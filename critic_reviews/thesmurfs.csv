Rules When the word Smurf is used as a family-friendly substitute for an expletive (eg What the Smurf?) take a shot. When the Smurfs sing their happy indoctrination song take a shot. When the Smurfs conduct an unreasonably lengthy dialogue scene in front of a well-placed product shot. Whenever the Scottish Smurf Gutsy references his junk shot. Spurious Joan Rivers cameo double shot. Whenever Neil Patrick Harris gives a look like hed gladly put all the Smurfs (especially Clumsy) into a blender shot. Any scene where the human actors have to interact with the Smurfs but you can see they know full well theyre hugging thin air shot. Any lines that could be misconstrued as drug references (eg We all live in mushrooms Im collecting Smurf Root) shot. Whenever the evil wizard Gargamel (essayed with dignity-abandoning vim by Hank Azaria) stumbles across the Smurfs by coincidence even though theyve got all New York as their hiding place shot. When the plot moves forward via a deus ex machina dreamed up by David Lynch on ludes (eg Gargamels prison escape thanks to a moth army) shot.

This Enchanted-style fish-out-of-water scenario is mined for interminable product placement gags (Blue Man Group) and dreary fantasy-meets-modernity scenarios (Gargamel gets Tasered by the NYPD). Its done via a dim script that inundates conversations with the term smurf as a noun adjective and adverb and then wink-wink addresses the silliness of the iconic characters speech and their personality-based names and signature ""la la la-la la la"" song. Gosnell directs as if every scene must be either a nauseating roller-coaster ride or a syrupy melodrama resulting in a seesawing tone thats not stabilized by the presence of Neil Patrick Harris as a cosmetics company executive and expectant father forced to baby-sit the cheery computer-generated creatures. Amid loving hugs and embarrassing Guitar Hero performances with his new munchkin friends Harris learns from Papa the value of family and parenthood. More than that mushiness though its the possibility of this frantic film spawning sequels that truly inspires thoughts of smurficide.

There with that out of the way we can safely avoid all future punning. What will be impossible for you to avoid should you take on this mission is about 100 minutes of physical comedy. Pratfalls and kicked CGI cats Smurfs being tossed to and fro. Still this is to be expected and for the young humans amongst us these moments should prove relatively hilarious. For the adults in the room? I remained unmoved. Before we break down the plot of The Smurfs lets pause for a moment to reflect on the 3-D aspect of the film. Its pointless completely superfluous devoid of any value to the consumer. Its as if weve been asked to pay a toll for a road that we dont want to drive on. Why do I need equipment to watch a film? Im there to be entertained or enlightened and wearing glasses for average 3-D does neither. Ugh enough already. /Rant As for the plot of The Smurfs its relatively straightforward. Gargamel the evil wizard in Smurf-land attacks the Smurfs on their own territory. Through the magic of product placement they are transported to New York City. Gargamel (played by Hank Azaria in massive levels of makeup) follows them along with his excellently evil cat so its fortunate the Smurfs are taken in by Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays. Smurfette Papa Smurf Grumpy Clumsy and Gutsy are the five smurfs on the run and they use ""smurf"" for every third word or so. The gang needs to escape back to their enchanted village while Gargamel wants to extract their magical blue essence for use in his spells. Clearly were not dealing with anything too complicated here. Still to its eternal credit The Smurfs at least realizes how logically out of place it is for this generation. The ""smurf for every sentence"" topic is discussed and Smurfettes disparate gender is considered. Tim Gunn makes an appearance as does Madison McKinley she of ""I wore fangs on The Bachelor"" fame (which for the record was amazing). The fact that The Smurfs basically admits to the adults ""We know we know"" leaves one less bitter. They arent peddling Pixar but they arent pushing Poppers either. A basset hound makes a prominent appearance. We can build on this. What doesnt really fly is the cat vomit scene. And the occasional potty humor. Product placement and 3-D have already been mentioned but theyll feel overtly annoying should you enter the theater with your child. But for all the film has going against it it never reaches the true depths of despair. They made about 100 Smurf jokes but they left another 100 on the table. The CGI cat was fun and likely saved them from a Humane Society lawsuit. Hank Azaria deserves a paycheck after his years of service. Finally Neil Patrick Harris is impossible to work up a good hate for hes the perfect Smurf liaison to the real world. Once the solid factors are considered The Smurfs ends up being just below average it wont give you nightmares and small ones might dig it. Smurfs up. Grade C- Sorry thats terrible.

"The Smurfs movie review Critters overrun Manhattan in live action take on 80s cartoon |       NJ.com comments The Smurfs movie review Critters overrun Manhattan in live action take on 80s cartoon Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 29 2011 at 721 AM View/Post Comments Columbia PicturesNeil Patrick Harris with Clumsy Briany Smurfette Gutsy and Papa Smurf in ""The Smurfs."" The Smurfs in case youve managed to avoid them all these years are a happy band of about a thousand little blue men (and one little blue woman) who live in a mushroom forest and sing a song that goes something like ""La la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la."" Wait. That wasnt nearly annoying enough. ""La LA LA-LA-LA-LA LA-la-la-la-LA"" There. Thats better. Now just imagine that being sung by tiny blue castrati about a hundred times in a row while theyre chased around their forest by a clumsy wizard called Gargamel. By the 15th verse you may start wishing you had some mushrooms of your own. The poisonous kind. Someone in Hollywood must have been eating the other kind though -- you know the marching-bears-and-rainbows kind? Because its hard to imagine any way a clear-thinking person would give a bunch of charmless color-challenged Ziggy clones their own 3-D movie. Movie Review The Smurfs (PG) Columbia (102 min.) Directed by Raja Gosnell. With Neil Patrick Harris Hank Azaria. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains cartoon violence and bathroom jokes Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS I admit the Smurfs may have a certain appeal to people who were toddlers in the 80s. Also perhaps to citizens of the little guys native Belgium. (Im sorry but what is it with the Belgians? Tintin Smurfs mayonnaise on French fries -- I just dont get the appeal.) But on the screen the male Smurfs just seem like a B-movie version of the Seven Dwarves. And Smurfette with her tedious simper and love of miniscule dresses only looks as if a petulant Snooki held her breath until she turned blue. The movie imagining some sort of wormhole has our Smurfs going to the even more magical land of Manhattan. There they befriend the marketer for a cosmetics company and try to get home before the pursuing Gargamel extracts their prolific Papas precious ""essence."" And the less you think about that the better. Neil Patrick Harris who plays the beleaguered corporate guy is as game as ever and somehow manages not to lose his dignity. As his witchy boss Sofia Vergara makes a delicious meal out of the scenery. But as the live-action Gargamel Hank Azaria gives a performance so blindly overconfidently wretched youd think he was John Turturro. And the animated Smurfs rely on wink-wink ""jokes"" that consist of lines like ""What the smurf"" and ""You smurfed with the wrong girl"" and ""Are you smurfin kidding me?"" Although the tiniest children may laugh at the broadest gags theres nothing here to interest anyone over 5 and the 3-D is migraine-inducing with background objects going blurrily out of register. That two sequels have been announced is terrifying. The only interesting thing about the production was the recent controversy when some pundit suggested the entire Smurf saga functioned as a racist radical commentary with Gargamel standing in for ""evil Jewish capitalists"" and Papa Smurf representing Karl Marx. Which is frankly a load of smurf. But not as big a load as this movie.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Smurfs is the smurfiest movie youll smurf all summer - youll smurf until you smurf your smurfs Thats Smurf language folks. Get used to it because after a very long nap the little blue creatures three apples high have woken up in a Hollywood CGI and live-action family flick touted as the first of a new movie franchise. Movies The Smurfs The official trailer If you were a kid in the 1980s you likely caught the hugely popular Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon (maybe while eating Smurf Berry Crunch cereal) based on the original creation of Belgian cartoonist Peyo. In 1958 he popped the Smurfs into his comics series Johan and Peewit but soon gave them their own adventure tales. A comic strip and merchandising empire were born. But how to reintroduce the happy little blue social collective into todays franchise-driven entertainment landscape with its sophisticated pop-culture-savvy animated films carefully orchestrated to please both kids and grow-ups? Why through a magic portal of course The Smurfs reverses the usual direction of traffic. Whereas people like Alice or the siblings of the Narnia chronicles travel through a portal and discover a magical land full of fantastic creatures on the other side six Smurfs leave their magical village through a portal land in New York City and discover Neil Patrick Harris. Sitcom star Harris ( How I Met Your Mother) puts his smart-aleck chops to good use as Patrick Winslow a cosmetics company marketing executive who unwittingly brings home the Smurfs in a box on the eve of launching a major campaign. His pregnant wife Grace ( Glees Jayma Mays) is smitten and wants to help them but Patrick regards the Smurfs as pesky gremlins. The Smurfs are pursued through the portal by their nemesis Gargamel. Hank Azaria (known for his voices in The Simpsons) chews up the scenery as the bumbling wannabe wizard who comes across as an amalgam of Moe Szyslak Jerry Lewis and the child-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. His evil mission is to steal the Smurfs ""essence"" (snippets of hair etc.) and turn it into magical powers. (Every time Azaria used the word ""essence"" I kept thinking of General Jack Ripper in Dr. Strangelove - a somewhat disturbing connection to make while watching a family movie.) Theres plenty of irony jabs at pop culture and sight gags - The Smurfs riding on a top of a taxi are camouflaged against an ad for Blue Man Group - but a major ingredient is missing a kid. The Smurfs mostly takes place in a grown-up world of cosmetics advertising and expectant parents. Without a child character to interpret and join the action its a pretty dull way to introduce young viewers to the new blue crew.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Friday July 29 2011 400 AM Title The Smurfs With Hank Azaria. The small blue creatures escape from a wizard into New York City. Director Raja Gosnell (147). PG Cartoon-style violence. At area theaters. You know what youre getting with a movie called ""The Smurfs"" - if youre 5 you know from the poster it contains blue creatures ""three apples high."" If youre a parent who was 5 in the early 80s when these benign-but-tough imps created by a Belgian animator leapt into an American Saturday morning series you know that the creatures have names that describe their personalities that wizard Gargamel is the enemy and that they have a theme -""la la la-la-la-la"" -that still sounds like part of the J. Geils Bands hit ""Centerfold."" What you dont know is that once Gargamel (played with mania that looks like an aneurysm by Hank Azaria in full Sid amp; Marty Krofft-villain mode) follows the Smurfs through a portal which appears every blue moon into New York City theyre hardly distinguishable from other Times Square visitors. Theyre lost they natter on and eventually they  befriend a frazzled ad man (Neil Patrick Harris again part of a curious venture) about to become a father. The ad man and Papa Smurf voiced by Jonathan Winters bond. Smurfette voiced by Katy Perry for some reason finds a friend in the ad mans wife. Every other word is ""Smurf"" ""Smurf off"" ""No smurfing way"" etc. It always sounded strange; now it also sounds self-absorbed. Azaria channels his inner Charles Nelson Reilly which helps as does an evil emoting cat. Kids under 7 will likely giggle at some too-harsh pratfalls not care about a grown mans fear of procreation not get all the tiny innuendos and possibly miss how the movie is a fairly successful tourism ad for New York (FAO Schwarz gets prominent play). Director Raja Gosnell also made ""Scooby-Doo"" and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua."" At least for families this is a bit smurfing better than those. Magic moment As Gargamel emerges from Belvedere Castle he sees a surprise horde of blue ready to turn Central Park into a smurfin battlefield. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Hank Azaria Neil Patrick Harris Jayma Mays Sofia Vergara Director Raja Gosnell Running time 142 Release Opened Jul 29 2011  Editorial Review Big Apple blues for preschoolersBy Sean OConnellFriday July 29 2011Raja Gosnells ""The Smurfs"" is the smurfiest movie Ive ever smurfed. No wait. That sounds too positive. How about ""I wouldnt smurf Gosnells The Smurfs on my smurfiest enemy."" There thats better. Gosnell who plundered our Saturday morning memories for back-to-back live-action ""Scooby-Doo"" adventures relies on cutting-edge CGI and unnecessary 3-D wizardry to transport the pint-size heroes of our childhood from their native enchanted forest to noisy New York City. Once here the Smurfs interact with incredulous humans impart a little homespun wisdom and help make our grungy existence a tad more animated. Which means ""The Smurfs"" is exactly like Amy Adamss princess-in-Manhattan comedy ""Enchanted"" only far less clever kindhearted original exciting or entertaining. For the benefit of our readers who didnt grow up in the 1980s the Smurfs are the unusual creation of the Belgian cartoonist Peyo and their weekly adventures fueled an animated series on NBC from 1981 from 1989. The blue-skinned creatures stand ""three apples high"" wear white pants and a matching cap dine primarily on sarsaparilla leaves and smurfberries and reside in mushroom-shaped houses nestled deep in the woods. Because all Smurfs look the same theyre differentiated by adjectives which best describe their personalities be it Brainy Smurf Clumsy Smurf or Passive-Aggressive Smurf (I kid you not). This movie also deserves such a moniker. I nominate Obnoxious Smurf Dopey Smurf Idiotic Smurf or some other Smurf not to be named here given the films fondness for revolting toilet jokes. To be fair I liked ""The Smurfs"" back when the blue gnomes dominated weekend television. Granted I was 7 years old at the time which helps explain the attraction. [Full disclosure The 7-year-old in our family who has never seen a ""Smurfs"" cartoon in his life thoroughly enjoyed Gosnells feature and currently plans to dress as a Smurf for Halloween. Good thing hes not the critic here.] And so parents be warned Unlike family films produced by Pixar ""The Smurfs"" will only appeal to a pre-adolescent audience. Four credited screenwriters tasked with reintroducing ""The Smurfs"" to a new generation hatch a paper-thin plot that finds six Smurfs - led by Papa (Jonathan Winters) and Smurfette (pop singer Katy Perry) - sucked through a magical vortex and dropped into Central Park. Hot on the Smurfs blue trail is evil sorcerer Gargamel (Hank Azaria) and his feisty cat Azrael who somehow manage to pursue our adventurers to the Big Apple. Luckily the Smurfs take shelter with gentle Grace (""Glee"" star Jayma Mays) and her workaholic husband Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) who both need to be reminded that life moves pretty fast and if you dont stop to smurf the roses every now and again you just might miss the special moments. Not that Gosnells ""Smurfs"" has any special moments to share. Outside of a soaring opening sequence that follows the Smurfs as they ride on the backs of birds the 3-D is as unmemorable as the instantly forgettable storyline. The Smurfs may be expertly rendered using top-of-the-line digital technology but outside of a scene where greedy shoppers at Manhattans famed F.A.O. Schwartz try to buy Clumsy Smurf because they mistake him for the latest must-have toy not a lot is done to bring these magical visitors into our decidedly non-magical world. At least when the Muppets took Manhattan in 1984 we were treated to such ingenious celebrity cameos as Art Carney Liza Minnelli Brooke Shields and former New York mayor Ed Koch. ""The Smurfs"" has Azaria relieving himself in the middle of a restaurant and a digitally enhanced Azrael licking his privates. Now who wants to pay a few extra bucks to see that in 3-D?

Columbia Pictures Neil Patrick Harris in ""The Smufts"" (Columbia Pictures) Columbia Pictures Neil Patrick Harris in ""The Smufts"" (Columbia Pictures) The Smurfs"" is a lot like the characters theme song sweet repetitive and grating. The little blue beings so popular in the 80s have graduated to the big screen in a mix of live action and animation.Not much has changed for the Smurfs. They still live in mushroom homes in a medieval forest with evil wizard Gargamel and his cat Azrael in hot pursuit.When the film opens Papa Smurf (voiced by Jonathan Winters) has a vision that Clumsy Smurf (Anton Yelchin) will cause great danger for the rest of the group. Sure enough he leads Gargamel to the Smurfs village. While trying to flee six Smurfs escape in a magical vortex that sends them to the human world of modern-day Manhattan. Gargamel (the perfectly cast Hank Azaria) determined to capture the Smurfs dives into the vortex as well. Before he can get to them they find shelter with humans Patrick and Grace Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays). But the Winslows have troubles of their own. Patrick has just been promoted and is trying to deal with his demanding boss (Sofia Vergara). Grace is pregnant and worries that her husband is too caught up in his job to appreciate the joys of family life.The whole setup gives the chance to share life lessons -- the importance of family how to be true to yourself always live in the moment -- but because the moments come and go quickly they fail to hold any emotional weight. Plus the frequent chases with Gargamel drag on too long and Patricks job conflicts will likely bore kids -- and adults. But ""The Smurfs"" cutesy characters and slapstick humor will appeal to younger children who dont have a lot of options at the movies these days. Parents can appreciate the innocence of the movie no shootouts panda killings or overly adult jokes (even with Katy Perry voicing Smurfette). But be aware that it runs nearly two hours. Thats a lot of time to spend with the Smurfs.""The Smurfs""Two stars (out of four)  Rating PG  Run time 149  Content Mild rude humor and action Videos Watch a trailer for The Smurfs Jul 28 2011 (...)

Five little blue guys and a token female Smurfette sucked through a wormhole hide out from a sorcerer at marketing executive Neil Patrick Harris Manhattan pad in this relentlessly witless and cynical childrens movie packed with potty jokes product plugs and double-entendres along the lines of ""What the Smurf?"" What the Smurf indeed. Ineptly directed by Raja Gosnell -- the genius behind the ""Scooby-Doo"" features ""Big Mommas House"" and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" -- this cheesy-looking flick has lousy animation worse special effects and the most headache-inducing blurry 3-D since ""Clash of the Titans."" The animated 80s Hanna-Barbera TV show was based on a comic-book character that originated in 1958 in Belgium and may have been that countrys most dubious import since waffles. But the show was a masterpiece compared to this drecky borderline-sexist mix of animation and live action concocted by a team of writers whose credits include ""Daddy Day Camp"" ""Norbit"" and ""Zookeeper."" Hank Azaria does some major scenery chewing as the wizard -- relieving himself in a restaurant in front of Tim Gunn who really shouldnt give up his day job -- who with his CGI cat has a surprisingly violent climactic confrontation with the Smurfs in Central Park. Jonathan Winters voices the Smurfs Stalin-like leader with Katy Perry as Smurfette his sole female offspring (out of 99). Is there some unwritten law that George Lopez has to do voice work in every childrens movie? Its not as if hes good at it. Aside from a Marilyn Monroe homage the movie doesnt really do much with its Smurfs-out-of-water premise; ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" it aint. There are long sequences devoted to promoting FAO Schwarz and ""Guitar Hero"" (the blue guys sing and dance along to Aerosmith) though. The beloved Mr. Harris who has only been seen in bad features (""Beastly"" ""The Best and the Brightest"") this year maintains his streak with a character who works in the same Rockefeller Center office building as Justin Timberlake in last weeks ""Friends With Benefits."" I doubt this movies target audience will care much about Harris ambivalence about his wide-eyed wifes (Jayma Mays) pregnancy or his problems with his bitchy boss (Sofia Vergara). It may be going a little far to suggest that taking your little one to ""The Smurfs"" -- this seasons pre-K equivalent of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" -- borders on child abuse. But be warned that if you do in the films words youll be ""up Smurf creek without a Smurfing paddle.""

Credit Columbia Pictures Sure Smurfs are blue but who knew that they actually work blue?The funniest moments in ""The Smurfs"" a new 3-D movie featuring the old gang familiar from the 1980s television series are either raunchy or scandalous as much as that is possible in a half-animated film with a PG rating. Theres a scene in which a Scottish Smurf in a kilt recreates the Marilyn Monroe subway grate display. Theres a rude bit involving a portable toilet.Those grown-up winks along with an array of New York locations make ""The Smurfs"" a surprisingly tolerable film for adults. As for their children well who knows with kids? But at least the writers have cleverly built in enough Smurfology that todays youngsters will be able to get the basics of the blue universe.Fleeing their archenemy the evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria who is quite funny) a half-dozen Smurfs are sucked through a wormhole and into New York City with Gargamel and a nasty cat in hot pursuit. Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays play the young couple who befriend the Smurfs.Its somehow depressing that the story centers on whether Mr. Harriss character can come up with an advertising campaign that will sell cosmetics and the movie frequently reminds us that the gimmick of little creatures scurrying about in the human world (""Toy Story"" ""Gnomeo and Juliet"") is pretty worn out. But on a hot summer day ""The Smurfs"" is a decent enough excuse to haul the little ones into an air-conditioned theater.

The little blue trolls with the mushroom homes and the most aggravating theme song in musical history invade Manhattan in a bright broad live-action computer-animated comedy. It might not be the family film least insulting to its audiences intelligence this season (I prefer ""Hop"" and ""Rango""). Still ""The Smurfs"" has brains heart and style which will endear it to adults as well as young viewers. Through one of those handy portals that conveniently appear whenever mythical characters need to land in Nowadays U.S.A. Papa Smurf and half a dozen of his blue brood wind up in Central Park. Hot on their trail are eeeeevil wizard Gargamel and his cat Azrael. Hank Azaria is a figure of cackling scheming Dickensian villainy as the dastardly sorcerer and also the Wile E. Coyote in a live-action Road Runner cartoon. With aggressive male pattern balding and a potato nose he resembles the love child of James Taylor and Karl Malden. Cartoon-style sneakiness incarnate Azaria plays to the balcony in a deliciously overscaled performance. He skulks through the steam clouds issuing from many New York City grates and manhole covers; it looks mysterious and ""gives the skin a lovely glow."" His cat with the aid of computer-assisted expressions has a cavalcade of brilliant reaction shots and double takes. He contributes the years best performance by an actor with twitchy whiskers and a tail. When the cat has a long villainous laugh at the Smurfs certain demise his master chides ""Now youre milking it dont milk it."" The film does a nifty job of quickly establishing and skillfully sustaining a kind of fractured fairy-tale stylization. The Smurfs hide from their nemesis by concealing themselves against a Blue Man Group advertising placard and take shelter with harried ad executive Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and his pregnant wife Grace (Jayma Mays). Patrick who might be fired at any moment by his fire-breathing boss is wavering about being tied down to a new dependent. When the Smurfs run riotously amok in the couples tiny apartment (symbolizing human kids or just the troublesome burdens of adulthood) Patricks angst skyrockets. Is it possible that having antic little playmates around will allow Patrick to act like a kid again and appreciate his family? Well lets not give the game away. Patricks client is a cosmetics tycoon and the screenplay finds clever ways to place the Smurfs nemesis in her orbit and in conflict with Patrick. Gargamels oblivious reactions to the brave new world he has entered make for some inspired moments. Theres a pricelessly demented episode where he visits a swank restaurant fills up on ""this swill you call Dom Perignon"" and commandeers an ice bucket for a chamber pot. I did not see that coming. The movie combines vivacious grown-up appeal with mischief guaranteed to have children giggling. And a handful of moments like that one had the whole audience in a happy uproar. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Fans of old Smurfs may feel a little blue - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Fans of old Smurfs may feel a little blue By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Attention all 4-year-olds reading this review Youre going to love The Smurfs. And congrats on your reading skills. Columbia Pictures Oh my Smurf Clockwise from bottom left Clumsy Gutsy Brainy Smurfette and Papa flee through a wormhole and land in NYC. EnlargeClose Columbia Pictures Oh my Smurf Clockwise from bottom left Clumsy Gutsy Brainy Smurfette and Papa flee through a wormhole and land in NYC. Attention parents of said 4-year-olds You may want to bring something to read in the theater because theres not a whole lot in it for you in this big-screen adaptation of the 1980s TV cartoon. True kid fare isnt necessarily a bad thing this summer though Hollywood still clearly doesnt have many parents at the executive level. Not to worry here. Smurfs is utterly kid-friendly. You might guess its kid-produced were it not for the adult-orchestrated product placement. And there is plenty from distributor Sony including commercials for laptops Blu-ray players and video games. The tie-ins are a shame because there are a handful of genuinely sweet scenes in Smurfs promptly undone by adult actors and filmmakers who must believe that the little blue troublemakers couldnt maintain a film on their own. Thus we are introduced to Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and Grace (Jayma Mays) an expecting couple unprepared for the blue invasion that occurs when a band of Smurfs dives through a wormhole to escape the evil Gargamel (Hank Azaria) and winds up in New York. Harris and Mays are game enough even humming the Smurf theme by films end. But theyre reduced to cuddling tennis balls that will be digitally redone into Smurf characters that werent in the original show. About the movie The Smurfs  out of fourStars Neil Patrick Harris Jayma Mays Sofia Vergara Hank Azaria Director Raja GosnellDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG for some mild rude humor and actionRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Azaria is the human standout. He and his distrusting cat Azrael steal scenes particularly as Gargamel keeps pitching the cat through wormholes and asking ""Are you dead?"" And Jonathan Winters is wonderful as Papa Smurf. (He originally did Grandpa Smurf in the TV show.) But we need fewer cinematic updates and more of the original warmth that turned the cartoon into a virtual cult movement. Kids may walk out of the theater yakking in Smurfese. Parents may find themselves checking out DVDs to remind themselves of why they were fans in the first place.

"The Smurfs movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The SmurfsBy turns grating and cloying this misguided attempt at a 3-D family comedy is a project even Neil Patrick Harris cant save.July 29 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Brainy Papa Grouchy Gutsy and Smurfette in ""The Smurfs."" (Columbia Pictures / Sony...)To borrow the lingo of the little blue people who populate ""The Smurfs"" a What the Smurf? If that sort of bad ""blue"" pun as opposed to fun is to your little ones liking then parents you are in for a fingernails-on-the-chalkboard ahem treat. Whether the off-color word play makes you cringe for fear that the kids will actually get the joke or the ""la la la"" song haunts your nightmares this animated-live action hybrid is really more 3-D disaster than family comedy. Even Neil Patrick Harris who has proved he can save just about any sinking ship (see prime-time awards shows such as the Emmys or Tonys) cannot make this boat float. The film is based on characters that began life in the 1950s in a comic book by Belgian artist Peyo Culliford with the little blue gnome-like softies eventually turning up in lots of different media including a Saturday morning TV run that turned them into a mini-phenom here. Like Snow Whites dwarfs the Smurfs were defined by their traits with their appeal a blend of silliness and innocence that very young kids in particular were charmed by (until a big purple dinosaur distracted them). Director Raja Gosnell starts with the innocence but then loses his way in trying to pull off the hipster spin the script by J. David Stern David N. Weiss Jay Scherick and David Ronn is shooting for. Neither the movies sensibility nor its shortfalls come as much of a surprise since Gosnell has been carving a niche in the world of family comedies for a while now. Many of them involve digitally enhanced animal antics and none of them have been particularly creatively compelling a ""Scooby-Doo"" ""Scooby-Doo 2"" and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" for example a and he stays the course. It all begins in Smurf-land a cloying saccharine sun-drenched world of singing and dancing and virtually no discord except for the few lumps that come from being too close to Clumsy (voiced by Anton Yelchin). Oh and there is that nasty wizard Gargamel (a real Hank Azaria though my guess is hes hoping with the makeup you wont recognize him) on the other side of a permeable sort-of invisible wall whos obsessed with getting some Smurf essence. Things might just rock along with the Smurfs singing on one side of that wall and Gargamel fuming on the other but theres a blue moon rising. Its mainly just a plot device to help get the Smurfs from there to here as in New York City with Gargamel and his weird special-effects cat with attitude in hot pursuit. In the city the Smurfs are soon tangled up with Patrick (Harris) and Grace (Jayma Mays) a a young couple about to be parents. Hes got career issues and an ad campaign to come up with shes just doe-eyed lovely but a little worried about him. Soon enough their conflicts center around how to help the Smurfs make it back home and what lessons they can learn from Papa Smurf (Jonathan Winters). There are many good actors wasted as voices a Alan Cumming Fred Armisen and Winters among them a and in the flesh though the greatest disservice is to Azaria. Sadly there are no red shoes here and the wizard is a long way from Oz. Instead there are long long flat-footed chase scenes. And the interaction between animation and the folks in the real world well its clumsier than Clumsy. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com The Smurfs MPAA rating PG for some mild rude humor and action Running time 1 hour 47 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview The Smurfs 2 lives up to predecessors mediocre...July 30 2013Summer Movie Sneaks complete listApril 28 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentBlue MoonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-smurfs-20110729,0,1742025.story?track=rss",200,thesmurfs13,thesmurfs,latimes

Smurfs sweetly help one another smiling while la-la-la-ing their cheerful signature song in their village of adorable mushroom-shaped cottages.Just dont expect respect from older kids new to the Smurfnomenon.Warning to the unsmurfified Smurfs use smurf as a noun and as a verb and you may not be able to stop doing the same after the film.Given that cuteness has been the creatures calling card for five decades its unfortunate that The Smurfs amps up the cruelty of the evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria) which may scare its young audience.Gargamel has always been a bad guy but hes more threatening in human form. This is especially evident when the Smurfs remain animated and the whole film goes for in-your-face 3-D effects.A better choice might have been to go for one of the more tantalizing TV series plots. Kids might have liked the one where the Smurfs and Gargamel end up helping one another or the one where we find out that Smurfette (voiced by pop star Katy Perry) was created by Gargamel and then went over to the Smurf side (a detail dropped in passing in the film).Driving the plot is a push to get the Smurfs into our world. That happens when a handful of Smurfs fleeing from Gargamel escape into a vortex that opens only during a blue moon.The vortex leads them to New Yorks Central Park where they ultimately end up in the home of Patrick and Grace (the ever-appealing How I Met Your Mothers Neil Patrick Harris and Glees Jayma Mays) who are expecting a baby.Patrick learns daddy lessons from Papa Smurf (voiced by Jonathan Winters). He practices being a dad by choosing the safety of his tiny charges over his job as an ad exec.The best moments are when the Smurfs explore our world in FAO Schwarz where theyre mistaken for toys and their attempts at camouflage against a Blue Man Group poster.If only director Raja Gosnell (Beverly Hills Chihuahua) crafted more scenes like this rather than the plethora of potty jokes and the icky if slapstick scenes of Gargamel throwing around his cat. The nadir is when Gargamel gets his hands on a powerful wand -- a la Voldemort -- in a kiddie version of the final Harry Potter confrontation.For those who believed you cant get too much Potter it all goes to show that in this case you can.The SmurfsC+ Starring Neil Patrick Harris Jayma Mays and Hank Azaria with the voice talents of Jonathan Winters Katy Perry Alan Cumming Fred Armisen and George Lopez.

Or maybe he has to pay the smurfs.Who really knows? By the end of the inevitable The Smurfs movie the linguistic eccentricities of the tiny blue sprites reach a Yoda-like level of inconsistency.But once youre done trying to conjugate the smurfs theres a better movie than anyone could have possibly expected thanks in large part to an honest effort by Harris in a thankless role.For those who have viewed the commercials even a passable big-screen The Smurfs will seem like a miracle. But this is the rare movie where the worst parts are in the promos. Parents who drew the short straw will be pleased to find that the movie isnt god-awful. Its refreshingly mediocre. Put that blurb on the DVD jacket.The Smurfs begins in a small village a live-action version of the psychedelic-looking world from the popular comics and Saturday morning cartoons. A vortex pulls the animated Papa Smurf Clumsy Smurf Smurfette and others into Central Park they meet marketing pro Patrick Winslow (Harris) wreck his house destroy - then save - his career and get pursued by evil forces for reasons that never make sense. In other words its just like an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" film.A suggestion for adult chaperones Find excuses to leave (more popcorn meter-feeding a game of Angry Birds in the lobby . . .) anytime the scheming wizard Gargamel comes on screen. Hidden under prosthetics Hank Azaria compensates for his lack of good lines and repulsive makeup by overacting.The Smurfs gets better from there. Theres a sporadic wit - jokes are plentiful about the 99-1 male/female ratio in Smurfland.Harris mostly acting against Marshmallow Peep-sized animated creations is convincing and likable throughout. No doubt he will poke fun at his participation in this film the next time hes hosting an awards show but dont be fooled. It takes a good actor to save a bad movie.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Smurfs continues the improbable journey of a tribe of little blue gremlins from the pen of a Belgian comic-book artist in 1958 to the multi-tentacled entertainment franchise of today. Would Peyo (real name Pierre Culliford) recognize the charmingly simple critters he originally dubbed ""Schtroumpfs in this noisy formulaic family film? The best thing about ""The Smurfs is that the answer is probably yes.In most respects the movies pure Saturday-afternoon kiddie product as close as you can come to popular CGI/live-action crud like ""Alvin and the Chipmunks and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua without the lawyers getting involved. Early on six of the major Smurfs from Smurf Village are whisked through a magic portal to Manhattan where they befriend human costars and scramble past the usual tourist landmarks on their way back home.There is creepy animal CGI. There is needless 3-D. There are random movie quotes. (Grouchy Smurf crossing the street ""Im walkin here and really now the Venn diagram overlap between audiences for both this movie and ""Midnight Cowboy has to be minimal. In fact I think Im it.) The voice of Grouchy is provided by George Lopez who truly has to be stopped. In all the worst parts of ""The Smurfs can probably be summed up in two words Smurf rap.Then there are the good parts or the less painful parts for parents and other stray adults who find themselves in attendance. The human couple befriended by the Smurfs are played by Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays the latter leaving her nervous energy back on the ""Glee set and appearing refreshingly relaxed. Harris manages to class up whatever he touches even if the sight of him repeatedly hitting himself with an umbrella probably wont go on the career highlight reel.As the villainous wizard Gargamel Hank Azaria gets to put on a baldy wig and fake buck-teeth and overact as broadly as he can. A little of this goes a long way unless youre 6 years old which is the point. Sofia Vergara of TVs ""Modern Family also shows up as Harriss meaniepants boss but she shares the screenplays confusion as to what exactly shes doing here.""The Smurfs wears its cross-promotional crassness on its sleeve. A scene set in FAO Schwarz makes room for product placement of all kinds with Marss Mamp;M candies emerging as the most shameless offender. And I hate to be PC but does Smurfette - the lone female Smurf in the movie - have to be a shopaholic twit? If they can give her the voice of Katy Perry cant they give her some of Perrys girl-power oomph? Heck send her to Columbia Business School and let her take over the long-range financial planning of Smurf Village.The other characters will be familiar to fans of the comic and the iconic 1980s Saturday morning cartoon. Clumsy Smurf (voiced by Anton Yelchin) is the adorably klutzy hero backed up by Grouchy Smurfette Brainy (Fred Armisen) and the doughty kilt-wearing Gutsy (Alan Cumming). Leading them all is Papa Smurf whose gentle wisdom remains the most appealing aspect of ""The Smurfs for kids and grown-ups alike.

Unleashing the blue crew on the streets of New York this chucklesome fish-out-of-water romp packs enough self-aware humor to keep chaperones and nostalgists awake as it piles on the Manhattan mayhem. If the popularity of the conceptually similar ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" pics is any indication B.O. should be magical with an especially nice Smurf perf overseas. As will be familiar to anyone whos ever read Belgian artist Peyos original ""Les Schtroumpfs"" comics or who grew up watching the 1981-89 animated series on NBC the Smurfs lead a blissful vaguely crypto-Marxist existence their mushroom houses hidden in an enchanted forest ""where feeling blue is a good thing."" Blue is also the color of the enchanted vortex that teleports Papa Smurf (voiced by Jonathan Winters) and five of his countless children to present-day Gotham pursued by the evil beak-nosed sorcerer Gargamel (Hank Azaria hideous and hammy) and his feline familiar Azrael (realized via a combo of live cats and CGI and voiced by Frank Welker). Through a series of mishaps caused by the aforementioned Clumsy (Anton Yelchin) the Smurfs are forced to reveal themselves to a friendly Manhattan couple Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and the very pregnant Grace (""Glees"" Jayma Mays) who once the shock wears off agree to help them evade Gargamel and find their way home. Of course Smurfys Law dictates that anything that can go wrong will and soon these sentient plush toys are running amok in Times Square causing a ruckus at a department store and inevitably jeopardizing Patricks marketing job at a high-end cosmetics firm. Setting clueless fantasy characters adrift in bustling New York is a time-honored movie tradition that has yielded rich comic dividends in the likes of ""Elf"" and ""Enchanted."" Unlike those human-centric pics ""The Smurfs"" has tiny mythical creatures to contend with and their antics tend toward the noisy nearly-getting-hit-by-a-car variety with a few dollops of obligatory but not unduly crass bathroom humor. While hardly sophisticated enough to transcend its strictly-for-kids designation the script (credited to four writers) does wink knowingly in the direction of attentive adults; an early scene in which Gargamel calls out the kink factor of having 100 Smurfs but only one Smurfette (Katy Perry) is funny enough that one wishes it were longer. But apart from having characters comment regularly on how irritating the Smurfs ubiquitous theme song is the pic keeps its self-parodying instincts mostly in check. More time is spent espousing earnest family-friendly lessons about the importance of embracing adventure realizing your self-worth and in one unexpectedly touching tete-a-tete between Patrick and Papa Smurf being a good dad. As directed by Raja Gosnell by now a dab hand at blending CGI critters with live-action settings (""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" the ""Scooby-Doo"" pics) ""The Smurfs"" hits its life-affirming mall-wrecking beats with practiced polish and nary an objectionable or unpredictable moment. The fact that the Smurfs are fantastical beings from a parallel dimension does allow the films animation/vfx crew to get away with some less-than-seamless integration work; a scene in which Patrick embraces the little blue guys brings new meaning to the term ""awkward hug."" Still Harris and Mays make appealing enough human anchors and Azarias high-camp wizard when battling his Smurf adversaries always seems to be interacting with characters rather than bluescreens. As with the bigscreen versions of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and ""Yogi Bear"" the addition of texture and dimension -- here in the form of bright blue eyeballs and pastel-light skin tones -- winds up compromising some of the low-rent charm that made the characters appealing in the first place. These Smurfs grow on you to be sure though less endearingly than their comicstrip prototypes (briefly glimpsed in one self-referential sequence). The eye-tickling 3D enhancement is most apparent in the Smurf-sucking portal and an opening tracking shot through the enchanted forest. Some additional musical backing such as the classical pieces often used in the TV show would not have been unwelcome.

This cherished New York institution was already overrun by Jim Carrey and a gaggle of pooping seabirds in this summers ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" and now its being invaded by obnoxious blue imps in ""The Smurfs"" a film that does for childrens entertainment what lead paint does for childrens toys. A big-screen regurgitation of the diminutive characters who have been around since the 1950s -- but are best known for their 1980s Saturday morning cartoon -- ""The Smurfs"" wants to relaunch the franchise to a new generation of kiddies while ironically deconstructing the little blue bastards for nostalgic Gen Y-ers. The result is neither fish nor fowl but instead a poopy cerulean diaper ""The Smurfs"" is too moronic and cringe-worthy for adults -- bring on the toilet jokes and the soon-to-be-dated cultural refernces -- and even the kids at the screening I attended seemed mostly bored except when Hank Azarias evil wizard Gargamel would fall into things. There are a few mildly amusing moments involving the ongoing abuse of Gargamels cat Azrael an almost entirely CG creation but I wouldnt want to be a parent stuck explaining to the kids why its not OK to throw Fluffy at the wall. The plot such as it is involves Gargamel chasing a handful of Smurfs through a vortex that takes them all to New York City and before long Smurfs Papa (Jonathan Winters) Clumsy (Anton Yelchin) Grouchy (George Lopez) Brainy (Fred Armisen) Gutsy (Alan Cumming) and Smurfette (Katy Perry) are all crashing at the Manhattan apartment of marketing guy Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and his wife Grace (Jayma Mays of ""Glee""). If anyone deserves pity here -- apart from the luckless parents who get dragged to this thing by their offspring -- its Harris and Mays who are not only forced to recite dopey and unfunny dialogue but theyre also forced to do so opposite a bunch of tennis balls that would later be replaced by animated Smurfs. The animation itself isnt bad as far as these things go but the voice acting ranges from the adequate (Winters Yelchin) to the irritating (Perry and especially Lopez). Poor Tim Gunn so droll and dignified on ""Project Runway"" camps it up miserably as the assistant to cosmetics exec Sofia Vergara. Youd think that after years of kissing up to Heidi Klum he could do this sort of thing in his sleep but he goes all extra-prissy resorting in the kind of limp-wrist overdrive that you usually get from clueless straight actors. In Richard Linklaters landmark indie ""Slacker"" one character comments that the ""Smurfs"" TV show was designed to get kids used to seeing blue people so they wouldnt freak out when Vishnu returned. One imagines the Hindu deity taking one look at this movie and saying ""Uh yeah thanks but Im good."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Neil Patrick Harris Jayma Mays and Sofia Vergara star in the 3D feature directed by Raja Gosnell. Further proof that Hollywood seems to have no intention of leaving any 80s pop culture touchstone unturned arrives this weekend in the 3D-enhanced form of The Smurfs the beloved Belgian comic book characters-turned-Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning staple. Notably less genteel than the Smurfs of yore this noisy live action/animated rendering of those wee mushroom-dwellers doesnt bother trying to capture the essence of what made the Pierre ""Peyo"" Culliford-created characters such a curiously endearing phenomenon. Instead two teams of writers have slapped down a thoroughly uninspired template that essentially swaps chipmunks for ""Schtroumpfs"" (their original name) setting them loose in the big city (here its New York) with typically chaotic results. For all the digitally enhanced Smurfness the results are remarkably mirthless. While its safe to say those other three-dimensional blue guys namely James Camerons Navi wont have to watch their backs Columbia Pictures could still count on those endless TV reruns and wistful parents to generate some moderate business. Just barely escaping the clutches of ruthless evil wizard Gargamel (a latex-swathed Hank Azaria) Papa Smurf (still Jonathan Winters after all these years) Smurfette (Katy Perry) and company dive into a magical portal that whisks them from their idyllic village to Central Park. But theres little time for sightseeing what with Gargamel hot on their trail and they subsequently find themselves shacking up in the cozy apartment of a nice guy marketing exec (Neil Patrick Harris) and his pregnant wife (Jayma Mays). Being the pro that he is Harris keeps the big wide-eyed reactions that tend go with the territory to an admirably restrained minimum as do his live action cohorts including Sofia Vergara as his diva CEO of a European cosmetics company boss Odile. Not that there isnt that much else to do what with a script credited to J. David Stem amp; David N. Weiss (Rugrats in Paris Daddy Day Camp) and Jay Scherick amp; David Ronn (Zookeeper) thats content to find its humor in lines like ""All right who Smurfed?"" Having previously helmed two Scooby-Doos and a Beverly Hills Chihuahua director Raja Gosnell could probably have done this one in his sleep which is likely where all but the most attentive of caregivers will helplessly find themselves drifting.
