STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 16 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Sam Peckinpahs Straw Dogs (1971) was filmed during a ceasefire in a marriage that saw him marry and divorce the same woman three times. The Wild Bunch director had also just been let go by Warner Bros. for bringing in The Ballad of Cable Hogue way over budget. He was supposed to film Deliverance next but that was suddenly off the table. A lyric poet who had problems with authority and substance abuse Peckinpah was in a bad way wandering about his Mexican hacienda shooting out mirrors. Movies Straw Dogs The official trailer One bender concluded with a tequila sunrise in rural England where he showed up mouth dry and head pounding to do a movie with Dustin Hoffman. But even here Peckinpah was shooting at himself. Hoffmans character was a bullied tormented academic - a mathematician who couldnt count on his wife Peckinpahs stand-in. In the original Straw Dogs every scene between husband David (Hoffman) and wife Amy (Susan George) exhibits a sick tugging Freudian undertow. And so we have the unhappy couple settling in for a quiet night at home Amy ""Kitty-kitty-kitty."" David ""Want a drink?"" Amy ""I cant find the cat."" David ""Doesnt answer my call."" Amy ""Do I?"" David ""You better."" The new Straw Dogs takes place in the rural American South where a Hollywood screenwriter (James Marsden) and his actress wife (Kate Bosworth) have come to work and relax. (Amy grew up here.) The film has one sly ominous touch Peckinpah would have liked. David is writing a script on the defence of Stalingrad a battle that swallowed two million lives. Otherwise the new version is a vigilante action film bereft of subtlety or restraint. The towns name is shorthand for backward and evil - Blackwater Miss. And David couldnt come off as more of a carpetbagger - wheeling into town in a Jaguar XKE wearing a Harvard T-shirt and ordering light beer. As in the original Amy meets up with a mean ex Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) who immediately demonstrates why she left Blackwater. Soon Charlie and pals are working on Amys old barn soaking up Davids beer and playing three-guitar Southern boogie on a machine cranked to 11 - having themselves a time. When Amy goes jogging dressed in an ounce or so of cotton the men turn polecat. Amy is upset. Sensing hes getting in over his 400 haircut David suggests she wear a bra. Finally David Amy and Charlies polecats stage their own re-enactment of the Battle of Stalingrad with David besieged by his wife and five men with rifles and in the requisite Southern touch torches. The final battles are traced from Peckinpahs original. Yes there is even a coiled bear trap. But whereas in the first Straw Dogs the most interesting fight is between husband and wife (and by extension David and himself) here the domestic dispute is of almost no dramatic consequence. Instead we get a routine if rather gruesome thriller with attractive leads ducking in and out of danger. And the films Southern Gothic trappings are strictly for tourists - James Woods as an old football coach wearing a Bear Bryant houndstooth hat shouting corn-pone gibberish; there is also a slow-talking sheriff a vacant cheerleader bent on trouble and a poor unfortunate wandering about town waiting to get done in by a hateful liquored-up mob. Dixie chucks and chicks. Writer-director Rod Lurie lives in California of course. Someone should whack him upside the head with a Eudora Welty short-story collection. A pile of Drive-By Truckers CDs would also suffice.

"Straw Dogs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; straw-dogs ) Straw Dogs (United States 2011) September 17 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sam Peckinpahs 1971 adaptation of Gordon Williams novel elicited more controversy than the uncompromising director expected in large part because of the unflinching and somewhat ambiguous depiction of a double rape. In addition to the unexpurgated edition Straw Dogs exists in numerous cut versions each of which trims down this sequence in many cases to the detriment of the film. Despite its brutality or perhaps because of it Straw Dogs became a cult classic although its infamous violence almost seems tame by the standards of a motion picture era that has embraced slasher films and torture porn. Director Rod Luries adaptation does not shy away from the kind of gut-wrenching violence remembered from Peckinpahs interpretation (in fact it may be more gruesome in some instances) but it is unlikely to generate much in the way of controversy unless its the one that accompanies any remake why is this necessary? Lurie whose bread-and-butter has been more cerebral thrillers would seem an odd choice to direct Straw Dogs but he remains faithful to the 1971 screenplay. Unlike the slew of recent filmmakers embarking upon remakes Lurie does not claim he has ignored the earlier film and is basing his version entirely on the original source material. Indeed if anything Lurie is shortchanging Williams novel and working primarily from the Peckinpah/Goodman script. The changes are minor - the setting has been moved from England to the United States Gulf Coast the profession of the protagonist has shifted from that of mathematician to screenwriter and the town drunk has become a belligerent ex-football coach. Although the time period has jumped forward 40 years one might recognize this only upon careful reflection. The town in which Straw Dogs takes place appears trapped in the 70s. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth are David and Amy Sumner a young Hollywood couple who have come to her hometown for a respite from the hustle-and-bustle of California. He wants a quiet place to write; she is more ambivalent about the return to her roots. No sooner have they arrived in his vintage Jag than they encounter Amys high school flame Charlie (Alexander SkarsgAY=rd) whose easy smile hides darker motives. David eager to make friends hires Charlie and his three cronies (Rhys Coiro Billy Lush Drew Powell) to rebuild his barn. Thats when the psychological games begin with the workers arriving at the crack of dawn drinking on the job (and walking uninvited into the house to pilfer beers from the refrigerator) and knocking off early to go hunting. Amy becomes increasingly irritated at Davids passivity when it comes to confronting Charlie about this. What she may not realize is that a silent unspoken alpha-male territorial battle has begun. In the end Charlies brutally direct approach forces David to change tactics. Straw Dogs is disquieting primarily because what seems on the surface to be a clear-cut battle between ""good"" (as represented by the sunny Hollywood couple) and ""evil"" (as represented by the Deliverance-inspired rednecks) turns into a more ambiguous struggle. If theres a message to be uncovered its about how thin the veneer of civilization is and how easily a cultured intelligent man can be reduced to where hes defined by his baser instincts. To fight Charlie David must descend to his level. He cannot reason with Charlie or charm him or best him in an intellectual struggle. Charlie is a product of the kill-or-be-killed mentality in which the strong take what they want and the weak perish. But is David really ""good""? On the surface that may seem to be a ridiculous question but it doesnt take much digging to discover that Lurie like Peckinpah is fascinated by the idea that the seemingly mild non-confrontational pacifist may be the villain in all of this. His presence instigates much of the violence. He evidences a dismissive superior attitude toward the denizens of the town. His smile is a smarmy half-smirk. He belittles their god and insults their pastor. His passive-aggressive approach results in his wife committing an act of overt stupidity. Charlie amp; company are doing what they are programmed to do; David is pushing their buttons. Because the screenplay represents David and Amys perspective we are apt to root for them but theres an unproduced version of Straw Dogs from Charlies vantage point that might tell a different tale. Luries approach to the rape is more straightforward than Peckinpahs depicting it as an act of violence rather than something Amy might have enjoyed on some level. During the home invasion standoff at the end Lurie wrings significant tension from the situation. The cat-and-mouse games between the inhabitants and the invaders generate more suspense than when Peckinpah choreographed them. However the subplot involving the ""village idiot"" (Dominic Purcell) is poorly shoe-horned into the proceedings. This inclusion is an extraneous appendage that Lurie fails to make relevant until the climax (if then). Marsden is adequate as the laid-back screenwriter and Bosworth does a good job with the internal conflict evident in a character whose love-hate relationship with her hometown extends to her ex-boyfriend. SkarsgAY=rd the object of many womens dark fantasies from his role in True Blood uses his tight smile and dead eyes to good effect. Hes chilling but his good manners never make him seem like an unspeakable monster. That part goes to James Woods whose ferocity is frightening. Woods has played his share of psychopaths and criminals; his work here can stand alongside the best of them. The actor dominates every scene in which he appears no matter who else is sharing the screen. Although the moral ambiguity of Straw Dogs has been softened in the remake the message and the forceful way in which it is delivered remain the same. The movie is unsettling and despite a generous helping of suspense in the final half-hour one does not feel like cheering for the protagonists when they score a hit during the climactic conflict. As unnecessary but not necessarily unwelcome remakes go this one represents an acceptable update of a non-mainstream title. Cinematic history will remember Peckinpahs Straw Dogs but Rod Lurie has nothing to be embarrassed about.

James Marsden plays David Sumner a successful Hollywood screenwriter who moves cross-country with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) a TV actress returning to her fathers abandoned home in the backwoods of Mississippi. He spends his days working on a screenplay about the siege of Stalingrad while shes bored jogging bra-less before a crew of local rednecks when shes not petting her cat. Among the crew is Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) ex-quarterback of the revered local high school team. He and Amy had a thing back when she was head cheerleader but these days hes swinging a hammer so Sumner hires Charlie and his buddies to repair the roof of their barn. Tension mounts between Harvard boy Sumner and the good ol boys of the bayou gradually building toward a cataclysmic climax. Affable as always Marsden slips easily into the role of smart hip and successful city dude. He awkwardly tries to speak to the level of the rednecks but what he thinks is ingratiating comes off as covertly frightened. Its a tough role and its wide arc runs the gamut from inertia to kinesis ending in rage and bloody violence. Bosworth endures physical and emotional duress as local hero Amy the towns prodigal daughter returned. Skinny blond and beautiful she stands in stark contrast to the corpulent townsfolk so its no surprise that she lifts the spirits of the redneck crew -- although it strains credulity although angry with her husband that she would flash her breasts at them. James Woods delivers a grand performance as Coach the paternal figure of the crew who once led Charlie to championships on the gridiron and now leads his former players to a horrifying showdown with Sumner. Woods strikes pretty much one note yes which he hammers for all its worth. The standout here is Skarsgard as Charlie whos charismatic smart bold -- and a psychopath. The ""True Blood"" star delivers a fascinating character study exhibiting compelling leadership qualities mixed with repellent homicidal tendencies. Its his sincerity and not his powers of seduction that wind up being his most dangerous weapon. Former film critic Rod Lurie broke big with his second feature ""The Contender"" back in 2000 and followed strongly with ""The Castle"" but has since been on a bit of a slide. Here he exhibits an uneven hand working deftly with the camera (collaborating once again with cinematographer Alik Sakharov who shot Luries 2008 ""Nothing But the Truth"") but struggling with his actors. Marsden and Bosworth most notably never achieve enough chemistry to convince you they are husband and wife. Its not entirely their fault as they are hamstrung by a critical change from the original 1971 film where Dustin Hoffman played a mathematician working on a cutting-edge theory. His world is so far outside his wifes that it impacts their relationship in a way that makes the films climax both organic and inevitable. By making Sumner a screenwriter and his wife an actor Lurie puts his characters professionally and psychically in the same world she is more likely to understand his process rather than to feel excluded. If youve seen the original ""Straw Dogs"" you probably expect the remake to be awful. Shockingly it comes off as an adequate potboiler building in intensity mostly by banal means but it offers occasional inspired moments such as Skarsgards performance and especially the climactic windup which packs a punch similar to its predecessor. Unfortunately most of the new films strengths are inherited from the original while its weaknesses stem from the changes. ""Straw Dogs"" was not a film crying out to be remade but they did anyway -- and you know what they say about lying down with dogs. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Whereas Sam Peckinpahs controversial 1971 film Straw Dogs pitted David (Dustin Hoffman) a meek American mathematician against English country folk Rod Luries update plants a Hollywood screenwriter (James Marsden) in small-town Mississippi and allows similar instigation to unfold. The local pack is led by Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) who still lusts after one-time cheerleader and girlfriend Amy (Kate Bosworth) even when she brings home a husband as godless and passive as David is. It doesnt hurt that Skarsgard himself boasts a good six inches of height over Marsden and nearly a foot over Bosworth -- hes initially all smiles but it doesnt take much for him to assert his dominance over either in any given conversation or confrontation and Lurie has a clever habit of framing David within the crooks of Charlies arms trapping our protagonist even when hes doing something as simple and naive as asking Charlie and his fellow roofers to keep their work down in the early morning hours. Alas that ends up being the most subtle indication of a shifting power dynamic that the writer/director can muster. Everything seems much more phallic here whether gun barrels chess pieces hammers or bottles of Bud and extreme characterization is favored over extreme action. David cant just be a West Coast liberal type; he has to be a condescending dolt who doesnt know how to change a tire or handle a gun who cant be bothered to sit through a church sermon and who favors classical over country music. Better yet he drives a mint-condition Jaguar while Charlies crew rolls around town in a pick-up truck with antlers attached to the front -- frankly Im surprised that Lurie didnt go so far as to make the truck model a Dodge Ram. Climactic foreshadowing runs rampant -- chess matches football games war re-creations -- while the originals intimations of a pacifist fleeing Vietnam-era protest are short-changed in favor of a cursory mention of the local sheriffs time spent in Iraq. No no David just really wants to work on his screenplay and Amy finds herself frustrated first with her husbands refusal to engage the locals and their traditions and then with his refusal to defend her honor and their marriage -- until things turn bloody in the third act. This is when David decides that the least he can do is protect town invalid Jeremy (Dominic Purcell) from the hot-headed likes of town drunk Tom (James Woods) especially when it appears that the former mightve unwittingly killed Toms daughter. Prior to the confrontation Tom fails to see his teenage daughters advances on the older slower man only swearing that he better keep away. What her interest is we never really know except for maybe serving as a foolhardy counterpoint to a sexually-assaulted Amy -- one character invites trouble while the other watches trouble barge in through the front door. It should be said that Bosworth is better than usual here or at least challenged more as an actress given that her career to date hasnt really asked for much resentment or helplessness out of her performances. While it still seems like Marsden could hold his own against any man if he just lost the glasses hes boxed in by this versions more conventional arc; whats great about Hoffmans work in the role is that he and Peckinpah didnt care whether or not we were left rooting for him in the end so long as his newfound sense of cool even heartless rationale was apparent (a quality instead adapted and well by Skasgard). To see Marsden play things meekly is hardly convincing and to see him save the day is hardly surprising. And of course theres a tidy speech shoehorned in that spells out the significance of the title and naturally Amy has to explicitly ask whether or not she deserves her leering admirers while Peckinpahs film did it without saying a word and was all the more fascinating for it. Everything here plays out to the same beats and yet ultimately results in conventional revenge-minded catharsis rather than queasy ambivalence (just how much of this can be pegged on a modern moviegoing audience conditioned to blindly cheer on violence Im not sure). Call it anything else and this isnt bad for a pulpy home-invasion thriller eager to escalate the stakes while demonstrating a more muscular and direct sense of filmmaking than we usually get from the likes of Lurie and his polemic-heavy dramas. Call it Straw Dogs though and it cant help but pale in comparison to a truly provocative film.

(Screen Gems) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 16 2011 400 AM Title Straw Dogs With James Marsden Kate Bosworth. Thriller about L.A. newlyweds who move to a conservative Southern town. Director Rod Lurie (150). R Language graphic violence including rape. At area theaters.Like its predecessor Rod Luries ""Straw Dogs"" is very much a movie of its moment. While Sam Peckinpahs 1971 original grappled with sexual politics in ruthless fashion Lurie clearly has other issues to work out.Though the present state of masculinity is a target his focus is ultimately more political than sexual.It takes courage to accept roles still so strongly associated with Susan George and Dustin Hoffman. But Kate Bosworth and especially James Marsden are excellent as Amy and David Sumner newlyweds whove traded L.A. for Amys Mississippi hometown.Now a successful actress she suspects it wont be easy to return. David a preppie screenwriter has no idea whats waiting.Soon enough though he starts to see trouble in every face Amys ex-boyfriend (a miscast Alexander Skarsgard) the towns retired coach (James Woods) the cadre of former football players who need an outlet for their festering aggression. Davids Harvard T-shirts and chess set add fuel to a fire thats been stoked since Amy dared leave a place so proud of its own ways and suspicious of others.I was concerned a remake of such a brutal story would wind up pure exploitation but like Peckinpah Lurie has adapted Gordon Williams novel ""The Siege of Trenchers Farm"" with some contemporary themes in mind. Though ugly violence remains the real enemies are no longer male and female but red and blue.It would be unfair to compare this film to the original as the times and therefore the stakes are so different. Lurie is also significantly kinder to his characters. Marsden - possibly the most undervalued actor around - gets the pitch exactly right.Idealistic and ineffectual a wealthy intellect who proudly values logic over faith David is shocked to find his liberal values met with hostility. His fancy education never taught him that outsiders only have two choices fit in or be willing to fight.While Lurie could have gone lighter on the symbolism he ratchets up the tension with deft intelligence. Hes not just making a thriller but a horror film and we feel his own fear in every scene.Magic moment You may be as shocked as David is to find yourself rooting him on to violence.

Straw Dogs"" is one of those movies that sits in an armchair smokes a pipe and reflects ""seriously"" on ""the question of violence"" but the main reason to see it is for the hilariously nasty uses it devises for a bear trap nail gun etc. In a remake by writer-director Rod Lurie James Marsden plays a nerdy Hollywood screenwriter named David Sumner who wafts into Blackwater Miss. to work on his script with his actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) a native of the little town who is now the star of a TV crime show. The two of them move into her childhood home. Her ex-boyfriend Charlie (a magnetic Alexander Skarsgard who gives by far the best performance) is a busted high school football star who now works in construction and offers his crew to repair the couples roof. Charlie is an angry lout who starts behaving in increasingly menacing ways but then again David drives a convertible Jaguar (with a fake hood ornament) wears Harvard Lacrosse T-shirts and orders Bud Light in the saloon -- so for whom are we supposed to root? As Charlies manliness starts to make David look small Amy grows increasingly frustrated and even does a striptease that Charlie and his roofers can see. Amy is in short asking for trouble but her supposedly complex character is a muddle. Her actions dont make any more sense than the plot which takes many improbable and self-deflating turns (one shocking moment is followed by a scene in which Amy smiles and serves beers on a platter another by her suggesting an outing to a football game). If you thought some rednecks meant to do you harm would you really go hunting with them? Instead of concentrating on the mano a mano struggle between the omega-male softness of David and the brutishness of Charlie the story gets distracted by the histrionics of James Woods as a drunken ex-football coach who flies into a rage whenever the local pervert/creep/Boo Radley figure gets near his cheerleader daughter. (She also turns out to be the author of her own misfortunes in another scene that is sure to rile feminists.) The idea of an intellectual being driven to a sadistic orgy of violence was shocking in the 1971 original film which starred Dustin Hoffman and was directed by Sam Peckinpah but bloodshed simply doesnt register on audiences the way it used to. Moreover to put it mildly the Rod Luries of the world shouldnt be too eager to be mentioned in the same sentence with Sam Peckinpah. When Peckinpah got the retribution going the audience wasnt hooting (as it did on 42nd Street Wednesday night when this film was screened). Today it seems inevitable and entirely justified that David should use any means at his disposal to defend himself and his wife so why does it take Lurie so long to get to the point? His finale when he finally gets to it is effectively trashy and rousing. Shorn of its unneeded subplot and its yokel stereotypes the film might have been a breathless piece of grindhouse art. As it is it mainly reminds you that in ""Coward of the County"" Kenny Rogers managed to tell pretty much the same story in four minutes instead of 109.

Starring Kate Bosworth James Marsden Alexander Skarsgard Dominic Purcell Laz Alonso Willa Holland James Woods Director Rod Lurie Running time 148 Release Opened Sep 16 2011  Editorial Review By Michael OSullivan Friday Sept. 16 2011 Movie remakes like musical covers are best when theyre more than slavish note-for-note copies of the original. They should introduce a twist on the original material luring not just new (and presumably younger) audiences into theaters but inviting them to think about that material in a different way.In that regard at least the remake of the Sam Peckinpah-directed ""Straw Dogs"" a taut bloody and deliberately disturbing thriller about a man defending his wife and property against a brutal home invasion does not disappoint. The adaptation by film critic-turned-filmmaker Rod Lurie (""The Contender"") is faithful to the controversial 1971 story without butchering it even as it pushes its themes of masculinity and the roots of violence into new and in this case political territory. Luries smart enough to know that were supposed to be disturbed -- and not titillated -- by the savagery the movie depicts.The question is Are we smart enough? A preview audience responded with whooping and scattered applause to the remakes horrific climax making me wonder whether the flaws in the new version or in us.In one of two big changes to the original Lurie relocates the drama from rural England to the Deep South. In the process he also turns its hero from a nebbishy American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) butting heads with violent British yobs into a Hollywood screenwriter adrift in Middle America (James Marsden arguably a stand-in for Lurie). What that means is this The clash at the center of the film is no longer between one man and a gang of random thugs but between two grand themes Left Coast liberalism and the culture of God guns and country. Its a showdown between red-state America and blue-state America.Almost immediately upon arriving in Blackwater Miss. -- a town whose name evokes unchecked aggression with its echo of the notorious Iraq war contracting company -- Marsdens David Sumner encounters a dangerously volatile situation. A Harvard-educated intellectual David doesnt hunt listen to country music follow football or believe in God all of which puts him at odds with the churchgoing sports-loving rural community in which he and his actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) find themselves after relocating from L.A. to the house she grew up in. Making matters worse is the fact that Amys old beau Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard smoldering in more ways than one) hasnt ever really gotten over her. Charlies like a ticking time bomb.So is everyone else in the film. From the towns angry and alcoholic former high school football coach (James Woods decked out in a Bear Bryantesque hounds-tooth hat) to Jeremy (Dominic Purcell) a developmentally disabled man with an unspecified history of inappropriate behavior with underage girls ""Straw Dogs"" is a minefield of unexploded human ordnance.But dont worry. Release of a sort will come. After suffering hazing and humiliation large and small -- including the execution of their pet cat and a creepy sexual assault -- David and Amy find themselves in a violent confrontation with the coach Charlie and Charlies hillbilly pals all of whom show up at David and Amys house one night drunk and looking to lynch Jeremy. Now holed up in David and Amys house after a tragic accident involving the coachs 15-year-old daughter (Willa Holland) Jeremy takes on a symbolic role here. Hes innocence personified. And David is his unlikely champion.The 1971 film was about how it was possible to win a fight while still losing everything including ones humanity. Its outcome brutal for the time left you shell-shocked by design.The new version wants to leave you reeling too. It tries to equate monstrous behavior -- not just Charlies or Davids but Americas -- with a society that condones and even glorifies violence. Football hunting Budweiser and inflammatory rhetoric from the pulpit all share blame for societys ills.Does Lurie have an ax to grind? And how. Yet if to some ears its high-pitched whine nearly drowns out the underlying story at times why did so many in that preview audience seem deaf to it?Maybe thats Luries real point A culture that feeds on violence -- in real life and on film -- has also inured us to it.Contains plentiful violence obscenity and sexual content.

Screen Gems From left Rhys Coiro James Marsden and Alexander Skarsgard in ""Straw Dogs"" (Screen Gems) Screen Gems Alexander Skarsgard in ""Straw Dogs"" (Screen Gems) Screen Gems Alexander Skarsgard in ""Straw Dogs"" (Screen Gems) More than 40 years ago director Sam Peckinpah turned heads and stomachs with films that exponentially increased the amount of violence in movies. ""The Wild Bunch"" started it all in 1969. Two years later he raised the ante with ""Straw Dogs"" a very good movie with Dustin Hoffman and Susan George.Rod Lurie directs this remake with generally good results but a couple of flaws hurt the final grade.A young screenwriter (James Marsden) and his actress-wife (Kate Bosworth) move back to her hometown in the South. Once in town hubby runs into all of the cliched inhabitants of Hollywoods Dixie the old football coach; the oversexed teen cheerleader; the dim-witted strong guy; and the former star jock (""True Bloods"" Alexander Skarsgard). To ingratiate himself with the locals hubby hires the ex-jock and his pals to fix the dilapidated barn on the property. I dont want to go into too much detail. Lets just say the old jock still sees desire in the eyes of Bosworths character his old sweetie and hes certain the wimpy screenwriter wont stop him.For the most part Luries remake serves as a credible update to the original and the performances from Skarsgard Marsden and Bosworth are solid. But there are two weaknesses that hurt the overall impact. First the original had the couple going to England to avoid violence in America. So when things go bad in England -- a more civilized place right? -- the message that man is a violent animal hits hard. Going to the Deep South with its embrace of football and hunting removes that important aspect of the films thematic equation. More damaging is Luries conspicuous ""red state"" rant as he makes sure that every prominent guy in this film -- save for the screenwriter and the black sheriff -- fits all of the Southern stereotypes. That doesnt make it a bad movie just one that is something less than Peckinpahs original.""Straw Dogs""Two and a half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 150  Content Strong brutal violence; a sexual attack; menace; sexual content; pervasive language Videos Watch a trailer for Straw Dogs Sep 15 2011 (...)

Alas the film buckles beneath Hollywood contrivances that stop it from becoming this years Inception a talker worth repeat viewings.Still Lurie informs his movie with plenty of nods to the original and at least manages a story that will have people talking -- if not about the nature of human violence then about the grisly depiction of it. Even by todays standards some scenes are jaw-dropping in their bloodshed.VIDEO See the trailerSTORY Interview with Alexander SkarsgardTo that end Lurie accomplishes some of what Peckinpah evoked 40 years ago when he cast Dustin Hoffman and Susan George as a couple hoping to escape Americas violence in the English countryside. This time around James Marsden plays screenwriter David Sumner hoping to escape the Hollywood lifestyle by relocating to Blackwood Miss. His wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) is a midtier TV actress who has something to hide in her hometown -- like the hulking Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) who leads a team of yahoo laborers tasked with fixing their roof.Instead the boys make themselves at home helping themselves to the beer -- and they have their eyes on the wife.About the movieStraw Dogs    out of fourStarsJames Marsden Kate Bosworth James WoodsDirector Rod Lurie Distributor Sony Pictures/Screen Gems Rating R for strong brutal violence including a sexual attack some sexual content and pervasive language Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Opens Friday nationwideLike the original the redo is a slow boil. Lurie does a nice job of building the friction between the newbies and locals. The film shines in its version of Amy. Bosworths steel-jawed heroine is a welcome alternative to Susan Georges more timid portrayal. Bosworth blends the right amount of toughness to be convincing as a rural refugee.But the movies last act is almost its undoing. Part of what made the first film so effective was its setting The quiet British countryside served as a jarring underscore to the violence.Theres no unexpected tension here though as Lurie cast his villains in the Deep South and appointed them the requisite Hollywood Huckleberry traits take more beer breaks than bathroom breaks quote the Bible and keep a gun handy.Bosworth too is ultimately undercut by the films near shot-for-shot remake of the infamous climactic home invasion. She is forced to quote 40-year-old lines that dont jibe with her modern Amy. Marsden is fine as a Joe pushed too far but no actor could match Hoffmans glassy bloodthirstiness.The failings arent enough to undo the new Dogs which makes an earnest attempt to examine whether violence is learned or natural (Lurie believes the former). And give the director this He pulls no punches in emulating the violence that made the first film so controversial. And while it may not become the cult classic of its predecessor Straw Dogs redux stays a literal cut above its crime brethren. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Comments (7) click to enlarge Straw Dogs Video Rated R  110 minutes  2011 Rod Lurie regrouping after the marginal release of his dumb political thriller Nothing But the Truth (2008) remakes the Sam Peckinpah classic about self-definition through violence. The original starred Dustin Hoffman as a meek mathematician who arrives in an English village with his sexy wife and becomes a target of local thugs; Lurie has turned the character into a Hollywood screenwriter (James Marsden) and transplanted the action to small-town Mississippi but otherwise the story is the same. What has changed however is the audience consuming it back in 1971 the Peckinpah film horrified moviegoers with its bloody climax whereas today people are so vengeful and sadistic that the remake is just another multiplex crowd pleaser. Rest assured though that the older movies flashes of frontal nudity have been responsibly eliminated. With Kate Bosworth Alexander Skarsgard and James Woods. By J.R.

His wife is a TV actress played by Kate Bosworth the once and future hometown queen of the town of Blackwater whose citizens believe in God football and guns. The couple in the 71 film were grimly mismatched thereby giving the story some fascinating tensions from the outset. The new ""Straw Dogs"" marrieds go together in the blandest possible way.The towns former high school gridiron hero (Alexander Skarsgard) now working as a contractor on the couples post-Katrina rehab cannot think straight when his ex-girlfriend (married to the godless milquetoast liberal writer) goes jogging braless. Every fevered glare points to the assault to come.""Are you saying Im asking for it?"" the Bosworth character says to her husband early on appalled. Lurie gives Bosworth lines such as this to make her a more progressive enlightened object of desire. This marks a change from the Peckinpah versions misogynist implications at least to many That she was asking for it.Peckinpahs film however is more provocatively complicated than its reputation. In the post-assault sections of the original the wifes trauma was vividly realized on screen. Lurie and his editor try some of that same eye-blink flashback strategy but its a mess -- all affectation and no intuition.Marsden and Bosworth are flyweight presences on screen. James Woods as the perpetually raging ex-coach who lights the fire that sets this corner of Mississippi burning again brings every kind of overacting to little avail. Only Skarsgard lends some detail and scary subtlety to his role and to a painfully useless film.mjphillipstribune.comStraw Dogs -- 1 starMPAA rating R (for strong brutal violence including a sexual attack menace some sexual content and pervasive language)Cast James Marsden (David); Kate Bosworth (Amy); Alexander Skarsgard (Charlie); James Woods (Tom Heddon)Credits Written and directed by Rod Lurie based on the 1971 film and Gordon Williams novel ""The Siege at Trenchers Farm""; produced by Marc Frydman.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr THE LAST STRAW James Marsden fights back against his yokel persecutors in Straw Dogs C+ Straw Dogs Genre Mystery and Thriller; Starring Kate Bosworth James Marsden Alexander Skarsgard; Director Rod Lurie; Release Date Wide 09/16/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted September 21 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Straw Dogs is a remake of Sam Peckinpahs scandalous 1971 what happens when a man is pushed too far? rabble-rouser which starred Dustin Hoffman as a gawky nerdish mathematician unaccountably married to an English sexpot with smeary lips and a taunting attitude. Hoffmans character spends most of the film getting humiliated talked down to and roughed up but hes compelled to find his manhood when circumstances force him to fend off the rural British goons who want to break into his home and do him damage. ""This is my house"" he says a geek drawing the line in the sand. Then the geek goes to work defending himself with guns nails pots of boiling water and (famously) a bear trap. Rod Lurie who wrote and directed the new Straw Dogs transplants the story from the English countryside to a small town in the Deep South and the characters are now a Hollywood screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his hottie actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth). Apart from that though the film sticks fairly close to Peckinpahs lurchingly obsessive glorified-exploitation-film story line. The new Straw Dogs is a sketchy oddball of a movie. Whats missing is the sensuality and danger that gave the original its lurid screw-tightening kick. Thats no surprise really. Sam Peckinpah was a bad boy -- drawn like an animal to raw flesh to the exploration of our darkest impulses. Years before the phrase ""politically correct"" was invented Straw Dogs like its cinematic cousin A Clockwork Orange (also released in 1971) was one of the most politically incorrect movies ever made. It featured a rape scene that dared to be not just nasty but erotic -- Susan George as the wife forcibly ""seduced"" by a scowling macho carpenter got turned on by being slapped and that was a hell of a thing to watch at the dawn of the feminist era. Ultimately the Hoffman character becomes as brutal as his adversaries which inspired Pauline Kael in a famous line of criticism to brand Straw Dogs ""a fascist work of art."" I never agreed with that sentiment. The movie was more like a Western pushed to the edge and done in a gloomy labored style that might be described as prestige grindhouse. Unfortunately Rod Lurie as a director is anything but a bad boy. A former film critic born in Israel he has mostly made earnest political parables (The Contender Nothing but the Truth) and the style he brings to Straw Dogs is closer to middlebrow megaplex. Its easy enough to say that James Marsden is no Dustin Hoffman but in this role hes so squishy and smiley and soft hes like a candy-apple James Franco. Marsdens David an ""enlightened"" male wimp in laceless designer sneakers and a Harvard lacrosse T-shirt is the kind of guy who plays classical music as he researches his screenplay for an awards-bait movie about the Battle of Stalingrad then unwinds by engaging his wife in late-night chess matches. The two have relocated temporarily back to her hometown following the death of her father and the moment they walk into the local bar (which is so macho it doesnt even serve Bud Light) David is supposed to be the effete yuppie out of water. Hes set up in contrast to Amys old flame Charlie a hunky Southern-fried Christian redneck played with a deadpan smile-slash-leer by Alexander Skarsgard of True Blood. Charlie and his carpenter pals who get hired to reroof the couples adjoining barn come on all friendly-like but we can see that theyre wolves. Is Amy the hometown girl still one of their kind deep down? When you remake a movie like Straw Dogs and preserve its basic hothouse outline but redo it cautiously with the sexual politics vetted and tamed you get a movie Im afraid thats a little off its rocker. At least Marsdens character makes sense; hes a guy fatally out of touch with his inner bruiser. But Bosworth has the unenviable task of playing a self-possessed upbeat contemporary chick with a dark underside that (given our era) is never too dark. When she suddenly flashes Charlie and his pals shes supposed to be straying into forbidden waters but it just looks like shes gone temporarily nuts. Shes a walking patchwork a postfeminist sexpot victim avenger. The last half hour in which Marsden fends off the attackers from inside his house is like a slasher movie with pretensions and on that level Lurie does an okay job. He leaves in the bear trap and updates it in a very satisfying way. Straw Dogs keeps you watching but on a primal level I never truly bought the movies violence and thats where Peckinpah ruled He had violence in his filmmaking blood which is why he could make it sting. The original Straw Dogs at least to me isnt close to being one of Peckinpahs masterpieces but its a movie that the people who first saw it still remember 40 years later. I doubt that anyone will remember the new one by next month.

More about Straw Dogs >> For those familiar with Sam Peckinpahs controversial 1971 film Straw Dogs Rod Luries faithful - yet surprisingly dissimilar - remake almost succeeds as an object lesson in the difference between being a man and being a macho animal. But it fails as a gripping home-invasion thriller. In both films a cerebral urban guy moves with his hot wife back to her rural birthplace where townies resent his success and her elevated social status. In both films the fractures in the marriage between urban guy David (bespectacled James Marsden in the remake) and hot wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) become chasms because emasculated urban guy fails to mark his territory and is not around to defend his wife from rape. In Luries remake Mississippi horn dogs come sniffing around Amy. But instead of setting boundaries David hires them to fix a roof blown away by Hurricane Katrina. One of them Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) a former high-school quarterback dated Amy when she was a cheerleader and would like to take up where they left off. David plays chess. Charlie plays mind games. Lurie (The Contender) elicits a terrific performance from Bosworth as Amy. Her meringue beauty belies a stony resolve. She is furious at David for his inability to stand up to the self-described rednecks who commit numerous trespasses and undress Amy with their eyes. Why dont you wear a bra? David asks. Amy believes she should be able to dress how she wants in her own house. In her anger Amy flashes the workmen an act interpreted by Charlie and coworkers as an invitation. In Peckinpahs version Amy (played by saucy Susan George) was - in the parlance of the day - ""asking for it."" Even worse in Peckinpahs notorious rape scene it seemed that Amy was responsive. Give Lurie this His rape scene does not like Peckinpahs aestheticize sexual violence. Amy does not prefer Charlies macho to her husbands meekness; she just wants David to stand up for himself the way she stands up for herself. Yet her rape is crudely intercut with a sequence of David hunting. David stalks and shoots a buck his rifle discharging at the same moment Charlie climaxes. I was horrified by the apparent cinematic equation of one man finding his manhood as another brutally exercises his. Perhaps Lurie meant to suggest that David was ""manning up"" and Charlie was a macho pig? In any event after that montage the film limps to its finale - an attack where together Amy and David defend their home and marriage. Even for an exploitation movie the second half of Straw Dogs feels awfully perfunctory. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215 854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Successful screenwriter David (James Marsden toothsome and dressed for Santa Barbara) takes his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) back to her small Louisiana hometown where he plans to work in peace on his Stalingrad script in the ancestral home which will eventually survive a siege. (Lurie goes over the films protect-your-turf themes with a highlighter.) David also hires Amys old flame Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) and his peckerwood pals to re-roof the barn. From this lofty perch already towering ex-quarterback Charlie begins a campaign of dick-measuring intimidation goading ""Hollywood"" David and coming on to Amy. Lurie sets up the animus between David and Charlie through visual and aural conflicts from an opening that puts pickup and Jaguar on a collision course to the ongoing workday feud between Classical and Classic Rock while macho motifs of buck hunting and Friday-night football are incorporated in wild cross-cutting pieces. Theres no matching the sinister village faces in Peckinpahs cast or the psychological acuity of his scene-making but Lurie shows himself man enough for the material.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If you havent seen the film that ""Straw Dogs"" is based on you might enjoy it as a competent home-invasion thriller. But if youre familiar with Sam Peckinpahs provocative controversy-courting 1971 original this remake resembles a capable Sunday painters Mona Lisa. Most details are in place but the technique and inspiration are missing. Director Rod Lurie puts scenes of violence before your eyes. Hurricane Sam drove the brutality into your brain and left you to wrestle with it. James Marsden steps into the role originated by Dustin Hoffman and all one can say is good luck with that. He plays David whose credentials for manhood are questioned when he settles in his wifes backwater hometown. Originally a timid mathematician and a foreigner in England David is reimagined as a metrosexual screenwriter who overcompensates by driving a classic Jaguar sports coupe. His wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) is the town beauty whose old attraction to her high school flame Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) still throws off the occasional spark. In a gesture both ingratiating and condescending David hires Charlie and his redneck pals to restore an old barn on Amys family farm. Tensions between the couple rise as the good ol boys begin a campaign of harassment. Amy pushes back David retreats and matters escalate to a hellish nighttime siege of the old stone farmhouse. The original films Darwinian struggle for male dominance here becomes a simplified red state/blue state culture clash with the repair crews Southern rock work tunes blaring against the Hollywood writers Beethoven. Lurie re-creates a rape scene from the original that ignited a firestorm of protest (it was the most angrily debated passage in Peckinpahs bloody career) but tiptoes away from the original films assertion that Amys no doesnt always mean no. Its a damaging change undermining a climactic scene where Amys loyalties should have been torn between her husband and her old lover. The greater problem however is Marsden a nice light comedian out of his depth in a role requiring powerhouse dramatic chops. Even speaking the same lines and going through the same motions his performance is a mere shadow of Hoffmans who showed us a meek mans sick thrill at discovering the beast within. By the finale Marsden just looks at the smoking chaos around him numbly having learned nothing. Nor have we.

Let the games begin. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Forty years ago Dustin Hoffman starred as David Sumner the wussy American mathematician who takes his young English wife Amy (Susan George) back to her native Cornwall farmhouse where an old flame Charlie Venner (Del Henney) comes sniffing around. Lurie ditches England for the Deep South. James Marsden plays David a wussy L.A. screenwriter who takes his TV-actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) back to her native farm where an old flame Charlie (True Bloods Alexander Skarsgard) comes sniffing around. On the surface the two films are startlingly similar. Amy is raped and David (unaware of the assault) is otherwise so humiliated as a man by Charlie and his buddies that he takes a brutal stand against their invasion. Peckinpah rubbed our noses in the bloodlust. Lurie invites objectivity. He gets strong complex performances from actors who wont be painted into corners. (Is the teasingly sexy Amy asking for trouble? Is Charlie capable of regret? Does David need to kill to be a man?) Lurie has David writing a script about Stalingrad the World War II battle in which the Soviets held on against Hitler but at crippling costs in suffering. Lurie wants us to see the moral wounds that come from losing control a solid reason for a remake. Both takes on Straw Dogs hold up a dark mirror to humanity. Choose your own bad medicine.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sam Peckinpahs 1971 provocation Straw Dogs takes place in an insular pocket of Cornwall where the locals view outsiders with a wariness ready to tip toward outright hostility at the slightest provocation. Its a town where egghead pacifist types learn quickly that violence sometimes provides the only answer and that letting women forget who wears the pants in a relationship is a mistake a man cant afford to make. Not a real man anyway. Forty years later this remake by Rod Lurie transplants the action to remotest Mississippi but the most notable change has nothing to do with location. To watch both films is to see a deeply repulsive view of the world as an unfailingly savage place expressed earnestly and executed chillingly then to see the same recycled as a rote revenge thriller attempting to shoulder more philosophical weight than it can bear. The would-be button-pusher behind The Contender and The Last Castle Lurie retains much of his source materials brutality but ends up defanging it through other means. James Marsden steps into the ineffectual dweeb role originated by Dustin Hoffman here reworked as a screenwriter hoping to finish a script about the siege of Stalingrad (foreshadowing) while he and his actress wife (Kate Bosworth) hole up in her late fathers country home. But trouble starts when Marsden hires a local contractor who also happens to be Bosworths high-school boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard) to repair a hurricane-damaged barn. Skarsgard and his crew eye Bosworth with lust looks she first unknowingly invites then purposefully courts after getting annoyed by Marsdens weenieish tendencies. They reserve a different sort of look for Marsden contempt for his less-than-hardened personality and big city Beethoven-listening ways. (And yes Lynyrd Skynyrd is on the soundtrack to provide contrast.) Also on hand James Woods who sounds a note of regional inauthenticity that rings through the whole film with his unconvincing accent-challenged portrayal of an aging good ol boy. The most striking moments in Luries Straw Dogs stay faithful to Peckinpahs original. Put another way the most striking moments lift whole shots and editing strategies from Peckinpahs original. Luries gift for mimicry ends up making the film feel even hollower than it might. Peckinpahs most controversial scene remains without its awful ambiguity and Lurie plays the finale for thrills where the original offered a nauseating descent into savagery. The original was repulsive but impossible to shake. This remake is pure applause bait which makes it barbaric in ways Peckinpah would never have dreamed.

"Movie Review ""Straw Dogs"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Senna"" Movie Review ""Drive"" - Movie Review ""Straw Dogs"" Posted on January 7 2013      by rogerinorlando Equal measures smug and savage Rod Luries infuriating remake of Sam Peckinpahs vengeance thriller ""Straw Dogs"" still packs a visceral punch. An exploitation picture built on redneck cliches and big city liberal outrage its not all bad. But it is a pretty unpleasant wallow in the obvious. Lurie whose career has become a careen (unreleased or under-released failures) since ""The Contender"" has cleverly re-set the tale that of a mild-mannered bookish and emasculated city dweller (Dustin Hoffman in the original James Marsden here) challenged bullied and battered by brutish primitive locals from England to Mississippi. In the small town where his hot-actress wife. Amy (Kate Bosworth) grew up God guns and goal posts are the measure of a man. Beer swilling and deer hunting in and out of season is the ""way of life."" David (Marsden) tips too generously drives a flashy vintage car whose tires he doesnt know how to change and rolls the cuffs of his dungarees up. He sings. He jumps rope. He prefers light beer. The locals see him and think ""pansy."" Or worse. Hiring a bunch of them including Amys high school beau (Alexander Skarsgard) to fix the roof on the barn on the family farm Amy inherited is just asking for trouble. She is way ahead of her screenwriter husband on this. Hes too over-awed by the staggering collection of William Faulkner/Tennessee Williams cliches that Lurie slaps in the script -- the simpleton with a history of taking sexual liberties from the local girls the drunken belligerent ex-coach (James Woods) who threatens one and all his harlot cheerleader daughter who flirts with the slow-witted guy (Dominic Purcell). These characters are all tolerated because ""we take care of our own"" as they say in all the old Southern movies and plays. All thats missing from Luries dated and limited research is Blanch Dubois  and ""the kindness of strangers."" All thats missing from the performances are the city slicker John Lennon glasses. Oh wait he gave those to David. David writing a script set at the Battle of Stalingrad listens to his Tchaikovsky and Beethoven as the redneck roofers blast out Molly Hatchet. They especially Charlie (Skarsgard) challenge him repeatedly. He bends over backwards trying to fit in go along to get along. And Amy loses another chunk of respect for him every time he lets some rube walk into their kitchen take a beer out of the fridge and grin about it. He is far too willing to buy into ""Thats the way we do things around here."" In the ""code"" of such tales we know David is asking for trouble. Hes gun-shy smaller than every man in town and yet still expecting to live by civilized big city rules. Amy knows better. Maybe shes seen the original film. Every time you give a bully an inch he takes a mile -- or liberties with your wife. The foreshadowing is comically obvious the petty insults and egregious outrages formulaic. And Amys ways of fighting back are risible pages from the Melodrama 101 textbook. Yeah take off your shirt (no bra) in front of them. Thatll showem. Marsden more at home in light comedies and musicals may have seemed like inspired casting. But we never believe hell stand up to these guys that hes even up to it. Luries resetting of the movie may seem dated to a real Southerner. But you dont have to dig into ancient history to find the redneck thuggery suggested here. Where the original film was a commentary on the endangered state of manhood in the late 20th  century Lurie seems to be making points about the ineffectual ways reasonable people face belligerent ignorance. Its intellectual liberals vs. Tea Party hicks with guns. Get it? One ""improvement"" stands out. Sam Peckinpah rather famously forgot to leave out the Chinese proverb that gave the original film its title. Lurie has David explain it in a moment that feels like a class recitation. It comes right after the  nightly chess lesson he gives his young/naive wife. Its not a terrible film but ""Straw Dogs"" this time around does push the wrong sorts of buttons. It veers from its social commentary into the trite and bloody with a finale that is unimaginative and rote. Lurie desperate to make something people will see has bloodied his hands and sullied his motives to make a movie that is as ugly as it is out of date. MPAA Rating R for strong brutal violence including a sexual attack menace some sexual content and pervasive language Cast Kate Bosworth James Marsden Alexander Skarsgard James Woods. Credits Written and directed by Rod Lurie based on the Sam Peckinpah film and the novel ""The Siege of Trenchers Farm"" by Gordon Williams. A Screen Gems release.

"Straw Dogs | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Straw Dogs Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 13 2011 | 0700AM PT Though competently crafted Rod Luries wholly unnecessary 2011 remake is a film with few notions of its own. Though perhaps more studied than loved Sam Peckinpahs 1971 ""Straw Dogs"" was both a product of its tumultuous time and a film filled with provocative ideas however upsetting and anachronistic those ideas may now seem. Though competently crafted Rod Luries wholly unnecessary 2011 remake is a film with few notions of its own and representative of its time only in the commercial sense that home-invasion thrillers are now more prevalent at the multiplex. Auds unfamiliar with the original may be lured by the pics marketing as a standard-issue actioner; their expectations are likely to be frustrated without ever being challenged. Purportedly deriving as much inspiration from Gordon Williams source novel as from Peckinpahs film this remake hews to the overall developments of the original film extremely faithfully. The most obvious changes are largely cosmetic -- Corwall England is replaced by Blackwater Mississippi; bagpipe music is replaced with zydeco; the order and manner of deaths in the final sequence is shuffled around somewhat; and nebbishy protag David (James Marsden) has gone from math professor to Hollywood scribe composing a screenplay about the siege of Stalingrad. (Lurie may have intended this as a sly rebuke to critic Pauline Kael who famously called the original ""a fascist work of art"" but without that metatextual reference point it simply reads as foreshadowing applied with a trowel.) None of these changes proves particularly detrimental. What is detrimental however are the more subtle modifications which sand down the rougher edges of the original. The protagonists have become more likable and empowered motivations have become more cut and dried and references to underlying political schisms are downplayed. This may make things more philosophically palatable to contemporary auds but ""Straw Dogs"" isnt a film that was ever meant to be palatable. Absent Bloody Sams provocations and inimitable style the film becomes merely an abrasive potboiler still viscerally unpleasant but no longer meaningfully so. Marsden is given a thankless task replacing Dustin Hoffman in the lead role and though he only skims the depth Hoffman brought to the part he puts in a credible performance all the same. Arriving in deep Dixie in his vintage Jaguar with actress wife and Blackwater native Amy (Kate Bosworth) at his side he hopes to spend some time writing at Amys empty ancestral home. Yet boasting a Hollywood-by-Hyannis Port fashion sense and a goofy if prickly demeanor David is rather ill suited for life in the rural South. Playing the same fish-out-of-water themes in the original pic its not long before David runs afoul of the natives in the local pub by trying to buy beer with a debit card and turning down the fried pickles. Most irked by the interlopers arrival is Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) an outwardly polite good-ol-boy and Amys high school paramour. In a condescendingly friendly gesture David hires Charlie and his gang of chuckleheaded cretins to repair a barn damaged by Hurricane Katrina which they do in increasingly short shifts while blasting Southern rock and getting a bit too comfortable on Davids property. Lingering sparks between Charlie and Amy are bubbling under all the while and the yee-haws openly ogle her as she jogs braless around the property. Meanwhile the towns resident alcoholic and former football coach Tom Hedden (James Woods) suspects a mentally challenged man with a shadowy past (Dominic Purcell) of getting too intimate with his flirtatious 15-year-old daughter (Willa Holland). To his credit Lurie is in no rush to bring these tensions to a head but he never manages to lead them credibly from quiet unease to the extreme brutality that follows. Davids inaction in the face of increasingly serious thuggery is more reminiscent of ""The Big Lebowski"" than ""Hamlet"" and while hes clearly uncomfortable in these new surroundings he never seems as essentially foreign a presence as Hoffmans ivory-tower Yank did in Cornwall. Lurie also never bothers to broach the red state/blue state divide that seems like fertile ground. The climactic violence while filling entire frames with blood will certainly not cause as much of a stir as its 70s counterpart did. (One character even references the ""Saw"" franchise underscoring how permissive the standards of onscreen carnage have become in the last four decades.) This films version of Amys rape a sequence in the original still fiercely debated by cineastes and feminists remains immensely uncomfortable despite the dicey gender politics of the original having been excised. Yet the new variation it introduces which compromises the narrative consistency of Skarsgards Charlie makes little sense. Nonetheless Skarsgard remains the films standout performer limning the only character to have been significantly deepened from the original. The hulking Swede nails his Southern accent without overdoing it and his performance implies a depth and internal logic to Charlies actions that the film doesnt necessarily grasp. To a lesser degree thats true of everyone here. Being a modern couple David and Amy discuss their marital troubles openly though they rarely advance beyond couples therapy lingo. David explains the Taoist parable from which the film takes its title excusing redneck resentment as a residue of failed football careers -- a bit of audience hand-holding the film shouldnt need. In these cases Lurie has introduced a brew of additional motivations to characters who could have been simple archetypes but in fleshing them out he only spotlights the narrative inconsistencies in their decisions. The films tech specs are professional if sometimes workmanlike and lenser Alik Sakharov does well to capture the humid browns and oranges of the Louisiana filming location. A badly CGIed deer sparked some guffaws in the screening attended but the stuntwork and editing in the final battle is solid. Larry Groupes score can sometimes come on a bit strong though his primary mode of softly drifting swells of strings undercut by creepy dissonance is smart.

Daily Edition Login to download Straw Dogs Film Review 1014 AM PDT 9/13/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Remake of Sam Peckinpahs controversial original retains the sensational violence but loses character depth and ambiguity. TWITTER James Marsden Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard star in director Rod Luries redo of Sam Peckinpahs 1971 original. Taken on its own terms as a nasty tale of how a bunch of rough rednecks pester and brutalize a nice city couple until the latter summon up the grit to turn the tables on them Straw Dogs amounts to a raw slab of red meat to tempt and probably satisfy the hoi polloi. But to anyone whos seen Sam Peckinpahs provocative and unsettling 1971 original Rod Luries redo adds nothing and subtracts nuance and ambiguity from what was one of the more controversial films of an already tumultuous period. Screen Gems should be able to exploit the storys violence and inherent blood-boiling elements to good immediate returns in wide release. Moving the action from the West of England to Americas Deep South instantly produces the sought-after hotbed of conflict for a good-looking Hollywood screenwriter and his sexy blond actress wife when they roll into the aptly named Blackwater Miss. in their cherry silver 67 Jaguar XKE to take up extended residence while he writes a script about the siege of Stalingrad. The writer David (James Marsden) does wonders for his status with the local good ol boys by showing up at the local bar wearing a Harvard lacrosse t-shirt while Amy (Kate Bosworth) who was born and bred in these parts is instantly hit on by rangy former flame Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard) ringleader of the town yahoos who doesnt consider her married status as an excuse not to pick up where they left off years ago. Aside from the changes in settings and professions (Dustin Hoffman played a mathematician in the original while Susan Georges wife was well a wife) Lurie has deviated little from the script by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinipah itself based on a novel by Gordon Williams. Fundamentally its a study of how far passivism can be pushed a collision between an aggressive force and a more pliant one that can be roused to a defense only when survival is genuinely threatened. Especially because the central motivating incident is the rape of the wife this is a story designed to stoke fires and awaken basic instincts in both the characters and the audience. But whereas Peckinpah managed not only to raise hackles but to get under the skin Lurie manages only the former which reduces the material to the level of sensation-mongering. Settling into a lovely riverside farmhouse belonging to Amys family the affable David tries to get down to work while Amy takes a break from her TV career which makes her the envy of her old local girlfriends. Providing a major distraction however is the daily presence of Charlie and his boys hired to fix up the dilapidated barn on the property. Chummy on the surface and mock-respectfully addressing David as ""sir"" Charlie and his crew nonetheless play their little games to test the limits blasting loud music entering the house for beer whenever they feel like knocking off early hanging a pet cat in a closet and leering at Amy when she jogs around in scanties. When her husband warns her about the effect her appearance has on the horndogs she reprovingly asks ""Are you saying Im asking for this?"" Peckinpahs film devoted a good deal more time to domestic scenes between the husband and wife revealing ways in which they were not quite in synch and certain dissatisfactions on her part nothing overtly spelled out but enough to quietly suggest she might have reason to recall her old boyfriend from time to time. This feeds into her reactions when her former beau rapes her a sequence that set off a furor at the time for its intimations not that she asked for it but that once it was happening she was not altogether unresponsive. Theres little such ambiguity this time around when Charlie comes calling after the boys have deliberately lured David out on a hunting expedition to put his manhood to the test. ""Youre a coward"" Amy accuses her husband in the aftermath. ""No Im not"" he replies before having to prove it by defending their house against an armed nocturnal assault by the liquored-up mob joined now by the hot-headed local football coach (James Woods) whose wayward teenage daughter has been assaulted by the village idiot the couple is protecting. Lurie has recycled the most memorably gruesome details of Peckinpahs staging of the domestic battle-to-the-death including the shotgun blast to the foot and the fearsome bear trap. But while the visceral impact of the improvised combat remains and will have the intended effect on viewers most of whom will not have seen the original the way the action has been rushed and amplified makes it seem less realistic goosed up in an artificial movie way. The coachs contribution to the melee particularly as concerns his intervention with the local sheriff (practically the only black character on view) is especially unconvincing. All told Lurie tries way too hard to outdo Peckinpah with his siege and not surprisingly falls way short. Marsden is entirely affable as a well-intentioned guy whose wife has perhaps not given him fair warning for what he may be in for on her home turf. For the film to have had any dimension other than as a home invasion shocker however Bosworths Kate would have needed layers of subtext; until she questions his bravery theres no indication she finds him anything less than a good guy and husband and there are no questions raised about the state of their marriage any lingering feelings she might have for Charlie and so forth. The central relationship has no depth and Bosworth comes off as rather hard certainly compared to Susan George in the original who was wonderfully changeable of mood and temperature; indeed she was the heart of the film notwithstanding Hoffmans admirable summoning of hitherto untested courage. Towering over his costars TV hearththrob Skarsgard makes for a formidable antagonist while Woods has no trouble conjuring up the small towns reigning whackjob. Louisiana locations are suitably atmospheric although the mismatching of fog and clear skies during Davids disorienting hunting expedition is sloppy in the extreme.
