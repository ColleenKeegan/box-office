When Sheikh Riyadh (Sharif) gets wind of Hopkins endurance credentials and asks him to compete in an epic race across the Arabian desert the half-cut hybrid horseman figures hes got nothing to lose and heads for the dunes with his favourite hoss Hidalgo. The Western goes East. Director Johnston reigns in any easy jingoism to focus on fate breeding CGI leopards and enough horseflesh to make a Frenchman drool. Accept a chewy script that erases any subtlety at every tangled turn and youre left with a passable if overlong sand n spurs epic that boasts a couple of decent set pieces and the sort of alluring landscape photography that helped earn the Western its place in cinematic legend. Disney marketed the film as a true story despite much evidence that the real-life Hopkins was a hoaxer of the highest order. Aristocratic love interest Lombard has the right idea along for the ride with a look of detached amusement that says it all boys will be boys.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Hidalgo Saddle Up washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Hidalgo Saddle Up Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 5 2004 A LITTLE BIT of Viggo goes a long way. Thats both a synopsis and a critique of ""Hidalgo"" a serviceable yet formulaic horse-race flick starring Viggo Mortensen as real-life late-19th-century Pony Express rider Frank Hopkins. Along with his trusty mustang Hidalgo Hopkins -- or so it has been said for much about the mans life is in dispute -- competed against a field of cutthroat Arab riders not to mention the elements in a grueling 3000-mile race across the Saudi Arabian desert known as the Ocean of Fire. Capitalizing on Mortensens heroic larger-than-life appeal thanks mainly to a little trilogy called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the film plays out like a brisk if bumpy Old Hollywood-style epic. Following the action which proceeds at a gallop despite such obstacles as a dust storm brigands wild cats locusts the threat of castration and dehydration a detour to rescue a kidnapped princess and general underhandedness its easy for a viewer to forget that the movie isnt really about anything other than the ride itself. The ever-workmanlike Joe ""October Sky"" Johnstons propulsive if predictable direction and Mortensens crinkly battered nobility are almost diverting enough in and of themselves. Unfortunately screenwriter John Fusco has seen fit to dress up the story with some overly familiar ""Dances With Wolves""-style nonsense about how the part-Indian Hopkins -- a jaded drunk we are led to believe since witnessing the massacre at Wounded Knee -- is a lost man in need of finding. At heart ""Hidalgo"" is an underdog drama like one of a hundred others. Is there ever any serious question that Hopkins and his mixed-breed horse -- the first considered an infidel by his Islamic opponents the other a mutt unworthy to run against thoroughbreds -- will redeem themselves in the end mustering the can-do American spirit that made this mongrel nation great? Of course not. In movies like this though its never the outcome thats up in the air but the route that our heroes must take to get to the finish line. Did anyone ever doubt that Batman would be able to find something in his utility belt to escape his latest televised predicament (a can of shark-repellant Batspray perhaps)? By the same token just when things look direst for Hopkins as when hes about to shoot his limp and almost lifeless steed in the head after a debilitating fall something quasi-miraculous occurs to carry our protagonists -- both the two- and the four-legged variety -- forward. Sure it sounds and likely is far more implausible than the actual race (if such a race ever took place) really was. And such anachronistic touches as the hard-to-swallow feminism of Hopkinss almost-love interest (Zuleikha Robinson) the feisty daughter of an overprotective sheik (Omar Sharif) are historically suspect. But Ill be gosh-darned if the sound of the wind in Mortensens dyed-red locks as he races across the sand and that squint of determination in his dust-caked gray-green eyes arent just diverting enough to turn ""Hidalgo"" into one rousing if rote adventure.

Unfortunately it is limited by one-dimensional even stereotypical characters and a predictable and drawn-out plot. At 130 minutes it is about 40 minutes too long. (Related video Watch the Hidalgo trailer) No stranger to horsebacking Viggo Mortensen saddles up for a race across Saudi Arabia. Buena Vista Pictures Hidalgo is the name of a powerful and beautiful mustang ridden by Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) a courier who gained fame for winning long-distance horse races and starring in Buffalo Bills famous stunt shows. He also is half Indian and while delivering a message he witnesses the massacre at Wounded Knee. Deeply depressed he turns to booze and bruising stunts to numb his torment. So its no surprise when he accepts an offer to compete with Hidalgo in a sprawling race across the Saudi Arabian desert. The arduous competition carries with it a huge prize but that is almost beside the point for the honorable Hopkins. As the first non-Arab to compete in the race his way is paved with antipathy and efforts to derail him. Still he perseveres. Mortensen indelibly etched in most moviegoers minds as the valiant Aragorn from TheLord of the Rings trilogy looks the part of the rugged cowboy and has particularly expressively eyes which he puts to good use. But he lacks the range as an actor to effectively portray this damaged hero. Hidalgo also is hampered by the almost cartoonish portrayals of villainous Middle Easterners and a controlling beautiful English woman (Louise Lombard) who tries to steer Hopkins off course. Among the supporting cast only Omar Sharif stands out for his nuanced and warm performance as an Arabian sheik who loves Buffalo Bill comic books. In less capable hands his part could have come off as a kind of buffoon. There is some lovely cinematography by Shelly Johnson in the classic David Lean style and plenty of excitement. Taken just for that Hidalgo delivers.

Simmons. Directed by Joe Johnston from a screenplay by John Fusco. 133 minutes. Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and some mild innuendo. Several theaters. How you feel about the adventure/horse-race movie ""Hidalgo"" has a lot to do with how you feel about gazing at Viggo Mortensen for more than two hours. (Well most of the time the camera gazes at Mortensen though occasionally were given a nice close-up of a horse.) Mortensens an unlikely matinee idol; though hes devilishly handsome (he looks like a rough-hewn Jude Law) theres a laid-back unruffled quality to him that well suits the cowboy character he plays here. Some may find him a little too laconic; others may simply enjoy the scenery. And theres scenery aplenty here far beyond Viggos manly visage. ""Hidalgo"" set in the late days of the 19th century begins in the American West and travels to Arabia with plenty of sweeping plains and endless skylines along the way. Mortensen plays Frank T. Hopkins a disgruntled outcast haunted by the battle at Wounded Knee. Like Tom Cruise in the beginning of ""The Last Samurai"" hes halfheartedly touring in a Wild West show connecting only with his beloved horse Hidalgo. When the pair are given the opportunity to travel overseas to enter the Ocean of Fire (a 3000-mile survival race across the Arabian Desert) Hopkins hesitates but only momentarily. Soon hes riding the horse up the gangplank of a ship where the elegant Lady Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard) owner of a rival horse coolly eyes him with something more than professional interest. And in Arabia more woman troubles emerge He finds friendship with Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson) daughter of the powerful Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) and a horsewoman who wants to ride where females are forbidden. Its a fairly routine adventure story which may well have little basis in fact. (Many Web sites have disputed the events portrayed in ""Hidalgo""; not being a historian I can only note the controversy and move on.) But whether its true or not has little to do with whether it works as a movie and overall it does thanks to Mortensens slightly hesitant charm (Hopkins is a bit out of his depth here and he knows it) and some dazzling visual work from director of photography Shelley Johnson. See ""Hidalgo"" on a big screen and youll be rewarded by vistas of horses their hooves pounding against snow-hardened ground on some American plain; by some undeniably cool sandstorms (yes you can tell its CGI but its far better than those in ""The Mummy""); by a shot of a leopard racing toward the camera that just might take your breath away. All this makes it possible to forgive the films problems its excessive length and sometimes awkward pacing its cartoony scene of a near-castration its easy (though not hammered) West-triumphs-over-East message. ""Hidalgo"" too often seems to doze off leaving the viewer with little to do but count Lady Annes seemingly endless collection of stylish desert veils (one alas looks like it has worms crawling all over it). But when its awake it offers plenty of diversion as Mortensen shows a new side of his persona here the noble cowboy squinting in the sun.

Starring Viggo Mortensen Omar Sharif and Louise Lombard. Directed by Joe Johnston. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its not as if we havent seen movies like ""Hidalgo"" before -- the cowboy the horse the hat -- and yet theres something fresh about it all the same. Part of it comes from Viggo Mortensen an actor who has the measured pace and steady gaze of a Cooper or a Stewart. Mainly the freshness comes from the apparently sincere commitment of the screenwriter John Fusco and the director Joe Johnston to a vision of the American hero that however dated still carries an emotional impact. Loosely based on the life of Frank T. Hopkins a former cowboy who entered many long-distance horse races ""Hidalgo"" gives us this iconic American He talks when he has to. He helps out when possible. Hes open to new ideas. He lives and lets live. He believes its possible to do things. And he is in touch with nature. Even his horse likes him. His horse likes him a lot. Its a long movie too long in fact though the cuts should have all come from the beginning. After a slow start it moves. Mortensen plays Frank half Indian by blood who rides a brown and white mustang named Hidalgo. Early in the film Frank witnesses the massacre at Wounded Knee and this turns him into a drunk doing tricks for Buffalo Bills Wild West Show. The Buffalo Bill show has been evoked in other films but rarely in a way so mercenary and depressing as a place where soothing myths were sold to the public by precisely the people who knew better. Related Stories Horseman finds himself in desert / Hidalgo burnishes old themes to create intriguing new hero ""Hidalgo"" has similarities to ""The Last Samurai"" in which Tom Cruise also becomes a drunk after witnessing the massacre of an American Indian village but Cruise more flamboyant by nature becomes a bigger drunk and gets into bigger trouble. By contrast Mortensen plays Frank as saddened by what he sees but more disgusted than surprised. Lost in his own country he decides to go away to find himself. He accepts an offer to go to the Middle East and enter a race across the Iraqi desert to Damascus competing against the greatest horsemen and horses in Arabia. The films frequent mention of Iraq and Syria in a film set a century ago could make one wonder if ""Hidalgo"" is intended as some kind of allegory but the story is straightforward concentrating not on the merits of any particular culture but on the physical and internal struggles of a single individual. America in 1890 is messy and Frank finds the Middle East just as messy full of conflicts and rivalries. Omar Sharif plays the Sheikh of Sheikhs and one can only imagine how thrilled the filmmakers must have been to cast him. Who better to play the Sheikh of Sheikhs? Hes a man of honor and a loving indulgent father who nonetheless treats his daughter (Zuleikha Robinson) like a dishrag when men are around and who plans on marrying her off as the fourth wife of a bad guy. What Sharif brings to the role is a complete understanding of how such a man - - contradictory by Western standards -- could make perfect sense in a Middle Eastern context. Thus we understand too the unyielding influence of tradition in the Sheikhs every decision. The journey through the desert comes complete with two bizarre natural occurrences -- an obviously computer-generated sandstorm and a less obviously canned sky-blackening swarm of locusts. Will someday computer- generated sequences seem as laughably fake to most people as old-fashioned rear projection does today? Its inevitable. These obligatory action touches as well as the failure of the film to make completely clear which rider is on which horse and who has a financial stake in whom are about the worst that can be said for ""Hidalgo."" The good things are many Sharifs playfulness and dignity. The cool complicated villainy of Louise Lombard as the amoral Lady Davenport who wants her horse to win at any cost. And Mortensen who says little but sees all and seems to understand all from a place not of judgment but of tolerance. Over the course of the film every kind of treachery is thrown at Frank -- not to mention knives and spears -- and he just deals with it neither outraged nor frightened. If this kind of American hero no longer exists -- especially if he no longer exists -- hes a nourishing vision all the same. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

Hidalgo Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hidalgo-2004,200,hidalgo11,hidalgo,rogerebert
"Led by a lackluster star Hidalgo doesnt have enough horsepower - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Led by a lackluster star Hidalgo doesnt have enough horsepower By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 5 2004 Like most movies about men and horses ""Hidalgo"" spares no expense in matters of corniness. Set in the 1890s its sort of a throwback movie executed with the boyish kick of dusty old cowboy matinees. ""Sort of"" because the movie makes an admirable attempt to create non-American characters that function independently of the movies hero one Frank T. Hopkins.In his first star vehicle since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy Viggo Mortensen plays Hopkins. The actor is such a vigorous horseman that his use of a stunt double might never cross your mind. But his performance is wooden enough to make you think hed been cast as a lumberjack.The driving action in ""Hidalgo"" is a 3000-mile race across the Arabian Desert but the movie which is based on Hopkinss tall tale of a life strives to be a lot more. For starters Hopkins is halfSioux but hes been passing for a white guy and the Indian lives he took at Wounded Knee have left him with a mean identity hangover.In the years that follow he and his spotted mustang Hidalgo join Buffalo Bills traveling rodeo show which also features Bill Cody (J.K. Simmons) and Annie Oakley (Elizabeth Berridge). In their hair and garish makeup they look like clowns whove come down with consumption. But Hopkins falling off Hidalgo in drunken oblivion is still the crowd favorite.Annoyed that Hopkins is brandishing Hidalgo as the worlds best endurance horse Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) wants the horseman to put up or shut up more or less and pay the fee to enter the Great Horse Race of the Bedouin. If he beats the sheiks unbeatable Al-Hattal there is glory (for no non-Arab has ever entered) and a huge cash prize.Hopkins consults with his mentor Chief Eagle Horn (Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman) about whether to take the dare but hes there before you can say ""Sandbiscuit."" Yet theres so much off-course action along the way to the climactic race that crossing the finish line seems like an afterthought.In prolonged pit stops John Fuscos screenplay heats up a broth of Arabian intrigue. Should Al-Hattal win the race the sheik will give his daughter Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson) to his stallions royal jockey Prince Bin Al Reeh (Said Taghmaoui) who already has four other wives. Jazira meanwhile is tired of hiding her face from men. Shes tired of being told she cant ride her beloved Al-Hattal because shes a girl. In other words shes a script revision away from ""International Velvet.""When Jazira is kidnapped (yes theres more plot) the sheik turns to Hopkins to rescue her. And its here that the movie gets full of itself having Mortensen lay down some ""Western justice."" Still this side story does produce some nice old-Western daytime photography by Shelly Johnson.Fusco also wrote both ""Young Guns"" movies and the dreary equine fable ""Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron."" ""Hidalgo"" often feels like a rigged collision of the two. Sometimes its zesty sometimes its a draggy bore. The workhorse director Joe Johnston who made limited boys-eye-view fantasies ""The Rocketeer"" and ""Jurassic Park III"" brings to ""Hidalgo"" the same B-movie showmanship. The desert here is vast and he does an adequate job of filling it with computer-enhanced natural disasters and natural wonders. None of the latter include the flat characters.The Arabs though come off reasonably well -- for a big-budget Hollywood production. Much subtitled Arabic is spoken. The word ""brigand"" is even casually used. And for every cowardly turncoat and heartless killer we get a more fleshed-out archetype.It is nice however to see the spry and achingly handsome Sharif ruling the desert so many years after ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The ""Lord of the Rings"" movies meanwhile have done loads for Mortensens charisma yet zilch for his range. Still a pupil at the Harrison Ford modeling agency his ugly-pretty face tops out at two expressions sorrow and surprise. Hes an underwhelming movie star but an ideal fellow to run into at a dude ranch. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Hopkins a real-life horseman once billed as the greatest distance rider...2004-03-03Zuleikha RobinsonOmar SharifJ.K. SimmonsZuleikha Robinson Omar Sharif J.K. SimmonsTouchstone Pictures Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C+ Hidalgo Genre Drama; Starring Viggo Mortensen Zuleikha Robinson Omar Sharif J.K. Simmons; Director Joe Johnston; Author John Fusco; Release Date Wide 03/05/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 136; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Touchstone Pictures Posted March 3 2004 -- 1200 AM EST In the period action-adventure Hidalgo Viggo Mortensen plays Frank T. Hopkins a real-life horseman once billed as the ""greatest distance rider the West has ever known."" Fame enough you whinny? Neigh. This fictionalized Hopkins is a variation on Tom Cruises Last Samurai - a broken American who having faced moments of death and despair finds redemption on exotically foreign soil. A sorrel-and-white mustang plays the title role of Hopkins beloved steed now turned into a variation on Seabiscuit - an unprepossessing-looking homegrown horse with spirit enough to outrun even the fanciest world-class purebreds in a big-wager 3000-mile race across the desert sands. And 19th-century Arabia - reproduced in Morocco - represents the Fox News Channel version of modern Muslim geography Its populated with wily rulers devoted to mysterious rituals shifty princes untrustworthy aides who refer all decisions to Allah a sheikhs young daughter chafing for freedom and throngs of local residents who first jeer at the strange U.S. cowboy when he comes to challenge their Arabian purebreds then come to cheer him when he prevails. Thats a lot for one horse tale to handle and ""Hidalgo"" cant reign it all in. So this not-so-ripping yarn about Western will triumphing over what Allah decrees directed with love for scale and location by Joe Johnston (""October Sky"") and written with too much love of man-to-horse chat by John Fusco (""Young Guns"") never quite settles into its paces. Simplest of its charms is the opportunity to watch Mortensen adapt his charismatic demeanor of wary taciturn soulfulness from that of a Middle-earth king-in-waiting to one fitting a half-Lakota horseman in 1890 a loner who saves most of his conversation for his horse and the rest for brief words with his Native American brethren. (Mortensen can now list a proficiency in Elvish and Sioux on his resume.) There is too the delight of luxuriating in Omar Sharifs royal personification of Arab pride as a cultured potentate. And its always thrilling to watch an old-fashioned movie set among the awesome Moroccan dunes during which Hopkins drawls to a hotheaded competitor ""Nobody hurts mah horse."" But all those churlish villainous Arabs begin to blur into Team Bad Guy calling Hopkins fightin names like ""an impure unbeliever."" The sheikhs feminist daughter (Zuleikha Robinson) a Mulan of Arabia is a sop to modern audiences and her girl power is canceled out at any rate by the horse-owning rich-twit Englishwoman (Louise Lombard) set up as a colonial Cruella. And repeatedly there are unnerving close-up-on-the-eyeball reaction shots of Hidalgo himself. These are meant no doubt to convey the animals extraordinary empathetic understanding of the rider who calls him ""brother."" But that eye could just as well be telegraphing ""More oats please"" of which ""Hidalgo"" is full.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hidalgo ) Hidalgo (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Disneys Hidalgo about a late 19th century long distance horse race across the Arabian Desert is a sporadically entertaining adventure movie that is hampered by poor pacing a badly focused screenplay and cheesy special effects. Seabiscuit this isnt. It would be unfair to completely dismiss Hidalgo because in spite of its flaws - some of which are painfully evident - it nevertheless retains the capacity to engross and inspire. And it would be impossible to discuss this movie without examining a burgeoning controversy which is sure to dog Hidalgo from theater screens to video store shelves. The film purports (more later on my wording choice) to tell the true-life tale of ""legendary"" long-distance endurance rider Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) and his favorite Spanish mustang Hidalgo. In 1890 at the invitation of an Arabian sheik (Omar Sharif) Hopkins travels across the ocean to enter a 3000-mile race across the Arabian Desert from Aden to Syria. Hidalgos competition is comprised of 100 desert-bred horses most of which appear far better conditioned than the American animal to win under such adverse arid conditions. Along the way Hopkins and Hidalgo must weather sandstorms and confront Bedouin raiders all while scouring the inhospitable terrain for food and water. Thrown into the mix are two beautiful women a young attractive girl named Jazira (Zuleikha Robinson) who is trying to prove herself to her powerful father and the dangerous Lady Anne Davenport (Louise Lombard) whose plans are less obvious than her greedy motives. As a straightforward telling of the race Hidalgo might have made for a strongly entertaining motion picture. Unfortunately director Joe Johnston working from a screenplay by John Fusco elects to interrupt the story with a 25-minute episode featuring Jaziras rescue from a group of bandits. Not only does this break the races momentum but it pads out the films protracted running length. With the exception of some sub-par special effects (a sandstorm and a shot of a ship passing the Statue of Liberty both appear obviously computer generated) and a bizarre instance of mystical intervention in the desert Johnston keeps us involved in the race. But where a tighter Hidalgo would have been gripping this version is long enough to threaten overstaying its welcome. In his first post-Aragorn outing Viggo Mortensen is more wooden than the post round which he ties his horse. Mortensen plays the brooding cowboy clichA(c) with such somber conviction that he borders on self-parody. Hopkins isnt a character; hes a caricature. His horse often seems more ""real."" While its pleasant to see Omar Sharif once more on screens (he can also be seen in Monsieur Ibrahim which marked his exit from semi-retirement) this part is nearly as big a waste of his talent as the one in The 13th Warrior. (The rescue sequence appears partly engineered to beef up his screen time.) Malcolm McDowell has a delicious cameo that made me wish he could have stayed around longer. The plum role belongs to Louise Lombard who devours it with the relish of a black widow. Now the controversy. Disney is advertising Hidalgo as being ""based on a true story."" (What is the obsession with movies to trumpet even the most tenuous connection to real-life events?) Indeed the writings of Frank Hopkins tell the story of Hidalgos amazing triumph in this 3000-mile race. However most reliable historians have dismissed Hopkins writings as anything from an outright fabrication to a highly exaggerated tall tale. In fact no credible accounts (either written or oral) can be found to substantiate that any long-distance races were begun from Aden or that Hopkins was anything more than an imaginative writer. In short although the movies script may be loosely based on Hopkins so-called memoirs it doesnt take much investigation to determine that those writings are not accounts of real events. The historical basis of a movie is largely irrelevant to whether its good or bad entertaining or not. But theres something disturbing about Disneys insistence of marketing Hidalgo as being based on a true story when theres as much honesty here as in Richard Nixons ""I am not a crook"" statement. Stripped of that simple marketing tagline Hidalgo and Disney would be controversy-free in this instance but the determination of the marketing department not to come clean places another stain on the Magic Kingdoms already splotchy complexion. The Internet Movie Databases message boards for the movie quote Nina Heyn Disneys Executive Director of International Publicity as having made the following comment in the May 13 2003 edition of The Saudi Gazette ""No one [at Disney] really cares about the historical aspectsa| If it transpires that the historical aspects are in question I dont think people would care that much. Hidalgo is a family film. It has little to do with reality."" Yes Hidalgo is a family film (albeit a mediocre one) and it deserves to be seen for what it is not as the centerpiece of a controversy that has resulted from Disneys dishonesty.
