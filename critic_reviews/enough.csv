Average pic seems unlikely to advance actor-thrush Jennifer Lopezs assault on the b.o. and music charts. The latest model in the recent spate of underwhelming female star vehicles ""Enough"" a thriller detailing how a good wife gets back at an evil possessive husband is never provocative enough to generate strong emotional response. Utterly average pic seems unlikely to advance actor-thrush Jennifer Lopezs simultaneous assault on the box office and music charts. Though it will attract a core young-adult female-heavy aud as well as those yearning for a rehash of Julia Roberts starrer ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" and will definitely strike deep chords with women who have endured shoddy (or worse) marriages and relationships drama doesnt set off sufficient fireworks to create word-of-mouth for durable early summer returns. More notable than Lopezs transformation from dutiful wife to martial arts expert is the work of Michael Apted who keeps pushing the known limits of directorial versatility. With both intriguing docus (the ""Up"" series ""Me and Isaac Newton"") and Bond pics (""The World Is Not Enough"") under his belt Apted is able to swing between this workmanlike but always attractive Hollywood star vehicle and the elegant and thoroughly involving WWII drama ""Enigma."" Storyline here care of screenwriter Nicholas Kazan is divided into several titled sections beginning with ""Hey"" a mini-intro of the close friendship of L.A. diner waitress colleagues Slim (Lopez) and Ginny (Juliette Lewis) followed by ""How They Met"" showing the friction-filled encounter between Mitch (Billy Campbell) and Slim with diner customer Robbie (Noah Wyle) caught somewhere in between. In less than 10 minutes running time Slim and Mitch are married capped by his weighty vow ""Youre safe with me Slim."" Kazan inserts further strained foreshadowing in a scene where Mitch a wealthy developer impulsively places an offer on a home adding the unlikely but revealing comment to the seller ""Just think how miserable a crazy person can make you."" No sooner than you can say plot point Slim finds out just how miserable Mitch can make her when a few years after they have a little girl Gracie (Tessa Allen) she finds out hes been cheating on her. Mitch might get points for admitting his transgressions but when his message is essentially ""Leave and Ill kill you"" its clear this movie is hidebound to play out everything in black and white. An especially dumb ruse to get away from Mitch only makes matters worse but Slim and Gracie finally go on the run. Ensuing hour consists of a transnational pursuit with Slim hiding out in various states with the help of Ginny old beau Joe (Dan Futterman) her adopted parent (Christopher Maher) and most contrived of all a cocky high-tech magnate named Jupiter (Fred Ward) who Slim insists is her birth father. Mitchs pursuit of her includes the banal (an obvious cadre of thugs who show up at Joes Seattle pad) and a clever twist involving the suddenly reappearing Robbie who asks the question on everyones mind at this point -- why Mitch doesnt just give up the chase; the lame answer only exposes the movies spindly foundation. Apted directs efficiently trying to look past the scripts legion of problems and stages moments of genuine suspense. But he cant help being part of a ruthless storytelling machine designed to get Slim to the point where she must temporarily hand Gracie over to Ginny and go into seclusion enduring a month of basic training (funded by deep-pocketed Jupiter) with a master of Krav Maga an Israeli form of martial arts in order to confront and kill Mitch in his L.A. home -- cold concrete and ultra-mod suiting every Hollywood villain these days. Final fight is as preordained as it is perfunctory and closes things out on a dissipated note. Never completely convincing in the role Lopez seems as dominated by Campbell as Slim is -- for most of the tale -- by Mitch. Both Campbell and Wyle are playing against their good-guy TV types and carry things as far as their underwritten characters allow. One hopes this doesnt portend a series of ""best friend"" parts for Lewis who deserves better. Ward as he habitually does turns a slim role into a far more complex portrait. Consummately slick production is graced by Rogier Stoffers pro widescreen lensing and an expansive set of locations that pushes the entire project beyond the boundaries of domestic drama.

Odd then (though strangely familiar) that she falls for the charmer in the corner and that theyre off down the aisle in a heartbeat. Soon she has a daughter to think of and her husband has morphed into a controlling psychotic. Now she must either stick it out like in some goddam Country and Western song or take the kid and leave. But can she ever fully escape such a persistent abuser and start to fight back? In the end the problem is not so much that its now impossible to imagine Lopez outside her star persona its more that she completely fails to pull off scenes requiring any depth.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

At best this should have been a bad made-for-TV movie. Youll find yourself begging for a commercial break time and again. Jennifer Lopez is a beautiful multi-talented woman. And yes she can act. But this inane drivel is mind-numbingly bad. Watching this film is like driving across a prairie in second gear -- slow and boring. This paint-by-numbers revenge flick begins with a hardworking diner waitress nicknamed Slim (Lopez) getting hit on by a low-life jerk played by Noah Wyle. Then out of the blue comes Mitch (Billy Campbell) who saves her -- then marries her. We also meet Slims best friend fellow waitress Ginny (Juliette Lewis) and her loving boss Phil (Christopher Maher). This is followed by a series of trite vignettes in which we see the happy young couple nesting and having a baby girl. There is no sign of Mitchs upcoming psychotic behavior. Then Slim discovers hes having an affair and all hell breaks loose. Dumb people dumb plot Suddenly Mitch is a raving misogynist who has wandered into this movie from the set of a Neil LaBute film. He practically foams at the mouth as he lays down the law to Slim. He tells her that he will have as many affairs as he wants and there is nothing she can do about it and then he proceeds to punch her out.

Starring Jennifer Lopez and Billy Campbell. Directed by Michael Apted. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 115 minutes.) ""Enough"" with Jennifer Lopez has two things that separate it from the pack of thrillers on the shelves Its almost unbearably tense and it has the biggest visceral kick capable of inspiring bloodlust in otherwise peaceful viewers. Seeing this movie about a woman on the run from an abusive husband makes us want to see J.Lo lay this guy out. To maintain that emotional pitch its not enough for a movie to simply show a man smacking a woman. Everything has to work and it does from the everywoman appeal of Lopez to the cunning direction of Michael Apted who squeezes every drop of suspense from every setup. Most of all its the screenplay by Nicholas Kazan (""Reversal of Fortune"") that transforms an arresting premise into a thriller of significance. Kazans most important inspiration was in the writing of the husband who is not a routine psycho who sprouts devil horns on the honeymoon. If Mitch were the husband from hell ""Enough"" would be a monster movie. Instead hes a husband from earth a fellow we recognize a kind of man we might know one who prides himself on getting what he wants whose self-conception is tied up with his willingness to go to any length to succeed. Mitches are everywhere and that alone gives ""Enough"" a modest social importance. Lopez plays Slim who meets Mitch (Billy Campbell) while working as a waitress. A few years later they have a little daughter and a nice house and all is well. There are only vague hints that he might have a vicious streak. He has a strange impassive way of looking at his wife when shes not facing him. Lopez has the image of being sexy and tough but her appeal as an actress is that shes down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. Theres nothing cold about her. She has a nice crackup scene when Slim finds out Mitch is cheating on her and when he hits her for the first time -- ""What I cant hit you?"" -- we feel her terror. Her big house has just become the Big House. Shes living in a prison. From this point on ""Enough"" becomes agonizingly suspenseful and nerve- racking. This film contains violence.
