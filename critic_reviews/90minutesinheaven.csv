Share Tweet An entire subgenre of books offers reassurance that readers can win the spiritual lottery Death is not the end; your friends and relatives are waiting for you; stay the faithful course. The fiscal success of last years adaptation of Heaven Is For Real and the general ongoing boom in ""faith-based"" (read Christian almost certainly evangelical) films practically guaranteed the adaptation of another best-seller in this genre Pastor Don Pipers 90 Minutes In Heaven. His testimony In January of 1989 Piper collided with an 18-wheeler while driving back home from a conference in Houston. Pronounced dead at the scene he was brought back to life through the efforts of a passer-by who prayed for him. After a long and difficult period of physical therapy Piper began sharing his story resulting in the sale of 7 million copies of his book and no fewer than 3000 speaking engagements. Michael Polishs film sticks close to this story clumsily alternating between the perspectives of Piper (Hayden Christensen mustachioed and drawlingly accented) and his patiently suffering wife Eva (Kate Bosworth). The biggest surprise about 90 Minutes in Heaven is how borderline secular it is. Jesus is semi-regularly invoked and prayer for Don a constant. But if you cut out those scenes and references youd be left with a professionally assembled still-overlong feature-length movie about a guy who following a horrific accident retreats into sullen post-traumatic silence. He treats his wife with great indifference until hes told to ""get your act together"" by a well-meaning friend pastor and mentor Jay B. Perkins (Fred Thompson). Dons 90 minutes in heaven are closer to five onscreen and those visions are held back like the shadowy monster of a cheap B-movie whos repeatedly concealed to save money. What we finally see--a sea of happy white people and two token black ones against a backdrop of clouds and blown-out light--is so thoroughly underwhelming you wonder why Polish bothered. The effect is rendered even more ridiculous by a change from the 1.85 format for the real world to 2.35 widescreen for heaven; whats on-screen is neither epic nor panoramic and makes the whole movie seem letterboxed in the theater. Theoretically its refreshing that a Christian film elides the usual pseudo-fiery agenda-setting in favor of a naturalistic portrait of a couples difficulties where religion is an underlying constant but not the sole topic of discussion. Yet while 90 Minutes In Heaven has a professional sheen miles above the clunky products peddled by PureFlix (Gods Not Dead) and their ilk that just makes it duller. The screenplay is full of infelicitous dialogue far from a plausible vernacular which wouldnt matter if the movie had an ounce of stylization to justify its fourth-grade-reading-level airport-novel vocabulary. For example Cruelly cut off from an emotionally unavailable Don Kate stares out at a skyline topped by holiday fireworks. Don in voiceover ""Unfortunately those were the only fireworks left in our marriage."" Christensen gives a credibly physical performance while mostly laid up in bed but flubs all the vocal components; cut from the soundtrack and laid over porn his pants and screams of agony would be taken for straight-up orgasms. Bosworth delivers a monolithic portrait of a troubled wife in pain drawing on the most standard tropes of the part a single tear falling here a pained whisper there. The main non-theological points of 90 Minutes In Heaven include Our health-care system is problematic (the bills pile up and how theyre paid is never resolved); husbands should be nice to their wives; and McDonalds is a terrific place to eat. The family embarks on many drive-through visits and at one point Eva takes the kids inside; bored viewers will notice that the luscious-looking burgers looking totally unlike anything ever served up by the chain in real life are left conspicuously uneaten by the kids as they tuck into the fries presumably because theyre inedible prop food. A faint sense of hucksterism lurks over the dull product which is selling the vague promise that regular prayer guarantees eventual admission to ""the greatest family reunion"" in Pipers voiceover words.Real-life Pastor Don delivers a sermon regarding his experience at the closing but his words offer no real sense of urgency or theological fervor. This perhaps is why the Southern Baptist Convention issued a resolution last year against these types of books saying they contain details ""antithetical to scripture"" and decrying how ""many devout and well-meaning people allow these to become their source and basis for an understanding of the afterlife rather than scriptural truth."" Such watery affirmations have little to do with the Bible which is true of this movie despite its occasional religious lip service.

It is intended simply as an observation not snarky criticism to suggest that ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" might more accurately be titled ""Five Months in Purgatory."" Inspired by Baptist minister Don Pipers bestselling account of his lengthy and arduous recovery from a 1989 auto mishap so serious that he initially was declared dead at the scene this inspirational indie earns points by being more bluntly realistic than many other faith-based dramas in its depiction of an ordeal that likely would challenge the faith of even the most devout Christians. Piper has testified that he got a glimpse at a warmly inviting afterlife and actually came tantalizing close to passing through the Pearly Gates during those long minutes when first responders considered him deceased. But while the movie respectfully accepts Pipers claim as fact writer-director Michael Polish (""Big Sur"") wisely refrains from depicting the near-death experience until well into his third act. Instead he concentrates more on the struggles that can be part of life after a miracle -- not unlike Peter Weirs ""Fearless"" -- and by doing so fashions a modestly compelling narrative that may attract a crossover audience in theaters and home-screen platforms. Piper (Hayden Christensen) is introduced as a Texas pastor and loving family man blessed with a beautiful wife (Kate Bosworth) three adorable low-maintenance children and a burning desire to do the Lords will by establishing a new church. But while driving across a two-lane bridge near Huntsville on his way home from a statewide Baptist conference Piper comes frightfully close to meeting Jesus a lot sooner than he expected An 18-wheel tractor trailer truck driven by a prison inmate smashes into Pipers Ford sedan crushing the vehicle and horribly injuring its driver. Fortuitously another minister drives by the accident scene just in time to pray over the apparently dead Piper -- and is overjoyed when Piper not only revives but joins him in a rendition of ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus."" Unfortunately Pipers ordeal has only just begun. Doctors in Huntsville and later a Houston trauma center are hard-pressed to patch up a man so battered and broken that as one specialist notes a broken pelvis is considered a low-priority item on the long list of injuries. Even after his condition is more or less stabilized Piper remains wracked by near-constant pain beset by bouts of depression (at one point he stops trying to breathe on his own) and bedeviled by guilt and shame as he feels altogether unworthy of the prayers and attention paid by family and friends. And yes he freely admits After getting a glimpse of what lies on the other side hes decidedly less than eager to face the rigors of recovery. ""Survival was going to be difficult"" Piper says in his role as the storys narrator ""because heaven was so glorious."" ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" is most effective as it details the emotional and financial cost of Pipers survival dealing with such nitty-gritty details as mounting medical bills a transfer to another (and presumably lesser) hospital after the insurance company curtails payments and the bad news delivered by an ambulance-chasing attorney (played perhaps a shade too flamboyantly by Dwight Yoakam) who discovers that Texas law drastically limits the amount of any settlement paid to someone in Pipers situation. Naturally the prayers of friends fellow parishioners and simpatico strangers are not merely thoughtful gestures but also invaluable resources for Piper and his family. (This is after all a faith-based movie.) But it takes a stern tough-love admonishment from an old friend and fellow pastor (played by Fred Dalton Thompson with all the authority he conveyed during his years as a D.A. on TVs ""Law and Order"") before Piper begins to realize that hes doing the people who care about him a grave disservice by hindering or repulsing their efforts to provide support and encouragement. Yea verily When Thompson issues his soft-spoken but straightforward warning -- ""You really need to get your act together"" -- his words have the impact of divine revelation. Christensen underplays throughout ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" even in scenes when Piper isnt operating under the influence of painkillers and his earnestness often comes off as monotonous. Still he generates interest and sympathy almost in spite of himself and Bosworth lends capable support as a loyal spouse who works overtime to hide -- from everyone but occasionally herself -- her feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Production credits are adequate although anyone familiar with the real-life Houston-area medical facilities referenced here may be amused by the smaller substitute locations employed throughout this filmed-in-Georgia feature.

CALL BRENDA HUBBARD OR MOTHER HUBBARD ILL DO WHAT I CAN... WEVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE SINCE ITS BEEN ANNOUNCED SEPTEMBER GET THE PEOPLES SUPPORT Reply Allie says October 4 2015 at 102 am if you truly belong to Jesus one mans story isnt going to challenge your faith. Only Gods Word is a reliable source regarding eternity. Too many deceiving spirits in these end days. Reply Wayne Rennicks says September 15 2015 at 117 pm I think that the entire point of the film was missed by all. I read the book and saw the movie. Its so funny to read how both the writer of the review and the comments listed sound so vaguely hostile. Such emphasis on the lack of super astounding visuals and eye candy depicting the next realm makes me think that what is waiting for these ""geniuses"" is pretty much a lost world of despair. Faith is like the wind. You cant see it but you feel it. One mans belief in something more than the sum of his worldly existence is the real story. One that can never be bottled or canned or even represented on film. The point of the film is to offer validation for those searching for something. Some people seem to require some sort of ""insurance"" product when it comes to what is next. You cant take anything with you. The American style of consumerism is really what is fake here. What does offering people the notion that their life is not all about ""running to and from work and the gym and getting the kids to Tae kwon do practice and making room for Tofu"". We all live. We all die. There is nothing more real than that. Does faith in a presence that provides a reference point that speaks to you on a level that does not violate any law or creed but rather inspires individuals to make sacrifice for others really threaten all of you? All this harmless film does is ask the question"" do you really need an insurance product when all you need is faith?"" Reply Jeff says September 13 2015 at 713 pm Saw it today with church group very boring movie. The guy only talks about his death experience for maybe 5 minutes and is very very vague. would never go see it again or recommend to anyone. BOOOOO Reply Bill B. says September 13 2015 at 931 am Yuk. I hadnt realized that Hayden Christensens career had gotten to this low a point. He held such promise at one time particularly in Shattered Glass. Seems like Star Wars of all things damaged his career. Reply Sal U.

During that time Don experienced heaven. The end? You wish. ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" a film directed and adapted by Michael Polish from Pipers memoir gives about 10 minutes to the death/eternity part and dedicates the rest to Don (Hayden Christensen in a terrible down-home accent) bitching and literally moaning. (Perhaps the stache makes him mumble.) Dons wife Eva is played by Polishs wife Kate Bosworth proving just how far the once-mighty (or almost-mighty) have fallen. Also Read Hayden Christensen to Star in Marco Polo Film for Original Fast and Furious Director To be fair though ""90 Minutes"" is one of the better faith-based films out there. The opening is tense as Don drives through heavy rain listening to a song on the radio whose chorus is ""Praise the Lord"" as he glances at a manuscript titled ""I Believe in a Great God"" to hammer home a point. You know the accident is coming however and you brace for it and its as terrific as you fear. Polish renders the crash a bit goofy when he freezes a frame of Don with a twisted mouth more likely seen on a comedian flying out of his seat. But the director for no obvious reason tries again just 11 minutes later re-creating a scene that viewers are unlikely to have forgotten. Another minister among the drivers stopped because of the accident approaches a sheriff and says hed like to pray for the victim. (Meanwhile a somewhat comically surly EMT says ""We know our business. We know hes dead."") He prays over Dons body and soon Don is...singing even though his bodys mangled. A miracle indeed. Also Read Hayden Christensen Adrien Brody Thriller American Heist Nearing Deal With Saban Films ""90 Minutes"" isnt much more far-fetched than the endless number of white-light stories that have been shared round the world including last years ""Heaven Is for Real"" and Clint Eastwoods 2010 ""Hereafter."" (Although the light is more golden than white here perhaps appropriate considering the film seems to be sponsored by McDonalds complete with two trips to the drive-thru.) But even if you watch this with your mind barely open the premise isnt what sinks the film. Its two-hour running time for instance is a killer. Turns out people can get really irritable after seeing heaven and Christensen manages to be his usual annoying self even while acting barely alive on a hospital bed groaning the weirdest groans youve ever heard. His character is a bit of a brat too actually pouting about being alive and at one point giving the silent treatment to hospital staff as well as his family. The sometimes-awful script may lighten your frustration with Eva saying things both ridiculous (""What happened to you?"") and less than grammatical (""You can take away your pain with that button but you are causing it to everyone else""). Bosworth in her fourth film directed by Polish isnt quite as flat as she was in say ""Superman Returns."" But she still has some ""oof"" moments such as when she says ""Im so afraid"" as casually as if she were saying ""Im craving a Quarter Pounder."" Maybe thats why Don as Eva watches fireworks from his hospital room remarks in voiceover ""Those were the only fireworks left in our marriage."" (Im thinking there was a giant near-death-size reason for that but maybe some couples still have sparks when one is bedridden and bloodied for months.) Dwight Yoakam has a terribly embarrassing role as Cecil Beaumont a ambulance-chaser who shills his legal services on billboards laden with lines such as ""Im your Beau"" and telling a joke to Eva to help explain a horrible setback. Some preview pieces have labeled it a comic turn; Im labeling it something Yoakam should scratch off his resume. The soundtrack is unsurprisingly heavy on strings which alternate between melancholy melodramatic and hopeful. The script meanwhile is heavy on prayer. That minister prayed Don back to life; Eva and their three kids fold their hands every chance they get; another preacher allegedly rallies churches ""all over the world"" to pray for Dons recovery as if the rest of the world didnt have bigger problems to worry about in 1989. See Photos Dennis Quaid Kate Bosworth Meet-Cute in Crackles Art of More First Look I havent read the book so I cant tell how much artistic liberty Polish took with the material. Evas side was reportedly incorporated into the storyline specifically her frustration dealing with a husband who remained emotionally unresponsive even after his physical unresponsiveness abated. Of course theres an uplifting ending. And with Elvis gorgeous ""Amazing Grace"" playing as the credits roll even nonbelievers might get some goosebumps. How ironic that in a film about faith and heaven your spirits are most dramatically raised by a sinner of a pop singer whom many religious people likely believe wound up going to hell.

Eva Piper (Kate Bosworth) is in her classroom when she learns of her husbands accident in ""90 Minutes in Heaven."" (Quantrell Colbert) Gary Goldstein A powerful true-life story of faith hope and survival has been turned into a didactic painful slog in ""90 Minutes in Heaven."" Based on the 2004 best-selling book by Don Piper and Cecil Murphey the film chronicles Baptist minister Pipers 1989 car wreck and his torturous road to recovery with the help of family and friends.The twist in Pipers tale He was pronounced dead by rescue workers at the accident scene only to awake 90 minutes later. During that period Piper says he visited heaven in all its traditional glory. Despite this wondrous experience Piper goes through tremendous soul-searching before he understands its meaning and can share what he felt with others. Intriguing and inspiring as Pipers journey may be the movie comes off as if director Michael Polish (""The Astronaut Farmer"" ""Big Sur"") felt a slavish duty -- or perhaps there was a mandate -- to adhere to Pastor Don and his familys every move and thought. To wit the excessive voiceovers often sound more like sermons than movie dialogue.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level the result is a sluggish clinical largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama.As the anguished Piper Hayden Christensen commits to his somber part but seems hemmed in by its beatific nature. That he spends so much of the movie lying immobile in a hospital bed adds to this sense of constraint. Kate Bosworth is equally dedicated to embodying Pipers devoted wife Eva but also seems confined by her saintly role.

Amazing true stories can be remarkable for their sheer wonder and seemingly unbelievable qualities -- but those details might not translate into an amazing movie.This is the case with ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" based on the best-selling book of the same name by Don Piper. Based on his own incredible life story the film adaptation written and directed by Michael Polish is an all-too-faithful rendition of this spiritual tale where minor details get mistaken for crucial moments.For Christian audiences the premise alone will be enough of a draw. In 1989 Don Piper (Hayden Christensen) a minister and married father of three was in a head-on collision with a big rig on a bridge in driving rain. Paramedics could find no pulse at the scene and his body was left underneath a tarp presumed dead for 90 minutes until another pastor prayed and sang over him.Don miraculously was revived but not until after he had a vision of the heavenly glories. Upon returning to his life on earth Don endured a long painful path to recovery that tested his faith family and self-worth.Its certainly a remarkable story about the perseverance of the human spirit and the lessons that one can learn in a near-death experience.However the film is a little too concerned with the veracity of its own details sacrificing satisfying cinematic storytelling in the process.Certainly many of the moments can be seen as moving in some way but when they are treated with overly heavy doses of meaning and then dropped without paying off down the line the story loses all momentum.Scenes with Dons father wishing he were in his place or a network of prayers organized in his honor or his wife Eva (Kate Bosworth) letting out a primal scream of frustration in the McDonalds drive thru certainly help to color in the real experiences of these characters.But they are all treated with the kind of soaring dramatic strings that signify Something Important is happening but then are promptly abandoned. If every moment is treated as important then none of them are really.Its not a traditional movie structure more like a series of vignettes that detail Dons journey. For a film that promises ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" its pretty scant on the heaven -- its more like Two Hours in a Hospital Bed.Moreover the effects that illustrate Dons vision of heaven are a let down done with a fairly standard cheesy pearly gates effect and a parade of Dons loved ones who have passed on.For fans of Pipers book and audiences of faith that are rarely catered to at the box office ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" will be a welcome treat with high-quality filmmaking and legitimate stars in Christensen and Bosworth. But as a cinematic story it fails to create a satisfying narrative with a true arc that pays off; its too caught up in explaining its minor details to focus on the big picture.1/290 Minutes in HeavenNow playing Tulare Galaxy 10; Visalia Stadium 10MPAA rating PG-13 for intense accident and injury images.Film facts Stars Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth.

Credit Quantrell Colbert/Samuel Goldwyn Films Caveat emptor ""90 Minutes in Heaven"" does not in fact depict a full hour and a half of the afterlife as the travel-guide-like title might suggest. Rather Michael Polishs cinematic homily dwells on the physical and spiritual recovery of a Texas pastor Don Piper (Hayden Christensen) after he is declared dead in a car crash. Its based on Mr. Pipers best-selling book.We mostly witness Dons arduous time in the hospital with visitors groaning and spelling out absolutely everything in voice-over. He struggles to accept the concern of others; his wife Eva (an alarmingly glacial Kate Bosworth) battles her impatience. She and another visitor take Don to task for being withdrawn somewhat unreasonably given his pulverized bones and relentless pain.The squeaky-clean production values mean that everything (including unblemished faces) appears blindingly white and bathed in soothing light even when Don isnt describing the heaven he saw while dead. The dialogue is often hilariously literal-minded and verbose; it is as if all else must be explained so that only the mysteries of God remain. Unforgettably Eva zings her husband about his hospital-bed call button ""You can take your pain away with that button but you are causing it to everyone else.""Mr. Christensen drawls away and hides behind a fuzzy-caterpillar mustache. Dwight Yoakam turns up for intentional comic relief as an ambulance-chasing lawyer but all the affirmations of goodness and inert conversations already flirt with the ridiculous.Rendering a miraculous premise dull the film seems relatively uninterested in doing more than preaching to the choir.""90 Minutes in Heaven"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
