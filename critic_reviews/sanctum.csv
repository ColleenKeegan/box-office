Or as professional wit and urban dweller Fran Lebowitz once wrote ""The great outdoors is what you have to go through to get from the apartment into the taxi."" Dont get me wrong. I love nature as much as any non-camper can. I bike hike kayak and regularly fill a bird feeder. I just dont see the need to test myself excessively against the elements and landscape. And why should I do it when the movies will do it for me? Lately there seem to be any number of films whose brave heroes or heroines are meant to inspire as they go mano-a-mano with the great outdoors. Personally I view these films as cautionary tales. Rock-climbing in an isolated canyon? No thank you not after watchig James Franco cut off half his arm in the real-life tale of hiker Aron Ralston in ""127 Hours."" Surfing? Nada. Not after seeing an early screening of ""Soul Surfer"" (opening April 8) about real-life teenage surfer Bethany Hamilton who nearly died when a shark chomped his arm off in Hawaii. She has since gotten back up on her board and succeeded as a professional surfer. And how many teen scream slasher movies start with everyone going on a camping trip to Lake Massacre? All of which brings me to ""Sanctum"" the latest entry in the Nature Can Be Bad for You sweepstakes. This one boasts some mighty impressive credentials James Cameron serves as executive producer and the movie was shot in 3D using the same camera system he employed for ""Avatar."" An adventure-survival tale ""Sanctum"" focuses on cave explorers in Papua New Guinea in the Pacific. ""Inspired by a true story"" its tells what happens when several of them get trapped in an underground and mostly underwater cave. The mixed lot includes the autocratic leader Frank (Richard Roxburgh) a master diver and explorer; his alienated teenage son (Rhys Wakefield); the brash American billionaire whos financing the expedition (Ioan Gruffud); the moguls adventurer girlfriend (Alice Parkinson); a joke-cracking crew member (Dan Wyllie); and the mostly non-English speaking native Papuan helper (Cramer Cain). One guess as to who is bumped off first. The movie the second feature directed by Alistair Grierson (""Kokoda"") features astonishing photography particularly in the underwater sequences and generates some real suspense especially when it dunks into the drink. Its downfall is its cliche-riddled and fusty script. Among the hoary groaners actors here are called upon to utter here ""What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?""; ""This cave isnt going to beat me""; and ""Lifes not a dress rehearsal; youve got to seize the day."" Its as if the screenwriters had dug up a dust-covered script from the old Stewart Granger days. Adolescents may identify with the films rebellious teen hero. Heck some thrill-seeking CEOs might even be inspired enough to take up caving themselves. Me Ill leave that to the professionals -- and the actors who play them. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The film follows a team of underwater cave divers on a treacherous expedition to the largest most beautiful and least accessible cave system on Earth. Distributed by Universal Studios . Photo Credit Jasin Boland / Rogue Pictures Photo Credit Jasin Boland / Rogue Pictures/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A group of trapped cave divers must find a way out. BOTTOM LINE The same 3-D technology used in ""Avatar"" with none of that movies imagination. CAST Richard Roxburgh Rhys Wakefield Alice Parkinson LENGTH 149 Produced by James Cameron and filmed with the same 3-D technology he used on ""Avatar"" the survival saga ""Sanctum"" proves that money alone does not a good movie make. Despite the millions clearly poured into it the film feels cheap and amateurish. See it on IMAX if you wish but the flaws will only look bigger. A throwback of sorts to the disaster films of the 1970s ""Sanctum"" follows a group of Australian divers exploring an underwater cave in Papua New Guinea. When a storm blocks the only known exit the team must search for a new passage to the surface. Along the way nerves will snap like guylines and tough choices will be made. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The film feels well-researched at least. Cameron is an avid diver as is the films co-producer and co-screenwriter Andrew Wight who based the story on a real-life experience. Whenever the dialogue turns to topics like decompression and rebreathers it sounds reasonably convincing. That cant be said for the one-dimensional characters or the mostly wooden actors who portray them. The main crew comprises the hard-nosed team leader Frank (Richard Roxburgh); his sensitive son Josh (Rhys Wakefield); the overly cocky Carl (Ioan Gruffudd); and his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Aside from the veteran Roxburgh no one is acting so much as reciting a script. At any rate theres little anyone could do with lines like ""This caves not gonna beat me."" Despite the messy directing by Alister Grierson the action sequences generate just enough excitement to keep you awake. Otherwise sitting through ""Sanctum"" feels like its own test of endurance. VideoSanctum advertisement | advertise on newsday Back story Aussie director has an avatar in Cameron If you think your boss is intimidating imagine how Alister Grierson feels. The Australian filmmaker who made his new movie ""Sanctum"" under the guiding hand of ""Avatar"" creator James Cameron had to present a finished cut to the director in Camerons Malibu home theater. ""Every time hed twitch I wondered Oh no what did I do wrong? "" recalled Grierson 41 who had previously directed only one other movie a small Australian war picture. ""It was like sitting with God at the pearly gates watching your entire life."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ""Sanctum"" is an unusual project for Cameron who rarely plays patron on other filmmakers work and has long talked about making a smaller feature but somehow keeps getting pulled back to ""Titanic""-size films. In fact while the trailer flashes his name early and often Cameron plays down his involvement. ""I cant stop the studio marketing people from picking the path that they think is going to make the most money for the movie but I would hope people would look past that"" he said. ""Its Andrew and Alisters film."" He does joke that he told the pair ""You guys are pretty much on your own. Ive gotta go finish Avatar.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 04 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English First a little truth in advertising. You may or may not be disappointed to learn that despite the proud branding in the trailers Sanctum is not a James Cameron film. He didnt direct it. He didnt write it. He did though serve as one of the multiple executive producers; and lent his patented 3-D camera left over from Avatar to the proceedings; and maybe given his fondness for watery depths even had a hand in hatching the general idea. Movies Sanctum The official trailer To wit stick that camera down an aquatic cave wrap a paper-thin plot around it slap the whole thing up on an IMAX screen and call it a movie. More truth in advertising Call it a lame movie. The actual director Alister Grierson starts by offering a minor reward for putting on those hefty plastic glasses. He takes us on a swooping helicopter ride over the jungles of Papua New Guinea then hovers for an aerial view of Esaala better known in these frames as ""the mother of all caves."" Gathered around the mother is a grizzled daddy name Frank (Richard Roxburgh) the expeditions Aussie leader who as he later confesses ""hasnt been anything of a father"" to his teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield). Seems they dont get along but no worries mate - expect male bonding to ensue. There too are Carl the financier Victoria his lady love and assorted other mortals accessorized with heaps of high-tech gear for the spelunking descent. And descend we do first into the cave proper then into the aforementioned watery depths. Actually our first dive is almost thrilling if only because the hoary dialogue stops while the film turns blissfully silent just heavy breathing and pretty bubbles. Indeed in dramatizing the mini-disaster that always precedes the big disaster Grierson issues his only gripping scene - the look on a disoriented divers face when down is indistinguishable from up when the mask fills inexorably with water and that last breath is nigh. Unfortunately back up top someone breaks the silence by opening his yap and insisting that ""Panic is the vulture that sits on your shoulder."" Sounds messy. Soon of course we got ourselves a whole flock of vultures squatting on a whole bunch of shoulders. Why? Easy Violent storm floods cave exit sealed off must find other way out who will survive? Yep the plot. Not that we care much for the simple reason that although the new-fangled camera has a third dimension the characters do not - and well one flat demise looks pretty much like another. Consequently when a dark soul informs us that ""there is no God down here"" the only possible response is an atheistic shrug followed by our own deep plunge into sarcasm ""Hell whats worse there aint no drama either."" However thanks to that precious third D and the presence of so many scuba divers in peril there is ample opportunity to enjoy the delight of getting kicked in the eye by a madly thrashing flipper. I surely did duck a time or three. And dont forget the poignancy of all that father-son bonding. Memo to lifestyle editors Assign your best scribe to report on the hitherto obscure fact that parenting skills are vastly improved by the proper mixture of Dark Caves + Lethal Water + Near-Death Experiences. Then again it helps that grizzled old Frank turns out to have a surprisingly poetic side forever quoting the first lines of Coleridges Kubla Khan. Yep ""a stately pleasure dome"" keeps on getting decreed. If only it got delivered. Instead we get the moral of the tale issued early by another yapper on dry ground ""Lifes not a dress rehearsal you gotta seize the day."" Oh well said. So carpe Sanctum dude but caveat emptor. That exhausts my store of Latin yet luckily I still have a few Advil left - those damn plastic glasses do weigh on a fellow.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Sanctum 3D Recommended Video Rated R  109 minutes  2011 After a sluggish half hour this well-crafted adventure kicks into high gear and never lets up. A veteran diver (Richard Roxburgh) is hired by a cocky thrill-seeking financier (Ioan Gruffudd) to map an underground river through a network of spectacular caves and tunnels in Papua New Guinea. But he hasnt counted on working with his estranged son (Rhys Wakefield) an expert climber and tempers flare in the close quarters as a cyclone raging aboveground interrupts communications with the surface crew. James Cameron served as executive producer and the 3-D process he perfected for Avatar adds depth to the underwater scenes and texture to the subterranean settings (most of which were shot on a soundstage). Roxburgh invests his character with a harsh fatalism that echoes the screenplays allusions to ancient Greek myths about Hades patricide and hubris. Alister Grierson directed.

"Sanctum review James Cameron-produced 3D underwater thriller is sunk by cliches |       NJ.com comments Sanctum review James Cameron-produced 3D underwater thriller is sunk by cliches Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 04 2011 at 756 AM View/Post Comments Jasin Boland/Courtesy Universal Pictures/MCTFrank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh left) and his son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) star in a scene in the 3D action-thriller ""Sanctum."" James Cameron is a complicated man of simple pleasures. Water. Women. Scuba-diving. Technology. And stories about one mad dedicated genius whos right when everyone else is wrong and fights the corporate naysayers to prove it. You know -- kind of like James Cameron. You can see what he saw in ""Sanctum"" a story about water women scuba diving technology and one mad dedicated genius who -- well you know. Cameron only produced this film which was directed by Alister Grierson and cast with a bunch of forgettable Welsh and Aussie actors. But it has his singular stamp all over it. Movie Review Sanctum (R) Universal (109 min.) Directed by Alister Grierson. With Richard Roxburgh Ioan Gruffudd. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains strong language violence and brief nudity. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS A sort of ""127 Hours 100 Fathoms Down"" its about a bunch of scuba-diving spelunkers who get trapped in an underwater cavern. Can they find a new way to the surface? Well maybe -- but only after the usual characters are quickly killed off (its never a good idea to be a minority in one of these movies) and everyone does a lot of screaming at each other. Its all done with a lack of humor too and no real scares. Although the main characters -- gung-ho hero and weaselly capitalist -- seem to have wandered in from ""Aliens"" or ""Avatar"" unfortunately they havent been followed by any aliens. Theres just water water everywhere -- and no one stops to think. Thats because theyre too busy yelling. Mostly Richard Roxburgh as the hero who comes off like Crocodile Dundee in a bad mood. And Ioan Gruffudd as the bad guy whose grasp of an American accent is as slippery as his hold on those slimy rocks. And occasionally a woman -- there only to panic or make a bad decision or otherwise get in the mens way. That little misogynist cliche doesnt feel like Cameron -- who like him or not always wrote strong females -- and its a drag on the film. So too despite the fine 3D effects is some pretty plebeian photography. The whole idea after all is that these people are willing to risk their lives for the chance to be somewhere no one has ever been before to see things no one has ever seen. But when they do get there the plot demands they rush on. And when we do glimpse what they see -- mostly slimy gray walls lit by flashlights -- its hard to be impressed. If this were as one character promises a spread in the new National Geographic -- well youd quickly turn the page. You cant do that in a theater though. You can only sit and watch and sometimes feel a little claustrophobic and sometimes marvel at what actors will put themselves through. And mostly hope that the next time James Cameron wants to make a movie he directs it himself.

(Universal Pictures/A) Joe Neumaier Friday February 4 2011 400 AM Title Sanctum A cave-diving team faces catastrophe. With Ioan Gruffud Rhys Wakefield. Director Alister Grierson. (149) R Violence language. At area theaters.Though James Cameron only executive-produced ""Sanctum"" this man-versus-nature adventure has all the earmarks of the Oscar-winning filmmakers movies -- which can at times suck the air out of things.Big as they are Camerons blockbusters are interwoven with an often aggravating earnestness. Put aside technological high-watermarks and box-office success and what stands out about ""The Abyss"" ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" is how Boy Scout their emotions are. ""Sanctum"" directed by documentarian Alister Grierson feels the same only without any gloss so it comes close to being an extended version of an Imax movie at the Museum of Natural History. Still when the movie needs to it can rock n roll.Inspired in a bare-bones way by a real-life Australian diving accident in 1988 ""Sanctum"" begins as Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) a wanna-be-adventurer millionaire arrives in Papua New Guinea with his mountaineer girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson) to go cave-diving. Their team is led by Frank (Richard Roxburgh) an irascible veteran caver whos spent more time underground than with his now-grown son Josh (Rhys Wakefield).After those four and their technicians start spelunking inside ""the largest unexplored cave system in the world"" a sudden hurricane floods the cavern sealing their entryway. Trapped they have to trust Frank to get them to an ocean exit before they drown get smashed against the rocks or fall prey to bad judgments and petty rivalries.Once the cliches are dispensed with -- Frank ""likes to play by his own rules"" and ""can only make sense of things"" when hes in the center of the earth -- there are some gripping thrills. Water is both friend and foe the sense of claustrophobia is palpable and by the movies midway point the bodies start to pile up. (A double-feature of this and ""127 Hours"" might kill the last subscriptions to Backpacker magazine.)It all looks sharp though the 3-D is wasted except for a scene in a tunnel. The acting meanwhile is stuck in one dimension. Gruffudd (""The Fantastic Four"") delivers laugh-inducing groaners and Wakefield who resembles a young Michael York may as well be playing Basil Exposition for all the back-story he provides. At least Roxburgh is a gruff cartoon a fun Aussie combo of Captains Nemo and Queeg.The screenplay by underwater explorer-filmmaker Andrew Wight and diver-screenwriter John Garvin is naturally spot-on with the descent drama (Wight was actually part of the 88 expedition). If youre able to think of characters as just air bubbles to get past then dive in the excitements fine.

Starring Richard Roxburgh Ioan Gruffudd Rhys Wakefield and Alice Parkinson. Directed by Alister Grierson. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Sanctum"" is by no means a badly made movie but it has the feel of one of those dramatic re-enactments made exclusively for Imax theaters. It has the chipper characterless dialogue and the earnest helpful soundtrack. It takes place in an exotic location and is filmed in 3-D by people who werent playing at it. But its almost two hours long and those Imax movies usually run only about 45 minutes. That tells you just about everything thats wrong with ""Sanctum"" in a sentence. James Cameron produced it though its in every other way an Australian production with an Australian director Alister Grierson and a mostly Australian cast. If youre looking for the Cameron influence you might infer it in the 3-D effects. When it rains the rain seems to be falling on the first 20 rows of the movie theater. In the opening scene which takes place outside in a busy area every character looks to be hovering in his own separate space. Its amazingly lifelike but more blurry and its interesting - clearly a step forward into what 3-D is eventually going to look like. Related Stories Sanctum Yet surprisingly the subject and location of ""Sanctum"" dont lend themselves to the 3-D treatment as much as might be expected. At least 90 percent of it takes place inside a cave and a lot of screen time is taken up by people either swimming in the cave pools or trying to make their way through thin tunnels. That means that most of the time there is either no visible foreground or that people are so close to each other and the camera is so close to them that the 3-D possibilities are minor. But who are we to be selfishly wanting visual stimulation when these people are going through torture I tell you torture? And to think how happy they were at the start ""Sanctum"" is a movie that tries to make you feel that theres this cool thing going on that everybody knows about except you. The thing in this case is that there are these cool cave explorers who love going 2 kilometers beneath the earth in order to see things that no human being has ever seen before. Like rocks. To them ""cave"" is a verb and they are ""cavers."" Or ""nuts"" depending on your point of view. And then one day - oh no - it starts raining and the water in that cave starts rising faster than a flood in a Johnny Cash song. Their escape route is closed and with limited supplies they start saying things like ""What the hell is going on?"" and ""We gotta get out of here"" Their struggles eventually become monotonous but theres no denying that the film is intermittently harrowing and effective. It must be effective because by the end I felt claustrophobic and wanted to claw and climb over people to get to the exit. I wonder if thats a good thing. Ive gotten this far without mentioning the actors but theyre not really playing characters just dialogue-spouting entities taking turns getting killed. Ioan Gruffudd who has been excellent elsewhere is wasted as a dilettantish adventurer. Richard Roxburgh comes close to a real performance playing an explorer whose nature is as hard as the rocks down there. As for the rest they dont get to do much besides curse a lot. Apparently they decided to go for the R rating and once they did they made sure everybody got a few curses in. They should have cast Joe Pesci and really got their moneys worth. -- Advisory Strong language. (Do you think thats funny? Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?)

The good news on ""Sanctum"" is that it is merely exec-pro duced not written by James Cameron. The bad news is that it sounds like it was written by the star pupils at the Cameron Academy of Screenwriting. ""Sucks to be you"" ""This cave will kill you in a heartbeat"" and ""Are we gonna do this? Or are we just gonna talk about it?"" are typical lines in a movie about divers who (for some reason) are exploring caves 2000 meters below the surface in Papua New Guinea. They seem to care about where the cave network will lead them but no one on-screen ever furnishes any reason why we in the audience should and ""Sanctum"" turns out to be as gripping as plankton. This 3-D movie which has some nifty effects and graphics and the occasional pretty tableau nevertheless is just a dolled-up 70s disaster movie in which the only reason to stick around till the end is to find out who in the cast will triumphantly live and who will colorfully perish. But as the divers deal with a flood that cuts off their route to the surface and forces them deeper ""Sanctum"" doesnt stand up so well against ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Shelley Winters and Gene Hackman were rousing and memorable in their ridiculous way. This movie features the dismal likes of Australians Richard Roxburgh and Rhys Wakefield as a father-son team of tough guys bonding through episodes of manly peril. Roxburgh for all his growly badinage isnt fit to carry Lee Marvins cigar box while Wakefields incessant incandescent smiling suggests he thinks hes doing ""Mamma Mia"" instead of an undersea adventure. The best actor in the piece is the journeyman Ioan Gruffudd best known as the elastic man from ""Fantastic Four."" Cameron to his credit doesnt make boring movies and if he were in charge you could count on him to at least produce some clammy monsters and/or evil corporations to give the heroes something to do besides churn through the murk. Instead director Alister Grierson treads water. His cast confronts dumb dangers like cowards going nuts (really if you were thousands of feet below the surface would you attack the ablest diver in your group?) and lady divers coming down with severe attacks of the girlies in one case because her hair gets caught in a chain. One characters doom is telegraphed with such blaring obviousness that I was reminded of a Mad magazine spoof of ""The Shining"" in which the Scatman Crothers figure wore a button labeling him ""token victim."" A symbolically important flashlight (or ""torch"" in Australian) is pulled out at the exact moment when it is guaranteed to be unintentionally hilarious its teeny-tiny wattage instantly lighting up 50 million gallons of black water like the red carpet of a movie premiere. The script keeps trying to talk us into being awed and fascinated by this clunky spelunking the writers sounding like stock pitchmen hawking shares in Macho Men Inc. ""Carl likes to play by his own rules."" ""Frank you are one stubborn son of a bitch."" ""It was the most heroic goddamn thing Ive ever seen."" I didnt expect Tom Stoppard-level writing. But nor did I expect to long for the relative panache of Sly Stallone. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Tom Hanks becomes a grandfather report Read Next Tom Hanks becomes a grandfather report Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 45717 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20967 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 16073 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

When a tropical storm forces them deep into the caverns they must fight raging water deadly terrain and creeping panic as they search for an unknown escape route to the sea. Starring Richard Roxburgh Alice Parkinson Rhys Wakefield Dan Wyllie Christopher Baker Allison Cratchley Sean Dennehy Director Alister Grierson Running time 143 Release Opened Feb 4 2011  Editorial Review Here comes that sinking feelingBy Mark JenkinsFriday February 4 2011Remember the climax of ""Titanic which seemed to consist mostly of Kate and Leo scurrying around below deck discovering that every path was blocked by cascading water? Well ""Sanctum"" is nothing like that because a) there are five people scurrying around and b) theyre in submerged caverns not submerged corridors. Plus its in 3-D. Executive producer James Cameron might not have had much to do with ""Sanctum"" which is a relatively low-budget production. But the movie directed by Alister Grierson does use Camerons 3-D cinematography techniques (which worked a lot better in ""Avatar"") and reflects his preference for spectacle over screenwriting. Set in Papua New Guinea (but filmed in Australia with a largely Australian cast) ""Sanctum"" sends about a dozen divers on an expedition into sprawling partially flooded catacombs. The ones who count are crusty master spelunker Frank (Richard Roxburgh); his resentful teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield); cocky American Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) whos financing the dive; Carls athletic girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson); and George (Dan Wyllie) a veteran caver whos savvy but burned out. The sequences introducing these explorers are ineptly written; the dialogue mixes cliches with phony tough-guy banter and TV-sports mottos. (One supporting player rarely says anything but ""lets do it."") The movie is most convincing when the characters have air tubes in their mouths and its always cause for alarm when the adventurers stop swimming to talk out some conflict. A typhoon is moving in which is good reason to exit a subterranean cave system. But Frank is in no hurry and the colleagues he sends toward the portal find it inundated by heavy rain. The survivors head back to their leader who vows to lead them to the surface by another uncharted course. Not all of them will make it of course. The subsequent action scenes are well staged with moments that are certain to jangle anyone with even mild claustrophobia acrophobia or aquaphobia. The underground mishaps soon make their point however and only the most dedicated X-treme sports fans will thrill to every stumble slip and fall. The sensation of being trapped shifts from the vicarious to the actual. ""Sanctum"" opens with the claim that its inspired by a true story; that real-life incident actually involved co-writer Andrew Wight. But Wights adventure was a lot less grisly than the one he and John Garvin have devised. This is a movie that features not one but two graphic mercy killings. Forget ""127 Hours"" ""Sanctum"" makes sawing off your own arm look like a minor penalty for the crime of spelunking while clueless.Contains strong language violence and disturbing images.

"Sanctum Dont cave in and see this mess - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Sanctum Dont cave in and see this mess By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Sanctum strives to be the Titanicof spelunkers. But actually being stuck in a remote waterlogged grotto might be more tolerable than enduring this disaster of an adventure movie. By Jasin Boland AP Keep digging Richard Roxburgh left and Rhys Wakefield are a father and son trapped in a cave. EnlargeClose By Jasin Boland AP Keep digging Richard Roxburgh left and Rhys Wakefield are a father and son trapped in a cave. Claustrophobics beware 95% of the action takes place trapped in stony underground confines. And cinephiles take note The influence of executive producer James Cameron-- his cringingly bad dialogue most of all -- lurks around every watery corner. Thanks to a flash flood a crew of explorers becomes trapped within a labyrinthine mass of unexplored South Pacific caverns. No run-of-the-mill caves they are the largest system of underwater caves in existence. And theyre mighty treacherous. It certainly sounds like a workable setting for terror and thrills. But as the survivors get pushed into the cavernous depths the story lacks the tension of even a middling thriller. Leading the pack is Frank (Richard Roxburgh) the worlds premier cave explorer. Impressive as he is probing stony masses hes not much of a father. Still his estranged teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) agrees to take an expedition with the father he resents. Along for the ride is the playboy/adventurer financing it all Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Sanctum  out of four Stars Richard Roxburgh Ioan Gruffudd Rhys Wakefield Alice Parkinson Dan Wyllie Director Alister Grierson DistributorUniversal Pictures Rating R for language some violence and disturbing images Running time 1 hour 43 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The characters are essentially types and stupendously uninteresting ones at that. Theres the gruff master explorer who has little use for smooth Mr. Moneybags and his adventure-loving babe and theres the aggrieved son who just tries to get along. The ancillary characters are even more one-dimensional but they get dispensed with quickly. Had Cameron directed it might have been worth watching at least for the visual splendors. But director Alister Grierson is no Cameron. Sanctum utilizes the 3-D camera techniques Cameron used in shooting Avatar intended for use in extreme environments. But the 3-D in the opening scenes is a muddy waste -- particularly in IMAX. Rather than fully conveying the power of fearsome cliffs and crevasses natural formations get obscured by human backs or jutting shoulders partially blocking the frame. And what spectacular shots do occasionally emerge are quickly dampened by the tedious tale. One of last years best films --127 Hours-- centered on a man trapped in a cave. Now we have one of this years worst focused on a group stuck in a cave. Both are based on actual ordeals but they couldnt be more different when it comes to artistry acting storytelling and suspense. A documentary on the formation of stalagmites would have been more compelling. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

The good news about the film has to do with its gorgeous imagery. Just when 3-D was looking like a goose doomed to lay overpriced and mostly rotten eggs this action adventure about cave diving serves as a reminder of how potent the process can be when the right equipment falls into the right hands. (Consumer warning I saw the IMAX version; your visual experience at non-IMAX theaters may differ.) The bad news concerns both the writing which ranges from 1-D to No-D and two of the four main performances which have the solidity and emotional depth of damp cardboard. No film in recent memory has been so strenuously at war with itself although for me a self-confessed sucker for the IMAX brand of eye candy the images narrowly--as well as widely--carry the day. Watch a clip from Sanctum a 3D action-thriller which follows a team of underwater cave divers in the South Pacific. Over the past three decades Mr. Cameron has taken one dive after another into movies about the deepest reaches of the planets seas. The best known are ""Titanic"" of course and ""The Abyss"" but his submarine adventures began with ""Piranha Part Two The Spawning"" (scuba divers vs. mutant munchers) and include excellent documentaries; you could also make a case for the jungles of ""Avatar"" as Great Barrier Reef scenery minus the briny. The screenplay for this new fiction film was inspired insufficiently by a misadventure that befell Andrew Wight a longtime Cameron colleague and an undersea explorer in his own right. During a 1981 exploration of an Australian cave system a freak storm collapsed the cave entrance leaving Mr. Wight the expeditions leader and more than a score of his companions trapped underground until rescuers could reach them. ENLARGE Rhys Wakefield takes a dive as Josh in Sanctum. Universal Studios In ""Sanctum"" which was directed by Alister Grierson that storm has been upgraded to cyclone status. The cave has grown into a stupendous 3-D labrynth beneath Papua New Guinea. The possibility of rescue has been removed--those who dont save themselves from the flooded chambers will surely die. The story centered on the father-son conflict evolves into a coming-of-age saga as well as a discourse on the dire consequences of bad choices. And the explorers have become a fractious group of characters played by Australian actors who either do credible work--Richard Roxburgh is the expeditions ruthlessly demanding leader Frank and Rhys Wakefield is Josh the loving son Frank disdains--or who do their best acting with their dive masks on Ioan Gruffudd is Carl the heavy and I mean heavy and Alice Parkinson is Victoria a beautiful but headstrong rock climber and dilettante diver with a foul mouth (when it isnt filled with water). Dan Wyllie is enjoyable in the small role of Crazy George a cave-diving veteran who isnt crazy at all only beset by ill health and circumstances that cause him to fizz out. You will learn the meaning of fizzing out if you choose to see ""Sanctum."" You will also learn the meaning of not-quite self-parody--writing thats bad enough to prompt occasional giggles (""Every fiber of her being was driven to explore"") yet not good enough at badness to qualify as spoof. But... These 3-D cameras can and frequently do conjure up whole screenfuls of splendor in the midst of dramatic drivel and dialogue (""Since the beginning of time no human being has ever seen this"") thats worthy of a 1930s Fitzpatrick travelogue. The director of cinematography Jules OLoughlin and the 3-D supervisor Chuck Comisky used essentially the same technology employed in ""Avatar"" and it shows. In a wide-angle shot of a vast underwater chamber two divers hover near the top like sparrows beneath a cathedral dome. A skydiver soars from ground level into the cave systems gaping maw. Climbers drop from nowhere on cables then drop out of sight without warning. A sort of water-borne (and water-born) starchild floats up to a lacework coral ceiling. Desperate swimmers determined to survive wriggle through small apertures in scenes of remarkable intimacy. One of the mysteries of the 3-D IMAX experience is how elastic its spaces can be. Long shots like that cave cathedral loom up as mighty monuments while closeups like those wriggling escapees seem to be taking place a few feet from your face. Whats at play in both cases is the kind of visual and emotional intensification that feature films keep reaching for in their desperate effort to survive increasing competition from television instant downloads social networks video games and all the rest. Yet that technology weaves a spell only when theres something worth intensifying and the technical elements are up to snuff. When 3-D is grafted onto bad movies like ""The Green Hornet"" or ""Gullivers Travels"" they remain bad movies. ""Sanctum"" is far from a good movie just as 3-D is far from the movie industrys savior. But it certainly looks good and watching it through those plastic glasses reopens your eyes to the promise of the third dimension. The Other Woman This moist and meandering drama adapted from Ayelet Waldmans novel ""Love and Other Impossible Pursuits"" wouldnt be worth bothering with as a theatrical release--its been available for several weeks via video on demand--were it not for the presence of Natalie Portman in the title role. Her presence as it turns out cant save the film which was written and directed by Don Roos and the film does nothing useful for her reputation. ENLARGE Natalie Portman as Emilia the title character and Charlie Tahan as William in The Other Woman. IFC Films She plays Emilia a recent Harvard law-school grad who marries her lawyer boss Jack (Scott Cohen); tries to cope with his precocious young son William (Charlie Tahan) as well as his fire-breathing ex-wife Carolyn (a ghastly performance by Lisa Kudrow) and loses an infant daughter to SIDS. The infants death happens more or less off-screen. (Its depicted in a clumsy though mercifully brief montage that may have been inspired by the much longer and ineffably beautiful montage of a happy marriage in ""Up."") Most of what happens on screen is talk explanations more talk further explanations of whats been discussed and recapitulations of discussions that might have been misconstrued for lack of thorough explanation. Lest my own reaction be misconstrued let me explain that I didnt like a single one of these insufferable narcissists the kid included. William is supposed to be lactose-intolerant? Well Im brat-intolerant. Its hard to understand what Emilia ever saw in Jack whose charm quotient is zilch; hard to figure out the movies wavering stance--feelingful satirical or what?--toward a mawkish memorial walk through Central Park thats meant to assuage the grief of parents whove lost an infant; and impossible to guess what the actors thought they were doing during a bizarre scene in which Carolyn heaps icy compassion on a distraught Emilia. Ive barely begun to suggest all the things ""The Other Woman"" has on its mind. They include self- hatred self-punishment self- forgiveness reconciliation between father and daughter the difference between ice cream and hummus and the difficulties of getting a Manhattan kindergartener into a good elementary school. The main thing on my mind was when the turgidity would end.

"Movie Review James Camerons Sanctum | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie Review James Camerons SanctumJames Camerons Sanctum takes your breath away with its thrills and 3-D cinematography but its groan-worthy dialogue takes you out of the picture.The 3-D action-thriller Sanctum has plenty of thrills but a weak script that barely stays afloat.  (Jasin Boland / photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 3 2011 Sanctum (out of 4) Starring Richard Roxburgh Rhys Wakefield Ioan Gruffudd Alice Parkinson and Dan Wyllie. Directed by Alister Grierson. At major theatres. 108 minutes. 14A The first rule of diving we learn in Sanctum is never to hold your breath. Whether thats actually true may be debatable. But the dictum doesnt apply to people watching this submersible 3-D thriller which is executive produced by James Cameron and directed by his Aussie protege Alister Grierson. For much of the film and despite groan-worthy dialogue that often takes you right out of the picture youll likely be holding your breath in genuine suspense. Sanctum succeeds as escapist entertainment on more than one level. A group of extreme ""cavers"" are trapped inside a vast underground labyrinth adjacent to the South Pacific and they have to find a way out. Thats the good news. The bad news is that the screenplay by John Garvin and Andrew Wight reportedly based on Wights real-life experience is equally boxed in. It often provokes unintended laughter for its run-on stream of machoisms ""This caves not gonna beat me ... Theres no God down here ... Panic is a vulture that sits on your shoulder"" Not much effort is expended on getting to know the team lead by master explorer Frank (Richard Roxburgh) who uses ""cave"" as a verb and who has spent so much time in the unplumbed depths of the Esa-ala Caves of Papua New Guinea he seems to have lost all ability for human empathy. Either that or his wetsuit is too tight around the nether regions. Frank barely has time to acknowledge the presence of his son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) whom hes ignored for most of the kids 17 years (cue emotional subplot). Crabby Frank has even less time for two people who are apparently helping bankroll the expedition playboy financier Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) and his arm candy Victoria (Alice Parkinson) a diving rookie neither of whom heed Franks constant safety barks. ""What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?"" Victoria deadpans. The only person whom Frank seems to trust and care about is another veteran caver who wears a Ramones T-shirt (Hey Ho Lets Go) and who is appropriately named Crazy George (Dan Wyllie). Theyve brought with them an impressive array of underwater gear and computer equipment which the camera lingers on with fetishistic fascination or perhaps just to enhance product placements. Why exactly are Frank and his fellow daredevils making this dangerous expedition? Because its Down There and because in the words of one jock ""Theres nowhere else left on the planet to explore"" And it is an impressive sight viewed in 3-D that makes good use of the technology Cameron developed for Avatar at least until trouble sets in. Thats when a raging cyclone that Frank apparently didnt foresee closes the entrance to the caves with a cascade of water and debris forcing his team to find another way out of what Josh colourfully calls ""this sphincter of rock."" Early on it becomes apparent that Cameron and Grierson intend Sanctum to be a horror thriller rather than another of the undersea documentaries Cameron made in the decade between Titanic and Avatar. We graphically see what happens when someone fails to obey one of Franks safety orders. A pattern is quickly set just like in those cheesy horror movies where people forget to turn on the lights or who recklessly declare ""Ill be right back."" If you ignore Frank youll regret it -- and what happens wont be pretty. Not that Frank makes it easy since hes constantly in the faces of both his teammates and the audience. He also has the thankless job of uttering most of the films most wretched lines whether its quoting from Coleridges epic poem Kubla Khan or making it clear unlucky it is to be lost in the Esa-ala Caves ""There are no rescues down here only body recovery."" Too bad there are also no script doctors. But chances are you wont care much because once Frank and his team realize they have to go down to get back up its game on. All that rock water sweat and blood goes a long way to silencing flapping gums.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Cave diving is like an inverted form of mountain climbing with the added danger that you have to complete your treacherous trek before your air runs out. The inherent tension of the endeavor carries ""Sanctum"" past cardboard characters and clearly telegraphed calamities befalling a scuba team exploring a vast New Guinea cavern. The film is essentially an unpretentious old-fashioned man-against-nature adventure with a number of effective set pieces and solid 3-D effects giving eerie dimension to the underwater cathedrals the divers encounter. If not for the by-the-numbers script a slim collection of underdeveloped characters and generally flat acting the film could have had a real punch. The films central relationship is the strained bond between hard-nosed diving veteran Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) and his teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield). Josh resents his fathers authoritarian ways rebelling where he can obeying when he must. Frank responsible for the safety of the team hes leading into a dangerous uncharted cave system has no time for second-guessing or debate. When a sudden tropical storm forces the diving party deep into the caverns they are literally on a downward spiral. They must face raging currents unforgiving terrain and frayed nerves as they hunt for a subterranean exit that may not exist. Since the party includes the missions cocky dilettante financier (Ioan Gruffudd) his headstrong girlfriend (Alice Parkinson) and a diver (Dan Wyllie) whose lungs have been compromised by a severe case of the bends its easy to see that the cast will dwindle as the film lumbers along. The action set pieces are passable but their impact is diminished because the characters are thinner than seaweed. The best thing about the film is the otherworldly underwater photography. The director Alister Grierson has a lush Old Masters palette -- deep blacks oaky browns blue-white light and sudden shocking jolts of blood red -- which practically glows. You can understand why James Cameron Hollywoods Aqua-man agreed to sign on as the films executive producer. But you have to wonder why he didnt see that most of the actors and the writing team were stinking up the screen. ""Sanctum"" isnt laughably bad but its a slog.

The true story here however - harrowing but with a happy ending - has been transformed by the filmmakers into an elimination-round spelunking nightmare.Set in a huge and largely unexplored cave system in Papua New Guinea (""the mother of all caves"" were told - cut to an aerial shot of her vulvic maw ringed by rain forest green) Sanctum follows a team of underwater cavers who become trapped when a flash flood blocks their escape route.I wont be the jerk who gives it all away but suffice to say that Sanctum - a 3-D spectacle deploying the same hi-def technology James Cameron (an executive producer) used in Avatar - is grisly stuff. The movie shot in Australia with an Aussie and British cast makes 127 Hours look like a walk in the park.But if 127 Hours did a masterful job of exploring the psychology of its trapped canyoneer hero taking us into Aron Ralstons head and heart Sanctum hardly bothers with such business. The thrill-seekers here are just two-dimensional cutouts in a 3-D tableau Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) a hotshot American financier who has also scaled Mount Everest; Victoria (Alice Parkinson) his extremely sporty gal-pal; Crazy George (Dan Wylie) the experienced hand; Luko (Cramer Cain) the faithful native; Judes (Allison Cratchley) the dangerously tired and untethered diver; and - the big relationshop - Frank (a buff Richard Roxburgh) arrogant veteran caver and leader of the pack and Josh (Rhys Wakefield) his 17-year-old son. Their relationship is marked by scowling disapproval (Frank) and defiant shrugs (Josh).With ace underwater photography and scuba-diving stunt doubles Sanctum doesnt stint on action. Wild flumes hurl the cave divers against the smooth rock faces of their eerie subterranean aquatic world while ego clashes and fractious rivalries - not to mention a mounting sense of dread - hurl one diver at the next.Director Alister Grierson and cinematographer Jules OLoughlin appear to have studied Camerons Avatar long and hard framing their shots with looming foreground figures and artful off-in-the-distance-ringed-in-light silhouettes. Camerons own underwater epics - The Abyss Aliens of the Deep - also seem to be of influence. Perhaps Camerons patented 3-D equipment came with a proviso Pay homage or else. And I can swear theres a line of dialogue - ""What can possibly go wrong diving in caves?"" - that was dubbed by Camerons Aliens and Avatar muse Sigourney Weaver.But that was probably all in my head.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Is a movie about people trapped in a cave more claustrophobic in 3-D or less? Arguably more You should feel the walls closing in on you and in the best scenes in ""Sanctum you do. A pity those scenes are far and few between. This adventure-survival saga ""presented by executive producer James Cameron as a way to keep his 3-D equipment from gathering dust between ""Avatar installments is essentially a muscular Australian B-movie down to the thin characters and boilerplate dialogue. And like most B-movies its better at showing than telling.The location is the Esaala cave complex in Papua New Guinea one of the last unexplored places on earth were told. (So unexplored that the movie was shot on sets and exteriors in Queensland.) Grizzled explorer Frank (Richard Roxburgh) is leading a team through the caverns most of them underwater in hopes of finding an exit through to the sea. When the monsoon season comes early and a boulder plugs their means of exit Frank and four others have to head down in the hopes of ultimately heading up.Those others include Franks teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) a talented cave diver who has abandonment issues with dad; Franks callow partner Carl (Ioan Gruffudd bringing the films only star wattage); Carls hardy girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson in the designated babe role); and jack-of-all-trades George (Dan Wylie) still suffering from the aftereffects of the bends during an earlier dive. After the initial set-up and crisis ""Sanctum settles in for an extended game of Five Little Spelunkers.Characters are dispatched by drowning impalement by stalagmite (or is that stalactite?) and in one grisly sequence after hanging by an ear above a roiling flood. About all thats missing here are mutant cave-dwelling cannibals a la the horror movie ""Descent -- but one of the characters makes up for that by going psycho in the unconvincing final act.The script by John Garvin and Andrew Wight (based on an experience of Wights apparently) manages to turn real peril into dud dialogue and Alister Griersons sturdy direction lacks the personality that keeps a gruel-a-thon like ""127 Hours moving along. What we get are three-dimensional caves and two-dimensional characters.At times thats enough. A sequence where the cast has to squeeze through a narrow underwater passage has the audience holding its breath in suspense and the final scenes in which one of the heroes sucks air from bubbles trapped on the cave roof is nerve-wracking and inspiring. The 3-D technology though is still only good enough to give us a fake sense of depth and some of the shots are visually jarring.Other moments do convey a genuine sensation of space expanding past the edges of vision into inky blackness. Still a rocky cave is a rocky cave and ""Sanctum trades theriotous color palette of ""Avatar for a dull oppressive brown that leaves us feeling as trapped as the characters -- and to less purpose.

"Sanctum (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Sanctum (R) Bad acting and writing sink this underwater 3D thriller Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald2/3/2011 Editor rating 2 The scariest thing about the caving-expedition-gone-wrong thriller Sanctum is that its loosely based on a true story. In 1988 writer/producer Andrew Wight a well-known caver led an expedition into a remote cave system under the Nullarbor Plain in Australia. A freak storm collapsed the entrance and trapped 15 people. Happily they survived with a better success rate than the unlucky explorers in Sanctum who are similarly trapped by flooding from a massive storm and subsequently fall prey to gruesome accidents poor decision-making murderous rage some seriously laughable acting hilarious dialogue and a burdensome back story of father-son discord so heavy handed it could drag down the most light-hearted of plots. And Sanctums plot is anything but effervescent. Cave explorer/diver extraordinaire Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) has set out to chart a huge mysterious underground system in the South Pacific. Along for the ride in addition to Franks nameless crew members are the adventure-junkie financier Carl (Ioan Gruffudd); Carls girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson) an Everest climber who gets a little whiny; George (Dan Wyllie) Franks right-hand man who at one point has to dive even though hes been laid low by the bends and Franks teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) a talented climber who resents his fathers bossy ways even though Dad seems to be the only guy who knows what hes doing. But when disaster strikes Josh (and everybody else) must rely on gruff Franks expertise. Sanctums biggest claim to fame of course is that it was filmed in Queensland Australia with the photographic system executive producer James Cameron used in Avatar which allegedly delivers flawless IMAX projection in 3-D. The underwater photography can be stunning -- the image of a body that floats eerily in the glow from a decompression chamber to which it is tied lingers longer than youd like -- but even so the 3-D is largely wasted here as it usually is these days. The bigger problem with the film which is genuinely unnerving at times is what happens when the cavers are not in immediate peril because they talk. They say ""What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?"" and ""Carl likes to play by his own rules"" and ""Theres no God down here"" and my favorite ""Pains the vulture that sits on your shoulder."" That vulture was certainly digging its talons into my back every time anybody opened his or her mouth. But despite its B-movie flaws Sanctum still manages to exude a claustrophobic terror; by the time it is winding down you want out of these caves as badly as the weary protagonists do. The action scenes are sometimes horrifying enough to make you gasp aloud. If only the rest of the film were similarly breathtaking. Cast Richard Roxburgh Ioan Gruffudd Rhys Wakefield Alice Parkinson.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The 3D thriller Sanctum was vaguely inspired by a 1988 flood that trapped co-writer Andrew Wight and 13 other divers in a cave. But no one would ever mistake the film for a true history From start to finish its a rigidly formulaic disaster picture melded with the form of a coming-of-age story. Theres the quick introduction to the players their relationships and the layout of the gigantic partially unexplored partially underwater cave system theyre exploring. Theres plenty of foreshadowing and faux-offhanded introduction of information and elements that will--surprise--become crucial later on. Theres an early crisis that lets everyone show their true colors and a major crisis that traps them together in the cave system with the goal of finding their way down to the sea in order to survive. And then there are deaths polarizing conflicts over decisions terrifying life-or-death struggles and catharsis all doled out at intervals as precise as the steps to a familiar dance. Still while Sanctum is frustratingly familiar its easy to get caught up in the action. Produced by James Cameron and filmed via the same proprietary 3D camera system he used for Avatar its full of stomach-clenching settings from vertiginous drop-offs to claustrophobic squeezes. Once the story enters the cave the film is often Disney-documentary beautiful. The focus on the limits of the human body and the obduracy of stone and sea is unbeatably visceral and Australian director Alister Grierson lets viewers feel the oppressive potential lethality in every slippery surface sharp edge steep drop or wave of freezing water. Whenever the peril level drops though Sanctum feels pro forma. Rhys Wakefield stars as the reluctant sulky 17-year-old son of Richard Roxburgh a gruff world-class cave-diver with little interest in the surface world. When the two reunite in a Papua New Guinea cave complex along with Roxburghs ultra-rich thrill-seeking boss Ioan Gruffudd and various other employees and partners Wakefield and Roxburgh bark at each other just enough to establish a long-held mutual resentment that can be satisfyingly reversed when the going gets rough. The disaster-movie formula is flexible enough to leave some question open about who will survive at the end and the filmmakers make every death hurt and every survival a relief. If only the rest of the story was as hard to predict or as emotionally involving.

So youd be forgiven for inferring -- as you are damn well expected to -- that the Avatar auteur had something very important to do with Sanctum and that the movie will build on Camerons fascination with the mysteries and terrors of dark waters that dates back to his first feature Piranha Part II The Spawning blossomed in The Abyss made him a mint in Titanic and was further explored in his marine documentaries Expedition Bismarck Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep. In fact Cameron served only as executive producer of Sanctum which was produced and cowritten by his diving buddy and Bismarck colleague Andrew Wight. Cameron is not the big fish in charge just bait for the mass audience. As he Tweeted from a junket last week ""Right now its a Sanctum promotion (Im such a ho)."" Doing a favor for a friend by lending him your world-famous name can be an act of loyalty not of prostitution. Further Sanctum should thrum with action-film tension its based on the true story of Wights 1988 expedition into a remote cave system where a sudden storm sealed off the entrance and 15 people were trapped deep underground amid craggy tunnels and perilous waters with no option but to keep going lower in hopes of finding the source of a river that might carry them to safety. As the ads tease ""The only way out is down."" Wight also assembled a talented if not especially renowned cast including Richard Roxburgh (the sneering count who preys on Nicole Kidman in Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge) as Frank the dive leader and Ioan Gruffudd (the crusading abolitionist in Amazing Grace and Tony Blair in Oliver Stones W.) as Carl the expeditions American financier. Alas all for nothing. Sanctum is a stinker a horror movie without a visible monster a deep dive into shallow characters who bray at one another in a harsh English-based dialect Im told is Australian. Under the heavy hand of director Alister Grierson the dynamics and technique of survival are reduced to a lot of carping between the no-nonsense good-guy Aussies and the venal treacherous Americans. Worse yet the film using the 3-D technology that helped make Avatar such a gorgeous experience lacks visual grandeur. The wonder of caving is expressed in the line ""Where else can you shine a light where no humans been before?"" and we do catch glimpses of mammoth cave naves that might be as glorious as the interior of the Chartres cathedral; but the lights the divers brought are not nearly strong enough to illuminate the spectacle. What you get is mostly dark and all wet. For months Frank has done preliminary exploration of the Esaala caves in Papua New Guinea. Now comes the real thing. His crew includes his teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) from whom hes long been estranged; old hands Crazy George (Dan Wyllie) and Judes (Allison Cratchley); and Carl whos brought along his girlfriend Victoria (luscious Alice Parkinson) inexperienced in cave diving. Down they climb through narrow crevices and onward they swim -- not to enjoy the view but to save their lives. In many particulars the film is similar to the 1951 sci-fi B movie Unknown World about a team of scientists who journey a thousand miles below the surface to find a new home for humans fearful of The Bomb. But the explorers in Sanctum have no life-saving goal scientific curiosity or really interest in documenting this virgin terrain. Theyre there ""because its there"" as Edmund Hillary said of reaching the top of Everest. He went up; theyre going down -- into the dank nadir of their psyches where ""Panics the vulture that sits on your shoulder. (VIDEO TIMEs 10 Questions interview with James Cameron.) That vulture makes numerous appearances as the unwary or unworthy are killed off by drowning euthanasia suicide or misadventure. Its as if the bad karma of James Francos hiker in 127 Hours were infecting the entire group and the only mystery is whos going to get it next. (In the event the film is based on all 15 cavers survived.) Halfway through youll realize that all these deaths are a device to bring Frank and Josh together in a father-and-child reunion; by the end they have no one else to harangue or hug. The movie has one decent scene Josh separated from his company is trapped in a cave flooded to the top and must catch crucial breaths by sucking the air from small pockets in the cave ceiling.

"Sanctum | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sanctum ) Sanctum (United States/Australia 2010) February 03 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres something about an effective ""man versus nature"" film that gets the blood pumping. Maybe its because the situation is often more dire than in a traditional thriller or perhaps itas the sheer implacability of the adversary but the difficulties associated with simple survival in impossible circumstances can provide fodder for an involving motion picture. Such is the case with Sanctum in which the race to outpace rising waters in underground caverns and perform dangerous climbs over slippery rocks outweigh the various clichA(c)s evident in character development. Although its true that a father/son relationship lies at Sanctums emotional core the movie is at its best when it highlights the defiance of the protagonists to yield to despair and give up. Sanctum is loosely based on an experience of co-screenwriter Andrew Wight although the details have been amplified to fit the movie experience. Its about the survival struggle of five characters who become trapped by a flood deep beneath the earth in New Guineas Esa-ala caves while exploring deep underwater pockets and trenches. They are master cave explorer Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh); his estranged 17-year old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield); and his longtime partner George (Dan Wyllie). Also in the group are the multi-millionaire adventurer funding the exploration Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd) and his mountain climber girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Interpersonal conflicts of which there are many become secondary to finding an escape route before rising waters cut off any chance of cheating death. The strength of the film lies in its ability to wring tension from even seemingly mundane circumstances. After all this is essentially a movie about characters climbing through dark spaces and diving deep under water. Nevertheless the sense of danger and urgency rarely lets up even when the end is (apparently) in sight. Sadly the movies dramatic elements arent as solid. The friction between Frank and Josh never quite escapes from the formulaic bed in which it is consummated; it follows a generic path to a predictable conclusion. Likewise other human interaction - conflict between the grizzled veteran and the inexperienced (but filthy rich) outsider and a less-than-heartfelt love affair - are presented with less than full-bodied passion. They are better than distractions because they add a dash of tragedy when one character or another suffers a debilitating injury or perishes but few will be as impressed by director Alister Griersons command of human drama as by his ability to master the suspenseful intricacies of cave survival. The acting is of variable quality. The two known names in the cast neither of whom has come close to the so-called ""A list"" give the best performances. Richard Roxburgh most recognized internationally as Ewan McGregors rival for Nicole Kidmans heart in Moulin Rouge is effective as the tough-as-nails Frank a man who by his own admission is better off in the caves than in the real world (his son provides less flattering descriptions of him which include the words ""emotionally closed off"" and ""Nazi""). Ioan Gruffudd formerly Reed Richards a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic manages a degree of smug smarminess without overdoing it not quite rising to Paul Reisers level in Aliens. The other principles could be just out of acting school for all they bring to their roles. Because of James Camerons behind-the-scenes involvement and public support of the film the elephant in the room becomes the 3-D. Sanctum was not subjected to a quickie post-production conversion; it was filmed in 3-D and it shows although one might question some of cinematographer Jules OLoughlins choices in shot composition. The 3-D is not perfect - there are repeated instances in which foreground objects become blurry and obtrusive and others in which fast motions can be difficult to follow. The dimness associated with 3-Ds light reduction surprisingly isnt much of a problem since this is intended to be a dark motion picture. In the case of Sanctum 3-D adds depth to the experience. Imperfect though it may be it doesnt feel like the cheap rip-off that has become associated with this filmmaking niche. In terms of visual quality a gulf separates what Sanctum offers from what most 3-D movies foist upon us in pursuit of a surcharge. Camerons name also invokes thoughts of The Abyss which can catalogue a number of similarities to Sanctum (although there are no aliens here). What impressed me about both films is the clarity and seeming simplicity of the underwater footage. From a purely technical standpoint the ability to make an underwater motion picture of this sort in 3-D is worthy of respect. Fortunately the final product is not only technically adept but it represents a fine entry into the ""man versus nature"" adventure category. Its a suspenseful 90-plus minutes whose smattering of deficiencies are outweighed by its positive qualities which include on balance its 3-D.

They think theyre in for some extreme spelunking; we know theyre about to get knocked off one by one as a storm turns the cave into a waterlogged death trap. The extraneous bickering between our teen hero (Rhys Wakefield) and his tyrannical dad (Richard Roxburgh) flops but character development isnt the movies strong point. Momentum is. As we go deeper into the cave walls squeezing water rising the movie has a narrative pull as sure as gravity.

"Pretty 3-D images go down with the script - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Pretty 3-D images go down with the scriptSanctum a 2 starsFebruary 03 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticRichard Roxburgh (left) and Rhys Wakefield star in a scene in the 3D action-thriller ""Sanctum"" from executive producer James Cameron. The film follows a team of underwater cave divers on a treacherous expedition to the largest most beautiful and least accessible cave system on Earth. (Courtesy Universal Pictures)Photographed with the same image-acquisition technology James Cameron used on ""Avatar"" the movie on which we can blame most of the cruddy 3-D films since the new suspense thriller ""Sanctum"" executive-produced by Cameron presents images (underwater generally) of pristine digital clarity without the aggravating dimness of a movie shot in 2-D and then converted in postproduction. So its the high-type 3-D.The characters the dialogue the water-based peril -- the stuff the 3-D is supposed to be supporting in the name of racking our nerves -- well ""Sanctum"" has some problems with those. An Australian production the film contains a tiny kernel of ""based on a true story"" that of a particularly rough underwater caving expedition undertaken by ""Sanctum"" producer and co-writer Andrew Wight whos a rock star in his field and a pal of diving enthusiast Cameron. That risky dangerous 1988 expedition claimed no casualties. Grimmer than ""127 Hours"" this movie is like a remake of ""And Then There Were None"" directed by Jacques Cousteau.To make things odder at heart its a father-son bonding tale. The Ahab-like underwater cave diver Frank played as a human growl by Richard Roxburgh is leading his intrepid crew deep into ""the largest unexplored cave system in the world"" off the coast of New Guinea. A terrible storm gnashes its terrible teeth and communication with the rest of the team is cut off; the caves begin to flood with the divers (including Franks teenage son played by the appealing Rhys Wakefield) unable to use their original point of entry to escape.The premise is strong with ""Sanctum"" and for a while you swim with it. Director Alister Grierson and cinematographer Jules OLoughlin combine location shooting digital effects and a considerable amount of soundstage and water-tank footage. The sets start looking like a high-end water park only when the suspense sequences begin repeating themselves.The writing really is bad in this film and even talented actors such as Ioan Gruffudd (a Welshman faking a generic American dialect) and his fellow adventurer played by Alice Parkinson (Australian faking the same) come off as rank amateurs. Everyone screams and panics and spews cliches constantly whether the context is hubris (""This caves not gonna beat me"") or portents of doom (""This cavell kill you in a heartbeat"") or expositional duhs (""The cave is flooding"") or after the latest round of hypothermia or petty infighting some hard-won advice to Those Who Will Go On To Tell The Story (""Trust the cave and follow the river"").Here and there an image of spectral beauty assisted by the 3-D technology floats into view and captures our imagination. But the script which really shouldve been called ""Sanctimonium"" has a serious case of the bends.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for language some violence and disturbing images)Cast Richard Roxburgh (Frank); Rhys Wakefield (Josh); Alice Parkinson (Victoria); Dan Wyllie (Crazy George); Ioan Gruffudd (Carl)Credits Directed by Alister Grierson; written by John Garvin and Andrew Wight; produced by Wight.

""Trust the cave; follow the river"" warns grizzled diver extraordinaire Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) after a tropical cyclone collapses the joint leaving him to babysit his Bieber-coifed teen son (Rhys Wakefield) a smug and reckless financier (Ioan Gruffudd) and other one-at-a-time expendables as they make their escape swim. Inspired by co-screenwriter and explorer Andrew Wights actual cave-in trauma Sanctum overeagerly crams in every possible survival fiasco from blood-bubbling decompression sickness to ""meat-grinder"" whirlpools equipment failures and mercy drownings. Ultimately the plot-point overload dilutes any palpable sense of dread excitement or empathy and it doesnt help that all the dialogue acts in service to either patronizing exposition or turgid interpersonal drama (Franks kid comes of age after learning his negligent daddy knows poetry and gee can that billionaire blowhard be trusted?). Even the added visual dimension thankfully used more for spatial recognition than splashing at us cant compensate for impersonalized characters stuck under rocks. 127 Hours this aint.

Sanctum Bad Director Alister Grierson. Cast Richard Roxburgh Rhys Wakefield Ioan Gruffudd. Rating R for language violence and disturbing images. Guide to this weeks new releases Spotlight James Cameron Who ever wanted to know that? Whats more who wants to spend a couple of hours in a theater replicating the experience in 3D? If there were some sort of worthwhile dramatic arc to the story of divers trying to escape the harsh realities nature dishes out who knows maybe. But ""Sanctum"" doesnt have that. What it has instead is really bad acting set against often-stunning cave-wall backdrops and underwater action sequences. Naturally James Cameron is the executive producer. But dont blame him for the writing. That dubious distinction goes to John Garvin and Andrew Wight; Alister Grierson directs. Grierson has a certain flair for staging underwater scenes; if something like that is needed in more movies perhaps hes your man. Say this of Grierson He doesnt waste a lot of time with niceties like plot development. Were plunged almost immediately into the depths of the massive underwater Esa-Ala caves in the South Pacific where Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) and his crew have been exploring for months. Frank is joined by his 17-year-old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) and the guy footing the bill for the operation Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd) who brought along his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). An approaching storm hits more quickly than they had anticipated so the divers cant get out in time to escape the walls of water that shut off their exit. So they must tunnel further in hoping to come out on the other side at the ocean armed only with some scuba gear a few flashlights and a boatload of movie-cliche behavior. Frank it seems hasnt been much of a father to Josh. Instead hes been off exploring the caves of the world shirking terrestrial duties. Hes more comfortable underground thinks of it as his church and yes he really says that. You can sense the eventual father-son bonding coming from a long way off. The only question is how many other people are going to have to die to achieve it? Oh you know plenty. But when the characters make such a small impact its hard to get worked up about it. Only Dan Wyllie as Franks loyal assistant generates much interest (and was in the great ""Animal Kingdom"" to boot). Gruffudd has a particularly unfortunate role as the impulsive Hurley though its hard to tell if its the performance or the writing thats so grating. So well go with both. The visuals are often breathtaking the underwater shots otherworldly. As an extreme travelogue ""Sanctum"" is somewhat intriguing. As a movie? Not so much. Better just to sit back and look at the pretty pictures.

The astounding visuals almost overcome the waterlogged emotional drama in ""Sanctum"" a subterranean survival epic that expertly tightens the screws even as one wishes it would keep a tighter mouth-clamp on its increasingly whiny characters. Sure to remind some viewers of ""The Descent"" though it mostly bears the thrill-seeking 3D-loving fingerprints of exec producer James Cameron this often squirmingly visceral thriller offers aquaphobes and claustrophobes one more reason as if they needed it to steer clear of Australias treacherous Esaala Caves. Superb imagery stereoscopic enhancements and Imax showings should give this otherwise midrange-trawling B-movie a commercial shot in the arm. Though directed ably enough by Alister Grierson (""Kokoda"") and loosely based on true events that befell producer Andrew Wight during an actual cave expedition this extremely Down Under adventure cant help but feel pieced together from spare parts of other Cameron-helmed pictures. The abundance of watery mayhem recalls ""The Abyss""; the deep dives and 3D visuals bring to mind his documentaries ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" and ""Aliens of the Deep"" (both also produced by Wight); and like ""Titanic"" ""Sanctum"" kicks off with a nifty computer graphic that provides a visual and scientific context for the thrills and spills to come. Alas the similarities to Camerons body of work also extend to the writing with the result that the caves have far more depth than the characters in John Garvin and Wights script while the dialogue is clunky enough to make one wish more of it had been delivered underwater. Thus Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh effective) a grizzled hardass who has spent months in the Esaala Caves trying to find an elusive underground pipeline to the ocean is described in passing as ""the most respected explorer of our time."" His younger slicker fellow caver Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) at one point takes a reckless swan dive off a cliff spurring someone to point out ""Carl likes to play by his own rules."" And so he does especially when a flash flood seals off the cave exit and traps the two men underground with Franks neglected pretty-boy son Josh (Rhys Wakefield); Carls pretty and pretty useless g.f. Victoria (Alice Parkinson); and the unpromisingly named Crazy George (Dan Wyllie). The key to enjoying ""Sanctum"" is to look not listen. Early on Jules OLoughlins 3D camera prowls the cavern interiors in mostly unbroken takes allowing viewers to orient themselves within the space alongside the characters (blown up in Imax the feel is even more immersive). Attention has been paid to every detail of Nicholas McCallums production design particularly the lights coruscating off the pools surface and bouncing around the cavern walls. And when Frank and another diver (Allison Cratchley) swim into what looks like a magnificent sunken cathedral (beautifully lensed by underwater d.p. Simon Christidis) the film allows us to register a moment of genuine awe before terror sets in. For impressive stretches the terror is just as genuine. Like ""The Descent"" but minus the gollums ""Sanctum"" induces an unnerving sense of claustrophobia through formal resourcefulness alone -- limited light sources confined spaces the painful scrape of bodies against rock in Paul Pirolas meticulous sound design. Gory moments occasionally cross over into sadism but thats par for the course with this sort of clash between man and nature. More problematically the struggle-for-survival premise is so elemental that the tacked-on character conflicts feel even more banal and screechy as the body count rises Will Frank and Josh patch up their father-son issues? Is Carl not as trustworthy as he appears? Is Victoria really stupid enough not to wear a wetsuit? As one would expect from a Cameron-produced film the 3D is used in an atmospheric rather than obtrusive manner subtly accentuating the depths and contours of the cave. Pic was shot primarily off the Gold Coast and in caves around South Australia.

"Movie Review ""Sanctum"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Hall Pass"" Movie Review ""Quartet"" - Movie Review ""Sanctum"" Posted on January 22 2013      by rogerinorlando Beautifully back-lit bodies are suspended in water and suspended from the 3D screen in ""Sanctum"" the new trapped-in-a-cave thriller that James Cameron produced as a way of showing off his love of all things underwater. Its a solid old-fashioned action yarn filled with the very latest dive gear and the oldest plot formula in the movie-makers playbook. Set deep underground in the Esa Ala ""caving district"" of Papua New Guinea its a ""Ten Little Indians"" story of a handful of explorers -- some experienced some novices -- trapped underground when a cyclone floods ""the largest unexplored cave system in the world."" There are two central conflicts. Team leader Frank (Aussie actor Richard Roxburgh in full growl) is the hardened veteran cave explorer whose son Josh (Aussie newcomer Rhys Wakefield) is in full rebellion against dads chosen profession and his place in it. ""Its a sphincter of rocks"" he pouts. ""NOBODY cares"" Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) cares. Hes underwriting this expedition ready to slap his name on places that ""since the beginning of time no human being has ever seen."" Hes readier to take risks than Frank is and thats the second major conflict set up here. Carls dragged his mountaineering girlfriend (Alice Parkinson) down the huge hole with him. Then theres Franks old diving mate George (Dan Wyllie) an expert on ""the bends"" -- ""Your bloods gonna fizz up like a dropped cano beer."" And also along Franks longtime aboriginal colleague Luko (Cramer Cain). In the first act we see how even when all the hi-tech is working something terrible can go wrong when youre squeezing through underwater tunnels with bulky dive gear on. Director Alistir Grierson has seen Camerons earliest underwater thriller ""The Abyss."" He knows theres nothing more traumatic than watching someone panic and suffocate right in front of you. The 3D makes that first death all the more traumatic. Then the rains come and those five other folks are trapped below with only Frank ""the most determined cave diver in the world"" to get them out. Franks leadership consists of barking ""You can do this because you have to do this"" and ""This cavell kill you in a heartbeat."" In true ""Ten Little Indians"" (an Agatha Christie story that set this formula in stone) fashion the object of ""Sanctum"" is to make us wonder who will live and who will die next? The movie inspired by a real life experience of Australian co-writer explorer and Cameron consultant-pal Andrew Wight is dully predictable with touching moments of noble sacrifice and cliched scenes of rank cowardice. But the filmmakers make its stock-in-trade situations visually arresting. Lacking supernatural elements sex and over-the-top gore ""Sanctum"" would have played better as a PG-13 picture. Gratuitous profanity doesnt add edge to the Cameronesque tough-guy dialogue. And since you can figure out where its going long before our divers do it seems too long. But ""Sanctum"" does take us somewhere alien it not exactly as dazzling as Pandora. And as a movie it performs according to spec allowing its producer to further perfect the gear and techniques that he is almost certain to turn lose on ""Avatar 2 and 3"" somewhere down the watery road. See for Yourself ""Sanctum"" Cast Rick Roxburgh Ioan Gruffudd Alice Parkinson  Rhys Wakefield Director Alister Grierson Running time  1 hour 49 minutes Rating R for language some violence and disturbing images.

However none of the unremarkable underwater sequences were actually shot that way - just those featuring cathedral-like caves claustrophobic crevices and labyrinthine tunnels all of which look like the studio sets they obviously are. Trapped underground by a tropical storm and the resulting flood water grizzled cave-diving veteran Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) his resentful 17-year-old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) and reckless financier Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffud) eke out the dwindling food and failing light while a string of supporting characters meet predictable watery ends. Joshs maudlin voiceover marks this out as a sentimental rites-of-passage tale and even in this dim light one can see every plot development coming a mile off.
