"Knowing Not to Go Is Half the Battle -- On G.I. Joe Retaliation << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Knowing Not to Go Is Half the Battle -- On G.I. Joe Retaliation Paramount Channing Tatum March 28 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Did you think a second G.I. Joe movie was a good idea? It wasnt simply that the first one -- taken from action figures and an after-school cartoon series -- was nap-inducing (although at least in my seat naps were had). G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra starred Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum cost 175 million to make and was kind of the Huey Lewis and the News of hit blockbusters. It made more than 302 million globally and yet it was hard to find anyone happy they stayed for the whole thing. G.I. Joe Retaliation was supposed to happen last summer but was pushed back until today. The stated reason was a lot of blah-blah-blah about an unfinished 3-D conversion. But its likely someone at Paramount noticed that in the three years since The Rise of Cobra Tatum has turned from a pile of wood into a piece of popular furniture Hes the star equivalent of IKEAs Expedit bookshelf -- basic reliable almost everywhere and assembly still required. His stardom explains why the first 20 or so minutes of Retaliation are pretty good and the 90 minutes that follow are not. Its as if Tatum wasnt supposed to be in this movie and was added to juice up a mess. Tatums still Duke and Dwayne Johnson enters the series as Roadblock and the movie seems to enjoy the bromantic comedy coursing between them. All they do is hang out and tease each other -- inside the North Korean demilitarized zone playing a video game at Roadblocks apartment somewhere in the Indus River Valley. Tatum mumbles some of his lines and throws the rest away. Hes not perfect Reciting exposition still makes him sound sub-literate. But he and Johnson are good together and around them the movie has a loose enjoyably random rhythm. If the whole thing were edited as unpredictably as those opening minutes this could be 21 Jump Street or a Bad Boys movie. That Retaliation cares more about their chemistry than cheap-looking explosions and poorly staged shootouts implies that the director (Jon M. Chu) wants to distract us from the assembly-line chintz he has on his hands. And yet the movie suddenly and cynically focuses on a plot involving a kidnapped United States president (Jonathan Pryce); his evil impostor (Pryce again); the impostors pal Cobra Commander (some dude in a mirror mask); and a scheme to see the planet go up in nuclear smoke. Meanwhile Roadblock and some other Joes -- including Flint (D.J. Cotrona) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and the silent-but-deadly Snake Eyes (Ray Park) -- destroy a lot of property and logic in the name of spoiling Cobras plan. Half a world away embarrassment awaits in a Shaolin-style temple in which a blind and grizzled RZA narrates martial-arts Joe training and a lethal conjure-woman demonstrates her skills at tissue reconstruction and wearing Toni Morrisons hair. There is a lovely rappel-and-fight sequence set amid lots of cliffs and digital-seeming rock face. Some of the wonder of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon exists in the aerials of these chases. But so does the urge to scream ""Finish him"" as stuntmen are kicked or chopped to their deaths. In Lady Jaye Retaliation gives us a character who decries chauvinism but happily uses her booty and boobies to ensnare men. In Flint it gives us an excruciating reminder of what an inanimate object Tatum used to be. In Roadblock were given an example of how Johnsons brand is diluted by his willingness to say yes to the first thing that puts him in a T-shirt and Kevlar. Its great that hes back doing movies (hell have had one a month by May). But at the moment hes more imposing when hes on Monday Night Raw. He should be starring in Olympus Has Fallen and Gerard Butler should be heading this up -- his macho-cheesiness would be perfect here. By the time Bruce Willis arrives as the original G.I. Joe and a military messiah whose war-arsenal PIN is ""1-7-7-6"" were given self-congratulation thats too brain-dead to know that its farce. I know what youre thinking You just paid 6 to 12 to see the same nonsense last weekend. And youre not wrong. Paramount is selling us a Channing Tatum-Dwayne Johnson blow-em-up but delivering bootleg Olympus instead. Retaliation has fewer jawlines and worse American accents (the U.K.s Ray Stevenson plays a villainous Southerner named Firefly; hes like watching a Humvee audition for Steel Magnolias). The Joe movie makes even less ideological and circumstantial sense than Olympus. I mean is staging a massive gun battle near two gentlemen carrying a warhead really a good idea? But these movies (along with Roland Emmerichs upcoming and delicious-looking work of disaster White House Down -- with Jamie Foxx and yes Channing Tatum) do tap into this skepticism about homeland security and foreign policy in the Obama era. These movies arent about actual terrorism so much as they are fantasies about the consequences of a perceived lack of muscle in his leadership. It doesnt matter that more or less hes ""the motherfucker who caught bin Laden"" if he cant defend his home. In all three films servicemen come to POTUSs rescue. Theres no ""get off my plane"" moment for him. The White House assault movie has an extremist-libertarian appeal too. If government is too big and too Big Brother-y for you blowing some of it to smithereens is one way to shrink it. Its true that a lack of feasible politics make Olympus Has Fallen and G.I. Joe Retaliation laughable. But in making the president a distressed damsel they suggest a fear that the White House is there for the enemys taking even if that enemy started life as a Hasbro toy.

Chu Written by Rhett Reese Paul Wernick Starring Bruce Willis Channing Tatum Duane (The Rock) Johnson Classification PG Genre thriller Year 2013 Country USA Language English What a blast G.I. Joe Retaliation is And then another blast and another in a series of concussive jolts that shred any conventional sense of story as thoroughly as anything since the last Michael Bay film. This sequel/reboot to 2009s G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra based on the Hasbro plastic soldiers and the spinoff comic-book series feels like a five-year-old with a megaphone excitedly yelling about his latest bulldozer-soldier-dinosaur smash-kill-squash-everything game. Multimedia G.I. Joe Retaliation The official trailer Actor Bradley Cooper arrives at a special screening of his new movie ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in Beverly Hills California November 19 2012 Reuters video Video Bradley Cooper passes Sexiest Man mantle to Channing Tatum G.I. Joe Retaliation is really a bloated version of its trailer featuring a series of set-piece action sequences with bulging muscles and weapons from nunchucks to nuclear warheads. Director Jon M. Chu (who directed the Step Up dance movies and Justin Biebers concert film) introduces characters and exposition briskly between the action montages of slice-and-dice editing whip pan and slow-motion camera work. All of this shows a merry disregard for the conventions of space and time as we leap about from Korea to Pakistan Washington Nepal Tokyo and Germany most of which look like warehouse sets bolstered by CGI backdrops. And all of course in 3-D so we can immerse ourselves in the ammo blasts.Most of the fights are between the good guys (a commando group called G.I. Joes) and the bad guys (Cobra) and everyone has special skills just shy of Avengers-level superhero abilities. One of Cobras big assets is that they have a fake president of the United States named Zartan (Jonathan Pryce) who has the real president (Jonathan Pryce again) held captive and tortured by various means including barbaric puns. (""They call it a water board - but Im never bored."")The evil fake president causes the G.I. Joes to get ambushed and framed for the assassination of the Pakistani president. Among the survivors are Duke (Channing Tatum) who has a sensitive pout Roadblock (Duane Johnson) who has big biceps and an ironic right eyebrow and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) who has superior analytic skills and to distract the enemies breasts. Finally the Joes recruit gun-nut General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis in a cameo) who provides wisecracks and more bald badness.On the evil side things are even more chaotic. Sleek martial-arts whiz Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and a Southern tough guy named Firefly (Ray Stevenson) who throws mechanical exploding firelies rescue the growly voiced Cobra Commander in a Darth Vader mask (Luke Bracey). Then Storm Shadow heads home to the Himalayas to recover from his wounds and is kidnapped by a team of ninjas who take him to Tokyo in a body bag. Afterwards Storm Shadow and a female character in a skin-tight body suit Jinx (Elodie Yung) decide to join the G.I. Joes to defeat the fake president Zartan.In the end all the leaders of the free world are at a summit where they have video-game controllers to blow up the world in the guise of destroying their nuclear arsenals and Zartan is playing Angry Birds on his phone and mocking them. Unfortunately London gets destroyed (poop happens as they say in the military) though otherwise things end well with lots of awards and salutes all around and enough narrative loose ends for another sequel or 12.But now its time to stop because Daddy has a major 3-D headache and I think its time to tuck the G.I. Joes back in their bunker and think hard about what happens when everyone gets too excited. In the morning the G.I. Joes and Cobra can tell London theyre very sorry for what they did even if Im not quite sure what it was. Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story G.I.

Joes those patriotic men (and women) of military might only think theyve defeated Team Cobra. Unfortunately our commander-in-chief (Jonathan Pryce) has been replaced by one of the nefarious villains top operatives and hes set a plan in motion to drop nukes on several bustling metropolises. Only Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) and his ragtag team of rogue Joes--which includes the heroic organizations forcibly retired founding member (Bruce Willis)--can prevent global destruction. This bombastic post-converted 3-D sequel to G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra (2009) plays like a tiresomely extended evening of channel surfing. Only an impressive action set-piece on a mountainside as well as some WTF cameos by the RZA and James Carville possesses anything close to the wit and energy director Jon M. Chu brought to his two Step Up movies.

His valiant companera the foxy Jinx (Elodie Yung) is having trouble fighting off the onslaught when an unexpected ally arrives Storm Shadows old rival Snake Eyes (Ray Park). Hand-to-hand or sword-to-sword Snake Eyes and Jinx engage the invaders in frenetic Shaw Brothers martial-arts style proving that a dozen men cant contain one pretty woman and that bullets are no match for a Hasbro Masters saber. Thats just the overture to an amazing action sequence midway through G.I. Joe Retaliation. Toting Storm Shadow in a body bag Snake Eyes and Jinx escape the high fortress on cables with the Commanders Ninjas in fierce pursuit. A half-mile above sea level they whoosh between Himalayan peaks rappel up the steep face of a mountain and dodge 3-D gunfire until they wipe out their foes and reach safety. These few minutes give audiences an exhilarating trip full of the snazziest stunt work that modern Hollywood or old Hong Kong could offer; and it has little to do with the central story line. Its just a bonus a fabulous throw-in that expert filmmakers put together because it seemed impossible to achieve and they could do it. (READ Find Hasbros G.I. Joe as one of the all-TIME 100 Greatest Toys) The second live-action movie episode based on the Hasbro toys the Marvel comics and the 1980s TV cartoon series Retaliation follows G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra. Released without press screenings in the summer of 2009 Rise survived the belated contempt of critics to earn 300 million worldwide -- a hefty number that barely covered the films 175-million production budget plus marketing costs. Undaunted Paramount went ahead with a G.I. Joe sequel pegged to hit theaters last June. But when Battleship another expensive action picture based on a Hasbro toy bombed at the domestic box office the studio shelved Retaliation until now ostensibly to convert the movie to 3-D. Demoting an expensive action picture from a prime summer slot one year to Easter weekend the next suggests little faith in the merchandise. Audiences were left pondering the imponderable Could the second film actually be lamer than the first? Au contraire -- for Retaliation is less a sequel than an antidote to the calcified mound of crap that ostensibly inspired it. In fact sequel is hardly the word for a movie that junks many of Cobras characters flies off on tangents familiar only to acolytes of the Joe canon and tucks in tropes from the mythology of nearly every other superhero including Batman and James Bond. Retaliation also enlists Dwayne Johnson Hollywoods premier action enforcer for its starring role and finds room for Bruce Willis as the original G.I. Joe to strut his veteran machismo. Two movie studs eye each other warily across the generations then exchange the grim grin of comrades and get to work. (READ Corlisss review of G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra) The big difference though is the blithe fun that Retaliation embodies and communicates. No cinema masterpiece this is an assured example of popular moviemaking -- junk food with the expected carbs and a savory taste. For this we credit director Jon M. Chu; his background in putting dance on screen (two of the Step Up sequels and TVs The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers) could account for the grace both of the action set pieces and of the supple prowling camera even in closeups. The script also has more wit and a higher tolerance for geopolitical impudence than a sequel requires or may need. No surprise since the writers are Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick whose screenplay for Zombieland had exactly those tonic subversive qualities. Kudos as well to stunt coordinator Steve Ritzi and fight coordinator Thomas DuPont for rescuing the physical action from the CGI wizards and giving it some old-fashioned kick. (SEE Corlisss review of Zombieland) All you have to know about the first movie are that Channing Tatum played Duke the lead Joe and that it ended with Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) the main mercenary of Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) being installed through nanomite technology as the President of the United States (impersonated by Jonathan Pryce as Joe Biden with a mean streak). Retaliation allows Duke and his best buddy Roadblock (Johnson) a few scenes of homoerotic bonding -- competing at video games and target practice while joking about each others panties and the prospect of an all-night sing-along session with Roadblocks two kids -- before Duke falls victim to a fate worse than karaoke. Tatum disappears for now though theoretically available for a G.I. Joe Resurrection; and Johnson inherits the hero role. A Cobra strike eradicates most of the Joes stationed in Pakistans Indus Valley leaving just three survivors -- Roadblock Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) -- who have dived into a deep well; they escape by crushing themselves into a six-legged Star of David formation that scales the narrow circular walls. (Last summer in The Dark Knight Rises Bruce Wayne took a half-hour of screen time to manage a solo escape that the Joes teamwork accomplishes in less than a minute.) Falsely proclaimed enemies of the state headed by the Zartan-President the trio must sneak back to Washington find the captive real Prez unmask the evil fraud and defeat Cobra Commanders wholly-owned Armageddon subsidiary the Zeus Industrial Complex. In the B-story Storm Shadow has infiltrated an underground prison to free Cobra Commander -- his confederate before the Himalayan hit -- and the prime Cobra bruiser Firefly (Ray Stevenson) whos here mainly to exchange killer punches with Roadblock. (READ Corlisss review of The Dark Knight Rises) While the action figures pummel one another and flesh-seeking bullets buzz toward their targets like homicidal houseflies and the Vader-like Commander exhales threats of comic-book grandiosity (""Soon the world will cower in the face of Zeus"") Zartan revels in his malefic power. Forget last weeks White House Doomsday fantasy Olympus Has Fallen with North Korea invading the Presidents residence. In Retaliation the bad guy has already assumed power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and hes loving it. In public he solemnly indicts the Joes for treason by citing the Pogo comic strip (""We have met the enemy and he is us""); in private he quotes a Bounty commercial (""I get to blow stuff up -- Im the quicker blower-upper""). A mad genius who seemingly aspires to be Comic-in-Chief President Zartan purrs ""They call it waterboarding but I never get bored"" like a kid who decapitates toy soldiers just for the fun of it. Somehow convincing the heads of all the nuclear nations including North Korea to show up at Fort Sumter for a no-nukes conference the Evil Prez announces that he has Death Star weapons hovering over each nations capital poised for a bigger better Hiroshima. (His pin number for these awful devices 1776.) Unless they accede to his whims millions will die he points out adding cheerfully ""The good news is No global warming summit next month."" (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Sequels Better Than the Originals) Politically puckish or make that reckless the script winks at the annihilation of U.S. soldiers in Pakistan at the notion of a U.S. President as the nonhuman secret agent of a foreign power and at the nuclear cratering of London -- bye-bye Parliament; toodle-pip Ferris wheel -- which one-ups Cobras biochemical blitz of Paris. Retaliation also raised cheers from members of a preview audience when they saw that the suburban home of Williss General Joseph Colton conceals more heavy artillery than the fallout shelter of Wayne LaPierres dreams. So silkily and insistently does the movie promote its destroy-the-world schemes that when the Evil Prez goes on TV to accuse the Joes of plotting to steal Pakistans nuclear weapons even a peacenik may briefly think that thats not such a crazy idea. Before the liberal in me rails overmuch against the arrant blood lust of action films or condemns Hasbros toys and tanks as a starter set for the NRA lunatic fringe the movie critic in me must intervene. Nobody among these filmmakers or in the mass audience takes fictional violence any more seriously in action-adventures than they did for 70 years of Westerns -- when a shoot-out routinely resolved all differences -- or for decades of Bond films and superhero movies when the world was always a hairbreadth from the Rapture. Any potential impact on deranged minds is almost irrelevant in the cartoonish PG-13 Retaliation which pirouettes between straight-faced comic-book archetype and jaunty parody. (Please any crazy people out there dont go on a shooting rampage this weekend. Or ever.) (READ Corliss on the relation of pop culture to Columbine Va. Tech and Aurora) The two poles of the movies tone can be seen in the performances of Lee the lithe sleekly contoured star of such Korean films as I Saw the Devil and The Good the Bad the Weird and Walton Goggins formerly of The Shield as the warden who holds Cobra Commander in a prison so deep ""its in international jurisdiction."" Lee is all business Goggins all pleasure. A sort of subterranean Pryce the warden truly enjoys his work addressing Storm Shadows intrusion by saying ""Welcome to Hell"" and confessing hes a longtime fan of the Ninjas work. His appearance is curtailed but while hes on screen Goggins radiates a connoisseurship of evil. As Martha Stewart might say being bad is a good thing. Off-screen and beyond Retaliations myriad story threads is another odd Hollywood plot Dwayne Johnsons mission to infiltrate franchises -- to extend and often improve them. Back when he was The Rock he made his movie-acting debut in The Mummy Returns as the giant marauding insect who was spun off as an ancient Egyptian rebel hero in The Scorpion King. In 2011 he showed up as Vin Diesels nemesis-turned-abettor in Fast Five the most enjoyable of the Fast and the Furious movies and will be back in this summers Fast amp; Furious 6. Last year he replaced Brendan Fraser in Journey 2 The Mysterious Island a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth; he is now at work on another installment. Johnson also has fronted more than his share of remakes Walking Tall Gridiron Gang and Escape to Witch Mountain. (READ Mary Pols on Dwayne Johnson in Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) Hes massively muscled and plays characters with finely honed killer instincts. Yet Johnson projects a gentle generous soul expressed through one of the most beautiful faces in movies. The villain of The Mummy Returns morphed into the hero of The Scorpion King because producers recognized the attractive disposition inside the stolid elaborately tattooed frame. An action figure with a sweet core Johnson can pump up the humanity of any franchise whether hes playing a stepdad who becomes a hero in Journey 2 or as here a stud soldier who treats Flint and Jaye like his grown children and shepherds them through peril. Following those younger Joes the Retaliation audience is encouraged to clamber up on Johnsons huge soldiers and go along for a pretty cool ride.

Joe Retaliation - Dear Lord Dont Let Me Die Tonight Dear Lord Dont Let Me Die Tonight Credit Paramount Pictures Whats the difference between an action figure and an action star? Very little in G.I. Joe Retaliation which features no performances of note even from such combat-tested thespians as Bruce Willis Jonathan Pryce and Dwayne Johnson. The sequel to 2009s G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra the latest Joe is a near-surrealistic mashup of serious themes and juvenile humor realistic locations and cheesy CGI. Adapted to 3-D after it was shot the movie is also one of the most aggressive examples ever of the chucking-stuff-at-the-viewer aesthetic. Retaliation continues the plot of its predecessor while cashiering most of its cast. Thats not especially disruptive to continuity since many of the characters wear masks and/or speak little if at all. The Darth Vader-ish role of Cobra Commander requires two performers -- one for the body and another for the voice -- but might as well be played by a PVC doll with a handful of ball-and-socket joints. Early scenes establish the personal chemistry of Channing Tatums Duke and Johnsons Block -- short for ""Roadblock"" oddly enough not ""Blockhead."" When not killing people the two engage in the sort of youre-a-girl-no-you-are taunts that action-flick makers seem to think are manly. Then the movie dispatches the Joes to Pakistan where most of them are uh sidelined. Only Block Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and some other guy (D.J. Cotrona) remain active although it turns out that the super-soldiers still have a few friends left in Tokyo D.C. and other exotic climes that are mostly impersonated by digital pixels or Louisiana. Snake Eyes (Ray Park) Jinx (Elodie Yung) and Blind Master (rapper RZA) offer their assistance. Theres also an ambiguous role for Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and a return to the field for retired Gen. Joseph Colton (Willis) who does fire off one decent aging-warrior quip. The Joes as might be guessed are still battling Cobra a cabal that does bad stuff. The groups disguise master Zartan has assumed the identity of the U.S. president (an unchallenging dual role for Pryce) and Cobra is using this clandestine takeover to provoke global war. i An unnamed U.S. president (thats how much the filmmakers care) is kidnapped by a master of disguise (played like the president by Jonathan Pryce) who assumes his place and initiates an ... oh like it matters. Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures An unnamed U.S. president (thats how much the filmmakers care) is kidnapped by a master of disguise (played like the president by Jonathan Pryce) who assumes his place and initiates an ... oh like it matters. Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures The scenario scripted by Zombielands Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick overlaps oddly with that of last weeks equally silly Olympus Has Fallen. Both involve North Korea potential nuclear Armageddon and a president held hostage in a bunker beneath his home. But Retaliation traps the prez in his own White House-like manse somewhere in Virginia as if to admit that simulating the real presidential abode is beyond the filmmakers abilities. And so the movie proceeds nestling a phony-looking Tibetan monastery amid actual mountains and staging an absurd nuclear-disarmament conference at what looks like the genuine Fort Sumter. (The symbolism of that location remains inscrutable but must mean something to someone involved in the production.) First-time G.I. Joe director Jon M. Chu who supervised a pair of those Step Up teen-dance movies rarely trusts his actors to sustain an action sequence. Hand-to-hand combat is supplemented by various high-tech devices that recall the Transformers movies -- another toy-derived franchise. Ninja-like warriors swoop impossibly through the Himalayas battling in midair while bombs swords and even about-to-be-dead bodies fly at the audience. The latter may not be the most tasteless thing in a movie that features a waterboarding joke. But the abundance of projectiles could make innocent bystanders wish that Block would live up to his name and obstruct some of the crud flying off the screen.

Joe Retaliation."" Credit Paramount Pictures A couple of surprises await fans of ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" a follow-up to the 2009 moneymaker ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra.""Those surprises will not be spoiled here because this being yet another film inspired by a Hasbro toy the movies other main attributes are noise and heavy weaponry.In this adventure the G.I. Joes have a problem at the very top of the chain of command the president (Jonathan Pryce back from the first movie) is behaving oddly. Its as if some maleficent being has taken over his body. Who could have done such a thing?The Joes find themselves on the receiving end of a devastating attack by their own government and only a few are left to fight back. (The casualties are among the films surprises.) The heavily muscled Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) takes the lead one of several characters from the G.I. Joe mythology not among the core players in the first movie. Others include Firefly (Ray Stevenson) who is a bit disappointing; Flint (DJ Cotrona) who is boring; Jinx (Elodie Yung) who isnt given enough to do; and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) who is just about right. Oh and the original G.I. Joe Joe Colton turns up in the person of Bruce Willis who really needs to stop doing this kind of dumb bit part.The G.I. Joes get help from an unexpected source along the way. And the films director Jon M. Chu executes a pretty good high-altitude fight scene. Still there should be a ""Fans Only"" sign at the door of every theater.""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) because the G.I. Joes are fighters. G.I.

A stunt rider (Ryan Gosling) starts robbing banks to provide for his lover (Eva Mendes) which puts him on a collision course with a detective (Bradley Cooper). (Photo/Video Focus Features) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com March 28 2013 627 p.m. ET One-third wonderful ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" weakens as it unfolds for lack of what makes the early part so good. The film structured as three sequential episodes with a common theme was directed by Derek Cianfrance and stars Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper and Eva Mendes. Mr. Gosling was superb as the explosive lover in the directors previous film ""Blue Valentine"" and hes superb once again as Luke a stunt motorcyclist with a traveling carnival who discovers that he has a baby son. This hero with a divided soul--a Gosling specialty--is such a powerful presence that his influence is felt even when hes off screen. Thats the intended consequence of the story which concerns the fates bequeathed by fathers to their sons. Still Luke is off screen much more than hes on a situation whose unintended consequence is an energy sink in an overlong drama that grows ever more mundane. Everything turns on Luke as the film begins; watching him is like watching a gathering storm. Some of the attraction flows from the actors appearance--bleached blond hair bemuscled body covered with tattoos. Mainly though we watch intently because a startlingly spare performance has been coupled with smart pared-back writing. (The script was written by Mr. Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder.) Luke speaks softly guardedly when Romina a former lover played affectingly by Ms. Mendes appears out of nowhere during the carnivals tour of upstate New York. ""Do you remember my name?"" she asks scanning his face for any sign of emotion. Far from having forgotten her hes drawn to her then stunned to learn she has given birth to his child. Stunned briefly but decisively. In a flash Luke commits to fatherhood just as he decides in a subsequent flash to provide for his son--shades of ""My boy Bill"" the carnival barkers soliloquy in ""Carousel""--by robbing banks with a newfound buddy named Robin ( Ben Mendelsohn shrewdly memorable in a minor role). These are existential decisions made by a prisoner of the moment whose longtime M.O. has been feeling things through instead of thinking about them. Theyre decisions that need no explanation and theyre all the more exciting to watch because they arent explained. For better and worse this flawed but touching hero is a man of action revealing himself through what he does rather what he says. If only such thematic and dramatic economy governed the films latter part which tracks the impact of Lukes deeds on the lives of many others including his son. In the middle panel of the movies triptych Mr. Cooper plays Avery Cross another kind of hero--at least hes hailed as such for while--who loses his way and all sense of his true self after a brief morally ambiguous intersection with Luke. Theres a sense that the filmmakers heart is in this part of the story which uses Averys rise from rookie cop to district attorney to examine the nature of heroism the temptations of power and the determinist fate that sets two sons--Lukes and Averys--on a collision course. This would seem to be serious stuff and Mr. Cooper makes his scheming character as interesting as the writing allows. (The young actor cast as Averys teenage son plays him as a witless though almost surely unwitting parody of the young Marlon Brando; its a disastrous performance.) For the most part though this is self-serious stuff seething with ambition but almost devoid of spontaneity and ultimately drained of genuine energy. By the time the generational circle closes emotion has given way to exhaustion. ENLARGE Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson Sundance Selects Gimme the Loot Sometimes principles can be a problem. I try to know as little as possible about movies before I see them so I can actually see them unclouded by bias or buzz. All I knew about ""Gimme the Loot"" was the running time 81 minutes and for the first 20 minutes I didnt think I could stick it out. What passes for a plot is more of a notion two young taggers from the Bronx Sofia and Malcolm drift cluelessly through the citys summer heat as they try to raise 500 in hopes of pulling off the ultimate triumph of New York tagging--covering the Mets home-run apple with graffiti. Little by little though the cluelessness grew endearing the cross-purpose conversations intricately funny the gritty look appealing. Watch a clip from the film ""Gimme the Loot."" When their latest work is buffed by a rival crew two graffiti writers embark on an elaborate plan to bomb the ultimate location the New York Mets Home Run Apple. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) Adam Leons debut feature as it turns out had already won prizes and praise at several festivals. Should I have known that in advance? Maybe so but I didnt and Im glad given the pleasure of discovery. Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson are terrific in the main roles. So is Zoe Lescaze as Ginnie a spoiled white kid who teaches the taggers a thing or two about drift and being dissolute. What Sofia and Malcolm dont know is amazing--they cant keep track of what floor theyre on in the course of a robbery he seems unaware that the flowers he casually stole for his mothers birthday need to be in water. Yet you find yourself rooting for them all the same--not for their success as taggers or petty thieves but for their flowering in a foreseeable future. ENLARGE Michel Bouquet Samuel Goldwyn Films Renoir If ""Renoir"" werent gorgeous to behold all would be lost from the start. Happily however this modestly scaled feature by Gilles Bourdos was shot by Mark Ping Bing Lee the Taiwan-born cinematographer who served as one of the shooters on the peerlessly beautiful ""In the Mood For Love."" Nothing is lost and much is gained from a luminous sense of place along with an intriguingly paradoxical though underdramatized portrait of the Impressionist master as a maker of beloved art who had little or no love to give those who loved him for himself. Heres Pierre-Auguste Renoir in 1915 near the end of his life--hes played by the splendid Michel Bouquet--still turning out paintings of undiminished beauty in the sublime Riviera setting of Cagnes-sur-Mer even though his hands are crippled by disease and hes often in pain. (The hand wielding the brush in closeups is that of a celebrated or notorious art forger Guy Ribes.) Heres Andree Heuschling an exquisite young woman newly come to model for Renoir; shes played extremely well given the limits of the writing and direction by Christa Theret. And here almost eerily is the old mans middle son Jean ( Vincent Rottiers). Back from the war with an injured leg young Jean Renoir is enchanted by Andree who will become his first wife and is guided by her faith in the talent that will make him one of the greatest film directors--one might argue the greatest director--of all time. ""Renoir"" is so beautiful and so intelligently conceived that you keep waiting in vain for a bit of fire to break out in the narrative. Its easy to be thankful though for vivid favors the details of Renoirs home which like the apartment in ""Amour"" speak volumes about those who live there; the sparkling light from a garden hose in an apple orchard; the bright light behind Andrees auburn hair; the warm light on her lovely breasts; the light radiating or so it seems from her crimson dress. Directors of photography used to be called lighting cameramen. This movie shows why. ENLARGE Jonathan Pryce Luke Bracey and Ray Stevenson Paramount Pictures G.I. Joe Retaliation Watch a clip from the film ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" The G.I. Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra; they are forced to contend with threats from within the government that jeopardize their very existence. (Photo/Video Paramount) Id like to think Im still a kid at heart but when I was a real kid I played with Lionel trains not Hasbro HAS 0.30 % action figures so I wont pretend that I had a great time watching ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" All the same it was good to find out that a few G.I. Joes could save the world from the vile U.S. president whod ordered all of them to be exterminated; that the vile president played by Jonathan Pryce wasnt who he seemed to be (i.e. a psychopathic monster playing Angry Birds on his cell phone while launching a nuclear strike); that thousands of nuclear missiles could self-destruct in flight without harm to the planet; that an even deadlier weapons system called Zeus could wipe out the whole city of London without harm to global morale and that hearing loss from countless explosions not to mention brain damage from dim dialogue could still be obviated by an inexpensive system of passive defense i.e. earplugs. ENLARGE Macarena Garcia Cohen Media Group Blancanieves For a different kind of paradox see ""Blancanieves"" Pablo Bergers spectacular retelling of the Snow White myth. Mr. Berger makes his heroine played by Macarena Garcia the daughter of a famous bullfighter who flees her evil stepmother falls in with a troupe of circus dwarfs and becomes a star toreador in her own right. Whats more the filmmaker puts her in 1920s Spain and tells her tale in a silent film shot in retroresplendent black-and-white. Its something of a stunt to be sure and destined to be seen at least by those who havent seen this remarkable film as emulating ""The Artist."" Yet the images in ""Blancanieves"" carry a dramatic charge that those in ""Renoir"" dont even though paradoxically theyre complemented only by music not by words. Watch a clip from the film ""Blancanieves"" a twist on the Snow White fairy tale that is set in 1920s Seville and centered on a female bullfighter. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) How this could be has to do with the essence of silent film. Mr. Berger and his cinematographer Kiko de la Rica work the wordless medium for all its worth whether with razzle-dazzle montages (Blancanieves stricken by amnesia suddenly sees her previous life playing out before her eyes during a crucial moment in the bull ring); swirling dances (flamenco doesnt need words) or searching closeups ( Maribel Verdus sex-crazed stepmother Encarna is evil incarnate but wittily so.) And Alfonso de Vilallongas music isnt mere accompaniment its a score with rich emotional resonance. The silents as this film suggests achieved aesthetic marvels before sound came along to set things back for a while. DVD Focus The Believer (2001) Ryan Gosling has spoken recently of giving up acting for a while. All the more reason to check out his first starring role on the big screen. Mr. Gosling is terrifyingly brilliant or brilliantly terrifying as the title character Danny Balint. Danny is Jewish a conceited bully of a yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man. Danny is also an anti-Semitic skinhead who wants nothing more than to kill Jews. Henry Beans remarkable film shows the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts. Vincent amp; Theo (1990) Ive recommended it before but ""Renoir"" calls it back to memory again. Robert Altmans film also portrays a peerless painter but in a very modern way its about art in the context of commerce. Tim Roth gives a phenomenal performance as Vincent van Gogh penniless and sinking into insanity as he does paintings that will one day sell for unimaginable millions. Paul Rhys is Vincents brother Theo a gallery owner who struggles to sell some of those paintings to a world that finds them of little interest and less value monetary or artistic. The Moment of Truth (1965) Francesco Rosis landmark film in Italian with English subtitles was shot documentary-style in brilliant color by Gianni Di Venanzo. Mr. Rosi isnt interested in the romantic trappings of the bull ring. He rips them away in order to show bullfighting as a bloody business that draws hopeful youngsters out of poverty only to exploit them by filling their heads with highfalutin notions of courage and art. The fictional hero Miguelin is played by the bullfighting legend Miguel Mateo known in real life as Miguelin. The film is available on a Criterion Blu-ray disc that does the original full justice.

Chu.Cast Dwayne Johnson Channing Tatum Jonathan Pryce.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of combat violence and martial arts action throughout and for brief sensuality and language. RELATED NEWS G.I. Joe sequel back on mission after 3-D delay By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Mar 28 2013 1106 AM Ever played a video game with a friend and had to sit there while he hogged it leaving you to do nothing but watch for what seemed like hours? On he goes blowing things up and randomly wreaking havoc. Although it can be interesting in bits and pieces youre never really invested in the outcome. The overall effect is one of boredom coupled with wasted time. Thats what watching ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is like. Director Jon M. Chu has the controls in hand and we sit idly by watching explosions and seemingly endless fight scenes. To keep things moving he doesnt waste our time with things like sensible plot direction or character development (this is a movie franchise based on toys after all). But man after a while what a slog. In the film the G.I. Joes are for those who didnt see the 2009 original an elite team of soldiers. (For those of us of a certain age they were also plastic action figures the same size as and ideal husband material for Barbie until Hasbro shrank them down. Ken? Ha.) Theyre led by Duke (Channing Tatum) who sports the scar on his cheek that G.I. Joe collectors will recognize. Tatums a good actor but here he seems to be channeling the plastic toy soldiers only if they were made of wood. His team includes Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) a wisecracking tough guy (imagine) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) Flint (D.J. Cotrona) Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung). At one point they visit Gen. Joe Colton ""the reason we call ourselves Joes"" Roadblock explains played with a notable lack of energy by Bruce Willis. (To be fair he is retired.) Without giving too much of the ""plot"" away its probably OK to say that the Joes as theyre called find themselves on the outs with the government as well as the president (Jonathan Pryce) who has been behaving strangely of late. Not himself you might say. The Cobra villains led by Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) are causing trouble again. The Joes must thwart a threat to the world instigated by Cobra because thats what heroes do in movies like this even though everyone thinks theyve gone rogue. How the citizenry reacts to this news is never shown. Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick do that a lot. Instead of working out what could be a thorny plot problem they just skip ahead to the next thing. And why not? Another fight awaits. One in particular is pretty spectacular involving ninja sword battles in the Himalayas with the participants swinging around on cords as they duke it out. Its dizzying fun but alas you cant fly that high forever. Soon enough the action is brought down to earth. Johnson is good with a quip and a gun which is whats called for here. Everyone else is pretty interchangeable with the exception of Pryce who is the best thing about the movie. More than anyone else even Johnson he seems to be having fun with his role; a line about taxes is laugh-out loud funny. You know funny on purpose. Not every funny thing about the movie is. Dumb fun can be well fun. ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is way too much of the former and not nearly enough of the latter. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Joe RetaliationStarring Dwayne Johnson Bruce Willis Adrianne Palicki Jonathan Pryce and Channing Tatum Behind the scenes Directed by Jon M. Chu Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of combat violence and martial-arts action throughout and for brief sensuality and language Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The Quick Hit The makers of this video-game-style movie try to make you feel as if youre racking up points just by following along. Its not exhilarating just exhausting. Grade C- For the latest bout of CGI debauchery theres ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" a film that tries to combine the quickness of quadruple analog sticks with the gaudiness and weight of vintage video-arcade displays. Unless youre already amped up from hours at an Xbox its exhausting not exhilarating. Non-initiates take heed ""G.I. Joe"" does not refer to a single hero and certainly not to the nickname for a common American soldier as in William Wellmans World War II classic ""The Story of G.I. Joe."" In todays pop culture ""G.I. Joe"" refers to an elite squad of warriors based on Hasbro action figures. Everyone calls the members ""Joes."" In the first G.I. Joe movie ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" the Joes mysterious group nemesis Cobra rose with the help of ""nanomites"" - mini-robots that look like evil fireflies and devour everything in their path. At the end of that movie the evil face-changing Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) assumed the identity of Americas president. He and the nanomites too make a lot more trouble in ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" Theyre key parts of Cobras paradoxical drive for global destruction and global domination. The main action begins when Cobra nearly eradicates the Joes while the elusive ninja Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) springs Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from prison. Three surviving Joes led by Dwayne Johnsons Roadblock must prove to the man described as the original Joe - Bruce Willis stoic almost granitic Gen. Joe Colton - that Cobra has installed a fake POTUS and plans on using him to hold the whole Earth hostage. The action flicks like a haywire pinwheel from Roadblocks team gathering evidence to Storm Shadow battling with Elodie Yungs comely Jinx and Ray Parks strong very silent Snake Eyes (they belong to the same extended martial-arts clan). The scriptwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and the director Jon M. Chu provide comic relief conscious and inadvertent (like RZAs uproariously awful appearance as ""Blind Master""). The intentional humor includes topical jokes so broad theyd make Jay Leno wince like the faux-president quipping that a nuclear holocaust will at least relieve him of having to go to a climate-change conference. (Jonathan Pryce again plays both presidents and is livelier as the vile right-wing fraud than as the vaguely liberal original. Why do fascists get to have all the fun in these movies?) Stale generation-gap gags get tossed between Adrianne Palickis spiky curvy Joe Lady Jaye and Willis Gen. Colton. She ""Are you all right? He ""My cholesterols a little high."" (""Red"" was far better at this kind of banter.) The moviemakers know theyre doing a video-game movie (they prove it early on with a video-game blackout joke). They try to make you feel as if youre racking up points simply by following along; they dare you to keep up with the action. But unless youre invested in the G.I. Joe empire (toys comics cartoons) theres no reason to take the dare. Every now and then a splashy piece of pop spectacle makes you lean back in appreciation - especially during a pitched ninja battle on the cliff-side of a mountain monastery sure to become a zip-line ride at a theme park near you. You ""lean back"" instead of ""sit on the edge of your seat"" because this films emphasis on speed and novelty is no way to generate traditional action-movie pleasures like elation or suspense. Whenever the Joes mount an attack you dont feel any mounting tension which is remarkable considering that the script freely kills off most of them and also cheerfully disposes of one beloved world capital. Director Chu doesnt pause for preparation and as a result we dont know when an assault team is hitting its marks. When Chu was a kid playing with his G.I. Joe toys filmmakers understood that to achieve maximum impact they had to educate the audience about what was at stake every step of the way. In ""GI Joe Retaliation"" only the martial-arts scenes have any real power. Without the proper buildup every other set piece is just a pyrotechnic jamboree. Movies like ""GI Joe Retaliation"" want to give you the video-game equivalent of an itchy trigger-finger. Its an emotion-free zone. The only human sound I heard at the screening came when the woman behind me went ""ooooh"" as Byung-hun Lee took off his shirt.

"Movie review G.I. Joe Retaliation - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate G.I. Joe Retaliation Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 03.28.13 | 257 PM ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is a movie based on kids toys and on the cartoons and comic books churned out to sell them. It stars Dwayne Johnson as a fightin man named Roadblock and has Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis playing soldier too (not for nearly as much screen time as the ads would suggest but still). Its the sequel to 2009s ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" remembered (vaguely?) for a splashy effects shot of the Eiffel Tower toppling. Not the sort of pedigree that makes us expect ""Zero Dark Thirty-One"" but at least we can count on some 3-D fireworks to help us choke down the nonsensical geopolitics. Or not. Director Jon M. Chu (""Step Up 3D"" ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"") whose prior credits somehow screamed ""action choreography"" to producers manages to make dull work of all the pop combat. One of the few things giving the movie a spark ironically is the fun being had by a slumming Jonathan Pryce as the presidents nanotechnologically disguised evil-doppelganger replacement. Hes a poor mans Merkin Muffley gone bad and hes even got James Carville fooled. Sample loopiness ""They call it a waterboard -- but I never get bored"" Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Find showtimes and theaters in 3D Find Showtimes and theaters in IMAX Pryces villain doesnt wait long to reveal his charade to the audience but those who caught the first installment know going in that hes secretly the nefarious Zartan. But to his ""fellow Americans"" the faux-prez declares that the militarys elite go-to unit the G.I. Joes have gone rogue. That leaves Roadblock Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) scrambling to clear their names (""G.I. Joe Ghost Protocol""?) and stop Zartan and masked master terrorist Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from taking over the world. (Their plan involves among other things using a killer satellite to destroy London much like Cobra wrecked Paris last time. Apparently the filmmakers have their own over-the-top plan to redefine ""Eurotrash."") Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Other franchise regulars feature in narratively random cutaway mayhem like so many action figures yanked from the toy box and scattered around the playroom. The Joes silent mystery man Snake Eyes (Ray Park ""Star Wars"") tangles with ninja antagonist Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) in a mountaintop retreat and apparently its all supposed to feel pretty momentous. What it really feels like is a pair of costumes posing as characters engaged in a drawn-out fight thats as tediously generic as they are. At least an ensuing high-altitude zipline chase is fresh enough to nudge us back from the ledge. Good luck recalling any other would-be set pieces a couple of days after youve seen ""Retaliation."" Do you remember though the old promotional tag dubbing vintage molded-pecs G.I. Joe ""a real American hero""? How funny that Pryce a tweedy Brit playing a bad guy should be the one person doing anything remotely heroic for this dud. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Joe Retaliation Is Missing That Wonderful G.I. Joe Silliness By Bilge Ebiri Follow BilgeEbiri We could easily just be watching outtakes from <i>The Expendables</i> or <i>The A-Team</i> or <i>The Losers</i>. 10 Shares Share 4 Tweet 6 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Photo credit Jaimie Trueblood/? 2013 Paramount Pictures. All Rights Reserved. Hasbro and its logo G.I. JOE and all related characters are Trademarks of Hasbro and used with permission. All Rights Reserved. An admission Im one of that small proud handful of jerks who actually liked the first G.I. Joe movie which despite being widely loathed was just enough of a hit that now theyve made another one. At the time The Rise of Cobra seemed like the kind of elaborate ridiculous and shallow entertainment that a child playing with his action figures might have dreamt up and for a couple of hours I was that child. In fact if youd told me the first film was the result of some time warp in which my 11-year-old self accidentally gained access to a CGI workstation I might have even believed it. No Transformers-ian bloat or Pirates of the Caribbean-esque tedium; just pure goofy stoopid fun. Thereas been a bit of rethinking and re-tinkering and rebooting with the sequel G.I. Joe Retaliation a sometimes for the better but often for the worse. The plot itself makes the reboot explicit. While disarming a Pakistani nuclear facility the G.I. Joes fall into a trap and are wiped out. (Among the fallen is the previous filmas hero Duke played by Channing Tatum.) Only three survive Roadblock (Dwayne aThe Rocka Johnson) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) along with silent masked Ninja ace Snake Eyes (Ray Park) whoas taken a leave of absence or something but soon enough re-joins the team. Apparently the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) has been replaced with an impostor Cobraas master of disguise Zartan (Arnold Vosloo seen rarely even though his character has tons of screen time). He and the rest of Cobra have an evil plan to force the entire world to disarm their nuclear weapons so that the nefarious organizationas latest superweapon can reign supreme. Oddly Pryce and the Impostor President concept are holdovers from the previous filmas ending but if you try to figure out how the timing between the two movies works given what appears to have happened in the meantime your brain might turn into that stuff Gwyneth Paltrow eats. The action this time around is a mixed bag. Director Stephen Sommerss cartoonish action scenes had a kind of devil-may-care bravado in the first film. Sommers (who also did the Mummy movies) has been replaced here by Jon M. Chu heretofore known primarily as the guy who gave a couple of the Step Up movies (the second and third specifically) their own brand of surreal vigor. Oddly enough that hasnt led to something more distinctive or compelling. The new film has less of that toys-being-knocked-around quality. This time the action has more heft more -- dare I say it? -- realism. But is that what a G.I. Joe movie needs? Gone is that sense of cartoonish fun replaced by a curious competent anonymity. We could easily just be watching outtakes from The Expendables or The A-Team or The Losers. Thats not entirely true. We still have Snake Eyes and his ongoing psychodrama with white-clad Ninja villain Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) which results in the films best scene an eye-popping and electrifying action set piece at the mysterious Ninja Mountain a remote retreat in the Himalayas. Watching a small army of Ninjas rappelling and zip-lining and bungee jumping as they fight across a mountain range you may find yourself remembering why such movies exist in the first place. (You may also find yourself anticipating the inevitable Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow spinoff that will surely come down the pike after this new movie makes a gazillion dollars.) But that amazing sequence in turn serves to remind you how corporate the rest of the movie often feels. That G.I.

(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood) By Stephanie Merry March 28 2013 Follow stephmerry Franchise reboots are multiplying at an alarming rate. No longer do filmmakers wait a decade or two for the memory of the last failure to fade. Instead like a quick fix for a frozen computer they push a few buttons and voila fresh start. Take for example 2009s ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" which transformed toy soldiers into Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid. It was annihilated by critics but performed well at the box office which means ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is being billed as a reboot. Except its not. Theres a new director Jon Chu -- the man behind a couple ""Step Up"" installments and the Justin Bieber documentary -- and ""Zombieland"" writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick signed on. But rather than wiping the slate clean the filmmakers integrate seemingly at random elements from the last film. The derided skin-tight black leather armor may have disappeared but Tatum returns as does a plot point involving a villain masquerading as the U.S. president. The writers resuscitated one deceased character but left others incapacitated. They stay just faithful enough to the last film to make this preposterous CGI-centric 3D extravaganza feel like a confused patchwork of new and old. Its as if the computer successfully restarted but half the icons disappeared. As the movie opens Tatums character Duke leads his team to Pakistan on what turns out to be a suicide mission ordered by the fake president. But this villain underestimates the Joes and a few survive including the new de facto commander Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). Now the target of the U.S. government the group has to go off the grid. All the nefarious threads lead to their archenemy Cobra Commander who seeks total world domination. The heroes scheming includes tracking down the original G.I. Joe now a curmudgeonly general played by Bruce Willis. Meanwhile a needless subplot carried over from the past film follows one of the Joes the mute ninja Snake Eyes. He now lives in the Himalayas answering to the cartoonish Blind Master played by an over-the-top RZA. Total world domination? A Wu-Tang Clan rapper as a blind ninja expert? Willis as the cocky grizzled risk-taker -- again? Although this all sounds utterly hilarious the films comedic intentions remain cloudy. For all its absurdity the movie takes itself awfully seriously. Yes the goofy one-liners are there but so are the earnest back stories about making it against all odds. And although ""G.I. Joe"" is merely a movie based on Hasbro toys the action -- the real point of all this -- feels just as lifeless. With so many sequences obviously computer generated the excitement bleeds right out of the fight scenes. Almost nothing is plausible. The fact that a spray of machine gun fire obliterates throwing stars without so much as touching the man hurling them is of minimal ridiculousness compared to the zip-lining chase scenes across mountainous cliffs. The brightest points of the movie come and go in the first 30 minutes with the bickering banter between Johnson and Tatum. For a couple of muscle-bound ruffians they certainly have impressive screen presence which explains why Johnson has the dubious honor of jump-starting so many franchises. (Look for him in ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" this year -- or dont.) If ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" teaches us one very small thing its that box office returns have more to do with familiar franchise names than film quality. People may flock to ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" despite its inert illogic. But dont say you werent warned. As a wise man once said ""knowing is half the battle."" G.I. Joe Retaliation (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for combat violence martial arts action brief sensuality and language. goingoutguide Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

"G.I. Joe Retaliation needs its own rescue mission - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Rescue mission needed for G.I. Joe RetaliationBut theres probably no saving director Jon M. Chus disjointed film which features Channing Tatum Dwayne Johnson and lots of explosions.March 27 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Who oh who will save the Joes while theyre out saving the world?No one apparently. To borrow from Jack in the Box ""G. I. Joe Retaliation"" is one hot mess.Waiting didnt help. The decision to push the film from last summer into this year was theoretically to allow the filmmakers to convert it to 3-D and quietly beef up the role for the suddenly hot Channing Tatum.Its easy to understand the thinking. In addition to last years winning streak in ""Magic Mike"" ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Vow"" the actor has five films out this year. Hes also a perfect pick for Duke the appealing all-American head of the elite G.I. Joe fighting corps. Tatum and Dwayne Johnson a back as Roadblock Dukes massive No. 2 a have the whole BFF thing nicely honed. But even with the rework Dukes presence is short-lived and not nearly enough to salvage the film.PHOTOS Scenes from G.I. Joe RetaliationConverting to 3-D during the delay didnt improve things either. Yes director Jon M. Chu succeeds in making it seem like the ninja sais are being hurled right at you. And sure some of the sheer rock-face rappelling and parkour running surpasses Chus ""Step Up 2 The Streets"" choreography. But all the new bells and whistles in the world and all the stylized stunts cant mask the movies problems.Do you really need 3-D when the basic pyrotechnics were already on steroids? The action sequences are so extensive that you can barely blink between explosions which should satisfy any fanboy cravings.The humor when it works offers ""Retaliation"" some redemption.There is some very good snark thanks to those wild and crazy ""Zombieland"" writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. But there is also a little too much leftover Spike TV stuff from their ""The Joe Schmo Show"" a by that I mean promising but half-baked.Unfortunately all the structural rigor and cleverness they brought to zombie-fighting gets lost in ""Retaliations"" overwhelmingly complicated globe-hopping enemies within enemies without story line.I will concede that adding a G.I. Jane to rough it up with the Joes was a nice touch. Adrianne Palickis Lady Jaye does a surprisingly good job of holding her own against all the testosterone. Ill even buy that this tough chip-on-her-shoulder chick who is ruffled when the original Joe (Bruce Willis) asks her to hand him a pen is totally fine slipping into a slinky little red number when a villain needs seducing. At least sneaking glances at Jaye changing gives Flint (D.J. Cotrona) some credible covert action to engage in. Otherwise the franchises new hunk is wasted.North Korea where the film opens becomes a running punch line that wouldnt survive were it not mostly in the good hands of Jonathan Pryce. Pryce you might recall from 2009s ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" is our countrys illustrious leader. ""Retaliation"" picks up and runs with the tantalizing hints that were dropped at the end Could the President be an impostor? Could he have an evil twin? Should they adjust his meds?PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot momentsPryce turns the Prez into the movies steadiest source of comic relief as the leader of the free world develops a sinister stand-up style. Warden Nigel James (Walton Goggins) comes in as a sarcastic close second in the humor category which any action blast worth its salt really must have.The wardens in charge of a super-secret prison in Germany where most of the surviving Cobras and the Joes central nemesis are being held in big tanks in a weird state of suspended animation. The better to see them I guess.The incarceration hasnt stopped their nefarious planning. Its also the opportunity to give sworn enemies Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) a chance to team up for a change and to add a female ninja named Jinx (Elodie Yung).While the Cobras hang the Joes are carrying out a super-dangerous mission in North Korea that goes south in devastating ways. The lesson to come out of that particular altercation gives the film its name a if you double-cross the Joes there will be payback.Willis Joe factors in relatively late in the game as the guy with all the big guns they need. He might have a souped-up tank or two in the garage out back. But its too little too late and too bad since hes one of the movies bright spots.Instead we are left with about a zillion individual plot lines to follow as the movie bounces from one global hot spot to another D.C. being the hottest of them all. There are countless characters a old and new a to keep up with. Grudges a also old and new a pile up by the truckloads. Bullets rain down. High-tech gizmos abound. Freedom and the fate of the entire world of course hang in the balance.Its massive all the retaliation and the world saving stuff. And its convoluted. Frankly no one should have to think that hard to keep up with the Joes.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESG.I.

Joe Retaliation (Photo by PARAMOUNT) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 28 2013 at 642 AM comments Bruce Willis Channing Tatum. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. If ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" had any more testosterone it could grow hair. If it were any stupider itd be a rock. OK no one expects a movie with ""G.I. Joe"" in the title to be clever. But at least the first film in the series knew it was dumb. And it had a few smart people -- like Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- who played it for camp. But ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" thinks its a real movie with real characters. It thinks we care about these thick-necked caricatures. It thinks they evoke real feelings and drama. But mostly it doesnt think at all. Although to older fans the name conjures up a plastic toy made for backyard cherrybombs in fact the movies are based on the spin-off comic books and cartoons that began a couple of decades later. Those turned the toys with kung-fu grip into a ""special mission force"" -- referred to laughably as ""the Joes"" -- who were fighting an ethnically non-specific terrorist group called Cobra. And the movies have picked up on that strange genre mashup of war movies and James Bond and run with it. Or mostly stumbled. Because as much as the producers talk about things like the ""G.I. Joe vs. Cobra mythology"" or -- no joke -- its ""internal aesthetics"" this is still a movie that has characters with names like Lady Jaye Roadblock and Firefly. Its a comic-book movie without any comic-book style a juvenile genre piece thats -- all too typically -- intimidated by strong women but erotically transfixed by big gleaming guns. The plot such as it is has Cobra out to take over the world first by installing a villainous impersonator in the White House. Who else to stop them but our heroic Joes -- or at least the few whove survived a treacherous attack? They dont have any sort of real plan but thats OK. The movie doesnt have any sort of real plot. Just a few strung-together setpieces -- an ""extraction"" in North Korea a raid in Pakistan a German prison break -- that dont build to anything. There is one well-staged fight scene a high-altitude battle with ninjas speeding back and forth on ziplines; director Jon M. Chus real interest and specialty has always been dance films and clearly the choreography of this sequence (and a few martial-arts ones) play to his strengths. But the rest of the action is just unmotivated and unmitigated nonsense to anyone but diehard fans. Who are Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow again and why are they carrying on like drama queens? Why is RZA playing a blind dojo master and making a fool of himself? Why is Channing Tatum even here? Well hes here to provide a link to the original film -- and boost the star quotient. But dont be fooled -- he doesnt stick around (and Willis only shows up at the end.) Mostly this is Johnsons show and he does what he can. He threatens bad guys he threatens to burst out of his T-shirts he uncorks his famous grin (look left flash teeth repeat). And of course he saves the world -- while promising in the films final moments a sequel. Which is how you know there really isnt a heroic squad of Joes in the land stopping senseless attacks on innocent Americans. Because if there were theyd start here. Ratings note The film contains constant violence. G.I. Joe Retaliation (PG-13) Paramount (110 min.) Directed by Jon M. Chu. With Channing Tatum Bruce Willis Dwayne Johnson.

Share Tweet Beyond general soullessness and stupidity--and all the other things associated with the phrase ""in association with Hasbro""--the biggest problem with 2009s G.I. Joe The Rise Of Cobra is that its a lumbering beast bogged down by too many characters and an incomprehensible plot. Some of that is endemic to the franchise With the individual members of the G.I. Joe squad and Cobra Commanders rogue army each needing some service streamlining the script into a brisk summer entertainment was never going to be easy but its dense plastic-toy mythos and perfunctory love story made for an irony-free Team America World Police. Sequels just by their more-is-more nature stand to exacerbate the problem and G.I. Joe Retaliation feels even more larded down by characters and conflicts no one could possibly care much about. Director Jon Chu improves on the action choreography--based on this and Step Up 3D he exploits the extra dimension as well as anyone--but a better model of shit is still shit. Picking up at the cliffhanger where The Rise Of Cobra left off Retaliation has Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) Cobras master of disguise impersonating the U.S. president played by Jonathan Pryce. With Zartan stationed at the Oval Office the Joes are set up in a raid that takes out most of the crew with only Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) surviving. Enlisting a little help from retired general Joseph Colton (a barely conscious Bruce Willis) this skeleton crew travels from the Himalayas to the White House to stop...well... some nukes-related scheme that doesnt a lot of sense. Whatever the case heres the rare film to make an evil scheme out of global nuclear disarmament. Though Chus G.I. Joe lacks the lightness and spirit of adventure that partially redeemed the original he compensates with an elegant marshaling of digital effects particularly in a sequence where the Joes engage in a little kung- and wire-fu around a Himalayan monastery. At times G.I. Joe Retaliation has a sense of its own ridiculousness--Pryce seems to be having a good time anyway--but not enough to soften the mass death hardware fetishism and militaristic zeal that gets in the way of its escapist fun. Adaptations of childrens toy lines apparently need to be treated with the utmost seriousness.

Joe Retaliation.(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   1/2 out of fourStars Dwayne Johnson Channing Tatum Adrianne Palicki Bruce Willis Ray ParkRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 50 minutes; opens Thursday nationwideNot that the bar was raised that high four years ago but G.I. Joe Retaliation marks a vast improvement over its toy-inspired predecessor.And while its still primarily fodder for kids Retaliation (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday nationwide) is a more sure-footed shoot-em-up that finds some heart wit and perhaps enough momentum to spawn a formidable action franchise.Delayed nearly a year to tweak its thunderous 3-D effects Retaliation flourishes by having nowhere to go but up. Its ancestor G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra earned some of the harshest reviews of 2009. But when a movie does 150 million in the USA and 300 million worldwide a sequel is inevitable.INTERVIEW Johnson Chu help G.I. Joe retaliateChanning Tatum returns as Duke the hero of our last film and the new leader of the G.I. Joe team which opens Retaliation by flying into Pakistan to recover lost nuclear warheads. The mission goes well but the team is ambushed in the middle of the night leaving survivors to regroup track their enemy and find out who in the U.S. government betrayed our buff heroes.Oscar voters need not put Retaliation on their must-see list but within the first 10 minutes the sequel establishes itself as superior to Cobra thanks to the relationship between Duke and buddy Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson). With a little dialogue over a video game the two form a deeper relationship than anything that manifested in Cobra.Still the film has no choice but to rely on that forgettable original which had a cliffhanger (and sequel-friendly) finale when the president (Jonathan Pryce) is abducted and cloned.Credit director Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D Justin Bieber Never Say Never) with making a quick tonal shift from campy special-effects romp to a straight action flick with summer flair.The film brings several actors back from the original including Tatum Pryce and Star Wars Ray Park as Snake Eyes a swordsman who like all our heroes prefers body-hugging uniforms.But Retaliation belongs to Johnson who was born to play a G.I. Joe. Its been years since his college football and pro wrestling days but Johnson remains a Mack Truck with a mischievous grin and his ""hoorah"" sounds like it could come from a soldier.Of course theres no real soldiering here. The movie racks up hundreds of fatalities and nary a drop of blood. These soldiers come straight off the pages of Maxim not Guns and Ammo.And anyone looking for serious fare will be left wanting. Dialogue is stiff action is relentless and the franchise remains built for the people who play with G.I. Joe dolls namely fanboys and real boys.But fans of the comics cartoons and action figures will be relieved to discover that the film-based squadron uncovered valuable intel.A conversation with Retaliation director Chu and Lady Jaye PalickiSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A conversation with G.I.

"G.I. Joe Retaliation | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; g-i-joe-retaliation ) G.I. Joe Retaliation (United States 2013) March 27 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli I confess a degree of bafflement about why Hollywood apparently considers it necessary to employ the dumbest possible screenplays for movies like this. On one level the only significant differences between G.I. Joe Retaliation and Transformers are the big robots and Megan Foxsa| assets. Admittedly one expects a certain amount of stupidity to go along with lots of explosions and special effects. It goes with the territory and to a degree is not only acceptable but welcome. After all one doesnt always want to spend two hours attempting to decode a mystifyingly complex narrative while being bombarded with dizzying visuals. Unfortunately theres a tipping point and G.I. Joe Retaliation goes so far beyond it that the idiocy is impossible to set aside. This was written for nine-year olds and its tough to see how any adult could swallow the storyline. Back in the mid-70s I used to play with G.I. Joe ""action figures"" (the accepted male-oriented term for ""dolls"") in my backyard. I can say with some degree of confidence that the scenarios I constructed were better thought out than the ones depicted in G.I. Joe Retaliation. But theres a lot of action right? Yes - this is an eye candy special. Jon M. Chu has made a careful study of Michael Bay movies and as a result this looks suspiciously like one. One would be foolish to assume the similarities are a coincidence. But theres a problem with action. Unless it involves tension which often comes from putting well-liked characters in some sort of legitimate danger it falls flat. Everything in G.I. Joe Retaliation is perfunctory - technically proficient but soulless. Its not exciting. Its boring. Eye candy is initially sweet but it doesnt take long before the resultant decay sets in. The movie is very violent but its of the teen-friendly variety. Violence without blood is like porn without semen. Lacking a ""money shot"" its all just a tease. Thats the legacy of PG-13. How does the sequel connect to its predecessor G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra? Not very solidly. Disappointed by the box office performance of the 2009 film Paramount ordered a near-reboot. Gone are most of the actors/characters from the first film although the lead Channing Tatum made the cut. Enter The Rock and Bruce Willis go-to action guys. The Rock ends up doing his Rock-y thing flexing muscles shooting guns and thumping bad guys - sort of like Arnold in the 80s. Willis has less screen time than in The Expendables 2 looks bored and is evidently on hand because he was offered a too-good to refuse salary. Meanwhile Tatums sudden meteoric rise to stardom encouraged last-minute reshoots that pushed back the opening date from June 2012 to March 2013. Tatums new scenes are evident since they come across as filler unrelated to the main storyline and despite gaining about ten minutes of additional screen time his character is not well-treated by G.I. Joe Retaliation. The sequel is all about burying the past and (almost) pretending like the first one never happened. I wasnt a fan of G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra but it may have been a better movie than this one. At least it was more fun. The premise for G.I. Joe Retaliation is a cross between a bad 007 flick and a worse superhero movie. It involves a megalomaniac with world domination aspirations who uses the most convoluted scheme imaginable to achieve his aims. He is Zartan an underling of Cobra Commander who was briefly played by Arnold Vosloo in Rise of the Cobra. Here after using nanotechnology to impersonate the President of the United States he looks like Jonathan Pryce. Zartans first goal after taking over the country is to send out a kill team headed by Firefly (Ray Stevenson) to eliminate Duke (Tatum) Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) Flint (D.J. Cotrona) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and the rest of the Joes. Once thats accomplished he turns his attention to global disarmament. The surviving Joes return to the United States to seek out the ""original Joe"" General Joe Colton (Willis) and co-opt his aid. Meanwhile Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) successfully executes his mission of freeing Cobra Commander from his underground prison. G.I. Joe Retaliation illustrates how 3-D can be a bad thing even when its implementation is competent. The 3-D used here is very much of the ""in your face"" variety. Its frequently splashy and showy and I found it to be distracting. The problem may be that the storyline is so flimsy that I was inordinately focused on the visuals but I occasionally found myself losing track of what was happening because of the 3-D. This 3-D isnt ""bad"" in the sense that much 3-D is bad - many of the usual problems arent evident - but it does a disservice to the film as a means of telling a story (although not nearly as great a disservice as the screenplay). To be fair G.I. Joe Retaliation does enough things right to avoid falling into the ""unwatchable"" category. The action scenes although lacking in excitement are cleanly presented. Theres a fair amount of cutting but not so much that they become incoherent. The rock climbing ninja fight is inventive and deserves points for ingenuity (if not for an adherence to the laws of physics). The destruction of London while entirely superfluous is nicely handled - its refreshing to see a city other than New York or Washington D.C. being crushed. And theres genuine humor in the ""gun browsing"" sequence at General Coltons house. Director Chu comes to this project without a solid action film resume. His previous behind-the-camera efforts include a couple of the Step Up sequels and the Justin Bieber fan-wank. This may in part explain why the action scenes although effectively choreographed are lacking when it comes to suspense and tension. The movie as a whole is poorly balanced with a clunky uneven beginning (owing in part to the shoehorning in of new Tatum scenes) too much exposition (for a plot that sounds dumber the more its explained) and too much bland by-the-book action. Theres an audience out there for this kind of thing (potentially a very big one). People seem to like stupid movies although Im not sure why. Maybe it makes them feel intellectually superior. I think my 9-year old self would have thoroughly enjoyed G.I. Joe Retaliation. Need I say more? G.I. Joe Retaliation (United States 2013) Director Jon M.

Joe The Rise of Cobra (Jaimie Trueblood) B- G.I. Joe Retaliation Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Dwayne Johnson Adrianne Palicki Channing Tatum Bruce Willis; Director Jon M. Chu; Release Date Wide 03/29/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 100; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 16 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT As befits an elite commando squad loosely inspired by a 49-year-old series of Hasbro toy soldiers the G.I. Joes in G.I. Joe Retaliation are a team of government combat renegades so wholesome and upstanding that they make the A-Team look like unsavory back-alley punks. The squareness ends with their one-dimensional personalities though. When they go into attack-the-enemy mode the action is videogame vicious and fast with a raucously propulsive heavy metal soundtrack to set off every jaw-smashing punch lightning-timed sword thrust and hail of bullets. Retaliation is a 3-D sequel to 2009s G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra and in its trivial and dehumanized way its a triumph of hyper-violent razor-sharp style over formulaic substance. Weve been watching these teams of U.S. government-approved military-jock ""outsiders"" plunge into combat for decades now -- they go all the way back to The Dirty Dozen and include The Expendables and other scruffier rip-off versions. But Hollywood has now evolved to the point that it can deliver these kinds of thrills with maximum brute force and keep the impact so light that the result can still be regarded at least by a sizable segment of the audience as a ""harmless"" diversion for 14-year-olds. In G.I. Joe Retaliation a collective of otherworldly invaders called Cobra has infiltrated the White House kidnapping the president and replacing him with a look-alike double. Both are played by Jonathan Pryce who gives a deviously smirky and fun bad-guy performance as the fake president. He orders the Joes to be wiped out and the plan almost works. (Channing Tatums Duke is one of the casualties -- a fittingly timed kill-off since Tatum is now far too big a star to be stuck in movies like this one.) But three of the Joes survive the sexy no-nonsense Lady Jaye played by Adrianne Palicki with a look-how-in-control-I-am delivery that starts off cloying but grows on you; D.J. Cotrona as the cute but rather blah Flint; and Roadblock played by Dwayne Johnson with a shaved head tattooed biceps the size of canned hams and his usual Obama-on-steroids blunt-spoken affability. Retaliation was directed by Jon M. Chu who made two of the Step Up dance films and he brings a high choreographic snap to much of the movie especially during a martial-arts battle set on a mountainous vertical stone cliff where the combatants skitter over the surface at death-defying angles as they try to annihilate each other. I also liked the swarms of tiny electronic firefly bombs that erupt with a satisfying percussive exactitude into fireballs and the final nuclear game of chicken between leaders at a world summit. Its much more tense (not to mention funnier) than the nuclear showdown in Olympus Has Fallen and this time the North Koreans are villainized in a way thats more mocking than saber-rattling. I dont want to make G.I. Joe Retaliation sound good exactly -- its well-executed technocratic action fluff. But it did leave me buzzed rather than drained.

Joe Retaliation knows its big and dumb Film Review G I Joe Retaliation This film image released by Paramount Pictures shows Channing Tatum left and Dwayne Johnson in a scene from ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) (Photo by AP Photo) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on March 27 2013 at 409 PM updated March 27 2013 at 414 PM comments CHRISTY LEMIRE AP Movie Critic If a big dumb action movie knows its a big dumb action movie and revels in that fact is that preferable to a big dumb action movie making the mistake of thinking its significant relevant art? Thats the question to ponder -- if you can think straight and your ears arent ringing too badly -- during ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" This sequel of sorts to the 2009 blockbuster ""G.I. Joe The Rise of the Cobra"" seems to have some cheeky fun with itself from Bruce Willis cheerily revealing the arsenal hes hiding in his quiet suburban home to RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan essentially showing up and playing himself. A major city is obliterated with the touch of a button and several others are in peril as the world hinges on nuclear destruction in what amounts to a hammy game of chicken. Nothing matters really. This is a movie based on a Hasbro toy after all -- its all spectacle and bombast. But at least ""G.I. Joe"" is aware of its vapidity compared to say last weeks ""Olympus Has Fallen"" in which North Korean terrorists took over the White House in self-serious fashion but our secret-service-agent hero found time to make wedged-in smart-alecky quips on the way to saving the day. Thats not to say that this ""G.I. Joe"" is good aside from a couple of dazzling action set pieces but at least its efficient in its muscular mindlessness. The elite military team of Joes now led by Duke (Channing Tatum returning from the first film) is sent to Pakistan to recover some nuclear weapons. But they find themselves double-crossed by their own government led by an imposter president and lose many among their ranks in a massive ambush. The survivors -- Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson reliable as ever) Flint (D.J. Cotrona whos given no personality) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki in full makeup for covert ops) -- must find out whos running the country and get to the bottom of this villains dastardly plan. Turns out its master of disguise Zartan part of the enemy group Cobra whos posing as the president while the real commander in chief is locked up in a bomb shelter. (Jonathan Pryce plays both roles; hes far too qualified for even one of them.) The three Joes realize they need help to bring him down so they round up the far-flung Snake Eyes (Ray Park) the petite warrior Jinx (Elodie Yung whose character trains with the Blind Master RZA) and the reluctant Storm Shadow (Korean superstar Byung-hun Lee an athletic and elegant specimen). They also need some firepower so they track down Willis Original Joe Gen. Colton who provides his own personal gun show. (Youd never know theres a gun control debate in this country from watching this movie; its all very macho and rah-rah. The flip side is none of the casualties from all this sophisticated weaponry results in any blood. This is an astonishingly violent PG-13 movie.) ""Retaliation"" initially was scheduled to come out last summer but the studio pulled it and delayed its release to convert the movie to 3-D. With a director like Jon M. Chu whos shown a flair for integrating 3-D with the dance extravaganza ""Step Up 3D"" and the concert film ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" why not just shoot it that way in the first place? As it stands now the extra dimension doesnt add much and often is used in that simplistic tried-and-true way of flinging things at us from the screen bullets throwing stars etc. There is one absolutely astounding extended sequence about halfway through in which two teams of ninjas face off in a battle on the sheer cliff faces of the Himalayas. Using cables and zip lines its as if theyre running leaping and practically dancing on walls in the sky -- a breathtaking piece of choreography in its own right regardless of the dimension through which its viewed. ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of combat violence and martial arts action throughout and for brief sensuality. Running time 110 minutes.

Joe Retaliation Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday March 28 2013 600 AM facebook Tweet email Channing Tatum (l.) plays Duke and Dwayne Johnson is Roadblock in G.I. Joe Retaliation. Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday March 28 2013 600 AM Title G.I. Joe Retaliation Film Info PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. The G.I. Joe team is back and most of their sophomore movie adventure ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is as bland as their name and as subtle as an exploding tank. Not that a movie based on 50-year-old Hasbro action figures is expected to be anything else. Still just because it originated with plastic doesnt mean it has to feel like that. The 2009 ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" had some ingenuity and verve two crucial elements missing from ""Retaliation."" Whats left is a lot of running around and shoddily filmed action scenes. Channing Tatum winning this months Good Sport award reports briefly for duty as Duke the leader of ""the Joes."" His second-in-command is Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) and the team includes pretty boy Flint (D.J. Cotrona) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) -- whose name and wardrobe recall a Greenwich Village drag queen -- and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) the silent unknown martial artist swathed in a black stocking. An attack in Pakistan carried out by the evil organization Cobra and its commander handily named Cobra Commander decimates ""the Joes."" Roadblock Lady Jaye and Flint connect with the original ""Joe"" formally known as Gen. Joe Colton (Bruce Willis). Their theory is that the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce) is a Cobra impostor wholl nuke the planet so Colton and rogue ninja Storm Shadow help out. There are secondary characters running to-and-fro (a guy with electronic bugs named Firefly Storm Shadows cousin Jinx and the shape-shifting baddie Zartan) but they blur together. Viewers who grew up on the 1980s animated ""G.I. Joe"" series and its affiliated trinkets may know the players without a scorecard though its questionable if theyll dig the odd array of 80s references from ""the quicker-picker-upper"" to ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" to the Clapper. Bruce Willis with Adrianne Palicki in G.I. Joe Retaliation Others may find the badly shot action scenes that director Jon M. Chu (""Step Up 2 The Streets"") provides devoid of thrills. There is one centerpiece scene on a mountainside thats cool and inventive with teams of Joes and Cobra ninjas zipping along cords and bashing each other at high altitudes. Other lightning-fast highlights Johnsons arched eyebrows and Willis quips during a cameo. Initially Tatums character was killed off early in this movie but the actors star was rising and he agreed to a bit more time. After enduring the bombastic silly ""Retaliation"" its clear why one might not want to stick around too long. This is an average Joe flick at best.

"G.I. Joe Retaliation as dull as a Rock review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesG.I. Joe Retaliation as dull as a Rock reviewG.I. Joe Retaliation is an ADD condition masquerading as a movie hiding behind incoherent directing and editing to minimize mayhem so as to secure a lucrative PG-13 American rating.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. March 27 2013G.I. Joe RetaliationStarring Dwayne Johnson Bruce Willis Jonathan Pryce Channing Tatum Adrianne Palicki and Ray Park. Directed by Jon Chu. 111 minutes. Opens March 28 at major theatres. PGAnother week another kidnapped U.S. president terrorized White House and nuclear threat the outraged and outcast good guys have to stop.G.I. Joe Retaliation is all that and less. Whod have thought that just a week after the release of Olympus Has Fallen wed feel inclined to retroactively upgrade it in comparison to the newcomer for being a model of energy concision and honest intent?Article Continued BelowOlympus Has Fallen is no masterpiece but it has a strong narrative line -- America gets attacked kicks asses -- and an ""R"" rating stateside that appropriately reflects the huge amount of violence and blood on the screen.G.I. Joe Retaliation is a case of ADHD masquerading as a movie hiding behind incoherent directing writing and editing to minimize mayhem so as to secure a kid-friendly and lucrative PG-13 American rating (PG in Ontario). Its like a giant explosion on a distant planet observed but not felt.This multimedia franchise has bizarrely devolved over the decades. It began as a controversial 1960s action figure that required human involvement. It morphed into a formula 1980 cartoon series with catchphrase wisdom for kiddies ""Knowing is half the battle.""Now G.I. Joe is reduced to an incomprehensible blur of throbbing testosterone tin men (and women) who rattle their swords rat-tat-tat their machine guns and shout inanities at each other to no intelligent purpose. Even when something really big happens -- say a major world city being blown up -- the effect is like being hit with a clowns Nerf bat.The film is as dull as a Rock. The stolid Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson joins grumpy Bruce Willis as the new top squarejaws of the changing cast most of the original players having wisely opted for better gigs or early story exits.The only reason I give Retaliation a half-star higher rating than the even worse G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra from 2009 is that Jonathan Pryce gets to chew acres of shrubbery as both the Real President and the Evil President. Hes more fun here than when he played a Bond villain.Pryce is frequently hilarious as Evil Prez earning what few laughs the movie has by doing his best Dr. Evil impersonation -- such as a scene where he threatens world leaders with global devastation and then calmly starts playing Angry Birds on his iPhone. Evil Prez is running America while Real Prez is held captive in the White House basement. This part of the convoluted plot picks up from where the first movie ended after terrorist Cobra chameleon Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) shape-shifted into the Commander-in-Chief. Its the most dastardly deception since the Beatles replaced Paul McCartney with a double (you knew about that didnt you?).Evil Prez has everybody fooled except for sharpies such as the shapely new female ""Joe"" Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) who gets suspicious when she discovers that unlike Real Prez the imposter doesnt use such empty phrases as ""you know"" and ""kind of"" in his official speeches.Sounds like an improvement you know except Evil Prez also has an itchy trigger finger (""Im the quicker blower-upper baby"") and a yen for world domination. He and his hench-thingies mastermind a nuclear frame-up and ambush that leave the Joes decimated and disbanded. Surviving members Roadblock (Johnson) Lady Jaye and Flint (D. J. Cotrona) are on the run and attempting to unmask the presidential imposter and save the world without attracting undue attention.Thats tough to do when all guys like Roadblock want to do is shoot things with cannons or drive tanks down the street. But just like their cartoon equivalents they have techno gadgets to assist them. Theyve also got group founder and namesake General Joe Colton (Willis) who bizarrely keeps calling Jaye ""Brenda"" and who comes out of retirement to offer ferocity and firepower. The latter include grenades that he keeps in his fruit bowl.Meanwhile over in the Far East a whole other movie is happening a marginally better one involving fellow action figures Snake Eyes (Ray Park) Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) Jinx (Elodie Yung) and others too tedious to mention. The Easterners get up to a couple of halfway decent martial arts scenes and their adventures eventually interact with the main Joe job like a pair of explosive Venn diagrams. The plots and subplots are so tortuous its like Mission Impossible with grunting.G.I. Joe Retaliation was originally supposed to open in June 2012 but was held back until now reportedly for 3D supersizing that achieves precisely nothing. There were also reshoots and other salvage efforts.Its clear from frame one that the project was too much for director Jon M. Chu whose previous credits include two Step Up dance movie sequels and the pop doc Justin Bieber Never Say Never. We might have expected more from screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. They co-wrote the very funny Zombieland but here theyre just zombies.And what of rising star Channing Tatum whose leather-necked Duke character was given extra screen time as part of those reshoots? He wisely ducks out early but not before a scene where Duke plays a video war game with Roadblock and gets thoroughly disoriented and abused.After watching G.I. Joe Retaliation we can sympathize Duke we really can.Read more about Justin BieberThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Joe Retaliation""       Photo AP The first one was a G.I joke but the sequel ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" has enough hoo-ah to bring a satisfying blast of blockbustery summer to dreary March. Wisely ditching the director the writers and most of the cast of the freeway pileup that was the first film this one sticks to business ninjas machine guns and international super-commandos with stripper names. Jinx Jaye and Duke (Channing Tatums character not that he would ever take his clothes off for money) are all about sneaking into heavily fortified enemy camps and saving the world via deployment of precisely targeted catchphrases. ""Check check"" ""Hell yeah"" ""Drive it like you stole it"" At the start Dwayne Johnson (who somehow managed not to be in the first one) and Tatum are buddy soldiers who blow away bad guys in North Korea then invade Pakistan after the assassination of its president to secure the nations nukes on behalf of the US president (Jonathan Pryce) -- who as we found out at the end of the excruciating first film is actually evil Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) in disguise. So the president is an impostor who starts giving peacenik speeches about a nuclear-free world. Psychopathic megalomaniacs are bad enough but this guy is starting to sound like Jimmy Carter. Zartan and others from the malevolent Team Cobra keep the real president alive in an underground bunker though just to have someone to chat with about their malevolent scheme. Occasionally they deliver political commentary. One guy whomps the pres upside the head then says ""Thats for the tax hike"" Meanwhile with the assistance of the indestructible Firefly (Ray Stevenson) who hurls robo-lightning bugs that blow up like grenades the masked evil Cobra Commander busts out of his underground prison and returns to power in the company of his chief ninja Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) who is working both sides of the ledger. Storm winds up stunned zipped into a body bag and carried around like a lunchbox for perhaps the best of the many nifty action scenes good ninja Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his partner Jinx (Elodie Yung) swoop along the sides of a mountain on climbing ropes fending off the sword attacks of the Cobra teams junior henchmen. Back in the states the Joes top lady commando Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) decides theres something fishy about the way the president has been acting lately and resolves to get a swatch of his DNA. To get close enough to snag a hair off his jacket she puts on a flame-red dress and pretends to be a Fox News Channel reporter. ""I guess thats why youre so fair and balanced"" Pryce says eye-bonking her. The loose one-liner-heavy script (from the writers of the very funny ""Zombieland"") matches up well with the action which is ridiculous but not senseless. Its fun instead of gory and the look (which resembles a classic James Bond film) is an improvement over the aggressive ugliness of recent shoot-em-ups such as the last ""Die Hard"" and ""Expendables"" movies. Both of them like this one featured Bruce Willis but Willis is at his relaxed best this time. Hes the original G.I. Joe the general who gave the team its name but is now retired in suburbia. Those burbs give the movie much of its wit and a ""True Lies""-like grounding that makes it relatable Battle-forged Duke is terrified of nothing so much as baby-sitting his friends kids on karaoke night and at General Joes house you simply flip up the range top to discover a cache of automatic weapons. (Grenades the size of limes of course are hidden in the fruit bowl.) During downtime the guys do things like try to blow the birthday candle off a cupcake at 20 yards and in battle they vow to ""make it home in time for Top Chef. "" Without turning into a kids movie the film has a light touch that is a welcome replacement for the humorless roid-rager bloodlust of many an R-rated action flick. In the great big whomping climax London gets flattened (no great loss; the place is about as vital as St. Louis these days) a man walks away from a fireball (you gotta respect the classics) and General Joe brandishes the pearl-handled pistol that once belonged to Patton. In a firefight he is asked if he is all right. Not really ""My cholesterols a little high"" he says. Sergeant get this man some Lipitor double-time. John McClane is over but General Joe is just getting started.

Joe Retaliation review Action doesnt figure Updated March 27 2013 250 PM By RAFER GUZMAN rafer.guzmannewsday.com + - Channing Tatum left and Dwayne Johnson in a scene from ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Chapter Two in the Hasbro franchise with old foes and new Joes. Rated PG-13 (violence) BOTTOM LINE The junky pleasures of the first installment now just seem like junk in this noisy nonsensical lead-footed sequel. CAST Channing Tatum Dwayne Johnson Bruce Willis LENGTH 140 Back in 2009 Hasbro followed its ""Transformers"" hits with another toy-based hoo-ra extravaganza ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra."" It was a junky guilty pleasure starring a cusp-of-fame Channing Tatum as team leader Duke and the whole thing had the energy of a young recruit eager to please game for anything immune to embarrassment. ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" however is the opposite. This botched sequel feels like a shell-shock victim flailing screaming inept and utterly incoherent. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Thats a shame since the franchise promised some B-grade summer fun. Tatum who since 2009 has discovered his acting skills and comedic timing (or maybe we just learned to appreciate them in movies like ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Magic Mike"") is basically absent here and its a critical wound to the film. The now-rising star shows up just long enough to say goodbye to this early role then turns things over to Dwayne Johnson as the hulking soldier Roadblock. The always likable Johnson cant save this material though. 232 VideoGI Joe Retaliation The story is a disastrous mess in which the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) is still a hostage the nefarious Cobra group is plotting something nuclear and the conflicted warrior Storm Shadow played by the charismatic Byung-hun Lee is still brooding about his childhood. (Look for the rapper RZA as Blind Master.) advertisement | advertise on newsday Its impossible to keep track of the characters Say goodbye to Destro say hubba-hubba to new addition Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and say peek-a-boo to Bruce Willis popping in and out as the original General Joe Colton. Replacing director Stephen Sommers is Jon M. Chu known for teeny-bopper movies like ""Step Up 3D"" and ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" but his gifts for capturing choreography dont transfer. Aside from an impressive rappelling chase through the Himalayas the action scenes make almost zero sense; even most punches land far from chins. For all the deafening noise and rather startling destruction -- all of London disappears without much ceremony -- ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" moves at a painfully slow crawl barely dragging itself from one scene to the next. MoviesMust-see movies for 2013 Thats certainly a problem the first movie never had. Until further notice consider the ""G.I. Joe"" franchise out on medical leave. PLOT Chapter Two in the Hasbro franchise with old foes and new Joes.

Joe Retaliations a Battle of Dumb Pleasures Versus Your Higher Brain Function Thursday March 28 2013 at 4 a.m. By Alan Scherstuhl Bruce Willis needs G.I. Joe more than G.I. Joe needs him. What must Bruce Willis have felt when he discovered that his seven or so minutes of G.I. Joe Retaliation screen time offer much more agreeable Bruce Willis-ness than the entirety of A Good Day to Die Hard? Or that his cameo shot two years back and rich with quips and guns and old-soldier gravitas isnt even the best part of this long-delayed sequel to a toy commercial? Or that the basics that the last Die Hard botched--showing us where combatants are in relation to each other or letting us in on the reasons why combatants are combatants--here are no-sweat aced in scene after scene even in the crazy-pants one where a ninja vrooms his motorcycle over an improvised ramp and then jumps off as said motorcycle folds in on itself becomes four separate flying bombs and suicide-dives into the front doors of a government prison? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Seriously how must Bruce Willis have ached when he realized that less than a year after his strong work in Looper he needs G.I. Joe more than G.I. Joe needs him?Its not enough to call this the rare franchise action movie to bring the goods; its the even rarer one whose creators seem to understand what the goods even are. Your ticket should come with a fight card squad versus squad bruiser versus bruiser ninja versus ninja second-string ninja versus ancient ninja training lady jeep-tank versus tank-jeep bullets versus throwing stars everyone versus Walton Goggins dumb pleasures versus your higher brain function.Film Details G.I. Joe Retaliation RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time110 More Info Trailer Its a common complaint that Hollywood doesnt make good movies anymore just event pictures. Sadder still is that at this point even a competent event picture is itself an event. This one pushes right past competent into mostly legitimately enjoyable. Ninjas swing and zipline through Himalayan peaks giving dizzier Spider-Man thrills than The Amazing Spider-Man bothered to. A three-soldier escape from deep in a well is more satisfying--and abbreviated--than Bruce Waynes ponderous pit-climb last summer. Charming Dwayne Johnson declaims Jay-Z as scripture to pump up his Joes before a mission; hes so commanding that nothing pump-uppable in you is likely to languish un-pumped. Serious dialogue is hilarious--""Ill cyberblast an encoded beacon every six hours""--and comic dialogue is sometimes confounding ""They call it a waterboard but I never get bored."" In short if you think its possible you might have a good time at a picture named G.I. Joe Retaliation  you will almost certainly have a good time.The movie is still dumb as catbutt. Its an honest and accomplished dumbness however where the stupidest stuff seems to be there because the movie would be less fun without it. Silent masked ninja Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is hauled by government agents into a quadruple-secret deep-underground maximum-security supervillain prison but nobody bothers to take his mask off or remove his weapons first. Those ninjas rappelling down cliffs in this seasons best chase scene never realize that maybe they should just cut their enemies lines. And of course Bruce Williss retired badass--based on the original 60s G.I. Joe dolls--has an arsenal of weapons hidden in every drawer and closet of his home. The script from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is touched with absurdist comedy and even some of-the-moment wingnuttery. Heres a movie in which gun-toting lugs become convinced the president is an imposter who they have to take out--not really something we should be encouraging so soon after 2016 Obamas America. The villains grand plan involves tricking the globes nuclear powers into unilateral disarmament and then zapping the suckers with a weapon from the skies. ""Soon the world will cower in the face of Zeus"" the Cobra Commander shouts from beneath his Hasbro face-plate; once the world is finally cowering and billions of people seem doomed that imposter president (a funny Jonathan Pryce) exults that at least he wont have to go to another global warming summit. Even the usual tough girl-empowerment business is stamped by Fox Nation boyishness As the heroic Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) laments that her father didnt believe women should be soldiers her co-Joe Flint (D.J. Cotrona) takes a PG-13 peep at her in her thong. One caveat for the Red Dawn crowd In the interest of international grosses the flag-waving is minimized save ones bearing the logos of toy lines. If its any compensation RZA shows up as a blind sensei in a dojo that looks like a mini-golf course.There is a story here about the Joes being betrayed and mostly wiped out by our government. Its smooth and crowd-pleasing. Theres also a better funnier story about the studio making the mistake of killing Channing Tatum off 20 minutes in and then delaying the movie a year to give him a couple more scenes. But the story that actually matters is that of the director Jon M. Chu who comes to dudes-fighting filmmaking from the most welcome of backgrounds directing dance.

Joe Retaliation."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) ""Joe"" is an honorable name an homage to the average guy who raised the son of God as his own child. So good Lord what did we do to deserve ""G.I. Joe Retaliation""?This sequel to a 2009 action flick that flew under the radar to snatch about 300 million of worldwide revenues takes average-ness to new depths. With the courage of no convictions except selling popcorn and toys its like a lavishly funded puppet show. So when the entire city of London is leveled by a maniacs secret weapon were so distracted by the lack of visible strings that we dont notice the lack of civilian casualties.The maniac in question is the faceless Cobra Commander a latter-day Darth Vader who has a succinct agenda ""I want it all."" As part of his fiendish scheme to take over the world he sends a shape-shifting henchman to abduct and impersonate the president of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The fake president then sends the elite commandos called the G.I. Joes into a desert ambush that leaves most of them dead.Survivors nicknamed Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) go incognito to unmask the make-believe leader in Washington where they enlist the help of the gun-hoarding hero who gave the group its name Gen. Joe Colton (Bruce Willis in an extended cameo). They also must make peace with a masked ninja called Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) whose role in the loose-ended script is among many that are hard to decipher. To his credit director Jon M. Chu applies some of the choreography skills he honed in two of the ""Step Up"" movies to the fight sequences which are bloodless. And the 3-D is often effective especially during a zipline escape from a mountain fortress.As long as Hollywood keeps hitting us over the head with empty spectacles like ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" regular Joes will be too numb to fight back.What ""G.I.

Joe Retaliation Review Saturday Morning Cartoon Writ Large By    Alonso Duralde on March 27 2013  1036 am Follow aduralde Email Print The PG-13 action sequences pile on relentlessly lest the audience get a chance to breathe...or think Studio marketers love to call action movies ""thrill rides"" but heres the thing about thrill rides -- they work because they occasionally stop to let you catch your breath before jolting you again. Roller coasters dont just speed downhill for the entire ride; there are climbs and flat parts so that you can scream again all the louder when you take another plunge. Thats not what happens in ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" a movie not only designed for hyperactive 10-year-old boys but also apparently written and directed by them even though the credits claim that Jon M. Chu (""Step Up 3D"" ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"") was behind the camera and Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (who gave us the far superior ""Zombieland"") crafted the inane dialogue and bang-clang-boom plot. ""Retaliation"" begins with the GI Joe team flying into Pakistan to recover some loose nukes after the assassination of the nations leader has led to chaos in the streets. (""Its not a country its a riot with a zip code"" yelps a member of the joint chiefs.) The mission led by Duke (Channing Tatum) goes well but that night the Joes encampment is destroyed by enemy fire leaving few survivors. Turns out that the president (Jonathan Pryce) has been replaced by master of disguise Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) and while the real POTUS is held captive in a bomb shelter the fake one is conspiring with the villainous COBRA to take over the world. After apparently destroying and discrediting the Joes the next move is to spring Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) from an underground prison by sending in Storm Shadow (Byung-Hun Lee) dressed as Snake Eyes (Ray Park). Wow this sounds even stupider on paper than it did in my head. Anyway surviving Joes Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) work to expose the fake president with the help of retired O.G. Joe General Colton (Bruce Willis) while on the other side of the world Snake Eyes and Jinx (Elodie Yung) try to capture Storm Shadow all in the name of selling toys. Or rather saving the planet. Whichever. Anyone looking to discuss the MPAAs ridiculous standards when it comes to screen violence can start right here; ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" has even more explosions gunshots hand-to-hand combat and people getting tossed off roofs than ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (another movie where the U.S. flag gets taken down from the White House) but since ""Olympus"" shows blood and people actually dying it gets an R while ""Joe"" squeaks by with a PG-13. The violence becomes all the more apparent because Chu never paces it. Early on we get a few scenes in which people stop to have conversations -- granted theyre not all that interesting but at least they break up the flow. Once the story picks up however its all ka-blam all the time but rather than generate thrills and excitement it ultimately becomes enervating. For a guy whos made two movies based in music and dance he has a surprising lack of rhythm here. The cast pretty much plays it straight rather than go over the top -- apart from Walton Goggins amusing scenery-chewing as the warden of the super-prison -- but theyre all apparently on board for a movie with as much depth as a Saturday morning cartoon. Not that theres anything wrong with Saturday morning cartoons mind you but theres a reason they dont last two hours. Breaking News To Your Inbox. Sign up >> http//twitter.com/share?text=G.I.

"G.I. Joe Retaliation review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies G.I. Joes mission Frantic action  G.I. Joe Retaliation Channing Tatum and Dwayne Johnson star in ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" Channing Tatum and Dwayne Johnson star in ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Right in the middle of ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" which is one sort of action movie theres another better one that lasts five or six very good minutes.Were in the Himalayas where the fancy ninjas such as Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) go for a little me-time and to brush up on their training. With a sword to my head I couldnt tell you who was fighting whom but on the face of a mountainside with dozens of ninjas hooked up to mountain-climbing ropes the slash-and-plunge combat served up by director Jon M. Chu (who made the tasty second and third ""Step Up"" films) makes for a lucid and exciting sequence. It may be hoked-up digitally beyond anything resembling human behavior -- its ""Spider-Man"" behavior with the climbing ropes used for mile-long swings -- but it works. Then were dragged back to the other movie the one in keeping with the concerns the body count and the general ""eh"" quality level of the first ""G.I. Joe"" film released four years ago.The stars of ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" which is not to be confused with ""G.I. Joe Appeasement"" or ""G.I. Joe Lets Talk Through Our Differences"" are Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock; Channing Tatum as Duke; D.J. Cotrona as Flint; and Adrianne Palicki as Lady Jaye. The plot concerns the murder of the Pakistani president; stolen nukes; a frame-up job by arch-fiends COBRA (not the insurance people for the record) disgracing the Joes. The Joes fight back. Spoiler They win. Now and then the screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick whose ""Zombieland"" I liked fire off a peculiar zinger that catches your ear especially when Jonathan Pryce (in the dual role of the real U.S. president and the evil lookalike now running things) escalates global warfare with a demented sort of elan. Many are killed. The Joes truly enjoy their killing. They kill with style and a smile. Bruce Willis plays the ur-Joe Joe Colton who joins the Joes in the retaliation promised by the title and whose kitchen drawers and cupboards are filled with lovingly ogled weaponry.The directive behind this sequel clearly was non-stop action. Lets think about that phrase a second. Do we really want our action movies to deliver action that does not stop? Ever? I get a little tired of action sequences that wont stop. ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" has some trouble with tone One minute its wisecracks between Johnson and Tatum as theyre sitting on the couch with their little Xbox joysticks and the next London is flattened (millions dead presumably though we never hear about it) by the antagonists weapons of mass destruction. The screening I attended was full of preteens to whom ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" has been marketed.I submit that playing with G.I. Joe action figures when youre that age as I did and apparently everyone in the cast of this movie did according to the films press materials is not the same experience as a preteen soaking up this amount of PG-13-rated slaughter.

Joe Retaliation Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 27 2013 | 1000AM PT Offering a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" might well have been titled ""G.I. Joe Regurgitation"" advertising big guns visual effects and that other line of Hasbro toys with the same joyless chew-everything-up-and-spit-it-out efficiency. Largely devoid of personality apart from a few nifty action flourishes courtesy of helmer Jon M. Chu Paramounts late-March blockbuster pushed back from a 2012 release (ostensibly to allow for a 3D conversion) may have trouble matching ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobras"" 302 million worldwide gross. But with no shortage of merchandising and other cross-promotional opportunities it should still score significant attention from targeted male viewers. Appreciably rougher and grittier in feel than the Stephen Sommers-directed ""The Rise of Cobra"" ""Retaliation"" makes any number of ham-fisted bids for topical relevance and naturally almost every one of them represents an affront to good taste. Among other things the film is a sort of accidental comedy about nuclear warfare as much of the silly plot concerns a global summit where the hope of mass disarmament soon gives way to the threat of mass annihilation. Elsewhere the script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) finds our trusty Joes raiding a North Korean compound shortly before they head to Islamabad where they wind up framed for the assassination of Pakistans president. All this geopolitical mayhem is being orchestrated by the U.S. commander-in-chief (Jonathan Pryce) -- or rather the dastardly doppelganger whos impersonating him with the aid of super-sophisticated ""nanomite"" technology (because latex is just a little too ""Mission Impossible""). The presidents stand-in is a high-ranking member of Cobra a secret network of megalomaniacs bent on wiping out the G.I. Joes once and for all and in the early going they come perilously close. Probably aware that no one in the audience could possibly care about any sense of continuity with ""The Rise of Cobra"" and its eminently forgettable characters the filmmakers have opted to retain just a few key players this time around. In what feels like an odd miscalculation given the actors recent popularity Channing Tatums Duke is around for only about 10 minutes to pass the baton to a fresh G.I. Joe unit led by the physically imposing Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) and rounded out by Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) both of whom evince far less charisma than the military-grade weapons provided them by Gen. Joe Colton (Bruce Willis phoning it in). Providing a bit more interest is the Joes ninja faction chiefly Snake Eyes (Ray Park) whose inexpressive mask stands in marked contrast to the piercing gaze of his longtime nemesis white-clad swordfighter Storm Shadow (Korean star Byung-hun Lee). Along with newcomer Jinx (Elodie Yung) these returning characters figure prominently into the pictures finest moment a fight scene in the Himalayas that employs wirework and stereoscopy to highly vertiginous effect. The visual grace of this sequence is no surprise coming from Chu who demonstrated a real flair for staging in the two ""Step Up"" pics he directed. But as in those movies sustaining a narrative or transcending a patchy script seem beyond his abilities. One of the least savory aspects of the franchise is the unseemly pleasure it takes in the wholesale destruction of foreign cities which goes hand-in-hand with its jingoistic portrait of American military might. Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in ""Cobra"" will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here although the sequence is tossed off in quick almost ho-hum fashion with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing. Meatheaded and derivative as it is ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is hardly the nadir as hollow corporate products go; certainly its nowhere near as aggressively off-putting as the ""Transformers"" movies the other action-figure adaptations in the Hasbro universe. The dialogue has improved markedly since the earlier outing and the lensing and editing while hardly models of coherence just about manage to avoid excessive jumpiness. Andrew Menzies production design with sets standing in for everything from a Tokyo skyscraper to a Nepalese monastery proves resourceful within the confines of a largely New Orleans-shot production. With the exceptions of the often mesmerizing Lee and the ever-reliable Johnson the performances are merely serviceable. G.I. Joe Retaliation Reviewed at AMC Century City 15 Los Angeles March 26 2013.

TWITTER Jon M. Chus action-packed sequel starring Dwayne Johnson Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum follows the elite macho soldiers in a worldwide battle against the bad guys. So fetishistic about high-powered weapons that it qualifies as an NRA wet dream G.I. Joe Retaliation pretty accurately reflects the franchises comic book and cartoon origins which is both a good and a bad thing good if youre a 12- to 15-year-old boy bad if youre just about anyone else. Still Hasbros concept about elite macho soldiers fighting weird elusive villains has hit the mark with target audiences over the decades and Dwayne Johnsons presence atop this sequel to the 2009 action nonclassic likely will propel it past its predecessors 302 million worldwide box-office take. PHOTOS Senior Superheroes 19 Action Stars Kicking Butt Past 50 After spiriting a defector out of -- where else? -- North Korea Duke (a returning Channing Tatum) and Roadblock (Johnson) relax by -- what else? -- playing a video game. However theres more trouble afoot. When last seen the president of the United States had been displaced by a look-alike imposter installed by the sinister world domination-seeking organization Cobra and now its time to cash in on the charade. Sending the G.I. Joes into Pakistan to remove some nukes the faux president then betrays Americas best fighters by attacking their base leaving just four survivors Duke Roadblock Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). While the president calls for global disarmament the better to victimize those who might comply more bad guys materialize including Snake Eyes (Ray Park of Darth Maul fame) and the ferocious Firefly (the imposing Ray Stevenson from HBOs Rome). A whole Japanese subplot involving ninjas and a strange guru (RZA of Wu-Tang Clan) seems like filler to allow the Joes time to lick their wounds and figure out how to get to the alleged president. But no matter what director Jon M. Chu (the last two Step Up films the Justin Bieber concert film Never Say Never) never forgets that his primary obligations are to whip together some sort of action sequence every 10 or 15 minutes and to make sure to provide close-ups and if possible practical demonstrations of as many fancy pieces of artillery as possible to make the heavy-ammo crowd drool. PHOTOS 26 of Hollywoods Most Popular Athletes-Turned-Actors So in the midst of cartoonishly scripted and indifferently presented scenes devoted to good-guy intelligence work and bad-guy thuggery are two big scenes that are eye-popping for different reasons. The first nearly an hour in is one that makes the whole Japanese side story pay off; opposing teams of fearsome ninja fighters treat sheer rock mountainsides almost as parkour athletes use walls jumping down into voids throwing zip-line cords across great distances in order to slide from one cliff to another many of them plummeting to their doom. Its like Spider-Man times 10 in a dazzling sequence in which conceptual novelty is strongly served by visual compositions and action choreography well beyond anything else in the film. The other scene is equally arresting but in a rather more dubious way. Having agreed to help the G.I. Joe squad get to the evil president retired Joe founder Gen. Joe Colton (Bruce Willis) invites the warriors to his home to offer them access to his personal arsenal. In every drawer cabinet closet and desk is a hidden trove of ever-more awesome weapons a veritable candy store of firepower thats photographed in the lethal-hardware equivalent of a Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. The sequence climaxes and epitomizes the films extreme idolatry at the altar of the gun a posture that will be a massive turn-on for the target audience but might give pause to those who still care to remember that the Dark Knight Rises shooting happened less than a year ago. EXCLUSIVE VIDEO G.I. Joe Retaliation Featurette Digs Into the Explosive 3D Chu and screenwriters Rhett Reese amp; Paul Wernick (Zombieland) clearly know their intended audience and what it wants a less mechanized more human-based younger brother to Hasbros other cash-cow franchise Transformers. Injecting the ever-personable Johnson into the proceedings helps a good deal the returning Tatum and Byung-hun Lee (as Storm Shadow) are easy on the eyes and for nonfans its by some distance easier to take any of the Transformers entries. G.I. Joe Retaliation was held back from its original 2012 release date so it could be converted to 3D. Perhaps the bean counters know best as to whether this was worth the effort but aesthetically the effect is negligible and sometimes especially when the framing of action is tight quite awkward and off-putting. This is 3D that does not enhance a film that was not originally intended for it. The visual effects and CGI are highly variable with one brief sequence toward the end of a major world capital being destroyed looking laughably cartoonlike.

After the relative box-office disappointment of 2009s daft but enjoyable The Rise of Cobra it looks as though some bright spark at Joe HQ decided that what the series needed was to lose its fun post-Team America self-awareness and replace it with unironic jingoism military-fetish hardware and heavy-handed nods to real world events.The film kicks off with the assassination of the Pakistani president and a night-time raid into enemy territory which makes Zero Dark Thirty look subtle and ends at an explosive nuclear disarmament conference. In between were treated to some extremely haphazard plotting as Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) and his band of largely interchangeable free-world freedom fighters battle the evil forces of Cobra by gallivanting about shouting hoo-rah and randomly blowing things up.Perceptive readers will note the absence in that synopsis of any mention of the first films star - and this films poster boy - Channing Tatum. Theres a reason for that but frankly its so utterly bemusing that we wont reveal it here. Lets just say that this bonkers switcheroo - and an unexpectedly sublime mid-film Himalayan wire-fu sequence - represent the only two reasons to see GI Joe Retaliation.

The plot is trite and the cliches abound. The only real humour comes from Willis the 3D is unsubtle and apart from the wire fight scene it is a totally forgettable film. It ends with the bad guy getting away and an obvious set up for a thrid film. If they do make one I wont bother going to see it. A poor 2 star film.
