Curry Tamala Jones Tiny Lister John Witherspoon; Director Steve Carr; Author Ice Cube; Release Date Wide 01/12/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 92; MPAA Rating R; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted January 14 2000 -- 1200 AM EST As a screenwriter Ice Cube has a gift for creating rowdy riotously self-absorbed flakes - fools who think theyre players. For a while Next Friday the sequel to the 1995 sleeper hit ""Friday"" dawdles with amiable shagginess as it follows Craig (played once again by Ice Cube who also produced) the chunky impassive hero out to the L.A. suburbs where he goes to live with his Uncle Elroy (Don ""DC"" Curry) and cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) who have used their lottery winnings to escape South Central. The movie is a comic cavalcade of screwups and hucksters most of whom are so myopically focused on the pleasures and problems right in front of them that theyre completely cut off from the larger world. Asked if he has any of his lottery booty left Day-Day a vain petty scoundrel who has abandoned his pregnant girlfriend because he fantasizes that hes a righteous pimp replies with utter seriousness ""I dunno - I done went and bought some shoes."" As long as Ice Cube is scripting moments like that or the one in which the motormouth hedonist Uncle Elroy says ""Im about to show yall who the real Puff Daddy is"" as he lights up a cigar stuffed with reefer ""Next Friday"" in its winning slovenly way evokes the early Cheech and Chong movies. The first ""Friday"" had a lackadaisical ""day in the life of the hood"" structure that felt true to the world it was portraying. It also had Chris Tucker who in his breakout role gave the movie a hotfoot. He isnt in this one but that might not have mattered so much had the gap been filled by another wild-card actor or two. Instead we get a dull revenge plot in which Craig attempts to escape the gargantuan local bully Debo (Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr.) whom he beat up at the end of ""Friday."" The movie starts high gradually bogs down then dies. Still theres no doubt that Ice Cube is a spry distinctive talent behind the camera. Ive always found his acting a bit too consciously stoic but ""The Players Club"" the 1998 movie he wrote and directed was vibrant and funny and dramatic and the best parts of ""Next Friday"" are like its predecessor the raw stuff of a comedy of urban manners.

Starring Ice Cube Mike Epps John Witherspoon and Don ""DC"" Curry. Directed by Steve Carr. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Next Friday"" is an extremely funny movie and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during ""Friday"" the first installment of this franchise. It stars and was written by rap star and actor Ice Cube which means a lot of middle-aged white people will go no further than this sentence. They will assume that ""Next Friday"" is a niche picture pitched to an audience that doesnt include them. Wrong. This movie is a find a delight for adults of all ages -- as funny as ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"" though without the latters cruelty. ""Next Friday"" has the inventive silliness of those two movies the comic spirit the vulgarity and the nonstop laughs. The picture which opens today is the best comedy of the decade -- for the time being. ""Friday"" ended with Craig (Cube) a young man from South Central beating up a huge guy named Debo (Tommy Lister Jr.) who was subsequently thrown into prison. Now Debo has broken out and to avoid another showdown Craig is sent to the suburbs to stay with his uncle Elroy (Don ""DC"" Curry) and cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps). Sound funny yet? ""Next Friday"" is not a comedy of situation. Its one of character. Everyone with the exception of straight man Craig is drawn in extreme terms and the actors most of them alumni of the stand-up comedy circuit give full- out performances. Craigs father (John Witherspoon) is a dogcatcher who talks a mile a minute usually about something disgusting. He tells Craig in detail that he looks forward to his absence so that he and Craigs mom can walk around the house naked and she can give him a lap dance. He eats spicy food and makes mad dashes to the nearest bathroom. Uncle Elroy is another exaggerated creation. He owns a big purple house in the suburbs thanks to winning the Lotto. He struts around in a gold robe calling himself ""the king"" and has a much younger wife who is immediately sex-crazed for Craig. When Craig walks into his uncles bedroom the ambience is like the inside of a sex shop. Who would ever have expected that Ice Cube whose screen demeanor is so serious had such a silly side? He has written a tightly constructed low farce with humor that borders on absurdist and Steve Carr in his feature directing debut doesnt miss an opportunity. He chooses camera angles for maximum comic impact and the performances are just right straddling the line between the real and the ridiculous. The story doesnt matter though there is one -- Cube and his cousin have to come up with 3900 in taxes or else Uncle Elroy will lose his house. The important thing is that the story serves as a clothesline for gags and the gags never stop coming. ..

Splendid idea. Next Friday is a loud low-level candy-colored sequel to the juvenile 1995 comedy Friday. Produced and written by Ice Cube who is also one of its stars it is notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational drugs and irresponsible sex. Most of the principal female characters are either sexually voracious sexually promiscuous pregnant out of wedlock or angrily bent on revenge. The principal villains of the film are members of a Hispanic family who are violent criminals and bullies; the secondary villain is a black man who has escaped from prison. From the standpoint of the films characters the butt of comedy is a foul-mouthed Korean woman Miss Ho-Kym (Amy Hill). Even on its own terms which include soundtrack credits for Ice Cube Wyclef Jean and Wu-Tang Clan among others Next Friday directed by Steve Carr can stake no claim to high achievement. The film picks up the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) at a time when Debo the hulking menace of Friday has just broken out of the Los Angeles County Mens Central Jail. Craigs father (John Witherspoon) still characterized mainly by his penchant for hot sauce and his bathroom habits decides it would be a good idea to dispatch Craig from South-Central Los Angeles to live in the suburbs with his Uncle Elroy (Don Curry known as D. C.) and his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps). Uncle Elroy nearly broke though a lottery winner lives with the steamy Suga (Kym E. Whitley) across the way from the vicious and terrifying Joker brothers. Day-Day and his BMW are under siege from the angry pregnant DWana (Tamala Jones) and her henchwoman Baby D (Robin Allen). So on the very day that Uncle Elroy faces the seizure of his 230000 home for a 3900 tax delinquency Debo (Tommy Lister Jr. known as Tiny) has stowed away in Mr. Joness dogcatchers truck en route to Rancho Cucamonga so he can wreak vengeance on Craig. Craig meanwhile has run afoul of the Joker brothers (Jacob Vargas Lobo Sebastian and Rolando Molina) and their pit bull while falling for their beautiful and decent sister Karla (Lisa Rodriguez). Day-Day and his pal Roach (Justin Pierce) have lost their jobs in a record shop. Now its up to Craig to save the day which involves a burglary. But since it is a theft from the Joker brothers who are thieves and drug dealers themselves the film takes the position that its O.K. Naturally everyone converges on the Jokers home at the same time. The conclusion has energy without much originality. Next Friday is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It involves coarse language violence drug use and sexual situations. NEXT FRIDAY Directed by Steve Carr; written by Ice Cube based on characters created by Ice Cube and D. J. Pooh; director of photography Christopher J. Baffa; edited by Elena Maganini; music by Terence Blanchard; production designer Dina Lipton; produced by Ice Cube; released by New Line Cinema. Running time 93 minutes. This film is rated R.

Gary Gray and co-star Chris Tucker new pic plays like a series of uneven comic riffs that were invented on a day-to-day basis during filming. There are a few good laughs but few surprises in ""Next Friday"" an amiably unfocused sequel that adheres to the formula established by its surprisingly profitable 1995 predecessor. Very much like ""Friday"" which launched the screen careers of director F. Gary Gray and co-star Chris Tucker new pic plays like a series of uneven comic riffs that were invented on a day-to-day basis during filming. That didnt hurt the original which generated a huge following on video and cable and it shouldnt keep the followup from scoring impressive B.O. numbers and generating brisk ancillary biz. Smoky the aptly named pothead played by Tucker in the previous pic has been written out of the franchise. (His absence is explained in a throwaway scrap of dialogue ""He went into rehab last month"") But rapper-actor Ice Cube once again makes a winning impression as Craig Jones an underemployed slacker who somehow maintains his cool while responding to the wild goings-on around him. The first ""Friday"" which Ice Cube co-wrote with DJ Pooh followed Craig through an unusually eventful day in the life of his South Central L.A. neighborhood. Pic ended happily albeit incredibly with Craigs two-fisted defeat of a monstrous bully Debo (Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr.) and the hopeful suggestion of happily-ever-aftering. As the sequel begins however its clear that Debo -- newly escaped from prison -- wants payback. So Craigs dogcatcher father (John Witherspoon) brings his son to Rancho Cucamonga to hide out in the posh suburban home of Craigs Uncle Elroy (Don ""DC"" Curry) until Debo is recaptured. Uncle Elroy flush with lottery winnings and preeningly proud of his upscale status greets his nephew with open arms. But he warns the young man to keep his hands off Suga (Kym E. Whitley) his zaftig trophy wife. Suga not surprisingly goes to great lengths to keep her hands on Craig. ""Next Friday"" -- which credits Ice Cube as solo scriptwriter -- is something short of a romp. Indeed the pic tends to amble along at the pace of a bemused tourist on a sightseeing expedition and pauses repeatedly to introduce various supporting characters Day-Day (Mike Epps) Uncle Elroys none-too-bright son; Miss Ho-Kym (Amy Hill) a friendly and foul-mouthed next-door neighbor; Roach (Justin Pierce) Day-Days stoner buddy; and DWana (Tamala Jones) Day-Days angry and pregnant ex-girlfriend. A trio of high-rolling Latino drug dealers -- Joker (Jacob Vargas) Lil Joker (Lobo Sebastian) and Baby Joker (Rolando Molina) -- and their beautiful sister (Lisa Rodriguez) also figure in the mix. Some sensitive souls likely will be infuriated by the stereotypical depiction of the Jokers and their sibling. But just about every character in ""Next Friday"" is a type of some kind and the pic is too larky and goofy to come across as mean-spirited. Early on Craigs father slips in his front lawn and lands on a pile of dog excrement. That pretty much sets the tone for the movies humor. While director Steve Carr gives his actors plenty of free rein -- and in a few cases just enough rope to hang themselves -- he wisely refrains from extreme gross-out jokes. On the other hand there are relatively few moments of sidesplitting hilarity although several scenes merit at the very least an approving guffaw or satisfied smile. Unlike many recent comedies aimed primarily at African-American audiences ""Next Friday"" stands a better-than-fair chance of attracting a crossover audience. Ice Cube radiates his usual low-key charisma -- though he was certainly better showcased in ""Three Kings"" -- and he interacts effectively with his more raucous co-stars. Once again Witherspoon steals every scene that isnt nailed to the floor as Craigs father and Lister huffs and puffs with more ferocity than anyone this side of the Big Bad Wolf. The enjoyably eclectic soundtrack runs the gamut from golden oldies (David Bowies ""Fame"" and the Gap Bands ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"") to fresh contemporary material. Chief among the latter ""Chin Check"" the first new cut in 10 years by the temporarily reunited N.W.A (with Snoop Dogg filling in for the late Easy-E) and Ice Cubes rendition (with Mack 10 and Ms. Toi) of the chart-bound ""You Can Do It."" Other production values are adequate across the board. Next FridayProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Cubevision production. Produced by Ice Cube.
