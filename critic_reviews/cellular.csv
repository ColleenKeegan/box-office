Based on a story by Phone Booth writer Larry Cohen (bit of a theme emerging here) it sees science teacher Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger) snatched from her home by rent-a-thug Jason Statham and locked in a room with a smashed-up phone. Jessica pieces it back together but can only reach one line the mobile phone of carefree young Ryan (Chris Evans - no not that one). Jessica begs Ryan to go to the police station - but theres no time for cops when she spots the kidnappers speeding off to grab her son and later her husband who has something they desperately want. And so Ryan must race against the clock to outwit the baddies with Jessicas help holding up phone stores and stealing Porsches as obstacles demand.If this sounds like an episode of TVs 24 thats probably no coincidence. This merrily exploits the publics love of clock-tickers that force opposites to collaborate to save the day. But fun as it is Cellular lacks gravitas. Basingers melodramatic hysterics are too theatrical to convince and potential suspense is often drained by a cheery soundtrack and corny dialogue. Then theres the tendency to over-indulge admittedly humorous supporting characters such as William H Macys facepack-wearing cop and Rick Hoffmans idiotic Porsche driver. Ultimately his peppers its drama with so much comedy it fails as a truly nail-biting thriller. A guilty giggle for fans of the genre.

"Cellular | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cellular ) Cellular (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Cellular is a nearly perfectly executed ""high concept"" thriller that like Speed and Phone Booth uses a gimmicky setup but is paced so relentlessly that you dont have time to dwell upon the obvious implausibility of the situation. (It should be noted that Larry Cohen was involved in writing both Cellular and Phone Booth.) When you step in to a theater to see David R. Ellis movie you either agree to buy into the premise or not. In the latter case you should look for another film. In the former youre in for an entertaining ride. Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger) is a high school science teacher living a comfortable life in a non-descript Southern California community. One day after sending her son Ricky (Adam Taylor Gordon) off to school her routine is rudely interrupted. A group of thugs led by the implacable Greer (Jason Statham) breaks into her home kidnaps her and whisks her away to an unknown location. Once there she is locked in an attic. Theres a phone there but Greer smashes it with a sledge hammer to make sure she cant use it to facilitate an escape. But the phone isnt quite dead. By touching two wires together Jessica is able to make phone calls to random numbers. When she gets Ryan (Chris Evans) on the line theres something in her distressed voice that keeps him from hanging up. At first he doesnt believe her but he nevertheless agrees to take her story to a cop named Mooney (William H. Macy) who listens patiently to the story but is then distracted. As a result its Ryan to the rescue when Greers thugs head over to Rickys school to add the boy to their hostage collection. Acting on information from Jessica about where to find her son he ends up in a race with the bad guys to see who can find Ricky first. Any possible cell phone clichA(c) you can possibly imagine comes into play here a dying battery poor signal strength crossed signals ringing at inopportune moments and dropped calls. Because its imperative that Jessica and Ryan are not disconnected (she cant reconnect because the broken phone doesnt dial normally and he cant call her because the criminals will answer) Cellular gains much of its tension by maneuvering Ryan around all sorts of obstacles to keep the call active while soliciting help from the police looking for Jessica and trying to prevent her son and husband from joining her. (At one point he ends up at a cell phone store where mindless salesmen tell him to take a number and stand in line while the ""low battery"" warning light on his phone flashes.) And when Greer becomes aware of Ryans existence thats when things start to get ugly. Cellular also contains other staples of the action genre including car chases foot chases shoot outs fights and an annoying character whose only role is to provide comic relief (Rick Hoffman). This isnt really an actors movie so its no surprise that there arent any stand-out performances. Kim Basinger and Chris Evans are adequate - they do what the script requires of them but not a lot more. William H. Macy essentially plays the kind of role he has become known for - a reluctant unlikely hero. All he really wants to do is open a day spa but circumstances force him to proceed with a dogged investigation that involves him with Ryan in the over-the-top climax. Jason Statham a veteran ""hard guy"" from British gangster films is perfectly cast as the chief villain. With his nasty sneer and chilling stare its hard to find someone more intimidating. Cellular reliably entertains for its 90-minute running time. Using the clever premise it packs a lot of thrills into a short space while keeping the level of tension consistently high. Theres time for exposition but never so much that it breaks the action for too long. The storyline is cleverly developed but not overplotted. In addition even though the cell phone is used as a multi-functional tool it never does anything more than a real-world phone (circa 2004) can do. It takes pictures and video makes calls and stores numbers. And like the device I have clipped to my belt it can be as annoyingly inconsistent as it is liberating. Cellular is a popcorn movie but you may end up gripping the armrest before you have emptied the bag. And dont forget to turn off your own phone - if it rings during the movie youll jump two feet.

"Cellular Hanging On for Dear Life washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Cellular Hanging On for Dear Life Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 10 2004 SOMETIMES youre just ready for dumb fun. (Of course some of us are always ready for it.) Which may be why ""Cellular"" is so easy to watch and so surprisingly gripping. Yes a movie about a cell phone can be entertaining. It certainly hits most of us where we live and all too many of us where we drive. The movie starts out as stupid as stupid does with two less-than-involving plots. In one Kim Basinger is Jessica Martin a married mom who is suddenly kidnapped; and in the second a ""lovable lughead"" with six-pack abs named Ryan (Chris Evans) is being told by his girlfriend that hes a self-obsessed narcissist. You know these two are going to be connected especially with a title like ""Cellular."" It happens when Ryans cell phone rings and Jessica tells him about her plight. Ryan doesnt believe her story but hes nice enough to pass the cell phone to . . . overworked weary police officer Mooney (an amusingly downcast William H. Macy) who refers Ryan to the robbery unit upstairs. Ryan cant find anyone up there. It seems hell have to deal with this call. If Jessica is telling the truth hes got no choice but to be a hero. For one thing the goons are on their way to her sons school to abduct little Ricky (Adam Taylor Gordon). Yes she has a son named Ricky Martin. Now heres the hook. Jessica a science teacher is locked in the attic. But she has pieced together a shattered telephone salvaged from the beating that one of her abductors (Jason Statham a nice Englishman doomed to a career of these roles) just gave it. She has to hold two flimsy wires together to make it work. Reaching Ryans cell phone was a fluke. The connection could be lost at any moment. So while Ryans driving at top speed through clogged traffic and chasing dangerous men he has to make sure he doesnt lose the call. It should come as no surprise that Larry Cohen (whose screen story was the basis for debuting writer Chris Morgans screenplay) also wrote ""Phone Booth"" another movie in which two people are caught up in a suspenseful situation with a phone line between them. He obviously knows the territory. Despite a story thats hardly the most credible ever conceived -- ranging from Ryan holding up cell phone store employees at gunpoint so he can get a battery charger to the incredibly dumb reasons behind the kidnapping -- ""Cellular"" is always charged. Its adroit use of suspense makes you overlook the silliness. And if nothing else Washingtonians can appreciate the spectacle of drivers using handheld cell phones legally. CELLULAR (PG-13 89 minutes) -- Contains violence and obscenity. Area theaters.

"Cellular No Hang-Ups washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Cellular No Hang-Ups Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 10 2004 There ought to be a small place in heaven for movies like ""Cellular."" Now they almost never make them but from the 30s through the 60s they were a Hollywood staple efficient programmers taut tight killer Bs churned out in the hundreds unstudied and unloved but perfect on the undercard of a double feature then gone forever in a week. I doubt ""Cellular"" will last much longer than that (though of course movies now have afterlives on tape or disc) but I enjoyed every one of its 89 minutes. Its so brisk its like a whiff of ammonia after a month in a treacle factory. The premise Stay on the line or somebody dies. In Los Angeles Brentwood neighborhood a middle-age woman (played by Kim Basinger) is brutally kidnapped for reasons that make no sense to her. She is after all a science teacher married to a real estate agent. Her abductors take her to a safe house then ask her over and over where ""it"" is and she has no idea what they are talking about. Then they set out to pick up her son and her husband. Before her kidnappers seal her in the attic they smash a phone on the wall. Shes a science teacher remember? She understands a little about wires. So she tries to reassemble the phone splicing this exposed copper end to that and ends up somehow getting a random call out to . . . a surfer dude (Chris Evans). Like excuse me lady I have you know a life Yeah youre kidnapped like Im a movie star. Uh-huh. Now surfs up time to hang ten and . . . oh please the crying come on you dont think Im going to fall for that? The movie is built around the fragile transmission an apt metaphor of our fractured age. Its about people talking on the phone but always at risk The technology itself or the emotional connection between conversants is dangerously volatile. Joe Bob Briggs the legendary outlaw movie reviewer once said his highest accolade for a horror film was that ""Anybody can die at any moment."" This is the cellular version of that profound concept Any call can be cut off at any moment and when that happens pretty lady in attic then her son then her husband all will be dead and it all hangs on this silly kid with the pecs and the tattoos and the 20-year-olds horndog lust for anything with breasts. The plot is the brainchild of old pro screenwriter Larry Cohen (first credit 1947) who is reported to have pointed out that its exactly the opposite of his last movie 2002s ""Phone Booth."" In that one a guy was on the phone but couldnt go anywhere. In this one hes on the phone but he can go everywhere; he just doesnt know where he should go. He goes to the cops which brings a retiring desk officer named Mooney into the story well played by old pro William H. Macy (first credit 1978) under a shellac of perfectly cut and sprayed cop hair (where do the guys get those haircuts and why do they all have them?). Moon as he is called by his supervisor approaches the mystery from the policemans angle trying to track the woman through traffic records trying to make sense of mounting discrepancies trying to get it to add up. Both Basinger and Evans are good as they cling to each other through the airways but whats so brilliant about the concept is how it turns on the feebleness of the most ubiquitous piece of technology in America today. These little plastic beggars always let you down and everyone knows it. Treachery is their nature their point their only thrill in life. They live to fail and up in cell-phone Valhalla they drink grog chase wenches and laugh at the trauma theyve caused. That little beep signifying Low Battery It always comes on the one call per month that really matters. The movie plays expertly with that anxiety. The director new pro David R. Ellis (first credit 1996) working from Chris Morgans screenplay from Cohens idea manages the action exceedingly well as through thin and thick poor Ryan must above all keep the phone alive. The movie lays out his ordeal by dying battery against the frustrations of everyday life so hes always fighting traffic lines in stores construction projects rude jerks in Porsches tunnels that will smother the signal to keep the signal hot. (""Speed"" had much the same underlying idea The bus had to stay at 50 mph.) Meanwhile as Ryan races across the blighted precincts of Los Angeles trying to warn first Jessicas son and then her husband he comes closer and closer to the very bad people behind it all particularly the Brit brute Jason Stratham who always makes a nasty villain. This unpretentious little bit of superior craftsmanship will be utterly mesmerizing to two kinds of people in particular those who love cell phones and those who hate them. Cellular (89 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 rated but seems very close to the R line in its violence and psychological brutality.

By Ruthe Stein Published 400 am Friday September 10 2004 Cellular Thriller. Starring Kim Basinger William H. Macy and Chris Evans. Directed by David Ellis. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As the brand of thriller where ordinary people are in peril and forced to take extraordinary risks ""Cellular"" is distressingly predictable and not a tad scary. But as a parody of the genre its a scream like the ""Scream"" franchise only funnier. Its as if all the ingredients for a thriller coagulated into Silly Putty. Out of gratitude to be able to laugh out loud in a theater after a spate of unfunny summer comedies Im prepared to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and assume they were going for the funny bone. They might at least have signaled it by calling the movie ""Cellular"" Not that there arent signs of their intentions such as the presence of William H. Macy as a goofy Los Angeles cop on the verge of turning in his badge to open a day spa. Officer Mooney tests beauty products under the watchful eye of his wife. His face is slathered in a green algae facial mask when he has to dash off to investigate the kidnapping of Brentwood soccer mom Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger). The perils of Jessica are apparent in Basingers continually quivering lower lip. Jessica is no dummy. Shes a science teacher a fact announced in the first scene so it must be significant. Dumped in a hovel by the bad guys who rip out the phone shes soon busy connecting the loose wires with all the ingenuity of the Apollo 13 crew. Darn if she doesnt ring a random cell phone belonging to a genial screw-up named Ryan (Chris Evans) out driving on an errand for his former girlfriend who broke up with him because he cant do anything right. Jessica has to convince Ryan that her life is at stake if he hangs up. The similarity to the plot of ""Phone Booth"" is no accident. Both movies come from stories by the same writer Larry Cohen who shamelessly recycles his ideas figuring probably correctly that audiences wont notice. ""Cellular"" is a lot more eventful than its predecessor which was pretty much confined to a telephone booth. But Ryan can go all over the place on his cell -- a device ideally suited to the mobility of a movie camera. When his battery runs low Ryan dashes into a store for a replacement going to the head of the line by brandishing a gun he found in a stolen security car. Did I mention the extraordinary means people go to in movies like this? The people Ryan runs into -- sometimes literally -- embody the wackiness of Los Angeles. He steals his second car with the license plate WL SU YOU 2 from a pompous lawyer heard bragging about his new convertible on his cell phone. Another driver -- an overdressed and overly made up woman of a certain age -- almost causes Ryan to lose his critical connection because of the loud rock music on her radio. When he signals her to turn it down she thinks hes flirting with her. Evans recently seen in the forgettable ""Not Another Teen Movie"" perfects Ryans hang-loose demeanor. Hes the best foil for Macy since Frances McDormand. The scene where they do battle with the kidnappers is right out of the Keystone Kops. Basinger doesnt fare as well because shes not given much to do besides look distressed. Later in the movie she shows how Jessicas knowledge of human anatomy would give an advantage to any action heroine. Basinger finally gets to emote when she meets her savior. ""Ryan"" she says with great emotion. ""Jessica"" he replies with equal drama. A few more times repeating each others names and they might have replicated the famous ""John-Marcia"" comedy sketch. -- Advisory This film contains violent scenes and sexual references.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review William H. Macy Kim Basinger or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- With the passing of Labor Day weekend the really big movies -- featuring household names gigantic budgets and baring the burden of Oscar hopes and pretensions -- are just around the corner. But now its the perfect time for a popcorn chomping action/thriller to squeeze into the last lazy hazy days of summer.And ""Cellular"" directed by former stuntman David R. Ellis is such a movie.Starring Kim Basinger Chris Evans and William H. Macy ""Cellular"" takes place in the laid-back fairly privileged world of West L.A. where for many people a bad surf day or your favorite manicurist being on vacation qualifies as major crises. But Jessica Martin (Basinger) has bigger problems.Shortly after dropping her young son off at his school bus stop five men smash through her kitchen door gun down her housekeeper and kidnap her all in the matter of seconds. Shes transported to an empty dusty attic in an unknown location. Before she can even catch her breath one of the men bangs into the room with a baseball bat and smashes one of the few objects in the room a wall phone. Satisfied that she is now totally cut off from the outside world he leaves.Jessica is not only scared out of her mind she cannot think of a single reason why anyone would want to kidnap her. Her only clue is a reference to some kind of information involving her husband -- who works in real estate -- and she is being used as bait to make him cooperate.Good connectionNow alone and terrified Jessica hears a faint dial tone coming from the bits and pieces of the shattered phone starts randomly attaching wires together and -- of course -- is connected to a cell phone owned by Ryan (Evans) a poster boy for California beach living. He mocks her pleas for help at first but he reluctantly agrees to go to the closest police station and hand over the phone to anyone wearing a uniform. William H. Macy is a police officer and Chris Evans is the man who received Basingers call in ""Cellular.""On the way -- while their conversation continues -- it dawns on Ryan that Jessica is really in danger and telling the truth. Now drawn into the drama he arrives at a police station and confronts an officer named Mooney (Macy). Mooney is counting down the days to his retirement and absent-mindedly passes Ryan off to another department. Only later does he realize that Ryan is involved in a life or death situation and throws himself into the case.Thats the basic set-up for this well-crafted story created by screenwriter Larry Cohen who also brought us another film involving telephones ""Phone Booth."" Cohen left the actual screenwriting to newcomer Chris Morgan.The drama ""Speed""-like occurs during a tight time frame -- just a few hours. But one of the films nice devices is having the two central characters never knowing or even seeing each other. (In fact actors Basinger and Evans made it a point to never meet face-to-face until the very end of filming.) That idea pays off since there really is a feeling of anonymity between the characters that grows into a deep connection by the films climax.Sharp actingThey two characters build a unique bond of trust -- and create their own private world -- by being connected only through their fragile link. But the true beauty of this film is how the dramatic tension builds to almost unbearable levels only to be snapped by a bit of humor and then over and over takes up once again.Ryan grows from an apathetic slacker into a quick thinking man of action and Jessica transforms from a high school science teacher and wife and mother into a courageous person who refuses to be a victim.Basinger once again proves why she won an Oscar (""L.A. Confidential"") and Evans is not only suitably handsome he also displays real acting chops. As always Macy takes what could be an average everyday role and turns it into a tour-de-force.""Cellular"" will unlikely win any major awards or rock your world but its a fun ride and well worth the trip to your local cineplex.""Cellular"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Despite some dead spots Cellular connects in the end - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Despite some dead spots Cellular connects in the end By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 10 2004 Any Kim Basinger movie whose first words are ""Mommy will you still be a science teacher when I get to high school?"" knows its stupid. And so starts the mother-son chat in the first scene of ""Cellular"" a ludicrous little abduction thriller that boasts an entertaining cocktail of gunpowder suspense adrenaline and cheese. I just couldnt hate this movie and I really really tried. Its tightly made and well written in deceptive ways that dont reveal themselves until past the halfway point.The minute after Basingers Jessica Martin a biology teacher puts her son on the school bus three tough-looking thugs burst into her Brentwood Calif. fortress kill her maid promptly throw Jessica in a car and then lock her up in a great big attic where the lead thug (Jason Statham) smashes the phone mounted on the wall. Basingers face looks ready to melt. Nobodys told her why shes suddenly Olivia de Havilland in ""Lady in a Cage."" But Jessicas husband is in danger her son too. So she does what any frantic abductee with a working knowledge of biology would do rub together the wires on a broken landline until she gets not just a dial tone but the cellphone of an actual person.Her hopes for survival rest with a slacking pretty boy named Ryan (Chris Evans) and a strong signal. Before she called he was at the beach trying to fix things with his fed-up girlfriend (Jessica Biel). Why he wonders if Mrs. Martin is in such peril has she called him and not the cops? Well if hes going to ask that then he ought to ask why shes wearing fishnets to frog dissections but never mind. Her desperate pleading voice and his overhearing her chief captor yelling at her have Ryan convinced that something is up.So the movie turns into a race against time as well as a dead battery. Ryan has to stop the thugs from doing heaven knows what to Jessicas family. He holds up a store for a phone charger steals a Ferrari when a truck hits his other stolen car and runs out to the Los Angeles airport to warn Jessicas husband. The movie which David R. Ellis directs works up a lot of laughs and a lot of suspense usually at the same time. One of several cleverly plotted sequences happens at airport security where Ryan has to figure out what to do with the gun in his pocket. (Please dont ask how he got it. This movie raises more tough questions than the SAT.)Evans is part of the movies fun. Hes like the Luke Wilson that would show up to install your cable or put your sofa in the moving van. As Ryan continues to be surprised by his own ingenuity his likability grows.""Cellular"" was written by Chris Morgan and is based on a screen story by the B-movie artist Larry Cohen whose last script was ""Phone Booth."" Whats so absorbing about ""Cellular"" is the way it taunts you to laugh at it when really its in on all the jokes. Jessicas sons name? Ricky. Ricky Martin which Ryan cant believe. The movie also busts up the tension with a sideplot that drags the reliably good William H. Macy as a very nice cop into the action. Naturally its his last day on the force. (Danny Glover must have been unavailable.) But the movie puts its cliches in a headlock The Martin familys mysterious nightmare happens to affect Macys character personally and the annoying first half cleanly dovetails into the juicy second.""Cellular"" is a dumb ""Collateral"" or a talky ""Speed"" a movie that has hilariously resonant ideas about the wild social and urban matrix that is Los Angeles. The city in these films becomes a weird metaphor for the world and a place whose personal history exists in a sort of infinite entertainment repeat which is perfect for a movie that plays like an aerobic ""Night Gallery"" rerun.

"Cellular roamin holiday. Slate Sign In Sign Up Cellular roamin holiday. Cellular roamin holiday. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 9 2004 659 PM Roamin Holiday A thriller without any hang-ups Cellular. By David Edelstein No I dont want to switch long distance providers The gimmick of the crackerjack thriller Cellular (New Line) is hilariously suited to our mobile-communications age and for the epicenter of mobile blabbing Los Angeles. A Brentwood woman Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger) gets brutally kidnapped and tossed into an attic. Theres a phone on the wall up there--why I cant tell you You dont dwell on stuff like that in a good thriller. But just when shes about to pick up the receiver the chief kidnapper (Jason Statham) a hulking guy with a buzz cut strolls in and smashes it to bits with a sledgehammer. (Id have just slid it off the wall and brought it downstairs--but you dont dwell on stuff like that in a good thriller.) Jessica hears a dial tone and realizes that the connection hasnt been broken so she taps the wires against each other hoping to get through to someone--anyone. And she does to the cell phone of Ryan (Chris Evans) a studly good-for-nothing on the Santa Monica Pier surrounded by oodles of babes on roller skates. Hes not a guy whod normally buy a line like ""Help me Ive been kidnapped I think theyre going to kill me""--but hearing Basinger whine for like five minutes without stopping for breath is impressive enough to halt anyone in his tracks. Speaking of not stopping for breath The 75 minutes that follow are relentless. If thrills and spills like the ones in Cellular have been the stuff of melodrama since Pauline was tied to the tracks mobile phones give a filmmaker more opportunities for cross-cutting and more weird hurdles to jump. Ryan goes up a police-station stairwell to the robbery-homicide division--and hes on the verge of losing that precious signal The cell phone flashes ""low battery""--and hes on the verge of losing that precious signal He drives by an obnoxious lawyer and he does lose that precious signal--but the lawyer picks it up on his mobile phone and Ryan steals not only the twerps deluxe Nokia but after his battered vehicle is promptly crushed by a semi his new car. Then Ryan promptly takes off into a tunnel--oh no A tunnel Time to back up into onrushing traffic. ... Advertisement A thriller like Cellular is a kind of exquisite torture machine a contraption engineered to deliver pleasure and pain in just the right proportions. You get squeezed then tickled then jolted. You think youre going to suffocate; then you can breathe; then you find that the grip has suddenly gotten tighter. That all sounds rather kinky I know. But a thriller that isnt kinky isnt much of a thriller. And Cellular has the best kinky phone gimmick since Sorry Wrong Number (1948). This new model converts to a gun Larry Cohen thought it up. Hes the visionary exploitation maven (Its Alive [1974] God Told Me To [1976]) who also wrote the script for Phone Booth (2002) the one about the sniper who kept Colin Farrell on the line for 90 minutes fun for half an hour but obviously stagebound and with an outrageously lame payoff. As rewritten by Chris Morgan Cellular has more balls in the air and more (and better) climaxes. The irresistible William H. Macy plays a hangdog desk sergeant with a brush mustache Hes preoccupied with opening a beauty salon--or as he insists a ""day spa""--but he cant stop thinking about the freaky kid with the cell phone who tried to tell him a woman had been kidnapped. Theres texture galore from an army of bit players caught on the fly (and left in the dust). And Id love to have been the extras casting director on this movie Almost every shot is teeming with nubile California lovelies in minimal dress. Cellular is exciting without being assaultive. As Ryan hurtles from the pier to downtown L.A. to LAX and back to the pier finally tussling himself with the bad guys the action is amazingly fluid. The director David Ellis isnt some young punk He has been a stunt coordinator and second unit director on some big features. Im grateful to A.O. Scott for alerting me in 2003 to Ellis Final Destination 2 a remarkable piece of craftsmanship--and remarkably cruel too full of intricate and splattery set pieces. Theres nothing so sadistic in Cellular but Ellis has the same knack for making a Rube Goldberg machine in which no cog turns no lever twists and no ball drops quite where you expect it. Although Statham--veteran of assorted overdirected Guy Ritchie films and the hero of The Transporter (2002)--has real charisma managing to be magnetic and threatening in the same instant the MacGuffin is forgettable. And so is newcomer Evans as the hero Hes fine from moment to moment but I doubt Id recognize him on the street. But Basinger hits some shuddery notes of grief when the bad guys go after her little son It almost makes up for her bad-mother turn in The Door in the Floor (2004). Her sobbing pleas via that slender silicon fiber give Cellular its core of humanity. You could almost believe that its more than a rollercoaster ride that its about our miraculous modern interconnectedness. Until the cell phone of the jerk at the end of the row goes off. ...

And because plot is the sum total here the alarming holes inconsistencies and impossibilities in Chris Morgans script corrode this drama of distress. Auds will sense the B-pic nonsense early on sending pic to an early B.O. disconnect. The makers of ""Cellular"" may think that their movie couldnt have been made before the cell phone era but its plot involving a Los Angeles kidnapping -- a man who knew too much and innocents drawn into the fray -- is merely a tepid recycling of old film noir chestnuts. And because plot is the sum total here the alarming holes inconsistencies and impossibilities in Chris Morgans script corrode this drama of distress. Auds will sense the B-pic nonsense early on sending pic to an early B.O. disconnect with better signals in ancillary. Screenwriter Larry Cohen wrote the original script (now retaining only story credit) as a kind of companion to his ""Phone Booth"" and his basic premise remains -- a guy receives call on his cell from a kidnapped woman and must remain on the line if hes to stay in touch with her. Long associated with producer Dean Devlin who had intended this to be his tyro directing effort until turning reins over to action-horror specialist David R. Ellis (""Final Destination 2"") ""Cellular"" has none of Cohens trademark subversive humor nor other qualities that would explain attracting the likes of Kim Basinger and William H. Macy. Kidnappers led by Ethan (Jason Statham) nab Brentwood mom and high school science teacher Jessica (Basinger) from her home toss her in a basement of their lair and plan to also grab her son Ricky (Adam Taylor Gordon). A seemingly unrelated comic respite on Santa Monica Pier establishes callow youth Ryan (Chris Evans) and his knack for grabbing vid-pics on his cell phone. Being vets of ""Baywatch"" production crews Ellis and lenser Gary Capo appear to imagine the pier as a site for ""Baywatch The New Generation"" already compromising pics seeming intention to display a wide swathe of the real Los Angeles. Far more problematic is how Jessica is able to not only get a dial tone from a phone bashed to smithereens by Ethan but by somehow knowing to tap two exposed wires together shes able to dial numbers that amazingly reach ... Ryans cell phone. After his initial skepticism Ryan doesnt hang up but goes to the local police station to report the kidnapping to desk cop Mooney (Macy) whos on the verge of retiring and opening a day spa -one of several pallid jokes . Ryan is soon on a wild pursuit of the kidnappers whose threats and plans hes conveniently able to pick up on his end of the line and the rather unsubtle twist is that he must be forced to continually break the law (including a belabored carjacking of the worlds most obnoxious lawyer) in order to rescue Jessica . A whole roster of felonious stunts doesnt prevent Ricky and husband Craig (Richard Burgi) from also being kidnapped but Ryan like a true prototype for a Hollywood hero grows a spine before auds eyes. What drives Ryan down the stretch is triggered by the sort of nasty secret thats such a stock element of Los Angeles noir that its sheer predictability is a bummer. For his part Macy in an actors holiday from his typically more serious projects presents the movies only interesting human dimension as an aging bored cop forced to jump back into action. Evans is likeable but so incredibly capable under incredible circumstances that -- like the ever-burdensome plot around him -- he cant be taken seriously. Basingers role stands as a major comedown from her recent heights in ""The Door in the Floor."" Slick production values sun-drenched widescreen images and a roster of cartoonish folks tied to their cells or cars fills out a thoroughly cliched portrait of Los Angeles whose geographic realities as crucial here as in ""Collateral"" are routinely violated.
