When theyre not eating your food or borrowing your stuff without asking theyre putting your pets in the tumble dryer and slicing up your ex-lovers with a Stanley knife. In this dorm-room spin on Single White Female bland beauty Sarah (Minka Kelly) slowly realises that her roomie Rebecca (Leighton Meester) has become dangerously enamoured of her. Meester plays this mousy maniac as a clingy nuisance; apart from eruptions of violent rage she acts like a jealous girlfriend chastising the object of her obsession for staying out too late and not returning her phone calls. Wheres a real femme fatale like Jennifer Jason Leigh when you need her? The film banks on its target audience being titillated and creeped out by lesbian desire director Christian E Christiansen stages the obligatory makeout session after a full hour of milking Meesters stares for maximum discomfort. This is trash of the tamest variety which elicits a few mild shudders at most.

Whilst the NUT-JOB is actually not taking her medication is neatly explained instead of your straight out of the box ""child hood trauma""... I liked it. Billy Zane was suitably dreadful and deserves his fate in straight to DVD junk. The two leads basically carry the whole thing well and its a mark of the times that the new version SFW the heroine takes ages to click that her roomie has serious psychological problems. And that the psycho doesnt kill everyone who crosses her path... Youre right about it being tame but like UNKNOWN this is a throwback to the 90s where films like this came out every week..

"Roommate movie review Dont move in with Leighton Meester washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On movie review Roommate movie review Dont move in with Leighton Meester Bad girl Leighton Meesters dark side isnt enticing. (Jaimie Trueblood) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday February 5 2011 Theres a decent B-thriller on offer about psychosexual obsession between two young women who while living together in close quarters begin to undergo an eerie transfer of personae. Its called ""_blankSingle White Female"" and its available on Netflix or from Ye Olde Video Shoppe. Theres another B-thriller at large that while laying claim to the same setup neurotic dynamics and whacked-out violence fails miserably in nearly every department - from thrills to homoerotic titillation. ""_blankThe Roommate"" starring TV-minted personalities Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester switches the action from a New York apartment to a dorm at the ""University of Los Angeles"" where Sara (Kelly) has just moved from Des Moines with big dreams and a broken heart. There to lend a sympathetic ear - when shes not busy piercing it herself with alarming sangfroid - is roomie Rebecca (Meester) a troubled little rich girl who latches on to Sara with the carefully calibrated ardor of a well-seasoned stalker. Sara doesnt twig to Rebeccas dark side - where did their pet kittycat go anyway? - until its much much too late. If the sudden jolts of violence arrive with military precision (one half-hour into the movie and at 15-minute intervals thereafter) ""The Roommate"" doesnt have the courage of its pulpy convictions preferring to leave the gore on the floor and its true identity as a lipstick-tinged slasher film in the closet. In its fascination with girl-on-girl action from longing glances and kissing to a climactic catfight thats less lurid than ludicrous ""Roommate"" plays like the ultimate indulgence of leering Hollywood executives eager to ogle pulchritudinous college girls and call it work. Rest assured the only work involved is watching the tiresome parade of flat line readings workmanlike plot ""twists"" and pore-magnifying close-ups. Kelly and Meester hit their marks and look pretty doing it while supporting players Cam Gigandet Billy Zane and Aly Michalka fade into the background so blandly that viewers will never remember they were there. Speaking of forgettables ""Roommate"" was directed without distinction by someone named Christian E. Christian-sen who hails from Denmark. Of course Scandinavia has given the world its share of classic psychological thrillers one in particular that delved deeply into the twinned psyches of two womens relationship. Come to think of it forget ""Single White Female."" Rent Ingmar Bergmans ""_blankPersona"" instead then watch and learn. The Roommate 1/2 (92 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and menace sexual content profanity and teen partying.

Having seen the trailer for The Roommate a few times the decision by Screen Gems to skip press screenings for their college-days ripoff of Single White Female seemed like a solid business decision. After all the film features a skinny crazy doe-eyed girl who develops an unhealthy obsession with another girl who looks a lot like her. There seemed to be some scenes involving bathing some hints at lesbianism. Its not as if this was supposed to be an Oscar vehicle right? Oh right. I wont say that fear of missing the next Black Swan solely motivated me to join other paying customers at the very first theatrical screening of The Roommate near where I live. Heavier factors in my decision were a mild annoyance at being shut out -- Ill see your movie after all Screen Gems -- and the fact that Fridays arent particularly busy days for a movie critic. Also sometimes there is valuable research in seeing exactly what an intended audience looks like. (I expected a youthful demographic texting madly throughout.) The two lovely women who star in The Roommate Minka Kelly (of TVs Friday Night Lights and Parenthood) and Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl Country Strong) both have an old fashioned beauty like the profiles on vintage cameos. Indeed they practically look like sisters. Their high sweet voices almost match as well which comes in handy when whack job Rebecca (Meester) answers the phone late at night pretending to be Sara (Kelly) and deceives her roommates ex-boyfriend into having phone sex. During Rebeccas phone sex scene Sara is off having the real thing with her new college boyfriend Stephen (Burlesques Cam Gigandet who apparently was practicing the fine art of the sexy squint one day and got his face frozen in that position). These scenes choppily edited together are far less compelling than they sound -- shot in extreme close-up they stir the urge to shop for lipstick more than they do the loins. There is a dramatic c omponent missing; if Rebecca ""borrows"" Saras ex who cares? Because get this Sara had made a pact with her ex Jason that the couple would go to college together. But when Sara got into Brown and he didnt she dutifully mortgaged her future to enroll in the fictional University of Los Angeles a place that admitted Jason as well as the possibly bi-polar possibly schizophrenic Rebecca (screenwriter Sonny Mallhi leaves the medical nature of her problems ambiguous perhaps to avoid any psychiatrists getting bent out of shape). And then Brown offered Jason a spot and he took it. Certainly this is a young man who deserves some special attention from Rebecca. Brown might not have been such a good fit for Sara anyway; she seems to be majoring in Project Runway with a minor in jogging. Her design professor played by Billy Zane decides to admit her to an overbooked class after giving her an oily once over. ""You already have two things I cant teach"" he tells her. ""Style and desire."" Would the Ivy League have mentors like that? The movie proceeds with no major surprises. As soon as generous sparkly sweet Sara tells Rebecca about her beloved sister Emily who died when Sara was nine and Rebecca a lonely rich girl says wistfully ""I always wanted to have a sister"" the writing is on the wall. The nice meet the needy and the next thing you know someone in a tank top is going to be throwing someone else in a tank top out a window. I will say that Rebeccas shift from a kitten-cuddling clothes sharing roommate to dangerous stalker happened so abruptly that I wondered if the projectionist had accidentally skipped a reel. But no it was just Mallhi and director Christian Christiansen rushing to get to the sleazy creepy stuff. Which brings me to the company at my matinee four people. There were two young women sitting together. Maybe they were Gossip Girl fans; I just was glad they were there because the other two men in their 50s each sitting in remote corners of the theater looked more like members of the raincoat-flashing demographic. The movie is exploitative schlock; both its stars -- particularly Meester who has something although she herself has perhaps not yet figured out what -- deserve better.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Im always fascinated when a studio thinks a movie it has produced sucks so bad that the suits refuse to screen it for critics. So early this Friday morning I paid up to see The Roommate for myself at a Manhattan multiplex. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The 10 Worst Movies of 2010 Two homeless gentlemen entered separately carrying their blankets. They left in 15 minutes perhaps preferring the raw cold outdoors to the warmth of a theater that emanated such a stench from the big screen. That left me and four teen girls to be firsties at The Roommate. The girls stayed for the whole damn movie but talked incessantly about the films star Leighton Meester and how shes been faring as Blair Waldorf the spoiled heiress she plays weekly on the CWs Gossip Girl. My theory is their chatter was a protective reflex to shield their beloved Mees Blair from being contaminated by the dialogue and situations onscreen. So yes The Roommate -- the umpteenth uncredited remake of 1992s Single White Female -- sucks bad real bad. The plot pivots on poor Sara (Minka Kelly) in Los Angeles fresh from Iowa learning that her college roommate at ULA is Rebecca (Meester) a Beverly Hills girl who is seriously off her meds. She becomes so jealous and overprotective of Sara thats shell KILL to keep Sara all to herself. Ill say no more except that Danish director Christian E. Christiansen has no flair for suspense. And the PG-13 rating tamps down any redeeming sex and violence. The 10 Best Movies of 2010 Out of presumed boredom the teen girls behind me played a game of identifying the actors several cast members being veterans of other CW TV series. ""Thats Liam from 90210"" shrieked one girl when Matt Lanter showed up as Saras phone stalker. ""And look its Aly Michalka from Hellcats"" Even I noted that it was Nina Dobrev the beautiful star if the CWs Vampire Diaries reduced to cameo duty as a former friend of Rebeccas. Is the CW running some kind of indentured servitude scam on young Hollywood? The whole movie looks like it was shot during lunch hour for various CW series. I was saddest of all for Meester a talented actress being severely mistreated by the movies -- Going the Distance Country Strong and now THIS? Get a new agent girl. Im told that The Roommate may make a box-office killing by being the only alternative for the ladies on Super Bowl weekend. Say it isnt so.

Midwesterner Sara (Minka Kelly) arrives at SoCal ""ULA"" campus--the school colors are apparently the cold blue-and-gray endemic to thrillers from the mid-90s--where she meets her new roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester). Sara is at first flattered by the attention of clingy Rebecca unthreatening enough with her curled-up voice and curtains of lank blond hair. But while Rebecca seems content to limit her college experience to her dorm-mate Sara is spread between party-girl friends a hip older lesbian pal an ex-boyfriend and a new suitor (human smirk Cam Gigandet). Equipped with our privileged glimpses of Rebecca self-piercing her ears and punching herself in the mirror a la Mark Wahlberg in Fear we can anticipate each member of Saras social circle as theyre introduced being punished in turn--and we will not leave disappointed. The presence of Billy Zane as Saras fashion-design teacher gives final reassurance that we need not take anything seriously here.

"The Roommate This copycat is as ferocious as a kitten | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Roommate This copycat is as ferocious as a kittenCollegiate thriller plagued by vapid acting and a timid script.Double trouble Minka Kelly left and her disturbed BFF Leighton Meester.  (Jaimie Trueblood)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Feb. 4 2011The Roommate(out of 4)Starring Leighton Meester Minka Kelly and Cam Gigandet. Directed by Christian E. Christiansen. 93 minutes. At major theatres. PGAny movie in which a kitten named Cuddles is put inside a clothes dryer is going to have a certain degree of camp value. ""Feel how nice and warm it is in there"" coos The Roommates villainess to the unsuspecting feline before she shuts the door thereby sealing Cuddles doom.That the one and only Billy Zane -- a reliably cheesy presence in countless B- and C-movies of our day -- appears as a philandering fashion-design instructor should also be enough to push this collegiate thriller into so-bad-its-good territory.Article Continued BelowUnfortunately The Roommate is too timid to make an impression of any kind. Released on Friday without screenings for reviewers the film is the first starring vehicle for Leighton Meester whos raised bitchiness to an art form in her role as poor little rich girl Blair Waldorf on TVs Gossip Girl.Here shes Rebecca a university student who seems to be equally wealthy but is otherwise devoid of Blairs social finesse. Nevertheless Rebecca is initially successful at staking a claim on the affections of her new roommate Sara (Friday Night Lights Minka Kelly). She does this largely by scaring off any other potential BFFs with creepy glares or -- in the case of the flirty dorm-mate played by Aly Michalka -- a violent attack while the other girl is in the shower.That would-be suspense sequence is the closest that The Roommate makes it to a Hitchcock movie which still isnt that close. Besides the few scenes with Zanes lascivious prof and Rebeccas decision to dispatch that kitten when it gets in the way of her bond with Sara the movie fails to embrace its potential as grade-A trash.The mostly vapid performances by Meester and Kelly are one major problem. Since both actresses have such a close physical resemblance to begin with were denied a repeat of the big moment in Single White Female when Jennifer Jason Leighs character -- an obvious model for The Roommates Rebecca -- shows up wearing Bridget Fondas haircut.Efforts to keep Rebeccas transgressions well within the boundaries dictated by the films PG rating also make The Roommate tamer than it ought to be -- in fact the average Gossip Girl episode is more risque. And even though the movie downplays the erotic component of Rebeccas obsession with Sara lest it seem to portray young lesbians as dangerous psychopaths it ends up demonizing the mentally ill instead. Such a lapse in judgment and sensitivity would be more forgivable if the movie had any flair. Instead we can only conclude that poor Cuddles died in vain.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Christiansen. Intheatres on February 1 2011 distributed by Sony Pictures. (Screen Gems) Photo Credit Screen Gems Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A college girl makes a dangerous new friend. BOTTOM LINE A low-grade dim-bulb teen thriller. CAST Leighton Meester Minka Kelly Cam Gigandet LENGTH 133 A timid thriller about a college girl who makes an unpleasant new friend ""The Roommate"" is almost as naive as the coddled students who attend its fictional University of Los Angeles. Its most fiendish moment comes when one girl yanks out anothers bellybutton ring. Not that - anything but that The films cast comes straight from the world of lightweight teen television. Minka Kelly (""Friday Night Lights"") plays Sara Matthews an Iowa freshman with fashion-industry dreams; Leighton Meester (""Gossip Girl"") is her unbalanced roomie Rebecca a Pasadena rich kid with major problems; the boyfriend role goes to Cam Gigandet (""The O.C."") as Stephen a frat bro who plays drums for a post-Coldplay rock band. Together they uphold a long Hollywood tradition of looking way too old and well-dressed to be teenagers. advertisement | advertise on newsday The filmmakers are guessing youve seen enough fright flicks about identity assumers and personal-space invaders - ""Single White Female"" maybe ""Poison Ivy"" - so they dont feel the need to provide a motivation for Rebeccas behavior. Shes just you know crazy which is all the explanation youll get for why she stalks Stephen in the library attacks a professor (Billy Zane fallen far from ""Titanic"") and totally messes up that girls navel. Its a credit to Meester that shes reasonably convincing in her red-rimmed whacked-out moments. But Rebecca spends most of the movie being little more than a nuisance lurking around in a hoodie and glaring at people. She also wears Sarahs necklace without asking.

Christiansen; Author Sonny Mallhi; Release Date Wide 02/04/2011; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted February 4 2011 -- 1200 AM EST Talk about a doppelganger. This dorm-room thriller starring Leighton Meester as Rebecca an unhinged college student who develops a murderous fascination with her roommate (Minka Kelly) is itself a studied almost frighteningly thorough duplicate of 1992s Single White Female. From the premise to nearly all of the subsequent predictable story beats its as if the makers of The Roommate had their own vicarious obsession. The story is simply airlifted cross-country from a New York City apartment building to ULA a fictional Californian institution of higher learning in which all freshman students resemble runway models in their mid-to-late-twenties. Kellys Sara Matthews studies fashion design which is basically an excuse to let the Friday Night Lights actress switch outfits every other scene and use the campus like a catwalk. Populating the university as if its an Abercrombie amp; Fitch training camp might work if the film were willing to delve with real depth into its themes -- namely the fungibility of all these PYTs -- but director Christian E. Christiansen seems unwilling to take advantage of even the one interesting facet of his casting Kelly and Meester with their wide eyes and cheekbones so sharp they would be confiscated by the TSA already look like twins that were separated at birth by television producers. Cam Gigandet (Burlesque) plays Saras default boyfriend smirking and pouting his way through scenes like hes practicing a James Dean impression in a mirror and Kelly plays Sara as such a blank slate that you can almost understand why Rebecca projects so much onto her. Only Meester brings the slightest trace of something fascinating to her role. When she smiles its perfectly located between a sweet display of affection and a snarling warning. Unfortunately her characters creepiness is mostly constrained to sitting alone in the dark and doing lots and lots of inappropriate staring. With few scares and minimal characterization The Roommate is really just a far-below-par thriller that desperately wishes it were a different movie -- a longing it shares with the audience.

"Movie review The Roommate - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The RoommateDont make the mistake of moving in with Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester.February 05 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Leighton Meester left and Minka Kelly star in the thriller ""The... (Jaimie Trueblood / Screen...)A small-town girl comes to the fictional University of Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of being a fashion designer and encounters a roommate who is clingy to the point of psychotic. Starring Minka Kelly as that starry-eyed newcomer and Leighton Meester as her 1000-yard-stare nemesis ""The Roommate"" is a waste all around of young attractive actresses Los Angeles locations and the time of anyone unlucky enough to sit through it.Without tension or suspense the film is too gloomy and chaste to be a naughty exploitation picture but also too brainless to work as anything more real.Directed by Danish filmmaker Christian E. Christiansen from a script by Sonny Mallhi the film largely dispenses with such apparently antiquated notions as character development or back story choosing instead to just sort of dole out information Mad Libs-style as it seems most convenient. A girl off her meds? A previous object of obsession? That sort of info which actually might help to lend depth emotional credibility and logical sense to of all this is just casually tossed out there and then just as carelessly tossed aside.Also left on the table unexplored are issues of reverse class-envy implied by having Meesters wealthy girl a the press notes say the character is from Pasadena but the word itself is never uttered a aspire to the life of a seemingly more carefree Des Moines A(c)migrA(c). For good measure the film also features a self-pierced ear a belly-ring bloodlessly ripped out a fake-Facebook named Frienderz an odd thing for Richard Princes nurse paintings a brief moment of girl-girl kissing and a kitten named Cuddles.For much of ""The Roommates"" early going any deficiencies in Meesters character are signaled largely by the fact that she has meekly limp hair in counterpoint to Kellys luxuriantly bouncy locks. Meester is the brassy belligerent Blair Waldorf on TVs ""Gossip Girl"" and there she often seems to be performing in a slightly different register than the other actors as if she alone is in on the joke. (There was also her scene-stealing sass and vinegar turn in the recent ""Country Strong."")Here her performance often has the feeling of a sports car in neutral. When she punches it for quick changes of tone from manic to wounded or around the bend she shows how much more she is capable of as in a seduction scene with Billy Zane as a skeevy design teacher. Kelly on the other hand remains either bland a or bland but slightly frightened.It is of course obligatory to make some mention of this all seeming oddly familiar something like ""Single White Female The College Years."" Yet that film directed by Barbet Schroeder and adapted for the screen by Don Roos at least had the gleeful conviction of knowing it was slightly camp trash.""The Roommate"" proves that the one thing worse than a crazy stalker roommate is one thats boring predictable and no fun.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJames Franco Michelle Williams and Co. get the Broadway bugApril 16 2014Gossip Girls Leighton Meester OCs Adam Brody dating...February 6 2013Movie Review Monte CarloJuly 1 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesFilmEntertainmentRoommateCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-roommate-20110205,0,3499973.story",200,theroommate11,theroommate,latimes

You know the rest. TWITTER The horror film which also features aTwilightasa Cam Gigandet is directed by Christian E. Christiansen without any distinctive style. The sort of tepid seemingly made-for-television thriller that will appeal only to younger audiences to whom Single White Female might as well have been made in black-and-white The Roommate is an all-too-familiar tale of a young woman increasingly terrorized by her psycho roomie. Managing nary a single original idea throughout its 93-minute running time the film does benefit from a cast of sexy young TV stars who should attract the desired female teen demographic. Freshman small-town girl Sara (Minka Kelly Friday Night Lights) has just settled in at her Southern California university when she encounters friendly roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester Gossip Girl). It isnt long before Rebecca reveals an overprotective side that is violently manifested in a Psycho-like shower attack on Saras freewheeling friend Tracy (Aly Michalka Hellcats). In between classes in fashion design taught by a smarmy professor (Billy Zane) who makes such pronouncements as ""the journey starts right here right now"" Sara finds a job at the local coffeehouse and starts dating hunky frat-boy drummer Steven (Cam Gigandet of Twilight and The O.C.). It wont be hard for audiences to see where things are going when Rebecca solemnly tells Sara ""Im here for you."" Soon anyone who threatens to get between her and her object of obsession becomes subject to Rebeccas rage including an adorable kitten that finds itself in a clothes dryer. It isnt until Rebecca gets the name of Saras dead sister tattooed on her body that the apparently clueless Sara finally gets it. It all leads to the inevitable violent showdown that will seem like deja vu to anyone whos ever watched a late-night cable thriller. Although Meester manages a few creepily intense moments in her Jennifer Jason Leigh-inspired role the rest of the cast get by mainly on their looks with Kelly projecting adorableness at every turn and Gigandet crinkling his eyes in suitably smoldering fashion. Directed in utterly anonymous style by Christian E. Christiansen (an Oscar nominee for his 2007 short At Night) Roommate features the sort of discreet sex and violence guaranteed to procure the desired teen-friendly PG-13 rating.

Though easy on the eyes TV stars Leighton Meester (""Gossip Girl"") and Minka Kelly (""Friday Night Lights"") cant help ""The Roommate"" extend its short lease on the viewers imagination. Formulaic and forgettable this would-be thriller about a mentally ill college student whos violently obsessed with her dorm-room buddy (Kelly) is notable mainly for pushing the PG-13 rating to include phone sex spiked punch animal cruelty and Sapphic smooching. Feebly helmed by Danish director Christian E. Christiansen (""Zoomers"") the low-rent pic might occupy auds for a weekend but wont evict ""Single White Female"" from its top-floor residence among psycho-roomie cinema. Arriving at the fictional U. of Los Angeles from Des Moines cute Sara (Kelly) an aspiring fashion designer gets dragged to a frat party where she flirts with house-band drummer Stephen (Cam Gigandet) and accidentally drinks too much. Stumbling into her ludicrously mod dorm she meets rich-kid roommate Rebecca (Meester) and the two become fast friends despite the latters lack of social skills. Early signs that the roommate a compulsive sketch artist may not be all right upstairs include her humorless insistence on not being called Becky and her hasty borrowing of a necklace that belonged to Saras dearly departed sister. First to notice Rebeccas creepily clingy demeanor is party girl Tracy (Aly Michalka) who learns she cant be Saras friend without getting stalked in the shower. Turns out anyone close to Sara -- including her ex-beau Jason (Matt Lanter) her fashion-plate pal Irene (Danneel Harris) and her scruffy kitten Cuddles -- stands at risk of serious psychic or bodily harm. By the time Rebecca brings Sara to her parents Pasadena mansion for Thanksgiving with Mom and Dad (Frances Fisher and Tomas Arana) wondering whether their daughter has been taking her meds its clear Cuddles wont be the only one in a catfight. As the violence predictably escalates encouraging hunky Stephen to use his arms for something other than drumming ""The Roommate"" vacates the realm of plausibility altogether. The attractive actors including Billy Zane as Saras sleazy beret-sporting prof do what little they can to maintain interest but the screenplay by exec producer Sonny Mallhi contains not a single surprise while d.p. Phil Parmets images are so underlit and dingy that one has to squint to see whats going on. Top to bottom the pics tech package is dismal with only a couple of moody pop songs to distinguish it.

Parked at a diner booth after a night of partying Minka Kelly a freshman at the University Of Los Angeles--one of the most prestigious fake schools in the state--orders a stack. Her new roommate Leighton Meester decides on the fly that she would also like pancakes. From that alarming development its really just a short leap into shooting Kellys friends thousand-yard death stares and tormenting an adorable stray kitty named Cuddles. Meester is a straight-up psycho in The Roommate a deplorable unofficial reworking of Single White Female and the film isnt interested in understanding why or revealing the depths of her psychosis. Its a lazy bloodless pointless boring piece of work lacking even the conviction to deliver a little cheap exploitation. The message of The Roommate seems to be this Avoid the goons outside the Greek system. When Kelly first arrives at ULA shes eager to party at frat houses with her fun-loving hard-drinking new friend Aly Michalka and she finds a super-bland suitor in Cam Gigandet the drummer for a band that doesnt play much beyond house parties. By contrast Meester is a brooding artist type whos immediately tagged as a weirdo for digging abstract contemporary art. Though Kelly doesnt notice the warning signs Meester scares off Kellys friends with creepy obsessive behavior warding off anyone who tries to come between her and her new best friend. By the time Kelly picks up on Meesters intensity it may be too late for Cuddles. It should be said that Single White Female a Hitchcockian thriller by way of Roman Polanskis Rosemarys Baby isnt a particularly great film but at least it follows the psychosexual dynamic between a woman and her copycat friend as far as it can go. Perhaps the PG-13 requirement was a hindrance from the start but The Roommate doesnt bother suggesting the neediness or desire that leads Meester to attach herself to Kelly or start taking on some of her traits. Shes simply a misfit off her meds which in the films view makes her subhuman. She might as well be stalking campus in a hockey mask.
