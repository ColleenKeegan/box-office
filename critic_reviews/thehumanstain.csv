Race self-invention the public vs. the private political correctness run amok late-in-life love these are just a few of the themes.Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a classics professor fired from his job for innocently using the racially offensive word ""spooks"" in class. Silks rise and fall would not be out of place in a Greek tragedy though his story is quintessentially American. Hes a man who has lived with a great secret (which I am about to give away so be warned). Hes a black man whos chosen to ""pass"" as a Jew rejecting the ""we"" of racial identity for the ""I"" of personal fulfillment. It proves a fateful choice for both good and ill. In the course of this tale he will lose his job his wife and his family. Hell also at 71 undergo a late Viagra-assisted flowering of love with a battle-scarred 34-year-old (Nicole Kidman) whose own journey is almost as bizarre as his own.Roths novel doesnt naturally lend itself to movie form. Bentons film is ungainly and overstuffed--not to mention miscast. Though the brooding charismatic Hopkins mesmerizes hes not convincingly American or racially ambiguous and he doesnt mesh with Wentworth Miller who plays Silk as a young man. Kidman again demonstrates her versatility and gutsiness but her beauty is a distraction. I felt I was watching a movie star slumming. Still for all its shortcomings ""The Human Stain"" is an honorable sometimes moving attempt better at evoking the poignancy of Silks autumnal affair than exploring the moral ambiguities of his deception. No surprise there love and lust tend to be more movie-friendly subjects than meditations on the divided American soul.

"The Human Stain Roth on film. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Human Stain Roth on film. The Human Stain Roth on film. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 31 2003 619 PM All Too Human The perils of filming Philip Roth. By David Edelstein Stain on Roths narrative Philip Roths later novels are practically the antithesis of mainstream American cinema The narrator doesnt seem to be telling a story so much as teasing one out of his own labyrinthine musings--churning thought before our eyes into narrative. Its difficult to imagine a perfect compromise between the authors voice and the language of the average studio film but in The Human Stain (Miramax) director Robert Benton and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer have found what seems to me to be the exact midway point between the two--and thereby shown what an unsatisfying place that is to be. This is not to say that their work is dishonorable or that the film is difficult to sit through TheHuman Stain is a much more vital movie than Id been led to expect from its chilly reception at the Toronto Film Festival in September. From its first scene--in which a car driven by Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) creeps along a snow-covered road with a sleeping Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) beside him then swerves into a frozen lake when a pickup truck unaccountably moves into its path--the action carries a powerful sense of loss. But the story barely makes thematic sense in Roths great but convoluted original. When laid out on screen in Bentons stately classical voice its meanings are fatally elusive. Advertisement The Human Stain is the last of an informal trilogy--American Pastoral and I Married aCommunist are its siblings--with the aim of illuminating schisms in the national psyche through individual portraits of grief. The novel opens with a sardonic reference to President Clintons impeachment trial for lying about consensual sexual contact with Monica Lewinsky--and while this seems like a slender rod on which to hang a tragedy it turns out to be rich with resonances. Roth--whod been a target of tabloid ridicule after his break-up with actress Claire Bloom and hospitalization for depression and Halcion addiction--is using Clintons ""stain"" to explore the chasm between private and public morality. It is to be sure a winding thread that leads from Bubba to Roths protagonist Silk a 70ish classics professor and dean of a small New England college who is driven from office when he refers to a couple of absent students--who have never shown up for his class--as ""spooks"" and then learns that he has inadvertently uttered a racist epithet. But what seems at first like an anti-PC screed becomes denser and more elliptical when the narrator (Roths frequent alter ego Nathan Zuckerman) learns that Silk was not a Jew but a very light-skinned black man whod successfully passed for white. (Roth was inspired by the life--and the posthumous exposure as African-American--of Anatole Broyard.) The movie like the novel is a tortured weave After the death of Silks wife who has a heart attack in the course of rallying her husbands defense the ex-dean embarks on a tumultuous affair with a bitter and haunted custodial worker--a young woman whose baggage includes a violent ex-husband a Vietnam vet who has never forgiven her for the deaths of the couples children. If all these threads--along with the tangential story of Zuckerman driven to this quiet corner of New England after his latest divorce--seem oddly juxtaposed well they are. But as Zuckerman ruminates on the events of the novel they somehow coalesce into a singular portrait of collective repression of a culture thats forever on the brink of insanity. The movie coalesces into nothing Its one of those films that makes you say ""That was powerful. Now what the hell was it about?"" The problems begin with Zuckerman who is roughly Silks contemporary and understands too well the forces he was up against in the 40s and 50s as he tried to find a place in white society. But Benton has unaccountably cast the 40ish Gary Sinise who is little more than a pallid Horatio to Silks raging Hamlet. Its hard to think of more egregious miscasting than Anthony Hopkins as a closet black man and Nicole Kidman as a surly custodial worker. I was expecting the worst from Hopkins--he has lately been coasting on pure ham. But Im bound to say hes excellent. Its a beautifully modulated performance reined-in but simmering his flab looking for all the world like clenched musculature. He seems physically different here too his neck thicker his head more egglike. Is he a plausible Coleman Silk? Not quite but if I didnt make the leap into belief I wasnt constantly nagged by disbelief either. Kidman on the other hand is far too model-poised for Faunia and her prole accent doesnt help. (Shes supposed to be a former rich girl who ran away from an incestuous stepfather but that gum-cracking demeanor is a neon sign for working class.) I giggled when I saw her milking cows with a few of those exquisite auburn ringlets in her face--but from moment to moment I liked watching her. And Benton does good work with the others. A tall deep-voiced young actor named Wentworth Miller (hes actually biracial) is superb as the young Silk tentatively trying to craft a persona that will allow him to function in both black and white worlds. As the blond girl of Silks integrationist fantasies Jacinda Barrett has a stunning scene in which she learns of his true heritage on the doorstep of his home and holds a frozen smile for hours. The problem isnt so much whats on the screen but whats off it--the sometimes vexing but always probing voice of the author a man whose delusional projections tell us more about the national psyche than almost any author alive. Bentons inescapably sane adaptation is proof that lucidity can sometimes be the greatest obfuscation. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) a professor troubled by a lifelong secret sits on the porch with his friend Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) taking in the night air. From the radio comes the sweet reedy voice of Fred Astaire singing ""Cheek to Cheek"" and Hopkins face softens. When you hear music like that he says quietly ""everything unclenches and you are filled with a wish not to die."" Unable to contain the pleasure the music gives him he grabs Zuckerman and the two lurch across the porch in a giddy dance swinging each other around and swooping their arms toward the sky; theyre like Oscar and Felix doing Fred and Ginger and theyre as happy in that moment as any two people can be. ""The Human Stain"" is about an aging man looking back on his life and on a choice made as a young man that changed its course irrevocably. (Though many published articles about ""The Human Stain"" will reveal this choice -- and of course it will be known to the many who have read the 1998 Philip Roth novel on which the film is based -- Id prefer not to do so here; the movies nearly half over by the time the secret is unveiled and the experience is changed if youre waiting for it.) Movie review  ""The Human Stain"" with Anthony Hopkins Nicole Kidman Ed Harris Gary Sinise Wentworth Miller Jacinda Barrett. Directed by Robert Benton from a screenplay by Nicholas Meyer based on the novel by Philip Roth. 110 minutes. Rated R for language and sexuality/nudity. Metro Meridian. Coleman has experienced much upheaval in recent years Hes a former professor who has lost his job just before retirement after being accused of uttering a racial slur and a recent widower now scandalizing his college town by his affair with a troubled working-class woman (Nicole Kidman) whos half his age and has secrets of her own. The Roth novel sprawling and reflective and full of detailed character notes would seem a difficult one to bring to the screen and Benton and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer have greatly simplified it keeping its essence but reducing secondary characters and sharpening the focus. Its essentially become a love story set against a backdrop of race and class. Both Coleman and his lover Faunia are fleeing their pasts hiding together in her spartan bed reducing the world to the tangle of their bodies. SURVEY ""The Human Stain"" Seen it? Rate it. View Results Benton a marvelous director of actors (see Paul Newman in ""Nobodys Fool"" Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"") helps these two familiar faces reveal new shades of emotion. Hopkins so rarely a romantic lead is unexpectedly gentle like a tiger perfectly tamed. Kidman constantly smoking cigarettes clutched in her elegantly spidery fingers speaks in a tormented effortful whisper her voice lumbering like an old engine. Among the fine supporting cast Anna Deavere Smith is a standout; she has a heartbreaking late scene in which you see something die inside her. ""The Human Stain"" despite the delicacy of its performances occasionally feels heavy-handed; the subject matter has an enormous weight and the movie sometimes staggers under it. (Kidman has a late monologue with a caged bird thats beautifully delivered but painfully obvious in its metaphors.) But there are moments like that porch-lit dance that find both truth and lyricism touching on what it means to be alive and on what we owe to the ghosts of the past.

Starring Anthony Hopkins Nicole Kidman Gary Sinise and Ed Harris. Directed by Robert Benton. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Human Stain"" is a mediocre movie made by and for intelligent people. That doesnt mean that in the end its any better than a routine Vin Diesel picture but theres an overall sense of worthiness about it thats not unearned. Good actors (Anthony Hopkins Nicole Kidman) and a good director (Robert Benton) do their best to put over a good book by a major American novelist (Philip Roth). Unfortunately just as exalted individuals can be done in by the most pedestrian of ailments ""The Human Stain"" falls victim to a fatal lack of narrative drive suspense and drama. Kidman and Hopkins are wrong for their roles and that combined with a pervading inevitability cuts the film off from any sustained vitality. The result is something admirable but lifeless. Still theres pleasure to be had in watching the actors make the effort even if theres no mistaking that were watching an effort -- and no mistaking that were being offered effort not truth with the implicit idea that we should admire it. When the patrician-looking Kidman playing a cleaning lady rages about her white-trash life of tragedy and degradation theres no believing her not for a second. But theres no reason not to watch either. Check it out Kidman with a tattoo yelling. In the same spirit we watch Anthony Hopkins play an African American passing as Jewish even though he looks neither black nor Jewish and doesnt even bother to sound American. ""He taught in England"" were told. That a black man from Newark N.J. pretending to be a white man from Newark would adopt an English accent adds a whole layer of artifice that Roth never anticipated. One could argue that it takes the character of Coleman Silk and renders him finally and completely crazy but thats not how we experience it. Instead we experience ""The Human Stain"" as a movie about Hopkins and Kidman kissing. Its 1998 the year that Bill Clinton was impeached for making a fool of himself and Silk an ostensibly Jewish professor of classics is in trouble. He has made an innocent statement that was deliberately misconstrued as racist and in reaction he quits. His wife dies and he soon befriends the writer Nathan Zuckerman Roths alter ego played by Gary Sinise. Zuckerman is the witness to the story the narrator. ""The Human Stain"" is a difficult book to adapt full of digressions and leaps back and forth in time. But the main difficulty is that the plot elements are essentially disparate in that one doesnt proceed from the other in dramatic terms. The connections between Colemans past and his present his race and his career his sex life and the presidents are all thematic not dramatic. In a book this isnt a problem -- it could be a virtue -- but in a movie we feel the lack of build as a lack of urgency. Benton (""Kramer vs. Kramer"") and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer could have chosen to surrender completely to the book by making their film into a rumination on character. But that could have been worse. Instead Meyer slashes through the books first 100 pages in a matter of minutes to get to its narrative heart -- Silks revitalizing but perilous relationship with the young cleaning woman. Even with that theres not much on which to hang a compelling dramatic story. The professors young lover does have a violent insane ex-husband but his scariness is undercut by the casting of Ed Harris whos more roguish than threatening. But compounding the problem more than anything else is the esteem in which the book is held which prevents the filmmakers from wholesale additions to the story. Theyd have had more freedom with a so-so book and might have made a better movie. As it stands the best scenes are the flashbacks to the 40s with Wentworth Miller quite believable as the young Coleman who gradually decides to turn his back on everything he is in order to become what hes not. The pain of that process is real and seems more important than an old mans last Viagra-propelled romp through Cupids grove. Advisory This film contains strong language sexual situations and frontal nudity.

Nicole Kidman is miscast as a down-on-her-luck cleaning woman in the film adaptation of Philip Roths The Human Stain. Miramax One can start with the sluggish direction the misguided casting the tedious screenplay and the self-important story. Perhaps the biggest blunder was in casting Nicole Kidman as an illiterate down-on-her-luck cleaning lady with a tough demeanor. That mistake is followed closely by the decision to put Anthony Hopkins in the lead role of a New Jersey-born professor whose secret identity makes his casting all the more wrong-headed. (Maybe if he had managed to drop his British accent we could suspend our disbelief.) Philip Roths novel of the same name is filled with pretentious passages such as a long ode to the restorative powers of Viagra. ("" Im taking Viagra the academic professes. Theres La Belle Dame sans Merci ... Thanks to Viagra Ive come to understand Zeus amorous transformation. Thats what they should have called Viagra. They should have called it Zeus. "") Screenwriter Nicholas Meyer adapted Roths book and changed or exaggerated plot points to make the story even less believable. Robert Bentons (Nobodys Fool) direction is uncommonly flat and dull. Some scenes such as a key one in which Hopkins and Kidman drive along a snowy road feel interminable. More about the movie The Human Stain (1/2 stars) Stars Anthony Hopkins NIcole Kidman Gary Sinise Ed Harris Director Robert Benton Distributor Miramax Rating R for languageand sexuality/nudity Select cities The story centers on Coleman Silk (Hopkins) a respected dean at a small New England college. His illustrious career is destroyed when he makes a classroom comment misinterpreted as racist. Amid a firestorm he resigns. His wife (Phyllis Newman) dies on the day that he quits his job and Coleman blames the school and its intransigence for her death. (In the book she did not die so suddenly or dramatically.) He approaches a reclusive acquaintance novelist Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) and pours out his story save for the most interesting part his big secret. One of the secrets Coleman does reveal is the affair hes having with Faunia Farely a much younger woman (Kidman). The way in which Faunia seduces this disgraced elderly gent -- inviting him in when he gives her a lift then going directly upstairs and waiting for him on her bed buck-naked -- is a bit far-fetched but no doubt the stuff of male fantasies. But then so is her even having this white-hot affair with the sad old guy. The gratuitous references to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal that worked as sociopolitical context in the book come off like tired non sequiturs in the film. And speaking of gratuitous there are not one but two nude dancing scenes (and one fully clothed cringer with Hopkins and Sinise high-stepping it). The more artful dance features a rather graceful Kidman; the other is an odd combination of lascivious and plodding with Jacinda Barrett attempting an awkward striptease with plenty of frontal nudity. But the weirdest scene is one in which the unpleasant Faunia shows her soft side sharing an emotional moment with a caged crow. Somehow she feels a connection to this blank-eyed bird and is moved to tears when speaking to it. Something must have been lost in translation. Its problematic enough that the movies lead characters are unlikable. But worse is the blackening of The Human Stain with a trite and forced plot uninteresting digressions and clunky direction.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Sign Up > Facebook Twitter Follow laweekly Other Scott Foundas Lost in Translation Thursday October 30 2003 at 12 a.m. By Scott Foundas Philip Roths 2000 novel The Human Stain was an untidy overstuffed thing to begin with a mad scramble to cram his every thought about Bill Clintons America (and a host of related isms -- racism sexism ageism classism) into 300-odd pages. Its the story not just of Coleman Silk the classics professor (played by Anthony Hopkins in this film adaptation) who impetuously asks the question ""Do these people exist or are they spooks?"" with regard to two absentee students who it turns out just happen to be black -- with predictably disastrous consequences for their teacher. Its also about the apparently exploitative affair Silk enters into with one Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) a member of the college custodial staff less than half his age with a deranged Vietnam veteran of a jealous husband (Ed Harris). And about Silks developing friendship with his neighbor the novelist and narrator and long-standing Roth alter ego Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise). And thats just the first 100 pages. So its not exactly surprising that in condensing the lions share of Roths manifold subplots and multiple antagonists into a cinematic frame of less than two hours the movie (directed by Robert Benton from a screenplay by Nicholas Meyer) develops a restless shifty rhythm wherein too often only the storys most incendiary polemical aspects -- the ones where you feel like Roth is chastising you from some post-liberal Jewish-intellectual Parnassus -- come bubbling up to the surface. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Yet there are saving graces. Though The Human Stain is in large part brazenly miscast -- Kidman as white trash Sinise as a rather too young and healthy-looking recent prostate-cancer survivor Hopkins for reasons that must not be disclosed here -- Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer Nobodys Fool) is so good at playing to his actors strengths that he nearly makes it all work. There is also the exquisite cinematography of the late Jean-Yves Escoffier (this was his last film) whose camera prowls around the corners of porches and bedrooms like a curious kitten and whose lighting basks haunted interiors in deceptively inviting autumnal New England hues. But as both book and film The Human Stain comes to vividest life in its extended flashbacks which offer the most compelling exploration of Roths perennial themes of self-loathing and -reinvention. In the film this is thanks particularly to young television actor Wentworth Miller new this year to the movies (here and in the recently released Underworld) but whose name may one day shine as brightly as those now billed above it. As the young Coleman Silk -- whether duking it out in an amateur boxing match or seducing his first real girlfriend in his first real apartment -- Miller has a voice like polished oak and pantherlike movements that exude a sleek self-confidence. But he is likewise beset by that deep-set self-doubting neurosis that so many Rothian protagonists carry with them. And it makes for an intriguing inner conflict; watching him neither the camera nor we in the audience can break his distant yet hypnotizing gaze.

Lennix Mimi Kuzyk Margo Martindale Wentworth Miller Anna Deavere Smith Kerry Washington; Director Robert Benton; Author Nicholas Meyer; Release Date Wide 10/31/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 106; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Miramax Posted October 29 2003 -- 1200 AM EST Anthony Hopkins has played Hitler Picasso Othello Nixon John Quincy Adams and Yitzhak Rabin. His leading-man qualities are broadcast in his cinder-block head wine-cask chest iceberg eyes and suggestion of brute force held in reserve while he delivers clipped or murmured dialogue flecked with a Welsh accent. Hes a great pillar of a star. Nicole Kidman has played a French courtesan Russian immigrant Depression-era gangsters moll Henry James heroine ghost and Virginia Woolf. Her leading-lady qualities are represented in her seaweed-wild hair satin-ribbon arms articulated back and ability to extend or retract the force field of her beauty (and her Australian speech patterns) in service to a director she believes in. Shes a great sylph of a star. The two are splendid protean specimens - who are exactly the wrong size for The Human Stain which arrives garlanded with prestige like holiday pine-bough swags on Martha Stewarts staircase. For starters the sprawling novel is honors-project-daunting to adapt. The third in Philip Roths trilogy of late-period masterworks the book tells the story of Coleman Silk (played on screen by Hopkins) an esteemed college dean who in his autumnal years is shocked into stocktaking honesty by two cataclysmic events. The first is a false accusation of racism the damage from which (during the high-dudgeon years of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal) extends to the destruction of Silks career and the death of his wife from a brain aneurysm. The second is the surprise gift of erotic passion and finally love the old man receives from Faunia Farley (Kidman) a young local woman whose blue-collar existence - she mucks barns cleans campus bathrooms works in the town post office - obscures the more complicated hardships of her life in proximity to her violent ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris). Characteristically the narrative is filtered through the perspective of Roths fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman (here so stripped of any ethnic identification that hes played by Gary Sinise) a famous writer with his own disconnected emotional wiring whom Silk initially enlists to write an account of his wounds in academe. In Roths novel past and present jostle with the kind of virtuoso tension only the written word can sustain and by the time the secret that Silk has guarded about himself all his life slips out theres a moment of real jolt to the revelation. But in the movie directed by Robert Benton (""Nobodys Fool"") from a speech-strung script by Nicholas Meyer (""Fatal Attraction"") and embellished by Rachel Portmans score with the kind of well-bred musing arpeggios that always portend serious drama in a cold climate Silks identity bombshell never explodes The truth is a fancy and arbitrary twist - a color detail - in this overbred literary adaptation. It arrives somewhat early in the plot too which is why there is no viewing pleasure squandered in discussing it here. Coleman Silk a man who has ""passed"" as white - and as one of the few Jewish professors on campus - is in fact a light-skinned African American who decided as a teenage amateur boxer in the 1940s to deny his racial identity for what he saw as a life of greater opportunities through self-invention. Played in his youth with exciting believability by newcomer Wentworth Miller young Silk is forceful in the pain of his psychic discomfort especially when he brings home an unsuspecting white girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett) to meet his imposing mother (a striking turn by Anna Deavere Smith). So how does this simmering young man from the streets of East Orange N.J. wrestle with homegrown demons to become...Anthony Hopkins Commonwealth accent flying proudly a taurine presence more likely to pass for covert cannibal than racial changeling? He doesnt; Hopkins cant pass for Silk. (Voice-over narration suggests that a graduate stint at Oxford turned him Welsh.) And how for that matter does an emotionally battered rural cleaning lady retain such elegance of gesture even when milking cows? Not believably. (In a speech that might explain the actress participation Faunia describes an unhappy upper-class childhood rejected in favor of chain-smoked cigs and drab cardigans.) ""The Human Stain"" is contradictorily drained of color by the spotlight turned on its charismatic leads. Between the labors of simplifying the story for the screen and accommodating the stardust of world-class actors an essentially uniquely American tragic hero and heroine are bleached of real American tragedy. In the end indeed its Harris crazed Vietnam-scarred Lester alternately raging and chillingly disconnected from the spreading ruin in which he has had a hand who leaves a mark. Believable condemnable pitiable and (as played by the vital actor) vulnerable he alone is the kind of ordinary-size stained human I think Roth had in mind in every sentence.

Story of a man who has lived a lie all his life and seeks one last chance of happiness with a woman half his age seems destined for solid box office but much will depend on reaction to films more questionable elements especially to casting of Hopkins. Destined to provoke controversy ""The Human Stain"" is an intelligent adaptation of Philip Roths arguably unfilmable novel. Powered by two eye-catching performances this story of a man who has lived a lie all his adult life and who seeks one last chance of happiness with a woman half his age seems destined for solid box office with hefty ancillary a given. But much will depend on critical reaction to the films more questionable elements and especially to the casting of Anthony Hopkins. Filmmakers must have been aware from the outset of the projects difficulties the main problem being to capture the essence of the highly regarded book without making what was powerful on the printed page look ridiculous on the screen. Director Robert Benton and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer have pretty much achieved this despite a tendency to overstatement in Meyers adaptation. But the bottom line -- and its one which will provoke the most lively debate -- is that Hopkins is playing an African-American a prospect that seems at first glance so utterly preposterous as to be dismissed out of hand. Indeed not since Mel Ferrer made his screen debut in 1949 playing a basically similar role in ""Lost Boundaries"" and Jeanne Crain also passed for white in ""Pinky"" the same year has such a seemingly wayward example of casting taken place. And yet if the book was to be filmed at all some difficult choices had to be made and finding a well-known actor from either side of the racial spectrum who could convince in such a role was bound to be problematic. Indeed the third part of Roths trilogy of novels about post-war America (the others are the Pulitzer Prize winning ""American Pastoral"" and ""I Married a Communist"") might equally well have been titled ""I Passed for White"" (the title of a 1960 pic on the same subject). The story of a distinguished university professor who loses his job and indirectly his wife after he is accused of uttering a racial slur is given intense irony by the fact that all his life he has hidden the fact he is a light-skinned black. That more than the Spring-December love affair is the core of Roths novel and of Bentons film. On a snowy isolated country road a car carrying Coleman Silk (Hopkins) and his young mistress Faunia Farely (Nicole Kidman) crashes into an icy lake in attempting to avoid a pick-up truck. A narration spoken by Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) a writer and friend of Silk takes up the story which begins in the summer of 1998 when the scandal enveloping President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was occupying the minds of Americans. That summer Silk a much-admired classics teacher in commenting on two members of his class who have not attended any of his lectures asks rhetorically ""Do they exist or are they spooks?"" They are he discovers African-Americans and theyre deeply offended by what is perceived as a racial slur. Vainly defending himself before an unsympathetic and politically correct faculty board meeting Silk resigns. The news literally kills his wife Iris (Phyllis Newman). Six months later Silk approaches the reclusive Zuckerman and attempts to persuade him to write a novel about this piece of injustice. The two become friends andduring one of their get-togethers Silk reveals hes having a Viagra-propelled affair with a woman half his age -- Farely (Kidman) a sensual outspoken beauty who as Silks attorney later describes her is not in his league and not of his world. At the first meeting between Farely and Silk she seduces the bewildered but grateful academic. Before long a passionate affair envelops them overshadowed by the menacing presence of Faunias ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris) a Vietnam vet with a lethal temper who blames Faunia for the deaths of their children in an accident. Meanwhile Silk recalls his youth (he is played as a young man by Wentworth Miller) and his affair with the lovely Steena Paulsson (Jacinda Barrett). After the sudden death of his father (Harry Lennix) in 1944 he rebels against going to a black college and instead enlists in the Navy as a white man. After the war when he takes Steena to meet his mother (Anna Deavere Smith) the girl is so shocked she breaks off their affair. When Silk meets Iris (Mili Avital) the girl he marries he simply denies the existence of his family. The revelation that Silk is not a Jew but an African-American passing for white comes about one hour into the film but theres no way to withhold this twist from potential audiences as its such a crucial and combustible ingredient. A key problem Benton is unable to avoid is that Hopkins and Miller dont look (or talk) the least bit like one another. Miller who gives a strong muted performance convinces as a light-skinned African-American in a way Hopkins never does which is not to suggest that the Welsh-born actor doesnt give another intelligent powerful portrayal. Its just that the believability gap looms large. Playing a rather slutty working-class woman whos seen it all Kidman once again extends her range. Shes saddled with a couple of scenes that dont ring true (one of which has her talking to a caged crow) but thats the fault of the screenplay not the thesp whose sensuality and passion are raw. Yet another Aussie import Barrett brings cool beauty and potent sensuality to the pivotal role of Steena. Theres strong support from a fine supporting cast notably Sinise Harris and Smith. Pic is dedicated to the late Jean-Yves Escoffier whose textured Scope photography eloquently captures the various moods and periods of this complex drama. Indeed all craft contributions are of the highest order.
