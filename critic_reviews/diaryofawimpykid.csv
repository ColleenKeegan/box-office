STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 25 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 24 2011 314PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The responsible film guardian will feel anxious early on in the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid instalment as the title milksop is humiliated a dozen or so times in the opening sequence a family trip to a roller-skating rink. First middle-school student Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is forced to recall a scalding public embarrassment - peers shrieking at his eye-patch-sized swimsuit at a pool. Then hes cowering in a washroom stall bound in toilet paper. After that hes tricked into eating pizza someone sat on. Next comes a bungled attempt at dancing with a cool towering blonde. Finally the 12-year-old gets the old vaudeville kiss-off - a pastry in the kisser. He slips and falls in someones birthday cake. And so questions begin to form in the responsible film guardians mind Do I really want the little guy beside me here contemplating endless variations of public shame? Can this really be good for us? Pretty soon though Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules a sequel to the 2010 hit based on Jeff Kinneys Wimpy Kid book series begins pointing the finger of scorn at Gregs responsible excruciatingly prudent caregivers Gregs mother it turns out is an overbearing liberal a newspaper columnist who strongly believes in Big Family handouts. Susan Heffley (Rachael Harris) even carries ""mom dollars"" that are dispensed to her kids whenever Greg and older brother Rodrick appear to be getting along. These vouchers can later be exchanged for real money. Dad would prefer to be paid in silent neglect. Frank Heffley (Steve Zahn) just wants to be left alone to play with his Civil War armies in the basement. (""Theyre not toys theyre figurines"") Gregs primary tormentor Rodrick (Torontos Devon Bostick) is also seen in a satirical light. Hes no better than Greg with girls. Big brother is also dyslexic. The name of the 16-year-olds band is Loded Diper. Once it becomes clear that the new Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an equal-opportunity offender and that it is the politically correct modern family that is being picked on rather than young Greg the film becomes cheerfully mischievous fun for everyone. One giddy scene here has Gregs best friend the hopelessly honest Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron) coming over for a sleepover. Rowleys dad hands the boy over with a DVD of the good-for-young-minds kid show Soft Bears. Aaaah. The boys go upstairs to Gregs room. Soon mom shows up with a plate of good-for-young-bodies broccoli spears. Mmm-mmm. And when the door slams shut with mom safely gone Greg whips out a horror movie featuring a big-bosomed starlet - that and a Santas-bag-sized haul of salty snacks. The plot to Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules is a see-sawing feud between Greg and Rodrick that is resolved at their hometowns annual talent show. But all of that including a big production number finale is simply an excuse for all the Heffleys to get on and off each others nerves. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series might more aptly be titled Diary of a Wimpy Family.. The film sequel is more engaging than the original was because it spends more time at home. That makes sense. A kid dealing with a mad mom offers more comic and dramatic potential than the same child tiptoeing around a deranged gym teacher.

Movie Information Diary of a Wimpy KidRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Thor FreudenthalActors Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Rachael Harris Steve Zahn Devon Bostick Grayson Russell Karan Brar and Chloe MoretzRun time 120 minutesMPAA rating PG (some rude humor and language)Synopsis Jeff Kinneys stick figure becomes a real boy in this live-action adaptation of his book series.More movies from GuideLive.comInstead Greg Heffleys triumphs are subtler and more satisfyingly real as he negotiates the tricky move from elementary to middle school where he and his best friend Rowley have yet to go through the growth spurts that seem to be exploding around them with intimidating frequency. Sure in Gregs anxiety to be popular (and get a seat at a lunchroom table instead of being relegated to the cafeteria floor) he makes a mess out of almost everything he tries - from wrestling to safety patrol to the school play.But while bossy Patty Ferrell may still beat him up and declare him a social outcast he ultimately figures out that it only matters if he cares what Patty and her followers think. If you do right by your true friends and keep them close you dont need to stress about the opinions of people you dont care about anyway.Kind of a cool message that should appeal to the fans of Jeff Kinneys popular book series.Its always tricky adapting best-sellers to the screen. Not only are you tampering with the images readers have in their minds but in the case of Wimpy Kid the challenge is amped up by having to adapt Kinneys winsome stick-figure drawings to live-action people.Fortunately the casting is picture-perfect with 12-year-old Zachary Gordon as Greg and 11-year-old Robert Capron as Rowley. Zachary is at once small and vulnerable but unabashedly embraces Gregs bratty side while Robert summons up Rowleys sweetness. After all Greg does do wrong by Rowley a lot through the story - showing his friend hes embarrassed by him trying to get him to change what he wears and how he talks and even at one point allowing Rowley to unwittingly take the fall for something Greg has secretly done.But under Thor Freudenthals kid-savvy direction you dont hate Zacharys Greg because all these moments flow organically out of his insecurities. Zachary portrays Greg as a kid struggling to figure things out as he goes along and you cant stop rooting for him to get it right.Fans may miss favorite bits such as the one where Greg pretends his classmate Chirag (the very funny Karan Brar) is not actually there. Others may wonder whether we really needed a potential (though happily unrealized - this is middle school after all) love interest in the form of Angie (Chloe Moretz). But the ""invisible"" Chirag bit is admittedly off-topic and Angie does provide a Jiminy Cricket-like voice that points Greg in the direction he needs to go.Bottom line we get a fully realized family for Greg including sneering big brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) complete with his Loded Diaper van for his raucous band potty-challenged little brother Manny (alternately Connor and Owen Fielding) along with a satisfying scene about a slimy slice of cheese that has been festering forever on the playground and gives anyone who makes contact with it the ""cheese touch"" rendering that person an instant pariah.No more giveaways but we will say the cheese is good food for thought if not for eating. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Friendship conquers all in Grade 6 | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDiary of a Wimpy Kid Friendship conquers all in Grade 6The complex society of the sixth grader - where to sit what not to wear and above all dont touch the cheese - yields kid-friendly comedy in Diary of a Wimpy Kid .Rowley (Robert Capron) right entertains his pals Greg (Zachary Gordon) centre and Chirag (Karan Brar).  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. March 19 2010 Starring Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Devon Bostick and Steve Zahn. Directed by Thor Freudenthal. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PG The complex society of the sixth grader - where to sit what not to wear and above all dont touch the cheese - yields kid-friendly comedy in Diary of a Wimpy Kid.It may also make parents sigh with relief that all they have to navigate these days is the adult jungle.Article Continued Below Some pre-pubescent memories are just too cringe-making to revisit.Thats the charm of Jeff Kinneys bestselling illustrated kids novel series Diary of a Wimpy Kid brought to the screen by Thor Freudenthal a director who earns a shot at redemption here after the arfer Hotel for Dogs.Wimpy Kid has the same kind of kids-eye-view approach that made TVs The Wonder Years click - theres a quirky realism tucked amidst the daily humiliations visited upon Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) and his goofily earnest sidekick Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron).This is a boys world plenty of pee jokes B.O. and boogers plus the ongoing threat of a slice of mouldy cheese percolating on the school tarmac that dooms anyone who touches it to ""cheese touch"" outcast status. Girls are only there to beat you up or make you feel unworthy. (Just wait till you hit adolescence guys.)The Wimpy story sticks close to Kinneys books using liberal doses of simple animation to speed things along as conniving Greg schemes to get his mug in the yearbook by being the best at something. Anything will do.Loyal Rowley buys into his buddys social-climbing plan his grinning devotion to Greg blinding him to his own social faux pas - like wearing a serape to class and cheerfully inviting his buddy to ""play"" after school within earshot of cool kids.""You dont say `play you say `hang out"" Greg hisses. The school paper is out despite a personal invitation from the world-weary reporter Angie (500 Days of Summers Chloe Moretz). ""Its the voice of the people making fun of the people"" she tells them.Wrestling brings new embarrassment. So does drama. Maybe herding little kids as part of the schools paramilitary safety patrol is the key to heightened popularity.Evil big brother Rodrick (Torontos Devon Bostick) adds another layer of cruelty submitting Greg to creative torments when hes not jamming with his band Loded Diper (thats loaded diaper). At age 18 Bostick looks too old for the part but hes as cravenly evil as Eddie Haskell and just as entertaining.Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris have graduated to parent roles and have the thankless task of moving the story along without getting much out of it beyond a paycheque. While Zachary Gordon manages to be likeable as the sly self-interested Greg the real standout is Caprons Rowley a kid who is true to himself even if hes the wimpiest kid in school.Scratch that. Theres one who outdoes him - the pale bespectacled redhead Fregley (Grayson Russell) whose great joy in life is offering naming rights on the hair growing out of his giant belly freckle.The friendship message that comes wrapped in the world of Wimpy Kid gives the movie its centre and its heart along with a reminder that there is no greater act of devotion than a kid who will submit himself to the cheese touch for a pal.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

A diminutive youngster tries to survive bullies and social ostracization during his first year of middle school in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" an above-average and sometimes surprising kid movie based on the first of a popular series of cartoon books by Jeff Kinney. The opening scenes at home are no more promising than director Thor Freudenthals ""Hotel for Dogs."" But things improve when the sardonic narrator Greg (Zachary Gordon who resembles a pint-size Paul Rudd) arrives at school where hes immediately labeled a social outcast. Determined to be a big man on campus Greg joins the safety patrol. Not only is this decidedly uncool but our hero discovers that a bigger liability may be his large makeup-loving friend Rowley (Robert Capron). From an adults point of view the most interesting thing about this movie may be its preteen homo-eroticism. Besides a lengthy wrestling sequence theres a positively ""La Cage aux Folles"" moment when Greg tries to butch up Rowley by spray-painting his pink bicycle black and banishing his buds ""I Love Mom"" T-shirt. Greg eventually betrays Rowley altogether but is driven to jealousy when the increasingly popular Rowley begins sleepovers with a positively metrosexual new friend. Unusually accepting of alternative lifestyles for a mainstream Hollywood product the film climaxes with a production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in which a teacher offers a mortified Greg the role of Dorothy because of his lovely soprano. A nasty girl eventually plays Dorothy but ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" doesnt wimp out in suggesting that when it comes to pre-adolescent male bonding boys will be boys in all sorts of ways.

Starring Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Rachael Harris Steve Zahn Devon Bostick Chloe Moretz Director Thor Freudenthal Release Opened Mar 19 2010  Editorial Review He still has a certain drawBy Dan KoisFriday March 19 2010As it turns out most children are not young wizards plucked from obscurity to lead the fight against evil. Nor do they fall down rabbit holes or discover theyre Greek demigods or visit magical chocolate factories. No most kids are just kids and not all that much happens to ordinary kids -- except for school and family and life which can seem as filled with peril as the most fantastic movie adventure. Its this welcome notion that animates ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" the live-action adaptation of the first of Jeff Kinneys bestselling hybrid novel/comics.In Thor Freudenthals intermittently inspired film Greg Heffley -- the 11-year-old known to millions of young readers as a glum-faced stick figure with a cowlick -- may have been transformed into a live boy played by Zachary Gordon but his trials and tribulations remain true to the book. Hes just starting middle school as the second-smallest kid in his class. He has parents who dont understand him a teenage brother who torments him and a best friend who humiliates him. Despite all that he has dreams of fame and fortune -- or at least of securing a spot in the ""Class Favorites"" section of the yearbook.Gregs desire to become known by his classmates -- which he pursues at all costs and to the point of endangering his friendship with dorky Rowley (Robert Capron) -- is the thread that holds together ""Wimpy Kids"" otherwise uneven series of set pieces. Its also the movies most truthful observation about childhood. Like the books ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is honest about the outsize importance that popularity -- or the lack of it -- has for sixth-graders. Gregs desperation to climb the social ladder at his school (illustrated at times with helpful graphics of an actual ladder demonstrating the depths to which Gregs coolness falls) will be grimly recognizable to any current or former middle-schooler.As for the rest of the movie its a scattershot affair too slackly paced to sustain real comic momentum. Some gags such as an extended Halloween sequence that features poor Rowley dressed by his nervous mother in a reflective vest and flashing lights work for both kids and parents; others such as a series of predictable wrestling matches will have Mom and Dad checking their watches and sighing when Greg is pinned again -- this time by a girlGordon and Capron the two young actors at the center of the movie are likable if not particularly vivid. Sharp supporting performances come from Chlo Moretz who in a month will shock audiences everywhere as a foul-mouthed tween superheroine in ""Kick-Ass"" but for now plays a brainy seventh-grader reading ""Howl"" under the bleachers; and Devon Bostick as Gregs smelly brother Rodrick who plays drums for a band called amusingly Lded Diper. (While the movie does indulge in some mild gross-out humor its infatuation with boogers and pee is substantially less than that of any real 11-year-old boy.)In its concern for the particulars of real-life childhood ""Wimpy Kid"" seems less like a movie than an agreeable family sitcom -- like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" but without the crack comic timing. We parents who all think our children are extraordinary might find the world of ""Wimpy Kid"" a bit constrained. But kids who realize theyre fully ordinary -- that is pretty much all of them -- will be pleased to see a world they recognize on the big screen.Kois is a freelance reviewer.

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie review Outcast tale blends in |       NJ.com comments Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie review Outcast tale blends in Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 19 2010 at 420 AM View/Post Comments Rob McEwanGreg (Zachary Gordon third from right) and Rowley (Robert Capron) stand out (or down) from the rest of the singlet-clad wrestling team.Greg Heffley is so small that girls in pigtails routinely beat him up. So unpopular that his one friend is a chunky loser in Birkenstocks. So tortured at home that he spends hours hiding from his older brother. He cant believe his life can get any worse. But then he hasnt started middle school yet. Diary of a Wimpy Kid (PG) Fox (120 min.) Directed by Thor Freudenthal. With Zachary Gordon Robert Capron. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two and a half stars Ratings note The film contains bathroom jokes and comic violence. Gregs travails fuel the ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" books -- and have inspired millions of grade-schoolers uninterested in wizards dragons or vampires to still pick up one of those slim illustrated novels and read. Theyll be happy to see their hero is now a movie star. The uninitiated however will be less impressed. The ""Wimpy"" books -- with their clueless parents weird teachers grotesque sidekicks slightly surreal touches and wry narrator - are fun. But to anyone whos seen even an evening of kids TV over the last decade theyre also awfully familiar. So whats so great about this wimp? Hard to say although director Thor Freudenthal -- who made ""Hotel for Dogs"" almost watchable -- is smart enough to include plenty of the originals stick-figure drawings done here as animation. Lots of its occasional edginess too. Actually the great thing about Greg isnt that hes so great; its that hes so recognizable in his insecurity hunger for popularity and tendency to fold just when he needs to stand up. Hes no role model which is precisely why readers identify with him. Zachary Gordon makes an appealingly unappealing Greg and Robert Capron grows on you as Rowley Jefferson the clueless best friend in too-tight sweater-vests. And the ever-amusing Steve Zahn makes a surprise appearance as Gregs dad. But the film - like all those Nickelodeon shows - is strictly rote. Mom is kind of humorless Dad is an overgrown adolescent schoolwork is to be avoided at all costs and the only smart character in this world of clueless boys is a sarcastic girl. Nor do any of the situations build. A Halloween attack by horrible high schoolers a disastrous school play a mother-son dance -- all have the potential for becoming standout scenes. None do. The movies fine for what it is and it does what its supposed to -- complete with bullies bathroom jokes and boogers. But it still cant quite answer one question Why spend money to go see this? When you could just stay home and watch reruns of ""Neds Declassified"" for free?

ABOUT THE MOVIEDiary of a Wimpy Kid  1/2 (out of four)Stars Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Steve Zahn Devon Bostick Rachael Harris Chloe Grace Moretz Grayson RussellDirector Thor FreudenthalDistributor Fox 2000Rating PG for some rude humor and languageRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theres nothing adorable about middle school. Its an awkward way station between innocent childhood and turbulent teen years. IN DEPTH This Wimpy Kid was made not born Based on the best-selling 2007 novel by Jeff Kinney Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an appealing family movie that humorously chronicles that in-between period from the perspective of a smallish kid named Greg (Zachary Gordon) who longs to achieve status and popularity. Though the movie does indulge in some kid-friendly gross-out jokes at least theyre kept to a bearable minimum. Greg is a middle kid all around. His toddler brother Manny gets all the attention while his taunting and cool teenage brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) has all the fun. Happily his parents (Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris) are not the usual clueless types; they advise and often connect with Greg. But life at school is another story. Greg is a blend of insecure cocky shy kind and self-absorbed. In other words he seems like a real kid. Gordon strikes all the right notes likable even when bursting with bravado or insolence. Greg is terrorized by Patty (Laine MacNeil) a grudge-bearing fiend in braids and mocked by the popular older boys when the equally small but feisty Fregley (Grayson Russell) beats him in wrestling. Chloe Grace Moretz who played Joseph Gordon-Levitts little sister in (500)Days of Summer adds a measure of acerbic wit as Angie who ruefully watches Gregs stumbling efforts tossing off the movies best lines as a wise-beyond-her-years middle-schooler. Greg has chutzpah to burn but he worries about his best buddy Rowley (Robert Capron) who still invites him to ""play"" -- instead of ""hang out""-- and isnt embarrassed to come to school wearing a colorful serape from his family vacation to Guatemala. Theres something silly-sweet about this movie. It avoids talking down to kids or being didactic while still projecting an overall wholesomeness. Director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs) has a wise sense of pacing and knows how to draw believable young performances mixing up sassy humor with naivete. He has effectively adapted Kinneys work and added his own stylistic touches. In an entry in his diary which he insists is actually a journal Greg muses ""Who wants to see a movie about a kid whos stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?"" Thanks to an endearing cast of characters and an energetic if light comic story we do. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Diary of a Wimpy Kid Comedy. Starring Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn. Directed by Thor Freudenthal. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It makes sense that most good kid-themed film comedies are about high school or elementary school. For most people who lived through it theres absolutely nothing funny about junior high. ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" based on Jeff Kinneys cartoon-heavy novel captures the epic tragedy of being a tween - at times a little too well. The writing is funny during individual moments but the cumulative result is a bit depressing with a surprising amount of negativity. If anything the pervasive doomed feeling of junior high is too accurate. Who wants to pay money to relive that? Part of the problem is the source material which is darkly humorous with its simple caricatures but suffers in the transition to live action where theres less distance between the audience and the action. The violence and cruelty displayed in Kinneys world becomes slightly unsettling with flesh-and-blood actors. The main character Greg Heffley is particularly unsympathetic. Theres no rooting interest because hes superficial scheming and - until the forced redemption at the end - a very unlikable kid. Zachary Gordon is sixth-grader Greg who must negotiate his clueless parents (an oddly bronzed Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn) and mean classmates to achieve popularity. He endures many frustrations most notably the social ascension of his geekier friend Rowley. A disagreement with Rowley makes Greg an outcast and Greg must make it right.

Greg (Zachary Gordon) realizes that his plans for middle school theatrical stardom didnOt exactly pan out. Photo Rob McEwan Twentieth Century Fox Review Pubescent pain in Diary of Wimpy Kid 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Director Thor Freudenthal (""Stuart Little"") seamlessly weaves Kinneys drawings into the film. There are also moments of strong observational humor in the school itself where Greg theorizes that a ""nuclear accident"" has caused his classmates to grow so much bigger and dorkier-looking over the summer. Scenes with older brother Rodrick are also sharp due mostly to a strong performance by Devon Bostick. (Much humor is mined from his band Loded Diper arguably the best movie musical group name since Citizen Dick from ""Singles."") The optimum audience for ""Diary"" may be older elementary school kids who will enjoy the gross-out humor and slapstick - and wont feel any post-traumatic stress disorder watching the crueler parts of the junior high experience. -- Advisory This film contains bathroom humor comic violence mild language and music from a really bad garage band.

I generally rank them by asking myself ""How many limbs would I hack off to escape this movies clutches?"" In the case of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" -- none. Maybe a toe. As curmudgeonly responses go this is pretty solid praise. The film is a live-action adaptation of Jeff Kinneys illustrated novel and while I miss his stick-figure character designs the cast is not bad. Zachary Gordon plays Greg who is trying to survive year one of middle school. Hes smart funny and deeply self-centered obsessed with his place in the popularity pecking order but scarcely noticing that his classmates have feelings too. Gordon is likable even when Greg is acting like a dork which is often. He has the exuberance and vulnerability to make Greg relatable not just a wimpy sad sack. His sidekick Rowley is an artless butterball with an unsinkably sweet disposition. Robert Capron plays this character with a few more layers than the stock fat kid part. As he begins to realize that his best friend wants to ditch him for the cool kids his bruised innocence and injured pride are touching. He calls to mind a junior-edition John Candy. The cool kids want no part of Greg and the film is essentially a series of calamities and humiliations befalling him. There are male and female bullies stern school authorities and any number of troubles that Greg brings on himself by acting pretentious. Rowleys instinctive goodness teaches Greg important lessons but it doesnt feel cloying. No kiddie movie would be complete without spazzy supporting characters booger jokes yucky food and toilet humor; ""Diary"" delivers them in abundance without straying too far from Disney Channel wholesomeness. Chloe Moretz the wise little sister from ""(500) Days of Summer"" pops up enjoyably as a student journalist responsible for exposes like ""Cheerleader Gains Pound"" This is a nice little movie.

Grayson Russell is at right.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted March 19 2010Greg Heffley deserves a special headstone in the graveyard of buried hopes that is middle school.A foot shorter than most of his classmates Greg (Zachary Gordon) is that picklepuss walking next to his naturally sweet best bud Rowley (Robert Capron). Greg desperately wants to be in the social swim but fails to gauge the riptide in the lunchroom that divides self-confident kids from the less secure.In short Greg is the middle school Everyboy stuck in the middle of middle school and in the middle of his family in between the bullying older brother and the beloved baby bro.His movie Diary of a Wimpy Kid based on the popular illustrated tween books by Jeff Kinney deserves a B- for effort and a C for execution. Like Gregs journal Diary is episodic and unformed. This is a strength in the books engagingly illustrated with droopy stick figures who like Greg are yet to be fleshed out. It is a weakness in the movie where more fully-defined characters would be helpful as guides.The movie has workmanlike uninspired direction from Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs) who gets an especially lovely performance from Capron a cheery type whose character gets adopted by the cool kids precisely because he doesnt care about being cool.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The tweener bestseller ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a gimmick book but an inspired one A fake diary -- blue lines blocky handwriting and all -- written from the point of view of a sixth-grader desperate to fit in. Greg Heffleys an everykid who makes bad choices and to whom bad things keep happening and thats just another day in cinderblock hell. What makes the book special are the line drawings ostensibly by Greg but really by author Jeff Kinney deft funny cartoons of thuggish big brothers blockhead best friends and bug-eyed class freaks. ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid the book is ""Malcolm in the Middle boiled down to a brilliant doodle.""Diary of a Wimpy Kid the movie returns Kinneys tale to live-action reality and the partys over. It starts brightly enough Greg (Zachary Gordon) heads out for the first day of school contending with a punk-wannabe brother (Devon Bostick) spudlike baby brother (Connor and Owen Fielding) doofus dad (Steve Zahn with wild eyes and a roll-on tan) and brisk mother (Rachael Harris the termagant of ""The Hangover). All he wants is to stand out in the Darwinian scrum that is middle school and all thats holding him back is his longtime best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) a blissfully naive fatty. Rowley rides a girls bike.Directed by Thor Freudenthal (""Hotel for Dogs) ""Diary includes a few wry Jean Shepherdesque observations of schoolyard mythology like the stinky cheese slice that has lain on the outdoor basketball court for months socially contaminating anyone foolish enough to touch it. Other aspects ring false What actual middle school hosts a mother-son dance? Thats just asking for trouble.The movies bigger problem is that its live-action Greg Heffley is a jerk. In his quest for instant fame our hero treats his friend like dirt trash-talks the schools perfectly reasonable alt-girl (Chloe Moretz) ditches a group of kindergartners in a construction pit in the rain (and blames it on Rowley) and otherwise behaves like a little Hun.I get it I get it -- redemption and life lessons await. But theyre awfully slow in coming and half-hearted when they appear and by then weve lost patience. Not many young actors can get to us like an adolescent wiseass over the long haul; Matthew Broderick got away with it in ""Ferris Buellers Day Off but just barely. Gordon is not Broderick.The upshot is that everyone at school prefers the guileless optimistic Rowley and a half hour in so do we. Remember that friend your parents said was a ""bad influence and tried to keep you away from until you realized they were right? ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid is about him. Maybe theres an interesting drama there but as a family comedy its a tough sell.Every now and then the movie reverts to the anarchic line drawings of the book and you breathe a sigh of relief. Theyre funny and they capture the way being 12 can look like an over-exaggerated black-and-white farce. ""Diary probably should have been handed over to a maverick animator like Marjane Satrapi of ""Persepolis or -- heres a novel idea -- Kinney himself.Of the live actors only Grayson Russell as uber-nerd Fregley comes close to being that sort of human cartoon (he practically has an exclamation point visible over his head). The others are stuck in tween-movie limboland neither character nor caricature. ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a movie that needs to go back to the drawing board -- literally.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In keeping with the stick-figure line-drawings and overall comic-book nature of Jeff Kinneys ultra-popular Diary Of A Wimpy Kid childrens books the film adaptation is cartoony both literally and figuratively. It periodically mixes in line-drawing animation in the style of the books to illustrate or punctuate the action; that visual sensibility livens things up considerably and gives the film a loose playfully arch American Splendor feel. At the same time the characters are almost as two-dimensional as their line-art counterparts and the story might be difficult even for kids to buy This is a world where the most popular kid in middle school can be the fat endlessly chipper nerd who likes wearing bright sweater-vests and publicly dancing with his mom in a routine theyve choreographed for some reason to Beastie Boys ""Intergalactic."" Still for all its ridiculousness its enthusiastic comic excess and its fart/booger/gross-out jokes Diary Of A Wimpy Kids heart is firmly in the right place. Zachary Gordon stars as Greg Heffley a weedy little twerp whos about to start middle school and is determined to be the most popular kid there. His overwhelming confidence in his own awesomeness is much of what makes the film fun; in spite of his avowed wimpiness hes no bullied sad-sack hes just having a hard time synching his expectations with reality. (His smugness leads to the films best gag as he confidently imagines his future as a rich well-muscled stud with a mansion and groveling servants comprised of his former tormenters.) Sadly his attempts to be popular all backfire and lead to him repeatedly betraying his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) that fat nerd who outpaces him socially just by enthusiastically being himself. Could there be some sort of heartfelt lesson there? Perhaps communicated via CGI assists and further gross-out humor? Director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel For Dogs) presents all this with upbeat spasticity; the films energy is relentless good-humored and over-the-top enough to be a little exhausting. Theres no subtlety or nuance whatsoever to the characters or story which tend to bray their feelings to the cheap seats. Fortunately those seats are likely to be full of little kids who are themselves full of Twizzlers and soda and thus are operating on the exact same wavelength.

The condemned are stranded between childhood and adolescence still awaiting the growth spurt that puberty will bring dodging bullies not yet aware of the opposite sex but becoming increasingly conscious of their social standing and public image. No one yearns to be popular quite so badly as Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) the eponymous narrator a bright and observant sixth-grader who will try anything to stand out. While some of his friends seemed to grow several inches and facial hair over the summer Greg remains stranded in boyhood weighing a puny 75 pounds. Hes also prone to public embarrassment caused by his oblivious best pal Rowley (Robert Capron) who doesnt understand why hollering ""Hey you want to come over and play?"" at school is no longer acceptable. Diary of a Wimpy Kid was originally conceived as an online comic and later as an illustrated novel by Jeff Kinney whose stick-figure sketches are incorporated throughout the film. The wise funny book was as appealing to grown-ups as it was to children focusing on the awkward phase of childhood when we all feel a little wimpy. The movie though is strictly kiddie fare willing to resort to an extreme close-up of a booger for laughs. Director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs) has a knack for working with young actors The leads make a likable engaging team (Capron is particularly good as the rotund cheerful Rowley) and they are surrounded by a fine ensemble of unknowns including Grayson Russell as Fregley the most-freckled and weird kid on the block. Only a miscast Devon Bostick as Gregs mean older brother strikes a false note. The movie sticks close to the incidents of Kinneys book from a misbegotten night of trick-or-treating to Gregs tryouts for a school production of The Wizard of Oz. The camera is usually set low at kids-eye leveland although the production looks astonishingly cheap (including some of the worst green-screen effects Ive ever seen) I doubt its intended audience will mind much. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an adequate adaptation of Kinneys novel but no replacement for the real thing. Read the book then see the movie. Diary of a Wimpy Kid (1/2 out of ) opens in South Florida theaters on Friday March 19.

An appealing if glossy adaptation of Jeff Kinneys hugely popular cartoon-illustrated novel ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is an amusing romp through the awkward years of middle school. As told from the perspective of its 11-year-old narrator its a spry fluffy comedy that given Kinneys track record -- the five-book ""Wimpy Kid"" series has sold 28 million copies to date -- should have no trouble drawing young viewers. Initiated as a series of online cartoons ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" made a big splash upon its 2007 publication as a ""novel in cartoons"" and its universal Everykid premise went on to spawn vigorous Internet fan activity. Eponymous hero Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon faintly recalling the young Fred Savage) is like an anti-Harry Potter He has no magic or any other discernible powers and his best asset is a sardonic take on middle school ""Let me just say that I think (its) the dumbest idea ever invented"" he writes. ""You got kids like me who havent hit their growth spurt yet mixed in with these gorillas who need to shave twice a day."" Helmer Thor Freudenthal (""Hotel for Dogs"") wastes no time establishing Gregs world Hes routinely hazed by his older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) humiliated by his little brother Manny (played by Connor and Owen Fielding) and often overlooked altogether by his parents (Rachael Harris Steve Zahn). His best friend is the doughy decidedly uncool Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron). In a hilarious though highly sitcomish introductory sequence that sets the pics tone Rodrick tricks Greg into waking up in the middle of the night insisting hes going to be late for his first day at his new school. From there things dont get much better. Middle school is a land of ritual humiliations from the physical terrors of a routine gym class to the rejections suffered during lunch as Greg Rowley and their nerdy pal Fregley (Grayson Russell) are relegated to the cafeteria floor. Nothing however is quite as terrifying as the prospect of touching ""the cheese"" -- a stinky slice of Swiss cheese that has laid on the playground asphalt for months and ripened into a stomach-churning shade of bluish yellow. Anyone who touches it one boy reports may unleash ""nuclear cooties"" on the school. Working from a script credited to Jackie Filgo Jeff Filgo Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah Freudenthal moves briskly through the various vignettes at once entertaining and painful. In the book Gregs wry observations were explicated with sparse black-and-white cartoons. Here Kinneys original drawings are likewise interspersed alongside the stream-of-consciousness musings of their narrator. Gregs stated goal of becoming a yearbook ""class favorite"" appears just as unlikely as a rise in his popularity ranking -- amusingly detailed in Kinneys accompanying sketches. As designed by Brent Thomas and lensed by Jack Green Gregs environment is a world of shiny surfaces sun-dappled trees and heightened colors. Theres little about this milieu that feels truly authentic which is notable given Sach and Judahs writing credit on ""Freaks and Geeks."" That show and the work of the late John Hughes remain the highwater marks for any take on adolescent angst; given what the genre can accomplish then its a bit of a shame that ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" keeps things so simple and superficial. Nevertheless its an enjoyable ride -- albeit one infused with enough gross-out moments to make you feel relieved youve left middle school far behind.

Comments (1) Diary of a Wimpy Kid Video Rated PG  92 minutes  2010 I did a double take at the end of this kids comedy when the PG rating advised me that ""some material may be unsuitable for children."" In fact its eminently suitable for children fully inhabiting their world and finding real laughs there without resorting to sentiment condescension or snarky in-jokes for the adults. The heroes (Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron) are a couple of junior-high losers whose friendship is tested by the shark-filled waters of their school; the movie is remarkably attuned to that awful period when youre not just known but sometimes doomed by the company you keep. The script was adapted from a novel by Jeff Kinney but director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs) probably deserves the credit for the movies unforced comic rhythm. By J.R.

Yet Americas brave junior high-schoolers continue to endure the experience to this day. Not that they have much choice. Author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney knows this and speaks dork-cool truth to cafeteria-bully power in an insanely popular book series now adapted into the delightful movie Diary of a Wimpy Kid. As millions of comforted readers young and older know the diary belongs to Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) a runty dude with the wherewithal to know hes surrounded by morons (his word not mine) but without the social skills to outwit outplay and outlast them. Or the knowledge of how to at least hang in until high school when the games only get tougher. Gregs diary -- or journal as hed prefer you call it -- is filled with the details of a million little humiliations shared with his fat endearingly easygoing friend Rowley (Robert Capron) a kind of Zen master in the shape of a Pillsbury doughboy. And the movie a jaunty and forthright production with a lively look reflecting the books illustrated pages does a great job of being in two places at once In the head and gangly bodies of kids and in the hearts of those of us who have survived grades 6-8. Director Thor Freudenthal (Hotel for Dogs) and his team of writers are at the top of their game in the case of the Cheese Touch a hideous ostracization that befalls any kid unlucky (or unaware) enough to touch a slice of Swiss cheese mottled with toxic mold that has stuck to the schoolyard blacktop for eons. Dont ask why the Cheese Touch results in nuclear cooties. It just does.

Screenwriters Jackie and Jeff Filgos respect for Kinneys sharply observant dialogue is the chief virtue of this fairly capable screen version. But the transition to live action is stylistically a trip to the ordinary in the hands of director Thor Freudenthal (though its still a step up from his excruciating Hotel for Dogs). For Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) a flawed wiseguy cursed with small stature and an inflated view of his own gifts middle school is an endless obstacle race against his own shortcomings as well as big bullies more evolved girls and stray boogers not to mention a slice of cootie-ridden cheese festering in the schoolyard. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is sweet and funny at either end but in between it sags with endless repetition of gross bodily functions and Gregs torment at the hands of larger angrier or more popular kids--in that order. Robert Capron is pure joy as the fat best friend who knows who he is enjoys life and practices loyalty by instinct.
