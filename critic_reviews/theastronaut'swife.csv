Ravich envelops you in scenes of luxurious foreboding quiet. My God the movie is quiet There are so many portentous pauses that sitting in a theater on a Saturday afternoon I was shushed by the person in front of me for the high-decibel crime of scribbling on my notepad. The films strategy is ""subtle"" in an obvious way The less that happens the more were meant to suck in our breath. We might have sucked in more of it though if there were greater novelty to the story of a Southern glamour-boy astronaut (Johnny Depp) who goes on a shuttle mission gets lost in space for two enigmatic minutes and then returns to earth normal yet somehow changed. One night after taking a corporate job in New York he forcefully seduces his wife (Charlize Theron) she becomes pregnant and... well whats growing in that womb is the big surprise. Could it possibly be a demon space alien? I kept hoping that ""The Astronauts Wife"" would turn into something more than a dutiful jumble of ""Rosemarys Baby"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Species II."" The movie is far from incompetent; it simply has too few surprises to justify its indulgent atmosphere of malignant revelation. The actors do what they can. Depp sporting blond highlights and an Elvis drawl uses his stoic calm to hint at inhuman malice and Charlize Theron offers her most vibrant performance yet. The suffering-pregnant-martyr role hasnt done much for any actress since Mia Farrow but Theron with her marvelously expressive baby face knows how to wallow in pain without drowning the audience in it. If were going to have actresses who look like supermodels heres one at least with the talent to set off emotional depth charges.

Top-flight work by professionals on both side of the camera cant quite disguise the predictability of the formulaic material. ""Rosemarys Baby"" gets an extraterrestrial twist in ""The Astronauts Wife"" an aggressively stylish but dramatically flaccid drama that plays like an upscale reprise of a 50s sci-fi potboiler. Top-flight work by professionals on both side of the camera cant quite disguise the predictability of the formulaic material. And the bland title -- perhaps more appropriate for a femme-skewing Lifetime feature -- is no help. New Line obviously isnt expecting much from this late-summer release which opened Aug. 27 without benefit of press previews and the studio isnt likely to be accused of undue pessimism. Sporting peroxided hair and a good-ol-boy drawl Johnny Depp stars as NASA shuttle pilot Spencer Armacost a vet space jock whos introduced during a pre-flight close encounter with Jillian (Charlize Theron) his beautiful schoolteacher wife. Out in space Armacost and fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) run into trouble during a routine repair of a malfunctioning satellite. Ground control loses contact with the pair for two minutes after the satellite explodes. Both men survive -- albeit just barely -- but are unconscious when they are brought back to Earth for long-term Ramp;R. Spencer is the first to fully recover much to his loving wifes relief. When he announces his decision to quit the space program and accept a private-sector job with a New York aerospace firm Jillian takes the news as a mixed blessing. Shes sorry to leave her friends and students in Florida but shes not exactly distraught to know her husband will no longer be risking his life in outer space. Things take a tragic turn at Spencers going-away party when Alex drops dead after a heated quarrel with his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy). The official cause of death according to NASA officials is ""a severe insult to the brain."" (Thats a description of a stroke not of the script.) But Natalie hints that something much worse happened to her husband -- and through him to her. ""Hes hiding inside me"" she tearfully tells Jillian at a post-funeral reception. Before Jillian can learn more however Natalie commits suicide. Working from his own script novice feature helmer Rand Ravich continues to alternate between stylized abstraction and moody naturalism as he segues to Manhattan. Jillian befriends the blunt-spoken wife (Blair Brown) of Spencers new boss (Tom Noonan) but remains vaguely uneasy about life as a corporate execs wife. Her peace of mind is further undermined by what she views as strange behavior from her husband. Jillian is surprised to learn that Spencer -- hired for his marquee value as a national hero -- is taking a role in designing a new fighter plane. Shes also unsettled though not entirely displeased by her husbands increased lustiness. Ravich waits until 40 minutes into ""Astronauts Wife"" before raising a shadow of doubt about Jillians perceptions. During a telephone conversation between Jillian and her youngster sister Nan (Clea DuVall) the audience discovers that following the death of her parents years earlier Jillian experienced such terrible doom-laden dreams that she required psychiatric help. So the question arises Is she just imagining things again? It comes as no surprise that Jillians worst fears are entirely justified. Even so ""Astronauts Wife"" does manage to generate mild suspense especially after Jillian discovers she is pregnant with twins. Pic flirts with the notion that like other pregnant women in her discussion group Jillian feels increasingly isolated from her husband simply because he couldnt possibly understand what shes going through. Trouble is Spencer may know everything about whats going on inside Jillian. At least thats the impression Jillian gets after viewing a cautionary videotape prepared by Sherman Reese (Joe Morton) a former NASA doctor who fully understands why Spencer is so eagerly awaiting the arrival of his offspring. Convincingly maneuvering through a wide range of emotions Theron hits the right balance of strong-willed resilience and moist-eyed vulnerability as Jillian. Her performance is more than compelling enough to sustain interest for long stretches when shes the only person onscreen. Depp is aptly ambiguous in what amounts to a supporting role though he is hamstrung by his inability to upend audience expectations with any truly surprising twists of character. Morton is the standout among the supporting players infusing urgency and credibility into a small but key part. ""The Astronauts Wife"" tends to drift into a kind of dream state between dramatic high points recalling the muted meanderings of ""Meet Joe Black."" Quite often Ravich relies heavily on his tech collaborators -- most notably lenser Allen Daviau and editors Steve Mirkovich and Tim Alverson -- to jumpstart the intensity with visual flourishes. (A typically self-conscious touch Jillian stands stock-still in a hallway of her school while students filmed with a speeded-up camera whiz by her.) British actress Samantha Eggar adds to the mix of quirky affectations by playing Jillians obstetrician with a thick German accent. Why? Well why not? When a pic is this unremarkably generic every eccentricity helps. The Astronauts WifeProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Mad Chance production. Produced by Andrew Lazar.

"The Astronauts Wife After a Space Jaunt Hes Odd But Still Loves His Wife August 28 1999 FILM REVIEW The Astronauts Wife After a Space Jaunt Hes Odd But Still Loves His Wife Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By JANET MASLIN he Astronauts Wife"" arrived Friday in a veil of mystery. How could a thriller starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron be so bad that New Line Cinema which has been in no hurry to release this film would not risk screening in advance for the press. Answer as directed by Rand Ravich its actually a lot better than these circumstances suggest. But as written by Ravich a screenwriter directing his debut feature ""The Astronauts Wife"" is ridiculously derivative. Perhaps no one has told the exact story of an astronaut who experiences two minutes worth of strangeness in space and then comes home seeming well different. But when his wife Jillian (Ms. Theron) becomes pregnant it hardly seems coincidental to find her in Mia Farrows hairdo from ""Rosemarys Baby."" Ms. Therons role in the much sharper ""Devils Advocate"" was another variation on that theme. Peter Mountain/New Line Cinema Charlize Theron left and Johnny Depp as a couple who find strangeness invading their marriage in ""The Astronauts Wife.""",http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/082899astronaut-film-review.html,200,theastronaut'swife5,theastronaut'swife,nytimes

Mick LaSalle Chronicle Staff Critic Published 400 am Saturday August 28 1999 Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 `Astronauts Wife Almost a Blast / Whats a woman to do when her husband returns from space an alien? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE ASTRONAUTS WIFE Supernatural thriller. Starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. Directed by Rand Ravich. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) She married a space alien. To be precise she married a great guy and he became a space alien. This is not a metaphor for a bad marriage but rather the actual premise of ""The Astronauts Wife"" which opened yesterday. Johnny Depp goes into space and comes back just a little bit weird. His wife played by Charlize Theron has to deal with it. ""The Astronauts Wife"" is a major release that wasnt screened in advance for critics. That usually portends disaster but thats not the case this time. The film is as good as or better than the average Hollywood release. Its scary. Its well-acted. Its filmed with a degree of flash and elegance. About the only negative thing that can be said about it is that it doesnt quite satisfy at the finish. The script needs something more -- Im not pretending to know what it is. But the ending leaves the audience with an empty feeling and a few nagging questions Who is this alien? Where is he from? What does he want? Until that point ""The Astronauts Wife"" is a strong thriller. Depp plays a shuttle astronaut who loses contact with NASA for two minutes. The mission is terminated and hes brought back to earth. He is the same as ever except that he no longer wants to be a pilot. And hes rough with his wife in bed. The story has more than a passing resemblance to ""Rosemarys Baby."" The wife gets pregnant with twins and begins to wonder what exactly she is carrying. Joe Morton has a nice role as a NASA scientist driven to the brink of madness by figuring out that the astronaut is an alien. Depp is fine though the one-note role calls for him to be only calm and spooky. As the wife Theron gets the real emotional workout and shes up to it. In fact the strength of her performance seduces director Rand Ravich to leave in more of it than necessary. She has a couple of breakdowns that stretch on needlessly. The picture shows signs of heavy editing -- lines heard in the movies trailer are not in the finished film. The movie might not be perfect but it deserved better than to be dumped into theaters. I rather enjoyed it.

"Astronauts Wife The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; astronaut-s-wife-the ) Astronauts Wife The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Astronauts Wife is the latest demonstration of how a good ""high concept"" does not necessarily translate into a decent motion picture. With its Invasion of the Bodysnatchers-inspired storyline this movie could have been an effectively creepy science fiction/horror movie but a lazy script and howlingly bad dialogue sinks the project. In the process several potentially rich opportunities and a pair of credible lead performances are wasted. To its credit The Astronauts Wife isnt interested in telling a ""standard"" big budget alien invasion story (such as the one presented in Independence Day). Instead it wants to keep things low-key like in The Arrival with a dash of Contact thrown in for good measure. It also avoids the Species approach of throwing copious gore sex and violence at the audience (although the film could have used a little more of each to liven things up). The problem is that the mix of ingredients are in the wrong proportions. So instead of getting thought-provoking science fiction were stuck with something thats bizarrely paced and occasionally cheesy. The film opens with promise. Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) is an astronaut about ready to blast into orbit on a routine space shuttle mission. His wife Jillian (Charlize Theron) is worried about him as usual so after hes in space he places a ship-to-shore phone call to reassure her. It does the trick - until she catches a TV news update reporting that her husband and another astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) have been involved in an accident. She and Alexs wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) are whisked off to Mission Control where a poker-faced official Sherman Reese (Joe Morton) informs them that their husbands are alive and recovering. Apparently they were caught in an explosion outside of the shuttle and were out of contact for two minutes. After Spencer and Alex are back on Earth and have recovered from their experience things seem to go back to normal at least for a while. But both men are exhibiting personality changes. Spencer decides to leave NASA relinquishing his lifelong dream for a desk job in New York City. On the evening of his farewell party Alex suffers a stroke and dies. Only days later his distraught wife after babbling something incoherent about hearing strange whispers kills herself. Jillian is left wondering what really happened during those two mysterious minutes of her husbands life. The problem is not the overall plot which could have formed the foundation of an entertaining movie but the manner in which writer/director Rand Ravich (making his debut behind the camera after penning scripts like Candyman 2) chooses to develop it. The pace is sluggish. After a solid start the movie loses its way and spends a long time spinning its wheels as the characters take an inordinate amount of time to discover what the viewers have realized from the beginning - that Spencer literally isnt himself. Then there are a couple of potentially powerful scenes that are robbed of all impact by Ravichs heavy-handed approach. In one for example Jillian contemplates terminating a pregnancy because her unborn twins might in some way be contaminated. Instead of allowing Theron to underplay the scene and bring out the full tragedy through her performance Ravich goes for over-the-top hysteria that approaches campiness. Theron spends the entire scene staggering around the bathroom and moaning about how she cant do it/has to do it. And this isnt the only instance when something is handled in this manner. Rarely can a screenplay claim such consistently bad dialogue. It doesnt just mar an occasional scene or two but is a pervasive problem throughout. I actually felt embarrassed for Johnny Depp (Donnie Brasco) and Charlize Theron (Mighty Joe Young) the talented thespians forced to spout such utter nonsense. In fact aside from a couple of awkward scenes these two do solid jobs. Early in the film they effectively convey the deep love and companionship between Jillian and Spencer (although Ravich doesnt do much with those feelings once theyre on screen). Supporting Depp and Theron are the always reliable Joe Morton (Blues Brothers 2000) Nick (son of John) Cassavetes and Donna Murphy (Star Trek Insurrection). To add insult to injury the conclusion is laughably absurd with a few token special effects thrown into the mix in an attempt to disguise a silly and misguided ""twist"" that is neither credible nor satisfying. In fact the climactic scene will force those who have previously been willing to suspend their disbelief to throw up their hands in defeat. Its ludicrous that Ravich could seriously expect anyone in the audience to accept this resolution. Then again the ending really isnt much different from the rest of The Astronauts Wife - a wasted opportunity.

Ravich envelops you in scenes of luxurious foreboding quiet. My God the movie is quiet There are so many portentous pauses that sitting in a theater on a Saturday afternoon I was shushed by the person in front of me for the high-decibel crime of scribbling on my notepad. The films strategy is ""subtle"" in an obvious way The less that happens the more were meant to suck in our breath. We might have sucked in more of it though if there were greater novelty to the story of a Southern glamour-boy astronaut (Johnny Depp) who goes on a shuttle mission gets lost in space for two enigmatic minutes and then returns to earth normal yet somehow changed. One night after taking a corporate job in New York he forcefully seduces his wife (Charlize Theron) she becomes pregnant and... well whats growing in that womb is the big surprise. Could it possibly be a demon space alien? I kept hoping that ""The Astronauts Wife"" would turn into something more than a dutiful jumble of ""Rosemarys Baby"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Species II."" The movie is far from incompetent; it simply has too few surprises to justify its indulgent atmosphere of malignant revelation. The actors do what they can. Depp sporting blond highlights and an Elvis drawl uses his stoic calm to hint at inhuman malice and Charlize Theron offers her most vibrant performance yet. The suffering-pregnant-martyr role hasnt done much for any actress since Mia Farrow but Theron with her marvelously expressive baby face knows how to wallow in pain without drowning the audience in it. If were going to have actresses who look like supermodels heres one at least with the talent to set off emotional depth charges.
