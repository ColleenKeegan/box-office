E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Guilt is a terrible thing. It can also produce lousy movies. ""To Save a Life is cheesy on matters of God and conscience. A hair-flipping basketball jock named Jake Taylor (Randy Wayne) rues the suicide of his baby-faced childhood friend. Jake spent years ignoring Roger (Robert Bailey Jr.) who walked with a limp after he threw himself in front of a speeding car to save Jake when they were kids. One boy became popular. The other became a pariah. Sick of all the neglect Roger walks into his California school and shoots himself.Jakes not the only person with regrets. Before his death Roger walked into a Christian youth group for help. The pastor (Joshua Weigel) who blew him off feels bad too. He succeeds at bringing Jake into the fold. Jake has his early doubts but before the movies first hour is over hes railing against the hypocrisy of the partiers and potheads in his midst.The writer Jim Britts and the director Brian Baugh use the impressionable characters and utterly basic message-mindedness of an after-school special to make a kind of sweet-natured recruitment film. Heres Jake to his skeptical girlfriend ""I want to introduce you to Chris. Thats the pastors name but you get the point. ""To Save a Life wants to show the light to cutters suicidals fakers unhappy couples and unborn children.Everybody means well but the earnestness is embarrassing. At some point Roger acts out several of his cry-for-help blog entries. The male actors all close-talk each other in the most uncomfortable way. The house parties are unconvincing the hip-hop bad (""put your cups down playuhs) and beach-rock worse (""Take another shot-shot thinking why not-not). Young Christians deserve better movies. I know what youre thinking though Whats this have to do with anything? Hows the God? Truth be told Hes pretty good.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

New Song Pictures hide caption toggle caption New Song Pictures To Save a Life Director Brian BaughGenre DramaRunning Time 120 minutes Rated PG-13 Mature themes involving teen suicide drinking drugs and sexWith Randy Wayne Deja Kreutzberg Joshua Weigel Steven Crowder and Robert Bailey Jr. Watch Clips Fakers/Is It Worth It? Rogers Monologue In the world created by director Brian Baugh and screenwriter Jim Britts obstacles can be overcome depression vanquished hearts and minds won and -- as the title implies -- lives saved all with the simple turn of an earnestly delivered phrase. That eloquent earnestness is a power attained the film suggests through the development of a relationship with God. Whether or not you buy the easy solutions presented by the film depends in large part on whether you are on board with the Christian philosophy that underpins it. Church-sponsored filmmaking has become a niche market of its own in recent years and even the major studios have picked up on its lucrative potential by starting specialty divisions devoted to faith-based filmmaking. In that subgenre of modestly budgeted films To Save a Life is miles ahead in terms of production values and a conscious avoidance of overt proselytizing. It will likely be an enormous success with the evangelical communities at which its targeted. That doesnt save it from being an utter failure outside that narrow context. The film documents one high school basketball stars discovery of faith. Jake Taylor (Randy Wayne) seems to have it all Hes dating the schools most beautiful cheerleader Amy (Deja Kreutzberg); hes soon headed to the University of Louisville on a full athletic scholarship; hes generally enjoying his senior year as an attractive athletic golden-haired high school god. But the first assaults on his comfortable life are thrown at him quickly. The film opens on Jake standing at a funeral away from the ceremony in that solitary space reserved (in the movies) for guilty mourners. Theres a glowering mixture of sadness and confusion on his face an expression that will turn out to be one of about three notes that Wayne brings to the performance. In a series of seizure-inducing rapid-fire flashbacks Baugh shows that the funeral is for a suicidal outcast who was once Jakes best friend -- and that that friendship ended when Jake ditched him to join the cool crowd. The story of Jakes coming to terms with his own responsibility for the tragedy would be more than enough narrative material for one movie. But Britts loads the story down with subplots enough to drive a half-dozen after-school specials. Not coincidentally thats also the treacly tone that Baugh allows to pervade the proceedings. So in addition to the suicide of his former pal Jake is also confronted with teen-drama staples like divorce (his parents are headed for it) premarital sex (he has it) underage drinking (he does it) and drug use. (He just says no -- heroes of Christian films can only sink so far apparently.) On top of that Britts piles on even heavier hitters like teen pregnancy abortion and self-mutilation. To its credit To Save a Life can be as critical of hypocrisy within the church as it is of the emptiness of a life outside of it insistently promoting the value of togetherness and social-support structures over duty-bound church attendance. Those are valuable messages. But the film only pays lip service to the severity of the problems teens can face offering up little in the way of tangible solutions. It becomes little more than a parade of cliches and two-dimensional stereotypes. Worse it does a disservice to the many real honestly troubled teens out there looking for a lifeline.

Credit C. Clifford Jones/Samuel Goldwyn Films Teenage martyrdom -- the piety of it all. In ""To Save a Life"" Jake (Randy Wayne) is a star high school basketball player; Amy (Deja Kreutzberg) is his cheerleader girlfriend; and Roger (Robert Bailey Jr.) is his childhood friend who years ago crippled himself protecting Jake from an approaching automobile. When Jakes popularity pushes Roger out of his life Roger comes to school brandishes a gun and shoots himself.Now Jake is wrought with guilt and his friends reckless partying isnt helping. Chris (Joshua Weigel) a hip pastor invites him to a church youth group and Jake reaches out to Jonny (Sean Michael Afable) a poor alienated friend of Rogers and a ""cutter"" who marks his arms with razors.Amy soon fears that shes losing Jake to the church and Jakes buddy Doug (Steven Crowder) persuades other students to repudiate him a metaphor for the delusional perception that Christianity is oppressed in America. When Amy learns that shes pregnant by Jake hes not ready to let her have an abortion though a baby would certainly threaten his college plans to say nothing of her own. Even worse hes questioning his faith.The director Brian Baugh was the cinematographer for the conservative screed ""An American Carol"" a clumsy parody of Michael Moore movies and here similar politics come in adolescent camouflage. The film would be a mere nuisance if not for its shameless exploitation of school shootings to advance its agenda.

"Reviews Parts are better than the whole of Drool - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesCAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS Reviews Parts are better than the whole of DroolAlso reviewed To Save a Life Watercolors Murder in Fashion MisconceptionsJanuary 22 2010 Writer-director Nancy Kissam has said that her alternately blithe and darkly comic ""Drool"" her first feature would be ""a John Waters-esque campy revenge comedy"" only to discover her characters werent as vapid as she thought. Shes right because as bizarre as her plot is her people seem real in their reactions to their lives escalating absurdities. Shes not yet as able to shape a film or to shift tones as effectively as her actors but even though ""Drool"" rambles and ultimately slides into overly obvious make-believe Kissam emerges as a fearless risk-taker of promise. The Fleeces of a small Oklahoma town are mired in misery. The father (Oded Fehr) a wife-beating racist male-chauvinist pig is a factory worker in nearby Tulsa who submits to humiliating demands to hold on to his job. His bright 15-year-old daughter (Ashley Duggan Smith) believes she must grant sexual favors to be accepted and her 13-year-old brother (Christopher Newhouse) is a racist. The dutiful wife and mom Anora (Laura Harring) lives in fear of her husband. But a new next-door neighbor a free-spirited glamorous cosmetics saleswoman Imogene (vivacious Jill Marie Jones) is about to turn Anoras life upside down. That the two women develop a mutual attraction and that Imogene is African American make for a precarious situation for Anora and her family to say the least. Ultimately ""Drool"" turns into a road movie in which mother and children start to evolve persuasively yet along the way it loses touch with reality. Its a movie of amusing parts rather than a satisfying whole. -- Kevin Thomas ""Drool."" MPAA rating Unrated. Running time 1 hour 25 minutes. At the Sunset 5 West Hollywood. Life is absorbing redemption story The teen drama ""To Save a Life"" nicely directed by Brian Baugh from a script by Jim Britts manages to be appealing poignant and inspiring in ways that are gentle and quite real. This smartly calibrated film also pulls off something rare by presenting religious commitment as something thats not only potentially healing and elevating but also kind of cool. Thats because the films God-following teens are largely attractive progressive types self-aware kids dealing with a convincing array of social and personal issues. This is especially true of golden boy Jake Taylor (a winning Randy Wayne) a high school basketball star searching for redemption after Roger (Robert Bailey Jr.) the childhood pal he selfishly left behind unexpectedly commits suicide. With the help of an affable youth pastor (Joshua Weigel) and an embracing group of new churchgoing friends Jake begins to deal with his guilt and break away from unproductive behaviors and relationships. Among the latter is longtime girlfriend Amy (Deja Kreutzberg) a mean girl-lite with some serious growing up to do. Though the movie takes too long to bring Jakes life-changing journey full circle and ties up its various strands with some predictable bows this is a deftly acted generally absorbing cautionary tale with wider allure than its faith-based label may imply. -- Gary Goldstein ""To Save a Life."" MPAA rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving teen suicide teen drinking some drug content disturbing images and sexuality. Running time 2 hours. In general release. 3 gay-themed films run gamut By far the best of three gay-themed films from Regent Releasing that open today in regular runs on separate screens at the Sunset 5 is ""Watercolors"" David Oliveras wrenching tale of first love. Tall rangy Kyle Clare makes an indelible impression as deeply troubled sexually confused high school swim team standout Carter Melman who dreams of an athletic championship. Carter is drawn to brainy Danny (Tye Olson) a gifted artist and object of chronic campus homophobia who swiftly falls in love with Carter. Olson is splendid too as is the rest of the cast which includes Jeffrey Lee Woods as Carters well-meaning but killjoy father a shaky 60 days from his last drink; Casey Kramer as Olsons staunch loving mother and especially an always- distinctive Karen Black as Olsons supportive but tough-minded art teacher. Olympic champion Greg Louganis is not surprisingly perfectly cast as Carters no-nonsense swimming coach. This is a graceful film that shows how people apply increasing pressure on Carter without perceiving his underlying distress and instability. ""Murder in Fashion"" written by Linda Boroff and directed by Ben Waller is a straightforward well-paced resourcefully made account of handsome but crazed Andrew Cunanans 1997 serial killing spree that culminated with his fatal shooting of Gianni Versace in Miami Beach. Cunanan had long been obsessed with Versace dreaming of becoming a model or even a lover of the famed designer.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCairo bureau changes Fleishman to Hollywood King to EgyptOctober 23 2013Paperback writers Two survivor storiesMarch 6 2011Pride squandered redemption foundApril 25 2003On View  Faith Lies and Redemption  TNTS JACOB IS A...December 4 1994Volunteers With Performers Souls at Heart of AgencyMay 19 1994MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewWest HollywoodEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-capsules22-2010jan22,0,7010167.story",200,tosavealife4,tosavealife,latimes

Just as representations of human sexuality on film are often unpleasantly twisted by the grotesqueries of the porn industry so too are filmic representations of religious conversion homogenized by the faith-based entertainment industry. Case in point Debutante director Brian Baughs ""To Save a Life"" which hints at becoming a thoughtful portrait of a teens spiritual crisis then abandons all narrative integrity to hit its church-mandated marks which range from well-meaning to eyebrow-raising. Grassroots marketing via church youth groups could generate decent business though ""Fireproof"" numbers seem far out of reach. Film toplines Randy Wayne as Jake a high school basketball star shaken by the sudden in-school suicide of a childhood friend whom he had long since discarded in a quest to join the in-crowd and snag the local hot chick (Deja Kreutzberg). Haunted by guilt he eventually winds up in the orbit of a charismatic youth group leader (Josh Weigel) who urges him to explore his spiritual side (the Bible is mentioned but never actually seen or quoted) much to the dismay of his friends and girlfriend. The pics depiction of high school social dynamics can lean toward the risible -- a beer-pong sequence seems to have been copied shot-for-shot from an Asher Roth video -- and the script contains more than its share of clunkers. Yet elements of Jakes spiritual dilemma ring true and in less compromising hands an examination of the wedge that religious conversion drives into existing relationships could have yielded great insight. But the films invocations of faiths knottier issues are defanged by its easy answers (teenage pregnancy? Just let the youth pastor handle it) and many supplemental dramas that swell the running time to a bloated two hours. The missionary impulse is an essential element of Christian faith so to fault a Christian film for proselytizing is ultimately a meaningless criticism. Nonetheless ""To Save a Lifes"" agenda is proclaimed so loudly that it tramples all over the films quieter elements and often seems designed less to steer viewers toward salvation than toward a very specific (and at times borderline cultish) type of suburban youth ministry -- unsurprisingly the films scripter is himself a youth group leader. This slant starts to ring a few alarm bells especially as the pic sets up an opposition between an ineffectual by-the-Book church pastor and the endlessly empathetic younger minister. Pic is well constructed and production values are often of a surprisingly high quality though a mawkish perpetually swelling score makes the whole effort feel slightly cheap.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - What would teenage Jesus do if he felt responsible for a childhood pals suicide knocked up his girlfriend and played too much beer pong? Blond-haired blue-eyed high school basketball star Jake (Randy Wayne) gets right with the Lord swaying to the Christian rock of Souled Out at his new youth group and reaching out to Trenchcoat Mafia types like self-cutter Jonny (Sean Michael). The first-time effort of both director Brian Baugh and writer Jim Britts (who also produced) To Save a Life wants to rescue kids from the Satanic messages of Gossip Girl--a benign even worthy enough objective but must alternatives to empty materialistic adolescence require baptism in the Pacific? The films handling of teenage pregnancy follows Junos with Kimya Dawson lyrics supplanted by a repugnant linguistic twist regarding ""choice."" For all its initial attempts to soften its religiosity--the SoCal setting the youth pastor whos profoundly sympathetic to his charges the wispy-banged messiah whos gifted at using social-networking sites--To Save a Life is about as subtle as this closing credit ""The producers would like to thank GOD.""
