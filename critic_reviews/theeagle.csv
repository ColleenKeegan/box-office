And amazingly it mostly works. Its the story of Eddie Edwards a British ski-jumper who won the crowd at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics just for showing up. Britain hadnt fielded a ski-jumper for decades and Edwards slightly heavy and nearsighted seemed representative of the common man out of his element. But spectators responded to his boyish enthusiasm and he became a mini-celebrity. In Dexter Fletchers new film Eddie (played by Taron Egerton whom you may remember as a young good-looking novice spy saving the world inA Kingsman The Secret Service) is portrayed at least at first as a klutzy adventurous simpleton falling over himself trying to excel at the right sport -- anyA sport -- for his shot at the big time. Much of Edwardss story has been exaggerated and enhanced for the film apparently in an effort to double down on the underdog sports movie cliches Theres Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) his gruff alcoholic (and apparently fictional) coach himself a former jumper with something to prove; there are scheming British Olympic officials determined to maintain the elite upper-crust ethos of their team; theres Eddies unsupportive working-class builder father to go with his patient somewhat bemused mother. Even Christopher Walken shows up briefly as Bronsons own former coach now a kind of guru of international ski jumping. Other athletes and officials chuckle and sneer at Eddie. (""Idiot. The Englishman will die"" one of them says in subtitles.) But the film isnt even trying to pretend to be true to life or even to teach us a lesson. Fletcher keeps the tone light having fun with the cliches -- with the montages and the heroic walking shots and with the broad performances. Jackman is well cast as a bruised broken stud. Everyone else sneers or smiles as required. Meanwhile Egertons shticky stylized performance grows on us; we appreciate the characters delusion and determination. Theres something very human about someone trying to do something for which they know theyre fundamentally ill-suited and the film knows how to highlight that humanity. It has fun showing us montages of Eddie crashing early on but later on it shows us the vertigo-inducing distance and elevation of the ski-jump; our anticipation mixes with nausea. The film is simple maybe even simplistic but not stupid. Anyone who has ever watched a young child with dreams of sporting glory can recognize the elemental pull of this type of story. But by keeping things simple -- by refusing to burden us with too many facts or too much portent or complicated characters -- Eddie the Eagle channels that spirit well. It wont win any medals but it earns its place. Tagsmoviesmovie revieweddie the eaglehugh jackman Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

"Eddie the Eagle | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; eddie-the-eagle ) Eddie the Eagle (United Kingdom 2016) February 26 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Eddie the Eagle is a classic ""underdog overachieves"" sports story complete with all the trappings. Its the kind of film that pulls out all the stops to get an applauding audience to its feet. Terms like ""feel good"" and ""upbeat"" apply. Director Dexter Fletchers biopic is warm and cuddly and largely without villains. Its all about beating the odds overcoming the system and attaining ones dream. Like the real Eddies 1988 Olympic experience however the movies memory is likely to fade fast. As those who watched the Calgary Olympics may remember Eddie became an international celebrity - not because he won anything but because he failed spectacularly. He didnt have an ""agony of defeat"" moment but as the lone British skiing long-jumper in competition he finished last in both the 70m and 90m events. He was feted for his exuberance and antics which appealed to the predominantly Canadian and U.S. crowds. One could almost wonder whether this was part of the birth movement of reality TV following individuals with charisma and drive instead of those with innate talent.  In the late 1980s Eddie was a controversial figure in ski jumping circles; new rules were devised to eliminate the possibility of another such ""black eye."" Indeed despite trying three more times (in 1992 1994 and 1998) Eddie was unable to qualify for another Olympics. Eddie the Eagle fictionalizes the main characters life to the point where its almost unrecognizable. The only truths that remain in Sean Macaulay and Simone Keltons screenplay are those that were captured by the cameras in Calgary. Taron Egerton reproduces Eddies offbeat charm turning him into an Aspergers afflicted champion of the undertrodden. Hugh Jackman lends some star power to the otherwise low-key film playing Eddies hard-drinking American coach Bronson Peary. A significant part of Eddie the Eagle is about the bonding between these two men and how Pearys attitude toward Eddie changes from annoyance to admiration. This relationship works in the context of a movie but nothing about it is grounded in reality. In fact Peary isnt a real person and all the training activities in Germany are made up. The real Eddie trained in Lake Placid under the guidance of two men neither of whom was named ""Bronson"" or ""Peary."" Eddie the Eagle is The Karate Kid crossed with Rudy. Here the role of Mr. Miyagi is played by Jackman and theres no ""wax on wax off."" It makes a refreshing change however to find a sports movie that isnt about winning. The movie doesnt try to trick us into thinking Eddie might be able to capture a medal in Calgary. This isnt about his becoming enmeshed in a medal competition; its about him completing his jumps. Its about personal courage and from that perspective tells an engaging story. It doesnt make demands on the viewer. This becomes the third feature film to be set at least in part at the Calgary games. The others were 1992s The Cutting Edge and 1993s Cool Runnings both of which are about unlikely competitors achieving greatness (although The Cutting Edge was as much a romance as a sports movie). Eddie the Eagles filmmakers have admitted to being influenced by Cool Runnings and the Jamaican bobsled team gets a call-out. The ski jump sequences are effectively realized by Fletcher and his cinematographer George Richmond. By using a combination of point-of-view shots close-ups and distant footage of a double the illusion of Egerton-as-Eddie is maintained. As tempting as it might be to promote this as a ""family film"" theres a sequence contained herein that may give some parents pause. As part of the training Eddie is asked to envision the jump and landing as having an orgasm during sex with Bo Derek. Yes you read that right. This is how Bronson teaches Eddie to let go. Euphemisms are employed but theres no mistaking the intention. The movie isnt really for children anyway - with its nods to nostalgia (which includes a Vangelis-inspired electronic score) Eddie the Eagle will find greater favor with older viewers than younger ones. Eddie the Eagle is hokey. Its cliched manipulative and old-fashioned. Yet despite those qualities (or perhaps because of them) its charming. Even cynics may find themselves cracking a secret smile on the way out of the theater. This isnt great art but it is good fun.

(A few samples a naysaying father a doubly naysaying English Olympic committee a generally uncooperative body a drunken has-been for a coach a lack of experience in his chosen event of ski jumping...the list goes on.) Taron Egerton doesnt have to do much but grin and grimace to convey Edwardss ""too dumb to know when hes beat"" charm; the more interesting work is left to Hugh Jackman as the old-timer who coulda been something. (He lands somewhere between Dennis Hopper in Hoosiers and Jason Sudeikis in Race a respectable showing.) Director Dexter Fletcher knows that it takes a delicate touch to serve up corn this sweet and he mostly manages it. For every easy eye-rolling bit theres a moment of genuine emotion; the champion jumpers pre-climax speech on what matters in sport is downright joyful. 2016. This movie is not currently in theaters.

"Eddie the Eagle review Olympic ski jumper wins us over - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Eddie the Eagle review Olympic ski jumper wins us over Trailer Eddie the Eagle Watch the official trailer for ""Eddie the Eagle."" (ScreenPlay) Watch the official trailer for ""Eddie the Eagle."" (ScreenPlay) Katie WalshTribune News Service A cheery tale of unlikely sporting triumph ""Eddie the Eagle"" directed by Dexter Fletcher offers up a retro feel-good yarn about the power of determination. While its often cookie-cutter sports movie conventional youd have to be stone-hearted to remain un-charmed by the story of real-life British ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards played by rising star Taron Egerton.As a kid enthusiastic young Eddie declares hes going to be an Olympian despite his corrective leg braces and coke bottle glasses to the bemusement of his sweetly supportive mum (Jo Hartley) and disappointment of his pragmatic working class dad (Keith Allen). Training his sights on the Winter Olympics he finds some success as a downhill skier until the British Olympic team rudely turns up their noses up at him. But nothing stops Eddie and armed with the knowledge that Britain hasnt fielded a ski jumper since the 1920s he figures the odds are in his favor to qualify for the Games. Because winning isnt what Eddie cares about -- all he wants is to participate. This point is reiterated by the repetition of a quote from Pierre de Coubertin that ""the most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part."" For Eddie taking part has always been the goal but ultimately he discovers his real challenge is to take himself seriously and therefore have others take him seriously.But Eddie wins hearts with his unabashed chipper goofiness. Lacking natural talent and training he relies on his can-do spirit and eagerness to fling himself down increasingly tall ski jumps. Certified hunk Egerton (""Kingsman"" ""Legend"") has been given a typical Hollywood treatment to render himself homely -- outlandish glasses and frizzy hair. But Egerton proves himself to be a performer lacking in vanity and gifted with physical chops adding a sideways grimace and bumbling gait to fully transform himself. There are many who will see ""Eddie the Eagle"" as a British ""Cool Runnings."" Its an apt comparison and there is a reference to the Jamaican bobsled team. Both films culminate at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and tell the tales of misfit athletes with indefatigable spirits striving for a piece of glory. Though their quests seem impossible and there are plenty of naysayers along the way to remind them of that these oddball heroes with humble hearts and pure intentions provide great inspiration in just sticking their necks out; in their sheer will a willingness to want and to work for a bit of greatness. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. The screenplay by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton takes liberties with the real Eddie Edwards story. Eddie finds a drunken washed-up American ski jumper in Germany to train him Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) a character who has been made up out of whole cloth as the real Edwards trained with a pair of coaches in Lake Placid. But autobiographical details arent what this storys about. A foil to Eddie Jackman provides a frisson of sexy danger and his outcast status allows a doubling down on the dark horse qualities that make eventual success taste that much better. The manipulation of the story details demonstrates the filmmakers skill in execution -- like a perfect ski jump they lean into that sweet spot of lovable underdog sports flick and stick the landing.""Eddie the Eagle"" -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some suggestive material partial nudity and smoking)Running time 145Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune A version of this article appeared in print on February 26 2016 in the Arts + Entertainment section of the Chicago Tribune with the headline ""Olympic ski jumper wins us over in feel-good film - `Eddie the Eagle"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Eddie the Eagle Gods of Egypt review Mortals combat deities audience loses Magical Girl review A dying girls wish with a twist Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-eddie-eagle-mov-rev-0223-20160223-story.html,200,theeagle3,theeagle,chicagotribune

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 26 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 26 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Dexter Fletcher Written by Sean Macaulay Simon Kelton Starring Taron Egerton Hugh Jackman Classification PG Genre biopic Year 2016 Country USA/U.K./Germany Language English Perhaps when it comes to a movie about Eddie the Eagle low expectations are par for the course - or whatever the correct ski-jumping metaphor would be.The British athlete who came dead last in both his events at the Calgary Winter Games in 1988 seemed to have travelled to Canada mainly to provide comic relief. He was the guy along with the Jamaican bobsled team who made the notion of snowless countries breaking into winter sports something of a running gag that year. A new British ski-jumping record Ha ha ha. A movie about Eddie the Eagle Hee hee hee. Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman on bringing Eddie the Eagle to the big screen (CP Video) But it turns out that Eddie was all about defying expectations and Eddie the Eagle the movie is a lovely little surprise a feel-good flick with an unusual underdog story deftly told by director Dexter Fletcher a charming hero played by an unrecognizable Taron Egerton and some toe-tingling views of the perilous jumps that he conquers.In this instance - and its a heavily fictionalized version of the real Eddie Edwardss life - Eddie starts out as a sweet little boy with thick glasses a metal brace on his bum knee and a baffling determination to be an Olympian despite his obvious clumsiness.As the adult played by Egerton he is an awkward but well-meaning working-class lad always pushing his oversized glasses back onto a face that alternates between a maniacal grin when he gets an idea in his head and a quivering despondency when others point out that it wont work. He fulfills his dream of becoming a competitive skier but is cut from the British Olympic team by snotty toffs who think his bumbling persona is bad for their lofty image.And so Eddie takes up ski jumping a sport in which there are absolutely no other British contenders and travels to Europes Alpine training grounds to find himself a coach. He gets snubbed by various godlike Norwegians and Finns and by the American cowboy Bronson Peary - a wholly fictional character played by Hugh Jackman.The cynical Bronson inevitably softens and takes on the task of teaching Eddie a highly dangerous sport that most successful practitioners started in early childhood. The script written by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton rather obviously plays the naive little Brit against the big American bad boy and Bronsons side of the story - coaching Eddie makes him confront the reasons he dropped out of competitive ski jumping - feels rather forced.Jackman is much more fun when he is sneering at Eddie than when he is cheering him and the actor cant do much with the reformed character he has to play in the second half but Egerton is consistently pleasing making the lovable Eddie amusing without condescending to the character.The film occasionally uses on-screen titles to record the height of jumps or the distances Eddie needs to soar and at the end it unnecessarily flashes a quote from Olympic founder Pierre de Coubertin to the effect that the Olympics are not about winning but about participating.Unnecessarily because Egertons Eddie has made this point so clearly already and come to think of it it is a rare biopic of any kind let alone a sports bio that merely celebrates participation. Its that novelty that makes this simple comedy shine.

An IT guy maybe but not an Olympian.But thats what made the story of Eddie ""The Eagle"" so captivating in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games and thats the driving force of ""Eddie the Eagle"" which celebrates -- and perhaps oversells -- Edwards life story.Taron Egerton very suave in last years ""Kingsmen The Secret Service"" does a 180-degree turn to become the clumsy title character. Here hes all facial tics and eccentricities which is true to Edwards but distracting to the storys telling.Edwards dreams from an early age of competing in the Olympics despite his fathers -- and everyone elses -- insistence that he has no business being an athlete.That only fuels his fire and he takes on ski jumping when he realizes the lack of competition from his fellow countrymen all but guarantees him a trip to the Olympics.Eventually he comes under the tutelage of Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) a former ski jumper turned washed-up drunk who sees a piece of himself in Edwards.""Eddie the Eagle"" works overtime to peddle Edwards underdog story. In the first 10 minutes alone two characters tell him he will never succeed in sports.He never did achieve gold or even a medal but he became a fleeting media sensation which in the movies eyes is just as good.Though it aims for heroism Edwards story doesnt have a dramatic enough arc to be truly inspirational. Its not about winning its an ode to participation which isnt enough for it to get off the ground.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaEddie the EagleGRADE C+Rated PG-13 for some suggestive material partial nudity and smokingRunning time 105 minutes 28 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1QJtxuX MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/02/26/review-eddie-eagle-never-achieves-flight/80958294/,200,theeagle5,theeagle,detroitnews

More about Eddie the Eagle >> Of course he was the first Brit in about 60 years to assay the trying dangerous sport at the Olympics. His story is told in Eddie the Eagle a triumphant feel-good laugh-out-loud sports biopic. Eddie is portrayed in a star turn by Taron Egerton the versatile English actor who was comic and touching in his breakout role as Eggsy the lovable spy-in-training in Kingsman The Secret Service. Everything I just wrote about Eddie is true. He really did break a series of British records that year and he was an explosive presence in the media - reporters covering the games couldnt get enough of him. But the copy they wrote about Eddie hardly celebrated his athletic prowess Eddie jumped for distances that rarely topped 65 or 70 meters. Skiers who actually won medals that year attained nearly twice that distance. The stories beamed around the world about Eddie were human-interest pieces that talked of how the perpetually awkward working-class man-child had taken up ski-jumping only a year before the games. He was determined to become an Olympian no matter what. He already had tried his hand at various sports and eventually qualified in ski jumping because the rules hadnt been updated since the 1920s when it was easier to make the grade. Helmed by actor and director Dexter Fletcher (Hotel Babylon) Eddie the Eagle is a breezy eminently fun confection that recounts Eddies remarkably odd touching story. The films success is due in large part to Hugh Jackman (The Wolverine) who adds a touch of spice - and a bucketload of profanity - as Bronson Peary a burned-out alcoholic former ski-jumper-turned-groundskeeper so impressed by Eddies irrepressible energy and optimism he becomes his coach - and in the process redeems himself. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 Published February 26 2016 -- 301 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > HBO confirms end to Game of Thrones but spinoffs still possible Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

"Review An unlikely run at the Olympics takes flight in Eddie the Eagle - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review An unlikely run at the Olympics takes flight in Eddie the Eagle Eddie the Eagle Review Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox / Lionsgate Eddie (Taron Egerton) and his coach Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) rejoice in Eddies triumphub ""Eddie the Eagle."" Eddie (Taron Egerton) and his coach Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) rejoice in Eddies triumphub ""Eddie the Eagle."" (Larry Horricks / Twentieth Century Fox / Lionsgate) Gary Goldstein Who doesnt love an underdog sports story? Thats especially true when its one as diverting and big-hearted as ""Eddie the Eagle"" the ebullient tale of Britains wildly unlikely first-ever Winter Olympics ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards. Prepare to be amused moved and inspired.Its 1973 when we first meet Eddie (played as a boy by Tom Costello and Jack Costello as an adult by Taron Egerton) an earnest optimistic kid with thick eyeglasses ""dodgy legs"" and an Olympics obsession. In a nutshell he wants to be a contender at the Big Show whatever the sport. The problem is young Eddie has no athletic ability whatsoever something his grumpy plasterer dad (Keith Allen) bluntly reminds him. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story But Eddie is indefatigable if slightly obtuse and once his leg braces are removed -- in a joyously rendered scene -- he zeros in on downhill skiing. Years pass practice makes far from perfect and Eddie now in his early 20s is unceremoniously cut from the British Olympic ski team.Against his fathers protests but with his quietly devoted mums (Jo Hartley terrific) support Eddie makes his way to snowy Germany to tackle ski jumping. His goal is as physically illogical as it is compelling -- and frightening. On the upside Britain has no ski jumping team. So even at Eddies worst he could theoretically qualify as his nations sole competitor at the 1987 World Championships which could in turn lead the tyro athlete to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Canada. If the film wasnt loosely based on a true story youd be calling baloney at this point.Once in Germany Eddie wipes out as a prospective ski jumper. True to form he hangs in there and with the reluctant help of Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) a former ski great turned snowplow driver and bitter boozer Eddie learns to navigate his chosen sport and those sky-high takeoff ramps. Cue the jaunty pop-tuned and thoroughly fun training montages. (Jackmans sexy-limber physicality is on delightful display here.) Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Credible obstacles ensue as Eddie does in fact make his way to the Calgary Games and in his own upbeat idiosyncratic way conquers ski jumping becomes a media darling and is dubbed ""Eddie the Eagle"" after gleefully flapping his arms for the crowds. Some of Eddies many naysayers and competitors including an enigmatic young Finnish skier (Edvin Endre) eventually come around.Director Dexter Fletcher (""Sunshine on Leith"") keeps things enjoyably hurtling forward even when the otherwise engaging script by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton overworks a cliche shorthands certain practical and financial matters or proves a bit one-note as it does in its portrayal of Englands snobby disdainful Olympic committee. Meanwhile cinematographer George Richmond brings the audience into the terrifyingly fast-and-furious -- and some might say insane -- ski-jump experience with heart-pounding efficacy.Egerton is winning and utterly root-worthy as the plucky Eddie a kind of man-child in a promised land. Jackman offers a deft dose of star power as the rueful hardened Bronson a part thats both larger than life and somewhat underwritten (and it should be noted a fictional concoction). Christopher Walken feels miscast as Bronsons legendary former ski coach but the great Jim Broadbent is a hoot as an Olympic commentator.calendarlatimes.com------------Eddie the EagleMPAA rating PG-13 for some suggestive material partial nudity and smokingRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on February 26 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""An unlikely eagle takes flight anew - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Movies Entertainment Ski Jumping Hugh Jackman Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-eddie-the-eagle-review-20160226-story.html,200,theeagle8,theeagle,latimes

Credit Larry Horricks/20th Century Fox Film Corporation ""Eddie the Eagle"" is a good-natured film about the British Olympian Eddie Edwards but it would be better if it respected its audiences ability to recognize an underdog story.The film piles on the cliches and avoids anything resembling subtlety as it tells a heavily fictionalized version of Mr. Edwardss tale which culminated with his improbable appearance as a ski jumper at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary Alberta. Taron Egerton squints his way through the role of Eddie (whose eyesight was poor) and Hugh Jackman plays a fictional coach who takes him under his wing after he shows up at a training center for ski jumpers in Germany.Although Mr. Edwardss last-place finishes in Calgary made him something of a sensation a symbol of do-it-yourself persistence this film doesnt seem to trust the inherent likability of his story. The director Dexter Fletcher and the writers Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton load it up with tropes that actually make it less endearing. Video Trailer Eddie The Eagle After Eddie Edwards failed to qualify for the 1984 Olympics as a downhill skier mentor Chuck Berghorn helped him overcome several obstacles and qualify for the 1988 games as a ski jumper. By 20th CENTURY FOX PICTURES on Publish Date December 19 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Mr. Jackmans character cant be just a coach; he has to be a tired archetype a coach who was once a top athlete but flamed out and turned to alcohol. Practically everyone Eddie encounters -- other jumpers in training Britains Olympic committee his teammates in Calgary -- has to be depicted as throwing obstacles in his way so that we really really understand that hes an underdog. And so on.The film makes a winking reference to the Jamaican bobsled team whose efforts in the same Olympic Games were the subject of the 1993 hit ""Cool Runnings."" This film follows the same template as that one which should have given it license to be more restrained since the path has already been blazed. Instead it overstates everything. ""Eddie the Eagle"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some rude humor.

EntertainmentMovies High aspirations Eddie the Eagle is charming if inaccurate Originally published February 25 2016 at 300 pm Updated February 25 2016 at 1132 am Taron Egerton left and Hugh Jackman star in ""Eddie the Eagle"" loosely based on the real-life Olympic ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards. (Photo credit Larry Horricks) Movie review of ""Eddie the Eagle"" The charming if heavily fictionalized story of an unlikely Olympic ski jumper. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic If you like your biopics to be firmly grounded in historical accuracy approach ""Eddie the Eagle"" with the same caution you might feel approaching a vast icy ski-jump ramp. The film a feel-good drama has at its center an irresistible character Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards (played by Taron Egerton) a British plasterer who in his early 20s learned to ski jump though not terribly well and represented Great Britain at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. Edwards won the hearts of the crowd; he was with his Coke-bottle glasses and charmingly innocent joy the ultimate underdog. You wonder why it took so long to make a movie about this guy. (Calgary by coincidence brought the world not just a British ski jumper but a Jamaican bobsled team -- and the bobsledders got their own movie ""Cool Runnings"" a couple of decades ago.) And you wonder now that the movie is here why the filmmakers felt the need to make most of it up. Hugh Jackman co-stars as Eddies rebellious American coach Bronson Peary -- a man who never existed. The films stories of Eddie learning to jump at a European facility working with Peary and deciding dramatically at the Olympics to attempt a 90-meter jump for the first time (would that even be allowed?) are pretty much fiction. Artistic license is fine and expected -- but in this case the real story is pretty good on its own as a few minutes of research will uncover. (For example Edwards while training and broke lived for a time in a Finnish mental hospital; not as a patient but as a sort of paying boarder.) Movie Review 1/2   Eddie the Eagle with Taron Egerton Hugh Jackman Christopher Walken Keith Allen Jim Broadbent Jo Hartley. Directed by Dexter Fletcher from a screenplay by Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some suggestive material partial nudity and smoking. Several theaters. But while ""Eddie the Eagle"" feels formulaic and overstuffed with weirdly random scenes (in one Jackman appears to be imitating Meg Ryans deli scene in ""When Harry Met Sally ..."") its still a charmer. Egerton perpetually adjusting his glasses and sticking out his chin makes a forthright funny hero. (The jumping part hes got -- but ""How do you land exactly?"" he asks Peary.) By the end even though you know whats going to happen you might feel like cheering. Hes an unlikely eagle but just for a moment he flies.

PGAs distant from reality as the real Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards appeared to be when he flew into hearts and Olympic history in 1988 this modest charmer glides rather than soars. But thats good enough just like Eddie.The true story of how British plasterer Edwards overcame adversity and outfoxed Olympic brass to represent Blighty in ski-jump events at the Calgary games is certainly screen-worthy. But director Dexter Fletcher and screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton arent interested in facts.Article Continued BelowThey invent two fictional ski coaches -- Hugh Jackmans whisky-soaked ex-champ and Christopher Walkens icy patriarch -- to embellish an already slippery narrative of Edwards who is played with stoic nerd appeal by Kingsmans Taron Egerton.The real Eddie was neither this big a klutz nor this inexperienced.

Directed by John Hillcoat. Opens Feb. 26 at GTA theatres. 120 minutes. 18AJohn Hillcoat packs a binge watch of characters and incidents into this corrupt-cop thriller. The Aussie assayer of macho mettle convenes Chiwetel Ejiofor Anthony Mackie Aaron Paul Clifton Collins Jr. and Norman Reedus as Atlanta police and ex-special ops gone bad.Theyre led by Ejiofors Terrell Tompkins who in turn is bossed by Irina Vaslov (a miscast Kate Winslet) head of a ""Kosher Mafia"" demanding that Tompkins crew pull off two high-risk heists. Failure to execute means execution for these failures and denied access to the son Tompkins has with his ex-partner Elena (Gal Gadot) Vaslovs sister.All this gets boiling before the title plot stirs the planned ""999"" felling of an officer as a diversionary tactic which will mix in Casey Afflecks noble lawman and stunt-casted Woody Harrelson as his boozy detective kin.So many moving parts and not enough meshing but Triple 9 has superb atmosphere and diverse acting to spare -- and Hillcoats a slam-dunk to direct a season of True Detective.Peter HowellThe MessengerDirected by Su Rynard. 89 minutes. Opens Feb. 26 at the Carlton. GYoull never look at Torontos brightly lit downtown skyline after dark the same way after Canadian director Su Rynards doc about songbirds in peril.Illuminated towers confuse the migrating birds which fly at night to avoid predators sending them crashing into the glass. Bags and bags of the brightly hued creatures are scooped by members of The Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) from the sidewalk.Its part of Rynards global check into the dangers to some 20 billion migrating songbirds each year including noise pollution deforestation and French gourmands appetites. No wonder only about half the birds survive. Like the canary in the coal mine their health is a harbinger of human welfare.Gorgeous slow-motion footage of birds caught midflight against black backdrops is enthralling although the doc tends to flit between narratives.Linda BarnardGods of EgyptStarring Gerard Butler Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Brenton Thwaites Courtney Eaton Geoffrey Rush and Chadwick Boseman. Directed by Alex Proyas. Opens Feb. 26 at GTA theatres. 127 minutes. PGStudio Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas publicly apologized for Gods of Egypts lack of diversity although this is hardly the first Africa-set epic to use a mainly white cast.They should also fess up to CGI overkill and a dearth of originality in this ungodly jumble of a mortals-versus-deities rumble placed in the time before the pyramids were tourist attractions. Gerard Butler is amusingly evil as Set an immortal infidel who usurps Egypts throne from nephew Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in the OK opener. It all goes to hell in a chariot after that as Horus and nimble human thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) find common cause in challenging Set and chasing Beks endangered sweetie Zaya (Courtney Eaton). Cue fireballs and dust storms often.Too dull for camp and too slight for drama this time-waster unfurls under the glazed gaze of Geoffrey Rushs sun god Ra who orbits Earth in a baroque spacecraft.

It damn well better as Eddie the Eagle was built to get an audience cheering. Its the story of Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards a Brit underdog with glasses and no particular athletic talent who went on to compete at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary. Director Dexter Fletcher  shoves inspiration down your throat until you gag or give in. I held out not because the true story being told here isnt compelling but because it never feels remotely true. Thats Hollywood for you always gilding the lily. More News 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 Oscars 2016 Whos Going to Win Who Should Win All Stories >> Related 30 Best Sports Movies of All Time From Rudy to Rocky counting down the greatest films to play the game and get in the ring Heres the facts Eddie played by Taron Egerton with an unvarying expression of fixed determination grew up resisting a dad (Keith Allen) who begs him to join the family plastering business. Eddie dreams of Olympic glory. He doesnt care what sport and ends up picking ski jumping because the last British rep competed back in 1929. With no competition Eddie only needs to qualify. He does. He comes in last. But hell he made it. That sounds like enough for a movie -- just not this movie. Egerton so good in Kingsman The Secret Service plays Edwards as a neutered saint. Eddie needs a coach and finds one in Bronson Peary a former ski-jump champ now lost in the bottle. Hugh Jackman plays Peary a fictional character devised by the filmmakers to provide a redemptive father figure and trainer for Eddie. Jackman surely the most fit-looking alcoholic in the history of cinema pours on the charm especially in the scene where he mimes having sex with Bo Derek to teach Eddie the best thrusting technique to use on the slopes. If you think thats a stretch wait till you see how the movie invents hurdles for Eddie to run as if the Olympics werent enough. Take the other ski jumpers. From the nudists on the Norwegian team to the Finnish champ Matti Nykanen (Edvin Endre) Eddies competitors are all little shits eager to get him drunk and watch him fall on his face. In the script by Sean Macauley and Simon Kelton Eddie has to go it alone. Otherwise wed lose our rooting interest. Really? Would we? I doubt it but well never know. As Eddie flaps his wings and wins public adulation the deck is stacked. Ill admit that the skiing scenes in the films finale are spectacularly shot. And the stunt work deserves the gold. But as a film Eddie the Eagle is tarnished goods. The filmmakers dont trust us to understand what Eddie is feeling about the Olympics without blaring a musical message from Hall and Oates on the soundtrack ""you make my dreams come true."" Heres what is true. The reality trumps whatever his missed opportunity of a movie dreams up.

Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox Film / Larry Horricks advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The mostly true story of Englands underdog ski-jumping Olympian in 1988.CAST Taron Egerton Hugh JackmanRATED PG-13 (language and suggestive humor)LENGTH 146BOTTOM LINE Fluffy as new-fallen snow but Egerton is terrific as the unlikely Olympian and Jackman makes a fictitious character seem almost real. ""Eddie the Eagle"" is based on the life of Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards a British ski jumper who despite minimal experience and a questionable amount of talent wound up representing his country at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. This feel-good film plays loose with the facts sticks to formula and packs few if any surprises. And darned if it doesnt work like a charm. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Eddie the Eagle"" plays up its underdog angle unabashedly. In this film Eddie (Taron Egerton) isnt a diamond in the rough but a hopeless washout. Severely farsighted and uncoordinated with one leg that required a childhood brace Eddie grows up dreaming of the Olympics and crash-landing his way into adulthood -- yet he refuses to give up hope. These opening scenes go a long way toward endearing us to this odd brave resilient character. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsStoryEddie the Eagle actors talk with LI kidsStoryWhats the best Olympic-themed sports movie? In real-life Eddie was self-trained -- a remarkable fact but one that would make a monotonous movie. Screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton cleverly create a fictional trainer Bronson Peary a disgraced Olympic skier who was Eddies opposite hugely talented arrogant and undisciplined. Today Peary is the classic drunk-who-works-a-menial-job but as played by Hugh Jackman he brims with roguish charisma. Together he and Eddie force their way into the Olympics alongside well-funded competitors and European snobs. What more do you need to know? Eddies supportive mother (Jo Hartley) and dream-crushing father (Keith Allen) are worthwhile tropes as is the upper-crust British Olympic Association led by a sneering Tim McInnerny. The film suffers from a lack of romantic subplot -- why not create that too? -- but it hits every other necessary nail on the head. Directed with fittingly broad strokes by Dexter Fletcher ""Eddie the Eagle"" may or may not become another ""Billy Elliot"" but it ought to mark Egerton (""Kingsman The Secret Service"") as an actor worth watching. In this lightweight movie hes better than he even needs to be conveying Eddies social awkwardness and indomitable spirit with a squinty-eyed frown that somehow becomes heroic. Its a terrific performance that helps ""Eddie the Eagle"" take flight.

This tale of the quixotic British athlete who became the darling of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games is a tad sugary sweet but thanks to the performances of Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton the end result is a family film thats highly entertaining. Michael Eddie Edwards was an ordinary Joe -- with bottle-bottom glasses -- whose determination to become an Olympic athlete is depicted here as bordering on obsession. Edwards has to overcome a childhood handicap as well as the fears of his doting parents to compete in any sport; once he stumbles upon ski jumping as a back door to the British Olympic team he never looks back. As the adult Eddie Taron Egerton is suitably rumpled-looking and absolutely determined. He has no money or sponsorships and no equipment but he does attract all the contempt the rest of the British team can muster. Hugh Jackman enters the story as a washed-up ski jumper who sets aside skepticism and the bottle to coach Eddie; the two actors are so good in each others company that a viewer can overlook the predictability of the plot and the general manipulation of the emotions. The cast is lovely Christopher Walken pops into the story as a former coach/father figure and youll see Jo Hartley Tim McInnerny and Jim Broadbent among others. Scenes from the top of the jump are suitably terrifying. Director Dexter Fletcher gets you to fall for the determined sweet-natured Eddie then puts the lad in danger on his way to Olympic competition. The fact that Eddie might have died or been rendered quadriplegic via any of the ski jumps he undertook is no joke. Dont try this at home kids. Eddie the Eagle moves toward a celebratory finale. This is all about the indomitable human spirit and Canadian viewers get the extra fillip of seeing it come together for Eddie Edwards at Olympic Games that were held in Calgary.

With more than a dash of ""Cool Runnings"" to boot. ""Rudy"" of course was a fictionalized unapologetically sentimental undeniably inspirational story about an undersized overachieving irritatingly upbeat underdog who was doggedly determined to make the Notre Dame football team and perhaps even get into a game even though everyone from his own father to his peers to his coaches told him he was a dreamer and it would never happen. ""Eddie the Eagle"" is a fictionalized unapologetically sentimental undeniably inspirational story about an undersized overachieving irritatingly upbeat underdog who was doggedly determined to make the British Olympics as a ski jumper even though everyone from his own father to his peers to Olympic officials told him he was a dreamer and it was never going to happen. Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddies story in broad bold strokes never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but its a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story. Taron Egerton (""Kingsman The Secret Service"") gives a winning performance as one Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards an irrepressible sort with oversized glasses that never seem to quite fit on his face a mustache accurate to the 1980s setting -- and the bounce-back capabilities of one of those wobble punching bags with the weighted bottoms. RELATED Hugh Jackman Taron Egerton tour Chicago by helicopter with Roeper After failing to make the British downhill skiing team Eddie sets his sights on ski jumping even though he has zero experience in the sport and the Brits didnt even have a ski jumping team. Through a quirk in the rulebook if Eddie lands a minimum-qualifying jump in a sanctioned meet boom Hes an Olympian When Eddie does just that hes off to Germany to train for the 1988 Calgary Olympics which are just a few months away. The hierarchy of the staid British Olympic Association is mortified by the bumbling Eddie and they try to ban him from competing but its out of their hands. World-class jumpers from Finland and other countries with rich ski-jumping legacies have been doing this since they were children -- and Eddie thinks he can figure it out in a few weeks? Its practically a suicide mission. Enter Hugh Jackman as Bronson Peary (a wholly fictional creation) who could have been the greatest ski jumper of all time back in the day were it not for his selfishness and his lack of respect for the sport. Now Bronsons a hard-drinking crusty washed-up ski bum -- but wouldnt you know it he finally breaks down and agrees to coach Eddie who of course was never going to take no for an answer. Jackmans still a dashing leading man and its a bit of a stretch to buy him as broken-down has-been but he and Egerton have a warm father-son chemistry that plays well. Christopher Walken shows up out of nowhere as Bronsons former coach a legend who literally wrote the book on ski jumping. Its not clear if Walken thinks hes in a comedy or hes just having fun hamming it up but either way its a hilarious cameo. (Even Walkens face on the cover of that book produces a hearty laugh.) The final act of ""Eddie the Eagle"" is set at the Calgary Games where the unknown Eddie became an instant sensation and earned the ""Eagle"" nickname after flapping his arms about like a bird after sticking one landing. (Jim Broadbent is hilarious as a British sports announcer who is greatly amused and quite impressed by Eddies fortitude.) Nobody thought for even a second Eddie could actually compete for a medal. But Eddies brave and crazy quest to jump from 90 meters even though a fall could have caused serious injury or even death is the stuff of inspirational sports movies. Director Fletcher does a fine job of mixing stunt work CGI and close-ups and medium shots of actors sometimes showing the jumps from their point of view. We feel as if were soaring with Eddie. Some of the stuff about Eddie trying to earn the respect of his father and Bronson seeking the approval of HIS father figure goes over the top around the bend and over the top again. Still you couldnt resist ""Rudy"" and youre not going to be able to resist ""Eddie the Eagle."" These guys are champions. [s3r star=3/4] 20th Century Fox presents a film directed by Dexter Fletcher and written by Sean Macaulay. Running time 105 minutes.

Comments Eddie the Eagle Recommended Video Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2016 Based on the true story of Eddie Edwards an amateur ski jumper who defied the odds to represent Great Britain at the 1988 Winter Olympics this inspirational heart-warmer from director Dexter Fletcher (Bugsy Malone) is the cinematic equivalent of a hug. Taron Egerton plays the sweet pudgy farsighted hero; Hugh Jackman is his American coach an alcoholic former Olympian whose bristly veneer Edwards gradually softens. Fletcher produces some breathtaking jump scenes combining thrilling aerial shots with nicely blended CGI and stunt work though the heros quieter moments with his coach and even more so with his parents (Jo Hartley and Keith Allen both wonderful) are equally stirring.

Photo Larry Horricks MOVIE REVIEW Eddie the Eagle Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual innuendo). In the 1988 Calgary Olympics British ski jumper ""Eddie the Eagle"" Edwards was dubbed ""Mr. Magoo"" by the press for his thick glasses and clumsy performance -- and he loved it. A record setter by virtue of being the only Brit in his field the affable Eddie was a hit with fans. I doubt that will be the case with this version of his story a bland underdog fable whose comedy never makes it off the bunny slopes. Handsome Taron Egerton (""Kingsman The Secret Service"") uglies up to play the homely Eddie which mainly involves wearing glasses and scrunching up his face. This results in his looking a little creepily like an adult version of the kid in ""Jerry Maguire."" Eddie is a single-minded fellow who lives only to be in the Olympics despite having wonky knees and zero physical grace. No work or women or even casual conversation for Eddie who lives with his parents (Keith Allen and Jo Hartley) and comes off at times as a British Forrest Gump. He chooses ski jumping due to its nonexistent representation on the UK team and sets off to achieve his dream despite the long odds. Hugh Jackman as a (fictional) former American jumper named Bronson Peary enlivens things a little. Now a cranky alcoholic Bronsons reluctantly drawn into coaching by Eddie who faceplants in front of his snowplow rig and asks for a tip ""How do you land?"" Jackman and Egerton have reasonable comic chemistry but the film has them dutifully repeating the same paces Eddie falls Bronson grumbles; Bronson coaches while grumbling Eddie improves. Its all set to a very synthy 80s score which matches the neon ski parkas of the era nicely. Director Dexter Fletcher (""Sunshine on Leith"") also gets points for sheer weirdness with a Christopher Walken cameo; playing Bronsons former coach he seems to have wandered on from the adjoining set of a mob movie. For any kid whos been told theyre not good enough ""Eddie"" would make a fine feel-good curative. Anyone else though may find this eagle never really takes off.

USA TODAYTaron Egerton stars as the title character the British ski jumper who came in last in the 1988 Winter Olympics but caught the medias attention. Hugh Jackman plays his (fictional) coach.Eddie (Taron Egerton) and his coach Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) rejoice in Eddies triumph in ""Eddie the Eagle.""(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5The story is predictable and sentimentalEgerton and Jackman are the main draws occasionally rising above the materialWhen British ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards also known as Eddie the Eagle competed in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary there were no surprises.Eddie was expected to come in last. And he did. Resoundingly so in two events though he gained a cult following in the process.So it goes with ""Eddie the Eagle"" a film loosely inspired by (but not slavishly wedded to the facts of) Edwards story. It is an inspirational winning-isnt-everything movie about a good-natured underdog nothing more. Even if you arent familiar with his climb from the bottom to ... um the bottom you can see everything coming in director Dexter Fletchers film because youve seen this kind of thing a million times before.That doesnt mean its not without its charms the actors chief among them. Taron Egerton who made a splash in ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" plays Edwards with an abundance of awkwardness leavened by naivete his prominent underbite and oversized thick glasses dominating his face.Hugh Jackman meanwhile plays Bronson Peary a fictional American who once had promise as a ski jumper but now drives a snow plow in Germany between swigs of his hip flask. Jackmans roguish charm shines through at every opportunity. Even when hes smoking and drinking and trying to convince Edwards that hes a lunatic with a possible death wish there is no question as to whether he will come around.The film shows us Edwards as a child in leg braces but still determined to become an Olympian. His father (Keith Allen) thinks he should give up and join him as a plasterer but his mother (Jo Hartley quite good) is more supportive.Edwards has the summer games in mind but a series of comically disastrous attempts at various sports (and a box full of broken glasses for his trouble) leads to an interest in skiing. Hes not bad but certainly not Olympic material as the snobby British officials make clear.Bronson (Hugh Jackman) puts things in perspective for aspiring ski jumper Eddie (Taron Egerton). (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)But Edwards hits upon a loophole Great Britain doesnt have a ski-jumping team. Hes an Olympian by default.Not so fast. For one thing we learn that most ski jumpers start the sport when theyre 4 or 5 years old so dangerous and difficult is the sport. For another Edwards has no coach and no money. He winds up at a German training facility where the drunken disgraced Peary works. He wants nothing to do with Edwards at first but after Edwards dives right in and starts jumping Peary realizes the guy simply isnt going to quit and likely will kill himself if he doesnt get some kind of training.British officials put up more obstacles (a minimum-qualifying distance) providing some drama. But anyone who remembers the Olympics knows how things turn out.AZCENTRALEddie the Eagle (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe bigger issue -- and one that the film touches on -- is whether Edwards even as an example of never-say-die spirit really belonged at the games in the first place. In life and in the movie many openly question his presence. This was the same Olympics in which the brilliant Matti Nykanen (Edvin Endre) would win gold on both hills a feat never before accomplished. But Edwards received outsized media attention. Did he deserve it at the expense of the dedicated athletes he competed against who had devoted most of their lives to the sport?Again its no surprise which side of the question ""Eddie the Eagle"" comes down on. Its a movie as warm and fuzzy as a comfortable blanket and as safe as the milk Edwards prefers to anything stronger. Not as exciting perhaps but it gets the job done well enough.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Photo Larry Horricks/20th Century Fox McClatchy-Tribune News Service Eddie the Eagle a mostly fictional true-life tale 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Maybe its unfair but I came away feeling cheated by ""Eddie the Eagle."" Its a jolly real-life tale about an underdog who made a splash at the 1988 Winter Olympics and it does make you feel good but it turns out that the films story is 90 percent fiction. Yes there was a fellow known as Eddie the Eagle and yes he looked something like the fellow who plays him onscreen and yes he was an Olympic ski jumper -- but everything else is just made up. Should this matter? Perhaps yes perhaps no but forget about should -- it does matter because it changes the experience. The filmmakers set out to make a movie about Eddie the Eagle because he is an inspirational figure with a great story. Otherwise why rescue him from the fringes of history? And so we watch and think ""Wow. Impressive. What a guy. Wasnt that amazing?"" And then we find out that no they just took the name and a few details and changed everything else including his history as a skier his training his personal relationships and even the details of his last Olympic jump. Too bad because the reality was interesting enough. Eddie Edwards was the last man cut from Britains downhill racing team. An experienced skier he decided to train to be a ski jumper because there were no British ski jumpers and so it would be easier to qualify. His training had to be makeshift because his family lacked money to back him but he eventually traveled to Calgary where he trained with two coaches and eventually made the team. At the Olympics his exuberant spirit -- his pure joy at being there -- captured the imagination of the public and he has remained a beloved figure in Britain ever since. This version presents Eddie (Taron Egerton) as practically a novice skier and something close to a simpleton. In the movie he goes to Germany where he meets a chain-smoking down-on-his-luck drunk whose job it is to maintain the ski ramps. Turns out the drunk is none other than Bronson Peary (Never heard of him? Of course you havent. He doesnt exist but he is played by Hugh Jackman.) Bronson had a chance to be the greatest jumper of all but he squandered his natural talent through lack of discipline and character. Aha the gears are fitting together Heres Eddie no talent at all but more heart and discipline than anybody. And heres Bronson all talent and no discipline which has led years later to a life of self-abuse and self-loathing. But look the dawn is breaking and the screen is filled with light Eddie is Bronsons chance to heal himself And Bronson is Eddies chance to realize his dream What a lovely and completely fictional thing. To be sure ski jumping is a beautiful sport and a fascinating one. Just watching the movies ski jumps is enjoyable and everything about the science of jumping and the risk that jumpers take is engrossing. On several occasions the camera puts you at the top of the ramp looking down and it looks as though the jumpers are about to slide off the side of a building. Moments like that make it hard to dislike this movie -- theres no reason to try. Incidentally the real Eddie had (and has) a fairly pronounced underbite and Taron Egerton tries to re-create it without makeup. No not a good idea. All it means is that Egerton goes through the movie thrusting his jaw forward and evincing extreme mouth and jaw tension something the real Eddie does not have. Thanks to Egerton and the script this fictional Eddie is a pretty sorry fellow all right -- none too bright none too gifted and constantly doing weird things with his mouth. But we still end up rooting for him. You have to root for Eddie the Eagle. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint While it is stretching the truth to call ""Eddie the Eagle"" a good film it is without question a nice one. Its based on the true story of Michael Edwards an English plasterer who a quarter-century ago dreamed of becoming Great Britains first Olympic ski jumper. Short on athletic coordination but long on heart his ambition was a leap of faith. It made him the best -- indeed the only -- ski jump competitor in British Olympic history. His clumsy slides down the mountain-high ramp and skidding landings at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary made him his countrys beloved working class folk hero. While Eddie brought up last place he earned an A-plus for effort. His comedic biography is a lot like the man it celebrates. Genuinely likable agreeably sentimental in a root-for-the-little-guy way its like a live action cousin of the animated animal movies that bliss out children. Taron Egerton last seen as a swank young spy in ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" plays the eccentric Eddie for every available laugh. After a quick setup establishing his weak-kneed childhood attempts to leap hurdles lift weights on a bar and pole vault he decides to let gravity be his own resource pulling him down the slope to triumph. Egerton copies Eddie in his early 20s from his sloping shoulders to his nose-snorting laugh and spectacles thicker than Guinness draft. And above all the attitude that sent him to the German Alps to practice with whatever equipment jumpsuit and lodging he could afford which was not much. EDDIE THE EAGLE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some suggestive material partial nudity and smoking. Director Dexter Fletcher tries to get high-impact humor out of Eddies long-running ski slope pratfalls. The snowplow driver watching his endless crash landings is Hugh Jackman playing a fictionalized former Olympian named Bronson Peary. ""You do realize the time to start jumping is when youre 5 or 6"" he announces. While Peary left the games in disgrace long ago eternally optimistic Eddie recharges his interest. Soon the pair are deep in a training montage the sort of formulaic schmaltz the film embraces like its 1980s-style synth rock soundtrack. Jackman a solid screen presence in good and bad films alike gives the character a mix of gruff vinegar and jocular good cheer. Peary becomes in equal parts Eddies coach and a substitute dad replacing the unsupportive grouch back home. The film is repetitive to a fault as Egerton slowly meets enough Olympic regulations to enter international competition. Every woman who finds Eddie interesting -- surprising given his eye-enlarging glasses adolescent manner and attempted mustache -- is bid farewell with his entirely asexual disinterest. Egerton and Jackman arent alone in playing their cartoonish character light. Graham Fletcher-Cook as a smug British Olympic Association executive is the storys nearest thing to a genuine villain a part he camps up with snide glee. Only Christopher Walken follows a straight and narrow performing path as a U.S. official in a long conflict with Peary. Its not the friendliest performance in this relentlessly cheerful cutesy film but it is the best. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday February 25 Follow AnnHornaday Eddie (Taron Egerton) finds the right coach (Hugh Jackman) to help him fulfill his Olympic dreams in ""Eddie the Eagle."" (Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox) The 1988 Winter Olympics were the motherlode of cinematic underdog stories. Not only did the Calgary Games produce the phenom of the Jamaican bobsled team -- immortalized in the cheerful 1993 Disney movie ""Cool Runnings"" -- but a bumbling bundle of fan catnip named Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards the first British athlete to compete in the Olympic ski-jump competition and an instant symbol of innocence perseverance and irrepressible can-do-ism. Edwards is brought to quirky affectionate life by Taron Egerton in ""Eddie the Eagle"" a rousing liberally dramatized story of hard work and rewards for which the term ""heartwarming"" was apparently invented. Egerton who came to most filmgoers attention as the rough kid who becomes a suave secret agent in the comic action thriller ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" puts himself through a remarkable physical transformation to play the far-sighted Edwards contorting his youthfully handsome face into a rictus of grimaces and squints behind owlish glasses. Painfully awkward both socially and physically Edwards is nonetheless determined to compete in the Olympics a dream hes held since he was a child whose ""dodgy knees"" relegated him to a constricting leg brace. Physical setbacks arent Eddies only challenges He must pursue his Mitty-like dreams in the face of his fathers skepticism the British Olympics establishments snobbery and the condescension and hostility of a bullying bunch of skiers from Norway. But Eddie has a gift for making his own luck personified in the movie by a fictional American coach played by a smoking drinking scowling Hugh Jackman -- whose dancers grace is gratifyingly exploited during the de rigeur ""Karate Kid""-inspired training montage. That sequence is set to a bouncy Hall amp; Oates tune from the 1980s of a piece with the movies retro aesthetic that extends mod screen titles and an often intrusive synthesizer-heavy musical score. If the movie somewhat overplays the Gump-ish naivete of Edwards (he was in fact an accomplished record-holding skier when he competed in Calgary) and if its goal-conflict-triumph schematics occasionally feel threadbare and predictable the sheer likability of its indomitable hero -- and Egertons winning portrayal of him -- more than compensate for those lapses. Director Dexter Fletcher also makes the most of the breathtaking beauty and danger of ski jumping capturing moments of grace as well as catastrophic wipeouts with impressive immediacy. Like its wholesome good-natured brethren ""Miracle"" and ""Cool Runnings"" (which gets a clever shout-out) ""Eddie the Eagle"" leaves viewers buoyed by satisfactions unique to classic come-from-behind stories. Even when its as ungainly and cravenly audience-pleasing as its protagonist it soars. PG-13. At area theaters.

Share Tweet Starring Kingsman The Secret Services Taron Egerton jutting out his chin and sporting oversized glasses in a concerted attempt to appear less handsome Eddie The Eagle wears its quirkiness on its puffed sleeve. Like its protagonist the film--produced by Kick-Ass and Kingsman The Secret Service director Matthew Vaughn of all people--is cheerful and unpretentious. But unlike Eddie its not terribly original. Picture the protagonist of Napoleon Dynamite starring in Cool Runnings opposed by the preppy villains of Hot Dog... The Movie--the TV edit of course this is a family film--and youll start to get the idea.Perhaps its not the movies fault that its cliche It is based on a true story that of Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards first British Olympic ski jumper and archetypal underdog. We open with Eddie as a predictably adorable blonde moppet in a predictably poignant leg brace whose only dream in life is to make it to the Olympics. Not to win a medal necessarily just to get there. He eventually lands on the very un-British sport of downhill skiing as his best chance for Olympic glory at which point we fast-forward to 1987 where a twentysomething Eddie is attempting to qualify for the 1988 games in Calgary. Even as an adult Eddie is a wide-eyed naif a sexless innocent who drinks milk instead of alcohol snores comically loudly and isnt self-aware enough to be awkward around women (or eventually cameras).His gullible nature makes Eddie a target for his fellow British Olympic hopefuls the first of several groups of well-coiffed ski snobs that will test our slob protagonists resolve throughout the film. After being told hes not good enough to make the U.K. downhill team Eddie decides to take up ski jumping because there are no other British Olympic ski jumpers. Basically all he has to do is not kill himself in tryouts and hell make the team. (Hes sort of a one-man Jamaican bobsled team who were also at the 88 Calgary Olympics incidentally and are mentioned in the movie.) The other Olympians who resent him for making a mockery of their sport are painted as big old meanies Theyre just jealous of Eddies tenacity and naive charisma not of having their years of hard work overshadowed by a fool who managed to game the system. Theyll all come around in the end of course as will ski-jumping legend Warren Sharp (Christopher Walken) the linchpin of another feel-good character arc.See Eddies infectious determination brings hope not only to a nation of bemused TV viewers but also to his coach washed-up Olympic ski jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman). When we first meet Bronson hes a depressed alcoholic who refers to nips from his flask alternately as his ""jacket"" and ""breakfast."" Bronson resists coaching Eddie at first but eventually gets on board and becomes Eddies second-biggest cheerleader--his ever-loyal and slavishly supportive mom Janette (Jo Hartley) is the first--won over like most by his guileless charm. Will Eddies blind optimism inspire Bronson to get his life together? Will he be able to regain the approval of his ex-coach Sharp who banished him from ski jumping for his wild ways? Will they all be sipping milk by the end of the film? What do you think?This sense of comforting uplift is reflected in Eddie The Eagles visual style all kitschy decor cartoonish graphics dorky outfits in bright primary colors and warm cheerful lighting. Cutesy montages set to perky 80s hits like Hall amp; Oates ""You Make My Dreams Come True"" and Van Halens ""Jump"" support this aesthetic as does the synth soundtrack which switches to stirring strings and dramatic piano during the Olympics scenes. Aside from a couple of nauseating perspective shots looking down on dramatic Alpine vistas the setting is underutilized replaced by 80s ski-movie-style slow-motion low angle shots and faux-VHS footage. All of it should serve as ironic comfort food for people raised on 80s sports movies--a generation perhaps not coincidentally also raised on the concept of the participation medal.

Yet he instantly became a beloved folk hero for epitomizing the Games inspirational just-do-it decree. And the movie version of his life fittingly is a massive vat of hot cocoa with a mountain of whipped cream on top--sweet and warm and made with a mission to satisfy everyone who takes a sip. Taron Egerton the charmer from Kingsman The Secret Service plays Eddie with his innate charisma insulated by lots of dweeby waddling and facial twinges. The nerd posturing is oversimplistic but Egerton clicks on screen with Hugh Jackman as a former Olympian named Bronson who threw his ski tights away for dad jeans with a flask in the back pocket. Their father-son bonding provides Eddie the Eagle with two movie-affirming scenes In one Eddie is instructed by Bronson to fantasize about Bo Derek while skiing (cue Ravels Bolero) and in the other Bronson is offered absolution by his estranged off-kilter mentor (cue cameo by Christopher Walken).

Real-life Eddie Edwards was an unusual Olympic hero. An amateur ski-jumper from Cheltenham England he came in dead last at the 1988 Winter Games but won the audience over with his wacko charm. However this eager-to-please biopic of Edwards couldnt be more conventional if it tried. Director Dexter Fletcher turns every cheap trick in the book from training montages to creaky slapstick to (groan) a punch-the-air finale scored to Van Halens ""Jump."" Imagine Cool Runnings but with a pasty-faced dork standing in for the entire Jamaican bobsled team and youve got the general idea. Taron Egertons lead performance verges on bad taste playing Edwards as a squinting social outcast fuelled by a crazed obsession to ""have his moment."" The opportunity arises when he meets alcoholic ex-jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) who takes this crazy kid under his wing. Peary though is an entirely fictional creation. The film never admits it but almost everything here has been invented for the screen. That leaves a bad taste Edwards is still very much alive and his story is bizarre enough without embellishment. Eddie the Eagle may suffice for a brainless Friday night but an honest account would have been a lot more memorable.

Unfortunately Egerton is horrendous. And Jackman playing his coach isnt much better. (Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday February 24 2016 400 AM Title Eddie the Eagle Film Info With Taron Egerton Hugh Jackman. A misfit skier tries for the Olympics and its snow joke. Director Dexter Fletcher. (145). PG-13 Alcohol abuse smoking brief violence. Area theaters. Hugh Jackman doesnt play Wolverine in ""Eddie the Eagle"" which is too bad. The film deserves to be slashed to bits. More perspiring than inspiring more feel-nauseous than feel-good the overdone yet underwhelming sports story stars Taron Egerton as unique Olympic skiing sensation Eddie Edwards. And what made him really unique is that he wasnt sensational at all -- just stubborn. An average skier Eddie was nobodys first choice for Britains 1988 team. But he stuck it out and finally got his closeup and his chance to prove everyone wrong. Cue the power ballads and get out of the way. Better yet get out of the theater. Eddie (Taron Egerton) and his coach Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) rejoice in Eddies ""triumph."" (Larry Horricks/ Twentieth Century Fox) The charmless Egerton last seen as the Cockney spy in ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" plays Eddie as a squinting grinning moron. This goes on for 105 minutes. Its embarrassing but no uglier than seeing Jackman as his coach. A once-great athlete he missed his own moment of glory and now looks for forgetfulness at the bottom of a flask. Can these two poor men find redemption? Can this poor moviegoer find an exit? Bronson (Hugh Jackman) gives Eddie (Taron Egerton) some key if unconventional tips about ski jumping. (Larry Horricks/Twentieth Century Fox) The movies pretty much a mess drenched in over-the-top music that shouts at us to get excited or worried or teary. Its all in vain. Even the last-act appearance of Christopher Walken -- his hair as usual far more awake than we are -- cant add a jolt of life. Give director Dexter Fletcher this much credit though He doesnt give a ruddy toss about the American audience. This is a film wrapped in the Union Jack an act of true Brit that lovingly recreates (and largely embellishes) the life and times of a brief U.K. celebrity. Im sure itll play big among the pensioners in Blackpool. Even better it makes ""Race"" another current biopic about an athlete look a little better in comparison. And gives Jackman an incentive to keep making those Marvel movies.

USA TODAYEddie (Taron Egerton) and his coach Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) rejoice in Eddie the Eagle.(Photo Larry Horricks)Weve got Rudy. Theyve got Eddie.A British Olympic ski jumper whose heart outweighed his talent gets the biopic treatment with Eddie the Eagle ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday nationwide) a delightfully feel-good though hopelessly fluffy affair directed by Dexter Fletcher that slaloms around complete hokum thanks to a pair of winning performances.A transformed Taron Egerton trades in his good looks from Kingsman The Secret Service in favor of nerdy glasses and a dorky facade as Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards an unfamiliar folk hero for those not hardcore into international sports. From a young age he dreams of filling up a tin with gold medals instead of broken spectacles from his unfortunate ""training"" mishaps but even when he gets to be quite the downhill skier he doesnt have what it takes for the English national squad.USA TODAYSundance Hugh Jackman sneaks in Eddie the Eagle Instead of a career as a plasterer though Eddie turns his sights to the death-defying heights of ski jumping and heads to Germany to train for the 1988 Winter Olympics where the Brits had never had a competitor. (As a team of one all he had to do was reach the lowest qualifying mark to make the Games.) No one takes him seriously because hes much more ""agony of defeat"" than ""thrill of victory"" yet Eddie finds an unconventional coach in Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) a former Olympic hopeful from America whose bad-boy ways overshadowed his athletic accomplishments.Eddie does end up in Calgary and endears himself to the crowd much to the chagrin of snooty British sports officials and fellow team members who are way too cool for the likes of him. A quick Wikipedia search tells all one needs to know about how Eddie fared but like its spiritual underdog predecessor the football-centric Rudy Eddie the Eagle cares much more for its heros spirit of competition than him actually winning anything.USA TODAYSneak peek Hugh Jackman helps Eddie the Eagle soar againTherein lies its charm boosted overall by Egerton and Jackman playing against type to a degree. The younger star totally immerses himself in the hapless Eddie a character so whitebread that milk is the hardest stuff he drinks. And while Jackman is better known for wearing muscles and claws as Wolverine the Australian A-lister also plays the flawed father figure well (see the underrated Real Steel).He and Egerton have a sparkling chemistry as the movies decidedly undynamic duo on the surface -- following spill after spill Eddie finally starts getting into his groove when Bronson has him liken the act of ski jumping to bedding his crush Bo Derek. Its a scene thats a little subversive to its family-friendly mold but balances the sometimes-sugary sweetness of Sean Macaulay and Simon Keltons inspirational screenplay.Christopher Walken has an all-too-brief role as Bronsons estranged mentor a lot of Eddies ""competition"" comes off as smarmy one-note antagonists and even the good vibes are too much at times. However for those who like a certain retro style with their sports cinema a synthesizer-driven soundtrack and 80s pastiche combined with its stars gives Eddie enough flair to really fly. 27 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1XKjy83",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/23/review-eddie-the-eagle-movie/80770754/,200,theeagle28,theeagle,usatoday

It just wants to make you love it from its uplifting bromides to a training montage set to Hall and Oates ""You Make My Dreams."" As cinema its an avalanche of feel-good cliches but as an audience-pleasing machine it relentlessly pursues its goal and will probably win over viewers who surrender to it. A childhood marked by knee problems and leg braces hasnt stopped Eddie (Taron Egerton ""Kingsman The Secret Service"") from his lifelong dream of competing in the Olympics. After improvised backyard attempts at track and field training fail spectacularly - we see one pair of ruined spectacles after another get tossed into a biscuit tin - he finally decides to pursue the Winter Olympics becoming an adolescent skier of some repute. See Video Hugh Jackman Helps Eddie the Eagle Fly in First Trailer About Real-Life Ski Jumper When the posh snobs who run the British Olympic ski team conspire to keep working-class Eddie off the squad for the 1988 games in Calgary Eddie discovers - in an ""Air Bud""-worthy bit of plotting - that Britain hasnt had a ski-jumper since the 1920s and he becomes determined to make one successful landing in competition so that he can compete in Canada. This goal involves traveling to a training center in Germany where he crosses paths with a bunch of mean Scandinavians as well as hard-drinking plow driver Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) who turns out to be a former US ski champ who frittered away his early promise. Youve probably already guessed that Eddies purity of spirit can-do attitude and general gumption melts the frosty Bronson who eventually becomes Eddies coach and that hard work (and several more training montages) makes Eddies dreams come true. And who needs Olympic gold when you can finally get your fathers approval? Eddie seeks it from his own dad; Peary from former coach and paternal surrogate Warren Sharp played briefly by a somnambulant Christopher Walken. Also Read Tom Hardy Is Hugh Jackmans Pick to Take Over as Wolverine Director Dexter Fletcher (its his third feature but hes spent the last 40 years acting in film and television) and screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton never veer from formula not even to the point of pushing that formula to new boundaries. But their work in competent and Fletcher coaxes crowd-pleasing (if one-note) performances from his two leads as well as from Jo Hartley (""This Is England"") as Eddies steadfast mum. The ski footage isnt going to make anyone forget ""Downhill Racer"" but cinematographer George Richmond (""Kingsman The Secret Service"") does allow us to teeter on the edge of Eddies skis as he makes his way from the 15m jump to the 40m to the 70m to - in competition in Calgary no less - the vertiginous 90m. All of this is set to Matthew Margesons aggressively 1980s-flavored score of synth and drum machines which sounds like a collaboration between Vangelis and Tangerine Dream all stuffed into the same pair of parachute pants. See Video Hugh Jackman Shaquille ONeal Squeeze Into Phone Booths With Jimmy Fallon Peary tells Eddie about the ""jumpers paradox"" which says you have to lean into a jump in order to go further and land safely; ""Eddie the Eagle"" is designed for audiences who will throw their weight behind the films schmaltz and sentimentality. Anyone unwilling to commit to the movies shamelessness will feel like theyve hit the ground headfirst. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Blessed with pride power and an ability to affably take a lot of crap off of everybody British ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards was one of several improbable figures to emerge as folk heroes after losing badly at the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. The others of course were the four men on the Jamaican bobsled team and if director Dexter Fletchers loose adaptation of Edwards story often seems content to mimic ""Cool Runnings"" beat for beat at least it picks a bar it can safely clear. Never quite nailing the off-kilter vibe it sporadically seems to seek but functioning reasonably well as a quirkily inspirational shaggy-dog biopic ""Eddie the Eagle"" has no real chance of medaling at the box office. But its cute flourishes and gamely broad performances from Taron Egerton (as Edwards) and Hugh Jackman (as his fictional coach) could make it a sentimental success for family audiences. Recognizable by his thick glasses blonde mustache and untraditionally athletic stature Edwards responded to his elimination from Britains downhill-ski team by taking up ski jumping a sport whose last British representative competed back in 1929. Lacking any competition from his homeland Edwards not only qualified for the Calgary Olympics while still essentially a novice but also managed to attract huge amounts of publicity and ""noble failure"" fandom from his two last-place finishes much to the horror of the sports purists. Edwards story is better known in the U.K. than Stateside and though ""Eddie the Eagle"" takes rather enormous liberties with its real-life inspiration the rough outlines survive intact. In the films first reel we see the young Edwards (played as a child by Tom Costello and Jack Costello) as a lifelong Olympics obsessive forever in search of a sport to pursue. Eventually he settles on skiing to the annoyance of his working-class father (Keith Allen) who wants little Eddie to follow in the family plastering business. But when the twentysomething Edwards (Egerton) is cut from the Olympic ski team by a punctilious official (Mark Benton) hes once again forced to redirect his dreams and impulsively heads off to Garmisch-Partenkirchen Germany to try his feet at ski jumping. Twisting his torso into unusual angles and affecting a huge underbite Egerton plays Edward as such a childlike innocent -- teetotaling guileless edgeless sexless -- that he sometimes appears less a man-child than an actual child. (In one of the numerous jokey setups that the film introduces without following through with an actual punchline Edwards is propositioned by a hot-to-trot German bar owner played by Iris Berben and he responds with a mixture of terror and utter incomprehension.) Its enough to make him a bit much to take in the early going but the performance becomes far more palatable with the introduction of its opposite the grizzled Jackman as Bronson Peary a onetime ski-jump hotshot now reduced to driving a snowplow in Garmisch his hip-flask always at the ready. Initially annoyed by the hapless interloper Peary is predictably worn down by Edwards earnestness and willingness to hurl himself down the ramp without any idea what hes doing and agrees to become his unorthodox trainer. (Among his teachings a lengthy comparison of the takeoff to sex which gives Jackman a chance to go full Meg Ryan to illustrate.) Meanwhile the other ski jumpers in town especially the nudity-loving Norwegian team and the frosty Finnish superstar Matti Nykanen (Edvin Endre) shower the two with disdain. (Intriguingly the real-life Nykanen and Edwards would both go on to release Finnish-language pop songs within months of one another in the early 1990s one of several cases in which the facts of Edwards actual life prove far funnier and more surreal than any of the the fictional details cooked up by the films screenwriters.) Overlong complications ensue but by the time the film finally gets Edwards to the Olympics the pace picks up substantially. For a figure from the 1980s Edwards was a thoroughly 21st-century type of celebrity the sort of ""regular guy"" viral sensation whose popularity suggested more than a hint of condescension. At its best ""Eddie the Eagle"" also tries to grapple with Edwards position in the sport Was Eddie ultimately just a sideshow stealing the brief quadrennial spotlight from more talented athletes who spent their whole lives training for it? Or was his commitment in the face of preordained failure an example of the sort of amateur spirit that the modern games had begun to lose? The film may come down on the latter side with sledgehammer certainty but at least it briefly entertains the question. The pic gets quite a lot of mileage out of several note-perfect musical choices -- Matthew Margesons cheeky synth score could have been taken from a number of 1980s ski-ploitation pics while soundtrack appearances from Thin Lizzy and Hall amp; Oates couldnt be better employed -- and Fletcher includes just enough odd angles and quirky compositions to suggest a slightly stranger loopier vision for this film lurking somewhere beneath. The director also does effective work to emphasize the danger of Edwards jumps whether by framing the 90-meter ramp like Godzilla looming in the distance or splicing in some vertiginous first-person views from a newly airborne jumper.

Rain says February 21 2016 at 920 pm I enjoyed the movie too....also it was Bo Derek not Meg Ryan he used to illustrate take off sex Reply MarcFryd says February 21 2016 at 711 am Ive seen the movie he was very great ;D Reply Follyfoot says February 8 2016 at 1209 pm I am really looking forward to Eddie the Eagle. Dexter Fletcher has come a long way since Bugsy Malone and Long Good Friday My only concern is that Dexter is currently working with conman producer Jonathan Sothcott on a micro budget horror movie called Eat Local with Jason Flemying. Sothcott has bankrupted numerous companies and left countless actors and crew unpaid. He is an industry cancer and he takes money allocated to actors and crew so he can party with glamour models around London. Dexter knows exactly what Sothcott is like - so shame on you for working with him Reply Tom says January 30 2016 at 125 am ""In one of the numerous jokey setups that the film introduces without following through with an actual punchline..."" True comedy comes from character not from a punchline. And especially when the movie is called say Eddie The Eagle and is entirely about say a comedic character. Reply Walter Sleeth says January 29 2016 at 1052 am Looks lame. Reply therealeverton says January 29 2016 at 851 am I am looking forward to this. Reply Betty Lynn says February 25 2016 at 124 pm Me too. Was there and watched and cheered with thousands he was an inspiration for sure. A good sport.
