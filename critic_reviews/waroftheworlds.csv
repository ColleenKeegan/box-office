Comments War of the Worlds Steven Spielbergs shamelessly hokey version of the 1898 H.G. Wells yarn about murderous invaders from outer space starts off as a nimble scare show like Jaws. The special effects are good and Tom Cruise isnt bad as an alienated father fleeing with his kids. But such virtues are overtaken by a surfeit of narrow escapes and ""meaningful"" reflections about peoples behavior in war complete with allusions to 9/11 and the Holocaust. Spielbergs calculations turn out to be more prominent than any effects they could possibly produce and the less pretentious 1953 version by producer George Pal emerges as more likable. With Tim Robbins Dakota Fanning Justin Chatwin and Morgan Freeman in the offscreen James Earl Jones ""This is CNN"" role. PG-13 118 min.

Yet this update of HG Wells 1898 novel of alien attack is vintage latter-day Spielberg re-establishing the director as reigning architect of disaster porn unleashing a frenzy of the visible to metronomic rhythms of set-up and money shot set-up and money shot.Divorced bad dad Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) has his two kids for the weekend when a freak lightning storm hits his blue-collar New Jersey neighbourhood. Next an apocalypse the ground cracks and yawns open the basso-groan of alien-built tripods begins a terrifying industrial symphony and crackling beams vapourise the fleeing herds one by one their suddenly body-less clothes borne into the air like kites. (The mass-panicked humans can pose as much a threat as their predators as when a deranged zombie mob descends on the Ferriers car.) Like its charactersWaris always on the run no time to explain the alien infrastructure or the crimson kudzu-like vines choking the landscape; when a burning train screams past we pause to stare wordlessly at its smoking streak then its on to the next catastrophe. September 11 signifiers abound - in the thick film of white death-dust veiling Cruise after a narrow escape and the Red Cross volunteer megaphoning We have more blood than we can use - but any social context or family pathos (yes Ray rises to the occasion but so did the dread Giuliani) is thin and wobbly. Nevertheless the film succeeds as pure sensation an exacting distillation of fear.

"The Brutal Art of War washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Brutal Art of War Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) -- and the rest of humanity -- face an alien invasion in Steven Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds."" (Photos By Andrew Cooper At Top; And Frank Connor Above) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 1 2005 STEVEN SPIELBERG knows how to begin a movie. For the first half-hour of ""War of the Worlds"" screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepps updating of H.G. Wellss 1898 science-fiction adventure about Earth under attack by aliens I was barely able to jot down a note unwilling as I was to take my eyes off the screen. And its not as if the film is that good-looking either. Not at first. For one thing it doesnt really feel like a ""movie."" Not a big-budget one starring Tom Cruise anyway. Theres a smallness to it an offhand quality in the way it introduces us to its central characters New Jersey crane operator Ray Ferrier (Cruise) a divorced screw-up who has agreed to take his kids Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) for the weekend while his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) goes out of town. Ray is late for the handoff; Mary Ann is angry but used to being let down; the kids are sullen and hungry; and theres no food in the house. Soon however the domestic-melodrama quality of the story gives way to a much different yet no less verite style of filmmaking as Ray Rachel and Robbies lives are turned at times quite literally upside down. Thats when the aliens arrive. Rearing up without warning from beneath the streets of small-town Jersey which buckle and break like sugar cookies the first of the mysterious exterminating machines (or tripods as they are quickly dubbed) is a sight to behold. And you cant even see it that clearly what with the dust and smoke and shaky-camera pandemonium swirling all around it. All of which makes it that much more terrifying. What is it? And what does it want? Thirty minutes in Spielbergs film feels and looks like a documentary about something too awful and too new to even define. Of course what it wants is simple. This soon becomes very very clear along with the fact that it isnt an ""it"" but a ""them"" as Ray and the kids race -- in a stolen car at first and then later on foot after a harrowing encounter with a crazed and homicidal mob leaves them without wheels -- past dozens of these merciless machines from outer space. ""Its not a war any more than theres a war between men and maggots"" says Ogilvy (Tim Robbins). Hes the slightly -- okay seriously -- nutty guy with a gun and a root cellar who offers refuge to our heroes at the films halfway point. By now Robbie has gone missing and Ray and Rachel quickly start to wonder whether they wouldnt have been safer taking their chances outside than agreeing to hole up in a basement with a fruitcake who fancies himself a member of the ""resistance."" Its during this sequence that Cruise does some of his best acting. And it comes not when Ray is forced to make a necessary but morally bad decision regarding Ogilvy but when Rachel asks him to sing her to sleep and he realizes with crushing disappointment that he doesnt know any lullabies. This is when it becomes clearest that despite all the special effects and spectacle -- and ""War"" does become spectacular as the story progresses -- the movie is at heart a tale of a fathers love. That keeps it grounded and credible even at its most epic moments. I wrote at the top of this review that I was scarcely able to take any notes during the films initial adrenaline blast. Thats true but that doesnt mean that ""War of the Worlds"" is flawless. From time to time I was bugged by certain inexplicable but cinematically convenient holes in logic the digital camera and camcorder for instance that appear to be working fine despite the electromagnetic pulse that has disabled all other electronic devices and the fact that Rays stolen car miraculously emerges completely unscathed from the crash of a jetliner that destroys the house it was parked in front of. Oh and then theres the scene where we first meet the aliens close up. Tell me if it doesnt remind you a little too much of the scene in ""Jurassic Park"" in which the velociraptors are stalking the kid hiding in the kitchen. One last thing. As is his wont Spielberg cant resist stuffing the ending of the movie with a bit too much cheese and baloney at least for my taste. I suspect though that as with ""Saving Private Ryan"" I will be in the minority in that regard. Despite those quibbles ""War of the Worlds"" is taut gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking. It earns its not-to-be-underestimated frights the hard way and not merely by boogeymen who jump out of the closet. Like its blue-collar hero it works for a living.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - --H.G. Wells The War of the WorldsSo far this summer at the movies it has been possible to watch the world end (or at least descend into chaos) in a number of familiar ways -- via the machinations of a corrupt despot (in Revenge of the Sith) the ideological maxims of an Eastern villain hell-bent on chemical warfare (in Batman Begins) or (in Land of the Dead) the isolationist tendencies of a greedy autocrat who earns the ire of the flesh-eating masses. Taken together these movies have suggested a burgeoning consciousness in an ostensibly mindless genre reminiscent of the communist paranoia that famously worked its way into such 1950s B pictures as Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing From Another World. Suddenly and with increasing frequency those of us accustomed to consuming cinematic death and destruction as though it were popcorn have found ourselves choking on some not-so-small sociopolitical bones. If Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds at first seems a reprieve such comfort is fleeting. Which is no doubt just as H.G. Wells would have wanted it. Published in the waning days of the 19th century his The War of the Worlds was a troubled reaction to an England Wells saw as fatally lagging behind its fellow first-world nations in the tide of global progress. (As late as 1895 electricity and indoor plumbing were still viewed as luxuries even by many supposedly industrialized Londoners.) With its vision of technologically advanced Martians momentarily gaining the upper hand on mankind the novel was intended as an allegorical wake-up call for Wells countrymen -- though even the author himself may have been disturbed at how presciently his narrative anticipated the next centurys campaigns of totalitarian terror.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Thats more or less where Spielberg steps in. For his War (which was co-scripted by Josh Friedman and David Koepp) is less a glance into a possible future or even a reaction to the times in which we live than it is a plangent contemplation of the times in which we have been living for the last 100-odd years. From the moment of the films first alien attack -- and the panic-stricken daughter (Dakota Fanning) of the movies stevedore protagonist (Tom Cruise) screaming ""Is that the terrorists?"" -- War of the Worlds announces itself as a reverse inventory of 20th- and 21st-century atrocities beginning with 9/11 (blinding clouds of debris filling the streets of New York and airplanes falling from the sky) and winding its way back through the L.A. riots (a truly terrifying scene in which Cruise is pulled from his car and beaten by an enraged mob) the corpse-strewn rivers of Rwanda the battlefields and deportation trains of WWII and even (in a perilous drawbridge scene) the sinking of the Titanic with its eternal reminder of mans hubristic folly. And so it is that the movies aliens -- whose origin is never identified and who rarely appear apart from their giant stalking tripod vehicles -- are presented not as a specific threat but as the abstract manifestation of all that shatters our notion of ourselves as all-powerful beings. The imagery is startling not just for its symbolic resonances but for the breathless intensity with which it sears the screen. As with most of Spielbergs recent films War was produced incredibly quickly for a movie of its scale (filming only began last November) and that frantic energy invades every frame of the finished picture. Like its own characters -- particularly Cruises Ray who spends most of the film in amped-up Jerry Maguire/Magnolia/Oprah mode -- this is a movie on the run for its life. Spielbergs camerawork with the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is fast and loose and the muddied earthen palette lends an unusually tactile quality to the elaborate digital effects. Theres also despite the movies generally grave tone a discernible pleasure in the way that Spielberg after years of filling our dreams with visions of benevolent interstellar visitors now takes to stocking our nightmares instead. A city street cracks and buckles like too-thin ice. Disembodied shirts and pants drift through the air parted from their recently vaporized owners. And as the aliens devour their human prey bright-red blood sprays out in all directions like some vampiric sprinkler system. As he ably demonstrated in E.T. Spielberg -- who has often (and not always undeservedly) been fingered as a sentimentalist -- can be as honest and unsentimental an observer of broken-down families as any we have in American movies. His own parents divorced when he was 16 and that residual pain informs Wars terse relationship between Ray a borderline deadbeat and his brooding teenage son Robbie (the very good newcomer Justin Chatwin). Over the course of the films apocalyptic tumult Ray becomes fortified in his resolve to hold his family together after everything else around him is obliterated. In the hands of a less knowing and confident filmmaker -- one too eager to lift the audiences spirits -- that might have been the entree to a tidy resolution in which Ray and his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) decide to give things another go. But in Wells own spirit Spielberg remains skeptical of too-happy endings. In the movies final shot the heroic Ray like The Searchers Ethan Edwards stands at literal and figurative remove from a welcoming home front palpably wary of the ease with which we return to normality and routine in the wake of great disaster. As well he should be. WAR OF THE WORLDS | Directed by STEVEN SPIELBERG | Written by JOSH FRIEDMAN and DAVID KOEPP based on the novel by H.G.

"War of the Worlds | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; war-of-the-worlds ) War of the Worlds (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres a longstanding movie riddle that asks the following question Is it better to have a mediocre director and a great screenplay or a great director and a mediocre screenplay? War of the Worlds Steven Spielbergs entry into the 2005 summer box office derby can be used as an argument for the latter scenario. To call the script (credited to Josh Friedman and David Koepp) ""flawed"" might be charitable. The original novel penned in 1898 by H.G. Wells seems almost quant by todays standards. Although the changes employed by Friedman and Koepp to modernize the story are adequate in displacing many of the books events to a contemporary time frame they result in a tale that is rife with logical errors. War of the Worlds is not watertight; in fact it leaks like a sieve. But with Spielberg at the helm we hardly notice the chop in the water as were taken on a smooth and somewhat breathless ride. It used to be that when Spielberg looked to the sky he saw hope the friendly brightly colored lights of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the harmonious message of E.T. This time however the director has looked through the glass darkly. He takes the kind of menace previously found in the terrestrial-based monsters of Jaws and Jurassic Park and applies it to life amongst the stars. These fiends from another planet which are closer cousins to the creatures from Alien than those from E.T. arent out to make contact or colonize; their goal is extermination. Friedman and Koepp have time-shifted Wells story ahead by a little more than a century and re-located it (as a nod to the infamous 1938 radio broadcast) to New Jersey. This is a post-9/11 world (a fact that is emphasized by a brief pan of the World Trade Center-less Manhattan skyline) where the pall of terrorism hangs like a poisonous cloud over humanitys dealings with one another. Suddenly all of that is about to become irrelevant. Man is on the brink of becoming a hunted species with petty differences turning insignificant as survival instincts take over. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is an average blue-collar worker living in a cluttered house with a job that probably allows him to barely meet his mortgage payments. He rushes home from work one morning to greet his kids - 10-year old Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and her 16-year old brother Robbie (Justin Chatwin) - who are being dropped off by his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) for a weekend visit. Ray doesnt have the best relationship with his offspring and his deficiencies as a father are immediately apparent. But this isnt a normal day. Before it has ended bizarre lightning storms have caused gigantic alien tripods to explode from beneath the ground and entire towns are being leveled. Ray grabs his kids and takes them on a frantic roadtrip to find their mother. But in a world where nothing can stop the mechanical monsters and humans are turning on humans for basic necessities where can safety be found? War of the Worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen (although when considering movies such as the like-themed Independence Day its far from the dumbest) but it is an intense visceral experience. The feeling is very Jurassic Park-like with outclassed humans fleeing for their lives from unstoppable behemoths. The roar of the tripods when sent blaring through theater speakers is genuinely scary and John Williams disharmonious score emphasizes dread. This is as ""hard"" as a PG-13 rating gets. The only thing that saves War of the Worlds from earning an R is that many of the on-screen deaths are the result of vaporization rather than something more gruesome. For the majority of the films nearly two-hour running length Spielberg propels us from one ""out of the frying pan into the fire"" situation to another. The film is as relentless as its villains only occasionally allowing us to catch our breaths before once again elevating the level of suspense. Along the way War of the Worlds finds time for a little social commentary - how dire circumstances can bring out both the base and elevated aspects of human nature. We see the mob mentality and instances of selfless bravery. And much later we understand the extent to which a father will go to protect his daughter. Spielberg has populated his film with vivid images. The mass destruction one expects from a movie of this sort doesnt leave much of an impact - we have seen houses bridges and roadways blasted into rubble before. But the simpler scenes - such as a mass of dead bodies floating downstream on a quiet river - become lodged in the memory. Of all the striking moments to appear on the screen that one affected me the most deeply as the serenity of the moment is slowly transformed to horror. The ending is weak with everything being resolved in a few minutes. Although to be fair the aliens (they are not ""Martians"" in this movie) are felled in the same manner as in the book and Spielberg probably does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic. But those expecting the heroism of films like Independence Day and Armageddon wont find it here. In fact War of the Worlds is a misnomer. This isnt war its slaughter. Its about fighting to survive not fighting the enemy. Tom Cruise is fine as Ray and he effectively brings his character along the arc from callous self-centered absentee-father to caring parent. Since the emotional core of War of the Worlds centers on the relationship between Ray Rachel and Robbie this is a key performance. Dakota Fanning is effective looking terrified and shrieking although thats about all she is allowed to do. Rachels limitations are more a function of the material than Fannings acting. Robbie is annoying (one could argue that hes a typical moody teenager but the irritating aspects of his personality could have been toned down) but Justin Chatwin probably cant be faulted for that. The only other actors with significant screen time are a pregnant Miranda Otto and Tim Robbins as a slightly unhinged survivalist. Morgan Freeman provides opening and closing narration although he never appears. War of the Worlds ends up being part-disaster film and part-monster movie and theres more horror than science fiction. The kinship to the brasher rah-rah Independence Day is obvious but theres also a little Godzilla (the Japanese one not the American one) to be found here. And there are times of simmering tension such as the lengthy sequence in which an alien ""eyestalk"" searches out survivors. (This recalls the spider search scene in Minority Report.) Also by keeping the movie essentially first-person with the camera remaining with the Tom Cruise character Spielberg enhances the immediacy and personal nature of the struggle. Showing cities around the globe being destroyed might have been more spectacular but it would have undermined the directors intention to follow this family unit. War of the Worlds is not vintage Spielberg and its on the grim side for a summer action blockbuster but its worth the time and money invested.

Starring Tom Cruise Dakota Fanning Tim Robbins and Miranda Otto. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to imagine a better movie called ""War of the Worlds"" than this latest from Steven Spielberg. It is simply the alienation-invasion movie to beat all alien-invasion movies meticulously detailed and expertly paced and photographed with sights so spectacular and terrible that viewers will have to consciously remind themselves to close their mouths when their jaws drop open. Did you ever go to the movies when you were 10 or 11 sit close to the screen and hardly believe the amazing things you were seeing? ""War of the Worlds"" brings back that feeling. This is escapist entertainment of a high order from John Williams neoclassical score to the near-miracles wrought in special effects. Yet the escapism is grounded in a fairly sophisticated understanding of specifically modern fears. The scenes of urban destruction -- chaos in the streets collapse in communications -- intentionally call to mind everyones worst terrorism nightmares. Fifty-two years ago when director Byron Haskins acclaimed ""War of the Worlds"" was released nuclear annihilation was the big fear but the H.G. Wells classic could not quite be shaped to evoke that anxiety. The terrorism connection however is made plain almost from the beginning of the new film when Tom Cruise -- as Ray a divorced father of two -- has his first alien encounter. He comes home covered in fine white dust like a bystander at ground zero. The white powder in this case is pulverized flesh and blood the result of an alien death ray which apparently annihilates living cells but leaves clothing intact. People explode into nothing as their clothes go flying. Its a startling effect and a horrible sight but not only horrible -- horrible is easy. Its eerie as well. Its also in a way insulting in that it violates our sense of a human beings importance. This is what makes Spielberg so good The spectacle of those bodies instantly vaporizing is horrible eerie and insulting not just in the eyes of the audience but in the eyes of the panicked people as theyre running for their lives. Though grand in scale ""War of the Worlds"" does not feature generic monster-movie-style fleeing. The bit players and extras as well as the principals are at all times thinking and reacting in specific and human ways. Thus the spectacle is rendered not poignant exactly (it all happens too fast to be poignant) but always personal. Easily ""War of the Worlds"" could have been a crude movie. Instead its graceful. How does Ray find out something is amiss in his world? He walks out his door and sees a crowd of people taking photos of something above his house. He looks up and sees the sky swirling and flashing light. The details make the movie The wind blows in the wrong direction. Theres lightning without thunder. A father and daughter cower under the kitchen table -- the father fearing that he cant protect his kids and the daughter reading that fear and beginning to panic. Of course the movie gets the big stuff right. The early scene in which people on the street find the ground breaking up beneath them sets the standard for the whole picture. A brick church slowly splits in half in what must be a blue-screen effect but it sure doesnt look like one. It looks like being there. Yet you could find that kind of thing in a good Roland Emmerich movie. What you wont get from a lesser filmmaker are the little imaginative embellishments the aftermath of devastation with bits of clothes from the pulverized bodies floating to the ground. Or the passenger train every car on fire roaring through a small town on the way to nowhere. Or the cords and clots of gore covering acres of empty fields. Tim Robbins makes a brief but vivid appearance as a bug-eyed maniac the role usually played by Randy Quaid. Justin Chatwin as Rays rebellious teenage son does what he needs to do but little more as hes blown off the screen by Dakota Fanning as Rays 10-year-old daughter. Fanning is a little marvel a strong child actress whos self-possessed without seeming snotty. Her face suggests a mature consciousness. From some angles she looks about 45. Cruise does not have his best moments as an actor in ""War of the Worlds."" His introspective scenes in which he tries to process the horrors he has witnessed are not convincing. Fortunately this is not an introspective role. Its a role that calls for a face that stands out in the crowd a body thats capable and an energy that says ""Lets do something."" Max von Sydow is a superior actor but I couldnt care less what he would do in an alien invasion. For an alien invasion I want Cruise. As for Spielberg consider this film a public recanting of all that sentimental ""E.T."" nonsense about space aliens being cuddly. Consider it also evidence that this director who was already special when he was doing TV movies more than 30 years ago keeps getting better. -- Advisory This film contains gruesome space aliens and violence.

Young daughter (Dakota Fanning) and son arrive for a weekend visit with their divorced dad (Tom Cruise). Then along come aliens. Paramount Pictures Director Steven Spielbergs summer blockbuster has knockout special effects masterful cinematography and terrifying and suspenseful sequences. Above all it is relentless. Its explosive non-stop action brings to mind Saving Private Ryans indelible opening battle sequence. But expect a logical plot and youll walk out of the theater with a host of questions mostly concerning procedural points of the alien attack. The story adapted from H.G. Wells 1898 classic stars Cruise as a divorced dad who has been derelict in his paternal duties. When his kids visit Dad makes feeble attempts to connect with his daughter (Dakota Fanning) and son (Justin Chatwin). Were supposed to believe by the movies end that Cruises character a cocky dockworker has become a good parent protecting his kids during the alien invasion. But the transformation doesnt quite happen. We see his will to survive and some softening around the edges but mostly he seems exhausted by the ordeal. Cruise was better in Minority Report his last collaboration with Spielberg. Though hes playing a working-class guy we never forget were watching Cruise the movie star. Perhaps his TV appearances in recent weeks and the media attention on his romance with Katie Holmes have interfered with his credibility as an Everyman. The best performance is by the youngest cast member Fanning whose haunting gaze and emotionally intelligent portrayal convey her characters sense of trauma. She brings to mind the preternaturally wise performances of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense and A.I. and the wide-eyed innocence of Drew Barrymore in Spielbergs E.T. Clearly Spielberg has a knack for directing children. But the real stars of the movie are the special effects and the havoc wreaked by the aliens gargantuan tripod machines. The massive human ""extermination"" is one of the movies most vicious and prolonged visions of wholesale massacre. With tremendously long tentacles the machines split buildings in half upend cars crash planes destroy cities and vaporize humans. The voice-over is provided by Morgan Freeman whose superb narration is a highlight of the documentary March of the Penguins. But his commanding delivery is not enough to move us here mostly because his script is too pat and showcases the holes in the story. Nevertheless when it comes to searing and iconic visual imagery Spielberg is still the best filmmaker around. Aided by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and visual-effects supervisor Dennis Muren he uses light and color in stunning and dramatic ways. With the exception of the disappointing scenes showing the actual aliens (who look like troll dolls which makes them none too menacing) the effects are never standard issue. Its fitting that the man who scared us silly three decades ago with Jaws has taken such ubiquitous movie visuals as car crashes alien attacks and fiery explosions and made them riveting and horrifying. (PG-13 for frightening sequences of sci-fi violence and disturbing images. Running time 1 hour 55 minutes. Opens today nationwide.)

"The Great War washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies The Great War Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 29 2005 Steven Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" is a close encounter of the blurred kind an orchestration of chaos and panic and destruction as visceral as it can get. Despite occasional flaws and misjudgments its a brilliantly told tale. It really rips along; it seizes you in its first seconds holds you spellbound for two short hours and expels you breathless and spent. Its your best summertime movie rush in many years. The story from H.G. Wellss turn-of-the-20th-century novel is classic inter-space paranoia about the Them from up there who attack the Us from down here. Cities fall armies are defeated millions perish civilization teeters. Its all familiar whether first experienced in 1938 when Orson Welles distilled it into ersatz news reports on nationwide radio and caused a panic; in 1953 when George Pals big-budget version terrified a baby-boom generation just out of its diapers; or in 1996 when you had green hair and pins in your lips and it was called ""Independence Day."" But Spielbergs telling is completely fresh. What one notices instantly is the absence of that 50s voice of military or scientific authority. In all the previous iterations of this story and its many derivatives the hero was either a scientist (Gene Barry in Pals variant) or a professional soldier (Ken Tobey in Howard Hawkss ""The Thing"" the same story told on a smaller scale in 1951). Those conventions made perfect sense back then Our government victorious in war facing a new Red challenge (the metaphorical undertone of the alien-invasion genre) was seen as benign benevolent and efficient able ultimately to deal with the enemy. This made perfect sense even in ""Independence Day"" which was a kind of retro-cornball piece of kitsch. Perhaps now it doesnt when terrorists can take out a big chunk of the Manhattan skyline and detonate IEDs on Baghdad roadways seemingly at will. Our general apprehension might be summed up in the phrase ""out of control"" and Spielberg capitalizes on that fear giving us an out-of-control world as viewed from the ground. Hes not much interested here in larger entities like The Government or Science; he focuses instead on working man Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his two kids Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (the great Dakota Fanning) and dramatizes how the Ferrier family just barely copes with the coming of the things from another world. We only glimpse soldiers and one (brilliant) sequence shows them using Arabian desert tactics against the three-legged Martian fighting machines and perishing in a wall of fire for their impertinence. The government the message runs is powerless. That makes the movie far more intense by the way. One has the sense of panic everywhere One of the visual signatures of the film is the process of scattering as mobs facing impending destruction break apart and its every man or family for him or itself with no place to hide and no place to go. The film chronicles a journey as Ray takes his two kids from ruined New York to equally ruined Boston across a landscape of ruin. Spielberg working from a script by Josh Friedman and David Koepp establishes Ray as one of those child-men in whom adult responsibility never quite took root. Cruise is superb as a loose-cannon type closer to his fellow workers than to his kids. You think ex-high school jock a little too cocky for his own good completely ungrounded. Rebuilding an engine in the living room seems a perfect expression of his lack of propriety or responsibility. We watch him take charge of his kids for the weekend -- hes divorced -- and of course hes late his house is a mess he has no plans and his kids both see through him. Spielberg has a special feel for family dynamics as viewers of his more benign alien-contact films ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will remember. But this is a more hostile family. Cruise hasnt the warmth as an actor that Richard Dreyfuss brought to ""Third Kind"" being a tenser vainer more frightened personality; and the overall tone of the movie is far far edgier than that exercise in basic goodness. ""War"" is an exercise in basic badness. New wrinkle No. 2 How they get here. Hmmm seems they were already here. If I understand it correctly the machines have been buried for a million years. Thats how long the vast cool unsympathetic intellects of the Red Planet have been planning their D-Day. (We take on faith a Martian origin though the movie never specifies such.) What arrives to Earth arent ships but energy storms -- Spielberg has always loved clouds and now he fills them with jagged lightning strikes like saber strokes -- whose bolts charge what lies beneath. As storytelling this is ingenious It precludes the space-invasion ritual the slow approach of the townies to the new-fallen comet the unscrewing of its cap the emergence of an ambiguous tentacle or metal appendage the approach of the peaceniks and the sudden savagery of the melting ray. Instead with brilliant (but understated) special effects Spielberg breaks the mold by having his foes arrive from beneath rising from the surface like breaching whales (indeed the control node of the Martian fighting machines resembles Moby Dicks eye more than anything a kind of cold malevolent glare at the soon-to-be destroyed). Setting such carnage in teeming urban northern New Jersey across from Manhattan instead of Smallville U.S.A. is another brilliant stroke. It makes the fight a fight for civilization (the city) from the start -- and Spielberg doesnt waste time. Twenty minutes into the film and Earths foundations have fled. The movie stays entirely with the Ferriers. They make it out to the burbs when Ray manages to commandeer one of the few working vehicles -- most have been disabled by electromagnetic pulse -- and spend an eventful night in his ex-wifes house. Then its up to Boston encountering roads jammed with other refugees who are going there simply because they cant stay here as well as a few Army units desperately fighting by the tactics of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The subtext to all this neatly enough is what might be called warriorhood. The movie is really about fighting -- not getting along. It pushes the idea subtly that Spielberg also pushed in ""Private Ryan"" one that he might not express publicly the value the necessity of warriors. Ray is growing up under the pressure going from feckless to furious. At the same time he cannot quite earn the respect of his son (Chatwin is very good as the intense Robbie) who being younger and more full of testosterone yearns to fight the creatures and seems to throw himself into a wall of flame in pursuit of that destiny. The movie follows that line through to the end though it falters when it momentarily diverts into a one-act play. Ray and Rachel take refuge in a farmhouse basement where they encounter Tim Robbins the films only other recognizable actor. This seems like a weird bid to get Robbins an Oscar; he takes over the film filling it with paranoia irrationality and overacting. What has seemed expansive is suddenly turned claustrophobic. I understand the appeal of the idea The movie has until then lacked any kind of intimacy and Spielberg may have felt impelled to give us a little emotional reality. As well he needed to show Rays commitment to the idea of father as warrior Now Ray has to take violent action to save his daughter. But the sequence left an unpleasant taste in my mouth and could have been left on the cutting-room floor. Still ""War of the Worlds"" will pretty much rise or fall on its spectacle which means it should rise. Spielberg has always been a glib stager of action finding ways to represent old sequences in completely fresh ways as witness the extraordinary agility he brought to routine combat action in ""Private Ryan."" Thats on display in this film too where the audience is treated to one extraordinary vision after another; the sense of a world literally being destroyed around the principal actors the sense of their flight through panic and destruction the sense of concussion collapse rubble and ruin. All these are incredibly powerful but theyre not generalized because you experience them through the Ferriers. When you leave the theater youll check for dust in your hair and on your clothes. But theres also an intellectual coherence to the film. What seems to hold it together is the concentration on blood. This extends from the initial idea of Mars as the ""Red Planet"" to the blood ties between Ray and his kids that turn out to be what gives them strength. It turns out further that the invaders have come to Earth for specifically blood; they are vampires who need our plasma to live. When they are done with their prey they leave a blood residue and in one scene a red landscape is seen stretching to horizon as if all humanity had been rendered. Spielberg is only marginally interested in what eventually overcomes the invaders. He cares more about human adhesion the stuff that binds us together and that it seems makes us human to begin with unlike the cold distant intellects of Mars. The idea seems to be That was something they couldnt relate to and in the end that as much as anything dooms them. Our blood was thicker than theirs. War of the Worlds (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 but its intense scenes of death and destruction should give adults pause before taking children.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED June 27 2005 at 431 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 942 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post When Tom Cruises Ray Ferrier finally takes a breather from running for his and his two kids lives he has a moment of reflection. So does director Steven Spielberg. We see the former dockworker and divorced dad mirrored on the surface of a window in the kitchen of his ex-wifes empty suburban home. Early in the movie his pregnant ex and her husband dropped teen son Robbie and tween daughter Rachel off at Rays cluttered place in a New Jersey town. Now a slice of bread smeared with peanut butter is stuck to that window. Ray threw it and hes looking out into the night. In Spielbergs orchestrally conducted ""War of the Worlds"" its not the sight of aliens that scares quite so much. Not that the image of tentacled tripods towering above the New Jersey countryside and methodically sweeping the land clear of humans isnt chilling maybe even thrilling in the way genre scares can be. Spielberg his longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski and special-effects maestro Dennis Muren outdo much that has come before with the initial attack on a Jersey town. What stays with us from this bravura spectacle (a good-faith adaptation of H.G. Wells 1898 novel) is the look - and often the sound - of fear itself. It comes in the grimace the blank stare the stunned terror and the resolve that registers on Rays face as he struggles to fathom the impossible. For all its jaw-dropping effects ""War of the Worlds"" is about the limits of parental knowledge and the lengths to which a parent may go to protect a child. When Ray scuttles under a table beside Rachel - shaken by a booming electrical storm - you realize what can be more frightening to a kid than an utterly scared parent? This is Wells politically resonant sci-fi classic revisited as a Spielbergian parable about family. Which doesnt mean it lacks its own historical awareness. Crowds of refugees the fluttering posters of the missing the strewn remnants of a jumbo jet the utter astonishment delivered by surprise attack - all suggest ""War of the Worlds"" knows precisely which planet it has landed on. When Ray arrives late for the divorced parents drop-off we learn pretty quickly that the Mustang-gunning dad isnt as mature as his ex wants him to be or his kids need him to be. Teenager Robbie (Justin Chatwin) is all muted belligerence. Youngster Rachel (Dakota Fanning) handles Rays immaturity by fending for herself. Early in the mayhem Spielberg and writers David Koepp and Josh Friedman do a fine job of stripping away Rachels mask of maturity. Duress reveals the kid in her as much as it may locate a father of substance in Ray. All of 11 years old Dakota Fanning is already such a pro that it helps here that she plays a precocious kid. When she yells ""Is it the terrorists?"" its the spot-on mix of kid-gleaned knowledge with a childs aching vulnerability. ""Terrorist"" might as well be ""boogeyman"" shes so freaked. Cruises and Fannings characters make up the pounding heart of the film. This father doesnt know best. Sometimes he doesnt even seem to know anything. But he learns. On a hillside where the National Guard is trying to hold fast against the onslaught Ray and Robbie wage their second battle of wills about Robbies wish to spontaneously enlist. Will Ray let him? Will he be able to prevent him? What does it mean to let a child go to war? When Ray and Rachel stumble from that hillside they are given shelter by Ogilvy (Tim Robbins). A compression of two of Wells characters Ogilvy has plenty of theories about the aliens and some survival skills but hes a bit off too. What happens in that cellar between Ray and Ogilvy is enough to keep an ethics class yammering for weeks. Spielberg and Cruise both have a chuckle that these malevolent visitors arent your fathers E.T. or even yours. The director understands that big-movie storytelling can - must - spin yarns that resonate with meaning. In the publicity buildup to ""War of the Worlds"" it was sort of amusing that Spielberg and Co. dumped the first article in Wells original title. Press e-mails came with the abbreviation ""WOW"" on them. Wow indeed. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Tom Cruise Steven Spielberg Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- H.G. Wells alien invasion story ""The War of the Worlds"" first published in 1898 is a looking glass for the fears of the times.When he wrote it Wells -- like many observers -- was uneasy about industrialization. In 1938 Orson Welles re-enacted the story on the radio at a time when Hitlers war machine was gearing up in Europe. In 1953 when the Cold War was at its height a successful movie starring Gene Barry was produced.Now Steven Spielberg has brilliantly resurrected ""War"" in the aftermath of September 11 with terrorism on many minds. Its no coincidence that the movie begins in present-day New York City.The alien invasion is seen through the eyes of one man Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) and his two children Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin).The film starts heavy-handedly. Divorced from his wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) Ray -- as the script makes clear again and again -- is an inept indifferent father. When his children reluctantly appear for a rare visitation to his messy bachelor pad in working-class New Jersey were repeatedly shown that they dont particularly like him and he has no idea of how to relate to them.But things pick up considerably when a gigantic and strange lightning storm blackens the sky. In small effective vignettes Spielberg captures the awe and ensuing panic of Rays family and neighbors as the storm clears and huge alien tripods -- triggered by the lightning -- begin to rise up from beneath the citys streets.The tripods immediately begin to vaporize buildings and people at random. Soon Ray -- in a gruesome nod to 9/11 -- is covered in ashes from the debris of human remains as he and his children flee the city.Strong performancesUnlike other sci-fi movies involving the planets destruction ""War of the Worlds"" contains no major landmarks blown to smithereens no urgent messages from the Oval Office and no scenes of frantic TV reporters doing dramatic live shots while surrounded by the terrified public.Spielberg doesnt need the cliches. Instead he adheres to the suspenseful story of an ordinary man caught up in an extraordinary event -- albeit with two kids attached. (Children werent a part of the original version.)Fanning once again gives an amazing performance showing a maturity way beyond her years. Her character along with Cruises is in nearly every scene and shes vital to Rays eventual redemption as both a man and a father. Cruise copes with panic in ""War of the Worlds."" The character of the son however is a major flaw. A standard-issue cranky teen he disappears halfway through the film for little reason (its the ""Dad I want to do it myself"" gambit) and -- quite frankly -- hes annoying. Theres no need for a son in the film; its really a father-daughter story and thats where the films heart resides.Tim Robbins turns up as a deranged man named Ogilvy a character based on ""the Curate"" from Wellss original story. Spielberg is confident enough to cut away from the main action when Ogilvy Ray and Rachel are trapped in the basement of a farmhouse surrounded by alien machines. At this point ""War of the Worlds"" is more than a sci-fi thriller -- its an intense psychological drama.Spielbergs exceptional talents -- as both a filmmaker and a storyteller -- are on full display throughout the film. As for Cruise he can never really step out of his indelible image as Tom Cruise International Megastar but he nevertheless delivers a solid performance flaring his nostrils on cue.Screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp -- undoubtedly guided closely by both Spielberg and Cruise -- have crafted a script that adheres to both the spirit and the basic structure of Wells original story adding some horrific set pieces.If only Spielberg had had faith enough to follow his own path instead of going with the abrupt Wells-ian ending. The ""say what?"" conclusion is a little too cute -- and not up to the standards of the rest of the film.That said ""War of the Worlds"" is one hell of a ride. The special effects are seamless and the story succeeds in being both touching and horrifying. ""War of the Worlds"" can be a nightmarish trip but its a terrific film a blockbuster that lives up to its billing.

"Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds. Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 28 2005 623 PM They Came From Below Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds. By David Edelstein If we see the darn movie will Tom Cruise go away please? Steven Spielbergs remake of War of the Worlds (Paramount Pictures) is a devastating mixture of tumult and emotion--full catastrophe living with soul. The director is right there inside the feverish head of his protagonist dock worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise); the whole film is told from Rays limited vantage. The FX are terrifying but War of the Worlds is in a different league than that empty theme park of a movie Jurassic Park. True it has a ham-fisted script a bewildering objective for its hero (it involves getting from New Jersey to Boston) and an ending that--given the level of tension--isnt cathartic enough. But this is a blockbuster that transcends summer blockbusters. In all the ways that matter its pure. Its not your fathers War of the Worlds--but it is a fathers War of the Worlds. Cruises Ferrier isnt some manly alien-slayer--although he does have a terrific gotcha scene thats a sop to the audience which certainly needs a sop at that grim juncture. Largely hes a man who runs away from towering tendriled three-legged alien death-ray machines. All he can think about is saving his young daughter (Dakota Fanning) and headstrong teenage son (Justin Chatwin) who challenges his every move. Advertisement The film opens with Ray hurrying home (working-class Bayonne N.J. with the humplike Bayonne Bridge in the background just itching to be blown up) to take his kids from his pregnant ex-wife Mary Anne (Miranda Otto) and her yuppie husband (David Alan Basche). Mary Anne says significantly ""Take care of our kids""--which is a both an exhortation and a rebuke. Ray has never taken his responsibilities as a dad seriously and hes defensive and irritable. His son mocks him; his daughter has moved beyond him. He sulks off to his bedroom and when he emerges the world is on the brink of upheaval. The screenplay (by Josh Friedman and David Koepp) plants thematic signposts all over the place (Ray must learn to think of someone other than himself etc.) and Rays son has a bizarre impulse to follow the army into battle that isnt very well dramatized. But Spielbergs handling couldnt be more subtle or Cruises performance more quick-witted. Ray is a poor communicator but in his prickly paranoid way hes responsive to everything and Cruise seems to be plumbing his own anger to bring out all the characters inner tension. If Ray is never a great dad Cruise makes it clear that hes operating with dadlike primal instincts His reaction time is faster than his thinking. This War of the Worlds doesnt bear much resemblance to H.G. Wells novel or to the Orson Welles 30s radio play that used it as a springboard and caused a national panic. Parts of the more faithful 1953 George Pal/Byron Haskin film were actually scarier. Its still shocking in that movie to see three humans approach the first alien ship waving flags and hollering friendly greetings only to be incinerated leaving a white-ash outline of their bodies on the ground. Id like to think that Spielberg found this scene too heartbreaking to re-create Its a reversal of his Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which the aliens who beckon are welcoming beatific and harmoniously musical. In the new film the giant alien walking machines emit a theater-shaking metallic honk before commencing the carnage. Its the perfect sound of death from above. In the past Spielbergs nice aliens have been replacements for absent dads. Now for a change its the dad who has to be a dad. The opening is brilliantly low-key with ominous TV news reports of lightning bolts and electronic pulses. When black roiling clouds approach the city Ray calls to his daughter ""Wanna see something cool?"" He thinks its great--the way we all secretly hope for a violent storm from time to time to give us a little jolt. But the lightning keeps striking the same place and the eerie quiet that follows--with only the jingling of wind chimes and the distant barking of dogs--wipes the grin off Rays face. His daughter asks ""Is it gonna be OK?"" and he says ""I dunno I dunno."" Her stricken reaction confirms that this is not what a daddy is supposed to say. (Stricken comes easy to the goggle-eyed Fanning I dont recall her blinking in the entire film.) Advertisement Later John Williams provides some ambient almost subliminal accompaniment but much of the action has no music underneath it. Its the silence--and the otherworldly sound--that eats into your mind. The sequence in which the first alien ship breaks through the asphalt--the gimmick here is that they come from below--is as bloodcurdling as anything in movies with mysterious rumblings fissures in the road buildings collapsing in stages and finally the rise of the machine Its like some kind of spider-squid topped with an elongated reptilian head reminiscent of H.R. Gigers alien. As amazing as these FX are Spielbergs virtuosity with humans counts for more. When Ray bounces frantically around his living room gathering up the familys belongings unable to tell his kids that he has just seen a city block destroyed and hundreds of people disintegrated the hand-held camera swerves with him. Its not a showy effect. Its just perfect for what the character--and the audience--is feeling. The scenes with seething crowds are the work of a humanist as well as a master filmmaker. Even when people attack one another you never lose sight of their underlying terror and desperation. Late in the film theres a sequence as great as anything that Spielberg or Cruise has ever done. Its in a basement with Tim Robbins (broad but sensationally effective) as Ogilvy a man who has lost his family and gone around the bend. He wants to take the aliens on but Ray knows that this likely means death and more important death for his daughter. The bit with the alien probe that snakes around sometimes rising up like a cobra is superb but its standard horror-movie stuff. Then Ogilvy goes for his shotgun and Ray tries to get it away from him and the two struggle silently for a long time practically arm-wrestling staring into each others eyes one bent on violence the other on stopping that violence. Thats what youll remember from War of the Worlds that ferocious stillness and its morally devastating aftermath. No wonder the ending (straight out of Wells) is such a letdown. Its a deus ex machina for a devil ex machina but its the human struggle that makes this a sci-fi masterpiece. Update Ill be doing one of those strange disjunctive Washington Post ""live chats"" today at 1 p.m. E.T. on the subject of War of the Worlds. Related topics include H.G. Wells Spielberg Spielbergs aliens aliens in general general alienation Tom amp; Katie Scientology the perfidy of antidepressants al-Qaida parallels childrearing in the age of terrorism and why its good to drink ""free trade"" coffee. (As usual Ill be tapping away over a series of triple espressos at Brooklyns Gorilla Coffee.) Click here  and join me if youre so inclined. Update 2 Thanks everyone for a very pleasant discussion last Wednesday about War of the Worlds. Much of it was devoted to Tom Cruises recent manic behavior but that was to be expected as many people hadnt yet seen the movie. You can read the transcript at the Washington Post site here. There are good questions relating to 9/11 Iraq H.G. Wells the films unsatisfing conclusion fatherhood colonialism and any hidden political messages that might or might not be there. One clarification Because of fuzzy grammar (these things are typed on the fly) I seem to be saying--while citing Magnolia--that Cruise has father issues and needs therapy. I was speaking of course about the macho misogynistic character he plays not about the actor. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Tom Cruise and a massive marketing push look to deliver the biggest B.O. haul Spielberg has enjoyed in quite a few years. A generation later Steven Spielberg has made the anti-""Close Encounters"" in ""War of the Worlds"" a gritty intense and supremely accomplished sci-fier about some distinctly unbenign alien invaders. Latest adaptation of H.G. Wells endlessly malleable and resonant 1898 novel preys upon the insecurities of a modern audience thats more fearful and skittish than was the case when the director made his optimistic early-career smashes about outer space visitors. Relentless mix of breath-sapping scares awesome spectacle Tom Cruise and a massive marketing push look to deliver the biggest B.O. haul Spielberg has enjoyed in quite a few years. With each telling this elemental story -- the first ever written about an alien assault on Earth -- offers a subtext appropriate to the paranoia of its era. Wells original reflected attitudes about the British Empire as well as the rapid rise of science and technology; Orson Welles panic-inducing 1938 radio broadcast (which had a New Jersey setting as does Spielbergs film) arrived less than a year before World War II broke out; and the George Pal/Byron Haskin 1953 feature was very much a product of the anti-communist Cold War mentality. Implicitly then this new take exists in the shadow of 9/11 and fears of new enemies bent on nothing less than the total destruction of the West in general and the United States in particular. Granted ""War of the Worlds"" arrives after such pics as ""Independence Day"" ""Armageddon"" and many others have served up similar doomsday portraits in vivid detail so such images are now commonplace in the collective pop culture mind. But Spielbergs vision of worldly wipeout has such visceral immediacy that it connects almost at once and rarely flags until the end. For a 135 million special effects epic its striking how grungy and ordinary it looks. Foregoing the widescreen format desaturating the colors and focusing on nondescript working-class neighborhoods Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski employ a raw inelegant visual style to disguise the films extraordinary stylistic sophistication and make seamless the interlacing of real and computerized action. No sooner has dockworker Ray Ferrier (Cruise) taken weekend custody of his kids disaffected teen son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and nervous daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) from newly married ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) than dark clouds envelope the low-end waterfront area and thunderless lightning bolts hit the ground knocking out electricity and motor vehicles. In effects that look as realistic as the humdrum setting streets crack open and collapse buildings crumble and an enormous warrior robot rises from beneath the ground and starts firing away with an incinerating ray vaporizing fleeing Earthlings and blowing up anything it wants. This is annihilation without explanation. In its frenzy of surprise firepower and sudden death this initial action salvo packs a punch not unlike that of the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" albeit with a PG-13 gore factor. Spielberg is very good at filming frenzied flight -- his films are full of it -- and showing the characters subjected to the attack as fish in a barrel. Somehow Ray figures out how to get a car started and manages to spirit his kids off to Mary Anns house where they pass a tense night. In the morning they are greeted by the sight of a crashed passenger jet and members of a news crew who inform them the 100-foot ""tripods"" are wreaking destruction everywhere. Despite this Ray is determined to get the kids to Boston where Mary Ann and her husband are visiting her parents. From here on Spielberg paints a portrait of devastated humanity that at times takes on medieval overtones in its evocation of widespread arbitrary suffering and every-man-for-himself opportunism while a pitiless force rains down pestilence on a suddenly pathetic-looking race. Its a canvas that has room for some striking surreal brush strokes such as Rachel witnessing dozens of bodies floating down a river or a blazing night train roaring down the tracks. Amid the mayhem the volatile Ray cant keep his fractured family unified. Overcompensating for his failure as a husband and father by yelling a lot and trying to appear in charge when hes not he drives his son away and maintains control of Rachel only due to her youth and his promise to get her back to her mom. Hes supposed to be a regular Joe with plenty of foibles but good survival instincts. But he also seems to be on uppers as Cruise is in overdrive virtually throughout. Its easy to see why Spielberg wanted the commercial cushion of an above-the-title superstar but this is no more a performance-based picture than ""Jurassic Park"" and might have proven more balanced and artistically effective with a no-name cast. Ironically the suspense highlight is provided by the films most intimate and quiet scene. Encountering a half-cracked man Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) at a farmhouse Ray and Rachel hide with him in the basement which is soon penetrated by an enormous tentacle that slithers around every wall and post as the humans scurry to avoid detection. The framing cutting and timing of this breathless sequence are unerring revealing the master hands of Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn. Interlude precedes the long-delayed revelation of the aliens themselves nasty looking buggers with dark crustacean-like heads and emaciated versions of a human torso (unlike all previous versions this one does not identify them as Martians). There is more terror in store but when the end comes -- the solution is taken directly from the novel -- it arrives suddenly with brief framing narration intoned by Morgan Freeman easing the viewer out of the nightmare. Quiet conclusion may leave some feeling a bit hollow at fadeout but muted wrap-up is refreshing after all the overdone slam-bang action climaxes of recent years. Except for the anonymous soldiers obliged to do their duty pic completely eschews the military and government types that are normally standard issue in this sort of fare just as Spielberg and scenarists Josh Friedman (the upcoming ""The Black Dahlia"") and David Koepp (""Jurassic Park"") avoid the cliche of showing landmarks being destroyed. ""War of the Worlds"" alludes to many of Spielbergs previous works and not just his sci-fi features. The contrast could not be more obvious between the gentle-spirited aliens of ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."" and the present films murdering monsters. But there are unstressed echoes of many other pictures the societal upheaval and personal displacement of ""Empire of the Sun"" the genocide of ""Schindlers List"" the sudden and arbitrary slaughter of ""Saving Private Ryan"" the mass hysteria of ""Jaws"" the fractious motorized family struggle of ""The Sugarland Express."" Making the film look as grubby as it does was inspired as it both enhances the actions believability and distinguishes the picture from the grandiose physicality of its big-budget brethren. Never before have such diverse and numerous visual effects appeared more naturalistic and undifferentiated from the actual photographed material. Tech contributions are first-rate across the board and John Williams string-dominated score is unusually somber even mournful.
