Why did they ever get made? Didnt anyone know how bad they were from the start? Then there is ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" which provokes wonderment pure and simple. How did it ever get made? Did the people who financed and created it know how magical and piercingly beautiful it would be? They couldnt have known at the outset. Benh Zeitlins debut feature evokes life in a surpassingly strange corner of Louisiana through the ecstatic spirit of a 6-year-old black girl named Hushpuppy. Theres no trace of calculation only artistic ambitions and hopes that have come to fruition in the years finest film thus far. Most of the action takes place in the Bathtub a tiny community of impoverished locals--black and white some descended from Cajun or Indian fishermen--in South Louisianas bayou country. Because the Bathtub lies outside the levee system it will overflow in an impending hurricane and Hushpuppy knows as well as everyone else that ramshackle homes and precious possessions will be swept away. ""Any day now the fabric of the universe is comin unraveled"" she declares. Hushpuppys mind is all aswirl with animist signs and ominous portents--consuming fire; another ""Iced Age""; the mythical beasts of the title derived from the extinct aurochs that threaten rampant destruction. She speaks in quasipoetic phrases that might seem impossibly pretentious if they werent so rich and original and if the child speaking them--a nonprofessional named Quvenzhane Wallis--werent so madly enchanting. (Hushpuppys father a passionate violent and grievously ill man named Wink is played by another astonishingly eloquent nonprofessional Dwight Henry. In fact the entire cast is nonprofessional.) ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" directed by Benh Zeitlin follows six-year-old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) as she deals with her fathers ailing health and an epic storm. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Fox Searchlight. Language is key to the enchantment of the film as a whole. Not just the words which the director and Lucy Alibar adapted from Ms. Alibars stage play ""Juicy and Delicious"" but the stylized cinematic language of Ben Richardsons images as edited by Crockett Doob and Affonso Goncalves. This is a low-budget production that looks like a million dollars greatly multiplied. Fireworks flash and sparkle. Hands thrust into a stream come up with thrashing catfish. (Wink has built a boat for himself from an asthmatic outboard a truck body and 55-gallon drums lashed into service as pontoons.) In a floating crab shack and whorehouse called Elysian Fields dancers drift through a humid haze to the strains of Fats Wallers ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along."" And when the hurricane comes along its the visual equivalent of what Noah in ""The Green Pastures"" calls ""a complete storm"" a deluge that tests the communitys attachment to its precarious place and endangered way of life. ""Get in here"" a good-natured waitress at Elysian Fields tells Hushpuppy who in the midst of everything else has been searching for her dead mother. ""Lemme show you a magic trick."" The whole movie is a magic trick and part of the magic is that it can be seen in various ways. The setting provides a metaphorical divide between rich and poor ""Aint that ugly over there?"" Hushpuppy says of the industrial landscape on the other side of the levee. ""We got the prettiest place on earth."" (The divide is undermined when wily residents of the flood-beset Bathtub figure out a way to drain it more quickly than Mother Nature might have planned.) The film can equally be seen as an ethnographic project guided mainly by two white Americans Mr. Zeitlin and Ms. Alibar with an unquenchable interest in how people of a remote region live think speak and sing. The sound track is a treasure. Even the kitchen implements have an exotic allure. But the best way to see ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is to sit back let its pleasures wash over you and forget at least for the duration of the experience about making distinctions between whats real--and shockingly harsh--in Hushpuppys life and whats boiling in her imagination. Scenes stay vivid long after the experience has ended Wink raging against the storm by shooting at it with his rifle; Hushpuppy tracing a record of her being like a cave girl scratching pictograms (""Once there was a Hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub""); a boozy neighbor bottle to lips stepping out of his front door into deep water; those aurochses on the march; Hushpuppys shrill trills of joy and the slow burn of her comprehension as she sees her father where hed feared to be in a hospital bed plugged into the wall. At its core Mr. Zeitlins film is a tale of daughter and father struggling to survive. Wink is not the father that Hushpuppys vanished mother would have wanted him to be. He drinks and gives his little girl ample tastes too. He feeds her slops--""Share wit the dog"" he barks--and knocks her around in the course of loving and trying to protect her. There are no boundaries between rage and love in their life and one of the productions many mysteries is how a man with no dramatic training--Mr. Henry runs a bakery in the town where the movie was shot--could have delivered such a magnificent performance. For Winks daughter--the angel-faced fiercely focused girl that Quvenzhane Wallis plays with uncanny grace--he is the source of all wisdom as well as love. A psychologist might say that he holds her in his thrall by keeping her off balance with wildly unpredictable behavior but Hushpuppy knows only that she adores him and believes in him and will survive thanks to the lessons she has learned from him. Hers is an unconditional love and its not so far removed from what you may feel for this stirring and ultimately thrilling movie. ENLARGE Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum in Magic Mike Warner Bros. Pictures Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum star in ""Magic Mike"" a film that follows a male stripper as he teaches a younger performer the ropes. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Magic Mike ""You dont need to talk"" an appreciative female tells Channing Tatums male stripper Magic Mike. ""Just look pretty."" He looks pretty indeed whether or not hes on stage in a tacky Tampa club doing spectacular gyrations in charmingly silly routines. Mr. Tatum whose talents have been the subject of debate also makes Mike genuinely affecting not to mention articulate within the bounds of a sketchy script. The process is called acting and the man in the title role of Steven Soderberghs flashy not-so-trashy entertainment does it so well that the debate should be officially ended. Mike isnt just a fancy dancer but a striver with dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and a mentor who takes an aimless kid Alex Pettyfers Adam under his wing and gets him a job at the club. (The kid who comes to be known as The Kid is a fictional version of Mr. Tatum during a brief period in his life.) Matthew McConaughey dominates every scene hes in as Dallas the clubs malign owner and exultantly preening onstage host. The film which the director shot handsomely on a tight schedule feels partly improvised looks like ""Cabaret"" stripped of the Weimar grit and Fosse wit and plays like ""Boogie Nights"" without the porn miasma. Its cheerfully raunchy and delivers the goods for fans of male beefcake though with more innocence along with some sadness than would appear at first blush. Thats not to say the drama goes much deeper than the skin on vivid display. In the department of emotional development ""Magic Mike"" turns the unlikely trick of disembodiment. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and the title character voiced by Seth MacFarlane in Ted Universal Studios Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane star in MacFarlanes first feature-length comedy ""Ted"" about what happens when a boy and his stuffed bear grow up. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Universal Pictures. Ted Everyone admires economies of scale but an economy of scale might have been the saving grace of Seth MacFarlanes debut feature. ""Ted"" is often hilarious sometimes sweet and in the spirit of ""Family Guy"" consistently raunchy. Yet its seriously overextended and as the premise wears ever thinner frantically overproduced. (The director worked from a script credited to him Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.) As you probably know by now--the movies marketing campaign has been intense--Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett an amiable guy though in the spirit of Peter Griffin not super-bright. Ted an animated creature voiced by Mr. MacFarlane is the potty-mouthed and compulsively womanizing teddy bear who has been Johns best buddy since childhood. Theirs is a beautiful romance albeit a turbulent one threatened only by Johns love for Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) a beautiful human whos been waiting impatiently for John to grow up and put aside the childish thing that continues to rule his life. Ms. Kunis makes a strong case for intraspecies relationships though she lacks the sparkle of some previous performances and its great fun to watch John and Ted in the deliciously casual course of their dailiness or at one startling flash point in the agony of duking it out. Yet everything goes on too long--Teds carousing Loris watchful waiting Johns wistful indecision. The movie started to lose me around the time of a silly plot turn involving Norah Jones then lost me completely during an interminable car chase--car chases being the standard studio solution for script problems--followed by an out-of-scale sequence at Fenway Park. Ted doesnt age but ""Ted"" does. People Like Us Going on too long seems to be the disease of the week; its certainly what brings this movie down though the going on here stems from a surfeit of implausible plot that suffocates the main characters and the excellent actors who play them. ""People Like Us"" is a debut feature by Alex Kurtzman; he wrote the script with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert. Although the trailer lays the whole thing out in unseemly detail Ill be more circumspect and say only that Chris Pines Sam a salesman with suddenly desperate financial problems discovers family secrets after the death of his estranged father who has left a bundle of cash to be given to someone Sam has never heard of. Mr. Kurtzman is good with actors and the film begins promisingly with Mr. Pines portrait of a fast-talking man on the edge. Sam talks so fast that I wondered if hed fall victim to what Ive begun to consider since the frenzied debut of ""The Newsroom"" as the Aaron Sorkin syndrome. No need to worry about that though; he slows down when the movie slows to a crawl. The hitherto unknown someone played with verve and touching simplicity by Elizabeth Banks is Frankie a single mother and a recovering alcoholic who tends bar at a luxury hotel. (In this script glib juxtapositions pass for dilemmas.) It seems ridiculous to dance around plot details when the movie allows the audience to get ahead of the story and to stay there as events laboriously unfold. Still all youll learn here is that Sam by misrepresenting himself to Frankie from the start sustains a state of suspense that is not only unsustainable but manifestly nonsensical. Two actors are appealing in smaller roles Michael Hall DAddario as Frankies young son and Olivia Wilde as Hannah Sams girlfriend. The wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer is not so wonderfully stuck with playing Lillian Sams mother. To lend Lillian gravitas the movie equips her with glasses and a heart condition.

At area theaters. ""People Like Us"" is so unlike the blockbusters screenwriter Alex Kurtzman has penned or produced that its pretty clear this family drama was a labor of love. Directing for the first time the co-writer of the rebooted ""Star Trek"" and ""Transformers"" franchise (the fun first foray and its awful first sequel) among other credits tweaked a personal story to make this one about a man who discovers that he has an older half sister. As a youngster Kurtzman grew up knowing his father had a family from a previous marriage but he never met them. Then by happenstance he met his half sister at a party. Chris Pine plays Sam. Were introduced to the 20-something salesman in a hopped-up opener intended to underscore just how hard-charging he can be. The same day the fast-talking hawker runs into a professional snag he also learns his father has died unexpectedly and though he doesnt want to he flies to Los Angeles with girlfriend Hannah (Olivia Wilde). Its clear from his arrival hes put a great deal of distance between himself and his childhood home. Dad was a rock producer during the 70s and 80s and his attic lair is a trove but also a monument to how little he was around for Sam. Portraying Sams mother Michelle Pfeiffer moves with agile emotion between grief and frustration as her only child makes it clear how much he doesnt want to be home. Things become complicated when Sam learns from his fathers longtime friend and attorney played by Philip Baker Hall (good at bringing gravity to a scene in short order) that his father wanted him to take care of some unfinished business. Elizabeth Banks portrays Frankie the older sibling Sam had no clue about. Shes a recovering alcoholic a bartender and a single mom to Josh (Michael Hall DAddario). Sam befriends Frankie at an AA meeting. He meets Josh while the kids boosting albums at a record store. ""People Like Us"" revolves around the time-bomb problem Sam creates as he waits to tell Frankie who he really is. Kurtzmans longtime partner in producing and writing Robert Orci co-wrote the screenplay as did Jody Lambert. And the movie is a hybrid outing. It has some clunky first-feature problems borne of wanting to cram too much life into the drama. But worse things can happen to a film than heartfelt ambition. It also comes with the visual polish -- and rocking soundtrack -- that deeper pockets can afford. Even so ""People Like Us"" serves as a reminder of how few dramas Hollywood makes these days. Sure there are dramedies and genre projects with dramatic underpinnings but a family drama rich with aches resentments and forgiveness has become the purview of indie films and even they steer clear. Its encouraging to see a wielder of studio heft test his mettle with the all-too-human. In a season of superheroes and their nemeses Kurtzman takes on characters hurting hoping trying to rise to the occasion of family. Its worth giving him a hand for trying his hand at people well a little more like us.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 29 2012 Save for later Saved In People Like Us Sam (Chris Pine l.) finds out he has a half-sister (Elizabeth Banks center) and nephew (Michael Hall DAddario r.) he never knew about. Disney Dreamworks II/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Lone Ranger 5 other TV shows that became movies Monitor Movie Guide Alex Kurtzmans ""People Like Us"" seems to have been devised for audiences who want to experience an entire years worth of soap opera complications in a single sitting. Chris Pine plays Sam a go-getter salesman whose estranged father has just died leaving him 150000 in cash. The catch is that the money is intended for a daughter his father had out of wedlock years before and abandoned. In other words Sam has a half sister Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) and an adolescent nephew Josh (Michael Hall DAddario) he never knew about.Instead of just leveling with Frankie and giving her the money (which he could sorely use for his own debts) Sam spends quality time with her while pretending to be a member of her AA group. We keep waiting - and waiting - for him to tell her who he is. But of course if he told her early on there wouldnt be much of a movie. As it is there isnt much of one anyway although Banks as the struggling bitter resilient Frankie is good. The most interesting plot development - Frankie starts falling for Sam - is nipped in the bud. Some things even a soap opera wont stoop to.

I was surprised by the mixed reviews. I thought Pines character should have come clean a little earlier in the movie. John Arthur Beamansaid on Saturday July 07 2012 62826 PMI could have easily felt frustrated that Sam wasnt coming clean a lot sooner but that quickly became a small point. There were just too many good things happening on screen to pick it apart for a minor problem. Huntersaid on Sunday July 01 2012 90416 PMI found it hilarious how you basically you called the core cast save Pine ugly. Haha that was good Reply from Richard Roeper Hunter I was KIDDING. Obviously Elizabeth Banks Olivia Wilde and Michelle Pfeiffer are among the most attractive human beings on the planet.

Reply from Richard Roeper Thanks Steven. Fixed it. Alansaid on Thursday June 28 2012 95226 PMHavent seen it but I read the script a while ago and thought it was a well-written and intelligent script that offered rounded roles for its cast giving them a chance to play comedy and pathos. I thought the trailer looked tacky but I am glad to hear that K-dog pulled off the promise of his script. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Hes a middle man a barterer continually on the phone flouting various federal regulations in the continued search for commerce. Hell trade you tires for chickens taking only a small percentage for his troubles. Hes eminently likable though also massively smarmy. However when a personal lightning bolt hits him - his father has passed away - hes drawn back to the homefront to put his fathers affairs in order. Yep ""People Like Us"" is set up in the same manner as ""Elizabethtown"" but with Michelle Pfeiffer instead of Susan Sarandon and Olivia Wilde instead of Kirsten Dunst. This is progress? Seriously though ""People Like Us"" is a story about relationships be they of the girlfriend sibling maternal or paternal variety. And so far as the acting goes its a pretty solid little piece of filmmaking. There are a few ""gems"" of performances on display. Elizabeth Banks is great as Frankie a bartender who works hard for her money and whom is rarely treated right. Olivia Wilde (as Hannah) is Sams girlfriend and she does well in a somewhat limited role. Michelle Pfeiffer is Sams mother and shes equal parts jagged edges and sorrow which rings especially true given the circumstances. No theres no quibbling with the actors (or the acting) on display in ""People Like Us."" Instead the plot choices undermine the whole equation as theres a false tension throughout that can only be delved into with spoilers ... which we simply dont cotton to around these parts. The fact is and because of this ""one big choice"" its safe to say the middle of ""People Like Us"" drags like an overgrown tortoise. The structure of the piece is all wonky suffocating the momentum before it ever really gets started. The relationship between Sam and Frankie is highly convoluted which isnt a deal breaker per se but does lead to more than one scene where youll throw your hands up at the screen in exasperation. If theres one annoying technique thats infiltrated the industry refusing to be eradicated its the ""main character hiding a big secret from other main character"" method. It doesnt allow an audience any room to intellectually operate. Were omniscient in this equation as we know whats being hidden but were also painfully aware nothing can move forward until the person on-screen is fully cognizant as well. So you end up thinking over and over ""well he should have told her right there"" and ""Ugh how does she not ask more questions?"" As an audience we need something to figure out to chew on or to ponder what wed do in a similar sticky situation. The answers to everything in ""People Like Us"" are mostly too easy youd simply be up-front with people when given the opportunity right? Thats not at all what happens here. To its credit ""People Like Us"" ends very well. Theres a really touching and heartfelt scene and youll likely find yourself drawn into the film anew at this point. But youre already two hours in Sure this ""closer"" moment works on an emotional level but its not worth the time it takes to get there. Sadly enough ""People Like Us"" doesnt seem to be about people like us after all. Its about people in a movie that hide big plot-changing secrets from each other for an hour and theres very little thats modern exciting or worth recommending about that process.

"Throw brother and sister into a rom-com and you get People Like Us |       NJ.com comments Throw brother and sister into a rom-com and you get People Like Us Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 29 2012 at 745 AM View/Post Comments DreamWorks/MCTSam (Chris Pine) and Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) the sister he has just discovered with her son Josh (Michael DAddario). Sam is a wheeler-dealer a businessman skilled at transactions that leave everyone thinking they came out ahead but end up profiting him the most. There isnt a problem he doesnt know how to handle. Until now. Because first he finds out that his latest deal may send him to prison. Then he gets word that his father has died. And then he discovers that his fathers will has a job for him Deliver 150000 to his sister. A sister Sam never knew he had. ""People Like Us"" is directed by Alex Kurtzman and written by him and longtime script partner Roberto Orci. They worked together on the ""Star Trek"" reboot and the third ""Mission Impossible"" and while those were slick this is clearly their shot at something serious. But its seriously by the numbers. Although Sam and his sister Frankie are clearly never going to be romantic partners the screenplay treats this like any other carefully diagrammed rom-com. So of course Sam doesnt just give her the money and tell her the truth. He lies and continues to even though he has plenty of chances not to (or to back off and let his lawyers handle it). And of course come the third act she has to find out about his deceptions and freak out and throw him out and he has to give up and walk out of her life -- before running back. I understand Kurtzman and Orci wanting to show they can write a straightforward drama. But what theyve really done is stitch together a decades worth of Katherine Heigl/Jennifer Aniston/Kate Hudson romantic comedies and then cut out all the romance and most of the comedy. Chris Pine who worked on ""Star Trek"" with Kurtzman and Orci is probably eager to show his serious side too. But cultivating some picturesque stubble is not the same thing as creating a character; in his two dramatic scenes with Jon Favreau and Philip Baker Hall the other actors blow him away. Best here is Elizabeth Banks who plays the sexy plucky single mom or as it used to be called in the 70s the Marsha Mason Role. Its the best part here and Banks a continually underestimated actress -- ""W"" would have changed things for her if anyone had seen it -- is terrific. She has a sort of drawn weariness a perpetual tan cant hide a deep sadness the whole Sunset Strip boots-and-leather-and-fishnets costume cant disguise. Shes a woman whos been hurt and knows shell be hurt again. And whats worse is she doesnt mind anymore. Id watch a movie just about her (particularly if it toned down the character of her son pumped up with artificial movie-brat insolence). But unfortunately its Sam whos the main character although hes not particularly interesting (even though in hopes of making him so the film gets him drunk or stoned several times). Pine is handsome (and at least someone or something has toned down the assisted cobalt blue of his eyes in the awful ""This Means War"" that made him look like an alien). And Banks is a good actress. But ""People Like Us"" is at best a harmless waste of their time and ours. Ratings note The film contains strong language and substance abuse. People Like Us (PG-13) Touchstone/DreamWorks (117 min.) Directed by Alex Kurtzman. With Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks. Now playing in New Jersey.

HOEP From left Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks and Michael DAddario in a scene from ""People Like Us."" (AP Photo/Disney-DreamWorks II) Note to self Be careful what you wish for.Critics complain that most movies are prepackaged concepts with no room for human emotions. Then along comes a sugar-coated turkey such as ""People Like Us"" and we sharpen our fangs. Yet its hard to resist dissing a drama that violates the most basic rule of storytelling that a hero must actually do something.The Hamlet defense does not apply to Sam (Chris Pine) a New York wheeler-dealer with a hot girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) and lukewarm ethics. When he learns that his estranged record-producer father has died in Hollywood Sam tries to avoid attending the funeral. But soon he finds himself stuck in a Laurel Canyon cottage with his brittle trophy mom (Michelle Pfeiffer) and mountains of memorabilia. There seems to be a silver lining -- a stash of cash that Sam could use to pay off a debt -- but theres a catch Dear old Dad intended Sam to give the money to a youngster named Josh (Michael Hall DAddario) who lives with single mom Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) on the wrong side of the tracks. It turns out that recovering alcoholic Frankie is Sams secret sister the love child of Dads liaison with a groupie.Instead of doing his duty Sam spends almost the entire movie befriending Josh and flirting with Frankie as if he were just another AA member who is passing through town. This holding pattern might have stirred up some incestuous tension but ""People Like Us"" is as cautious as the character at its hollow center.Ironically (and implausibly) Sam is a music snob who teaches precocious Josh about bands such as the Clash and Joy Division. Yet the movie is mired in a saccharine soundtrack that underscores every feeling. The quasi-autobiographical script by novice director Alex Kurtzman (""Transformers"") lays down a series of Styrofoam obstacles -- Sams debt Joshs delinquency the mothers malfunctioning heart -- in order to neatly surmount them in time for a group hug.Pine and the always-watchable Banks make the best of a bad screenplay but ""People Like Us"" gives us nothing that we can relate to.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 29 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Jul. 09 2012 1214PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alex Kurtzman Written by Alex Kurtzman Robert Orci and Jody Lambert Starring Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks and Michelle Pfeiffer Classification PG Genre drama Year 2012 Country USA Language English Theres a point and the new DreamWorks drama People Like Us definitely crosses it when the conventional heart-tugging feel-good Hollywood drama becomes distinctly creepy. Superficially the film by veteran screenwriter-producer Alex Kurtzman is in the Cameron Crowe or James Brooks style a tale of a selfish jerk who learns to care for others but along the way things get unintentionally very weird. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film "" People Like Us"" starring Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks Movies People Like Us The official trailer The opening scenes establish Sam (Star Treks Chris Pine) as a speed-talking barter trader who gets himself in deep trouble in a scam in which soup boxes explode in an unrefrigerated box car. His boss (Jon Favreau) is on the verge of firing him the Federal Trade Commission is on the verge of investigating him and then Sam gets news that his father a famous Los Angeles record producer from whom he has been long estranged is dead.After deliberately missing the plane to Los Angeles that would get him there in time for the funeral Sam finally heads out to the coast with his girlfriend Hannah (Olivia Wilde) in tow. His mother Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) slaps his face before welcoming him back home after 13 years. People Like Us is that sort of on-the-nose drama where every emotional reaction is telegraphed and delivered right on cue.Soon Sam is invited to lunch by his fathers lawyer (Philip Baker Hall) who gives him a toiletry kit with 150000 in cash. The moneys not for Sam but for a bartender Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) and her 11-year-old son. Instead of calling her up Sam decides to find out who the woman is while mulling over whether to keep the money for himself.He follows her to an AA meeting where he learns that Frankie is his fathers daughter after she conveniently reads out her fathers obit from the newspaper. When Hannah conveniently heads back to New York Sam begins his sister-stalking campaign in earnest. After they meet he strikes up a rapport and begins working on Frankies soft spot her bright but troubled son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario in the standard precocious-brat mode). Sam encourages Joshs musical interests by providing him with lists of early 1980s British rock bands.But back to the sister. Everything depends on Sam withholding information from his sister and yet sticking around to get to know her. Though Sam assures her he would never hit on her Pines flirty gazes say otherwise. They fold laundry together and laugh over dinner at a late-night taco stand. All of this feels disturbingly like an incestuous rom-com. And thats not the end of it. Back at the house he smokes his fathers medical marijuana with his attractive mom leading to new kinds of inappropriateness. Hes wearing his fathers patchouli which she tells him used to really turn her on.The usual defence for these kinds of Hollywood soap operas is that the quality of the performances overcomes the contrivance of the script. Except in this case all the emoting in the world cant pull this one out. Pine with his pale blue gaze and artful perma-stubble communicates only one note at a time. Banks does better at creating a scrappy single mom though her litany of hard-luck stories seems unlikely. Pfeiffer gets a confessional scene that has that tempest-on-command quality that big stars are granted when theyre in small parts. This is the sort of movie that ends up awash in sincere revelations and not a moment of it feels remotely believable.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After the death of his father a young man meets the half-sister he never knew. BOTTOM LINE What happens when a family drama doubles as a love story? Apparently borderline sibling incest. Misguided to say the least. CAST CAST Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Michael Hall DAddario LENGTH 155 In ""People Like Us"" a slick corporate salesman Sam (Chris Pine) flies to Los Angeles for the funeral of his estranged father and receives shocking news He has a half-sister. Her name is Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) and Sam wants to meet her. Hes afraid however to reveal his true identity. Sams solution? He starts dating her. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Surely a heartwarming family drama could double as a love story without resorting to borderline incest but thats the weird solution ""People Like Us"" has hit upon. Pine and Banks are such an attractive couple -- Sam is a blue-eyed charmer Frankie is damaged goods in a hiked-up skirt -- that its easy to see why the movie wants to pair them up. The minute Sams girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) flies back home Sam poses as a newcomer to Frankies AA group then uses his excellent taste in rock bands to win over her surly 11-year-old Josh (Hicksvilles Michael Hall DAddario). As Sam and Frankie banter and bask in each other like movie lovers -- mostly at arms length -- the film seems barely aware of the queasy possibilities hovering around their courtship. If it werent for the whole shared-DNA problem ""People Like Us"" might have made a nice pot of romantic mush. First-time director Alex Kurtzman clearly cares about these characters (hes one of three screenwriters) and he gets nice performances from Banks as a dukes-up single mom and from DAddario as a good kid teetering on juvenile delinquency. One advantage of the overstuffed script is that bit players like Jon Favreau as Sams nasty boss and Michelle Pfeiffer as Sams mother Lillian get enough room to shine. Then theres that scene of Sam daubing on his late fathers patchouli oil which sends Lillian into a swoon. ""God"" she moans ""that used to turn me on.""

Cocky 80s-era Tom Cruise didnt seem like the hardest act in the world to pull off at the time yet few in todays generation of the young dumb and full of er confidence can match him. Mastering the born salesmans flashbulb smile the index fingers pointing up like goal posts the fast-talking and shades-wearing proved beyond Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Love and Other Drugs."" Now its Chris Pines turn to step up and whiff in the teary drama ""People Like Us"" one of those ""heartfelt"" dramas that was obviously dreamed up to win awards but fell short and is instead being dumped before awards season. Pine plays an ethically flexible sales dude (actually hes in the big-time barter industry whatever that is) who when told by his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde increasingly resembling a javelin with cheekbones) that his dad is dead says ""Whats for dinner?"" Sam (Pine) didnt get along with Dad a rock-music producer who left his son nothing but some old records -- and a leather bag containing 150000. This money is to be delivered to a boy named Josh (Michael Hall DAddario) and his barmaid mom Frankie (Elizabeth Banks). A little elementary sleuthing reveals that she is Sams half-sister by another mother. Sam while staying with his disapproving mom (Michelle Pfeiffer) in LA muses aloud that maybe hell just go ahead and keep the money which is the kind of disposable first-act character trait that every person in the audience knows is meant simply to be the starting point for an ""arc"" of glorious change. His girlfriend leaves him in a huff but so little thought went into her (""shes nice"" seems to be all the writers bothered to imagine) that youll hardly notice. If Sam is such a heel (at least in Act 1) why does he stalk Frankies son and strike up a warm friendship with him in a CD store? And why does he also stalk Frankie herself and begin a weirdly flirtatious friendship? There are a dozen reasons why he should tell her hes her brother and hell have to tell her eventually anyway but heres the only reason he doesnt because hes a character in a movie and movies have to run an hour and a half or so. ""People Like Us"" isnt written for people like us; its written for aliens or cave dwellers who have never seen a movie. So cue lots of bizarre romantic scenes with this strange new couple sharing secrets and having laughs. Sam gradually becomes a father figure to the boy a creation of the Smart-Talking Troubled Youth Macro No. 4 on Final Draft software. The considerable talents of Banks make the movie bearable as we wait for the screenwriters (Alex Kurtzman Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert the first two associated with middling TV shows like ""Alias"") and director (Kurtzman) to catch up to the audience. The implied incest behind the icky flirting isnt even the most inbred thing about the movie; each of the four principal characters sounds the same (like a smart-assed but not particularly funny cynic). Toward the end of the movie when we finally hear the dead dads much-trumpeted six rules for living one rule is ""Whatever you think is important isnt; whatever you think isnt important is."" Its obvious that the writers think this film is important.

Starring Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Olivia Wilde Michael Hall DAddario Philip Baker Hall Mark Duplass Michelle Pfeiffer Director Alex Kurtzman Running time 155 Release Opened Jun 29 2012  Editorial Review Mysteries lead to more family liesBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 29 2012Theres an inherent contradiction in any film that employs movie stars and then expects us to believe that these gorgeous wealthy creatures are ordinary Joes. But we buy into it if the story is honest enough because we want -- and probably need -- to. In ""People Like Us"" the story of a man who discovers a half-sister he never knew he had it might take the audience a bit longer than average to come around in part because the films title sets up an implicit challenge. Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks are just like us? Really? Eventually however we do thanks to the heartfelt and touching telling of the tale by filmmaker Alex Kurtzman. Known as the writer of such summer blockbusters as ""Star Trek"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" Kurtzman based his directorial debut loosely on his life. He met his own half-sister when he turned 30. Ultimately the movies fundamental truth shines through the Hollywood gloss. Initially however part of the credibility problem lies with Pines Sam a slick salesman who learns that he has a half-sister Frankie (Banks) when his father dies leaving Sam 150000 and instructions to deliver it to Frankies 11-year-old son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario). Like his late father -- who successfully hid his second family from his son -- Sam is an inveterate liar. He lies to his customers he lies to his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) and he lies to his mother (Michelle Pfeiffer). In fact hes so good at dissembling that at times its hard to tell the difference between the characters lies and the actors. In other words for a while there the movie feels a little too much like a movie phony and scripted. Mostly Sam lies to Frankie whom at first he cant bring himself to tell about the money let alone the nature of their relationship. Instead Sam allows Frankie to believe that his preternatural interest in her might just be romantic. Whats obvious to the audience -- that shes slowly falling for her own brother as much for his charm as for his almost fatherly affection for Josh who never knew his father -- somehow escapes Sams notice until the films explosive climax. Thats when ""People Like Us"" cracks wide open revealing the messy -- and surprisingly genuine -- fears beneath Sams glad-handing facade. Frankies emotions on the other hand have always been closer to the surface. A recovering addict and struggling single mother of a problem child shes more of an open book even if its a tiny bit hard to swallow the hard-luck story written in it. Banks is just too drop-dead glamorous. But the movie wouldnt be able to crack open at all if there werent tiny fissures in in from the beginning. In fact its the flaws that Kurtzman builds into ""People Like Us"" that make it interesting. One of them is the character of Josh. As an angry wounded -- but deep down sweet -- kid DAddario is the antithesis of the professional Hollywood munchkin. He never feels less than wholly real whether hes setting off a chemical bomb at school breaking a classmates nose or accusing Sam of having inappropriate intentions toward him. That ambiguity around Sams sudden appearance in Frankies life -- underscored by his insistence that hes not hitting on her -- sets up the central tension of the film. Is he gay? A child molester? When the big reveal finally comes setting up the films message about the importance of family -- not to mention telling the truth -- all hell breaks lose but also a little bit of heaven too. Contains some crude language drug use and brief sexuality.

Alex Kurtzman who wrote Cowboys amp; Aliens and Transformers may not have been the ideal writer/director to pen a heartfelt story about personal redemption. His directorial debut with its quick-cutting style seems influenced by those action films. A gentler approach would have made the story more convincing.STORY Chris Pine gets beamed up to next level in People Like UsVIDEO Watch a clip from People Like UsSam (Chris Pine) a cocky New York salesman pulls an unlikely and whip-fast transformation from shady to kindhearted when he uncovers a startling family secret. His professional world unraveled on the same day he learned his estranged father had died and he grudgingly returns home to L.A.Upon arrival he immediately locks horns with his self-absorbed mom Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer). When nasty revelations about her surface she emerges as one of the least sympathetic moms to darken screens for a while.Sam meets with his fathers lawyer (Philip Baker Hall) and is given an odd task to hand over 150000 to Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) a woman living on the margins with her reckless 11-year-old son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario). The young actor convincingly portrays Josh who is a wayward wiseacre yet actually a lovable moppet.About the moviePeople Like Us out of fourStars Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Michelle Pfeiffer Michael Hall DAddario Olivia Wilde Mark Duplass Director Alex KurtzmanDistributor DreamWorks Pictures Rating PG-13 for language some drug use and brief sexuality Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Opens Friday nationwideIt turns out that Frankie is Sams half-sister his dads daughter from a liaison he had all but abandoned. Sam had no idea she existed.One of the hardest aspects to swallow is the way Sam chooses to interact with Frankie. Where most people would likely just introduce themselves Sam decides to sneakily insinuate himself in her life pretending to be a member of her AA group. It takes most of the movie before Sam tells Frankie his real identity well after the awkward moment in which Frankie mistakes his attentions for romantic ardor. The big reveal is of course what the drama hinges on. But it in no way resembles how real people act. So whats meant to be a major emotional climax feels forced.An intriguing aspect of the story is how differently brother and sister expressed their disappointment with their dad as children. Sam resented his fathers obsession with his work as a music producer and as an adult he never bothered to visit or call while his father battled cancer. Frankie spent most of her life yearning for him and craving contact.This emotional honesty is undercut by a cliched scene in which Sam relates ""six life lessons"" to Josh passed down from his dad as Frankie listens covertly from the hallway with a misty-eyed expression. Mired by its mawkish over-earnestness People Like Us doesnt actually resemble the behavior of real human beings. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Photo Zade Rosenthal Walt Disney Pictures People Like Us review painful procrastination 1 / 2 Back to Gallery People Like Us  Drama. Directed by Alex Kurtzman. Starring Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Call them Lying Dingbat Procrastinator movies films in which a main character motivated by selfishness cluelessness and fear postpones telling the truth to another main character and winds up digging himself into a huge hole. This takes several reels. The lies plunge him deeper and deeper. He makes dumber and dumber mistakes. No matter how well made well acted and well intentioned Lying Dingbat Procrastinator movies are excruciating to watch. Case in point ""People Like Us"" a film hell-bent on dragging its protagonist (and sadly us) through the LDP narrative playbook. In it Chris Pine plays Sam a young debt-crazed wheeler-dealer who heads home after the death of his father a poisonously self-involved Los Angeles record producer. There the family lawyer (Phillip Baker Hall) hands Sam a shaving kit stuffed with 150000. Its not for Sam. Nope. Its for Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) and Josh (Michael Hall DAddario) the half-sister and half-nephew Sam never knew he had. But instead of introducing himself in a normal honest manner Sam leaps right into LDP mode He stalks them insinuates himself into their lives and befriends them. Now Frankie is a tough chick all fishnet and cleavage but shes not so tough that she cant melt in the presence of a kind and handsome man. Which means only one thing can happen. ""People Like Us"" was penned by Alex Kurtzman Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert and marks the directorial debut of Kurtzman whose previous Orci collaborations have skewed toward frenetic big-ticket sci-fi (""Star Trek"" ""Cowboys amp; Aliens""). Going small for his first time at the helm was an admirable choice but theres small and then theres tiny airless and claustrophobic. If not for the icky air of incest Pine and Banks would make one fine-looking couple. Until now I never had a problem watching Chris Pine do his thing anything even when he played that crackpot neo-Nazi with nasty teeth in ""Smokin Aces."" But watching him go through the motions of Lying Dingbat Procrastination - no matter how soulfully he does it - is a torturous thing indeed.  Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Whats His Name? Credit Touchstone Pictures/DreamWorks From People Like Us - Be Aggressive Be Aggressive Credit Touchstone Pictures/DreamWorks From two who brought us those sensitive little human dramas Star Trek and Transformers comes a sensitive decent well-crafted little drama about frailty and forgiveness. No really In his first outing as a director writer-producer Alex Kurtzman has filled in a heavily worn premise with wit heart and -- along with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert -- a lively way with ordinary speech. People Like Us begins unpromisingly with the death from cancer of a man with two families. That comes as news to his more-or-less estranged son Sam (Chris Pine) a fast-talking salesman of the kind who pumps his fist and yells ""Yes"" when sealing a shady deal. But you can tell theres more to Sam than bluster by the pain in his abundantly lashed green eyes and the blossoming stubble on his chin when things fall apart. Sam grew up in his fathers house but the two were never close. Even after hes gone Sam nurses a massive grudge against the old man -- and a smaller one against his mother an exhausted ruin played without a shred of vanity by Michelle Pfeiffer. When the family lawyer (Philip Baker Hall) hands over 150000 in cash to be delivered to a sister Sam never knew existed the angry young man tracks the mystery sibling Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) to an AA meeting in downscale Los Angeles. In a plot contrivance I wasnt sure the movie could sustain Sam keeps their kinship to himself worming his way into Frankies life by way of her precocious troubled young son played by Michael Hall DAddario a feisty little man whose kewpie lips throaty rasp and dont-mess-with-me stare reminded me bizarrely of Cher. Rather improbably for a recovering lush Frankie works in a bar and like many movie single mothers she comes dressed as if shes trying to rattle the cages of the entire Harper Valley PTA. i Sam also spends time reconnecting with his estranged mother Lillian played with total lack of vanity by Michelle Pfeiffer. Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures Sam also spends time reconnecting with his estranged mother Lillian played with total lack of vanity by Michelle Pfeiffer. Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures But shes a good parent and a stand-up person and theres a lot to like about this prickly toughie not least because Banks dances so nimbly from funny to forlorn to corrosively bitter. Inevitably Sam and Frankie will learn that they have more in common than they thought possible. People Like Us breaks no new emotional ground and perhaps theres little to say about ruptured families except that (sorry Tolstoy) each is unhappy in its own way. Only here it really is the journey that counts. The pleasure lies in the movies long meander to reconciliation and domestic realignment observed from the heart and with a low-key attention to detail. The phantom family is a common-enough Hollywood premise but aside from the hoary old evil-twin gambit sibling stories are often dismissed as a poor sell in part because they pretty much rule out sexual possibility. People Like Us does pause -- briefly but without coyness or insinuation -- to consider the erotic confusion between two attractive people only one of whom knows they have a blood tie. Mostly though Frankie and Sams growing closeness speaks eloquently to the yearning many of us have to close a gap with an estranged brother or sister. Beyond that the emotional terrain of People Like Us encompasses the loneliness of the only child and to the undying fantasy of the perfect parent so many of us feel cheated of even when our fathers and mothers turn out to have done their limited best. How that fantasy resolves for Frankie and Sam may be fairly standard procedure. But along the way to reconciliation People Like Us does what pop culture does best which is to give a face and voice to the common hurts and losses of life and offer them to us to share.

By JOY TIPPING jtippingdallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 28 June 2012 1249 PM Updated 28 June 2012 1249 PM Related Dont stay out of the loop Keep up with us on Twitter and Facebook Its been so long since weve seen a really good family-centered drama that I had to rack my brain to remember what it was (The Descendants released last November). Seems like with at least three or four new movies every week thered be more stories about situations that could actually happen -- but far-out comedy action and comic-book sagas rule the Hollywood roost.So its a true pleasure when something as finely made emotional and beautifully acted as People Like Us comes along. Its a movie thats in a league with films from the golden age of family drama stories like Ordinary People and Kramer vs. Kramer although Peoples dashes of comedy render it far less grim than those examples.In addition to the graceful direction and script by Alex Kurtzman the movie boasts knockout performances from Michelle Pfeiffer Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks. Its likely to send Pine and Banks into another level of paychecks the kind reserved for the ""serious"" actors who can be counted on for Oscar nominations; Pfeiffer of course is already there.The script written by Kurtzman with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert is loosely based on Kurtzmans real-life story of meeting a long-lost half-sister.In the film Pine portrays Sam a fast-talking deeply indebted corporate overstock salesman (his specialties are last years kitten calendars and baby formula past its sell-by date). When his estranged father dies he tries to miss the funeral by ""misplacing"" his ID and being denied flying privileges but his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde also excellent) saves the day to his dismay.They miss the funeral anyway and arrive late at the family homestead. Sam is greeted by his mother (Pfeiffer) with a furious slap. In one of the films many moments that flawlessly crystallize contradictory ""I love you I hate you"" familial feelings she follows the hit with ""The linens are in the closet upstairs. Im glad youre home.""Sam soon finds out that his music-producer father -- ""he gave Elvis Costello his first pair of ugly glasses"" -- has left a secret 150000 legacy in the care of an attorney. Sams thrilled -- thatll seriously help reverse his debt spiral -- till he finds out that its meant for a nephew he didnt know he had. Nephew Josh is the son of Sams half-sister Frankie (Banks) who is the product of Sams fathers long-term secret affair.Sam dallies with keeping the money himself but then decides to get to know Frankie and Josh (Michael Hall DAddario an amazing pre-teen actor). Frankie appreciates the attention to her and her boy and starts to fall for Sam not knowing that hes actually her brother. Tension as you might imagine abounds.Pine and Banks play the off-kilter chemistry superbly as the story leads to the horribly fraught denouement as both characters reconcile losing an absentee father with finding a sibling who might believe it or not stick around for the long haul.PEOPLE LIKE US(A-) Directed by Alex Kurtzman.

(Zade Rosenthal) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 28 2012 118 PM Title People Like Us Film Info With Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Michelle Pfeiffer. A guy meets the sister he didnt know he had. Director Alex Kurtzman. (155) PG-13; Language drug use. Area theaters. Sam Harper is a fast-talking New York salesman with money and soul problems and the way Chris Pine plays him in ""People Like Us"" you either want to hit Sam or help him out. Which means the film is doing something half-right. A standard movie type -- think Jack Lemmon in ""The Apartment"" Tom Hanks in ""Nothing in Common"" Hugh Grant in ""About a Boy"" or Tom Cruise in ""Rain Man"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" -- Sam is into avoidance. When he gets news that his father a once-famous music producer has died Sam does all he can so he and his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) can skip the funeral. But once hes in L.A. to deal with his bitter mom (Michelle Pfeiffer) Sam is handed a bag of cash his dad left for him. Itd be a life-saver if he didnt have to deliver it to a mystery woman and her 11-year-old son. That the woman Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) is messed up too is no surprise in a dramedy like this. Nor is the bond that develops between Frankies son (a good Michael Hall DAddario) and Sam over music and guy stuff. Whats unexpected is how long the movie draws out its twist -- Frankie is Sams half-sister also ignored by their free-livin dad -- without being as bad as it could have been. You can see Sams brand of gotta-prove-myself drive in director Alex Kurtzman who co-wrote the movie with Roberto Orci. The pair penned some of the last decades biggest action blockbusters including two ""Transformers"" flicks and 2009s great ""Star Trek"" reboot. Kurtzman it seems is also seeking to prove he can be a person like us. While such desperate strivings work against the movie eventually it wins us over if the music of second chances appeals to you. Pine (aka the new Capt. Kirk) is the right front man. Sam has to appear to be a good-looking shell wholl shill for anything except authenticity and Pine has that earnest slickness down. Its an effective performance; if you dont buy him youll tune out the heart ""People Like Us"" really wants us to know it has. Banks an appealingly vinegary actress who hasnt caught fire in movies is also good though Frankies working-class life requires more ""acting."" Pfeiffer too must work with a character Kurtzman Orci and co-writer Jody Lambert dump a lot of angst on wisely defusing it with the same kind of laid-back sarcasm she had 20 years ago in ""The Fabulous Baker Boys."" ""People Like Us"" could have used more of that letting these people stand still long enough to be interesting instead of rushing them towards us. But its hard sell wears you down and draws you in even as you know youre being manipulated. Magic Moment Sam immerses himself in his late dads music marijuana and memorabilia.

Its dramatic arc is predicated on the problem of accidental incestuous attraction. Egads. You know nothing will actually happen because this is a Disney movie not a dreamy art film (like say Rebecca Millers The Ballad of Jack and Rose) but the whole movie marches toward the horrible moment when one of two newly acquainted half siblings the more sympathetic one will make a pass at the other and be rebuffed. Its hideously compelling like being in the room when one woman asks a woman who isnt pregnant when shes due except that exchange is typically over in 30 spectacularly awful seconds and this one lasts two hours. Sleazy and ambitious Sam Harper (Chris Pine) a professional barterer who trades surplus goods deliberately arrives in Los Angeles too late for his fathers funeral. Sams mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is chilly; after a childhood of being blown off by his father Sam returned the favor when his father was dying of cancer. All he inherits from Jerry an artistically successful (although less so financially) music producer is his collection of vinyl. His dads lawyer (Philip Baker Hall bestowing his usual gravitas on the proceedings) also gives him a shaving kit. Its stuffed with cash 150000 and a letter inside directs Sam to deliver it to a Los Angeles address which turns out to be that of the half sister Sam never knew he had. The pronoun in the title should have been Him instead of Us because single mom Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) looks just like Sam blonde blue-eyed chiseled features although Sam doesnt catch on to the resemblance immediately. Puzzled as to the connection to his dad he takes advantage of the Melrose Place-style open plan at her apartment complex to eavesdrop then follows Frankie to a church basement where she waves Jerrys obituary in the air and conveniently spills her story of childhood abandonment--and her connection to Sam--to a basement full of fellow Alcoholics Anonymous members. Sam is captivated by this new sister a wheeler-dealer whose sharp tongue and tough exterior masks deep childhood pain and resentment; shes just like him. (READ About Chris Pines excellent Captain Kirk in the Star Trek reboot just in time for Fathers Day) Without once identifying himself by last name or shared gene pool Sam spends the next week or so making the single mom and her 11-year-old son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario in a performance right out of the young Tatum ONeals playbook) a needy little punk fall for him. He could just walk away with the money which he needs since his dicey career has landed him in trouble with the Federal Trade Commission and his boss (Jon Favreau who shows up for one scene). But his intentions to take it and run are thwarted. Hes drawn to his female mirror image but not sexually. He wants a sister and that--despite the secrets and lies--is sweet. Like Jerry Maguire hes a sleaze in search of a soul and Frankie even more neglected by and angry with their father completes him. Pine is carving out a cocky young Tom Cruise-style niche for himself; in his last movie the miserable This Means War he played an almost identical persona. Hes deft at portraying callow even if his transformation into decency is harder to swallow. Banks is really very good in the role of Frankie. Shes fierce and smart and intensely watchable. (As always. She lifted What to Expect When Youre Expecting out of the muck every time she appeared and gave the implausible Russell Crowe vehicle The Next Three Days its pulse.) Frankie is confused by the weird attentions of this guy who takes her out for tacos and asks probing questions about her life but also flattered. She makes a living as a bartender at the Standard Hotel but shes having a hard time managing her mini-juvenile delinquent who is always in trouble at school. Sam fosters her kids interest in music (he buys Josh London Calling the first time they meet) and stocks her refrigerator with groceries. Pine looks like a Ken doll whose forehead was elongated during a toddler tug-of-war but from the eyes down its all good so who can blame lonely Frankie for being attracted to this sympathetic guy? He even pretends to be an alcoholic. (READ About Elizabeth Banks in The Next Three Days review) People Like Us has decent even witty dialogue a strong sense of place (Los Angeles from Laurel Canyon to Neptunes Net feels like another character). A neat little ending stitches time and history together very neatly and poignantly although the viewer is unlikely to let go of their negative feelings about dad Jerry Harper. If only director Alex Kurtzman who shares a screenplay credit with his Star Trek co-writer Roberto Orci as well as Jody Lambert hadnt boxed himself into this corner. Essentially this is the same set up as the stereotypical romantic comedy where one party withholds a secret while the clueless one gives away his or her heart--only the looming revelation is not ""Im the hotel maid/your business rival/journalist who writing a hit piece on you"" but ""uh Im your brother so maybe lets not kiss."" Theyre relying on the misunderstanding for drama but because they dont want anything to seem too weird theyve given Sam a girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) who is across the country for most of the movie. Shes the audiences reassurance that however weird it starts to seem with Sam and Frankie this isnt that kind film. But theres plenty of potential here without this false drama. As You Can Count on Me demonstrated the brother and sister dynamic is fertile territory. A sibling you didnt even know you had? Even richer. Instead of dragging out the revelation why not spend some time showing how Sam incorporates Frankie into the family? Pfeiffer is lovely in the scenes she does have but shes underused; why not throw her character into the room with the love-child? Sparks would fly but they wouldnt be the kind that make you feel queasy.

They come quick courtesy of a blown trade and a sudden death. People Like Us Fair Director Alex Kurtzman. Cast Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Michelle Pfeiffer. Rating PG-13 for language some drug use and brief sexuality. From the get-go ""People Like Us"" is a melodrama on a mission to teach its cast of broken characters about whats really important in life. Its a soapy predictable ride where everyone learns about the importance of family. And though its just a Christmas tree away from being a holiday special the stellar cast wrings just enough genuine emotion out of a stale premise to make it mostly sweet. Chris Pine director talk People Like Us After having lost a large commission he was relying on to absolve his considerable debt Sam comes home to his unrealistically perfect girlfriend (played prettily by Olivia Wilde) to find that his father has died. Sam is such a scamp that he tries to sabotage his flight from New York back home to California in order to miss his fathers funeral. Its around this point you start to wonder how you can stand to spend a couple of hours with this guy but even at his most smarmy Pine exudes charm to spare. At home he finds his widowed mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) a tight woman bristling with bitterness. He also finds his fathers old shaving kit stuffed with 150000 in cash along with a handwritten directive. No the money isnt for Sam though he badly needs it; its for a woman named Frankie (Elizabeth Banks) and her 11-year-old son Josh. Cowed by his morally superior girlfriend into not pocketing the cash Sam cases Frankie a haggard single mother and bartender. Is she a mistress? Something on the side? Secret half-sister it turns out. Sams world is rocked. So rocked that when he follows Frankie to an AA meeting he pretends to be just any old fellow addict who happens not to be related to her by blood. They bond becoming fast friends over tacos and conversation. Frankie was devastated when her father walked out of her life and shes still picking up pieces from the wreckage. Sam continues to see her bonding with her son not telling the truth about their connection or the money. The ruse gets increasingly awkward as the film drags on and adopts the flow of a romantic comedy. Its all fun and games until someone unwittingly tries to commit an act of incest. Meanwhile Sams girlfriend wisely jets his mother grows increasingly hostile and the Federal Trade Commission starts breathing down his neck. Can he just return to his old life in New York knowing what he knows? The dramatic contrivances that take Sam on his journey to self-realization are hackneyed but this winning cast gives it their all occasionally elevating the stale material to emotionally satisfying heights. The dead father haunts the film an invisible character orbited by all the people he has ruined along the way. The selfish son the abandoned daughter and the widowed wife all reel in obvious patterns but they do so with grace. Endearing even at its most soft-headed ""People Like Us"" is a popcorn flick for the big-hearted. Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

"People Like Us Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Surprise A family reunion in People Like Us  People Like Us Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Crisco-slick director and co-writer Alex Kurtzmans""People Like Us""brings up the vague-sounding but crucial question of approach and how a filmmakers attack on a story lives or dies with a thousand separate choices.But first the plot cooked up by Kurtzman and writing partner Roberto Orci along with their friend Jody Lambert. ""People Like Us"" is about a monumentally selfish and closed-off character Sam all mouth and emotional defenses. Sams shady sales business which the movie bends over backward to explain in the opening scenes keeps him hustling one step ahead of the Federal Trade Commission. Then life throws the curve and Sam receives news that the father he barely knew an LA music producer has died. Sam and his girlfriend arrive in time for the tail end of the post-funeral gathering at Sams old house owned by his guarded and wary mother.And then? Sam learns that his father fathered another child a girl -- Sams half-sister who is now grown and a recovering alcoholic with a dangerously rudderless 11-year-old son. Sam receives a satchel containing 150000 earmarked for the relatives he never knew he had. Sam and half-sister Frankie meet. Sam begins shadowing his troubled nephew. And up until the 90-minute mark ""People Like Us"" dances around in circles contriving reasons mostly emotional some practical why Sam would keep the big news a big secret for an ill-advised amount of screen time. (When finally delivered by Sam the beans-spilling moment got a hearty ""THANK YOU"" from one member of a Chicago preview audience.) A fine and moving film could be made from this story which was inspired loosely by events and situations in the lives of Kurtzman and Orci. But the script sets an awfully low bar for Sams redemption All he must do is not keep the money for himself and to learn to say ""I love you"" and to generally be less of a punk.Many I suspect will find the films climactic assault on the tear ducts effective. But in his debut feature outing as a director Kurtzman -- whose producing and/or writing credits with Orci include the frantic thriller""Eagle Eye""and the""Transformers""pictures -- hammers every scene and eye blink with a heavy hand. This film is shot and edited like a second-rate tent-pole action picture. A key moment early on in which Sams mother hauls off and slaps his face becomes a nerve-jangling five-shot sequence pushy and false. Why? Why shoot it that way?Chris Pine portrays Sam; Elizabeth Banks Frankie; Michael Hall DAddario the preteen wiseacre Josh; and Michelle Pfeiffer brings a weary ex-groupie glamour to Sams mother Lillian. Pine has considerable presence and tons of promise though playing a relatably dislikable fellow often hes just dislikable. In the""Star Trek"" reboot (which Kurtzman and Orci wrote) Pine brought a piercing Shatnerian intensity to every looming close-up. That same quality is a bit much for the parameters of this story and Kurtzmans technique behind the camera has the effect of crowding the performers.Banks and Pfeiffer fare the best by focusing on directness and simplicity. A particularly sharp scene between Pfeiffer and Pine in which they smoke a joint and loosen up their defenses high up in the Hollywood Hills stands in stark relief to the rest of the film. Not even the egregious soundtrack which never gives anybody or anything a moments rest can wreck it. Kurtzman has learned much about how to engineer a blockbuster and how certain cuts lighting music cues etc. can. With a story this size and shape the engineering is entirely different more instinctual less tightly calibrated.

Share Tweet Viewers who dislike movies in which all drama hinges on one character withholding information from another for no reason beyond the need to keep the plot chugging along should stay far away from People Like Us. The film does have its charms but getting to them means seeing past a Buick-sized contrivance. The directorial debut of Alex Kurtzman--who forms with People Like Us co-writer Roberto Orci half the screenwriting team behind everything from the Transformers films to the Star Trek reboot to Fringe--the true-life-inspired film stars Chris Pine as a fast-talking wheeler-dealer first seen explaining to a potential client how barter is ""the new money."" Hes good at what he does but his confidence and unflappable attitude suggest a man in dire need of a Rain Man-like soul-shaking. He gets it in the form of a double whammy. In the course of a single day he learns he has to perform an impossible make-good on a botched order to avoid a client turning him over to the FTC and that his estranged father a hard-living L.A. music producer has died. The first development troubles him more than the second at least on the surface. At the insistence of girlfriend Olivia Wilde Pine travels to California for the funeral taking up residence in the patchouli- and vine-laden Laurel Canyon home of his distant mother (Michelle Pfeiffer good as always) and burrowing into his own bitterness when he learns his father left him only a collection of classic LPs. Then he learns theres another bequest a wad of money and instructions to take it to the downscale apartment home of the recovering alcoholic half-sister (Elizabeth Banks) and shaggy-haired nephew (Michael Hall DAddario) Pine never knew he had. In the patience-trying drama that follows Pine befriends Banks and her son first by striking up a conversation at an AA meeting then by showing up and hanging out with her and the kid. For a while he keeps his true identity a secret as he theoretically considers keeping the cash for himself. Not since The Lucky One--which admittedly wasnt that long ago--has a movie tried to wring so much drama out of a character keeping his mouth shut so its to Pine and Banks credit that they almost make it work. Both play their hyper-verbal characters as overcranked and overcaffeinated people who have built up layers of defenses to deal with the many ways the world has beaten them up over the years. Though they were raised apart the family resemblance is unmistakable and the real drama of the film comes from each characters reluctant moves to lower those defenses. Kurtzman overstylizes some scenes--a flaw he shares with many first-time directors given a decent budget--but has the good sense to get out of his casts way most of the time. They bring heart to material that otherwise moves to assembly-line rhythms as it pushes Pines character toward a redemption thats too obviously his for the taking the moment he decides not to keep his mouth shut.

Chris Pine acting with itchy self-regard plays a hustler who learns that his late dad (a fabled Laurel Canyon record producer) had a secret life -- an illegitimate daughter he helped raise then abandoned. Shes played as a troubled adult by Elizabeth Banks who seems to grow with every role. The movies central situation is all too plausible. So wheres the fakery? Its there in the characterization of Banks floppy-haired brat of a son (Michael Hall DAddario) whos got the perfect line for every occasion in a way that no human child does. Its there in how Pine neglecting his girlfriend (Olivia Wilde) latches onto Banks and comes to care about her -- but no way is he going to reveal that hes her half brother because that secret is the motor that ""drives"" the film. Its there in the use of vinyl albums as signifiers of integrity. For all that Pine and Banks are just good enough to suggest that in an honest movie they would have been even better.

"People Like Us (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review People Like Us (PG-13) The directorial debut of screenwriter Alex Kurtzman (""Transformers"") is his most preposterous movie to date. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/27/2012 Editor rating 1 Alex Kurtzman has written movies about giant robots from outer space (Transformers) cowboys and aliens (Cowboys amp; Aliens) runaway clones (The Island) and Zorro (The Legend of Zorro). But he has never written one as preposterous as his directorial debut People Like Us an irritatingly contrived drama in which a man (Chris Pine) discovers he has a half-sister (Elizabeth Banks) and proceeds to creep-stalk her and her 11-year-old son instead of just telling them who he is. Why doesnt he just come clean? The script which Kurtzman co-wrote with his frequent collaborator Roberto Orci contorts itself to come up with excuses. Sam (Pine) is a hotshot New Yorker on the verge of losing his job who flies home to L.A. after his estranged father dies. He makes a point of arriving too late for the funeral which causes his mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) to fume about his passive-aggressive ways. Sam does hang around long enough to get his share of the inheritance His old mans vinyl record collection which is pretty extensive but still. He is also bequeathed a shaving kit stuffed with 150000 and instructions to deliver it to Frankie (Banks) a recovering alcoholic raising a kid (Michael Hall DAddario) on her own. Will Sam take the money and run back to New York and his beautiful girlfriend (Olivia Wilde)? Will he introduce himself to Frankie and compare notes on their mysterious dad and become an uncle to his nephew? Either of these options would have made for a better richer movie than the one People Like Us chooses In order to decide whether or not to hand over the cash Sam insinuates himself into the lives of mother and son. He takes a sudden and unexplained interest in the boy without raising any suspicions and he unintentionally leads Frankie on until she falls for him because why else is this stranger we dont know being so nice to us? Do you see how colossally misguided this whole thing is? Kurtzman based People Like Us on an incident from his own life in which he ran into a half-sister he had never met by chance at a party. He approaches the film earnestly like a Cameron Crowe picture and he has cast two hugely likable actors in the hopes they would distract us from the worrisome holes of plot. Instead all I kept noticing was how Pine sports the coolest handsomest stubble since Don Johnson in Miami Vice and how Banks continues to wait for a filmmaker to put her talents to use and how Pfeiffer seems eager and ready to start acting again but between movies like this and Dark Shadows she should really consider finding another agent. This is the sort of hackneyed hollow picture in which people burst into tears as they hug and tell each other ""I love you."" Seeing filmmakers who have found great success in genre pictures step out of their comfort zone and try something different is exciting. But if this is Kurtzmans generations idea of realistic character drama then God help us all. People like us? Hardly.

People Like Us is a conveyor belt romcom about a tough tomato with a kid to raise calloused by lifes shin kicks and cynical with despair who falls in love at last with the perfect guy shes waited for her entire life unaware that hes really her brother. It sounds awful but the big surprise is that in spite of its too-obvious directorial flaws it has an emotional impact (for me anyway) I cant resist reinforced by the guileless chemistry of a perfect cast and the genuine humanity in the script. In a summer overloaded with numbing junk movies masquerading as gum-chewing blockbusters this is a rare feel-good treat that nudges the heartstrings and makes you feel optimistic about the human race. Writer-director Alex Kurtzman whose unoriginal face-slapping big-budget action programmers (Star Trek Cowboys and Aliens and the Transformers copycats) leave me colder than refrigerated leftover pizza makes his first attempt at serious filmmaking with this uneven but basically endearing look at unhappy people who learn through hard knocks and rough mistakes to look at life with new priorities and fresh perspectives. Chris Pine impossibly handsome secretly talented but totally wasted for most of his career in meaningless cookie-cutter action epics makes a giant leap forward as an actor of both range and subtlety in a new kind of role. He is Sam Harper a slick New York salesman who is having a bad day. His latest hustle has landed him in job jeopardy and before he can talk his way out of legal troubles that could lead to a criminal investigation by the Federal Trade Commission his estranged father a famous Hollywood record producer dies in L.A. Urged to attend the funeral by his pragmatic law-school fiancee Hannah (Olivia Wilde) Sam heads for JFK but misses the last plane because he left home without a photo ID arriving in L.A. so late that he misses the ceremony too incurring the wrath of his infuriated mother Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer). (Hard to believe but yes the still-beautiful superstar has now joined the ranks of aging stars relegated to playing aging parents. This one is a step up from the embarrassing mother of a werewolf she recently played in Dark Shadows.) All Sams father left him in his will is his old LP record collection and a shaving kit containing 150000 designated to be delivered to a mysterious woman named Frankie (played by Elizabeth Banks with an engaging been-around-and-seen-it-all honesty that grows on you) a single mother with a precocious 11-year-old son named Josh. Following Frankie to an A.A. meeting Sam discovers shes a recovering alcoholic and addict once a hat-check girl at the Troubadour and a Joni Mitchell wannabe who has spent a lot of troubled years in rehab with no help from her illegitimate father and now ekes out a living as a barmaid. Sam also uncovers the astonishing fact that shes a half-sibling he never knew about. He knows he should do the right thing and turn over the money but curiosity to find out more leads both mother and son into emotional areas that spiral out of control. Not knowing who Sam really is Frankie falls for him. Between endless jump cuts too much fast television-style editing and a bumpy pace that threatens to kill the films underlying sensitivity Mr. Kurtzman also fails to resist the unwise clutter of a dated falling-in-love montage (cracking crab legs in a seafood restaurant at the beach doing laundry at a Hollywood washateria posing with a motorcycle gang for laughs eating tacos learning to trust). Layer by layer secrets are revealed mysteries get solved and hearts are broken in a movie about parents and children brothers and sisters immaturity and responsibility letting go and starting over. Based on true events in the lives of director Kurtzman involving meeting an adult half-sister he never knew and of co-writer Roberto Orci a college friend whose aunt found out her own father had a secret family he didnt tell her about People Like Us is informed by real feelings uncorked like a lost bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon hidden away in a dark corner of a private wine cellar. Mr. Kurtzman is a better writer than director. One minute his movie shows a perceptive compassion for the way people talk and feel and the next minute it churns its way into conventional TV motion sickness like it is filling spaces between Cheerios commercials. Still the actors make up for any and all deficiencies. The natural chemistry between Mr. Pine and Ms. Banks more than smooths out the contrived screenplay away from the artificial--Sams refusal to tell Frankie the truth hand over her inheritance and seal her chances for a better life for her own tortured kid grows annoying--and into the direction of plausibility. Michelle Pfeiffer reveals her own mixed emotions about the secrets shes been concealing for years too young to forgive and too old to forget what it feels like to live with pain and betrayal. They work tirelessly elevating banal characters--concocted for no other purpose than stretching a perfunctory outline to meet the demands of a full-length movie--into real relationships between likeable people who redefine the limits of friends and family. rreedobserver.com PEOPLE LIKE US Running Time 115 minutes Written by Alex Kurtzman Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert Directed by Alex Kurtzman Starring Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks and Michelle Pfeiffer 3/4 Comment Filed under Alex Kurtzman Chris Pine Elizabeth Banks Family love Michelle Pfeiffer movie Movie Review Romantic Comedy Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Radiohead Transformed Madison Square Garden Into A Moon Shaped Pool Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://observer.com/2012/06/people-like-us-is-a-sibling-romcom-that-stays-all-in-the-family/,200,peoplelikeus27,peoplelikeus,com/2012/06/people-like-us-is-a-sibling-romcom-that-stays-all-in-the-family/

Jones Jr_Jones All is not in the family in People Like Us People Like Us Directed by Alex Kurtzman Youd never guess from the mushy trailer but this debut feature by Alex Kurtzman tackles a knotty family situation with intelligence and compassion. A corporate hustler estranged from his parents (Chris Pine) reluctantly returns to Los Angeles after the death of his father a lionized record producer and discovers that the old man had a secret second family; when the son tracks down his half sister (Elizabeth Banks) a single mother and recovering alcoholic he cant bear to identify himself and their growing friendship veers uncomfortably close to romance. This layer of deception only complicates further their respective resentment of the father and as the action widens to include the protagonists widowed mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) the movie develops into a painful story of one generation inflicting its selfish compromises on the next. The three leads are uniformly excellent and the strong supporting cast includes Mark Duplass and Philip Baker Hall.

Introduced in midpatter this corporate ""facilitator"" nabs inventory overages for industrial bartering purposes (""Its like being on the ground floor of money"" he coos to a client) and uses his smarmy charm as currency; Billy Wilder would have had a field day with this guy. Its also apparent that something is fundamentally broken in Sam especially when he tries to weasel his way out of attending his fathers funeral. A famous record producer Pops never gave his kid anything but posthumously a super-bitchin vinyl collection (cue super-bitchin soundtrack) and a cigar box filled with cash. The latter is intended for Frankie (Elizabeth Banks)--a bartender whos as bitter and adept in lobbing screenwriterese screwballs as Sam is. Which isnt surprising given that shes the illegitimate sister he never knew he had. It isnt spoilery to say that these two banterers bond even though Sam keeps their relation secret or that Frankies son (Michael Hall DAddario) finds a desperately needed father figure in this sympathetic stranger--or even that a whole lot of healing will happen before the end credits. Thats how Movies Like This work so its just a question of how deftly screenwriter-turned-director Alex Kurtzmans debut feature can emotionally manipulate you before the narrative house of cards collapses and things go from sweet-and-sour to full-on NutraSweet. For the record the dip starts right around the halfway mark once Sams mother (Michelle Pfeiffer thrown a bone) drops a teary monologue and the best-day-ever montages begin to creep in. Along with screenwriting partner (and one of this movies co-writers) Roberto Orci Kurtzman has contributed to the Transformers Mission Impossible and rebooted Star Trek franchises and you can feel how happy he is to be dealing with scenarios that favor actual human beings over robots and aliens. The pity is that the people in People Like Us ultimately dont feel any more dimensional than the archetypes dutifully dotting his lowest-denominator multiplex fodder. Hes just picked a different set of cliches to ransack.

Daily Edition Login to download People Like Us Film Review 900 PM PDT 6/11/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Dramatic manipulation and an overworked style still allow some genuine emotion to seep through in a story about half-siblings unknown to each other. TWITTER Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks star as long-lost siblings in the ""Star Trek"" co-writers first stint behind the camera. As overcranked as it is -- the film is directed as if it were an action drama with two or three times more cuts than necessary -- People Like Us has a persuasive emotional pull at its heart thats hard to deny. Playing half-siblings with absentee-father issues and major childhood baggage who meet for the first time as adults Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks make the most of the sort of big-time emoting opportunities not normally available in their more customary action and comedy roles respectively. This intimate story of troubled young souls would have felt more honest if handled in a simpler quieter style which suggests that the influences on first-time director Alex Kurtzman from having worked as a writer and in other ways on Transformers Alias Star Trek Hawaii Five-0 and Cowboys amp; Aliens likely were more pernicious than beneficial. Still he knows where the emotional truth lies in this quasi-autobiographical material and is able to deliver it which should translate into people quite liking this DreamWorks/Touchstone/Disney entry upon its June 29 release. PHOTOS This Means War Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals ""Im the king of mistakes"" Pines Sam Harper admits and thats almost an understatement. Kurtzman and his co-screenwriters regular collaborator Roberto Orci and new one Jody Lambert paint Sam as so ethically and morally worthless that the prospect of spending two hours with this guy is initially dismaying. Professionally hes a fast-talking sales guy in New York who so badly screws up one scam that his boss (Jon Favreau in a bit) threatens to fire him and the Federal Trade Commission gets on their case. When Sams father suddenly dies in Los Angeles the creep deliberately makes himself and his girlfriend Hannah miss the plane back for the funeral (the fact that the latter is played by Olivia Wilde makes Sam seem even more odiously undeserving of sympathy) which p.o.s his mother Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer). He is bummed to learn that all hes been bequeathed by his dad a once-big Hollywood record producer is a large collection of vinyl. Rubbing it in further the dead man has left behind a shaving kit containing 150000 in bills that Sam is instructed to deliver to a certain L.A. address. Sam confirms his scumbag status by nearly keeping the cash for himself even though its earmarked for someone else -- a half-sister he never knew about. Casing her mundane apartment in his dads cherry red vintage convertible and stalking her to an AA meeting Sam learns that Frankie (Banks) works as a bartender and is a single mom with a smart but trouble-prone 11-year-old son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario); shes got a tough life worse than his. Among Sams many faults is the lack of nerve to inform Frankie who he is and how theyre connected causing an increasingly irritating charade of Sam befriending Frankie helping smart-mouthed Josh when he gets into trouble at school and encouraging his musical interests and politely behaving in a way that unintentionally leads Frankie to believe there might be a courtship going on (the fed-up Hannah has conveniently decamped back to New York). PHOTOS This Means War Film Stills Putting up with the scripts big contrivance of Sams endlessly avoiding telling Frankie the truth she needs to know becomes exasperating. But Kurtzman provides just enough solid and real stuff to maintain the interest. The sense of place and credible lived-in Los Angeles locations is very strong; the neighborhoods -- Laurel Canyon Van Nuys -- are spot-on for the important characters as are the restaurants and commercial establishments they frequent. The contrast between the new hipster L.A. place where Frankie works the Rooftop Bar of The Standard downtown and the funkier scene recalled by the dead dads old convertible and the LPs Sam totes around is vivid as is the desperation of all the characters as they try to stay above water. A sweetly melancholy backstory belongs to Sams mother a former hat-check girl at the Troubadour and one-time Joni Mitchell wannabe whos become a lingering ghost of Wonderland Avenue. Limited to playing just angry and distant in the early-going Pfeiffer ultimately is able to invest her character with poignantly rueful streaks when she shares her inner life with her son. Of course the longer Sam waits to let Frankie in on their shared paternity the worse her reaction is bound to be so shes predictably furious when she discovers what hes been withholding all along. One can feel the gears of the screenwriting calculations turning relentlessly all timed to pay off in a sentimental denouement that would have been better kept short and sweet. PHOTOS The Scene at CinemaCon 2012 Sporting fashionable stubble throughout even Pine is not charming and good-looking enough to explain why the head-on-her-shoulders Hannah would be with such a chronic screw-up at the outset. But once it becomes clear that Sam has suffered from an absent father nearly as much as Frankie has and that hes finally attempting to deal with it he becomes more comprehensible if not exactly sympathetic. Banks is best at revealing Frankies psychological shrewdness; by necessity shes become a quick read of personalities hyper-sensitive about peoples motives (especially mens) and quick to deal with adversity something with which shes all too familiar. The daughter of a rock n roll groupie she doesnt even know who Joshs father was but shes acutely aware that if she lets down her guard or her resolve shes a goner and her son with her. She can be a bit exhausting to be around but Banks makes a well-individualized character out of a familiar L.A. type. Some of the music cues sound too much like the needle coming down on just the right cut at just the right time but the soundtrack represents a dense mix of rock classics and A.R. Rahmans original score.

Genuine emotions barely win out over soapy complications in ""People Like Us"" the story of two siblings responses to their fathers death. That the brother and sister in question are total strangers reps the narrative hook of this well-intended but faintly exasperating melo-dramedy which insists on deferring the moment of truth for nearly two hours when it would take five level-headed minutes to clear everything up. Longtime writer-producer and first-time helmer Alex Kurtzman elicits effective performances from a fine cast offsetting the storys routine development to some degree. Modest B.O. awaits. The first five minutes add up to a deftly etched character study as whip-smart salesman Sam (Chris Pine) is brought low by the news that his father has died suddenly. Still resentful of his emotionally distant old man Sam reluctantly heads home to Los Angeles for the funeral accompanied by his supportive g.f. Hannah (Olivia Wilde). Hes received with a cold hard slap from his estranged mother Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) whose frustration with Sam is helpfully explained by Hannah ""Youre good at running away."" But Sam decides to extend his L.A. visit upon learning his father has left him 150000 in cash and a set of instructions for its delivery. Turns out Dad sired a daughter out of wedlock a few decades earlier which means Sam has a half-sister Frankie (Elizabeth Banks). In moderately stalkerish fashion he tracks her down and strikes up a casual acquaintance but refrains from telling her the truth about himself or the money the better for him to bond with her and her adolescent son Josh (Michael Hall DAddario) whos going through a problem-child phase. From here things could have taken an icky if interesting turn though Sam shuts that door early on by cryptically reassuring Frankie ""I swear on my life I will never hit on you -- ever."" As its title suggests the pic seeks to establish common ground between brother and sister Frankie may be a single mom and recovering alcoholic but the superficially better-off Sam has unenviable financial and legal woes to deal with. Frankie may feel bitter about being abandoned by their dad at an early age but Sam knows that having him around wasnt the same as having an actual relationship with him. The story thus unfolds along traditionally therapeutic lines exploring how the siblings were shaped by their respective rotten childhoods and laying the foundation for more constructive life decisions in the future. Hanging over the relationship is Sams realization that hes eventually going to have to come clean with Frankie a prospect that should generate some suspense but instead feels conveniently delayed in order to maximize the dramatic fireworks. Sam may be the conflict-avoidant type but after a while he just seems like a waiter taking his time with the bill. Very loosely inspired by Kurtzmans own family history the screenplay (co-written with Robert Orci and Jody Lambert) is equal parts authentic and artificial. Obvious care has been taken to individuate the characters with detailed quirks and backstories particularly in the case of Lillian whose gradual coming to terms with her marital woes provides the ever-underexposed Pfeiffer with one of her meatier recent roles (she was recently seen in ""Dark Shadows""). Yet despite the effort to ground this contrived scenario in plausible everyday reality and recognizable behavior the ensuing cycle of revelations and reconciliations follows as predictable a pattern as Frankies 12-step program. If they never fully sell the situation the actors nonetheless deliver strong emotionally accessible work. Pines cocksure good looks make him ideal for the part of a golden boy who uses glibness as a defense mechanism while Banks flinty open-hearted turn gets one rooting for Frankie immediately; that she goes the entire film without falling off the wagon reps a nicely restrained touch. The leads slight physical resemblance particularly around the eyes is a plus. Pfeiffer is excellent her demeanor tightening and thawing as the situation demands and young DAddario is appealing enough in a conventional good-kid-in-need-of-a-father-figure role. A scribe-producer whose credits include such action fare as ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" and TVs ""Fringe"" and ""Alias"" Kurtzman directs in an energetic slightly disheveled style that enlivens the kitchen-sink proceedings aided by Salvatore Totinos agile lensing. Whatever its story problems ""People Like Us"" offers a fine-grained portrait of L.A. living showing an ease and familiarity with the citys geography paying subtle attention to such details as how the characters drive and ensuring that Sam and Frankie have at least one important exchange at a taco stand.
