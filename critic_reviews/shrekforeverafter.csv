Shrek ends up in a parallel universe after tiring of the monotony of both fatherhood and local celebrity. In his current life no one is scared of him and busloads of tourists peer at the swamp home he shares with wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and their cute green babies. So Shrek goes awol and bumps into a wandering little guy called Rumpelstiltstkin.As fairy-tale fans will know Rumpelstiltskin specialises in tricksy contracts. So when Shrek drunkenly signs an agreement to be a real ogre for a day in return for just one day of his life he doesnt realise the catch. Suddenly Shrek is thrown into a world in which ogres are hated but Rumpel rules the kingdom hosting all-day raves with black-clad witches and routinely scamming the quivering inhabitants of a depleted Far Far Away.All very Back to the Future II and its a fun twist that allows for a fresh perspective on familiar characters. Fiona is now a warrior princess Donkey is a slave to the witches and Puss? Well lets just say hes been living the good life. The plots initially involving - and if its too complex for toddlers it compensates with humour visual invention and a 3D wow factor. This cant match the originals laugh count though and the story wears thin. Still with warmth and charm Shrek Forever After is an entertaining conclusion to the franchise - one that parents should happily endure. But lets hope thats all folks.

In 2004 Bnei Sakhnin a poorly funded northern Israel soccer club made up of Arabs Jews and foreigners won the prestigious State Cup and vaulted into the esteemed Premiere League along the way becoming a symbol of Middle East coexistence. Director Browne (A League of Ordinary Gentlemen) opens with this euphoric victory but truly trains his gaze on the subsequent year when elevated expectations internal bickering and mounting losses threatened to sabotage the squads potential for fostering harmony in the hostile region. Throughout the teams struggles on the pitch generate tension but the films most potent conflicts are off the field whether it be captain Abbas Suans attempts to live up to his nation-healing responsibility or the way in which Arab and Jewish fans are drawn to root for their own. The resulting portrait is a cautionary rejoinder to typical sports-movie uplift elucidating how athletics remain a dangerously precarious foundation upon which to construct lasting peace. (Nick Schager) (Music Hall) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - KITES Indian-made and trilingual in Hindi Spanish and English Kites is set and was mostly shot in the American Southwest -- although in its backlit visual overkill complete with neon reflected in rain-drenched streets it more closely resembles some of the most overwrought Hong Kong gangster romances of the late 1980s. Jay (Hrithik Roshan one of Hindi cinemas most engaging leading men) rolls off a freight train with a gaping bullet wound and a lot of backstory to unload. A con artist not as amoral as he thinks he is Jay makes the mistake of falling hard for Natasha (Barbara Mori) the fiancee of a spoiled young Sin City prince of crime setting up an impossibly beautiful lovers-on-the-run scenario that director Anurag Basu shoots like a series of windswept fashion videos. Even with the lights of the Vegas Strip forming a gauzy halo behind his tousled head Roshan is a master at low-keying his enormous charm and shrugging off his blinding handsomeness. Mori a Mexican telenovela star is almost a match for him Shes a dead ringer for Megan Fox but warmer less calculating in her sexiness. Not even the incoherent mishmash of plot (mostly faux Leone by way of Tarantino and Rodriguez with periodic car-flipping chase sequences) can entirely dim the appeal of this match-up between a blue-eyed Punjabi and a blue-eyed Mexican of almost equal comeliness. Kites will be released Stateside both in this original 130-minute subtitled version and in a shorter dubbed ""remix"" prepared by noted Bollywood aficionado Brett Ratner. You have been warned. (David Chute) (Beverly Center Culver Plaza Fallbrook)PRINCE OF PERSIA THE SANDS OF TIME Prince of Persia The Sands of Times story hinges on a dagger that can rewind time a narrative conceit that doubles as a taunt to those who endure this cacophonous frivolous adaptation of Ubisofts Arabian Nights-themed video-game series. Bruckheimered to the hilt with the same rollicking period-piece cheesiness that typified the producers (and studio Disneys) Pirates of the Caribbean franchise this Aladdin-indebted summer spectacle charts the efforts of noble prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) to clear his name after hes fingered for his fathers assassination a mission aided by a feisty princess (Clash of the Titans beauty Gemma Arterton) and a magic blade that fueled by divine sand gives those who wield it the ability to travel one minute back in time. Though too sweet and amicable a presence to radiate genuine ass-kicking machismo Gyllenhaal carries out his heros parkour derring-do with proficiency but director Mike Newell is ill-suited to steward such sword-and-sandals adventure. Bogged down by more leaden ripped-from-the-headlines allusions than this flippant fable can withstand most courtesy of a hammy Alfred Molina its merely a cash-my-paycheck-dammit film embodied by a disinterested Sir Ben Kingsley whose bald head and jet-black goatee position his stodgy scoundrel as a mini-me Ming the Merciless. (Nick Schager) (Citywide)SEX AND THE CITY 2 Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old and frankly I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering mincing hair-tossing eyelash-batting little-girl shtick shes been pulling ever since L.A. Story. While her BFFs struggle on with work-life challenges (Miranda) child-care dilemmas (Charlotte) and cougar body maintenance (Samantha) Carrie Bradshaw carries the movies big-ticket question How do you hang on to your marital bling once the newlywed bliss is over especially if you dont want children and your husband has turned into a homebody? Why talk it to death in ever-decreasing circles of inconsequential angst then head for Abu Dhabi. There await the four Fs -- fashion food furnishings and fornication -- plus scads of cringe-making Middle Eastern stereotypes wrapped in a nominal shout-out to oppressed Arab women who guess what like Versace and suffer from hot flashes just like us. Having raked in 400 million for the first SATC Michael Patrick King can write his own ticket which may explain why SATC2 runs a crushing 146 minutes of not very funny gag lines wrapped in episodic miniscenes that generate more embarrassment than sympathy. I get that ""dignity be damned"" is some kind of feminist mantra for King. But its one thing to create pop icons as beloved as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern were in the late 1970s. Its quite another to drag them well into middle age dress them like mutton passing as lamb and lumber them with female troubles culled straight from the mommy and single-lady blogs.

Sep. 13 600pm SHREK FOREVER AFTER In this fourth and final installation in the Shrek franchise our green hero feels emasculated by the grind of domesticity (marriage fatherhood) and worn down by the demands of celebrity. His failure to realize that his is indeed a wonderful life leads him to utter a wish for just one day to cavort in his old life of swampy bachelorhood. The wish is granted by the conniving Rumpelstiltskin whose enforcement of contractual fine-print lands Shrek in a brutal parallel universe in which Rumpelstiltskin rules the kingdom of Far Far Away with an army of witches as his muscle. There Fiona (in Xena mode) leads an underground resistance movement Donkey has no memory of Shrek but still steals almost every scene hes in and an obese Puss walks away with whatever scenes Donkey doesnt. It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in and when it does it largely retreads formula ironic use of pop standards musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs risque one-liners. By the middle of the second act Forever After finally finds its groove becoming mildly amusing (the actors -- Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas -- are in fine form) but never rising to the inspired heights of the original. And the 3-D effects are so weak as to bring nothing to the table. (Ernest Hardy) (Citywide)SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD The sixth installment in George A. Romeros long-running horror serial (est. 1967) follows Sarge Crockett (Alan Van Sprang) as he leads his gone-rogue unit of National Guardsmen from the zombie-pestilent mainland to ""Plum Island Delaware."" There the returned departed are feuded over by two family-armies led by Irish patriarchs. Once ashore the island seemingly preserved in the 1880s Romero piles on plotlines and Western tropes six-shooters an Anthony Mann Oedipal ranch hand a bona fide scalping and a homo-flirty mentor-student rapport between Van Sprang and Devon Bostick an orphaned teen he picked up. Bosticks character allows 70-year-old Romero to continue his uncomprehending fascination with gadget-addicted Millennials talking about things ""on the Net"" which made Diary of the Dead excruciating assurance that Survival could only possibly be the second-worst Dead movie. Romeros own embrace of new technology includes silly CGI violence like a noggin blown clean away leaving the scalp to plop on the neck stump or zombie eyeballs sproinging out of sockets like novelty glasses. The script reunites the writer-directors familiar preoccupations with the family-as-hell creeping Catholicism and stock rednecks. The inevitable all-you-can-eat orgy of zombies pulling stringy mouthfuls away from red wet rib cages may satisfy gorehounds but big set pieces showing how atrophied Romeros cutting and tactical framing have become is depressing to anyone who has valued his films for more than just splatter.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Shrek Forever After amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << MacGruber Supernova >> Shrek Forever After Side by side the four Shrek films look like the stages of man. You have Shrek as ogre Shrek as husband Shrek as daddy and now Shrek as George Bailey. This bracing last installment redeems the franchise from the potty joke mire of Shrek the Third with a plot that some parents will deem too dark for children forgetting all the wicked joy they took from Labyrinth. At stake is the existence of Shreks three babies and the ogre himself (Mike Myers)--in a fit hes signed away the day he was born in a foul deal with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn). Director Mike Mitchell loves burping ogre tots but he doesnt shy away from the idea that a parent might wish their kids would vanish at least for a while. Shreks child-less alternate universe is barren and cruel. Ogres are being persecuted by Rumpelstiltskins witch minions and Eddie Murphys Donkey is their slave. As ever the best lines belong to Murphy and Antonio Banderas Puss in Boots--as Shreks gotten domesticated hes gotten dull--but surprisingly the heart of the story belongs to Cameron Diazs Fiona. Without her rescuer shes ""rescued herself"" and storms around like a bitter ogre warrior princess who thinks love is a fairy tale. Make no mistake her story arc isnt astonishingly deep but shes at least given a sincere shake and daughters could do worse than to see a powerful female character owning her own destiny. Shrek the Final Chapter drags at the beginning rushes at the end and yet I spent most of the running time rooting for it to succeed. I could do without the witches breakdancing to the Beastie Boys and I could definitely do without a fifth ogre navel-gazer but the DreamWorks team has bought back enough good will that Ill check back in with the clan when the Puss in Boots spinoff springs into theaters next year.

He had every reason to be happy having made a snug home for himself with his adoring ogress-wife and their three cooing ogrettes. Yet he felt dissatisfied. He was sure he had lost his mojo. He longed for the olden days ""when villagers were afraid of me and I could take a mud bath in peace ... back when the world made sense."" As sometimes happens with domesticated animated ogres he suffered a midlife crisis and foolishly made a deal with a short vindictive wizard known as Rumpelstiltskin agreeing to swap one day from his infancy for one day of feeling like a monster again -- shrieking thudding around watching the children scatter. But in the land of milk and franchises nothing ever goes according to plan. Especially not for Shrek (Mike Myers) he of the zaftig build and Scottish accent whose rumbling return in the fourth and final film to bear his name -- and the first in 3-D -- takes him to much drearier places than hed ever been before. Shrek Forever After wanders far far away from the infectious and propulsive zing that weve come to expect over the past nine years. Instead it thrusts Our Hero into a gloomy-tunes alternate universe where Rumpelstiltskin is an ogre-oppressing despot and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) wont give Shrek the time of day. There isnt much sweetness and light in the resultant film and not many belly laughs either -- although Shrek does meet up with alterna-versions of his old friends Puss (now bootless and fat but voiced with the usual grandiloquence by Antonio Banderas) and Donkey (still Eddie Murphy still belting out mediocre pop songs). This being DreamWorks the computer animation is dynamic and imaginative no less so for being cast in duskier hues. But the plot cuts closer to dystopian sci-fi than buoyant family cartoon and Shrek is dragging around some awfully heavy psychological baggage for an ogre. ""I didnt know what I had until it was gone"" he mewls to Donkey his existential crisis nicked whole from Its a Wonderful Life. Rumpelstiltskin on the other hand is a joy to behold a totalitarian psychoneurotic gnome for the ages. Voiced by Walt Dohrn like Jason Lee on helium he sports the shoes of Aladdin and the head of an ignited road flare. (Heat Miser called from The Year Without a Santa Claus. He wants his hair back.) Watching anyone on a quest for world domination is always a swell time at the multiplex and this guys no exception; unfortunately for Shrek he eats the movie. Im sorry but the ogre uprising just cant compete. From the start the Shreks have had a deconstructive agenda In mashing together bits of fables and spitting them out as humor theyve applied a self-aware and thoroughly modern irony to age-old folktales that plumb the human psyches darkest urges. Theyre Grimm by definition. But this one is grimmer than usual. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Keter Manor 4x6-Foot Storage Shed for 339 + pickup at Walmart Fredericks of Hollywood Sale and Clearance Up to 77% off +...

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 21 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 21 2010 254PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Shrek Forever After Directed by Mike Mitchell Written by Josh Klausner and Darren LemkeWith the voices of Mike Myers Cameron Diaz Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas Classification PG Blockbuster film franchises like people grow old and tired. The previous entry in the Shrek series Shrek 3 lacked animation - a bad sign for any cartoon series. The problem was the title character an ogre who married a princess and became beloved and domesticated. Kind of like a lion in a petting zoo. Thats no life for an ogre. And give Shrek Forever After credit for correcting the series wayward drift with an audacious bit of film thievery. The latest and last Shrek comes to life not because it finally gives in to 3-D (although it does) but because the DreamWorks creative team has transplanted the beating heart of a 1946 film classic Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life into the series giant green carcass. The film begins with Shrek surrounded by diapered shrieking ogres. Princess Fiona his wife is suddenly full of orders. Do this. Do that. Villagers who once feared and left him alone now circle his house demanding that Shrek autograph their pitchforks. The monsters only refuge is eye-toonies - hard gin and three or four baby blues on a toothpick. Alcohol doesnt help however. ""I used to be an ogre"" Shrek complains up to the eyeballs in eyeballs ""now Im just a jolly green joke."" Up pops Rumpelstiltskin a shady wizard with a slippery contract Hell make Shrek an ogre again for a day if Shrek gives up something in return. Shrek doesnt read the fine print and - poof - finds he never existed. And so just as in Its a Wonderful Life when a kindly guardian angel shows George Bailey (James Stewart) what the town of Bedford Falls would be like without good old George we see how the Kingdom of Far Far Away fares without bad old Shrek. Ogres are being hunted to extinction by dive-bombing witches. Princess Fiona is public enemy No. 1. Donkey is a cart-pulling mule forced to sing show tunes at the end of a cracking whip. Puss in Boots is a pampered pet of the evil king Rumpelstiltskin and has become unspeakably fat - an orange sofa with claws. Shreks job is to win back his kingdom. But not before enjoying his slobs day in the sun - scaring the bejesus out of bothersome villagers and enjoying uninterrupted mud baths slurping back eye-toonies whenever he wants. All of this to the bouncy old Carpenters hit Top of the World. Its a fun moment typical of the Shrek series which has always found pleasure in fooling with unlikely pop-culture references. (Remember the presnack Gingerbread Man singing Culture Clubs Do You Really Want to Hurt Me? in the first film?) What makes the series succeed as family entertainment is that it has made these references work for two generations. For instance a frantic scene here in which witches put on a loop-de-loop air show - a sequence tweens will recognize as a parody of the Quidditch contests in Harry Potter movies. And parents will enjoy for the music a club version of English Beats throbbing 1980 hit Click Click. Its also good to hear Mike Myers (as Shrek) with something to complain about again. We will miss his slow-boiling exchanges with Eddie Murphy (Donkey) a comic partnership that compares favourably to the classic early TV pairing Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. Hell well miss Murphy. Donkey is his only part in more than a decade that allows the comedian to run his mouth at full speed. Rock critic Robert Christgau once said that you can judge box sets by the last disc in the package. In which case the inevitable Shrek box will be very good indeed. The shout line on the Shrek Forever After poster says it best It aint ogre till its ogre.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The final chapter in a constantly charming franchise ""Shrek Forever After"" proves what has been increasingly clear in the decade since the titular ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) leapt so famously onscreen from William Steigs 1990 childrens book The animated journey of Shrek his beloved Fiona and Far Far Away buddies Donkey and Puss in Boots is pitched to adults even more than younguns. Its not that kids are an afterthought. Far far from it. Wee ones are given plenty to giggle about burping ogre babies a flatulent father impossibly winning talking animals nasty villains with silly grudges and so on. But the writing has from the first sequel been rife with knowing wisecracks for parents and chaperones. With Far Far Away resembling Hollywood the double entendres -- visual as well as verbal -- have been irresistible fodder for the filmmakers. To wit ""Shrek"" influenced many pretenders that winked and nudged to lesser effect. For ""Shrek"" catering to the grown- ups makes a sort of sense. After all many adult ticket buyers were beneficiaries and victims of Grimm fairytales and Cinderella promises. Newer audience members have we hope been fed the more thoughtful literary fare. This fourth film takes the grown- up tilt further stirring an ""Its a Wonderful Life"" dilemma into an often- pleasing if familiar brew of pop-cultural nods and fairytale teases. Only instead of contemplating ending it all as George Bailey did Shrek is merely tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into having never been born. As the film opens Shrek and Fionas triplets are about to celebrate their first birthday and the big green guy is feeling dulled by the routines of marriage and parenthood. Hes become a hero to his community a beloved nice guy. Hes grown out of touch with his inner scary. Shreks cranky mood is easily exploited by Rumpelstiltskin. He tricks Shrek into giving him one day in his life -- then takes the day Shrek was born. A vortex whips Shrek into a time where ogres can still scatter the fearful. A place where his nearest and dearest know him not. ""Shrek"" story honcho Walt Dohrn gives voice to the bewigged manipulator with an off-his-meds mix of resentment and coyness. Dohrn says he took his inspiration for the bitter little fiend from Sean Penn in ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" and Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" Nice -- or appropriately not so nice. At first Shrek finds this world swell. Cue a chipper Carpenters tune for one of the franchises amusing trademark song montages. Then a new reality sets in. Long long ago in a place called Far Far Away Shrek once delivered ""true loves kiss."" Can he do that again in the topsy-turvy empire of Rumpel where witches are henchfolk and a giant quasi-disco ball hangs in the palaces grand hall? No matter which realm she inhabits Cameron Diazs Fiona remains a feisty level-headed co-hero. In Rumpels realm she leads a rebellion of ogres including a dearie named Cookie (Craig Robinson) who believes in the power of the food cart. Directed with zest by Mike Mitchell (from a script by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke) and shot in 3D this final ""Shrek"" sequel has plenty of verve. A broomstick chase through Rupelstiltskins grand digs is especially impressive. Puss (Antonio Banderas) may have lost his figure but he can still look as if hes posing for a Margaret Keane painting at will. His eyes grow bigger and sadder until hes broken the resistance of friends and audience members alike. Donkey (madly agile improviser Eddie Murphy) is as darling as ever after. Alas he also delivers the films most off-color joke which teeters wittily and wrongly on slur. The joys of this final ""Shrek"" arent original so much as sense-memory- pleasing Pinocchio the Three Little Pigs and Ginger Bread Man are all here. Yay. Did someone say ""final""? Thats a matter of debate in the pop- cultural land of never say never. In November the Broadway show ""Shrek the Musical"" is slated for the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. And come summer 2011 Puss gets his very own flick of a tale. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

It digs back to what empowered the coarse mud-bathing upstart to snatch the very first Best Animated Feature Oscar crown from its shocked and kingly Disney rival at the Academy Awards in 2001.Shreks charm has always lurked in the twist it brings to Disneys fairy tales about the beautiful princess who ends ups with a handsome prince leaving everyone to live happily ever after. In the first film inspired by the William Steig picture book the ugly ogre (voiced with irresistible Scottish crankiness by Mike Myers) falls for the beautiful princess Fiona (voiced by the beautiful Cameron Diaz) much as the Beast falls for Belle in Disneys Beauty and the Beast.Instead of Shrek turning into a handsome prince Fiona turns into a lumpy green ogre - and he finds her lovelier than before. Its all about people being beautiful because you love them as the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella song lyric goes it showed kids that what matters is who they are inside.. Movie Information Shrek Forever AfterRatingShowtimes | 3-D | IMAX | 3-D IMAX | Official siteDirector Mike MitchellStarring The voices of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas Julie Andrews and John CleeseRun time 93 minutesMPAA rating PG (mild action some rude humor and brief language)Synopsis In the fourth installment of the series Shrek fears hes lost his bark and his bite.More movies from GuideLive.comAt first Shrek Forever After threatens to tread in the cliched fields of Its a Wonderful Life as a misbegotten contract with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) gives Shrek an opportunity to see what life would be like if he had never been born. Director Mike Mitchell and screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke all relatively new to the franchise manage to lead the winning returning cast in a fresh direction.Sure Shrek doesnt rescue Fiona in this scenario; she rescues herself and goes on to lead an ogre revolution. For Shrek to get his life back he needs Fionas kiss which is what made all the difference in the earlier films. He learns the kiss means nothing without true love behind it.Theres a visual feast of fairy-tale character shtick complete with the Pied Piper and a bevy of cackling witches now offered for the first time in RealD 3D as well as on IMAX 3-D. The A-list returning cast couldnt be better too particularly Eddie Murphy as the Donkey that Shrek now has to win over (as opposed to the Donkey in the first film who forced his friendship on Shrek) and Antonio Banderas making delicious fun of his romantic leading man lineage as a Puss in Boots who has so gone to seed he cant pull up his boots without splitting them.The best part of Shrek has never been the razzle-dazzle or the size of his belly but the depth of his heart. Shreks choices as he sets out on his quest to win his strong independent ogress make us like Fiona fall for him all over again. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas Julie Andrews Justin Timberlake Jon Hamm Maya Rudolph Amy Sedaris Craig Robinson Director Mike Mitchell Release Opened May 21 2010  Editorial Review The fourth time is the charmBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 21 2010The Shrek we meet at the start of ""Shrek Forever After"" is a shell of an ogre mean and green on the outside but all mellow yellow inside. Married life and fatherhood have made him soft and no longer scary. Gone are the angry mobs who used to chase him with pitchforks replaced by some obnoxious brat at his triplets birthday party who keeps demanding ""Do the roar"" as if Shrek were just another celebrity with a worn-out catchphrase.Can this be the monster that we know and love or is he merely going through the motions catering to the clamoring crowds that want to see him do what hes always done one more time?The same thing might be asked of the movie the fourth and supposedly final chapter in the animated series. Has ""Shrek Forever After"" still got it or is it just a crass attempt to cash in on a now-tired franchise?Believe it or not theres life in the old boy yet. After a disappointing third outing this ""Shrek"" brings the cycle of fairy-tale-themed films to a fine finish.The premise itself will sound familiar. Not from earlier Shrek movies but from the 1946 ""Its a Wonderful Life."" In an attempt to get back some of his mojo if only for a day Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) finds himself in the position of George Bailey in a world in which he has never been born.Thats because he makes a magical deal with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn). Shrek gets 24 hours to live the life he used to have before fame and family came along. In return Rumpelstiltskin gets to take a day from Shreks life.Our hero should have read the fine print more carefully. Rumpelstiltskin picks the day Shrek was born meaning that while Shrek now finds himself in a world unencumbered by diapers and responsibility its also a world in which all the good hes done has had no effect. He wasnt there to rescue his wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from her tower prison. Rumpelstiltskin is now king and his kingdom is a police state run by witches who hunt down ogres and toss them in jail. Fiona is the Amazonian leader of the ogre resistance movement.Fortunately theres an escape clause If he and Fiona share one ""true loves kiss"" Shrek gets his old life back. All he has to do is make Fiona fall in love with him -- all over again. If he doesnt hell evaporate come sunrise.That much is reminiscent of the first two movies which also revolved around the power of a transformative kiss. But theres enough here thats clever and new -- and at times very funny -- to keep things from feeling stale.Many beloved old characters return only much transformed. Gingy the gingerbread man (Conrad Vernon) is now a scarred professional gladiator fighting animal crackers in an arena for sport. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is a mangy beast of burden pulling the paddy wagon into which Shrek is thrown after hes captured. Most hilariously Puss (Antonio Banderas) can no longer fit into his boots having put on well more than a few pounds as Fionas pampered pet.Among the new characters Rumpelstiltskin makes for a perfect villain. Vain insecure and ridiculous in an assortment of constantly changing wigs hes a pleasure to boo and hiss at.The Pied Piper also makes an indelible debut without ever uttering a word. Hired by Rumpelstiltskin to round up ogres he carries a high-tech flute with him -- it has settings for rats witches ogres etc. -- that makes dancers out of whatever and whomever he wants to consistently amusing effect. If you liked the episode of ""Glee"" where the football team shakes it improbably to Beyoncs ""Single Ladies"" youll love the sight of hulking line-dancing ogres.Have we heard some of this before? Sure. But as with the best fairy tales -- the ones that bear repeating again and again -- the delight in ""Shrek Forever After"" is not in the tale itself but in the telling.Contains slapsticky action and bathroom humor.

But it doesnt feel so good.       Photo (c)Paramount In ""Shrek Forever After"" the green ogre is frustrated fat cranky middle-aged depressed and bored. They could have called this movie ""Shrek the Film Critic."" But then who would pay 17.50 to see it? After the frantic spurt of fairy-tale allusions and jokes in the first three Shreks this one inches along with a few mostly pointless action scenes and the occasional mild pun. That it rips off ""Its a Wonderful Life"" isnt the core problem; its merely a symptom of the lazy screenwriting that trickles across every limp page of this fantastically boring script. The 3-D effects look terrific but Ive seen Keebler Elf commercials with more story line. A prologue takes us back to the same moment as the climax of the first ""Shrek"" when (it turns out) Rumpelstiltskin is about to trick Fionas royal parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews both wasted) into signing away their kingdom -- but he is foiled because their daughter is elsewhere experiencing true loves kiss (courtesy of Shrek) which voids the contract. The psycho Rumpel -- or Mr. Stiltskin as his henchmen call him -- schemes to trick Shrek who is bored by family life (youll quickly share the feeling after an endless sequence meant to show how monotonous his existence is) and agrees to trade away one day of his early life in exchange for one day to be free of domesticity again. Since all Shrek does in Ferris Bueller mode is roar at everyone this doesnt seem like much of a trade. (What about a trip to Ogre Vegas to flirt up some showgirls?) And Shrek is too dumb to realize that if you trade any previous day of your life it could change the present -- which becomes a Potterville-like wasteland because Rumpel took away the day of Shreks birth and now the ogre has never existed. At this point youll hear 4-year-olds in the audience muttering ""Seen it all before."" The aura of freshness on offer in this film is roughly equivalent to what youd experience walking behind Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Shrek gets to meet the beast again (yawn) then figures out that true loves kiss will void Rumpels contract again (snooze) then meets Fiona again only to discover that shes the general of an ogre army and has no time for romantic foolishness (zzzz). Only when we re-encounter Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) now a bootless fat housecat who has traded adventure for cushion-y comforts do things liven up a bit -- but the movie repeats (and repeats and milks) the pleading big-kitty-eyes gag from the second ""Shrek."" Other bits that get gnawed to death A little kid demands in a funny voice that Shrek ""do the roar"" (this is used at least five times) Rumpel keeps changing wigs and the Pied Piper he sends to capture our heroes gets everyone to do silly dances with his flute. Interchangeable witches fly around making mild mischief while Donkey and Puss say things like ""You are a cat-astrophe"" and ""Youre ri-donk-ulous."" The movies main strategy for finding laughs is (I kid you not) Lite FM. We get to hear just about all of the Carpenters ""Top of the World"" () plus characters keep busting out ""Youve Got a Friend"" (twice) Whitney Houston and Madonna. Tired? This series is as exhausted as Shrek after a day of baby wrangling and diaper changing. Just writing about the movie is making me as dozy as the back row of an eighth-grade math class on a warm afternoon. Normally there is no reason to take notice when a sequel trying to fire up some publicity bills itself as ""the final chapter.""

"Shrek Forever After movie review New life for a familiar franchise |       NJ.com comments Shrek Forever After movie review New life for a familiar franchise Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 21 2010 at 440 AM View/Post Comments Paramount PicturesFollowing in the footsteps of such colorful Shrek (left MIKE MYERS) adversaries as Lord Farquaad Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming comes Rumpelstiltskin (right WALT DOHRN)--the newest and perhaps most formidable foe to come along in DreamWorks Animations ""Shrek Forever After.""Its a wonderful life. Thats what everybody keeps telling Shrek anyway -- his wife Fiona his best friend Donkey all the happy citizens of Far Far Away. But Shrek remains unconvinced. Feeling old overworked and underappreciated Shrek is clearly having a Middle-Ages crisis. Shrek Forever After (PG) Paramount/Dreamworks Animation (90 min.) Directed by Mike Mitchell. With the voices of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas Walt Dohrn. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Three stars Ratings note The film contains some mildly vulgar humor. So when Rumpelstiltskin offers him a magic deal Shrek grabs it without reading the fine print. And if you want to know what happens next -- well just look back at that first sentence again and think ""Pottersville."" But this time with a gaggle of witches in charge and ogres outlawed. That ""Shrek Forever After"" begins with its hero worried about losing his mojo is only fitting because frankly by the last film -- the third in this series -- the movies seemed to be losing something too. What had once seemed fresh -- a fairy-tale world full of pop-culture references -- was beginning to get tired. And Shrek and Fionas triplets looked like the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Teletubbies had joined in some deeply unholy way. This fourth film though wisely gives us something new by rewriting the saga. Now we get to see what the land of Far Far Away would look like if Shrek hadnt been there to rescue Fiona from the dragons keep. And its not pretty even by ogre standards. It also provides a terrific character in Rumpelstiltskin. In a nice change of pace hes voiced not by some slumming celebrity but by a veteran animator Walt Dohrn (a veteran of ""SpongeBob SquarePants""). And Dohrn gives the furious little fellow an outsized personality (as well as some smashing wigs). The regular crew is back of course with Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz as Shrek and Fiona -- perhaps sounding a trifle bored by now with their loving but squabbling ogres. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas do wonderful jobs as Donkey and Puss though (with Murphy getting the films biggest joke -- a deliberately politically incorrect one at that). And the 3-D effects are terrific and smartly done as part of the story not as an afterthought. There are some holdovers from the last film that are less pleasant. Those ugly triplets are here although only briefly. And the use of celebrity-voice guest stars has become a crass gimmick. (What do you really get from having Meredith Vieira or Regis Philbin dub a few lines besides some free publicity on their shows?) But those are small annoyances and not too hard to overlook and by the time the film has concluded its easy to feel the whole series has come full circle. That the studio thought so too was indicated in some early ads which dubbed this installment ""The Final Chapter."" For once though I hope the filmmakers havent ruled out another sequel. As ""Shrek Forever After"" proves theres life in the big green guy yet.

Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) longs to be a real ogre again. He wants to see villagers fleeing before him in genuine terror instead of treating his home like a tourist attraction. In one of the movies better gags a plump little boy keeps insisting in a helium-inflected growl that Shrek ""do the roar."" Shrek wants not to ""do"" the roar but to really feel the roar. He wants his old life back if only for a day. This being a fairy tale albeit a modern one there is a way to make that happen -- involving a magical contract proffered by that master of fairyland deceit Rumpelstiltskin. And this being a Shrek film the resulting adventure is once again lively and clever although its creative underpinnings -- a sort of flea-market pastiche of antique fairy tales vintage vaudeville and contemporary pop culture -- seem rather more shabby than chic. When the first Shrek came out in 2001 DreamWorks use of that that same triptych of source materials liberally sprinkled with jabs at Disney seemed in and of itself original. Nine years later its hard not to notice how everything in the movie comes from somewhere else -- nicely rearranged but far from fresh. (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Preview 2010.) That said sitting down to a fourth Shrek feels no more objectionable than sitting down to the second or the third -- neither of which I recalled in any detail as I sat down to watch this one despite having seen them in the theater and then multiple times in the living room. This movie doesnt attempt as the other three did to advance Shreks life story such as it is. It appears to be driven more by capitalism than any storytelling urge and steers away from a linear narrative in order to circle back to the first movie for a sort of Its a Wonderful Life diversion in which Shrek sees what things in the kingdom of Far Far Away would be like without him. (See TIMEs dispatches from the 63rd Cannes Film Festival.) We learn in prologue that in the days before Shrek rescued his beloved Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon-guarded tower Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohm) was this close to convincing her parents to sign away their kingdom to free her. Shrek foiled the plot by saving her. Years later though Rumpelstiltskin still wants that kingdom -- and at a crucial moment in Shreks midlife crisis he shows up with a sympathetic shoulder too many eyeball martinis and a contract that offers Shrek a day to be an ogre again -- in exchange for a day from Shreks past. Shrek is too far into his cups to realize that it could be the day he was born. He is soon trapped in an alternate reality -- in this week of the Lost finale lets call it a sideways world -- in which Fiona has sprung herself from the dragons keep and blossomed into the ferocious leader of an ogre rebellion -- Joan of Arc meets Lara Croft. Donkey (Eddie Murphy still funny) is a slave to a crew of ogre-hunting wicked witches. And Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is so fat he cant fit into his boots anymore. And everything hinges -- again -- on true loves kiss. Whatever my motivation for seeing Shrek Forever After rested squarely on the shoulders of that fat cat. He was the cream I was looking for and Banderas delivers as usual. But something did interfere with the simple pleasures of a corpulent cat. The Shrek sequels have always served as handy time capsules of the pop culture zeitgeist. Just as Shrek the Third had Justin Timberlake guest-star after he brought sexy back Shrek Forever After features two recent breakthrough stars Mad Mens Jon Hamm and Glees Jane Lynch playing respectively right-hand man to warrior Fiona and a prominent wicked witch. This kind of timeliness amuses adults but rarely does anything for kids. Sending Shrek into George Bailey territory does even less for them. ""I have some confusions"" my child kept saying after attending a screening with me. Me too. I kept thinking so in sideways world Donkeys a slave Sawyers a cop Bens a school teacher and Kate claims shes innocent -- hey wait a minute this isnt Lost The timing is not the fault of Shrek Forever After; DreamWorks couldnt have known when the years most talked-about TV show would go into its final season. But that only serves to highlight one of the difficulties with the franchise -- at the end of the fourth go-round this Shrek seems so intent on being in touch with the times that it feels out of touch with itself.

"Shrek Forever After Ogre and done with | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShrek Forever After Ogre and done withShrek Forever After opening Friday in 3-D will enchant the very young but it holds less interest for adults than the three that preceded it.The fourth chapter in the Shrek franchise sees the beloved green ogres life turned upside down after he makes a pact with Rumplestiltskin.By Rob SalemTelevision CriticThu. May 20 2010Shrek Forever After (out of 4)Though maybe not as final as was initially intended. The TV commercials the posters and promotional materials the toys and the fast-food giveaways all refer to this new sequel as ""The Final Chapter"" but at some point quite late in the game the name was changed to ""Forever After"" which doesnt have quite the same conclusive ring.Mind you they could have called it Shrek The Absolute Last Time We Ever Do This Ever Again We Swear and if it did well enough at the box office or if Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy really needed the work I suspect they would find a way to recant and return the Big Green Guy to his beloved swamp.Although that is pretty much what theyve done here as a short-sighted Shrek reboots his whole life in an ill-considered pact with a power-mad Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn who sounds like Pee-wee Herman but isnt).Article Continued BelowEverything done is undone a la Jimmy Stewart in Its a Wonderful Life. Without Shreks impact on their lives the donkey (Murphy) is just a witch-slapped toadie the cat (Puss in Boots. voiced by Antonio Banderas) has become fat and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) has become an embittered hostile freedom fighter. It now requires nothing less than the retroactive destruction of Shreks idyllic family life to inject some necessary conflict back into the franchise. If you cant fix something that isnt broke your only recourse is to break it. Although the new Shrek will likely equally enchant the very young it holds less interest for adults than the three that preceded it beyond some additional pop-music cues and a couple of out-there dance numbers. There are alas significantly fewer of those wonderfully subtle in-jokes slyly aimed over the kids tousled heads.You will however note how well the new-school 3-D format is suited to this kind of minutely detailed computer-rendered animation where depth and perspective can be substantially tweaked and are not limited by the bounds of any sort of reality.I mean if Im going to spend a couple of hours with someone or something right up in my face Id rather it be a fantasy world of whimsical and endearing fairytale creatures than a war-torn jungle planet where peaceful blue-skinned aliens are being slaughtered en masse by a mercenary army.Yes there is a war of sorts being waged in the Shrek-deprived land of Far Far Away. But when its between a gang of disenfranchised ogres (including the voice of Mad Mens Jon Hamm) and Rumplestiltskins witchy minions (including Glees Jane Lynch) well that does kind of take the sting out of it.Especially when theyre dancing.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 21 2010 1201 a.m. ET At one point in ""Shrek Forever After"" the amiable hero sees his face on a poster nailed to a tree and says ""Sure is great to be wanted again."" Wanted yes but needed? Not on the strength of this fourth and presumably last installment which is enhanced within reason by 3-D. Having run its course in the third installment the franchise jogs and lurches but mostly meanders through a story that tests the limits of true love (Shreks and ours). The starting point is domesticity which isnt sitting well with Shrek at all. He has a loving wife in Fiona and three cute kidlets (plus of course the benefit of Mike Myerss endearing voice) but hes undone by doing diapers and has fallen victim to the kind of toothless fame that overtook Buffalo Bill. To reclaim his inner ogre Shrek signs a contract with Rumpelstiltskin that makes him an Ogre for a Day. But the contract dramatizes if nothing else the importance of reading the fine print. Before you can say ""Its a Wonderful Life"" Shrek is plunged into an alternate universe where he and Fiona have never met old friends like Eddie Murphys Donkey and Antonio Banderass Puss in Boots dont know him and Fiona voiced appealingly as before by Cameron Diaz has left her castle to assume command of a guerrilla army thats resisting Rumpelstiltskins ruthless rule. Watch the trailer for the movie ""Shrek Forever After."" Video courtesy of Paramount. The film which was directed by Mike Mitchell has its intermittent pleasures toy-like landscapes rendered in enchanting colors; the mysterious charm of Mr. Banderass delivery which gets laughs from every one of his lines; a spell woven by the Pied Pipers flute in a scene reminiscent of the ""Man Piaba"" sequence in ""Beetlejuice""; a witches ball followed by the witches vertiginous pursuit of Shrek through the 3-D spaces of a palace. (Its all too easy to take computer animation for granted until a set piece like that one leaves you absolutely dazzled.) But its important to read the fine print in screenplays too. This one by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke turns out to be a recycling machine that recalls the high points of previous installments without demonstrating the need for a new one. While theres some suspense in whether Shrek will be able to break Rumpelstilstskins contract with an out clause that posits the power of a loving kiss theres also a sense of filmmakers searching for whatever will help fill the running time. Ninety-three minutes isnt a long time but some of it passes very very slowly. Looking for Eric A string of reservations may not be the best start for an admiring review but I want to get them out of the way so I can concentrate on what I love about Ken Loachs ""Looking for Eric"" which is a lot. The first caveat comes attached to almost every Ken Loach film that plays to American audiences. The accents--mostly Lancashire in this case--demand and sometimes defy concentration. (This film I should note can be seen via video on demand through cable providers as well as in a few big-city theaters.) The second involves a basic plot device you either do or dont buy I bought into it quickly and happily. The third relates to an elaborate climax thats amusing in a strenuously whimsical way but tears the films dramatic fabric to tatters. ENLARGE Steve Evets as Eric Bishop and Eric Cantona as himself in Looking for Eric. IFC Films There you are then. Now let me tell you how stirring the film can be. Its title cuts two ways since Paul Lavertys screenplay involves two Erics. Eric Bishop played with phenomenal intensity by Steve Evets is a postman and soccer fanatic who lost his way three decades ago when he left Lily the young woman he loved; now hes losing it again after crossing paths with her unexpectedly. Eric Cantona played by his suave self is a French-born footballer turned actor though not just any footballer; in real life he achieved mythic status as the star of Manchester United. When the postmans co-workers see how desperate his state is they conspire to cheer him up. Eric seeks more serious guidance or inspiration from the life-size poster of Eric Cantona that occupies a place of honor on his wall and the other Eric responds by appearing magically in the flesh and dispensing life lessons couched in football terms. Thats the basic device and it cuts at least two ways as a witty parody of psychotherapy--""In Treatment"" for the soccer set--and a strangely touching expression of the bond between a worshiper and a benign deity. Quick wit is one quality that makes the film special; another is a tenderness that grows out of the postmans grief--one of his stepsons is helping to make his life a living hell--and the depth of his love for Lily who is played beautifully in the present by Stephanie Bishop. ""Looking for Eric"" is a daring and unstable melange of styles--working-class realism deadpan fantasy shameless buffoonery. At times it falls flat or fails to rise. More often than not though its a heartbreaker. In Brief ENLARGE Michael Douglas and Susan Sarandon in Solitary Man. Anchor Bay Films ""Solitary Man"" stars Michael Douglas as a vulgar womanizer--a girlizer really--and a serial lecher who uses sex to avoid the twin terrors of mortality (his heart could be a lot healthier) and personal failure (he sabotaged his career as a supersuccessful car dealer). The movie which was written by Brian Koppelman and directed by Mr. Koppelman and David Levien seems to view its antihero Ben Kalmen as a kind of upscale Willy Loman. Yet hes so dislikable and Mr. Douglass performance is so devoid of any saving nuance that you may wonder why the young women Ben hits on and the passive young man he befriends (played by Jesse Eisenberg) dont tell the aging creep to buzz off the moment he opens his mouth. ""Solitary Man"" intends to be shocking and has been rewarded with some respectful reviews. But ticket buyer beware--the films real shocker is its unpleasantness. ""Holy Rollers"" is a debut feature directed by Kevin Asch. This time Jesse Eisenberg stars as Shmuel a.k.a. Sam a young Hasidic Jew who thanks to restless ambition and boundless naivete becomes a drug courier smuggling ecstasy from Europe into the U.S. The film is said to have been inspired by a true story but the inspiration was insufficient even though Mr. Asch has a strong sense of place and displays a confident touch with some of the action sequences. The screenplay by Antonio Macia is earnest and unsurprising--not a good combination--and neither the director nor the star quite knows what to make of the quirky character inside the traditional garments that signal otherworldly innocence to customs agents. DVD Focus Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) The first Wallace amp; Gromit full-length feature a charming film from the British production team at Aardman never caught on in this country to the extent that it deserved. This time the Claymation buddies are humane pest-control experts; their company ""Anti-Pesto"" deals with a plague of rabbits by vacuuming up the little hoppers and giving them room and board. The plot such as it is confronts two problems where to keep all the rabbits and how to keep more rabbits from ravaging the produce in a Giant Vegetable Competition hosted by Lady Tottington who is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) Cillian Murphy is Damien a young physician turned guerrilla fighter after being radicalized by the brutality of British troops in the thatched-roof Ireland of 1920. The director Ken Loach and his writer Paul Laverty are unsparing in their portrait of the Black and Tans and the ruthless violence that the Republicans visit on Britains forces. Most painful of all is the spectacle of Irish revolutionists fighting Irish turncoats. ""I studied anatomy for five years and now Im going to shoot this guy in the head"" Damien says in horror and anguish. Then the physician turned guerrilla turns executioner. Maria Full of Grace (2004) A debut feature by Joshua Marston this harrowing film centers on Maria a young woman in Colombia who becomes a drug mule and flies to New York at mortal risk with heroin-filled pellets in her stomach. Shes played by Catalina Sandino Moreno a young actress trained in her native Colombia who brings flawless though mainly invisible technique to her first movie role. The drama is detailed and suspenseful though the process through which Maria learns to swallow those deadly pellets is almost too awful to watch. Mr. Marston is a natural dramatist and better still an adventurous one. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

OGLE OUR OGRE STORIES Shrek had us at once upon a time... INTERACTIVE What can we learn from Shrek? TRAILER See a snippet of Forever After To everyones delight the ogre and his pals took the fairy-tale formula on a fresh and funny adventure ride. But then the big guy fell under the sway of a midlife crisis and the whole enterprise grew muted. In the fourth and ostensibly final installment Shrek and company still have some appeal but the energy is lacking and the fun feels forced. Though Shrek Forever After has some clever lines -- notably more than in the third movie -- the pop-culture references and joyous spirit have been replaced by spurts of slapstick and contrived mania. Like many other movies lately its needlessly in 3-D. Nothing in the animated movie is enhanced by the technology unlike DreamWorks more dazzling recent effort How to Train Your Dragon. Shrek already had a distinctive storybook design and throwing in crazy dances and objects flung toward our faces adds nothing. Director Mike Mitchell (Deuce Bigalow) doesnt have the deft touch of Andrew Adamson who directed the first two in the series. Shreks fourth odyssey is a predictable remix of Its a Wonderful Life and Groundhog Day. Mostly though its a pale mash-up of previous Shreks since Shrek (Mike Myers) must re-friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and re-woo Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and revisit a lot of what went before. Shrek now the father of 1-year-old triplets is feeling domesticated and missing his formerly brutish ways. Everyone now regards his ferocity as shtick. At his childrens birthday party a bratty kid repeatedly insists that Shrek ""do the roar"" The kids obnoxious request is funny the first couple of times but it becomes less so with repetition. Fed up Shrek signs a deal with the conniving Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) which plunges the story into an alternate universe. The Machiavellian Rumpelstiltskin runs this parallel world abetted by a gaggle of witches whose voices include those of Jane Lynch and Kathy Griffin. Also new to the saga is the tuneful Pied Piper and a slew of new behemoths led by Fiona now the feisty leader of an ogre rebellion. One of those ogre voices belongs to Mad Mens Jon Hamm. But none of these distinctive vocal cadences are given much to do. Donkey continues to be lovable and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) has one of the funnier character arcs. In this edition hes not a dashing swashbuckler but a fat and pampered housecat. As always Banderas renders the feline a hilarious scene-stealer. But when writers Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke run out of humorous dialogue they resort to montages of witches break-dancing and ogres grooving. At points the narrative structure slips sidestepping its internal logic. Shrek comes off like an ungrateful whiner pining for his bachelor days. What will the kids in the audience know -- or care -- about such yearnings? Its not clear why we needed this take on the lovable green coot -- especially for his swan song.

""Shrek Forever After is being billed as the last of four big-screen romps featuring the lovable slime-green ogre with the cheesy Scottish accent. And to see this final installment is to know Its time.When ""Shrek debuted in 2001 it captivated audiences with its sly sendups of conventional fairy tales. Inspired by William Steigs illustrated childrens book the spirited animated comedy delivered a Happy Meal-ready title character (voiced by Mike Myers) who rose from a swamp to win the hand of his cursed half-human soul mate Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) with help from a mouthy singing donkey (Eddie Murphy). The result was a fresh and fearlessly twisted take on ""Beauty and the Beast (Fiona converts to full-time ogre-ing when she finds her one true love) full of endearing winks and nods to a variety of storybook favorites. Above all it was funny.Then in 2004 Andrew Adamson who codirected the original led a team of writers and directors credited with giving us ""Shrek 2. Like most sequels it couldnt recapture all of the magic but it did manage to entertain with the expected barrage of pop-culture in-jokes and the introduction of Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots. In this one Shrek and Fiona were husband and wife and Shrek had to out-charm Prince Charming to keep it that way.""Shrek the Third managed little magic. Handed off to a pair of first-time directors the ridiculous 2007 sequel found Charming rallying assorted fairy tale ""losers in hopes of seizing the kingdom of Far Far Away once ruled by Fionas father. Good trumped evil again -- its not a high bar when Justin Timberlake ascends to the throne -- and as soon as proper order was restored Shrek and Fiona retreated to their beloved swamp to raise a family.Thats where ""Shrek Forever After picks up the torch.Now famous and fully domesticated Shrek seems ripe for a midlife crisis. Hes discovering that fatherhood and celebrity can be a tiresome mix The Star Tours Chariot regularly drives by his home. His toddler triplets demand full attention which leaves him no time even to wallow in the mud. And his once fearsome roar? Its become a birthday party crowd-pleaser.""Im just a jolly green joke he whines.Enter the movies designated bad guy a manic wig-wearing Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who proposes to make Shrek ""Ogre for a Day -- free to frolic and terrorize with no lasting repercussions -- in exchange for one other day from his life. What Shrek doesnt know is that his nemesis will choose to take away the day the ogre was born thereby erasing any trace of Shreks existence. When our unsuspecting hero returns home to the swamp after his day off he finds only emptiness and ominous signs. Witches on broomsticks fill the dark skies. Donkey and Shreks other pals dont recognize him. Fiona is a wanted outlaw trying to mobilize an ogre rebellion.Since all Shrek movies have a quest its no surprise that this one drags its veteran characters through a variety of adventures on their way to finding the exit clause in Rumpelstiltskins dastardly contract. Whats amazing is how flat and modestly funny those adventures are even in 3-D.Where once this DreamWorks franchise was about goosing convention it now seems all about pandering to the lowest expectations. There isnt anything in ""Shrek Forever After that rises much above formulaic family fare.""You are a cat-tastrophe Donkey remarks to a flabby Puss in Boots who has let himself go considerably since his last on-camera outing. ""And you are re-donk-ulous replies the cat.Cmon folks; this is some of the films best material""Shrek Forever After is directed by Mike Mitchell (""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo) and written by Josh Klausner (a co-writer on ""Shrek the Third) and Darren Lemke. They appear to have taken the assignment of crafting a final chapter seriously. Too seriously one might argue. Their movie brings back nearly every character in the series -- Julie Andrews as the queen John Cleese as the king Cody Cameron as Pinocchio Regis Philbin as Mabel etc. etc. -- but it is so busy reprising your favorite comic bits and references (how many times can they rip off ""The Wizard of Oz?) that it forgets to add anything of lasting value.The films special effects are just as disposable. In the post-""How to Train Your Dragon world a 3-D movie (especially one from DreamWorks the same studio that conjured ""Dragon) has to be more than smoke bombs and magic mirrors -- though these things are enough to scare squeamish little ones.Many of us will continue preferring to remember Shrek when he was just a low-tech surprisingly witty up-and-comer.

Like its watermelon-headed hero ""Shrek Forever After"" has the midlife blahs. The fourth and final chapter finds Shrek dispirited by the routine of family life with Fiona and their belching pooping triplets. He yearns for ye goode olde days when he was ferocious and feared. Viewers will feel nostalgic for the time when he was funny. This no-mojo ""Shrek"" is to its series what ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was to Indiana Jones. The original ""Shrek"" and its two sequels were wise-guy satires of fairy tales sending up the corny bits while retaining a sense of anything-can-happen amazement. Remember when Princess Fiona trilled a melody so wonderful it made her entourage of bluebirds explode? So do the screenwriters here. They dont have anything that sly and subversive to offer but they resurrect the old gag to remind us what the franchise was once upon a time. The plot for this weary outing is lifted wholesale from ""Its a Wonderful Life."" Shrek is drawn into a bad bargain by Rumplestiltskin whose specialty is magical contracts. Rumple a prancing preening pest with the personality of a snarky 12-year-old cons Shrek into signing away one little day of his life in exchange for a day of independence from mundane family responsibilities. Failing to read the fine print Shrek forfeits the day of his birth and discovers that a Shrekless world is a bleak landscape of nasty witches and persecuted ogres ruled by obnoxious King Rumple. In this parallel universe Puss in Boots is a flabby pampered housecat; Donkey gives Shrek the cold shoulder and Fiona is a fierce warrior leading an insurrection of her pickle-hued people. Josh Klausner and Darren Lemkes screenplay lurches between labored and weary as Shrek re-forges the relationships he ran from in real life. The Shrek movies were sharpest when they scoffed at the Walt Disney tradition especially the notion that physical beauty signals inner goodness. Here the series embodies the worst traits of DreamWorks animation puns pointless musical numbers mad-lib plotting and overreliance on celebrity voice casting. Vocal cameos by Larry King and Ryan Seacrest? Seriously? SHREK FOREVER AFTER  out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild action some rude humor and brief language. Computer animation has moved ahead a lot since ""Shreks"" characters were first rendered; the look of this edition is dated. The 3-D inspires a vertigo-inducing broomstick chase but constructing a clear concise action sequence is beyond the powers of director Mike Mitchell (""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo""). The film has its moments but they are a child-sized handful a cute ""Wizard of Oz"" reference and the notion that the key difference between living like a pauper or a king is the ability to draw up really confusing contracts. There is exactly one great joke here delivered by Eddie Murphys Donkey in a spat with the Gingerbread Man. The quality of laughter you will hear around that gem is a level above the tepid chuckles the rest of the movie elicits. The liveliest aspect of the film is the pesky villain Rumplestiltskin. Walt Dohrn who also oversaw much of the animation speaks in a voice that continuously slipstreams from acid sarcasm to honeyed flattery. At least he seems to be having fun. Which is more than can be said for the rest of us in the audience.

"Shrek Forever After | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shrek-forever-after ) Shrek Forever After (United States 2010) May 19 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3-D. When the first Shrek made its theatrical debut in 2001 it came accompanied by expectations normally reserved for sequels with impressive pedigrees. Unlike any previous animated endeavor it was a magically irreverent experience whose appeal crossed age and gender barriers. Unfortunately as is often the case with family-friendly blockbusters it became the flagship of a merchandising fleet. Sequels followed. Shrek 2 was enjoyable but unspectacular and Shrek 3 seemed to be going through the motions. The fourth Shrek called Shrek Forever After is being touted as ""the final chapter"" and thats unsurprising. The gooses eggs have gone from gold to silver to clad. Theres so little buzz about this movie that even those with bee-sting allergies need not be concerned. Still even though Shrek Forever After is obligatory and unnecessary its better than Shrek 3 and its likely that most who attend as a way of saying goodbye to the Jolly Green Ogre will not find themselves wishing they had sought out a more profitable way of spending 90-odd minutes. It has been said that if youre going to steal steal from the best and the filmmakers responsible for Shrek Forever After have taken this advice to heart. The core storyline has been lifted from Its a Wonderful Life albeit with the character of Clarence turned nastier than Mr. Potter. Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is provided with a chance to see life flash before his eyes as it might have been had he never been born. He gets into the situation because hes upset with the mundane day-to-day routine of being an ogre who doesnt scare anyone. For one day he wants the world to go back to a time when everything makes sense. The impish Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohn) overhears Shreks wish and offers to grant it. Shrek doesnt read the small print in the contract he signs and soon discovers that his existence is in danger. Fortune unites him with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) who is more than a little skeptical of Shreks hard-to-swallow tale. To get his old life back Shrek has to fulfill an escape clause in the contract which requires him to find his wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and share a kiss of true love with her. There are a few problems. First in this reality Fiona is a warrior queen who has long since stopped believing in things like ""true love."" Second Shrek fails to make a positive impression during their initial encounter. Finally Rumplestiltskin also knows about the escape clause and is determined not to let Shrek and Fiona lock lips. As Its a Wonderful Life knock-offs go this one isnt half-bad. Theres always a fascination with seeing a familiar world with recognizable characters tweaked in unexpected ways. Thats one reason the 2009 Star Trek worked so well. Unfortunately for those hoping the final Shrek would find its way back to the wellspring of pure entertainment that marked the original it doesnt happen. In fact the whole reason Shrek Forever After has to play the alternate reality card is because there is no place for the story to go in the ""real"" world. Shrek is comfortably married with children and hes leading a depressingly ordinary life. The animation is eye catching and rich in detail but it hasnt advanced much from what graced screens in 2001. The original Shrek was widely praised for its look and apparently the goal with the sequels was not to deviate much. Despite the passage of ten years Shrek Forever After doesnt boast a radically different style or appearance than that of Shrek Shrek 2 or Shrek 3. It is available in 3-D but this is one of the most uninspired and perfunctory applications of 3-D I can remember. Theres nothing glaringly wrong with the 3-D version. but theres nothing right with it either; the value added is minimal. The moments were few and far between when something other than the sensation of wearing uncomfortable glasses emphasized the 3-D aspect. So why pay the surcharge? Although Shrek Forever After is not as funny or as impudent is its great-grandparent some of its comedic jabs land solid blows to the funny bone. The best humor relates to Puss and Boots (Antonio Banderas) the flamboyant cat with the big sad eyes. In the alternate reality Puss has grown fat and flabby and the screenplay gets plenty of mileage from this situation. Sadly the two villains (Rumplestiltskin and his hired henchman The Pied Piper) are lacking when it comes to generating guffaws. Rumplestiltskin is a diluted Lord Farquaad. Even though this is officially the last Shrek movie theres no guarantee the character is retiring. In fact a spin-off focused on Puss in Boots is already in the work ensuring a continuation of the incredibly profitable franchise in at least some form. Is Puss a more interesting character than Shrek? At this point yes but who knows in another three years? One could successfully argue that Shrek Forever After is three Shreks too many. At least the filmmakers have allowed Shrek to depart on a strong note rather than slinking away into his swamp. There might not be much reason for excitement concerning Shrek Forever After but neither is there anything to dread. Its a perfectly acceptable family-friendly summer sequel which is likely all the filmmakers hoped for.

"Movie Review Shrek Forever After - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Antonio BanderasMovie Review Shrek Forever AfterThe script director and cast breathe refreshing new life into the saga of the lovable ogre.May 21 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In ""Shrek Forever After"" the latest edition of DreamWorks billion-dollar animated franchise we find the much-domesticated ogre in the midst of a major midlife meltdown. But hot cars and hotter babes wont soothe this savage beast a hes just looking to get his angry back. As it happens middle-aged angst suits Shrek and the movie quite well. After the blahs of 2007s ""Shrek the Third"" ""Forever After"" comes back with more heart and much of the kick-in-the-pop-culture-keister cleverness that made the greenish brute such a breath of fresh air when ""Shrek"" first blew into town nearly a decade ago. Allegedly the ""final chapter"" a though it feels about as final as a Cher farewell tour a the films usual suspects are back too with Mike Myers Cameron Diaz Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas reprising Shrek Fiona Donkey and Puss in Boots (for those of you who really have been far far away). Spicing up things in this round is Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) a deviously delicious new villain with a battalion of flying witches who considering the fierceness of their swoop and soar look as if theyve been unemployed since ""The Wizard of Oz."" To scratch that angry itch Shrek gets suckered into an ogre-for-a-day deal with Rumpel whos been pining to rule Far Far Away forever and therein lies the tension that will fuel the film. Theres fine print in the paperwork to say nothing of classic movie allusions and before you know it Shreks great escape has turned into a George Bailey reckoning and he just wants his wonderful life back. No Zuzus petals but he does turn up one of the triplets favorite squeak-toys ... The essential question becomes what would a Shrek-less Far Far Away look like? This is where being fourth in line to the crown and overly animated works to ""Forever Afters"" advantage. With the kingdom and its characters so familiar the filmmakers can have a field day dropping in sight gags around every corner of the old neighborhood which thanks to Shreks folly is now a dark world of woe and real estate decline from the crumbling Far Far Away sign to legions of jailed ogres. Bringing some much needed edge is director Mike Mitchell whose background includes storyboarding stints on a number of animated features including 2004s ""Shrek 2"" as well as directing the live action ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" but dont hold that against him. What hes managed to extract from actors and animators alike is a deeper level of emotion and one of the movies best features. Whether its the new skin each of the characters must slip into a Donkey is just a donkey Puss is pampered beyond plump and Fiona is re-imagined as a Viking-esque warrior princess seriously working the hair a or everyone trying to make sure Shrek has a proper send off it works. For all the nuance of the other central characters Mitchell lets Dohrn go a little crazy with Rumpel in a good way that keeps you wondering not if but when things are going to spin out of control. He is a modern-day villain a slick all-risk-no-reward huckster who would thrive on Wall Street a the perfect foil for the metrosexual softy Shrek has become. When Rumpel wigs out a both figuratively and literally a he nearly steals the show. Speaking of scene stealing one of the nicest surprises of ""Forever After"" is the near perfect marriage it achieves between the animation artistry which is exceptional here and the 3-D technology. Dont get me wrong the effects are snazzy enough and all sorts of things race off the screen. But they dont out-dazzle everything else which is how it should be in my book though some may wish for more wow. The story by Josh Klausner ( ""Date Night"") and Darren Lemke still exists in Hollywoods long shadow a contributing to Shreks discontent are the daily tour buses that swing by his house filled with photo-snapping fans and Rumpel craves his 15 minutes of media fame a but it is equally comfortable back in fairy-tale land. The bumps when they come tend to be battles that rage on too long or the occasional heavy hand on the allusion front a water and witches oh my a but for the most part the screenwriters never lose sight of the moral of this story Whatever else gets tossed into the mix Shrek must be the heart and soul.

The fourth movie in the series it is available in both 2-D and 3-D formats.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 21 2010Stealing a page from meta-universe science fiction - and maybe from the desperate scribes at Lost - Shrek Forever After also known as Shrek The Final Chapter (make em promise) also known as Shrek 4 finds the big green ogre venturing into an alternate reality where the scenarios played out in previous Shreks have mostly been undone.Donkey as Shreks best friend? Nope theyre strangers.Fiona as Shreks one true love and spouse? Forget it. Shes the leader of an ogre resistance movement decked out in warrior gear and built like an R. Crumb dream girl.The undoing comes courtesy of Rumpelstiltskin the mad magic barterer of storybookdom who in Shrek Forever After offers DreamWorks Animations box-office behemoth a deal In exchange for a day in which Shrek can revert to his wild and beastly ways the ogre must sign away a day from his childhood. Unbeknownst to Shrek however the one Rumpelstiltskin chooses is the day Shrek was born. Take that day away and Shrek doesnt exist. Or he exists only for the 24 hours that hes signed the contract for and then hell disappear into a black hole of nothingness.As Rumpelstiltskin who has become the tyrant king of the land observes ""Hows that for a metaphysical paradox?""And hows that for a plot device that (1) gets Shrek (the voice of Mike Myers) out of the married-with-children drudgery that has become his life (2) enables him to reaffirm his love for Fiona (Cameron Diaz) by having to woo her all over again and (3) allows the writers and director to throw The Wizard of Oz (a squadron of Margaret Hamilton-esque witches) into the mash-up of Grimm Andersen and other fairy tales that has been the Shrek series stock and trade. In addition to Puss in Boots living very large (and voiced by Antonio Banderas) this time the identifiable inhabitants of Far Far Away include the Three Little Pigs the Three Blind Mice Pinocchio and the Pied Piper.More a slick product than a piece of soulful entertainment and available for consumption in 2-D and 3-D formats Shrek Forever After has moments of visual dazzle - the aerial battle between the witches and Shrek and company inside Rumpelstiltskins grandly made-over castle is pretty spectacular - and the sour scalawag Rumpel (Walt Dohrn) preening and scheming makes for an amusingly malevolent villain. But the quick wit and multitiered pop-culture referencing that made the inaugural Shrek so much fun doesnt feel so quick or multi almost a decade down the line.Shrek Forever After is - forgive me - mediogre at best.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Share Tweet No matter how many times films and TV steal that final subplot from Its A Wonderful Life and let some hapless schmoe see what the world would have been like had he never existed it remains a resonant idea an affirmation that everyones life has meaningful impact. Or at least it does if its implemented with a little thought. Shrek Forever After the fourth in the series of CGI films about a cranky ogre voiced by Mike Myers instead settles for unlikely plot contrivances lame gags and lazy execution. Thats no huge surprise given the last two Shrek films but its still dispiriting watching a once-promising series make ever-greater commitments to apathy. Part of the problem is that ever since the first movies clever take on ""happily ever after"" writers have been exploiting the same tired loophole to make the characters unhappy again Shrek the ogre really enjoyed being a feared independent hermit and feels constrained by his new role as a good-guy husband and dad. (Which might be another resonant theme if it wasnt three movies old by now.) This time out he suffers through an excruciating montage of repetitive shrieky family life before breaking down and making an ill-fated magical bargain with Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who magically gives him a day of happy monsterdom but twists their contract to erase Shrek from history. That leaves Shrek one day to witness how his story turned out without him and to nullify the contract before the change becomes permanent. Just briefly Shrek 4 toys with a number of potentially meaningful ideas including that Shreks wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) might have been a smarter stronger person without him and that parenthood might have come at a cost for her too. But that spirit of laziness reigns so conceptual follow-up becomes secondary to watching Eddie Murphy as Donkey braying out a pop-hit medley while pretending to be a radio. The indifference might be clearest in Shreks lame never-explained failure to tell Fiona the truth and enlist her help even when she repeatedly asks whats going on. Or in the way the story plays out via poop jokes and pro forma chase scenes. Or in the gags repeated verbatim from past Shrek films. Or via the usual eye-rolling choices of pop-music cues. (Two characters meeting? Time for Lionel Richies ""Hello"") Or in the closing credits which recycle old animation of characters not even in this film. Kids movies are rarely profoundly thoughtful but theres no reason to be this insulting about it either.

In the case of the fat green alpha male in Shrek Forever After the chafe of marriage and fatherhood has led the celebrity ogre to romanticize the bad old days when he was a bachelor swamp thing who scared the populace witless. So when the devious magic-broker Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn) offers a deal that includes a day of freedom Shrek (Mike Myers) accepts. Bad move. Rumpel is the evil twin of Clarence the good angel in Its a Wonderful Life. He effectively turns Shrek into Jimmy Stewarts George Bailey horrified into action -- and repentance -- by the vision of what the kingdom of Far Far Away would have become had he never been born and Rumpel ruled the world. Theres a soft middle-aged complacency to the well-oiled mechanics of Shrek Forever After the fourth and (possibly but never say never) last episode of the now classic spoofy animated fairy tale based on William Steigs beloved 1990 childrens book. The plump green princess bride Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is back as are Shreks motormouthed buddy Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and the suave feline Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). But what was once a fresh self-referential twist on the vulturish consumption of pop culture when the first Shrek debuted in 2001 has become a lazy corporate tic. Talking over the heads of kids the enterprise counts on adult audiences to forgive the unoriginal storytelling and one more time settle for the game of spot-the-reference never mind that the references crib from the works songs catchphrases and punchlines of others for their charms. (The hip-by-proxy syndrome includes a pile-on of current pop culture darlings to voice secondary characters including Mad Mens Jon Hamm Glees Jane Lynch and Craig Robinson from The Office.) Everyone involved fulfills his or her job requirements adequately. But the magic is gone and Shrek Forever After is no longer an ogre phenomenon to reckon with. Instead its a Hot Swamp Time Machine.

Shrek Forever After Bad to fair Director Mike Mitchell. Cast Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz. Rating PG for mild action rude humor and brief language. RELATED The many faces of Mike Myers Spotlight Cameron Diaz Spotlight Eddie Murphy Spotlight Antonio Banderas Animated movies Test your knowledge of all things ogre Fairy-tale ending Is this grumpy Shreks swan song? The spark of the original film released nine years ago a gleeful skewering of Disneyfied fairy tale characters spiced with contemporary pop-culture references was so refreshing and inspired it seemed like it could go on forever. Isnt that always the way in fairy tales? Alas as with King Midas touch theres always a catch. ""Shrek the Third"" made more than 322 million. Why kill the goose that laid the golden egg? Because its time. ""Shrek Forever After"" is billed as the final installment and it should be while we still have warm feelings for Shrek and Donkey and the rest. Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is by this time a fully domesticated ogre living in the Land of Far Far Away with his wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and their triplets. He seems to lead a happy life but the grind of waking up with the kids and sliding into the routine of feeding burping and changing combined with domestic chores and the lack of a life of his own is starting to weigh on him. (Points for realism on that front.) Hey the villagers say didnt you used to be a proper ogre? Now his fearsome roar is a party trick nothing more. If only there were some way he could go back to being a mean ogre if only for a day. . . . Enter Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who weve met in a framing device. Hes a scheming little cuss happy to grant Shreks wish for reasons of his own. And remember theres always a catch. What follows is a sort of like a twisted take on ""Its a Wonderful Life"" but not really. What if the Shrek we know and love had never been born? Would the Land of Far Far Away be a different place? Well duh. While he gets his ogre groove back hes not the same old Shrek. No one knows who he is; hes just another in a line of hated feared creatures. Thus his best friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy) doesnt know him. Certainly Fiona doesnt. Instead of rotting away in the castle tower shes now a freedom fighter leading a resistance movement against . . . eh better not to say too much about how and why things have changed. Just know that they have a lot. For Shrek to make things right he must again share True Loves Kiss with her but its a tall order. Its an interesting idea the alternate universe one that requires a base knowledge of the characters. After all this time weve got that. But to remain relevant it also requires a continuing level of wit and social commentary - which is in reality what the first ""Shrek"" was engaging in beneath the clever funny jabs - and by this time thats pretty played out. Of the new characters Dohrn is good as Rumpelstiltskin (""Get me my angry wig"") but Jon Hamm Jane Lynch and Craig Robinson are largely wasted. Donkey is still funny and cute and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is now fat which is good for a couple of laughs. But weve probably got more than all the ""Shrek"" we need already. Better to let this one make its fortune as it surely will and let the franchise reside henceforth in our memories. That way everyone lives happily ever after.

His failure to realize that his is indeed a wonderful life leads him to utter a wish for just one day to cavort in his old life of swampy bachelorhood. The wish is granted by the conniving Rumpelstiltskin whose enforcement of contractual fine-print lands Shrek in a brutal parallel universe in which Rumpelstiltskin rules the kingdom of Far Far Away with an army of witches as his muscle. There Fiona (in Xena mode) leads an underground resistance movement Donkey has no memory of Shrek but still steals almost every scene hes in and an obese Puss walks away with whatever scenes Donkey doesnt. It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in and when it does it largely retreads formula ironic use of pop standards musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs risque one-liners. By the middle of the second act Forever After finally finds its groove becoming mildly amusing (the actors--Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas--are in fine form) but never rising to the inspired heights of the original. And the 3-D effects are so weak as to bring nothing to the table.

Considerably toned down are the endless pop-culture references and in-jokes to other movies. There are no Ricky Martin musical numbers this time; there is no re-creation of the bullet-time camera work from The Matrix. For this last chapter the filmmakers play things relatively straight resulting in the best Shrek movie to date (or at least the first one Ive enjoyed). Using Its a Wonderful Life as an obvious inspiration screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke pick up where Shrek the Third left off with the eponymous hero (voiced by Mike Myers) living happily ever after in the company of his wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) their three precocious children and his trusty sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Shreks life is idyllic - so blissful that hes become a tourist attraction for humans in the land of Far Far Away. Shrek starts to long for the wild days when he could still scare the townspeople with his roar and when the mischievous powermonger Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) offers him the chance to spend 24 hours as his old self he seizes on the opportunity. But theres a big string attached. Shrek Forever After was directed with an emphasis on characterizations by Mike Mitchell (Surviving Christmas Sky High) and uses 3D to subtle but enveloping effect as Shrek is stranded in an alternate universe in which he once again must win Fionas hand. He must also make allies of former friends (such as Puss in Boots voiced with the usual gusto by Antonio Banderas) who no longer recognize him. The story is constructed in a way that requires no previous knowledge of the series and the movie manages to find fresh humor and sight gags in its storybook universe from the disgusting things ogres eat to the army of witches obviously patterned after The Wizard of Ozs Margaret Hamilton. The movie is big-hearted and peppered with juicy throwaway bits I liked the way the Gingerbread Man had to turn around one of the Three Blind Mice who was cheering in the wrong direction or the line by the ogre cook (Craig Robinson) about the need for a chimichanga stand on the battlefield because everyones going to be starving after waging war. Shrek Forever After isnt essential but its breezy and likable and doesnt overstay its welcome - the first summer movie thus far to deliver on its promise to put on a good show.

Elizabeth Weitzman Monday May 17 2010 850 PM Title Shrek Forever After What does a middle-aged monster do when he loses his mojo? He returns to his roots of course. Happily its a move that revives our aging ogre and renews his flagging franchise.DreamWorks and Shrek had lost their way by 2007s ""Shrek the Third"" which was bloated with cheap gags and lazy pop-culture references. But in Mike Mitchells charming 3D entry ""Shrek Forever After"" the references are cleverly used to shape the story which borrows from classics like ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""For his fourth outing our humbled hero (voiced by Mike Myers) has turned from fearsome fiend to depressed dad.The devilish Rumpelstiltskin (Walter Dohrn) offers to send Shrek back to a more exciting past but every pact has its price. Shrek soon discovers hes drastically altered his present and may not even get a future.Because his choice has rewritten history he hasnt met Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and Rumpelstiltskin is king of Far Far Away.Wicked witches reign and ogres are hunted down as the enemy. Fiona is organizing an underground army but shes outnumbered and overwhelmed.Shrek needs to fix this mess but how? Donkey (Eddie Murphy) doesnt even know him and the spoiled Puss (Antonio Banderas) has other interests.This is - allegedly - the final chapter in the series and everyone involved appears invigorated.The 3D visuals are especially impressive offering a depth thats still too rare among animated films.The same could be said for the script which recalls - if doesnt quite match - the 2001 original in warmth and humor.Among this starry cast the standout is Dohrn a moonlighting story editor who steals every scene. His only competition is Banderas whose Puss in Boots gets his own movie next year.It may feel like the right time for Shrek to say goodbye but its always nice to know theres another fairy tale waiting to be told.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

When fantasy figures start having midlife crises and their animated franchises start having late-life crises its time to lower the wobbly green tentpole -- something few are likely to object to after ""Shrek Forever After."" The reputed swan song for the series and its first entry in 3D pic contains a respectable number of laughs but also borrows its storyline from the oft-recycled ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and if thats all its creators can do its best to put Far Far Away far far away. A strong brand means strong initial B.O. but word of mouth likely wont make for a fairy-tale ending. Burps farts and bellows have become the soundtrack to the Shrek household -- which after the swamp recovery curse removal in-law battling and nation building of the first three pics now consists of Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) three gnarly children and the ever-present Donkey (Eddie Murphy) Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) and their respective disorderly broods. As he changes endless diapers and sees his life succumb to monotonous routine Shrek (Mike Myers) begins pining for the days when he was a feared and loathsome presence in the forest around Far Far Away. Is there such a thing as male ogre menopause? Pic spends an inordinate amount of time amid the domestic chaos culminating in a scene in which Shrek smashes the cake at his kids party scares the obnoxious little troll child who looks like Newt Gingrich (one of the films sly bits) and storms off into the woods. At this point ""Shrek Forever After"" becomes both sequel and prequel It seems the evil Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn also the films head of story) who looks like a shorter Anthony Hopkins and sounds like a cross between Pee-wee Herman and John C. Reilly was cutting a deal with Fionas parents right around the time she and Shrek were falling in love and breaking her curse (the first ""Shrek""). The plan They would give Rumpelstiltskin their kingdom he would free their daughter. The deal fell through but with Shrek getting all grumpy Mr. R sees an opening Give me a day he says any day out of your life and Ill give you some peace. Shrek accepts and Rumpelstiltskin takes Shreks birthday. Suddenly this is one ogre who finds himself in a world where hes never been born. Shreks last name? Apparently its Bailey. The reason ""Its a Wonderful Life"" is a classic film is not simply because it ends in a deluge of sentimental Christmas ecstasy but because it poses a deeply troubling existential crisis with terrible cosmic possibilities -- not exactly what we want from our animated comedies. On a less weighty note the land where Shrek finds himself is a scorched forest full of flying witches all in 3D a technique helmer Mike Mitchell (a story artist for ""Shrek the Third"" whose directing credits include ""Sky High"" and ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"") uses mostly to make things scarier Heights are dizzying; horrified faces float in closeup; the occasional projectile flies at your face. To its credit though ""Shrek Forever After"" (scripted by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke) continues the series tradition of embellishing its central story with a plethora of sight gags snarky little asides rooted in fairy-tale revisionism and terrific vocal performances by Murphy and Banderas. Theyre both hilarious even in their slightly altered states in the parallel non-Shrek universe. Fiona has become the leader of the Resistance an ogre-led movement dedicated to overthrowing Rumpelstiltskin who in Shreks absence made that fateful deal with Fionas parents. Now a flame-haired Valkyrie -- an R. Crumb take on Xena the Warrior Princess -- Fiona has as much interest in Shrek as Donna Reeds spinster librarian had in George Bailey. But they fight the good fight and well you know the rest. Whether or not Shrek has outlived his usefulness as a profit center its clear that time and technology have passed him by. The original movie was released in 2001 a lifetime ago in tech years but success has meant locking the series in visually (as well as musically and comedically). Advances in animation -- notably in DreamWorks other recent toon ""How to Train Your Dragon"" -- only emphasize the dead-eyed nature of the ""Shrek"" characters and in particular the creepiness of Fionas royal parents and their off-putting faux humanity. If ""Shrek"" were to continue hed have to change and that just doesnt seem possible. Production values are tops albeit in pursuit of what seems a dated style.
