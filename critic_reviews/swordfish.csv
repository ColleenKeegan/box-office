WBs big summer release has the feel of a solid densely packed script ramped up into a ""Matrix""/""Mission Impossible"" wannabe with increasingly over-the-top results. John Travolta revives his ""Pulp Fiction"" hairdo in an attempt to recapture some of his former cool in ""Swordfish"" a half-absorbing half-ridiculous techno-thriller that often goes too far in search of audience-rousing effects. Mounted in breathlessly stylish fashion with a great-looking cast enacting a series of intriguing but deliberately ambiguous scenes Warner Bros. first big summer release has the feel of a solid densely packed script ramped up into a ""Matrix""/""Mission Impossible"" wannabe with increasingly over-the-top results. Brimming with action and intent on keeping the viewer guessing as to the true nature of its principal characters this should be a muscular if not stellar mainstream performer internationally. The interesting question domestically will be whether opening-weekend auds will be wary of a Travolta starrer after having been burned repeatedly of late; conspicuously campaigns artwork has Travolta barely recognizable in the background with Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman much more prominently featured. With director Dominic Sena laying on the edgy musicvid visual tropes and tough-guy attitudinizing rather more effectively -- and with somewhat more point -- than in last summers ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" pic is very much of a piece with producer Joel Silvers recent output Its turbo-charged with hyper-realistic attenuated slo-mo action shots; features set-pieces of negligible narrative but maximum visceral importance and boasts a well-meshed multiethnic cast along with a techno/hip-hip-conscious soundtrack. Film starts by throwing a slow curveball sure to catch everyone off stride (and one particularly ironic coming from a Hollywood studio film these days). With no ado we see Travolta sitting in a coffee shop delivering a riff on movies. ""You know what the problem with Hollywood is? It makes shit"" he says in a moment that no doubt will be much excerpted in future documentaries. He then proceeds to praise ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and Al Pacinos perf in it (a nice echo of Travoltas ""Attica Attica"" chant in ""Saturday Night Fever"") while adding that the film didnt go far enough and that its hostage-taking plot would play out entirely differently in the current instant-news era. Travoltas character Gabriel Shear soon is revealed to be the perpetrator of a bank heist himself and one much more high-concept than that dramatized in ""Dog Day."" He and his crew have wrapped 22 hostages in dynamite and ball bearings SWAT troops and TV cameras are everywhere and an amazing climactic shot of an explosion a lateral camera move with carnage seemingly floating in mid-air will leave auds gaping and anticipating a ""Matrix""-like flight from reality. Gradually the picture backs off from and eventually fails to fulfill these expectations as it moves from cyberthriller space to more conventional action territory. With the resolution of the hostage crisis left hanging yarn flips back four days to the airport apprehension and mysterious murder while under FBI interrogation of a notorious international computer hacker. At the same time Ginger (Berry) a cohort of Gabriels whose status is equally inscrutable travels to Texas to ""recruit"" Stanley Jobson (Jackman) the worlds former No. 1 hacker now an ex-con forbidden to see his daughter or so much as touch a computer. First indication of some of the ludicrousness to come is the first meeting between Stanley and swaggering Gabriel. In a private room of a bimbo-festooned nightclub that makes you think youre watching an Elie Samaha production Gabriel toys with the bewildered Stanley by having a blonde begin to service him telling a goon to hold him at gunpoint and ordering him to penetrate a difficult Dept. of Defense computer file within 60 seconds. This combination of elements is not only physically contradictory if not impossible but is crude and off-putting sensational for sensationalisms sake. Somehow Stanley passes this test making him eligible to earn 10 million by helping Gabriel in an unspecified dark task that involves cracking a government file containing billions in laundered drug money. Although suspicious of Gabriels true motives Stanley signs on mainly on the promise of being reunited with his daughter. Anti-government like all great hackers Stanley hates his FBI nemesis Roberts (Don Cheadle) for having arrested him years back and is thrown when he spots Gabriels apparent girlfriend Ginger with a wire running through her lingerie prompting a suspicious admission from her that shes really a DEA agent. Its just one of her numerous deliberate provocations. Sena and scripter Skip Woods (who wrote and directed the 1998 Tarantino clone ""Thursday"") contort themselves keeping Gabriels intentions allegiances and moral status a secret. Obsessively devoted to the cause of fighting international terrorism Gabriel has adopted a terrorists ruthless methodology in the process thinking nothing of sacrificing lives for what he deems the greater good an attitude he shares with a U.S. senator (Sam Shepard) with whom he later has a violent falling-out. Self-consciously sexed-up and hypoed by violence at regular intervals pic features a needless and silly nocturnal car chase but this is nothing compared to the grand finale. With Stanley ready to penetrate the Swordfish bank files narrative returns to the opening hostage crisis with Gabriel piling everyone into a bus. Under heavy police escort the vehicle is proceeding toward LAX and a waiting private plane when its snatched aloft by a large helicopter which then threads through the skyscrapers of downtown L.A. Its an attempt at a tour-de-force action scene thats just too preposterous to encourage the suspension of disbelief. Another instance of the films too-muchness is a father-and-endangered-daughter bond that reps one time too many that this device has been trotted out as an automatic emotional hook in an action film; its time to give it a rest. Playing an impossible-to-read man whos always on top of his game and at least one step ahead of everyone else Travolta can bring no plausibility to Gabriel so instead invests him with a large measure of brash arrogant manipulative style. Hes wonderful in the opening scene for instance dispensing movie-buff opinions and least appealing when his control-freak character lords it over everyone drink and smoke in hand. The little vertical mustache on his chin isnt terribly endearing either. But the hairs OK. As the only figure offering a vague human connection Jackman makes for a vigorous anxiety-ridden Everyman who just happens to be a computer genius. Berry is hot and mysterious while Drea de Matteo has a strong solo scene as Stanleys slatternly ex. Tech work is slicker than all get-out with Paul Camerons moody widescreen lensing and Jeff Manns diverse production design making decisive contributions. Stephen Rivkins editing turns the screws as tightly as possible bringing the picture in at 99 minutes impressive in light of the two-hour-plus running times of many recent actioners. Contrasted with the solid background score by Christopher Young electronic/hip-hop soundtrack offerings from music supervisor Paul Oakenfold grate and call undue attention to themselves.

He turned heads as the hunk in ""Swordfish"" and a whole lot more as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies. But one hit away from movie stardom Jackman has confounded expectations by taking a leading role in a Broadway musical.Whats surprising and conceivably risky about Jackmans Broadway debut in ""The Boy From Oz"" is that hes playing the undisguisedly gay disco-era darling Peter Allen the Australian singer-songwriter (""I Go to Rio"" ""Dont Cry Out Loud"") who was discovered by Judy Garland and then later wed to her daughter Liza Minnelli before dying of AIDS in 1992. Jackman slips inside the Hawaiian-shirted booty-shaking skin of his fellow Aussie with carefree flair and high-voltage charm. Jackmans a better dancer than Allen and he can belt his songs out of the park. His exuberant performance is a gallant gesture to his countryman whose outback-to-riches saga (somewhat cleaned up in the play) made him an Australian legend. Judging from the audience response to Jackman--when he takes off his shirt in Act II hes greeted with applause whistles and a lascivious purring sound rare to Broadway--an even bigger Oz legend is in the making.

Sporting a natty goatee and slicked-back hair Travolta looks every inch the criminal mastermind. Jackman is an improbably muscular computer nerd roped in reluctantly to hack for billions - and as for Berry there ought to be a law (in some cultures there surely is). You dont care about these characters but their clothes are out of sight. Especially Halles. Forget Intimacy if its porn youre after how about the scene where Travolta holds a gun to Jackmans head giving him 60 seconds to break a top secret government code while a hooker sucks him off at the same time? Cyber porn. Money porn. Gore porn. Even the films reactionary politics are obscene (not just a criminal Travolta is also a true patriot a terrorist vigilante). Slick amoral and not half as clever as it thinks it is its the perfect lads movie. I confess I enjoyed it - so shoot me.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Swordfish Splashy but Senseless By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 8 2001 John Travolta Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry star in ""Swordfish."" (Warner Bros.) Oh hi. I was just examining the macho DNA of ""Swordfish"" trying to make sense of its cellular structure you know? Lets see. Weve got An explosion that copycats the ""Matrix"" freeze-action effects. Halle Berrys naked upper torso. Hugh Jackmans naked upper torso. John Travoltas weird haircut. A bus dangling from a helicopter.What we have here is pretty much an action opera designed to elicit Beavis and Butt-head-level appreciation rather than effete applause from the critics. As in heh heh heh that was cool or Whoa how much did they pay Halle Berry to do that?Actually theres an answer to that. Berry was paid an extra 500000 for her semi-nude sunbathing scene. This movie is all about the acting. Not much more to report Im afraid. Oh sure theres a sort-of story in which Gabriel Shear (Travolta) a shady all-powerful guy who doesnt even blink when the FBI hisses at him asks Stanley Jobson (Jackman) a master hacker just out of jail to help him in a daring billion-dollar scheme.As usual in action movies the hero - thats Jobson - is forced into action because of a defenseless family member and/or the sirenlike qualities of the sexy female lead. In this case the family member is Jobsons preteen daughter Holly (Camryn Grimes) who walks around - you know - vulnerably for most of the movie; and then theres Berry who spends most of the movie dressing undressing or assuming provocative positions.Maybe they gave her an earlier cleaner draft of the script mumbling something about ""possible changes to come vis-a-vis your clothing."" Then of course they offered that second check.Theres a great deal of keyboard clattering in director Dominic (""Kalifornia"") Senas movie too as hacker Stanley attempts to bust the computer access codes of various important government agencies. And youll see all kinds of cool computer codes on the screen - cool if thats what youre into.And lots of steel surfaces. Everywhere this movie goes youre face to face with steel surfaces in nightclubs and peoples cool homes. And there are scantily clad women and steely men everywhere all of them waiting to serve all-powerful Gabe. With all the insidious global stuff hes up to you wonder why hed surround himself with this army. Payday alone would take three days out of his busy week.I cite all of these things as randomly as they appear in the movie because I can make no particular sense of the big picture - only the bits and pieces. But if youve paid to see ""Swordfish"" in the first place chances are youre not looking for ""The Sorrow and the Pity."" Just that other cool stuff.""Swordfish"" (R 99 minutes) - Contains sexual activity violence obscenity and emotional intensity.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Swordfish An Implosion of Explosions By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 8 2001 John Travolta Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry star in ""Swordfish."" (Warner Bros.) You can hear the bong-bong-bong of the big Hong Kong gong banging loudly all the way through John Travoltas ""Swordfish."" Its not a movie its a facsimile - its moves invented in that island city 20 years ago back when the only thing red about it was its bloody movies. The director John Woo was first and better but this one is louder and more outlandish.Despite the presence of a major star ""Swordfish"" is a movie whose most sterling contributions are turned in by the computer engineers the armorer the cinematography crew and the explosives rigger. The writer? If he got coffee for the guy loading the 5.56mm ammo into belts for the M-240 machine guns he earned his money.""Swordfish"" then is the almost pitch-perfect modern thriller. Thats not to say its good since ""good"" and ""bad"" as concepts have no place in the same sentence with ""Swordfish."" Nor does ""sense"" or ""restraint"" or ""humanity""; the only thing that matters is by todays pagan standards ""Does it cook?"" The answer is yes at least for a while.This movie begins with a super bang using its best trick first which may have been an artistic mistake but certainly wasnt a commercial one. We open with Travolta seemingly dressed like a 50s beatnik ready to howl the night away right down to a little jazz hipsters beardlet in the cleft of his chin that resembles a fat woolly caterpillar seeking shelter from the rain. And he is howling He is expounding with the sort of loony charming intensity that only Travolta can muster on the subject of disappointing movie endings.His choice of text is ""Dog Day Afternoon."" He is let down that the Al Pacino character didnt really have the stones to go all out as a hostage taker; how much more intense it would have been Travolta says if hed been willing to shoot hostages every 20 minutes until he got his getaway airplane.Then the camera pulls back and we realize that Travolta playing a nasty boy named Gabriel Shear is head of a robbery crew that has seized a bank; moreover he is negotiating with FBI agents and indeed he will go all the way Hes wired the hostages with remote-control bombs each and every one of them.The FBI - all except Don Cheadle who knows better - doesnt believe hell do a thing; no one is that nutso. So Shear blows up a woman.Oh the old exploding-woman gag youre thinking. No indeed. This blast is photographed in a full 180-degree arc (its done with about a thousand cameras a la ""Monday Night Football"") as it splatters outward so we can watch the spray of shredded flesh and steel-ball shrapnel the wave of concussion flipping cars shattering windows and piercing SWAT operators all the spectacle of your major urban atrocity with none of the annoying tragedy. Welcome to the 00s ladies and gentlemenAnd this is in the first two minutesUnfortunately nothing in the next 97 lives up to this extraordinarily clinical vision of the world gone berserk. Instead we flash back into a standard-issue thriller plot with all its story sloppiness moments of cheeky banter black humor (much of it involving oral sex) political conspiracy blahblah and the occasional over-the-top shootout. Of the latter category my favorite is a scene in which Travoltas hairy Shear stands up in his sports car pulls a gun out with each hand and blasts cop cars on either side of him and of course these vehicles float through the air like three-ton salmon swimming heroically upstream before coming to rest as he gets out that well-primed M-240 and hoses down the world until it seems theres not an atom left with a nucleus still in place. And of course hes laughing madly during all this fun.The plot contains a few whispers along the following lines Shear needs to hire a computer hacker played by the pleasant Aussie Hugh Jackman as a chap so reluctant (legal difficulties in the past) that only super-babelicious Ginger (Halle Berry in a role far enough beneath her to make you nauseated) can seduce him into signing up.The hacker must do something I didnt understand design a worm whatever the hell that is so he can insert it in a super-powerful government system at that bank and order the system to deposit several billion dollars in certain offshore accounts. This will enable Shear to fight terrorists. See Shear is only nominally a bank robber; really hes a right-wing nutcase CIA rogue supported by dark elements of the American political machine all of which serves to justify a sequence in which a dignified senator (Sam Shepard) is shot to death in a Western trout stream.Well why go on? Nobody really cares about the plot least of all the filmmakers second least of all you readers and in the end only the civilized if ever-smaller parts of me. The point is all this hubbub leads to the movies Big Final Action Sequence a post-robbery escape caper that involves a Skycrane helicopter a bus that flies surface-to-air missiles explosions breaking glass more bigger louder sillier. Unfortunately the last sequence not only fails to live up to the first it doesnt live up to several in the middle of the film.The director Dominic Sena guilty of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" appears to have studied his masters voice very carefully. As long as he sticks to whats been done before the movies what used to be called a wowser but now out of deference to the master of the form must be called a Woo-ser. When Sena throws in the choppers all that hot stuff cooking away ends up tepid and tasteless.""Swordfish"" (99 minutes) is rated R for sexual innuendo of a not very innuendoish variety extreme violence and intensity.

Starring John Travolta and Hugh Jackman. Directed by Dominic Sena. Produced by Joel Silver and Jonathan D. Krane. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Despite the presence of Halle Berry s bare breasts Hugh Jackmans towel John Travoltas soul patch centrifugal camerawork for the slo-mo explosions the dropping of a hostage-filled bus suspended from a helicopter men tumbling hundreds of feet down a cliff and strolling away unscratched dirty talk and an instance maybe the worlds first of gun-to-the-head sex computer hacking the mind-numbing cyberspace thriller ""Swordfish"" still leaves us asking Is that all there is? ""Swordfish"" throws so much at the audience that if anyone tries to make sense of it its likely to give their brain a hernia. All this excess leading to nothing much. With so much tossed in the air some of it cant help but stick. This lurid thriller comes to life in fits and starts and then sinks into the bog of its own cleverness once again. It begins with Travolta in his overbearing know-it-all mode making some insider Hollywood-hip talk about the Al Pacino bank-heist movie ""Dog Day Afternoon"" while cutting the end off a cigar. ""You know the problem with that movie"" he asks sucking on the cigar. ""Homophobia."" The scene expands to show incongruously hostages wrapped in explosives and taped up with ball bearings. The single best shot of the movie follows promisingly but it will take a while to realize that thats as good as it will get. The film deals with computer hacking into mysterious worlds within worlds and if that brings up distant echoes of ""The Matrix"" it is no coincidence. Both were produced by Joel Silver. This one was directed by TV commercial maker Dominic Sena (Nike and Saturn commercials and the Brad Pitt film ""Kalifornia""). Co-producer Jonathan D. Krane also did Travoltas ""Face/Off"" which may provide some more insight -- and its needed -- about whats going on in ""Swordfish."" For another hint Travolta talks about Houdini as a great artist of misdirection. Travolta considerably better groomed than he was in ""Battlefield Earth"" plays a powerful mysterious figure described as ""living in a world beyond our world."" For reasons that may or may not have something to do with superpatriotism he needs to crack the worlds banking system. Jackman (""X-Men"") used to be the worlds ""most dangerous hacker"" until he was sent to prison for two years -- everybody is ""the worlds best"" something or other in this jumpy hyperbolic film. He also is the worlds greatest encryption expert. To prove it he orders triple espressos. Travolta wants him to worm his way into the worlds banking system computers. As glassy-eyed moviegoers have come to notice it is very hard to make someone clicking away at a computer keyboard interesting although God knows many have tried. To its dubious credit ""Swordfish"" has come up with something the ""deep throat"" solution. On another occasion Jackman will sit at the keyboard in front of eight screens and do a little celebratory jig. Why were not sure. He has yet to come up with a role to match his Wolverine ""X-Men"" success. Berry is an agent for Travolta who gets entangled with Jackman. She has a cool way of talking. To the scruffy Jackman she says ""I suggest you re- evaluate the way you look."" In the finale set in Los Angeles a bus filled with hostages who have explosives strapped to them is lifted by a helicopter (dont ask) until cables at one end break and it smashes into high-rise offices and still ""Swordfish"" elicits little awe. Amazing. Advisory Contains nudity violence and explicit sex.

John Travolta is not wearing dreadlocks or platform boots. Yes Halle Berry goes topless -- and so does Hugh Jackman. Theres a nice twist at the end of the film. And here are some things that you probably should know ""Swordfish"" is idiotic. Travolta is sporting the same haircut he wore in ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Hes also playing the same standard-issue bad guy he played in two films directed by John Woo ""Face/Off"" (1997) and ""Broken Arrow"" (1996). And by the time this train wreck of a film is over you dont care about the twist at the end. Of course you probably knew all that too. ""Swordfish"" was directed by Dominic Sena who began his career directing MTV music videos and flashy commercials for products such as Nike. This ""slash and burn"" background showed in his last film ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" (2000) a equally bombastic action flick that starred Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.

"USATODAY.com - Swordfish is blunted by absurdity Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/07/2001 - Updated 0244 PM ET Swordfish is blunted by absurdity By Mike Clark USA TODAY Swordfish (out of four) Stars John Travolta Hugh Jackman Halle Berry Don Cheadle Vinnie Jones Sam Shepard Director Dominic Sena Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for violence language and sexuality/nudity In a recent jammed big-theater screening of Swordfish only two people applauded at the end of the movie. And only for a second. An earlier Halle Berry topless scene induced a heartier clap from a patron so its possible that the producers Joel Silver and Jonathan D. Krane spent more than they had to on explosions and other forms of mass destruction. Still the movie has constant mayhem and a speedy pace -- unless of course you have a yen for more (or less) of Berry or the sight of John Travolta in another of his silly haircuts. The rest is beyond belief something about a cash cow of a covert government operation that long ago took on a life of its own. Read more Video Swordfish trailer Self-appointed counterterrorist Travolta in cahoots with -- now heres a surprise -- a U.S. senator (Sam Shepard) wants this secret money for his own quasi-patriotic means. To this end he has comely employee Berry recruit the worlds top computer hacker (Hugh Jackman) who is now penniless. And Jackman needs money for lawyers fees to fight his vodka-swilling ex-wife in court who has taken their little girl to live with a porn king. The feds have forbidden Jackman to go near computers but Travolta offers him 10 million to crack the governments system. The testing of Jackmans keyboard prowess is one of the years stupidest scenes and you keep wondering why loaded Travolta even needs the governments money. If the XFL had had all the start-up cash Travolta has it could have survived its TV ratings for a century. Swordfish may run just 99 minutes but thats enough time to keep mulling how silly it is. Leaving monster tracks Travolta and Co. bump off a suspect in an FBI office assassinate a national figure kill eight people in a city shootout before blowing up a block of Los Angeles. You never sense that this four-day carnage is having any effect on the national psyche but it probably had an effect on Traffics Don Cheadle again playing a fed. You can almost hear him telling director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds) ""Steven Soderbergh sure didnt do it this way."" So much luck is pressed with an absurdly overblown finale that 60 seconds will likely be Swordfishs shelf life after a couple of noisy opening weekends. And even if Travolta has fun spewing attitude with his role its no fun thinking about his recent movies (Lucky Numbers Battlefield Earth). In terms of being taken seriously hes not far from being where he was just before Pulp Fiction when his career had lost its juice.

Posted June 8 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT The enjoyably corrupt and thrill drunk Swordfish opens with the disarming image of John Travolta staring into the camera as he lights up a cigar and invites us to prepare ourselves for yet another piece of Hollywood ""shit."" Movies he says with their vulgar sensation and happy endings no longer possess ""realism."" He goes on to talk about ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and how it might be made today - with a ""blow you away"" ending in which the robbers get away scot free. We then proceed to watch that very situation complete with a spectacularly detonating human hostage bomb; it turns out to be the scene that Travoltas stylish sociopath is right in the middle of resolving. The irony of this speech which sounds as if it could be an excerpt from a Jerry Bruckheimer version of ""Reservoir Dogs 2"" is all too obvious in its smirky hypocrisy Clearly the reason that a lot of people will want to see ""Swordfish"" is because they like ""shit"" action thrillers with happy endings and zero realism. Yet its hard not to get seduced by the way that Travolta sporting a freaky vertical soul patch and stringy hair that makes him look like an older sleazier Vincent Vega in ""Pulp Fiction"" electrifies the space around him with his mellifluous and cocky authority. Give this actor a good speech (and this one is just intricate enough to make you wish that Quentin Tarantino would get off his duff and make ""Reservoir Dogs 2"") and he can be as magnetic as ever. It will come as no surprise that were hearing the first and last bit of literate dialogue in ""Swordfish."" The movie is crap all right but its canny and atmospheric and highly burnished crap. Travoltas shadowy sports car driving Gabriel presides over a glibly crooked ""Mission Implausible."" The films hero Stanley (Hugh Jackman) is a legendary subterranean hacker who is hired by Gabriel to break into a computerized bank file that contains the DEAs 9.5 billion stash of undercover drug money. Jackman with his ""so whos buying the next round?"" terseness is like a less charming Mel Gibson who makes you realize that Gibson by now has too much charm. Jackman does screw you nonchalance with expert efficiency but hes at his best in the hacker scenes where Stanleys gift becomes a nearly athletic extension of his brainpower. Director Dominic Sena who made ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" with its rusty chassis of a plot and its full sizzle labyrinthine car chase is one of the new trash kings who specialize in staging kicks that are so glossy and picturesque theyre nearly abstract. In ""Swordfish"" Sena teases us with fake human elements like the daughter that saintly ex con Stanley is trying to win in a custody battle or his flirtation with Gabriels glorified girl Friday (Halle Berry acting blankly in a preposterous role). Mostly though Sena wires the movie for tension. Gabriels audition of Stanley might be an entire debased action picture crammed into three minutes and the films socko climax with a bus swinging through skyscrapers as it dangles from an industrial helicopter overtops over the top. A good movie? Hardly. But more than enough to pass a dog day afternoon.

"Swordfish | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; swordfish ) Swordfish (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""You know what the problem with Hollywood is - they make shit."" It is with that statement - not profound but undeniably true - that Swordfish opens. And while this movie isnt going to convince anyone that the major studios have suddenly turned over a new leaf and are producing better fare its certainly a lot more entertaining that most of the painfully long and joyless cinematic ""events"" that have thus far marked the dismal Summer of 2001. In its zeal to cram every potential blockbuster with as many special effects as possible Hollywood has forgotten that summer movies should be made for the appreciation of the consumer not to give filmmakers an arena in which to show off. Swordfish at least remembers that this sort of film is supposed to be fun. Like Die Hard and Speed before it Swordfish is escapist entertainment that requires a significant level of suspended disbelief. While this motion picture lacks the strong scripts and easy-to-identify-with central characters of its antecedents (the aforementioned summer action flicks) its deficiencies in those areas dont detract significantly from its watchability. The screenplay credited to Skip Woods is silly and often preposterous but its not dumb. It pokes fun at itself on a fairly constant basis although never straying so far over the line that it morphs into self-parody. Director Dominic Sena (Gone In 60 Seconds) puts things into testosterone-and-adrenaline overdrive delivering a healthy portion of chases leavened with high-tech gadgetry and a helping of raunchy under-the-table sex and high-profile nudity. The story is presented in a convoluted manner starting in the middle flashing back for about an hour then returning to the present. Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) is the films charismatic villain a man so wealthy and powerful that ""he lives a life where nothing is beyond him."" In this case hes planning a 9.5 billion electronic bank robbery the proceeds of which he can use to finance anti-terrorist terrorist activities. His surprisingly small crew includes the sexy Ginger (Halle Berry) who harbors a secret and the stoic Marco (Vinnie Jones). Now he wants to add ex-super hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) to his payroll. At first Stanley isnt interested - he just got out of prison and doesnt want to go back. Then Gabriel dangles an irresistible lure in front of him - the chance of regaining custody of his beloved daughter Holly (Camryn Grimes) who is currently living with her porn-star mother. So Stanley agrees and this places him once again into conflict with FBI agent Roberts (Don Cheadle) the man who previously busted him. Now with his team assembled Gabriel embarks upon the heist using violent amoral pyrotechnic techniques and fooling his pursuers by pulling Houdini-like deceptions out of his bag of tricks. In Speed a bus took flight for a moment. In Swordfish its airborne for a lot longer. Thats one of many interesting action sequences contained in this surprisingly spare movie (its only a little over 90 minutes long). Theres also a long tumbling foot race down an almost-vertical cliff-side and a car chase that manages not to be boring. In between Sena keeps things moving with snappy dialogue and sexy women. (Obviously a guy flick.) Theres also plenty of mayhem (including one digitally-rendered explosion that is shown in slow-motion as the camera pans through 360 degrees around it) and a high body count. The movie contains a few surprises although if you pay careful attention to Travoltas opening monologue about Dog Day Afternoon youll get a hint about where everything is going. As the bad guy Travolta is fine although he lacks the panache brought to a similar role by Alan Rickman in Die Hard. In fact Travolta was more menacing in both Broken Arrow and Face/Off. And with age hes starting to get a little pudgy around the middle and fat in the face. Hugh Jackman who is becoming increasingly high-profile after starring as Wolverine in X-Men makes an adequate protagonist although his Stanley Jobson is no John McClane (his motives - a ""regular"" guy saving his family - are the same). Vinnie Jones the Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels soccer player-turned-actor says very little (as usual) letting his demeanor do all the talking. Don Cheadle plays the sympathetic cop. Then theres Halle Berry who isnt required to do much more than to assume a number of sexy poses and appear briefly topless. The latter act has earned her and the film a certain element of notoriety. To entice her to bare her breasts the filmmakers offered an obscene amount of money (sources differ on the exact amount but it was somewhere between 500000 to 1000000 as an add-on to her base salary for the nudity) which she accepted. And while she admittedly has very nice breasts that seems like an awful lot of money to pay her to expose them. By using computer hacking as a plot element Swordfish attempts to be high-tech. There are some neat computer graphics and the dialogue occasionally sounds convincing (although those in the know will catch some laughable errors) but thats all window dressing for the caper action. The movie is loud flashy and violent and certain viewers will probably offended by the casual manner in which some of the deaths occur. But for those on the lookout for this sort of motion picture thats irrelevant. Swordfish isnt art but its not shit either.
