But the players are all played by people of interest. If Woody Harrelson Cheryl Hines Dennis Farina Richard Kind David Cross and Chris Parnell were having a cafeteria lunch together youd want a seat at that table. When theyre sitting around the tables in this movie its a different story. They have nothing entertaining to do even if they seem self-amused at this movies conceit a mockumentary about big-stakes poker.As comedy its flat. As documentary its unfocused. As mockumentary its passe. The mania for poker has come and ebbed. So the filmmakers (the Hollywood screenwriter Zak Penn directed and co-wrote with Matt Bierman) take a different angle by trying to build a carnival out of all the personalities on display. The film is littered with television actors whove made you laugh before - a very tan Ray Romano an even tanner Jason Alexander (regrettably playing Middle Eastern) and Estelle Harris who played Alexanders mother on ""Seinfeld"" - and their determination to make you giggle can be as tedious as the movie. Its nice to see Judy Greer who really could upset Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow in a Teri Garr contest. Even so its aggravating watching her put together a sweet complicated character amid so much flotsam and filler. Judy pace yourselfI guessed Hank Azaria would pop up and there he was. Michael McKean too although it must have been hard going from the penthouse of those fake Christopher Guest documentaries to the basement of ""The Grand."" The movie never hits on a fresh idea. Too many scenes appear to be waiting for comedy to spring from improvisation like every interaction between games. Hines Kind and Parnell are fun to watch especially the underrated Parnell who really appears to be going for something clever as an ingenious sociologically insensitive man-child. Hes not always funny but hes always interesting. Even better hes playing a guy named Harold Melvin whos nothing like the Harold Melvin of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.A satire of the poker world is ultimately redundant. Whenever I catch a game on ESPN2 the ridiculous seriousness seems to mock itself. The movies one true surprise is the appearance of the filmmaker Werner Herzog who already mocked himself with a cherry on top in Penns previous film the far more inspired ""Incident at Loch Ness"" (2004). Predictably enough in ""The Grand"" Herzog plays a sadist card shark called The German. Less predictably hes very sexy. And hes having enough fun with his punisher shtick to make you sad when he exits. You want to see the shark feed - even on all this movies empty calories.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

The one with the neatly lined sidewalk wide front porches and manicured lawns which has since crumbled into the scarred gang-ridden part of town you avoid? Ever been in awe of your father or your grandfathers virtuosic vocabulary of racial slurs that dates back seven decades? Or his rants on how everythings gone to sht since the [insert ethnicity] got off the boat? Well if youve somehow forgotten Gran Torino will remind you. The 1972 Ford Gran Torino muscle car that glistens in Walt Kowalskis (Clint Eastwood) Detroit driveway attests to better days. When American automakers thrived decency dictated behavior and hard work equaled the good life. Then Ford fell and Hmong immigrants moved in next door. Now that his wifes passed on the former Ford employee and Korean War vet is a lone dinosaur in the graveyard of a soon-to-be-extinct species. But though the film feels like a requiem Kowalskis heart is still defiantly beating. With a personality as prickly as his looks -- flint-eyed squint sour puss scruffy hair -- hes a bad-ass old coot. With a stinging wit and a tongue that comes out swinging. ""Grrr"" he growls and spits his disapproval at the world. Its an idiosyncratic performance that might easily have descended into comedic caricature. But Clint somehow pulls it off with profound pathos and bravado. When Thao the son of the fatherless Hmong family next door is harassed by a cousin and his crew of gang bangers Walt does a Dirty Harry and steps in to save him. Grateful relatives shower him with gifts while Thaos sister Sue (Ahney Her) -- with a firecracker wit to match Kowalskis politically incorrect sense of humor -- coaxes him out of his bitter isolation into her home and the Hmong community. (With beer and home cookin.) After Thao attempts to steal Walts Gran Torino as a part of a gang initiation his mother commands him to work off his debt doing whatever Walt tells him to. Having been a hard-to-please Dad for his own sons Walt takes Thao under his wing. This means embroiling himself in the troubled youths struggle to stay out of his cousins gang which inevitably leads to violence. At times a Wild West throw-down at other moments terrifyingly honest and ugly. Think Dirty Harry Redemption. Ahney charms but the rest of the casts acting is muted and unmemorable. In the end minus Ahney Clint carries the film -- both as star and director -- on his formidable shoulders. Spectacularly. Yet in some situations the success of a lone gnarly geriatric vigilante prevailing over a multitude of well-armed morally free-wheeling criminals seems unrealistic as do his risky choices (risking more than his life) and the outcome of his final actions at the films climax. The dialogue however is sly captivating and hilarious. Gran Torino holds a mirror to the face of an American dream in decline. The gritty warts-and-all detail understated truth and heartbreaking familiarity we see compose a reflection of ourselves that arguably no filmmaker or actor has revealed to audiences so accurately -- a face thats hard to forget while it still haunts us.

If its trailer promises a vigilante movie the comedy-drama on release is actually a rather wise insightful exploration of family and friendship violence and vengeance.Admittedly retired Detroit autoworker and Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski (Eastwood in what sadly may be his last lead turn) initially comes across like a curmudgeonly elderly relative of Harry Callahan unable to conceal his disdain for his folks his late wifes priest and those now inhabiting his slightly run-down suburb many of whom are Hmongs who left south-east Asia for the US due to the Vietnam War. One such is shy teen Thao (Bee Yang) whose reluctant initiation into a local gang involves stealing Walts beloved 1972 Gran Torino...Cue much conflict Nick Schenks screenplay centres on the encounter between Walt - a politically incorrect old bigot scarred by war - and todays multicultural society. But as the film proceeds with Thaos sassy sister Sue (Abney Her) arousing both Walts protective instincts and his hitherto neglected capacity for self-analysis it becomes more complex and engaging and its often very funny (as in a barber-shop scene where traditional American masculinityis hilariously exposed as an absurd construct). Finally theres a very moving development that takes Walt way beyond Callahans ethos. Eastwoods subtle performance is as charismatic and effective as ever while the movie covers his abiding preoccupations - race age individualism in a conformist world - with wit and intelligence. And in insisting that friendships more important than blood ties (or religious faith) Clint quietly goes against the grain. Predictably superior fare.

"Gran Torino | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Gran Torino Print Page Email Page Search Gran Torino (2008; Rated ) A- "" Clints last screen appearance?"" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Gran Torino(2008; R)In theaters Friday 12 December 2008 Summary Disgruntled Korean War vet Walt Kowalski sets out to reform his neighbor a young Hmong teenager who tried to steal Kowalskis prized possession his 1972 Gran Torino. Genre Crime DramaDirector Clint EastwoodCast Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwood directs and makes what might be his last onscreen appearance in ""Gran Torino."" And this is a perfect career-crowning performance for the macho icon. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski a very old-school Korean war veteran who has nothing but contempt for the Asian family next door. But he bonds with them over a gang war and I dont want to give away any more than that. Lets just say this is a brilliant and challenging commentary on a lot of earlier Clint Eastwood roles. For the first half of the film we get a series of chuckle-inducing crowd-pleasing ""Dirty Harry"" moments. Kowalski whose language often makes him sound like Archie Bunkers favorite cousin gets the better of the young punks in the neighborhood including two separate gangs. But Eastwood is much too savvy and has been through far too much to be interested in serving up a simple dish of revenge fantasies for the junior Kowalskis in the audience. As Walt takes a fatherly interest in the teenagers next door as the tension with the dominant gang in the neighborhood escalates it seems as if were heading for an Old West style confrontation. And then... Eastwood is at his growling best and the cast of mostly unknown supporting actors is uniformly excellent. This is one of the best movies of the year. Itll surprise you and move you.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 10 2009 Save for later Saved Clint Eastwood stars in Gran Torino Courtesy Of Warner Bros.          View Caption About video ads View Caption of As Korean war vet Walt Kowalski in ""Gran Torino"" Clint Eastwood seems to be playing a crotchety Dirty Harry.I never took Harry Callahan seriously although in a guilty-pleasure kind of way I greatly enjoyed his manginess. Harry was Eastwoods avatar of a righteous lawman swamped by societys scum (i.e. hippies lefties feminists and any wacko combo therein). He existed in a perpetual state of slow burn punctuated by gunplay and kabooms.In ""Gran Torino"" which Eastwood also directed Walt is a recently widowed Detroit auto worker whose fuse is as short as Harrys. He cant stand his bickering children and spoiled grandchildren. Well stocked with beer but still in fighting trim he spends quality time on his porch bemoaning the influx of Asian immigrants into his blue-collar neighborhood particularly the Hmong family next door. Spewing racial epithets under his breath often over his breath too Walt is a snarly Scrooge which should be a tip-off that redemption is on the way. (Walts intermittent bouts of coughing up blood are a blatant tip-off that mortality is also en route.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Get off my lawn"" is Walts battle cry which may explain why his lawn is as immaculate as his mouth is foul. Chief target of his wrath are the local Hmong gangbangers who are trying to recruit teenage Thao (Bee Vang) who lives next door with his old-school mother grandmother and plucky sister Sue (Ahney Her). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Gran Torino One of the nicer things Walt calls Thao is ""Toad."" When the boy too meek to be gang material flubs a gang initiation by attempting to steal Walts mint-condition 72 Gran Torino Thaos family makes amends by requiring him to do Walts chores. Soon enough Walt feels closer to this kid than to his own brood and Sue who has Walts number wears down his gruffness. Can the Ghost of Christmas Past be far behind?This is Eastwoods first acting job since ""Million Dollar Baby"" and his range like his raspiness is fairly one-note. As an actor he draws on the ample affection he has built up with audiences of all stripes over the years. He has never won an Oscar for his emoting but notwithstanding the awards hype his performance here is closer to iconography than to acting. This has always been true of Eastwood just as it was with John Wayne (who nevertheless won the Best Actor Oscar for ""True Grit"").Because the movie takes a not uncharacteristically Eastwoodian swerve into seriousness near the end ""Gran Torino"" could almost be taken as his swan song except that at 78 Eastwood shows no signs of letting up. (Its his sixth film as a director in five years and coming after the disappointing ""Changeling"" his second in 2008.)This is among his lesser recent movies which doesnt diminish its likability. In fact its pleasing to see Eastwood working the middle of the emotional register for a change. Undoubtedly ""Gran Torino"" was conceived by screenwriter Nick Schenk with Eastwood in mind. It asks us to see Walt as both himself and as a compendium of Eastwoods greatest hits - not only Dirty Harry but the boxing coach in ""Million Dollar Baby"" the convict in ""Escape From Alcatraz"" the secret service agent in ""In the Line of Fire"" (these last two are his best career acting jobs) - and just about everybody else hes ever portrayed.This deification would be obnoxious but for the fact that Eastwood seems to carry his legend rather lightly. Perhaps he recognizes that especially in America especially in Hollywood if you stay in the saddle long enough you become an icon whether you want to be one or not. As an actor and so far as one can tell as himself Eastwood seems bemused by his megastature. Maybe his snarls were always harmless but they certainly are now. Hes mellowed. He doesnt want us to stay off his lawn. Grade B (Rated R for language throughout and some violence.)

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Harry Callahan would respect Walt Kowalski. Both men look at life through eyes narrowed in suspicion both know their way around firearms and both take no lip from punks. In fact if Dirty Harry were an auto worker in Detroit rather than a cop in San Francisco he might have wound up just like Walt living out his widowed retirement years in a meticulously maintained home watching the neighborhood decay around him and snarling at the local Asian street gangs ""get off of my lawn."" Walt is the latest character in Clint Eastwoods portrait gallery a flinty unapologetically racist Korean War vet who is not afraid to brandish his Army-issue M-1 Garand rifle or Colt .45 when the situation requires it. He enters ""Gran Torino"" as an antihero rasping profanities at his thoughtless adult children his parish priest his Hmong neighbors and the modern world in general. Hes defined by the 72 Ford coupe he helped build and keeps in immaculate repair in his garage. The Gran Torino is no classic but its a sweet metaphor representing a time when America was on top. The Big Three looked at competitors from Japan with disdain for their fussy quality control and wimpy efficiency. We built things for ourselves even if they were engineered for obsolescence. As Archie and Edith Bunker used to sing ""those were the days."" In ""Gran Torino"" Walt sits on his porch with his dog and a cooler of beer glaring at a changed world. He doesnt like the Hmong immigrants who have moved in. Perhaps they remind him of his wartime experiences where he won a Silver Star for battlefield actions that still haunt him half a century after the fact. Like many late-period Eastwood characters Walt is a critique of the violent roles Eastwood played in the 1960s -- the Man With No Name with second thoughts. He has traded blood for blood in the past although he has misgivings about what he has done. Slowly unwillingly Walt is drawn into the life of the family next door when teenage Thao (Bee Vang) and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her) run afoul of local hoodlums. Walt stands up for Sue in a sidewalk confrontation facing off against a gang of young thugs and staring them down with sheer ice-cold bravado. He straightens out Thao when the kid is pressured by gangbangers to steal Walts car. Walt begins spending time with his new neighbors warming to them. He takes timid Thao under his wing and enjoys bantering with Sue who bats away Walts racist epithets with spunk and sass. Then they are forced into a confrontation that puts to the test Walts history of violence his newfound sense of loyalty to his neighbors and his sense of moral responsibility. GRAN TORINO  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language throughout and some violence. Eastwood directs the film with his usual solid no-fuss craftsmanship sketching the characters economically cranking up the dramatic urgency and also tossing off good laughs. The script by Twin Citian Nick Schenk appears to be moving down the formula assembly line to a predictable conclusion but there are twists in store. Eastwood has no patience for easy conventions. The stunning payoff is one of those inspirations that feels inevitable in retrospect but completely fresh and unexpected in the moment. If you see it coming your vision is better than mine. Eastwoods second film this year is a compelling study of anger and violence and the guilt and shame that shadow them. He has sat high in the saddle for decades but rarely has he ridden so tall as in the drivers seat of ""Gran Torino.""

Clint Eastwood plays a grizzled Korean War veteran who mentors a young Hmong teenager who tries to steal his prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino. Photo Anthony Michael Rivetti WARNER BROS. PICTURES Gran Torino 1 / 1 Back to Gallery We all need Dirty Harry. Even Clint Eastwood needs him -- with his you-feel-lucky-punks and that all-perceiving squint of moral discernment. Clint-as-Harry isnt a mans man; hes a mans mans man a paragon of taciturn machismo that other paragons look to in times of crisis. When you need some dude to come along and wreak justice upon the scum of the Earth hes pretty much your guy. So I understand really I do why Eastwood the director dusted off Dirty Harry and hired Eastwood the actor to play him in Gran Torino. He isnt called Dirty Harry in the movie -- hes an old fart named Walt -- but theres no mistaking the rasp in his voice or the uncompromising crankiness of his Weltanschauung. If you wondered whatever became of Inspector Callahan after The Dead Pool well look at him now a widowed Polish-American Korean War vet stubbornly hanging onto his house his ethnic hatreds and his 1972 Ford Gran Torino in a tough part of Detroit. Walt needs redemption. Thats obvious enough even without the puppy-faced cleric (Christopher Carley) who keeps showing up outside his door pressing him for his confession. Father Janovich is a stock character cut from some truly flimsy cardboard -- he can barely hold it together in two dimensions -- but hes a fair indicator of the movies best inclinations and worst flaws. It wears its morals on its sleeve right next to its cliche heroics and transparently manipulative plot. This marks Eastwoods first appearance as an actor since 2004s Million Dollar Baby and hes already earned accolades for his work behind and before the camera. But I belong to a different school of thought. In my school dubbed the What Am I Not Getting? Academy Gran Torino is the most obvious and least interesting of the four movies hes directed in the last two years. Written by first-timers Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk it opens at the funeral for Walts late wife. There we find his spoiled granddaughter and two boob sons who seize the occasion to whine about his shortcomings (great timing fellas) ""Dad still lives in the 50s"" and ""Theres nothing anyone can do that wont disappoint the old man."" In the eulogy the priest lobs the usual rhetorical questions. ""What is death? Is it the end or is it the beginning?"" And while hes on the subject ""What is life?"" Walts response to this and other stabs at philosophizing is to look annoyed and mutter a flood of pejoratives including several outmoded racist terms from the drive-in era. He calls the Hmong in his neighborhood ""slopes"" and ""gooks"" and ""swamp rats"" which would under normal circumstances reveal him as the worst sort of jackass but these are hardly normal circumstances. This is Eastwood people. Before long the angry white codger will come to their rescue. The key to everything is that beaut in the garage a shiny 72 Torino. Bookish teen Thao (Bee Vang) forced by a shady cousin and his gang makes a weak attempt at stealing it. Walt busts him holds him at gunpoint and scares off the gangsters. In the days that follow Thaos grateful family crowd his porch with riots of flowers and tray after tray of food. They persuade him to let Thao work as recompense. And sure enough Walt bends his stiffly bigoted posture for the lovely Hmong clan next door. These scenes driven by abrasive humor and gently simmering warmth are the beating heart of Gran Torino. When Walt mentors Thao spars with his feisty sister (Ahney Her) or avoids his truculent grandmother (Chee Thao) the film has an easy unforced vibe. Eastwood does a better job directing the largely non-professional Hmong cast than he does directing himself. He just keeps doing his Dirty Harry glare whipping out guns real and imaginary. But its hard not to see him as Mr. Wilson -- Dennis the Menaces crotchety neighbor. Skinnier hairier no mustache. All the same a startling resemblance. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Refurb Samsung 55"" 4K LED LCD UHD Smart TV for 550 + free... Dell Celeron Dual 12"" Touch 2-in-1 Laptop for 195 + free...

Comments (1) click to enlarge Gran Torino Rated R  2008 Like Woody Allen Clint Eastwood has reached the point where his movies are better when hes not in them. Changeling his grim but fascinating period drama based on a series of child murders in the 20s projected onto a traumatized mother the conservative anger at the justice system that runs all through his career. Coming down the pike two months later Gran Torino offers little beyond a plausible scenario for the 78-year-old star to revive and mull over his classic hardass persona. He plays a bigoted old coot in a decaying Detroit neighborhood; bereaved by his wifes death and haunted by his brutality in the Korean war he unexpectedly finds common cause with a pair of Hmong teenagers living next door. Eastwood is still a primal force on-screen but his unusual practice of shooting scripts as written which served him well on Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby here leaves him exposed to Nick Schenks familiar situations and awkward dialogue.

"Movie review Gran Torino -- 3 of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Gran Torino -- 3 of 5 stars Clint Eastwood stars as an iron-willed and inflexible Korean War veteran living in a changing world who is forced by his immigrant neighbors to confront his own long-held prejudices when someone tries to steal his Gran Torino. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The racist homophobic Dirty Harry Callahan has retired in Detroit. Sgt. Highway of Heartbreak Ridge may not wear his stripes but he still keeps his rifle loaded. And William Munny the haunted aged gunfighter of Unforgiven has one last shot at redemption.It took Clint Eastwoods entire career to build Walt Kowalski the tough and bitter old bigot the actor plays in Gran Torino. Its a film about race and tolerance and a culture clash that if Walt is lucky will end in a draw. Thats the best the embattled old white retired auto worker can hope for in an America thats a lot more multi-cultural than it used to be.Walt is a modern day Archie Bunker. He has just buried his wife. Hes not on good terms with his sons. But hes not leaving his corner of Greater Detroit just because Latinos blacks and now Asians have moved in and brought teen gang problems with them. Walt has a defiant chip on his shoulder and a vast catalog of racial slurs at his disposal many of them acquired during his Korean War service. Hes too happy to trot them out when a Hmong family moves in next door. ""What are you fish-heads lookin at?""But Walt isnt blind. The gang wars mean that Hmong ""cousins"" want the boy next door as a recruit. The kids initiation? Steal the old white mans prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino a car Walt built on the line back when ""muscle car"" and ""Detroit"" werent anachronisms.But Walt foils this plan and the boys sister (Ahney Her fresh and funny) shows up to insist that the boy has shamed the family. He owes Walt atonement so she talks the old bigot and the Hmong punk whom he calls ""Toad"" (Bee Vang) into a reluctant partnership.Eastwood filmed this in a straightforward old-school style which suits the corny and too-predictable story. Walt warms to Toad (Thao is his real name) too easily. But he teaches him how to be a man in America -- how to use tools fix stuff get a job and blend in with the politically incorrect. The director makes amusing points about how thin-skinned the culture can be about race when in the right hands ""hate speech"" is just a way of appreciating our differences something a grown man can do without giving or taking offense. Walts a ""polack."" His barbers a ""dago."" Whats the big frigging deal? Gran Torino grinds through its gears in an efficient if generally graceless manner with occasional blasts of violence interrupting a film that is content to be the cutest movie Clints done since his days of co-starring with an orangutan. But its an amiable and amusing sociology lesson both for the people who cant get over the fact that a black man is now their president as well as the more P.C. folks who elected him.

In ""Gran Torino"" the guy with the clutched heart is bigot Walt Kowalski played with flinty reserve by Clint Eastwood in his first role since the 2004 Academy Award-winning ""Million Dollar Baby."" Walts ""bahs"" and ""humbugs"" are delivered as racial epithets directed most often at his Asian neighbors. But his snarl has many targets. When we first meet him Walt is standing ramrod straight at his wifes funeral service. He growls while looking at his sons their families his teen granddaughter arriving late. He makes the same rumbling sound listening to carrot-topped fresh-faced Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) launch into a by-the-numbers eulogy. The retired Ford assembly-line worker lives in a Michigan neighborhood that has long ago become home to working-class immigrants like his next-door neighbors. The title refers to Walts prize possession a forest green 1972 Ford muscle car that sits in a garage under a tarp. Newcomers Ahney Her and Bee Vang play Sue and Thao Lor the teenagers next door. The Lors and other Hmong families came to the U.S. after the Vietnam war. When bookish Thao is conscripted by a cousin and other Hmong gang members to steal the Torino he fails. He winds up making amends to a reluctant Walt who becomes a neighborhood hero when he delivers a little rough justice to the gang. If it sounds sentimental it is if muscularly so. ""Gran Torino"" invites a love-it-or- loathe-it reaction. There are moments when Walt isnt the only throwback were not sure we like. No character escapes the films heavy crayon rendering. Yet because of Eastwoods assured gravity and the sweeter work of Her and Vang the movie moves. Sue is the true catalyst for our fondness and forgiveness for Walt. Actress Her plays the young woman with a kind of self-assured bravado. She has a sociologists grasp of inter-ethnic and gender conflict. ""Hmong girls go to college. The boys go to jail"" she tells Walt. She challenges a group of harassers on their alpha-dog posturing. Throughout the film Father Flanagan remains a thorn in Walts side. He promised Dorothy Kowalski hed keep spiritual tabs on her husband maybe even get him into the confession booth. Confessions come. But dont look for them to take place in the cathedral or end with a complement of Hail Marys and Our Fathers. There are clumsy moments to this racially charged parable written by Nick Schenk. For instance are Walts visits to his local barber (John Carroll Lynch) supposed to mitigate his fondness for ethnic slurs? You see he talks to his Italian barber and later the Irish foreman he introduces Thao to with the same sharp tongue. Its not racist. Its a type of blue hail-fellow-well-met banter. That argument is hardly convincing. Eastwood isnt just fond of this generation. The sturdy agile 78-year-old director is a card-carrying AARP member. Walt is a Korean War vet with a footlocker full of memories a silver star a rifle black and white photos from the war and from a lifetime ago. The vet still carries a lighter with the 1st Cavalry Division insignia. If the movie isnt ""post-racial"" perhaps its because Eastwood knows there are many Americans who will never quite be that. Their stories will collide with our fresher ones. ""Gran Torino"" is very much about the thing Eastwood knows most intimately -- movies. Like ""Unforgiven"" his neo-Western classic this film ponders the value of the yarns we spin about heroes and lawless encounters. On a street corner Walt confronts a trio of thugs. Will they make his day? You wonder. As Walt and Thaos relationship deepens the tensions with the gangbangers come to a boil. ""Gran Torino"" asks Do we need guys who ride in to save the day? Can they or do they hurry the conflict? The answers are powerful -- but hardly obvious. ""Gran Torino"" R for language throughout and some violence. 1 hour 56 minutes.

(Anthony michael rivetti/warner bros.) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / December 25 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + In the context of Clint Eastwoods career as a star an actor and a filmmaker ""Gran Torino"" is an endlessly fascinating movie. If only it were a good one.Eastwood of course has long since reached the point where he can do as he damn well pleases and one of the things that has pleased him in recent years is to drop a movie at the very end of the Oscar season and thoroughly reshuffle the field. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was one such movie; this awkwardly conflicted drama about inner-city racism struggle and redemption is not. Still if you want to see Dirty Harry collide with Eastwoods idea of the real world ""Gran Torino"" is something to see.In what he has announced is his final acting performance the star plays Walt Kowalski a Korean War vet and retired Detroit auto worker who has watched his inner-city neighborhood dwindle away until hes the last white man standing. The film opens with his wifes funeral - Walts dutiful blobby sons (Brian Haley and Brian Howe) drive in from the suburbs with their nasty little children - after which the widower retires to his front porch like an old soldier surveying the battlefield.Down the streets ride the gangbangers cruising like complacent sharks; the surrounding houses are filled with an influx of immigrant Hmong the mountain people of Southeast Asia. Walt looks at the mess the newcomers have made of their properties and growls. Really He growls like a cartoon dog.""Gran Torino"" shifts into gear when Thao (Bee Vang) the shy teenage boy next door is bullied by a Hmong gang into trying to steal Walts prize possession a green Gran Torino that sits shining and undriven in the old mans garage. Walt brought it off the factory line himself and so it stands for an entire vanished world - not to mention a vanished economy - thats well worth protecting at rifle point.To atone for Thaos shame his family orders him to help Walt out around the house whether Walt wants the assistance or not. (He doesnt.) The scenes in which the two come to know each other form the heart of ""Gran Torino"" and the scenes between Walt and Thaos sister Sue (Ahney Her giving the films breeziest performance) are the films brain. Upwardly mobile and brutally illusion-free Sue patiently instructs the retiree in the ways of her people and the ordeal of climbing up Americas ladder.Theres sentimentality to this story and its honest enough but Eastwood has decided to keep it at bay by making his hero an unapologetic venom-spewing racist. In part this keeps the audience off-balance because were never sure when and if Walt will disappear down the Korean foxhole in his mind. ""Gran Torino"" is alive to the web of racial and ethnic discontent in this country but the script by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson has a tin ear. When Walt and a barber friend (John Carroll Lynch) try to teach Thao how to cuss like a real man the humor of the scene works but the language is dreadfully forced - a screenwriters conceit of how ""real people"" talk.So much of ""Gran Torino"" plays like this - heartfelt and smart but with fatally off-kilter rhythms and thin unbelievable characterizations. (Would suburban parents really let a teenage girl wear a belly shirt to her grandmothers funeral? I dont think so.) Eastwood is consciously playing with stereotypes here up to and including a callow young priest (Christopher Carley doing what he can with a thankless part) but he only brings them partway into the modern world. Tonally the movies a botch - a melodrama that wants to be a work of realism but cant figure out how.One of those stereotypes obviously is the urban avenger Eastwood spent much of his early career establishing (with a lot more complexity than most critics credited him with at the time). Walt probably saw ""Dirty Harry"" more than once back in 1971 and its certainly how he thinks the world should behave. The real drama of ""Gran Torino"" lies in watching the characters black-and-white mindset melt away under a steady diet of Hmong home cooking replaced by a starker sense of duty.It works and it doesnt. The scene in which Walt faces down a group of street toughs harassing Sue is both gloriously funny and suspenseful because this old unbreakable man so completely crosses these bad boys wires. Yet as ""Gran Torino"" builds toward its conclusion everything Eastwood is trying to stuff into one simple movie - justice revenge melting-pot America career summation religion - topples over into something much too close to camp. Are we ready for the Last Temptation of Clint? Thats what we get here.Your reaction may depend upon how much affection you bring to this film for Eastwood the ornery intelligent movie icon and for Eastwood the questing filmmaker. Some people have come out of early screenings intensely moved others shaking their heads. The man has made the movie he wanted to so the only question remaining is whether you feel lucky. Well?

Eastwood who also directs plays Walt Kowalski an aging bigot increasingly dismayed by the ethnic changes in his neighborhood. Hes especially disturbed by the Hmong family who moves in next door right after his wife dies. But a friendship emerges with Walt becoming both friend and mentor to the teenage boy and girl living there. It seems far-fetched but Eastwood is fantastic as Walt his performance making up for the predictable turns in the story. The film begins with Walts wifes funeral where we meet his sons and their families; Walt shows his disapproval for his granddaughters fashion sense by literally growling. But its not just a pierced navel on display that bugs him. Everything does. A veteran of the Korean War still haunted by the horrors of battle Walt is simply an unhappy man. Only his dog Daisy seems to bring him any pleasure. Well Daisy and the cooler of beer and pack of cigarettes he keeps handy. He has no use at all for the family next door. But when a group of Hmong gangbangers tries to recruit Thao (Bee Vang) and the ensuing commotion spills onto his lawn Walt is suddenly involved in his neighbors lives. Later he rescues Sue (Ahney Her) Thaos sister from a menacing bunch; at this point hes Dirty Cranky Harry. But over time with traditional Asian food and Chinese beer breaking down his defenses Walt comes around. Is it a believable transformation? In almost anyone elses hands no. But Eastwood at times laugh-out-loud funny at others surprisingly ugly in what he says (occasionally both at the same time) makes Walts change seem genuine. Walt learns that as part of his aborted gang initiation Thao tried to steal Walts beloved Ford Gran Torino. As punishment Thaos family makes him work for Walt. Then the bonding begins in earnest with Walt trying to make the shy awkward Thao a little more like Walts idea of a man - which is to say more like Walt himself. Ominous foreshadowing eventually comes to fruition and things turn decidedly darker. Here too the resolution becomes obvious but its still fascinating watching Eastwood work toward it. Vang and Her are outstanding; Gran Torino marks the debut for both. Good also is Christopher Carley as a young priest Walt has little time for. The acting is in fact quite good throughout Eastwoods spare directing style serving the cast and the story well. Its tempting to look for deeper commentary about race and acceptance here but the story is told in such broad strokes that it dilutes whatever larger message the movie might have delivered. Still although Gran Torino isnt a masterpiece Eastwoods performance is masterful offering more than enough reason to enjoy the film.

In this image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Bee Vang left and Clint Eastwood are shown in a scene from ""Gran Torino."" Photo Anthony Michael Rivetti AP Movie review Clints Gran Torino a funny mix 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Gran Torino Drama. Starring Clint Eastwood Anhey Her and Bee Vang. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Clint Eastwood knows better than anyone else his meaning as an actor and his effect on audiences so its hard to believe he could direct ""Gran Torino"" without knowing how funny it is. He plays a racist old crank who sits on the porch drinking beer and grumbling about the Asians who have taken over his neighborhood. Seemingly just another grumpy old man he also happens to have an arsenal in his house and he walks around packing heat. The best moment in ""Gran Torino"" - actually one of the most delightful of the past month - comes when Gramps happens upon a street gang and prevents its members from assaulting one of his neighbors. ""Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldnt have f- with?"" he says in his cool growl. ""Thats me."" Except that its not him not really. That is not the old crank in the movie. Rather that is the Clint Eastwood of collective memory coming back to squint and sneer and look absolutely outraged almost crazed with disdain. Thats Eastwood the action star who was never above it all - whose ice-cold manner only barely covered his rage and amazement at the scum he found underneath the rock. Thats the Clint we like only 30 years later and stuck in a ridiculous movie. Last year Jack Nicholson made ""The Bucket List"" a so-so effort whose real agenda was actually kind of interesting. It posed a question about the Nicholson persona How does it deal with old age and how does it make it out of this world dignity intact? ""Gran Torino"" poses the same question with regard to the Eastwood persona or rather with regard to the most flamboyant aspect of his legacy What does a guy like Dirty Harry do when hes 78 and does he get to stay that way until the end? ""Gran Torino"" doesnt provide a sophisticated answer to that question. Instead a ham-fisted screenplay sets down the terms of the story with the obviousness of an old-fashioned play Walt (Eastwood) is a recent widower who is nasty to everybody. His adult sons are terrified of him. His slutty teenage granddaughter despises him but hopes hell die and leave her his pristine Gran Torino. He even insults the local parish priest. But then one day Walt inadvertently does a good turn for his Asian immigrant neighbors and gradually - grimacing and grumbling - he finds himself drawn into their lives. A bizarre but endlessly amusing aspect of ""Gran Torino"" is that Walt insults everyone he speaks to and yet most of the characters react to him as though they cant hear it - or as though they enjoy it like the front-row victims at a Don Rickles show. They smile as if he were joking but nothing on Eastwoods face indicates an attempt at humor. Its things like this that make ""Gran Torino"" either a bad drama or a brilliantly subtle comedy. Or both. Whatever it is its a movie for people who are interested in Clint Eastwood - not just his work but the whole Clint thing in the world. He deserves better than ""Gran Torino."" He deserves a ""True Grit"" or something on the order of ""The Shootist."" But then Eastwood was always funnier than Wayne always more complicated. His self-awareness is so acute that he can play up the iconic aspects of his legend (""Unforgiven"" ""Million Dollar Baby"") without narcissism and delve into self-parody without getting cute. Maybe this mixed-up and weird awful but awfully likable movie is what Dirty Harry had coming to him after all. -- Advisory This movie contains strong language and violence.

"Gran Torino Showdown in Motor City | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsGran Torino Showdown in Motor CityThe toughest hombre at the bijou this holiday season makes gun gestures with his hands and has a steed that barely moves.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 19 2008 Gran Torino (out of 4)Starring Clint Eastwood Bee Vang Ahney Her and Christopher Carley. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 116 minutes. At the Scotiabank theatre. 14A The toughest hombre at the bijou this holiday season makes gun gestures with his hands and has a steed that barely moves. He also has a heart that beats stronger than ever.Its the durable Clint Eastwood who transforms a stereotypical racist into a fully realized character in Gran Torino a thoughtful work that continues the actor/directors remarkable late-career surge. Brought to fruition in just five weeks of filming with a crackerjack cast of pros and newcomers the movie also ranks as one of the best of 2008.Advance word suggested another Dirty Harry sequel was in the works and the posters showing a snarling and shotgun-toting Eastwood certainly matched the mood of his most famous anti-hero.In truth its more in line with Unforgiven the understated 1992 western that won Eastwood Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. Theres a similar theme of reconciling past deeds and paying the toll that violence exacts along with a shared economy of lensing and dialogue. Eastwood seems to be channeling Archie Bunker in his depiction of Walt Kowalski a Korean War vet and retired Ford factory worker in suburban Detroit whose grim outlook on life has suddenly become a lot greyer.Walt has just buried his wife the sole love of his life leaving him with nothing but his modest home his aging golden retriever Daisy and his green 1972 Gran Torino a pristine auto he built himself but which rarely leaves his garage.Stubborn and unsentimental Walt is angered by his grasping sons and daughters-in-law who want him to sell up and move into a retirement home. Walt is also vexed by the changing ethnicity of his neighbourhood. Polish Irish and Italian immigrants are being replaced by newcomers from the mountainous Hmong regions of southeast Asia whom he refers to by every slur imaginable.Hes not looking for redemption certainly not the kind offered by the newly ordained priest (Christopher Carley) of the Catholic church that Walts late wife faithfully attended but which he avoided.All Walt wants to do is sit on his porch smoke his cigarettes and drink can after can of Pabst beer. But he keeps getting dragged into neighbourhood drama when a gang of hoodlums starts bullying the youngest of his new next-door neighbors - shy youth Thao Lor (newcomer Bee Vang outstanding) and his outspoken sister Sue (Anhey Her equally new and impressive). Walt becomes an unlikely local hero when he confronts the gang seemingly chasing them away with strongly uttered oaths and his trusty shotgun - plus that trigger-finger gesture which somehow manages to be much more threatening. But the deed ratchets up tensions putting more stress on the Lor family and making Walt a target.Gran Torino follows a predictable arc up to this point albeit a satisfying one as Eastwood and screenwriter Nick Schenk set the stage for the inevitable showdown. Comic and dramatic elements are nimbly balanced as Walt begins to realize that the neighbours bring him more happiness than his own kin ""I have more in common with these gooks than with my own spoiled rotten family.""The bonding deepens after an incident involving Thao and the Gran Torino - the result of further gang bullying - obliges the young neighbour to become Walts helper and protege with results both comic and moving. A scene where Walt and his Italian barber (John Carroll Lynch) good-naturedly try to toughen up Thao by subjecting him to slurs and taunts is indicative of the warm heart that beats inside Walts leather facade as much as hed hate to admit it.The outcome of Gran Torino upends expectations yet it makes perfect sense and turns the film into a parable for modern times. No tumbleweeds roll down Walt Kowalskis street but this is every inch a western set on concrete plains.Eastwood 78 has suggested this might be his final acting role but take that with a large grain of rock salt. A man this vital and deep has much more to give and that includes warbling the Gran Torino title tune as the credits roll leaving even the toughest of hombres a little misty-eyed.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 12 2008 537 PM Nun Better Meryl Streep in Doubt plus Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. By Dana Stevens Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius in Doubt Doubt (Miramax Films) has a flaw that movie critics will fall on like crazed Swedish vampires and most audiences wont care about at all Its a filmed play that feels like exactly that. Director John Patrick Shanley who adapted the screenplay from his own hit drama makes all the classic stage-to-screen mistakes. He writes in new characters to flesh out what was a spare four-person show; dutifully ""opens out"" the story by setting random scenes in public places; and hammers home thematic points with overly neat visual reinforcements. (When in trouble he cuts to a close-up of something a cross a cup of tea a trembling hand.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. So fine Cinematically Doubt is something of a dud. But if it remains a play its an ingeniously structured one with smart thought-provoking words spoken by fabulous actors and how often do most of us get to see one of those whether in three dimensions or two? If the foregoing disclaimer-laden rave didnt convince you let me put it another way In this corner in a nuns habit Meryl Streep. In that corner in a chasuble Philip Seymour Hoffman. Like another play recently translated to the screen Frost/Nixon Doubt turns head games into blood sport. Advertisement Its the early 60s just after the Catholic Church reforms of Vatican II and Father Flynn (Hoffman) is the hip new priest at a diocese in the Bronx. Hip by the standards of this hidebound lace-curtain Irish world means that he treats his congregation as human beings and writes sermons that bear some relation to their actual lives. Father Flynns popularity among the students at the local parochial school irks the principal Sister Aloysius (Streep). Shes an old-school Catholic ardently policing the line between secular and sacred. (Her dismissal of ""Frosty the Snowman"" as a ""pagan hymn"" is a comic high point.) A naive young teacher Sister James (Amy Adams who seems to be getting younger with each role) calls Sister Aloysius attention to a potential impropriety; Father Flynn has taken the parishs only black student (Joseph Foster II) under his wing calling him out of class for one-on-one meetings. Sister Aloysius jumps to the obvious conclusion but is it really so obvious? Thus begins an intricate spiral of insinuations accusations and counteraccusations that culminates in a standoff worthy of Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Streep plays her awful character (well great character; awful person) with compassion and loads of wit--she might be accused of having too much fun with the part but as with Mamma Mia I rather enjoyed being snowed under by the overbrimming force of Streeps personality. Viola Davis should be promptly FedEx-ed an Oscar for her one-scene showstopper as the boys mother. And Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to make the movies title mean something--only he knows what his character did with that little boy and hes not telling. Doubt would be my recommendation for the movie to see with your parents during this years holiday visit--not because priestly pedophilia is a hallmark of the Yuletide season but because this is the kind of film that sparks long conversations Not ""Thumbs up or thumbs down?"" but ""Did he do it?"" and ""Should she have pursued him?"" and that first of all religious and epistemological questions ""How can we ever know?"" Advertisement Slate V Critics on Doubt The Reader and The Day the Earth Stood Still Gran Torino(Warner Brothers) imagines what would happen if the classic Clint Eastwood hero--Dirty Harry Unforgivens Bill Munny A Fistful of Dollars Man With No Name--aged into a racist coot who sat on his front porch with a rifle and a six-pack decrying the invasion of his Detroit suburb by ""spooks"" and ""gooks."" Its not much of a stretch; many of Eastwoods iconic roles combine creeping racial anxiety with an element of vigilante justice. But Walt Kowalski a just-widowed Korean War vet with a grudge against his Hmong neighbors is Eastwoods furthest venture yet into the comic possibilities of his flintier-than-thou persona. Walt is a crank and a bigot but no fool; he can see that his nerdy teenage neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured to join a violent neighborhood gang. So Walt scares the gangbangers away with a vintage weapon and a world-class squint. He strikes up a reluctant friendship with Thao who helps him with household tasks and envies Walts mint-condition 72 Gran Torino. Thao learns the art of asking out girls and the efficacy of a well-timed dirty joke. Walt learns that ""gooks""--at least the unarmed studious kind--are people too. As for ""spooks"" ... well the jury remains out apparently. Eastwood fans will love this movie but I confess that Ive never been one of them. The man does have a priceless way with a dry putdown (the winner here has to be ""Good day Puss-cake"") and as an actor hes a master at riffing on his own cinematic myth. But I cant get past his lead-footed direction and the ponderous Manicheanism of his worldview. Gran Torino ends with a fantasy of vigilante violence that squanders all the goodwill its main character has spent the movie accruing. This is the better by far of the two movies Eastwood has made this year a stripped-down alternative to the overupholstered Changeling. But both movies share a moral vision--bad guys as leering sickos good guys (and girls) as sacrificial lambs--that shuts down the possibility of any real well doubt.

By David Denby Kate Winslet on the set.   Credit Photograph by Brigitte Lacombe It has become clearer than ever that the movie year is divided into two parts. Theres the first nine months which are filled it seems with big-audience digital spectacles about men who fly animated movies about indignant handheld devices and chatty rodents and all-male comedies about virgins lost in a condom factory. And then theres the Oscar-focussed final three months of the year which are devoted to movies about failure abjection death and the Holocaust most of them starring Kate Winslet or Cate Blanchett. ""Revolutionary Road"" from the celebrated Richard Yates novel of 1961 is one of the latter. It is honorably and brutally unnerving. Yet it may suffer as only an awards-season movie can from the illusion that pain and art are the same thing. The movie is set a half century ago--not in the actual nineteen-fifties but in the semi-mythical fifties of John Cheever Sloan Wilson and many other writers as well as Yates a time in which the orderly bedroom communities of New York and Connecticut were mourned as the national emblem of disillusionment and spiritual decline. Sam Mendes adapting Yatess book with the English screenwriter and novelist Justin Haythe has been in this suburban wasteland before in 1999 with ""American Beauty."" That movie was all stylized red and black surfaces. This time Mendes pushes the signature look of the fifties commuters in identical gray suits and hats pour like lava through Grand Central Terminal and settle to work in vast open floors with shaded glass partitions. Cigarettes are lit and furiously smoked before during and after conversation; Martinis consumed by the bucketful launch anxious bouts of adultery and heartrending quarrels. The movies central male figure is Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) a handsome young office worker with neatly combed light-brown hair and crisp white shirts. Several years earlier at a party Frank had spied a girl named April (Kate Winslet) a stunner with a long back and golden tresses; the hungry way they looked each other over on that occasion is meant to summarize for us the hopefulness and the erotic splendor of their early years together. The movie like the novel picks up with them in 1955 when they are living in a small agreeable house in Connecticut with their two children. April who wanted to be an actress has failed in that ambition and Frank is lazily and contemptuously working for the same business-machine manufacturer in Manhattan that his father had worked for. At the same time the Wheelers in revolt against the suburbs against conformity against playing it safe believe that they are marked for some extraordinary destiny. Somehow they will escape. As a couple they are the American descendants of Henry Jamess melancholy Londoner John Marcher from the novella ""The Beast in the Jungle"" a man who spends years preparing for the special fate that hes sure will spring at him from the wilds of life. The movie is driven however not by the hope of liberation but by a tense looming sense of disaster and part of our fascinated but fearful response to it is created by the sense that April and Frank are never at ease with each other. In the past Winslet has played American women without straining but this time she enunciates with laborious precision--you can see her propelling vowels and consonants like smoke rings. She and Mendes (her offscreen husband) have worked out a conception of April as a will-driven semi-hysterical female defined solely by her relationship with Frank. Forcing herself to extremes April is either electrified by her husband (""Youre the most beautiful thing in the world--a man"") or disgusted by him; she will turn him into a god or destroy him and Winslet keeps her back rigid her shoulders high her jaw set. DiCaprio by turns cocky supplicating and enraged gets the externals right but he seems a little afraid of revealing the depths of Franks shallowness. Frank is a liar an adulterer and a compromiser who betrays himself as much as his wife but DiCaprio projects a natural heroic sweetness--its in his movie-star genes--which in this case is at odds with the character hes playing. If you think of Paul Newmans acid moments in ""The Hustler"" and ""Hud"" you can imagine how the role might have been done. Henry Jamess antihero discovers his fate he is to be ""the man of his time the man to whom nothing on earth was to have happened"" an ironic catastrophe. Marcher suffers from an insufficiency of sexuality of vital spirit which is hardly the Wheelers problem but like him they have no idea what to do with themselves. Now the Wheelers dilemma is grounds for pathos or possibly turned a different way for satire but is it grounds for tragedy? The story works toward a gruesomely unhappy ending but I cant escape the feeling that both creator and re-creator have trapped an American couple in a grim overly mechanistic system of dead ends that reflects the artists own ambitions and temperaments rather than some stinging truth about American incapacity. Theres a sourness a relentlessness about the movie which borders on misanthropy. In both the social and the personal scenes the conversational tone veers between idiotic pleasantries and fathomless bile with nothing in between. Were middle-class people in the fifties really so stunted? The only character who consistently speaks with intelligence turns out to be not only crazy but destructive. (Hes played in a brilliant virtuoso turn by the scary-looking Michael Shannon.) By schematizing the books relationships and by cutting away Yatess extraordinary precision psychological nuance and eloquent sorrows Mendes has I think unwittingly revealed something unconvincing about the material. Just two years after Yatess book came out Betty Friedan published ""The Feminine Mystique"" whose resonant starting point is the puzzling misery felt by suburban housewives like April--women allegedly living the American Dream complete with wage-earning husband multiple children and good china. It would be inane to fault Richard Yates for not possessing an explicitly feminist consciousness but he never suggests that April suffers from even the slightest social constriction and neither does Mendes. April is isolated in her own neuroses and Winslet goes all the way into the kind of strident rage that is fuelled by excess; DiCaprio once baited stays with her. In scene after scene the two actors tear away at each other sometimes in tight closeup. Mendes is a man of the theatre and this movie I suppose is like a strong Broadway drama--clenched explosive and perhaps cathartic. But I dont think the turmoil of ""Revolutionary Road"" should be confused with movie art. In ""Gran Torino"" Clint Eastwood appears (symbolically) as the last white man in America guarding what might be called the last American car--an Army-green 1972 Ford Gran Torino lovingly preserved in a garage in run-down Highland Park just outside Detroit. The movie directed by Eastwood and written by Nick Schenk is set in the present when a Korean War hero and longtime Ford automotive worker Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) now a retired father of two grown sons his wife recently dead finds himself living next door to Hmong immigrants whom he towers over and bullies. The Hmong are the hill people of Thailand Laos and Vietnam who fought on the American side in Vietnam; some of them immigrated to the United States and they work hard but Walt calls them ""gooks"" and ""slopes"" and other bitterly pronounced tags from the rich American vocabulary of abuse. When young Thao (Bee Vang) from next door tries to steal the sacred Gran Torino Walt becomes enmeshed with the boys family first as antagonist and then gradually as fierce protector--so fierce that he gets caught up in the neighborhood gang wars with their escalating back-and-forth of beatings rapes and shoot-outs. Walt is meant to be the kind of fearless American whose strength is inseparable from his blighted vision of the world. He is obsessed with turf with right and wrong narrowly defined with male codes male lingo. The movie was not written for Eastwood but it still seems to be all about him--his past characters his myth his old role as a dispenser of raw justice. Growling and muttering Eastwood appears to be offering a satirical critique this hoarse-voiced glaring absurdly nasty old man is what Dirty Harry might have become. The movie which Eastwood directed with his usual vigor has plenty of violent scenes but its mostly a rueful comedy of enlightenment by degrees Walt comes to admire his neighbors; he realizes that he has more in common with their quiet self-discipline than with the hollow consumerism of his sons and their grasping kids. Walts final acts in the neighborhood struggles come as a shock but in retrospect they make perfect sense as Eastwoods personal renunciation of vengeance and also as a kind of down payment on an altered American future. The day-to-day difficulties and occasional exhilarations of urban multi-ethnic education have never been dramatized with half the power or the humor that the director Laurent Cantet (""Time Out"") brings to them in ""The Class."" The movie which won the Palme dOr at Cannes this year stars an actual teacher Francois Begaudeau who in 2006 published a book chronicling a year in the Paris public school where he teaches French. Cantet and Begaudeau along with Robin Campillo condensed and reshaped the material into a two-hour drama centering on the teacher and a small number of middle-school students (all played by real students though not the same ones Begaudeau wrote about). Begaudeau in his thirties is handsome lean and quick with a strong voice; the slouching or rowdy kids are mostly of African or Caribbean descent--though many of them were born in France they are still outsiders and rightfully touchy about it. Some of them are resistant to education which disrupts the pleasures of adolescence but Begaudeau goes after them aggressively challenging correcting teasing criticizing and they are alive to him and come back hard. Begaudeau a brave and candid man dramatizes his own failures as when he offhandedly compares some insolent girls to ""skanks"" and nearly starts a rebellion. He finds himself in the contradictory position of liberal authority he demands that the students not mope around in a recessive funk and instead become their authentic selves. But then empowered by his attention they challenge his control of the class. The climax of the movie is a wrenching episode in which a boy from Mali throws a tantrum and the school given its self-defining rules has to decide whether to expel him even though expulsion will probably send him back to Africa. In all ""The Class"" is a prime document of French post-colonial blues though its relevance to American urban education could not be any greater if it had been made in the Bronx or Trenton or South Los Angeles. I would be surprised if this brilliant and touching film didnt become required viewing for teachers all over the United States. Everyone else should see it as well--its a wonderful movie.

(Photo Niko Tavernise/Courtesy of Fox Searchlight) For two decades Clint Eastwood has shrewdly resisted making one more Dirty Harry movie Another cartoon vigilante picture wouldnt fit in with his Golden Years status as an American Master who continues to evolve revising his old meathead-genre tropes in ways that compel some auteurists to invoke the names of Dante and Shakespeare. But Gran Torino is his final Dirty Harry movie manque. His hero Walt is the same Cro-Magnon right-wing vigilante racist but this time like Prospero in The Tempest the old man is poised to abjure his magic (his magic Magnum) for the sake of the greater good. The movie is ludicrous but Eastwoods consistency is poignant. He has an agenda and sticks to it. He ought to have let someone else direct him thoughhis acting is all over the map. At his finest he delivers thesis lines the ones about how terrible it is to kill a manas Walt did in Koreawith the subtle but insistent quaver of a great jazz musician filling a measure to bursting His day wasnt made after all. But most of his readings would be too broad for even the movies he made with farting orangutans. From his porch Walt surveys the big family of Asian-Americans (Hmong) who live next door and Eastwood twists up his mouth and growls that all the real Americans have moved away and hocks a goober on the lawn. Grrrrr goddamned slopes hwick-pitooey. He upstages Walts dog who is mostly quiet. The script by Nick Schenk requires the just-widowed Walt to discover a newand betterfamily in those slopes to commit to them in ways he could never commit to his sons or overly entitled grandkids. So he teaches the boy (Bee Vang) to swear hurl racial expletives and pick up pretty girls. He gives him manly discipline. (You know something kid? Youre all right.) And he lets his softer side come out under the probing of the boys sassy sister (Ahney Her). Amid the culture-clash jokes a higher symbolism creeps in. When the family is imperiled by an Asian gang Walt responds in his macho-vigilante waythen seems to realize that as with the Vietnamese and Cambodians and Laotians the Americans supposedly fought for he has made their lives even more violent. The problem is that for all Eastwoods twilight-of-life ambivalence about his own mythical persona his is still a paranoid universe of predators and the preyed-upon so theres never a need for distracting shades of gray or the kind of every-man-has-his-reasons drama in every episode of The Wire. These are simpleminded moral dilemmas and the scenes with the Asian gang are almost as crude as anything in Sudden Impact. To think Gran Torino is a masterpiece you have to accept the contrived setups and sledgehammer melodrama. You have to grade the movie on that same meathead-vigilante curve. As Harry once said Mans got to know his limitations"" and Eastwood has a gift for making his look like brave artistic choices. Darren Aronofsky is our most brilliantly druggy filmmaker His syntax transforms to match his characters feverish perceptionsto pull you into their radically altered states. The nature of the drug is different in every movie swirling and fractured in Pi transcendentally romantic in The Fountain. In his new film The Wrestler he induces a state of masochistic ecstasythe oneness with the universe that comes from being pummeled and cut and watching ones blood fly onto the canvas. The tragic hero is Randy the Ram Robinson (Mickey Rourke) an aging pro-wrestler once a star with nothing real in his life but that Artaudian Theater of Cruelty in which men in mythically garish costumes perform brutal ballets before shrieking crowds. Beside Aronofskys bouts the ones in Raging Bull seem like Japanese tea ceremonies. No matter how choreographed the pounding is ferocious and we see the world through Randys swimming perceptions. Even cringing we feel his joy. He secretes a small razor in his costume and down for the count slices open his face to make the gore even splashier. We rise with him in triumph I bleed therefore I am. The movie isnt as world-shattering as those bouts Its a regretful-old-warrior weeper in which Gods loneliest man attempts to reconcile with the bitter child (Evan Rachel Wood) he abandoned and reaches out to the only woman who shows him affectiona stripper (the ever-comely Marisa Tomei) who has the grace not to let him see her eyes wander in search of other lap-dance customers. We know that even if he touches the strippers heart and breaks through his daughters anger hell screw it up because after all hes only good for one thing in life even if it kills him. Allusions to Christ are everywhere; the stripper talks about the carnage in The Passion of the Christ. Is Aronofsky being tongue in cheek? I dont think hes ever tongue in cheek.

Well use the best pics in an upcoming gallery. By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Though you can see his characters redemption coming a mile away Clint Eastwoods Gran Torino is still well worth the ride. TRAILER Preview the movie Eastwood plays a cantankerous and bigoted Korean War veteran and retired auto worker. He is equally nasty to the parish priest as he is to the immigrant family next door. He doesnt want to be bothered with any kind of niceties -- not even to his longtime barber who seems like the closest thing he has to a friend. He doesnt have much use for his children or grandchildren. Nor do they seem to feel much affection for him. The misanthropic and thoroughly un-PC Walt Kowalski is a facet of Dirty Harry with a permanently etched scowl. He does hold a few things dear his faithful Labrador retriever Daisy the memory of his beloved wife and his pristine 1972 Gran Torino a reminder of better times But hes haunted by memories of a Korean soldier he killed in combat. And he cant -- or wont -- get his head around the neighborhoods encroaching diversity. Chief among the newcomers are the Hmong immigrants who have moved in next door. Gran Torino is dark sometimes comically so. Walt is off-putting and his guttural growl defines his persona. But as did Eastwoods character in Million Dollar Baby Walt becomes an unlikely mentor to a young person at a crossroads. He slowly thaws and assumes an almost fatherly role to Thao (Bee Vang) the shy boy living next door who is terrorized by Hmong gangbangers. He also forges an avuncular bond with Thaos older sister Sue (Ahney Her) and finds meaning and goodness in a life that had come to seem purposeless. Told in a pared-down style this is a humanistic tale despite the racial epithets and violence. In some ways Eastwood is sending up his Dirty Harry image and in other ways hes magnifying it showing us the harsh realities in store for a man who takes the law into his own hands. Earnest and understated Gran Torino is an unflinching examination of themes that have fascinated Eastwood in most of his recent films family war loss faith and unexpected human connection.

Mark Kelly looks back at the series which includes The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Image Universal Pictures/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 29 2016 710 p.m. ET 69 COMMENTS Heres to truth in advertising. Go to the official website for "" Jason Bourne"" and what pops up immediately is a nonstop loop of riots raging fires car chases car crashes and brutishly ugly hand-to-hand combat interspersed with occasional glimpses of Matt Damons scowling countenance. Loops are by definition nonstop and the only way you can get rid of this one is to close the window. Still its a fair representation of the movie which puts its hero through a much longer loop of heavy-duty punishment interspersed with familiar sequences of omniscient electronic surveillance. Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human. Instead of using the last pieces of his self-discovery to open him up the film makes him more tightly shut down than ever a relentlessly grim avenger who wants to expose yet another nefarious program being hatched by a CIA that aspires to ""full-spectrum surveillance"" or watching everyone all the time. The chases are exciting up to a point; the director Paul Greengrass is a virtuoso filmmaker. But oh how they do vroom on. And when Bourne isnt being chased by a villainous agency assassin played by Vincent Cassel or by cops in various countries who do the agencys bidding hes being tracked by an array of technologies that give new meaning to whats become an obligatory phrase in high-tech thrillers ""Give me eyeballs on him."" (The most prominent snoops are the CIAs director Robert Dewey who is played by Tommy Lee Jones and his deputy Alicia Vikanders Heather Lee.) More Reviews Gleason Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films Those all-seeing eyes of a digital god include as in previous episodes satellites a seeming infinitude of CCTV cameras and facial recognition systems that can pick Bournes face out of every crowd he tries to hide in. Omniscient surveillance has to be sure become an action-thriller staple even though it drains suspense by making chases easier just as computers have weakened police procedurals by making investigations easier. Whats newish here is the numbing amount of time the film spends on people halfway around the globe watching Bourne on myriad screens while giving his pursuers turn-by-turn directions that Waze users could only dream of. If you want to be generous toward the all-the-worlds-a-network screenplay that Mr. Greengrass wrote with the films editor Christopher Rouse its a lively sampling of themes ripped from the headlines or from classic films cyberwarfare; Edward Snowden; ""The Terminator"" (the villain drives a destructo truck); ""The Manchurian Candidate""; the cybersecurity conflict between personal privacy and public safety ( Riz Ahmed is Aaron Kalloor aka Steve Zuckerberg Gates a Silicon Valley titan whos been in bed with the CIA and wants to climb out). But if youre not feeling generous--and I leaned to the Not side after less than an hour--its a collection of repetitive tropes that Mr. Rouses pumped-up editing has turned into a two-hour version of a 100-yard dash. ( Barry Ackroyd did the flashy cinematography.) Watch a film clip from Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. Photo Universal Pictures Mr. Damon is as always a strong presence; its remarkable that he can do such a buoyant man on Mars and such a dour Jason Bourne. Ms. Vikander taking over where Joan Allen left off makes up in appealing ambiguity what she lacks in Ms. Allens steeliness. Julia Stiles is back and welcome as Nicky Parsons. Mr. Jones has been made up--some of that is makeup isnt it?--to look like a cross between Lucifer and Nixon and he does his airy-authority number with well airy authority. He also gets--and earns--what is by my count the only laugh in the entire film. You dont go to a Bourne movie to laugh of course but neither do you go to get worn down. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Martian (2015) Matt Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt just struggle to survive on Mars after his crew assumes he has died during an epic storm and leaves him behind. He lives a rich intense life sustained by wry humor piercing intelligence and an irrepressible spirit of invention. Knowing the premise wont prepare you for the remarkable variety and complexity of this sci-fi extravaganza which Ridley Scott directed from Drew Goddards exuberant adaptation of the Andy Weir novel. 42 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

No Eastwood at the absolute top of his game as an actor isnt playing his most iconic character again. But theres more Harry than Archie Bunker in Walt Kowalski a misanthropic and racist retired Ford worker. Newly widowed Walt disdains his two ""spoiled"" sons who drive foreign cars and their families. He repeatedly turns away overtures from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) a concerned priest he ridicules as a ""27-year-old virgin."" Walt a Korean War veteran reserves special contempt for the Hmong family next door and all of the Asian-Americans who dominate his longtime Detroit neighborhood. Eastwood skillfully comes within millimeters of self-parody as the beer-drinking Walt who in the astute script by newcomer Nick Schenk serves as a pointed commentary on Dirty Harry Callahan. Its also a terrific career-capping role for Eastwood who claims hes now retired as an actor. He shows off his comic chops more fully than in any film since ""Bronco Billy"" more than a quarter-century ago. Its not all laughs of course and a coughing fit in the very first scene telegraphs that Walt may not have forever to come to terms with his personal demons. The vehicle for his redemption is a bunch of Hmong gangbangers. When they make the mistake of forcing Walts teenage next-door neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) to steal Walts beloved 1972 mint-condition Gran Torino the old man pulls out his rifle and other artillery and faces down the intruders. This turns grumpy old Walt much to his annoyance into a most unlikely neighborhood hero. And hes even more surprised to find he has more in common with Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) than his own kin. Walt even helps Thao get a job - although first Walt has to ""man him up"" in the funniest scene by teaching the teenager to trade racist epithets with Walts barber pal Martin (John Carroll Lynch). Quickly shot over the past summer ""Gran Torino"" is so loose-limbed it could easily be mistaken for a newcomers Sundance Film Festival entry rather than the years second release (after the big-budget ""Changeling"") from a 78-year-old icon whos been directing movies since 1971. I mean that as the very highest compliment. Eastwood obviously put a lot of effort into working as a director with the Hmong none of whom are professional actors. It pays off with a very funny and touching movie that delivers its message of tolerance with a most agreeable light hand. GRAN TORINO Magnum farce. In English and Hmong with English subtitles. Running time 116 minutes. Rated R (profanity and racist epithets violence). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Union Square.

But in front of the camera the 78-year-old actor still appears able to demolish anyone who messes with him which is why this showcase works as well as it does. His performance is the movies centerpiece and as you might expect its just tough enough to hold everything together.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski a grizzled Korean War vet who has never been the most sociable of men. When his beloved wife dies he becomes downright ornery pushing away his grown kids the local priest (Christopher Carley) and his neighbors a family of Hmong immigrants that includes teenage Thao (Bee Vang). Walt just wants to be left alone but his plans go awry when Thao tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite. Since Walt is played by Eastwood in Dirty Harry mode the gangbangers soon learn a lesson theyre not likely to forget. But much to his own surprise (if not ours) Walt learns a few lessons too as he tries to teach the confused Thao what it means to be a real man.Its difficult to separate this film from the others Eastwood has made as both actor and director. Its clearly a career-capping work and the wry ornery star turn at its center outshines many of the films flaws. With Eastwood having recently suggested that this may be his final onscreen outing Walts fierce ability to stare down brutal gangsters does feel a little like an icon acknowledging his own legend. And why not? Eastwoods earned that right and he knows it. Besides whos going to tell him otherwise?

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Walt Kowalski growls a lot -- a dyspeptic rumble that wells up from deep inside his belly when he catches sight of his midriff-baring teenage granddaughter text-messaging her way through her grandmothers funeral or when his good-for-nothing son and daughter-in-law suggest that Walt sell his house in a gang-infested corner of suburban Detroit and move to one of those Plasticine retirement homes that in the brochures look ever so nice.Like a lot of characters Clint Eastwood has played in his six-decade screen career Walt Kowalski is a man outside of his own time clinging to a bygone way of life that might never have been quite as he remembers it -- a man who senses on some deep inarticulable level that he has outlived his own usefulness. Hes a little bit of ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan brandishing his disgust (and his firearm) at the unsightly blemishes of a value-less society; a little bit of Million Dollar Babys Frankie Dunn the run-down boxing trainer whos been as much of a disappointment to himself as to his estranged family; and more than a little bit of Unforgivens Bill Munny the has-been gunslinger haunted by the sins of his past but unable to refuse one last ride in the saddle. And much like those movies Gran Torino -- the 29th film Eastwood has directed and the first he has starred in since Million Dollar Baby -- is about what happens when circumstance hurls Walt Kowalski into direct conflict with the present.Like Unforgiven Gran Torino begins with the death of the Eastwood characters unseen but implicitly saintly wife after which Walt only has eyes for two things -- his faithful canine companion and the gleaming 1972 Ford Gran Torino that sits in his garage a reminder of the now-defunct assembly line where Walt spent most of his adult life. Back then the Motor City was a factory town and Walts neighborhood an enclave of the sons and daughters of European immigrants. Now those same streets have been taken over by another immigrant population -- the Hmong people of China Thailand and Laos who fought on ""our"" side during the CIAs Vietnam-era shadow wars even if to Walt theyre no different from the ""jabbering gooks"" he fought against in Korea. At first Gran Torino shows us the Hmong exactly as Walt sees them -- a nondescript bunch of strange animal-sacrificing savages just over the fence. And they for their part view him with equal suspicion.As Walt rants about the ""zipper heads"" dragging down the neighborhood brushes off the barely postpubescent priest who comes around (on deathbed orders from the late Mrs. Kowalski) to give Walt confession and growls some more Gran Torino looks to be shaping up as something of a gently un-PC (Did Clint Eastwood really just say ""spooks""?) geriatric crowd-pleaser of the Space Cowboys variety. And if thats all you want or expect of Gran Torino then thats exactly what it will be -- no matter that Eastwood for whom moviemaking has long been symbiotic with his love of jazz merely uses the bass line of a butt-kicking Clint Eastwood action movie to play a series of complex variations on his career-abiding themes.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Mostly Gran Torino is a two-hander between Walt and the literal boy next door -- an introverted fatherless Hmong teen Thao (Bee Vang) who caves to pressure from a gangbanger cousin and tries to steal Walts car in a botched initiation rite. Gradually and grudgingly Walt takes the boy under his wing takes it upon himself to ""man him up"" a bit and teach him (in one of the films shrewdest funniest scenes) ""how guys talk to each other"" -- but only after Walt first steps across the property line and into the Hmong world. At its most didactic Gran Torino has Walt stare into a mirror and realize that he has more in common with these ""foreigners"" than he does with his own flesh and blood but more often the movie works by subtle implication. Where Korea was Walts war Vietnam was the Hmongs. Both understand that a man who has seen war can never not be that man and that the kind of absolution Walt Kowalski seeks wont be found in a confessional.This is hardly the first time Eastwood has played a man with a shadowy past but rarely have the shadows been so vividly illuminated (no matter the directors trademark preference for chiaroscuro lighting). ""We used to stack fucks like you five feet high in Korea and use you for sandbags"" Walt barks while shoving his old M-1 in the face of one of the gang members who continues to terrorize Thaos family -- a moment (one of the finest Eastwood has ever acted) that echoes the image of the Iwo Jima survivor stirred from a nightmare at the start of Flags of Our Fathers. Only Walt Kowalski is wide awake and the nightmare is still unfolding.Unlike most contemporary Hollywood and Hollywood-style filmmakers Eastwood (here working from a generally superb script by newcomer Nick Schenk) isnt naive or reductive enough to suggest that the solution to deeply embedded conflicts between races classes or entire social orders is a mere car crash (or Brecht poem) away; that if we just sat down and talked to each other wed be able to dissolve all that stands between us. An unmitigated social realist (who would never be so obvious as to make an overtly social-realist movie) Eastwood understands that the only real ""change"" in people and societies amasses infinitesimally through hard-gotten experience and that some things in life are destined to remain immutable.""The thing that haunts a man most is what he isnt ordered to do"" Walt says in Gran Torinos defining scene and the thing that haunts Eastwood -- has haunted him for the better part of his filmmaking career -- is the legacy of American violence and the false heroic myths on which that legacy has been written. For him romanticized movie violence long ago lost its allure and at least since Unforgiven the act of killing another human being has been depicted as one that puts a knot in mens stomachs and leaves a permanent scar on their pscyhes. In Gran Torino that strain of investigation reaches its apotheosis in an inversion of Unforgivens climactic barroom standoff a scene that brings the curtain down on Eastwoods cycle of urban crime films as hauntingly as the earlier one did on his Westerns. (""Extraordinary events culminate in what may seem to be an anti-climax"" a Hmong shaman advises Walt early in the film. He doesnt know the half of it.)Im not sure if Gran Torino is Eastwoods ""best"" film to whatever extent such trivial distinctions matter. Certainly its a rougher less formally elegant one than the masterly Unforgiven and A Perfect World. But especially when viewed in light of this years earlier Changeling (which on the surface looks like the more ""important"" movie) it seems like one of Eastwoods most personal right down to his raspy warbling of the self-penned end-credits song. Above all it feels like a summation of everything he represents as a filmmaker and a movie star and perhaps also a farewell. ""That"" future generations of fathers will someday tell their sons ""is what Clint Eastwood was all about.""GRAN TORINO | Directed by CLINT EASTWOOD | Written by NICK SCHENK from a story by DAVE JOHANSSON and SCHENK | Produced by EASTWOOD ROBERT LORENZ and BILL GERBER | Released by Warner Bros. | ArcLight Hollywood AMC Century City Mann Criterion Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Gran Torino | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gran-torino ) Gran Torino (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Gran Torino is an amazingly over-the-top anti-racism parable but despite its obvious shortcomings it is nevertheless effective and affecting. The storytelling style is old fashioned in what it does and unsubtle in the way it goes about doing it and Eastwood doesnt plumb any new depths in his stereotyped portrayal of the films central character. Yet perhaps because the ending doesnt unspool quite as expected and perhaps because the film has something to say (even if it is presented with a heavy hand) its hard to deny that Gran Torino works on a certain level. This is far from Eastwoods best work as a director but its a respectable effort and is more successful that his tepid earlier 2008 effort Changeling. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an unpleasant old coot. Following the death of his wife he has lived alone with his dog. He is barely on speaking terms with his sons and grandchildren and the neighborhood in which he lives is changing becoming more ethnically diverse and troubled by gangs. He has a less-than-cordial relationship with the Asian family next door and it becomes even colder when the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts to steal Walts 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation. He fails when Walt shows up with a rifle. Later when the gang members arrive to give Thao a ""second chance"" and a fight breaks out Walt and his rifle are again on hand and he drives the gang-bangers off. This results in Walt playing the role of reluctant hero. He is soon visited regularly by Thaos smart and spirited older sister Sue (Ahney Her). And Thao as a penance for his attempted theft is forced to work for Walt. This leads to some bonding and a growing realization on Walts part that as long as the gang is around Theos future is not secure. Gran Torino uses the familiar cross-generational buddy formula as its foundation. As Walt imparts important life lessons to Thao (including how to interact with others in a ""manly"" fashion) Thao opens the heart of the bigoted misanthrope. Ultimately this becomes a story about overcoming prejudice. In this the film lathers things on a little too thickly. The transformation occurs too easily and with too little motivation. Yes Walt gains his redemption - which is the point of the movie - but its questionable how effective the screenplay is in selling that redemption. Maybe we buy into it because of Eastwood or because we always like to see Scrooge wake up on Christmas morning and save Tiny Tim. Speaking of Eastwood his name has been mentioned alongside the phrase ""Best Actor nomination"" in a number of places but to award the venerable filmmaker/actor with such a tribute in this case would be an injustice. Eastwood is playing a variation of Dirty Harry - a hard-bitten loner who at times is so over-the-top nasty that he borders on self-parody such as when he literally growls when someone does something of which he disapproves. While its true that the character arc forces Walt to exhibit a new open-mindedness theres nothing exceptionally complex in Eastwoods approach to the material. He played a similar role to better effect in Million Dollar Baby. While Eastwood may not deserve acting plaudits a case can be made for his two Asian co-stars. As Thao Bee Vang shows more growth and development of personality than Walt. He and Eastwood evidence the right amount of chemistry - certainly enough to allow us to believe that they care for each other against all odds. Ahney Her is a real find - bright and energetic she brings pizzazz to the role and shines brightest during a scene when Sue is giving Walt a walk-through of her house and parrying his racist remarks with well-aimed quips. Walt and Thao may be Gran Torinos lead characters but Sue is the one were most likely to remember long after the end credits have expired. The film gets points for its unconventional resolution which I will not disclose here. Suffice it to say that this is a rare movie that doesnt implode during the last reel; the filmmaking team obviously put some thought into the best way to construct the conclusion. There are some emotional moments and tears are not necessarily inappropriate although as previously mentioned its questionable whether the movie earns all of the tissues that will be used on its behalf. As parables go this one is almost shockingly obvious but in thinking about it its not that far away from Million Dollar Baby with both films featuring key interactions between Eastwoods character and a priest. And while Eastwood may not turn in a great performance hes a strong reliable presence whose participation somehow makes it okay to shed those tears. Despite its flaws I appreciate Gran Torino although I do so more with my heart than with my head.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Anthony Michael Rivetti) A- Gran Torino Genre Action/Adventure Drama; Starring Clint Eastwood Brian Haley Cory Hardrict; Director Clint Eastwood; Author Dave Johannson Nick Schenk; Release Date Limited 12/12/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 12 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Gran Torino takes its title from a 1972 Ford beaut parked in a driveway -- a fetish object and memento mori in this curious striking drama directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. He plays Walt Kowalski a widowed retired autoworker alienated from his grown sons and just about everybody else. Walt spends most of his time growling tinkering mowing his postage-stamp lawn and raging against a world thats changed and wont change back no matter how hard he glares. Change has certainly come to his run-down Detroit neighborhood Hmong immigrants with strange foreign ways have moved in. Next door theres a fatherless multigenerational family that includes a quick-witted daughter (Ahney Her) and an uneasy younger teenage son (Bee Vang) who struggles to steer clear of the local Hmong gangbangers pressuring him to join them. Walt thinks people stink. Hes obnoxiously rude to a baby-faced Catholic priest (Christopher Carley with the puss of a young Spencer Tracy) who fulfilling the dying request of Walts late wife urges the SOB to go to confession. And the character regularly lets loose with such a vile spew of racist epithets that its clear Eastwood is looking to inflame the PC ears of a contemporary audience. Then when someone attempts to steal Walts prized car the coiled Korean War vet reaches for his weapon. (A different Eastwood in a different movie might have rasped ""Do you feel lucky?"") But in the aftermath of his rage -- as if breaking and entering were the only way to open the old mans emotional door -- this twisted post-9/11 version of Dirty Harry warily develops a relationship with the strangers next door. The connection leads to -- well to a shocking spiritual salvation in fact. And to gang warfare. And to a movie at once understated and radical deceptively unremarkable in presentation and ballsy in its earnestness. Dont let the stars overly familiar squint fool you This is subtle perceptive stuff. Eastwood has devoted his recent work to refracting the image of American men in decline. His movies pared and sinewy in both production and performance style (with the exception of the 2008 showpiece Changeling) meditate on compromises and losses and even (most memorably in Million Dollar Baby) on serious questions of religious faith. Gran Torino though grafts those signature late-career preoccupations onto a story thats got the energy of a gangly youth right down to the naturalistic performances by the mostly nonprofessional Hmong cast. The inquisitive script is by newcomer Nick Schenk from a story by Schenk and fellow first-timer Dave Johannson -- two talents lucky to dodge the indie virus that would surely have hit them had they aimed their script toward Sundance cred tidy and full of lessons. Hey punks Do ya think many Sundance smoothies would dare set Dirty Harry among the Hmong? Well do ya? A?

At 78 perhaps the only actor in the history of American cinema to convincingly kick the butt of a guy 60 years his junior the hard-headed snarly mouthed Clint Eastwood of the 1970s comes growling back to life in ""Gran Torino."" Centered on a cantankerous curmudgeon who can fairly be described as Archie Bunker fully loaded (with beer and guns) the actor-directors second release of the season is his most stripped-down unadorned picture in many a year even as it continues his long preoccupation with race in American society. Highlighted by the stars vastly entertaining performance this funny broad but ultimately serious-minded drama about an old-timer driven to put things right in his deteriorating neighborhood looks to be a big audience-pleaser with mainstream viewers of all ages. In his first screen appearance since 2004s ""Million Dollar Baby"" Eastwood revives memories of some of his earlier working-class characters; Korean War vet Walt Kowalski suggests a version of what Dirty Harry might have been like at this age and there are elements as well of the narrow-minded authority-driven figures in ""The Gauntlet"" and ""Heartbreak Ridge"" as well as those films humble settings and plain aesthetics. His wife freshly in her grave and his two sons upscale families uncomfortable around him Kowalski has impeccably maintained his modest suburban Detroit home while every other house nearby has gone to seed. A lifelong auto worker after his Army stint Kowalski has seen his contemporaries die off or move on replaced by immigrants and assorted ethnics he despises. His racist mutterings which employ every imaginable epithet for Asians are blunt and nasty but Eastwood grunts them out in an over-the-top way that provokes laughs and his targets are no less sparing of him. Particularly irksome is the family next door. To Kowalski they are generically Asian but they are specifically part of the sizable local Hmong population mountain folk from Laos Thailand and elsewhere who sided with the U.S. during the Vietnam War and understandably fled when the Yanks pulled out of Southeast Asia. Residing in the rundown house are a granny a mother and two teenagers retiring boy Thao (Bee Vang) and more assertive girl Sue (Ahney Her). Visitors often congregate at the home and Kowalski imagines them eating dog (he has one) and pursuing other unwholesome activities. But the sole genuinely unsavory element is a bunch of Hmong gangbangers hot to recruit the leaders cousin Thao. ""Get off my lawn"" Kowalski menacingly snarls when some commotion spills onto his property in what will no doubt become one of the films trademark lines and the cagey coot makes it clear hell be gunning for the hot-rodding hoodlums if they bother him again. The pivot in Nick Schenks lively neatly balanced screenplay (which was allegedly not written with Eastwood in mind although its a mystery who else could have played the lead) has the gangstas forcing Thao to prove himself by stealing Kowalskis cherry 1972 Gran Torino. When the alert old soldier catches him at it Thaos tradition-minded family insists he work off his shame at the victims pleasure. Reluctantly at first Kowalksi has him make repairs around the neighborhood thereby initiating a quasi-father-son relationship between extremely unlikely prospects. More melodramatically Kowalski also becomes a protector of sorts to Sue whom he rescues from some taunting black street kids in a scene that echoes previous scenes in Eastwood films in which the hero dares badass types to take him on. Beginning to take an interest in his young charges Kowalski learns from Sue that among Hmong kids in the U.S. ""The girls go to college and the boys go to jail."" Once he spends more time with the siblings and sees their desire to raise themselves up Kowalski admits that ""I have more in common with these gooks than with my own spoiled rotten family."" Thus is launched a character arc that will strike some as so ambitiously long as to seem far-fetched for such an old mentally entrenched man. But Eastwood makes it appear plausible -- as if once Kowalski has seen the light everything that comes afterward is clear almost preordained. Religion hovers in the background; a very young priest (Christopher Carley) determined to fulfill the final request of Kowalskis wife to get her husband to confess keeps getting the door shut in his face the old man feeling he knows a lot more about life and death than this green seminary product. Climax is heavier and more sobering than expected but its quietly foreshadowed by narrative and character elements. While ""Gran Torino"" is entirely of a piece with Eastwoods other work it also stands apart from his artful films of the past six years in its completely straightforward unstudied style. To be sure there are themes and understated points of view most fundamentally about the need to get beyond racial and ethnic prejudice the changing face of the nation and the future resting in the hands of todays immigrants. In a way that clearly could not have been intended Eastwood could be said to have inadvertently made the first film of the Obama era. Eastwood has dealt very intelligently and matter-of-factly with race throughout his career -- in ""Bird"" ""Unforgiven"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" among others -- and in this respect the key scene here is one in which Kowalski takes Thao to an Italian barber and with the intention of making him ""man up"" teaches him the relevant ethnic insults which in his world everyone should be able to withstand and humorously throw back at the perpetrator. For the two older adults its a game -- a rite of passage that incorporates a healthy if superficially abrasive acknowledgment of their differences. Eastwoods initial vocal rasp moderates over time just as his character softens toward the seeming aliens who surround him. There is probably no leading Hollywood actor with less ham in him than Eastwood -- just compare him to Jack Nicholson or Al Pacino for starters -- but by his standards this is a real barn-burner; grumbling under his breath or merely looking askance at the perceived lowlifes that litter his existence Eastwood clearly relishes this role and conveys his delight to the audience to great satisfaction all around. Hmong roles were filled by nonpros and quite adequately so. A bit characterless at first Vang ultimately comes into his own as a 16-year-old forced into lifes crossroads while Her capably embodies a girl with more spirit than judgment. Carley plays right into his priests naivete while John Carroll Lynch has fun as the old-school barber. Shot over five weeks in Detroits Highland Park neighborhood the pic is efficient and modest in all production departments. Editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach brought it in crisply at under two hours.
