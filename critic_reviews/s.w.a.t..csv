Comments S.W.A.T. The 70s cop show S.W.A.T. ran for less than two years but its held in tender regard by a sufficient number of closet fascists to have triggered this big-screen revival. As summer shoot-em-ups go this is pretty well executed with plenty of macho posing and gunfire. (Theres also a chase scene through the LA subway--a subtle stratagem on the criminals part since most Angelenos are unaware of its existence.) Samuel L. Jackson stars as the rascally captain of the SWAT team; among his charismatic storm troopers are Colin Farrell LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez (Girlfight). Clark Johnson whose HBO movie about the Montgomery bus boycott nabbed a 2001 Peabody Award directed. PG-13 111 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for S.W.A.T.

"S.W.A.T. fascist and politically correct? Slate Sign In Sign Up S.W.A.T. fascist and politically correct? S.W.A.T. fascist and politically correct? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 8 2003 1033 AM S.T.I.N.K.S. The high crimes of S.W.A.T. By David Edelstein A weak S.W.A.T. team Given that we live nowadays under constant threat of a terrorist siege its probably natural--it might even be therapeutic--to learn to love our cultures pervasive paramilitary rescue fantasies even to wallow in them. Well maybe not but if I was going to write a review of S.W.A.T. (Columbia) this week I thought Id try to get into the spirit of the thing. I even curled up with S.W.A.T. magazine the other day. Its not related to the film; its just for SWAT guys and wannabe SWAT guys. It has a great ad for M-6 tactical laser illuminators with a picture of a pretty blonde in a nightgown sitting up in bed with her laser sight on some creep in the shadows--its like ""Rape this scumbag."" The actual caption is ""Protect Whats Yours""--which could either mean ""your woman"" or in the unlikely event the reader is a female ""your maidenhead."" Advertisement Hows the movie? Not boring. Its cut very fast so that it gets your adrenaline up. It has a lot of training sequences like something youd see if the NRA had its own music-video channel. I got excited early on because I was starting to think of Los Angeles (where the movie is set) in terms of sectors and modes of incursion which is unusual for me. The cast is not what youd expect based on the 70s TV show. It has Samuel L. Jackson as the avuncular fascist commander--the John Wayne part if this were an old cavalry movie except that Wayne liked his black guys cooking the beans. The Duke wouldnt have known what to make of the Latina woman on the team Michelle Rodriguez (surly but sexually available) or the rapper LL Cool J. And the hero is that Irish party animal Colin Farrell who isnt the first guy youd to trust with plastic explosives. Farrell would be more at home in the botched but stirringly unfashionable Buffalo Soldiers running some tank into an oil refinery and incinerating everything for several square miles. This is not your fathers SWAT team--its not even your gay uncles SWAT team. But its values are comparable. S.W.A.T. is a peculiar hugely commercial mixture of red-meat action and rainbow coalition. This movie quite nakedly wants to appeal to male female urban rural right and left. It makes jokes about the loss of civil liberties but its only the criminals who get holes blown in them and the film has a villain that everyone can hate the French. Yes the bad guy is an irritating French drug dealer played by Olivier Martinez whom you might remember as the irritating French book dealer that all the men in the audience wanted to kill in Unfaithful (2002). Hes too French hes too pretty and hes screwing our women. That hes a terrible actor seems in context a misdemeanor. S.W.A.T. takes a freaky turn at the halfway point. Youre expecting this super-duper hostage thriller. But then the French guy gets captured and he yells at the TV cameras that anyone who breaks him out gets a hundred million dollars. So it turns into this crazed urban guerrilla picture with all the human maggots coming out of the woodwork with rocket launchers and M-16s. Our guys (Farrell Jackson Rodriguez J) have to fight them off in waves--and fight off some turncoats on their own side with an eye for the mother lode. It sounds like a video game and it could be except that its poorly designed. The director a TV guy named Clark Johnson doesnt shoot action very well which is sort of a handicap. Some of the bad guys--the baddest bad guys--get blown away and you dont even realize they got blown away until a beat or two later. Plus there arent enough SWAT tactics on display--and I know this is true; I read S.W.A.T. magazine. The climax is two stunt guys in silhouette pounding each other with lead pipes while a freight train bears down on them. I admit it I was all revved up to have a whale of a fascist good time and S.W.A.T. left me let down and pissed-off. I dont know what to do with all this manic energy. Oh hold on I still have S.W.A.T. magazine. That is one beautiful assault rifle. ... David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Robert Koehler 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 8 2003 | 1200AM PT In an era of hyper-powered action spectacles ""S.W.A.T."" arrives looking stodgy without exciting heroes or villains or especially the kinetic cinema to make it memorable. Nonetheless this widescreen adaptation of the mid-1970s TV series is smart to be flagrantly unfaithful to the short-lived show. In an era of hyper-powered action spectacles ""S.W.A.T."" arrives looking stodgy without exciting heroes or villains or especially the kinetic cinema to make it memorable. Nonetheless this widescreen adaptation of the mid-1970s TV series is smart to be flagrantly unfaithful to the short-lived show. Pics early August release date seems ideal to grab moviegoers fatigued by sequels. But coming in the wake of the physically astonishing ""Bad Boys 2"" ""S.W.A.T."" seems square making it likely that B.O. firepower will be contained to the opening week and briefly beyond with more flurries down the road in vid precincts. In contrast to the borderline insanity of danger and extreme action arranged by Michael Bay in ""Bad Boys 2"" tyro director Clark Johnson strives for realistic detail and action. Unfortunately such adherence to technical purity proves to be a weakness for the movie. Johnson who has superbly parlayed his stint as a Baltimore cop in ""Homicide Life on the Streets"" into a terrific small screen directing career and has shown a knack for depicting finely drawn characters in high-pressure situations is too often at the mercy of a generally hackneyed script. Actions starts with a sequence clearly borrowed from a spectacularly militarized North Hollywood bank robbery in 1997 climaxing with the wounding of a hostage thats blamed on S.W.A.T. partners Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner). Told by Capt. Thomas Fuller (Larry Poindexter) that he can earn a second chance on S.W.A.T. by fingering the short-fused Gamble Street complies earning Gambles permanent enmity.Whether or not this choice troubles Streets soul is a matter for a different movie since hes next seen working out on the beach with hopes of getting back into the fold while he temporarily does desk work. Street catches the eye of Sgt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) who was transferred from some unexplained exile in LAPDs Rampart division to head a fresh S.W.A.T. squad -- much to the dismay of his former partner Fuller. The mechanical ways in which Streets desire for a comeback are shown to match Hondos -- as well as the intro of each member of the squad -- tends to make pics first hour drag. Throwing together young brawny egos -- including the unnaturally subdued James Todd Smith aka LL Cool J as Deke and Michelle Rodriguezs Chris Sanchez the first to crack S.W.A.T.s glass ceiling -- would seem to offer fodder for incendiary witty exchanges. It doesnt.Genuine tension briefly surfaces during the squads final test before being sent to the streets as the unit breaks the ""course record"" for freeing airline hostages in a mock crisis which Johnson cannily stages in real time. But it isnt until the entry of nefarious international bad guy Alex (""Le Loup Rouge"") Montel (Olivier Martinez) that ""S.W.A.T."" breaks free of its episodic narrative for extended sequences that show Johnson to be a good if not yet inspired handler of contempo action. Nabbed by cops for document problems Montel tries to escape with help from his henchmen. After his second capture he offers a reward of 100 million to anyone who will help free him again. Twist doesnt prove as engrossing as might have been expected and leads to some easily anticipated character betrayals played out in murky nighttime conditions worsened by what appeared to be a poorly timed color print provided at the review screening. Jackson and Farrell remain consummate pros throughout but clearly have no new ideas for playing cops. Perhaps because of her characters novelty Rodriguez comes off as more relaxed than in some of her previous post-""Girlfight"" work and Renner (recently stunning in ""Dahmer"") does his part to keep things as interesting as possible. As the umpteenth cop thriller staged in L.A.s streets pic doesnt create a captivating new angle as for example Michael Mann did in ""Heat"" or to a lesser degree Antwone Fuqua did in ""Training Day."" A talented production crew including lenser Gabriel Beristain editor Michael Tronick and composer Elliot Goldenthal has done better work elsewhere. The vast song selection is more inspired with well-chosen tracks from the Rolling Stones Jimi Hendrix Apollo Four Forty and even an end-credit tune titled ""Samuel Jackson.""

There have been far worse movies this summer but the best justification for seeing this spinoff of the mid-70s TV series is if your date or mate is holding you hostage in the theater. Colin Farrell plays an ex-Navy SEAL in S.W.A.T. By Merrick Morton Columbia Pictures Samuel L. Jackson plays a self-assured lieutenant nicknamed Hondo who has been re-recruited against the wishes of a self-aggrandizing paper-pusher (Larry Poindexter) to lead the LAPDs S.W.A.T. team with his own handpicked recruits. This smug boss man is such a one-dimensional paper villain that you cant believe -- after the movies fairly realistic opening bank holdup -- that this guy could ever have been promoted above a Police Academy farce. Poindexter also has it in for a demoted S.W.A.T.-ster played by Colin Farrell but Jackson wants this ex-Navy SEAL big time. The team also includes LL Cool J as a family man and Girlfights still-in-shape Michelle Rodriguez as a fanny-kicker whom the script supplies with a child apparently because the movie is bent on including a kids birthday party. Into all this comes a French international villain (Unfaithfuls Olivier Martinez) whose fortune is rumored to approach 1 billion. Review of the movie S.W.A.T. ( out of four) Stars Samuel L. Jackson Colin Farrell Olivier Martinez Michelle Rodriguez Jeremy Renner Director Clark Johnson Distributor Columbia Rating PG-13 for violence language and sexual references For a while the movie hops from the S.W.A.T. team bust du jour to Jackson on the golf course to Martinezs sinister behavior. Then the story tries to come together but minus any artful preparation Captured Martinez offers 100 million to anyone who can spring him. This sets up a stampede of so many people taking up the offer that you can almost envision embattled California Gov. Gray Davis saying ""I hate my life"" and electing to go for the gold himself. The team has its hands full as director Clark Johnson (of the much better HBO telepic Boycott) crashes a few more planes and cars. Better the money had gone to feed the hungry or provide Henry James books on tape for shut-ins. For a while though the verbal interplay has its moments a chance to see a twinkle-eyed Jackson in non-bellowing ""loose"" mode and the often stubble-ish Farrell after an apparent Mach3 razor makeover. The movie wont make any enemies but there isnt much difference alphabetically or otherwise between S.W.A.T. and ""so what?""

It was the aural equivalent of a gold medallion tangled in chest hair and once you heard it it never went away. This week with the arrival in theaters of the movie ""S.W.A.T."" the tune is back like one of those ghostly supporting characters who turn up decades later for a cameo and -- well you try getting it out of your head; clearly Im doomed. The movie wrapped up in all this nostalgia-pop actually isnt too bad though it has little in common with the TV series other than a few character names and a vague premise. ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson) a veteran LAPD sergeant with a few scores to settle is charged with creating a young kick-ass new S.W.A.T. team. He does so only to find his teams mettle quickly tested by an international drug lord (Olivier Martinez so swoonily handsome hed give the husband in ""Le Divorce"" a run for his money) whos offered 100 million to anyone who can help him bust out of jail. Movie review View trailer 1/2 ""S.W.A.T."" with Samuel L. Jackson Colin Farrell Michelle Rodriguez LL Cool J Brian Van Holt Olivier Martinez. Directed by Clark Johnson from a screenplay by David Ayer and David McKenna. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence language and sexual references. Several theaters. Director Clark Johnson is a movie novice but a TV cop-show veteran (Hes directed episodes of ""Homicide Life on the Streets"" ""NYPD Blue"" ""The Shield"" and others) and hes clearly comfortable with the material; the scenes between the cops have an easy camaraderie. He and the screenwriters are less successful with the movies occasional and mostly heavy-handed humor (Example One cop slams anothers head into a mirror but the potentially powerful moment is undercut by the sudden appearance on the soundtrack of the Stones tune ""Shattered""). As is common with this sort of ragtag-team-makes-good story much time is devoted to the assembling of said team with Jackson presiding over them like an amused football coach. Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is a maverick cop whos been stuck in the ""gun cage"" after a controversial shooting got him yanked off a previous S.W.A.T. mission. Deacon ""Deke"" Kaye (LL Cool J) is an agreeable family man who likes to show off his nicely cut abs. And Chris Sanchez is -- surprise -- a woman (Michelle Rodriguez) who conveys her own considerable toughness with a steely gaze and extremely tight tank tops. They train they fire guns they bond at the local bar (at which they triumphantly sing the ""S.W.A.T."" theme music just in case we were in danger of forgetting it) they triumph in a dry run they confront the swoony French guy. Along the way cars planes and trains crash fires are started and people jump from high places; its all quite watchable and occasionally diverting like a good-quality TV cop show blown large. As summer popcorn movies go you could do worse than ""S.W.A.T."" particularly if you keep a close eye on Farrell. The dark-eyed Irish actor had a similar role in ""The Recruit"" -- another young man in training not quite formed not quite controlled. But watch him in a tiny scene early on as he says goodbye to a former girlfriend; its a note-perfect moment full of regret and rueful tenderness and not-quite-love all squeezed into about three seconds. This guy has big-star charisma and this movie cant quite hold him; maybe the next one will.

Starring Samuel L. Jackson Colin Farrell LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by Clark Johnson. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Samuel L. Jacksons smile suggests more and has more meaning than anything in the story screenplay and direction of ""SWAT."" The same could be said for Colin Farrells stillness his air of integrity and for Michelle Rodriguezs glower She just lifts her head and gives that slack-jawed hostile glare and for a while theres the illusion of watching a better movie. Good film actors can do that. They promise pleasure and delay the moment when the audience realizes as in the case of ""SWAT"" that the story is going nowhere that the action is absurd and uninspired and that the people who made it are probably on a foreign vacation right now faintly embarrassed and waiting for the whole thing to blow over. ""SWAT"" is better than ""Gigli"" but so is most outpatient surgery. Its the combination of personalities that gives an audience hope for ""SWAT. "" Jackson plays Hondo a wild-man veteran who pulls together from the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department a team of elite talented and committed cops. Farrell as the earnest Jim is one of them. So is Rodriguez both tough and girly as Sanchez the only female member. These actors buy the film an hours worth of indulgence and the presence of LL Cool J helps as well -- or rather the promise his presence implies. In fact Cool J does little in the movie but stand around during group scenes. But then ""SWAT"" is full of unfulfilled promises. Olivier Martinez (""Unfaithful"") plays a French gangster who shows up in the United States and on his first night in Los Angeles slashes his crime-boss uncles throat during dinner. ""You take my money I take your life"" he announces. That introduction sets up an expectation that the gangster is about to do something dastardly and catastrophic. He might even be a terrorist. Instead hes stopped for a bad taillight and spends most of the movie in an orange prison jumpsuit. The movie also sets up the expectation of a romance between the characters played by Rodriguez and Farrell. They go out for a drink they flirt and he pays her a visit the next day. Could this be? An emotional dimension to the story plus a chance for Rodriguez a terribly underused actress to sound some new notes? No that element is dropped too. The fire bell is rung and everybodys off racing for the climax. It should be noted that the defects of ""SWAT"" are present from the beginning and that less reflexively optimistic souls should know the score from the first scene. The film begins in the midst of a violent hostage situation but neglects to tell us anything about the hostage takers or the hostages. Quite an oversight. In a sense the opening is like the yang version of the opening of Woody Allens ""Interiors"" in which we see a woman talking about her life and sobbing. Who is this woman? Who are these hostages? In each case the filmmaker is more concerned with the spectacle of the action and not the meaning of it and as a consequence the action is without meaning. Another early sign that ""SWAT"" may be heading into trouble comes when Hondo is described by a starstruck underling as ""Old-school SWAT -- the gold standard."" Thats two cliches in six words. Is three even possible? Its indicative of the films general ineptitude that though the filmmakers hasten to let us know which character drinks Dr Pepper and likes fast food they never inform as to why the French gangster is a menace to society or why we should care whether hes locked up or goes free. The movie also makes a profound miscalculation in that it assumes late in the game that the films primary rivalry is between Jim and a rogue-cop former partner (Jeremy Renner) and not between Jim and the gangster. This comes as news to the audience. In the end though sifting through the defects of ""SWAT"" is like looking at a rubble pile and saying ""The problem here is no foundation."" In truth theres nothing here at all no basis for a drama certainly. What the movie has is Jackson Farrell Rodriguez Cool J and Martinez -- good actors who deserved a real movie. This film contains extreme violence and mild sex banter.

"CNN.com - Review A solid S.W.A.T. - Aug. 7 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review A solid S.W.A.T. Script is laughable but director actors make it work By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Farrell lead the team in ""S.W.A.T."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- Who do the cops call when they need help? Apparently they dial up the Special Weapons and Tactics unit better known as S.W.A.T. What does Hollywood do when it needs a film with built-in appeal? It takes an old TV show from the 1970s and makes it into a major motion picture. What do you get as a result? You get ""S.W.A.T."" starring Colin Farrell Samuel L. Jackson Olivier Martinez and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by television director Clark Johnson (best known for his acting in the series ""Homicide"") and written by David Ayer (""Training Day"") and David McKenna (""American History X"") ""S.W.A.T."" is one long adrenaline shot that never takes itself seriously and never pauses long enough to worry about making much sense. Making the team Farrell plays Jim Street who at the beginning of the film is a member of the S.W.A.T. unit. But after his partner Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) disobeys orders and shoots a civilian during a hostage crisis Street is demoted and Gamble is fired. The S.W.A.T. unit is trying to solve the problems caused by a drug lords (Olivier Martinez) offer to pay 100 million to anyone who can free him from custody. Street seems to be lost in the system until a new S.W.A.T. commander Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Jackson) rescues him and makes him part of his new unit. This part of the film feels a lot like a remake of ""The Dirty Dozen"" as Harrelson picks a series of misfits and turns them into killing machines. Soon Street is a happy camper running around the training center and shooting and stabbing dummies to his hearts content. Harrelson also picks the first female member of the unit Chris Sanchez (played with her trademark intensity by Rodriguez). His other recruits include David ""Deke"" Kaye (LL Cool J) Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt) and T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles). The good guys are in place. Enter the one-dimensional evil villain the notorious drug lord Alex Montel (Martinez). Montel is pulled over during a routine traffic stop and arrested when his identity cant be confirmed. After his real name is discovered hes soon paraded in front of the press -- and he blurts out an offer he hopes someone cant refuse. He offers 100 million to whomever can break him out of jail before hes turned over to the federal government. Action building Suddenly its ""Who Wants to be a Multi-Millionaire Day"" in L.A. as various gangs and lowlifes attempt to free Montel forcing the S.W.A.T. unit into overdrive. But the real threat occurs when a former S.W.A.T. member joins the game and meets the unit with their own tactics and their own systems. Soon automatic weapons exploding buildings burning cars -- even Lear jets landing on freeways -- fill the screen as the mindless action builds and builds. It finally ends with ... well you get the picture. Led by Jackson and ably assisted by Farrell the entire cast turns in solid believable performances. But with dialogue such as ""Youre either S.W.A.T. or youre not"" or ""OK guys this is what we trained for"" its an uphill battle to take this script seriously. ""S.W.A.T."" is a perfect example of an August film release. During these dog days of summer brainless popcorn-chomping entertainment is what some people are looking for. ""S.W.A.T."" fills the bill pretty well. ""S.W.A.T."" opens nationwide on Friday August 8 and is rated PG-13.

Merrick Morton) B S.W.A.T. Genre Action/Adventure Mystery and Thriller; Starring Colin Farrell Samuel L. Jackson Josh Charles LL Cool J Olivier Martinez Jeremy Renner Michelle Rodriguez; Director Clark Johnson; Author David Ayer David McKenna; Release Date Wide 08/08/2003; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted August 7 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT In a nod to the macho 1970s ABC cop-drama series from which it draws its hormonal attitude S.W.A.T. retrofits several of the movies key players with character names from the old TV police files. Samuel L. Jackson takes Steve Forrests spot as Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson leader of the Special Weapons and Tactics team whose job it is to bust into dangerous situations where LAPD regulars fear to tread in trip-wired Southern California. Colin Farrell inherits Robert Urichs part as Jim Street handsome brunet maverick. Josh Charles and James Todd Smith (a.k.a. LL Cool J) become T.J. McCabe and Deacon ""Deke"" Kaye. (Owners of great-TV-music CDs are now invited to break into cascades of duh-duh-DUH duh-duh-DUH from Barry DeVorzons catchy original theme music. Okay now stop.) They might well be cats from the 70s era of big sideburns and race riots themselves this current brigade of armor-wearing men who talk in silent hand code and carry big mean weapons on the job. As it is the standard-issue feature-length made-for-summer 2003 edition of ""S.W.A.T."" - written by David Ayer (""Training Day"") and David McKenna (""American History X"") and directed by sometime actor and savvy cop-story specialist Clark Johnson (""The Shield"" ""The Wire"" ""Homicide Life on the Streets"") - is essentially a fancied-up TV episode. The big team assignment at hand involves guarding an international mobster (""Unfaithful"" Frenchman Olivier Martinez) who has craftily stirred up citywide unrest among thugs with his played-to-the-media offer of 100 million to anyone who springs him free from prison. ""Oo do we ave to pay? Oo do we ave to keel?"" the suave baddie asks his lawyer demonstrating a Yankee practicality that belies Martinezs Euro-romantic long hair Gallic stubble and sleepy smirk. ""S.W.A.T."" is however indeed a movie and moreover a movie for our time at the very least in a socio-Hollywood way. (The producer is that tactical-minded impresario of ""The Fast and the Furious"" Neal H. Moritz who specializes in the joys of the cinematic low-riding obvious.) And as such the new-millennium ""S.W.A.T."" provides entertainment quite apart from the diversion of flashy action sequences (including a chase through L.A.s underground storm drains and the rescue of mock hostages on a commercial jetliner as part of a reassuring training test) and loving attention to the mechanics of weaponry. The way I watch this action thriller is as a field guide to perceived current audience tastes in casting characters and storytelling style. Such tactics There is for starters a serious sectarian premium placed on spiritual redemption and family values - subtle to be sure but unrelenting. The good are rewarded. The bad are punished. The partying is PG-13. Street is a scrapper not just for the hell of it (taciturn iconoclasm suits Farrells scruffy handsomeness and the Irish actor seems more at ease than ever portraying rule-breaking American men) but because of a conflict (and a disagreement about honor and ethics) with his ex-partner (""Dahmer""s Jeremy Renner). Hondo too carries a moral back history and faces off with a prissy departmental captain (Larry Poindexter) who roots for his nemesis to fail. A prayer for redemption bonds Hondo and Street as powerfully as a love of gadgets that go boom - Jackson and Farrell bond comfortably too giving off a happy collegial vibe. A desire to be a good family man keeps Smiths Deke sweet and funny even when hes tough. (Look for Rod Perry the TV series Deacon in a cameo as Dekes father.) We know ""S.W.A.T."" is a movie for today because the team now includes a tough buff young woman (Michelle Rodriguez still hired to snarl and throw punches three years after ""Girlfight""). There has never in fact actually been a female S.W.A.T. member in Los Angeles but these focus-group times demand the role-model fantasy - better yet a single mom who draws inspiration from a photo of her little girl but draws strength from major rounds of ammo. We also know ""S.W.A.T."" is aware of its own cuteness because the dialogue plays by the rules of meta-entertainment. ""They only roll in John Woo movies not in life"" one S.W.A.T.ter disdainfully says of a fellow trainee who spins on the ground during a run-and-shoot exercise. ""Id get Halle Berry as my yoga instructor"" Deke fantasizes of the pleasures he could buy with the 100 million bounty. When the movies arsenal of Special Weapons and Tactics runs low a perp is cuffed with his face squashed into ""Jeopardy"" host Alex Trebeks star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and we laugh. Thats another way to tell were not in 1970s cop-TV world anymore Theres a thin blue line between saving lives and cracking jokes.
