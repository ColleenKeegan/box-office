Comments (1) The Possession Video Rated PG-13  92 minutes  2012 The young daughter of divorced parents is possessed by an evil spirit and spooky stuff ensues. Screenwriters Juliet Snowden and Stiles White add some interesting elements such as a monster that comes from Jewish rather than Christian mythology and a surprisingly sensitive depiction of how divorce impacts children. Yet director Ole Bornedal doesnt add a single idea of his own cribbing the movies eerie lighting schemes from David Fincher (Zodiac) its hyperrealist mise-en-scene from Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) and most predictably its disquieting intimacy from William Friedkins The Exorcist. Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives a touching performance as the father whos struggling to restart his life as a single man while Kyra Sedgwick does what she can with the mother a misogynistic stereotype of a cold vindictive divorcee.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick are fine as the parents of a girl (Natasha Calis) inhabited by an evil dibbuk released from an old wooden box and Calis is appropriately creepy as that increasingly malevolent kid.

In William Friedkins ""The Exorcist"" Max Von Sydows Father Merrin stepped right up to the plate when Linda Blair began doing some pretty nasty things with a crucifix. The problem is a little less straightforward - and less overtly symbolic -- in ""The Possession"" A young girl starts acting strangely after she picks up an unassumingly sinister-looking tchotchke at a yard sale. The item in question is a Dibbuk Box -- according to Jewish folklore a cask containing a malevolent spirit thats just waiting for the right human host to pour itself into - and believe you me only a shmendrik would try to open it. Or perhaps a curious little girl. In ""The Possession"" that little girl Em (Natasha Calis) is still adjusting to the breakup of her parents marriage; Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are themselves still trying to work out the particulars of their divorce and the atmosphere of unrest is just the sort of place for a restless demon to take root. When Em and her sister Hannah (Madison Davenport) go to visit their dad on the weekend the spanking-new house hes just bought is ghost-free -- in this case Em brings the ghost with her inside that box. Its a dark wooden thing adorned with mystical symbols and Clyde cant open it not even with all the manly dad tools he has lying around the house. For Em on the other hand it springs open easily but only after shes alone in her room at night. Inside she finds an ancient-looking ring set with some kind of coin a giant tooth and -- well you really dont want to know. The first half of ""The Possession"" is suitably atmospheric and reasonably creepy. Director Ole Bornedal (who made the 1997 thriller ""Nightwatch"") knows that the scariest things are the ones we only half-glimpse or those were made to wait for. (One of the most devious little sequences in ""The Possession"" involves Ems investigating the choking sensation in her throat by shining a pen light down there. Never has a uvula looked so foreboding.) It probably doesnt hurt that Sam Raimi is one of the movies producers -- that may account for the pictures shivery sense of restraint. Theres no real gore here (as long as youre not too perturbed by the occasional bleeding eye) and theres no undue sadism (animal lovers should note that no sweet family dogs are sacrificed even though one of the notable features in Clydes new house is a doggy door). In fact ""The Possession"" has a lot going for it particularly as shot by Danish cinematographer Dan Laustsen He makes the sanitized freshness of suburbia with its tract houses and buzz-cut front yards look doleful. And Morgan with his great basset-hound eyes is convincing even when hes dealing with the most gibberishy dialogue or reading self-seriously from the Old Testament in an attempt to drive the evil out of his sickly bedridden and suddenly foul-mouthed daughter. But problems pop up like cardboard Halloween-house spooks in the movies second half around the time Clyde realizes something is supernaturally wrong with Em. The casting of reggae and hip-hop artist Matisyahu as the only Hasid fearless enough to tangle with the diabolical dibbuk was a miniature stroke of genius Matisyahu may not be the most skilled actor but hes serene and understated just the kind of guy youd want around if nasty clattery insects started flying into and out of your daughters mouth. But as the picture winds toward its conclusion Matisyahu and the rest of the cast fall prey to a host of dorky special effects and even dorkier dialogue -- not to mention a billowing prayer shawl used for dramatic effect -- that undercut the muted chilliness of the movies first half. ""The Possession"" save for a surprise coda ends with a bunch of excessively windblown actors and a heap of stiffly recited incantations. Feh For this I went to college?

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 31 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 30 2012 517PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Ole Bornedal Written by Juliet Snowden Stiles White Starring Natasha Calis Jeffrey Dean Morgan Classification 14A Genre horror Year 2012 Country USA Language English ""Ive never seen anything like it before"" gasps a horrified character in The Possession.Clearly she cant be referring to the film in which she appears. Lazily directed by veteran Danish filmmaker Ole Bornedal - making his American studio debut like so many well-meaning European genre specialists before him - the film is basically a compendium of possessed-child cliches reaching back to The Exorcist. Screen grab from the online trailer for the horror film ""The Possession"" Movies The Possession The official trailer Madison Davenport left and Kyra Sedgwick in a scene from The Possession. video Video Kyra Sedgwick reveals her love of horror films In the sole inspired moment Bornedal sees William Friedkin and raises him topping the earlier films nightmarish medical examination sequence with a scene in which haunted cherub Emily (Natasha Calis) is subjected to an MRI scan; suffice it to say that what shows up on the glowing-green readout screen is beyond the realm of any biology textbook.Elsewhere The Possession scrapes the bottom of the demonic barrel littering its soundtrack with cryptic whispers and throwing in some CGI pestilence to suggest a malign presence. As in The Exorcist the culprit is a body-hopping demon but the Catholic spook tactics have been replaced with Hebraic mysticism - in lieu of Pazuzu were given a dybbuk a creature of Jewish folklore last spotted in the Coen Brothers A Serious Man.And as in The Exorcist its suggested that the bad spirit was invited into the characters lives by a weakened family unit Emilys parents Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) are in the midst of a nasty divorce and her older sister Hannah (Madison Davenport) is a moody strident preteen just for good measure.Morgan who looks like a stockier Robert Downey Jr. is forced to do most of the actorly heavy lifting here looking shocked at regular intervals by his younger daughters transformation into a cackling raw-meat-devouring little monster obsessed with the old wooden box she picked up at a yard sale (if the film has a moral it seems to have something to do with avoiding bargain-hunting at all costs). Suffice it to say that the actor seems to be suffering at least as much as the character whose job as a high-school basketball guru is the only interesting thing about him (a scene where Clyde instructs his charges to run drills with an invisible ball could be the beginning to a decent inspirational-coach flick).Sedgwick has even less to do saddled with a role that requires her to be as stubborn and clueless as possible until the sheer proliferation of weirdness convinces her that something worse than a feckless ex-husband is to blame for her kids malady.On a technical level The Possession is a mess It has a nice overcast colour palette but Bornedals disinterest in the story manifests in oddly timed blackouts and some truly half-hearted exposition in a dimly lit Brooklyn synagogue. (A filmmaker with a sense of humour could have knocked that one out of the park).Whatever one thinks of the Paranormal Activity films they prove that its possible to generate tension and the odd truly startling moment without resorting to gore or excessive special effects. By contrast this thriller merely feels innocuous Nothing to fear here.

BOTTOM LINE A little humor helps liven up this trite tale though genuine scares are in short supply. CAST Jeffrey Dean Morgan Kyra Sedgwick Natasha Calis LENGTH 133 Another horror movie about a little girl possessed by a demon? Seriously? Well only half-seriously and thats the saving grace of ""The Possession"" a story so overly familiar that director Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch"") figured he might as well have fun with it. That seems like the right approach to a script that includes a mysterious box a malevolent spirit and a stormy streamy exorcism. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Written by Juliet Snowden and Stiles White ""The Possession"" faithfully follows the blueprint of its genre beginning with the once-strong but now strained family unit. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick play Clyde a workaholic basketball coach and his ex-wife Stephanie who share custody of cheery little Em (Natasha Calis) and pouty tweenage Hannah (Madison Davenport). Its Em who brings the spooky box home from a yard-sale and unwittingly opens her soul to invasion. Pretty soon people start seeing things Ems voice gets weird Clydes house is plagued by moths -- you know the drill and ""The Possession"" knows that you know. It barely bothers to tell a story but instead shuffles various vignettes into a greatest horror-hits playlist. Still Bornedals camera is such a likable ham constantly sneaking up on folks and watching their eyes go all buggy that its hard not to chuckle along. Morgan (""The Watchmen"") is rather charming as Clyde; Sedgwick is rather less so as the snippy ex-wife though that may be her function. A twinkly eyed Jay Brazeau livens up the dreary role of the folklore professor who has to explain the obvious and Matisyahu the Jewish rapper is one of the films genuine bright spots as Tzadok a twitchy hip-hop Hasid from (where else?) Brooklyn. Movies18 scariest horror movies of all time ""The Possession"" may not be very scary but it can be mildly entertaining.

At least this years ""Exorcist knockoff has one novel twist -- it introduces whats apparently the screens first Jewish exorcist. Too bad he doesnt make an appearance until midway through this otherwise unremarkable and none-too-scary horror movie. For far too long upstate suburbanites Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan blame their recent divorce for the increasingly bizarre behavior of their 11-year-old daughter Em (Natasha Calis who is no Linda Blair). The youngster has opened an old wooden box with a Hebrew inscription that her father bought for her at a yard sale unleashing an evil spirit called a dybbuk though the movie takes forever to explain this to us. As the dybbuk begins taking control of poor Em she stabs her basketball-coach dad in the hand with a fork and hundreds of moths fly out of her mouth. Her parents are so busy arguing about restraining orders they dont even notice that the hand on which she wears a ring from the box is turning blue. Well after she starts babbling incessantly about ""my friend in the box her moms boyfriend finally suggests that Em ""needs to see somebody. This character a dentist soon finds himself in need of extensive dental work courtesy of the dybbuk. The script credited to Juliet Snowden and Stiles White adheres so closely to formula that its possible to predict not only which characters will end up dead but in what order -- beginning with Ems unfortunate African-American schoolteacher. Danish director Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch) finally goes off autopilot when Dad susses out Ems malady and heads for Borough Park Brooklyn in search of a Jewish exorcist he found on the Internet. ""This must be left to the will of God proclaims the Hasidic rabbi. But the rabbis hipper son -- played by the singly named Hasidic reggae-pop star Matisyahu -- is up to the challenge and agrees to visit them. He explains to Ems dad that hes even allowed to ride in a car on the Sabbath in contravention of Jewish law ""when a human life is in danger. Thats what I love about this job You learn something every day. Matisyahu is no Max von Sydow but he does provide the film with some much-needed energy. His characters final confrontation with the dybbuk is directed by Bornedal with effects-driven panache otherwise missing from the proceedings. ""The Possession claims to be ""based on a true story. But a quick perusal of the Los Angeles Times story cited as a source in the press notes reveals the dybbuk may be little more than an elaborate Internet hoax concocted to sell an antique wine box.

Actually the dybbuk is the second malevolent force to attack Clyde and Stephanie (Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick) and their two daughters. First came the monster called divorce. Clyde a basketball coach who tends to lose track of time when hes at practice has been banished for being inattentive. But he dotes on 10-year-old Em (Natasha Calis) and 13-ish Hannah (Madison Davenport) whenever he has temporary custody. So he agrees to stop at a yard sale the girls want to visit and doesnt argue when Em insists on buying a dark wooden box inscribed with Hebrew letters. Translated they probably read ""Youre an idiot."" Clyde and the girls havent been warned but the audience has. The movies prologue reveals what happened to a woman who tried to destroy said box. Plus an introductory note proclaims earnestly that the story is based on ""true events."" Anyone who actually believes in dybbuks and other ghoulies will find ""The Possession"" terrifying. For the rest of us the movie is a cleverly constructed well-paced piece of hokum. Director Ole Bornedal a Danish film veteran is craftier than most of the young pups making horror pictures these days and Juliet Snowden and Stiles Whites script actually tells a story rather than just stringing together a series of loud noises and shock cuts. As you may have guessed from the title Emily becomes possessed by the dybbuk that was locked (not very well) inside the box. Science cant help her and neither can family court. So Clyde whom Stephanie blames for Ems problems makes a frantic drive to Brooklyn seeking help from Hasidic rabbis. Most of them shy away but one person agrees to help a tzadok (""righteous man"") named Tzadok. Hes played by of all people Hasidic reggae star Matisyahu. ""The Possession"" hits a few contemporary notes. Rather than move to an old dark house after the divorce Clyde buys a brand-new home in a housing-bubble graveyard full of half-finished abandoned structures. And the girls are vegans upset whenever an animal is killed -- even if the critter is a demonic familiar. The movie also relies on the usual scare-flick conventions notably the tendency of characters (especially those most at risk) to enter darkened rooms. When Tzadok starts chanting in Hebrew his words arent subtitled. But ""let there be light"" would certainly be appropriate.Contains violence and disturbing themes.

"Movie review The Possession scares are better than most - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review The Possession scares are better than mostJeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick are a divorced couple whose daughter is taken over by a dybbuk. Sam Raimi produces.August 30 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Matisyahu left Natasha Calis center Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick... (Diyah Per / Lionsgate )Moving into a creepy unfinished subdivision then bringing home a spooky religious relic seem like not the smartest decisions but no one ever makes horror movies about the best way to raise your credit score or get along with the new boss at work.A better-than-most fright-time tale the new supernatural thriller ""The Possession"" begins with the recently divorced Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) trying to get along to lessen the strain on their two daughters.Their youngest Em (Natasha Calis) buys an odd wooden box at a yard sale and soon begins acting strangely because naturally she has been overtaken by an apparition of Jewish legend known as a dybbuk.Directed by Danish filmmaker Ole Bornedal (1997s ""Nightwatch"") and produced by Sam Raimi ""The Possession"" offers a few small-scale scares but its not quite clear if the Brenek family is Jewish so the idea of belief and true faith is never part of the equation. The dybbuk just is.(The idea of a dybbuk was used to a more comedic and philosophical effect in the 2009 Coen brothers movie ""A Serious Man."")The film is the sort of classically minded horror tale that Raimi in particular seems to favor. Bornedals Danish films are likewise moody chamber pieces and here he creates a sustained sense of mounting dread though the movie is kind of stolen by the Hasidic rapper Matisyahu as the hip son of a rabbi who helps perform an exorcism to put that dybbuk back in his box.Matisyahu seems to be performing at a different temperature than everyone else in the cast keeping it cool and laid-back while the other actors huff and puff their way through.mark.olsenlatimes.comThe PossessionMPAA rating PG-13 for mature thematic material involving violence and disturbing sequencesRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSam Raimi-produced The Possession has spooky real-life...August 29 2012Movie review The LosersApril 23 2010Supernatural A little horror movie every weekSeptember 13 2005Lights Camera Lawyers?December 10 1997MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentMatisyahuCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-possession-movie-review-20120831,0,5417384.story",200,thepossession7,thepossession,latimes

(Understandably the promotional campaign for this movie has emphasized producer Sam Raimi but he didnt write it or direct it and it never feels much like his work.) This is a lugubrious lovingly crafted B movie with more than a little 1970s flavor but no arch postmodern attitude. Is it great cinema or even a picture youll remember clearly this time next year? Maybe not but ""The Possession"" is beautifully photographed and well cast with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick as a depressed divorced couple whose younger daughter meets a most unwelcome new friend. Furthermore it delivers its shocks masterfully and without overkill and offers a new twist on the familiar exorcism formula.Im not going to claim that theres never been a Jewish-themed demonic-possession movie before since thats probably not true -- every arcane corner of human religious and spiritual belief has been plumbed by horror screenwriters at some point. (In fact I dimly recollect a Judeo-centric parody of ""The Exorcist"" released on LP that my big brother owned. Anyone?) Here writers Juliet Snowden and Stiles White take the genuine concept of the ""Dybbuk box"" demonic containers made of ornamented wood sometimes found in the 18th- and 19th-century shtetls of Eastern Europe and run with it. More interesting still is Bornedals portrayal of the Hasidic community in Brooklyns Borough Park neighborhood where Morgans stricken dad finally finds a rabbis renegade son - played by Matisyahu the ex-Hasid alt-rock artist - to help cast out the evil one.By the time Em (Natasha Calis) a girl of 9 or 10 picks out the odd-looking box at a suburban garage sale we already know its extremely bad news thanks to an actual 1970s prologue sequence. We also know that Em and her older sister Hannah (Madison Davenport) are suffering through their parents dreary divorce which has exiled Clyde (Morgan) their shaggy basketball-coach dad to a brand-new house in a distant outer suburb and led their thin-lipped mother Stephanie (Sedgwick) to shack up with an irritatingly cheerful orthodontist (Grant Show). I have the feeling that Ive seen the orthodontist-as-inadequate-stepfather gag played out before in other divorce movies but it still works. I apologize in advance to all those who practice this noble and helpful profession but doesnt the very idea - ""Moms dating a guy who puts braces on kids teeth"" - conjure up your inner sixth-grader? (Wait till you see what the imprisoned Dybbuk has in store for him) You Might Also Like That atmosphere of faint but persistent gloom along with the underplayed performances of Morgan and Sedgwick a pair of genuine movie pros constitutes the true heart of the picture. (The photography most of it in blues and grays is by Dan Laustsen who also shot Bornedals delicious noir thriller ""Just Another Love Story."") Movies about demons usually have to choose between psychological and supernatural explanations but this one insists on both. The muttering entity in the box which first manifests itself as swarms of oversize moths is real enough in this movies universe - but it can only gain access to Ems mind and body because shes vulnerable and unhappy. If I really wanted to I could construct an argument that ""The Possession"" has a right-wing family-values agenda Dont get divorced or the Jewish boogeyman will get your kids Well maybe I buy into that agenda because my reaction to that is advice readers frequently offer me Chillax man Its just a movieGiven the understated mood of the picture Bornedal doesnt try to stage big gruesome shocker moments or for that matter fake shocks designed to make you jump. Theres minimal gore (although I gather the movie was cut down to garner a PG-13 rating) and the movies power comes from an inexorable grinding fear thats very much reality-based the terror that just as unseen forces ate away Clyde and Stephanies love for each other now something else is eating their daughter. ""I feel funny"" Em tells her father during a moment of clarity. ""I dont feel like me."" While ""The Possession"" is no blindingly original reinvention of horror formula or anything I found it an intensely creepy invocation of parental fears with a nifty climax staged in the hallways and basements of a hospital. Id have to agree with the sentiment that if youve seen one exorcism sequence in a horror movie youve pretty much seen them all. This one builds nicely toward two tripped-out final twists and features the immensely agreeable Matisyahu as Tzadok a street-wise Hasid who blends his dads Old World wisdom with a little NYC hip-hop attitude. As Tzadok explains to the thoroughly goyish Clyde with a certain relish he has an obligation to violate the Sabbath and get into Clydes car because a human life is at stake. Your obligation on the other hand is to catch ""The Possession"" this weekend with appropriately mixed expectations - and then not to buy the cool-looking box with Hebrew writing on it at the Labor Day garage sale.

"The Possession review New demon same old haunts | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Possession review New demon same old hauntsExorcism flick The Possession trades Catholic creed for Jewish in its tale of an invading demon dybbuk but its just faint-by-numbers.Matisyahu left with Natasha Calis adds novelty to The Possession but the storyline doesnt veer far enough.  (Diyah Pera / Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 30 2012The Possession (out of 4)Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan Kyra Sedgwick and Matisyahu. Directed by Ole Bornedal. 91 minutes. Opens Aug. 31 at major theatres. 14ABlandly titled The Possession coughs wheezes and hurls like a defective factory issue from McSpooky Inc. rather than Sam Raimis supposedly creative Ghost House Pictures.Allegedly based on a true story -- and arent they all? -- it brings just one relatively new twist to The Exorcist story it trades on. Instead of Roman Catholic creed the industry standard it uses Jewish folklore for its rote possession saga and a devilish beastie called a dybbuk rather than Ol Nick himself.Article Continued BelowIt just goes to show you how generic this story is that it can be swapped interchangeably between religions. But religion barely enters the picture until the midway point when Hasidic hip-hop and reggae artist Matisyahu adds some novelty with his unorthodox stab at an Orthodox exorcism.Before that its faint-by-numbers as 10-year-old Emily (Natasha Calis) falls prey to the unseen inhabitant of an antique wooden box she buys at a yard sale. Youd think germs alone might invoke parental intervention against such a purchase but daddy Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is too preoccupied both as a basketball coach and as a newly divorced single parent.Clyde and his frosty ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) a jewelry maker must have done all right financially before their split. Hes able to move into a sizeable detached home in a new suburb with loads of room for Emily her nasty older sister Hannah (Madison Davenport) and the dybbuk.The first half of the film is spent with the usual possession routine whereby the normally sweet Emily has to reach the equivalent of DEFCON 5 on the satanic scale before anybody really pays heed and takes action.Those hundreds of moths swirling around Emilys room and out of her mouth? Its not time for the Raid its time for the rabbi.Enter Tzadok (Matisyahu) a rabbis son who bravely steps in with his improvised brand of dybbuk wrangling when his father declares the situation hopeless. The movie actually gets moderately interesting by this point but director Ole Bornedal (Nightwatch) and screenwriters Juliet Snowden and Stiles White (Boogeyman Knowing) dont take it as far as it could go probably to preserve a lucrative American PG-13 rating (an earlier ""R"" cut was rejected).They might have taken inspiration by watching the prologue to A Serious Man by the Coen Bros. In a few scant minutes it introduces both a dybbuk and a real sense of menace in a film that isnt even intended as horror at least not in a conventional sense.The obvious bid for an unwarranted sequel at the end of The Possession suggest that Raimi once hailed for his vision is now content to just milk his cows and count his cash. Thats really scary not to mention a little sad.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Diyah Pera Associated Press The Possession review A no-horror tale 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Possession Horror. Starring Kyra Sedgwick Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Natasha Calis. Directed by Ole Bornedal. (PG-13. 91 minutes.) Judging by the volume of ""based on a true story"" exorcism dramas coming out of Hollywood the Centers for Disease Control must be covering up some impressive statistics for demonic possession. Among preteen and teen girls its probably more common now than mononucleosis. ""The Possession"" doesnt distinguish itself from the competition memorable only because the exorcist is an Orthodox Jew and the spirit has a thing for moth infestations. Thats one of the pitfalls of making a movie that is similar to 50 others before it. You cant make a routine teen party comedy anymore. And you have to find something new to say with your exorcism film. Our story begins at the worlds worst estate sale where a son sells his mothers things as she still clings to life inside the house. Well-behaved tween Em finds a locked box with strange Hebrew inscriptions and opens it like a total idiot. Shes quickly possessed which takes her parents an eternity to figure out. Havent they seen ""The Exorcist""? Or ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" or ""The Rite"" or ""The Last Exorcism"" or ... Within days shes stabbing her father with a fork talking to an old woman who lives in her stomach and throwing up moths. So many moths. ""The Possession"" will probably be forgotten by Tuesday but in Hollywoods animal rental industry the moth wrangler for this film shouldnt have to buy a beer for the rest of 2012. Director Ole Bornedal and producer Sam Raimi deserve credit for attempting to make an actual film. Bornedal invests so much time in the characters - Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick play the split parents of the girls - that there are times you will forget this is a horror movie. Its Kramer vs. Kramer vs. Lucifer. But the tone is strangely subdued even in life-or-death situations. ""The Possession"" offers a blend of horror styles - including a few out-of-place Japanese horror nods a la ""The Ring"" - with little cohesion. And theres a lethargic quality to the performances as if everyones moving a little slowly before their first cup of coffee in the morning. When the moths arrive and things get weird/sinister theres no sense of urgency or terror. The movie does improve when Hebrew reggae star Matisyahu shows up as the exorcist although the spirit removal scenes go by too fast. Looking at the prolonged and stubborn possession of Regan MacNeil in ""The Exorcist"" the evil spirit in ""The Possession"" should be embarrassed to call itself a demon. (If youre looking for a solid 21st century exorcism film try Daniel Stamms ""The Last Exorcism."" It does the found-footage thing but in a thoughtful and entertaining way.)

The Possession isnt one of them. More about The Possession >> The latest in an endless stream of Exorcist retreads churned out since William Friedkins 1973 masterpiece Bornedals dispiritingly unscary pic is a slick efficient piece of hokum about a 10-year-old girl; a gnarly demon with gnarled fingers who has grown way too fond of her; her perennially worried recently divorced parents; and a charming bon mots-dispensing Hasidic-scholar-and-part-time-exorcist. Hasidic? In a variation on a theme the existential smackdown in The Possession isnt Catholic-flavored but Jewish. And why not? All three Abrahamic faiths have some version of the ritual. And the last noteworthy film in the genre 2010s The Last Exorcism featured an evangelical Protestant. Sadly this is the only novel aspect of Bornedals dud. Set in upstate New York The Possession stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick as the divorced couple Clyde and Stephanie. Shes working hard to move on having added to her wardrobe a psychotically chipper passive-aggressive dentist named Brett (Grant Show) who dotes on her much in the manner of a poodle. Clyde a manboy college basketball coach is a melancholy fatalist forever stuck in the past. Morgan and Sedgwick are good together forever skirting each other in a tender if sad and awkward dance. They clash when it comes to their two daughters the whiny teenage rebel Hannah (Madison Davenport) and the eminently huggable Emily (Natasha Calis). Clyde spoils them leaving Stephanie to play the disciplinarian. The familys shattered life fragments further when Emily buys a wicked-looking (and wicked) antique wooden box covered in foreboding patterns and inscribed with Hebrew script. Inside the box Emily finds a bunch of small wooden boxes filled with creepy objects - an intact molar with long clawlike roots; a dead (or is it?) desiccated and mummified moth; tufts of human hair. Creepier still Emily finds these tokens of death and decay charming. Theres a whole moth subtext in the film which features numerous scenes of a stupefied Emily surrounded by preternatural moth activity. (But why moths? Why?) Its not long before Emily is taken over by a malevolent spirit called a dybbuk. She acquires a killer temper - and a murderous temperament. Enter the exorcist Tzadok who is played with delightfully hammy elan by Hasidic hip-hop and reggae rhymester Matisyahu. He chants and incants then chants some more incantations. The rest youve seen 100 times already. The Possession has none of the suspense that made Bornedals morgue thriller Deathwatch such shuddering good fun. And despite the absurdly overwrought Bernard Herrmann-esque score it has very few genuine shocks. Sure the film is well-crafted well-paced well-shot and well-acted. But its well so very bland.

"Possession has a twist but is it kosher? - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Possession has a twist but is it kosher? Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 08.30.12 | 408 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In ""The Possession"" another little girl from a broken middle-class home becomes a demons plaything. Mommy and daddy - Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan - just fell out of love and live in separate houses. Now little Emily (Natasha Calis) who once harbored hope that her parents would reconcile is crawling around on the kitchen floor exhaling computer-generated moths and making nasty faces. Oh my God evil. Whats with you? Ever since ""The Exorcist"" its been the same song-and-crab-dance Demons dont kill divorce does. The only twist on this old-fashioned focus-on-the-family nonsense - the only non-bodily twist (is possession the best chiropractor or what?) - is that the demon is Jewish. Yes at a yard sale Emily has her father buy her a big wood box engraved in Hebrew. The box moans and whispers and kicks up the sorts of winds that can whip schoolteachers and old ladies around a room. Its resident is a wayward spirit called a dybbuk and this particular dybbuk wants the body of an innocent kid. Obviously theres a panicked drive to Bensonhurst in the hope of finding the one Hassid willing to violate Shabbat drive upstate and perform a kosher exorcism. (Its the rapper Matisyahu) ""The Possession"" is morally lazy. Juliet Snowden and Stiles White are the credited screenwriters and there had to be a more subtle way to drive home the divorce-is-bad message than having Sedgwick say to Morgan ""You destroyed this family but I wont let you hurt the children"" But this is the sort of movie that needs a line like that to enhance the healing and remorse. A relationship that died of natural causes will live again courtesy of supernatural ones. Some people are touched by Roma Downey and Della Reese. Others? Theyre touched by dybbuks. Anyway Morgans haggard manliness is a selling point. Hes what Javier Bardem would look like if Bardem worked at a shipping-town dive bar. And Calis is a hoot. Yes the two actors share an extended regrettable double-entendre about the box thats sure to be mocked in ""Scary Movie 46"" but this girl gives evil her all. Her eyes roll more than mine did. When her face said ""Jump"" I asked ""How high?"" On one hand ""The Possession"" is just more demonic-possession junk. On the other theres some filmmaking in it. The director is Ole Bornedal a Dane with a good eye and nice way with framing be it in a long shot or a close-up. For at least half the movie theres rhythm. A creepy scene abruptly cuts to black; we hear the bang of a low piano note and see an aerial shot of a neighborhood. Its not Hitchcock or Polanski. Its not even William ""The Exorcist"" Friedkin. But when a director bothers to string together shots that last longer than seven or eight seconds when you feel him trying to create atmosphere and suspense within the camera frame (as opposed to piling on lots of noise and editing) when you can sense him enjoying how stupid his movie is youre thankful. His joy is yours even though most of the scares take a detour into comedy. The audience has seen it all before and were OK to laugh. Horror repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce.

The Possession ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) offers a more unusual hero an orthodox rabbi.By Diyah Pera LionsgateThe Possession starring Natasha Calis does little to distinguish itself from the exorcism films of yesteryear.EnlargeCloseBy Diyah Pera LionsgateThe Possession starring Natasha Calis does little to distinguish itself from the exorcism films of yesteryear.Sponsored LinksSadly its the only fresh element in this tired sub-genre of demon-child horror movies.Whether the perp is Satan a random devil or as in this case a dibbuk -- a malicious spirit in Jewish folklore -- demonic possession movies are cut from the same diabolically familiar cloth. A malevolent force captures the soul of an innocent child and sinister mayhem ensues.STORY The Possession wasnt childs playVIDEO Sedgwick and co-stars talk ""PossessionTen-year-old Emily (Natasha Calis) actually bears a mild resemblance to Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Fortunately the story lacks projectile vomit and since the demon derives from Judaic lore no crucifixes are involved.Dibbuks are believed to be the dislocated souls of dead people who inhabit a host and ultimately devour it. This spirit seems a bit confused on the devouring front. Why would strange ghostly fingers emerge from Emilys gullet and cause her to gag like a stuttering bulimic?The dibbuk is initially ""living"" in an antique box engraved with Hebrew letters that Emily spots at a yard sale and begs her dad to buy. Theres a cautionary tale here about getting children everything they ask for.About the movieThe Possession out of fourStarsJeffrey Dean Morgan Natasha Calis Kyra Sedgwick Madison Davenport MatisyahuDirector Ole BornedalDistributor Lionsgate Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material involving violence and disturbing sequences Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwideJeffrey Dean Morgan plays Clyde Emilys father a basketball coach who is recently divorced from her mom Stephanie played by Kyra Sedgwick. Their divorce is a convenient narrative device in that it encourages squabbling and blaming and delays the realization that Emily is possessed. Emilys older sister Hannah (Madison Davenport) is oddly unaware of her sisters increasingly terrifying behavior.The credits actually claim this is based on a true story. While no news reports surfaced of a suburban tween whose evil alter ego was implicated in the gruesome death of a teacher and so many other malevolent behaviors that it required a rabbinical exorcism there was a 2004 Los Angeles Times story about a cursed wooden cabinet. Rather than embellish imaginatively screenwriter Leslie Gornstein seems to have re-watched The Exorcist Poltergeist and The Unborn for inspiration.Enjoy two clips from The PossessionSwarms of large moths appear repeatedly and portend nothing good. The spirit causes little Emilys eyes to turn a milky white rimmed with dark circles. It later shows its murky face in an MRI read-out. Calis is good at switching in and out of possession mode and ably conveys the sense that she is a human battleground between the forces of good and evil. But director Ole Bornedal gives her far too much standard-issue spooky-eyed staring and screaming to do while under demonic influence.Seeing his daughters attachment to the wooden box Clyde does some online research that propels him to meet with several Hasidic rabbis. Fearful of inciting the spirit the Jewish elders offer no help. But a young rabbinical scholar (Hasidic reggae/hip-hop artist Matisyahu) comes coolly to the rescue.While the sound design and spooky minimalist music add suspense and CGI effects are duly sinister a climactic strobe effect is more annoying than frightening.From the depths of the box the evil occasionally pipes up in a creepy singsongy voice that appears to be bilingual -- English and whispery Hebrew. There is likely gibberish involved.Or was it rasping out Poltergeist Meets Exorcist backwards? For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Possession offers a steady stream of chuckles and a few big laughs. Unfortunately it isnt a comedy its an exorcism-themed horror film that fails to glean suspense out of scenarios that devolved into kitsch after The Exorcist inspired an avalanche of knock-offs that continue to this day. The Possession attempts to breathe new life into a creaky old subgenre by taking its exorcist and demon from Jewish mythology but even this backfires The casting of Jewish reggae star Matisyahu would be distracting even if he werent introduced singing softly to himself. Matisyahu is probably a better beatboxer than The Exorcists Max von Sydow but he lacks the older actors gravitas. (For better or worse The Possessions commitment to unintentional comedy stops just short of Matisyahu climactically challenging the central demon to a rap battle for a little girls soul.) Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as a basketball coach manfully coping with the dissolution of his marriage to Kyra Sedgwick and its effect on his children. Morgans already complicated existence grows even more difficult when one of his two young daughters (Natasha Calis) begins exhibiting violent disturbing behavior after coming into possession of a mysterious wooden box adorned with Hebrew writing. Morgans concerns bring him into the orbit of the devout Matisyahu who goes against the wishes of his rabbi father in an attempt to rid Calis of the demon possessing her soul. Whatever shock the incongruity of an angelic-looking child behaving in demonic ways might have possessed dissipated long ago from overuse in both Exorcist imitators and the endless stream of J-horror remakes rolled out over the last decade. The Possession is stingy in its images of Calis possessed by malevolent spirits but that seems to be less from a Jaws-like sense of economy and surprise than out of an understandable desire to hide its shame and cut its losses since they tend to register as comic rather than frightening. When The Possession closes with the obligatory tease of a potential sequel it feels like a host trying to foist leftovers on guests fleeing food they could barely stomach.

The Possession Fair Director Ole Bornedal. Cast Jeffrey Dean Morgan Natasha Calis Kyra Sedgwick. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material involving violence and disturbing sequences. Evil spirit takes over the body of an innocent victim yeah? Yeah. The trick is whether you can make it scary. (A good story is a plus also but if you get the scary part right enough that sometimes glosses over plot holes.) ""The Possession"" isnt exactly ""The Exorcist"" but Ole Bornedals film hits enough high notes to make it a worthwhile addition to the exorcism-film heap somewhere in the lower middle. Interview Jeffrey Dean Morgan Top 10 possession movies Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is a basketball coach at a small New York college. He is amicably separated in that just-in-movies way from wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) though he doesnt have much use for her Eddie-Haskell-like new beau (Grant Show). Their daughters Hannah (Madison Davenport) and Em (Natasha Calis) spend most of their time at Stephanies house and weekends at their dads new home. The separation is fresh enough that everyone involved is still learning how to live their lives in a different way. Clyde spoils the girls at least in Stephanies view. So its no surprise that when Clyde takes them to yard sales he lets them buy whatever they want. Em who hopes her parents will get back together (Clyde its evident also does) chooses an old wooden box which Clyde buys for her. As we have learned from a brief prologue theres something bad about the box something evil. Em quickly becomes obsessed with the box and just as quickly starts to feel strange. ""I dont feel like myself"" she tells Hannah and horror-movie veterans know that this is code for ""RED ALERT RED ALERT"" Alas even as Ems behavior grows more unusual violent even its all written off to her unsettled emotions over her parents separation. Thats a nice touch in the screenplay by Juliet Snowden and Stiles White Almost everything can be explained with logic and reason. Thats great news if youre a demon trying to possess someone but less good news for Em. What adds to the horror is Clydes well-founded fear of losing his girls. Hes already on notice for putting his job first and a move to a school in North Carolina is in the works. A few more events make things even trickier. Bornedal doesnt show much explicitly at least not for a while. Instead he sets the mood with creepy music; cold gray skies; and muted whispers. Its effective to a point. So too is the story and the acting. But only to a point. Morgan is such a likable presence a good ol guy kind of fellow that its easy to empathize with him as he struggles to figure out whats going on. Hes less good once he does figure it out. Then he and the story resort to by-the-numbers horror riffs playing a tune weve heard too many times before. (Calis is an exception. She is really good throughout. And Jewish rapper Matisyahu adds an interesting presence as an exorcist.) The film is based on a supposedly true story. Google it and you will be sufficiently creeped out. A little more so than you might be by the movie in fact. ""The Possession"" will scare you in the moment but unlike the best of these kinds of films it wont haunt you afterward.

Area theaters. Theres nothing especially ambitious about ""The Possession"" a generic exorcism thriller that the filmmakers -- including director Ole Bornedal and producer Sam Raimi -- insist is based in truth. But slick direction and a strong central turn from Jeffrey Dean Morgan will keep you watching if rarely from the edge of your seat. Morgan plays Clyde a college basketball coach recently divorced from his still-angry wife Stephanie (a subdued Kyra Sedgwick). We dont know exactly what happened between them though its clear she feels he never prioritized her or their daughters teenage Hannah (Madison Davenport) and preteen Em (Natasha Calis). The split has been tough on everyone but especially Clyde whos stuck in a depressing bachelor pad at the edge of town. When he brings the girls to see it theyre visibly unimpressed. But at least Em gets to spruce up her room with a cool box Clyde buys for her at a tag sale. Unfortunately this ancient artifact decorated with Hebrew writing comes with a surprise a dybbuk or evil spirit. Once Em opens it she becomes possessed by the demon leaving her parents initially confused and then terrified. Its not until Clyde brings the box to a Jewish scholar (musician Matisyahu) that they begin to realize what theyre up against. Writers Juliet Snowden and Stiles White make a few sharp observations about divorce and its effect on families. Mostly though theyre content to go through the usual horror paces placing far too much responsibility on the slim shoulders of young Calis. The charismatic Morgan does his best to relieve her burden investing his character with compelling confusion and fear. We dont for a moment believe that the flailing wild-eyed Em is really possessed. But at least Morgan convinces us that he does.

Supposedly based on a true story Ole Bornedals film finds malevolence in a hingeless Hebrew-inscribed box purchased by recent divorce Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) for younger daughter Em (Natasha Calis) at a tag sale. The trauma of parent separation on young children provides excellent cover for the boxs evil dybbuk spirit to get its hooks into Em whos soon scarfing down food for two and spying fingers trying to crawl out of her throat. Bornedals fondness for punctuating abrupt cuts to black with a solitary piano-key note is so pathological that it soon turns risible. Amid the usual scary-voiced eyes-rolling-into-heads mayhem as well as the semi-comic appearance of Hasidic rapper Matisyahu as a heroic rabbi the director does manage a few haunting images--Em encircled by a swarm of giant moths; the sight of the young girl arms outstretched while bathed in red light robotically pleading ""Daddy you scared me""--and an excellent Morgan exudes a shaggy protective-papa 70s-horror vibe. Ultimately however the films sole unique contribution to the genre is proving that unholy possession can be conclusively diagnosed via MRI.

TWITTER A young girl gets taken over by a dybbuk in this Judaic variation on the exorcism genre starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan Kyra Sedgwick and Hasidic hip hop star Matisyahu. Weve had zombies demons vampires and ghosts. Why shouldnt a dybbuk--the Judaic version of the possessing spirit--have a chance to finally shine again on the big screen? Representing a sort of equal opportunity religious variation on an all-too-familiar theme The Possession is a Jewish-themed Exorcist that if nothing else should discourage the practice of buying antique wooden boxes at flea markets. PHOTOS The 10 Least Scary Movies of All Time Such a box carved with Hebrew inscriptions causes no end of havoc in this low-rent horror film receiving a typical dog days end of summer release. It comes into the possession of the Brenek family or rather the splintered Brenek family since father Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has been separated from his ex-wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick) for a year causing predictable emotional difficulties for young daughters Hannah (Madison Davenport) and 10-year-old Em (Natasha Calis). Em persuades her dad to buy her the ominous looking box unaware that its previous owner an elderly woman has wound up immobilized in bed after being handled rather violently by the dybbuk inside it. Said dybbuk soon finds a new host in the innocent young girl who like Linda Blairs Regan starts displaying violent anti-social behavior. But while at first her symptoms prove hardly distinguishable from those of a typical troubled adolescent an invasion of giant moths in her bedroom prove the need for drastic measures or at least a good exterminator. PHOTOS Iconic Horror Movies After a quick consultation with a professor Clyde heads to Borough Park Brooklyn here depicted as so awash in Hasidim that it resembles a 19th century Polish shtetl. There he enlists the aid of a rabbis son Tzadok (played in a canny bit of casting by the Hasidic hip-hop/reggae star Matisyahu). After a medical procedure that reveals that dybukks are visible on MRIs they get down to the inevitable business of a Jewish exorcism performed in perhaps the most poorly securitized empty hospital in North America. Director Ole Bornedal (Nightwatch) indulges in the usual cheap scares induced by ear-shattering bursts of volume frequently punctuating scenes with blackouts and ominous piano chords. But despite young thespian Calis impressive ability for malevolent staring her character is never all that frightening with her possession often signaled by dark eye shadow that makes her look mainly like a young goth chick. PHOTOS Europes Horror Fetish The adult performers go through their properly anguished paces with professionalism with Morgan displaying his usual relaxed charisma and Sedgwick displaying even more levels of anger than she did as the hard-boiled deputy police chief in The Closer. But Matisyahu while a likeable screen presence seems to have been cast less for the quality of his acting than for his copious facial hair. Much is made of the fact that the film is ""based on a true story"" with the press notes even including an excerpt from the original ad on Ebay attempting to sell the infamous box. But there surely must be easier ways to drum up the price. Opens August 31 (Lionsgate). Production Ghost House Pictures.

Keep a close eye on what your children buy at yard sales suggests ""The Possession"" a ho-hum exorcism chiller that tries to spice up a formulaic screenplay by converting a predominantly Catholic-fixated horror subgenre to Judaism. Very loosely ""based on"" a 2004 Los Angeles Times article by journo Leslie Gornstein about the eBay auction of a ""dybbuk box"" this latest production from Sam Raimis Ghost House Pictures falls in line with the outfits most instantly forgettable PG-13 fright fare following the sturdy bow (and immediate collapse) of demonic possession thriller ""The Devil Inside"" earlier this year. For those unfamiliar with Jewish folklore -- and too impatient to wait for the films explanation which doesnt arrive until halfway through the running time -- a dybbuk is a spirit lingering in the land of the living often with the malicious intent of seeking a human host to latch onto. The unlucky victim in this case is preteen Em (Natasha Calis) younger daughter of a recently divorced couple in upstate New York workaholic basketball coach Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and worrisome jewelry designer Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick). Its Dad who allows Em to buy the suspicious box without realizing the danger lurking inside and first notices the symptoms of possession while Mom writes it off as adolescent angst brought on by parental separation. Things are bad enough when Em stabs Clydes hand with a fork during breakfast and lays a beatdown on a bratty classmate at school. Once she devours raw meat from the refrigerator and then enacts toothy torture on Stephanies well-meaning dentist boyfriend (Grant Show) it becomes evident to all that help is seriously needed. Enter Tzadok (Hasidic rap and reggae artist Matisyahu making his acting debut) the devout but eccentric son of a rabbi who offers aid and a spiritual solution when no one else will. Screenwriters Juliet Snowden and Stiles White (""Knowing"") and director Ole Bornedal (""Nightwatch"") save Tzadoks flashy exorcism setpiece for the films climax leaving the majority of the screen time to alternate between the tepid scares generated by Ems antics and the thinly sketched drama of Clyde and Stephanies broken marriage. The couples older daughter Hannah (Madison Davenport) spends half her time as a stereotypically sassy teen and the rest in hysterics over whats happening to her little sister. For Morgan and Sedgwick theres little either can do to invigorate characters designed strictly to serve the plot. In contrast with many possession films theres not even an attempt to explore the protagonists religious convictions or lack thereof. Theyre just understandably upset about their daughter. The showiest material falls to young Calis (a regular on the ill-fated TV adaptation of ""The Firm"") who delivers the films creepiest moments as Em smoothly switches back-and-forth from demonic force to a child frightened by whats inside her. Tech credits are fine by genre standards though special mention should be made of ""moth wrangler"" Brad MacDonald the man responsible for handling 2000 insects during a particularly skin-crawling sequence that starts with Hannah brushing her teeth. This also may be the rare horror film to boast a ""Judaic Consultant"" credit (Rabbi Shmuel Birnham has the honors for the record). ""The Possession"" was shot under the working title ""Dybbuk Box"" with a clear mission to expand that spirits pop-culture status (dybbuks previously factored into 2009s forgettable ""The Unborn"" and a more enduring Yiddish stage play ""The Dybbuk""). But the more generic final title better suits a wan effort with nothing genuinely new to offer. The PossessionProductionA Lionsgate release presented with Ghost House Pictures.
