A big-reveal thriller with surprises that really do surprise -- and are worth waiting for through an audaciously long buildup -- ""A Perfect Getaway"" finds writer-director David Twohy in popcorn form with a muscularity not seen since 2000s ""Pitch Black."" Toplining Milla Jovovich and Steve Zahn as one of three Kauai-vacationing couples imperiled by homicidal maniacs pic offers a basic ""Into the Blue""-type lure marrying suspense to spectacular scenery both natural and gym-toned. What develops however is gratifyingly twisty and doesnt lose its humor even when the going gets very tough. Late-summer sleeper status is assured with likely stronger ancillary biz. Excerpts from a wedding video intercut with the early Hawaii honeymoon days of Cydney (Jovovich) and Cliff (Zahn) accompanied by ominous music raise the usual expectations that well soon witness deep trouble in paradise. After viewing their destination by helicopter the two purchase permits allowing them to hike 11 miles to a remote beach. Their rental-car drive to the trails start point is marred by a brief encounter with hitchhikers Cleo (Chris Hemsworth) and Kale (Marley Shelton). She seems nice; he really doesnt. Once on foot our yuppie protags meet a more congenial fellow traveler in Nick (Timothy Olyphant) who leads them to a gorgeous waterfall where his own amour sassy Southerner Gina (Kiele Sanchez) is already taking the waters au naturel. The warning signs are many The more Nick and Gina talk the weirder they get. The stalking/skinning of a wild goat for supper induces Cliff to observe that his new friends have ""officially graduated to the crazy category."" This is no idle jest; by then everyone has become aware that a pair of honeymooners in Honolulu were brutally murdered by another couple who are still at large. It takes ""Getaway"" a full hour before it springs its biggest -- though far from last -- plot twist (which no doubt will be spoiled for many by text-messaging friends and unsubtly hinting reviewers). But that hour is far from time spent waiting for something to happen as Twohys screenplay gifts its principals with some fresh sparky dialogue. When things finally do go to hell in the proverbial handbasket the humor becomes more visceral than verbal though one female character does get a memorably offhand last line. The scripts sole dicey aspect is the characters occasional self-conscious quipping about the very thriller-movie tropes being upended (excused by the fact that Cliff is a rising screenwriter) but fortunately those arent pushed to overload. Twohys one directorial misstep is a late bit of split-screen gimmickry that values style over content. But those minor quibbles aside ""A Perfect Getaway"" is most satisfying (admittedly ""perfect"" would be a stretch) pop entertainment thats clever enough to require no apologies for being sexy gory and far-fetched when thought about afterward. Clearly enjoying their character idiosyncracies the thesps are sharp with slowly rising star Olyphant and comparative unknown Sanchez likely to get career boosts. Production is first-rate down the line; Mark Plummers widescreen images were mostly shot on Puerto Rico for tax-credit purposes with some Jamaica and Kauai pickups dressed in.

Set on the Hawaiian island of Kaui where a nine-mile trail winds through the jungle to an idyllic beach its kick-started by the news that a couple has killed some honeymooners. Were then introduced to nerdy newlywed screenwriter Cliff (Steve Zahn) and his wide-eyed wife Cydney (Milla Jovovich) who upset tattooed hitchhiker Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and his cowed wife Cleo (Marley Shelton) when they refuse them a lift. Also on the trail are yarn-spinning ex-soldier Nick (Timothy Oliphant) and his chatty Southern girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez) an outdoors gal capable of skinning a hunted goat. But an Cliff and Cydney trust them any more than the aggressive hitchhikers?And will they make it out alive? As suspicion falls on each couple in turn Twohy (Pitch Black) sustains the tension by constantly undermining our sense of certainty.

Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 06 2009 106PM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 28 2009 340AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English A Perfect Getaway Written and directed by David Twohy Starring Steve Zahn Timothy Olyphant Milla Jovovich and Kiele Sanchez Classification 14A Newlyweds Cliff and Cydney are excited to be in Hawaii. Hes a screenwriter without a credit. Shes a rich girl without a clue. And theyre looking for a honeymoon adventure to fuel an interesting marriage. To that end theyre going to backpack around one of Hawaiis most rugged islands climbing slippery cliffs and scooting doused in insect repellent through heavy jungle. But its not like theyre going native. Cliff still has his mobile phone which comes in handy when theyre followed by a menacing couple. This after Cliff learns another pair of honeymooners has been murdered on the island. It gets worse While trying to stay ahead of Strange Couple A Cliff and Cydney encounter Strange Couple B - Nick a special-ops nut who has just rotated out of Iraq and his southern-fried girlfriend Gina. Nick has a full-time Charles Manson gleam in his eye. And Gina fillets and fries a goat for supper happily yakking away the whole time. Every so often Cliff slips away to Google who the Hawaii-honeymoon killers might be. Authorities have a picture of the suspects. But his darned mobile phone cant summon enough juice to replicate the crucial photo. And so Cliff and Cydney and Strange Couples A and B chase each other around a suddenly dangerous tropical paradise - three fast moving parts in a deadly shell game. Which people are the killers? Which people are going to be killed? A Perfect Getaway is the rarest of film treats - a B-movie that knows where its going and how to get there. The film has all the requisites of the genre being a lightning-quick melodrama that is unafraid of appearing ridiculous however far writer-director David Twohy (screenwriter of The Fugitive ) takes his story out on a limb. A Perfect Getaway also benefits from one standout performance Timothy Olyphant ( Deadwood ) plays the part of Nick with ingratiating comic relish. Like Robert Ryan the great long-gone Hollywood actor who specialized in playing cheerfully troubled neurotics Olyphant seems to understand that low-budget action flicks are just the place for an actor to cut loose and have fun. The rest of the company is at least okay. Nerds nerd Steve Zahn is well cast as Cliff. And Milla Jovovich and Kiele Sanchez manage to bring some dramatic tension to the frightened-girlfriend moments. Another plus Filmmaker Twohy takes full advantage of his setting turning Hawaii into a gorgeously threatening landscape. In a sequence where Cydney missteps negotiating a narrow mossy mountain pass the audience experiences that sick-soaring feeling you get flying a kite too high in the air. A Perfect Getaway doesnt entirely live up to its title. Eventually a limb does snap and the film becomes too ridiculous in the last reel when were blindsided by a dandy plot twist that isnt unfortunately properly set up. Then again whats a B-movie without a groan or two?

Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich are a pair of newlyweds who learn of the murders while hiking a secluded trail. Suspicions begin forming about two other couples they encounter along the way -- intense hitchhikers Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton; and Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez Southerners who seem normal only by comparison. Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story but the slightly overlong ""A Perfect Getaway"" recovers with a pulse-pounding climax. Running time 98 minutes.

Joe Neumaier Thursday August 6 2009 429 PM Title A Perfect Getaway Thank goodness ""A Perfect Getaway"" builds to an acceptable twist. Otherwise this stalked-on-vacation thriller would be notable only for (a) a spookily unhinged turn by Timothy Olyphant who can make even run-of-the-mill unhinged watchable and (b) not starring irritating teenagers a fact that ought to earn it an extra star from the get-go.Not that there arent annoying characters viewers will want to see eliminated. In fact writer-director David Twohys conceit seems to be at first that his heroes have an unlikable averageness in contrast with every other couple in the film. The hook is that one twosome in the movie is made up of natural-born killers yet Twohy makes playing Find the Creeps fairly plodding until its time to shout ""Boo"" And then its logic that takes a vacation.Cliff and Cydney (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) are honeymooning in Hawaii just when two other newlyweds have been found butchered with security cameras catching grainy images of the guy and gal responsible. Cliff and Cyd are chatty and chipper. He makes sure people know hes a screenwriter not a ""screenplay writer."" Shes obsessed with correctly saying her full married name--unlike Kale and Cleo tattooed drifterfarians who uh-oh hitchhike and Nick and Gina (Olyphant and a kicky Kiele Sanchez) rough-and-tumble Southerners who eat goat.Other suspects crop up as the pair trek to a hidden spot on Oahu but its Nicks black-ops past and knife talent that sets off alarms. Cliff and Cydney are going to have to wise up or wind up on a spit.Twohy whose sci-fi hit ""Pitch Black"" elevated him out of scripting action flicks first uses the beautifully shot waterfalls and vistas of Hawaii to distract from some glaring plot holes and then turns to his actors as decoys. Most of the showoff duty falls to Olyphant (""Go"" ""Live Free or Die Hard"" ""Hitman"") who has just the right crazy-eyed good-ol-boy-gone-bad charm to counter Zahn and Jovovichs drippy dopiness. Zahn as in all his previous films fits that bill though the absence of the spunk that Jovovich showed in numerous sci-fi actioners seems odd. Could she really be this bad at playing normal?Shes not--not really--but ""A Perfect Getaway"" is also not that good at being cagey so Jovovich and Olyphant have to work doubly hard to keep things jumping. Which they do up to a point. The result isnt deadly dull but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

""A Perfect Getaway"" Movie Review -- ""A Perfect Getaway"" is one of those very clever whodunits that keeps you guessing for quite awhile. But on the way home as you replay its tricks you may feel more conned than charmed. The thriller stars Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich as Cliff and Cydney a couple hiking a remote Hawaiian trail. The only problem according to the other vacationers they meet is that a pair of serial killers is also in Hawaii picking off happy honeymooners. A Perfect Getaway (R) Rogue/Universal (98 min.) Directed by David Twohy. With Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich Timothy Olyphant Kiele Sanchez. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains gory violence brief nudity and strong language. Cliff is a talented new screenwriter at least according to him and the film plays with that a bit by embracing the mechanics of the well-crafted mystery script. (As one person says of the path theyre on ""There are a lot of twists and turns ahead."") So you want possible villains? Director David Twohy provides plenty to choose from. Could the murderers be those trashy hitchhikers Cliff and Cydney almost gave a lift to -- and who end up following them on the trail? Could they be the owners of that back-country supply store who stared real hard when Cliff pulled out his bankroll? Maybe. More probable are Nick and Gina (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez) a down-home couple who seem far too familiar with knives and crossbows and gutting animals and tend to stare off into space when no one is looking. So who are the real killers? Your guess is as good as mine. Well mine is probably a little better because Ive seen so many of these movies and I can never watch one without trying to solve it; its a compulsion like doing the daily crossword. And yes I figured this one out too although not as prematurely as I solved the recent ""Surveillance."" But after I did I felt as if Twohy hadnt quite played fair. I cant say how without giving the whole thing away but lets just say that instead of doing things to deceive the other characters the villains do some things to deceive the viewers. That said Twohy who also made the underrated ""The Arrival"" and the Vin Diesel-fueled ""Pitch Black"" has a feel for dialogue and some novel situations (although a slow and arty third-act flashback drags things down). Hes got a feel for good actors too. Zahn has been a consistently entertaining personality for awhile now whether its in oddball comedies or peculiar performances on ""The Tonight Show."" He brings a nice everyman quality to Cliff that wins our sympathies instantly. Jovovich is too perky and screechy as Cydney -- I wanted to chase her with a chainsaw myself after about five minutes -- but Sanchez is fine as the damaged Gina and Olyphant gives a hugely charismatic performance as Nick. I dont know why the 41-year-old Olyphant isnt already a movie star. Hes handsome and has a roguish charm (he looks a bit like Bill Paxton circa ""Twister""); he had a long run on HBOs ""Deadwood"" but hes never quite connected in films the way he could. Its unlikely that ""A Perfect Getaway"" will make a very large difference. For his part Zahn has a small and quirky following (and there are a few ""Resident Evil"" geeks who will watch Jovovich in anything) but thats not enough to break this film out of its sturdy genre niche. Which is fine. ""A Perfect Getaway"" provides some scares some gross-out moments and a corkscrew plot; you can see it in theaters now or catch it on DVD sometime next year and probably be moderately entertained either way. Just dont think too much about that final twist. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Media San Francisco Chronicle A Perfect Getaway Thriller. Starring Steve Zahn Timothy Olyphant Milla Jovovich and Kiele Sanchez. Directed by David Twohy. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Moviegoers who happened to see the big-budget mess ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" five years ago may have sworn off David Twohys films for life. The cut that played in theaters was just enough of a bloated over-caffeinated ""Dune""-like spectacle to make audiences forget all the nice touches that the writer-director had with dialogue and action in ""Pitch Black."" It says something that the two Riddick video games were infinitely better with the pixelated Vin Diesels performance in the video game somehow more engaging than the flesh and blood actor in the movie. ""A Perfect Getaway"" is a clever heart-pounding thriller and a welcome return to form for the director. It probably has a thousandth the visual effects budget of the ""Riddick"" movie lasting 97 minutes without a single explosion. But the acting is strong and the director sets a bold interesting pace - at times verging on collapsing the fourth wall between the actors and the audience. Its the type of B-movie throwaway thriller that studios program as secondary films during the summer blockbuster season but Twohy refuses to just go through the motions. Much of the credit goes to the actors starting with Cliff (Steve Zahn) as a screenwriter on a honeymoon with his less adventurous wife Cydney (Milla Jovovich). A male-female pair of serial killers is offing couples in Hawaii and Cliff and Cydney meet some prime candidates in the form of two grungy hitchhikers and a seemingly friendly couple that they run across on the trail. Even with a somewhat over-the-top final third of the film the weaknesses will occur to audiences only as they walk out of the theater. Although a second viewing may clarify some inconsistencies there are definitely a few actions by the principals that dont make sense once the spoilers are revealed. The dialogue is sharp and funny with most of the best lines going to Timothy Olyphant as Nick a hard-core survivalist type whose brain isnt wired like the rest of ours. Twohy also takes two classic moves from the Wes Craven playbook He uses Cliffs profession to make fun of the genre while also letting the audience know its OK not to take the movie too seriously. (A conversation involving the use of red herrings in movies is particularly spot-on considering this may be the red-herring-est movie of the year.) And when the bad guys are revealed and its time for some kill-or-be-killed action he allows his protagonists to do more than run and scream and trip over stuff. Before its over you might end up feeling a little sorry for the villains. -- Advisory This film contains strong language violence gore and scenes of nudity - most of which involve some kind of naked posterior/waterfall combination.

"The Perfect Getaway A perfect thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Perfect Getaway A perfect thrillerEver since Bruce Willis discovered he should be pushing up daisies at the end of The Sixth Sense  its as if every Hollywood thriller is required to have some cockamamie twist.n this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures from left Milla Jovovich Kiele Sanchez Timothy Olyphant and Steve Zahn are shown in a scene from ""A Perfect Getaway.""  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Aug. 7 2009Starring Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich and Timothy Olyphant. Directed by David Twohy. 96 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Ever since Bruce Willis discovered he should be pushing up daisies at the end of The Sixth Sense its as if every Hollywood thriller is required to have some cockamamie twist.More often than not this last-act revelation is so contrived that it undermines everything thats preceded it causing the movie to collapse into an unsightly heap. Article Continued BelowThat A Perfect Getaway comes with a surprise twist is itself no surprise - its even part of the hey-lets-give-the-ending-away marketing campaign. What is surprising about this effective little thriller is how cleverly writer-director David Twohy toys with the conventions of the genre as they exist today.And whereas so many movies stop dead in their tracks upon the arrival of that twist A Perfect Getaway actually picks up momentum. As the writer and/or director of such cult faves as Warlock The Arrival and Pitch Black Twohy already has a reputation for making movies that are more engaging than their lowly trappings would suggest.(Alas he couldnt save Waterworld with a rewrite but hes a screenwriter not a miracle worker.)Here he gets great mileage out of an unpromising premise about honeymooners whose Hawaiian holiday turns deadly. Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) are disturbed to hear that another pair of tourists has been murdered on a neighbouring island. Since a man and a woman are the prime suspects theyre understandably suspicious about two other couples they meet while hiking to a remote beach on the coast of Kauai. Their paranoia is fuelled by the sometimes strange behaviour of the two alpha males in question garrulous Iraq war vet Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and thuggish ex-con Kale (Chris Hemsworth).The fact that Cliff is a screenwriter allows for plenty of self-reflexive exchanges about how such stories are supposed to unfold. Nick thinks Nicolas Cage would be perfect to play him if Cliff ever turns this adventure into a movie. One conversation includes a reference to Natural Born Killers and when Nick warns of ""lots of twists and turns ahead"" you know hes not talking about the trail. Its also not the only time that A Perfect Getaway teeters on the edge of self-parody. Moreover some of Twohys methods of misdirection are less elegant than others. Problems that perennially face the makers of modern thrillers - like how not to call attention to soon-to-be-crucial information and what to do with characters pesky cellphones - occasionally stymie him too.But Twohy comes through with flying colours when the revelations that would have usually caused a last-act collapse instead yield a finale thats remarkable for both its breakneck speed and its Hitchcockian virtuosity.Even those viewers who saw the big surprise coming will feel impressed exhilarated and not a little grateful (in other words the opposite of what they felt at the end of every other movie by M. Night Shyamalan).Smart suspenseful yet aware of its own silliness A Perfect Getaway outwits and outpaces most of this summers more bloated offerings.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIEA Perfect Getaway  1/2 (out of four)Stars Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich Timothy Olyphant Kiele SanchezDirector David TwohyDistributor Rogue PicturesRating R for graphic violence language including sexual references and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Nothing spells honeymoon better than miles of gorgeous remote beaches -- and terror blood and guts. In A Perfect Getaway the path of true love takes a twisted turn when faced with the threat of psychopathic killers on the loose. This is bona-fide B-movie stuff that hinges on red herrings -- theres even a discussion of red snappers vs. red herrings. Even in this exotic setting Hollywood and screenwriting are topics of conversation. But beware of those who dont know their movie terminology. Once the surprise is out the film grows clumsier and more gruesome but it definitely has entertaining moments along the way. Three attractive couples figure into the mystery. Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) are on a Hawaiian honeymoon adventure. They decide to backpack to one of the most scenic and secluded spots in Kauai. En route they are stopped by a shaggy hitchhiking duo the blonde and multi-pierced Cleo (Marley Shelton) and her roughneck boyfriend Kale (Chris Hemsworth). Amid the waterfalls and lush foliage they meet a slightly more cleaned-up twosome the tough-talking Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and later his sunbathing Georgia transplant girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez). They hike the remote trails together in the shadow of reports of a grisly murder an island away. The scuttlebutt is that the killers are either on -- or headed to -- Kauai. The couples soldier on -- Nick actually is a former soldier -- which of course is what makes the experience silly fun for us viewers. If any of them sensibly turned back what fun would that be? Things get weird especially in the final third and theres a bit of off-kilter psychobabble thrown in to try to explain the inexplicable. But all that really matters is that the couples idyllic paradise is lost. A Perfect Getaway has its imperfections but for a thriller of its kind its a lively and slick summer escape.

In the tropical whodunit ""A Perfect Getaway"" Steve Zahn and Timothy Olyphant meet on an isolated Hawaiian hiking path. They play a screenwriter and a mysterious ex-commando and they dislike each other as instinctively as their chatty partners (Milla Jovovich and Kiele Sanchez) swap girl talk. The backpackers share a three-day trek to a hidden beach while eyeing each other suspiciously. You see the police are looking for a man and woman who killed a pair of newlyweds back in Honolulu. The film is a well-constructed mystery that teases the audience with repeated references to thriller movie cliches. The mild-mannered Zahn (solid in a rare dramatic role) and swaggering Olyphant generate a persuasive rivalry. Blinking anxiously behind his glasses Zahn draws his antagonist out cautiously feigning interest in writing a film about his adventures. For all the characters talk of second-act surprises and red herrings the observant will have no trouble seeing writer/director David Twoheys breadcrumb trail of hints. The End of the Line  out of four stars Unrated by the MPAA; disturbing images. Theater Lagoon. ""Shark Week"" notwithstanding the most efficient predator that the oceans have ever known is the industrial fishing industry whose nets have depleted some species to near collapse. ""The End of the Line"" is an aquatic companion to ""Silent Spring"" a warning that the seas are near a tipping point. Some marine populations ""are no longer renewable because of what we have done to them"" cautions London Daily Telegraph correspondent Charles Clover whose work inspired this fact-packed film. With commendable clarity it lays out the data. Newfoundland trawling fleets hunted the Atlantic cod to near-extinction in the early 1990s; the fish have not returned. The global take has been in significant decline for 20 years. Scientific studies meant to guide the European Unions fishing policies are disregarded because of political considerations. The upshot according to several experts the end of seafood by 2048 with delicacies such as bluefin tuna extinct much sooner. The film presents dissenting voices disputing some studies presented here. But even skeptics agree that its a case of ""how bad is it?"" As one marine biologist puts it ""Well soon be down to a highly simplified ecosystem of mud and worms."" Its not too late; the film extols Alaskas conservationist policies which control commercial fishing through time limits and quotas. Still a sea change in public understanding is needed.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + A Perfect Getaway may be a lousy title for a suspense thriller but once you see the film it does make a certain multi-leveled sense. In the same way the movie itself turns out to be a neatly crafted B-movie pleasure - nothing fancy but the gasps screams and (mostly) intentional laughs are there. Anyway ""The Honeymoon Killers was already taken.Its one of those city-mice-in-the-wilderness affairs with newly married yuppies Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) embarking on a Hawaiian hiking honeymoon on the isle of Kauai (cue dramatic helicopter shots of the jagged Na Pali Coast). Theyre in love and terminally naive forging ahead even after hearing about the brutal murder of two other newlyweds on Oahu - even after the chopper pilot calls the area ""the most gorgeous dead end God ever made. He stops just short of painting targets on their backs.Cliff and Cydney are savvy enough to avoid a creepy psycho-surfer couple they meet on the trail (Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton). On the other hand theyre clueless enough to tag along with Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez) who may or may not be the sweetest pair of homicidal killers on the island.Nicks handy with a bow and arrow and he regales Cliff with tales of his days in Iraq as part of an advance black-ops team. ""Im an American Jedi he crows and Olyphant whos delightfully confident here almost makes you believe the brag. Gina a lanky Southern belle can skin and dress a goat in minutes. ""I find it more interesting than gory really she remarks which isnt a bad description of the movie as a whole.Thats pretty much all you get Three couples strung out on a remote trail waiting for violence to erupt. Surprisingly its enough. ""A Perfect Getaway is proof that a dumb idea can be brought to life however briefly by smart people and writer-director David Twohy (""Pitch Black) is nothing if not clever. He makes Cliff a Hollywood screenwriter with a script lost in rewrite hell a fact that still impresses Nick whos sure his life would make a terrific Nicolas Cage project. ""Its all about story he barks at Gina. Exactly so; seen in retrospect some of the scenes could be writers exercises in how to mislead an audience.If its best to go in knowing as little as possible I can say the game board gets dramatically rearranged at a certain point after which the blood flows and dramatic believability is reduced to entertaining tatters. The actors - who are all quite a bit sharper than the people theyre playing - deliver their lines with nuances that in retrospect are entirely warranted.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet David Twohy is a veteran of Hollywood genre fare having tried his hand as screenwriter or writer-director on thrillers of all stripes--on land (The Fugitive G.I. Jane) by sea (Below Waterworld) and from outer space (Pitch Black The Chronicles Of Riddick The Arrival). He rarely does more than deliver on expectations but he knows the conventions of genre material enough to exploit them to clever effect. Twohys latest effort A Perfect Getaway is akin to a magician doing a trick with all the cards face up asking the audience to trust what they see while he pulls one over on them anyway. Even if you know whats coming its a neat bit of meta-thriller filmmaking as much about the mechanics of storytelling as a reasonably satisfying example of it. Taking a break from his space cadet typecasting Steve Zahn stars as a neophyte Hollywood screenwriter enjoying a honeymoon with wife Milla Jovovich in a lush tucked-away Eden in Kauai Hawaii. Before setting off on a 12-mile hike to the beach Zahn and Jovovich are unsettled by news about a series of murders in Honolulu apparently committed by a couple still at large. Along the way they encounter two couples who raise their suspicions. Behind Door 1 A pair of hitchhikers played by Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth the latter a tatted-up bully with a foul temper. Behind Door 2 Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez a more charismatic and likable pair that know very well--perhaps too well--how to survive in the isolation of unspoiled nature. The whodunit aspect of A Perfect Getaway isnt that strenuous a challenge no matter how often Twohy exploits his heros profession for commentary on the rules of the game. (When Olyphant insists that the term for a false avenue in a story is a ""red snapper"" hes trying to cast himself in that role.) But Twohy executes his diverting forgettable paperback thriller with a modicum of cleverness and style and the Kauai locations add to the mood of breezy escapism. Once the big twist is finally revealed the film falls back on by-the-numbers action mayhem but Twohy knows thats part of the thriller game too and hes happy to let A Perfect Getaway go down winking.

And up to a point it works. CAST Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich Timothy Olyphant Kiele Sanchez LENGTH 138 You know how these things go or at least you think you do Nebbishy screenwriter Cliff (Steve Zahn) and his hottie bride Cydney (Milla Jovovich) take a honeymoon in Hawaii where some gruesome murders have just made headlines. Nevertheless the citified newlyweds stop for a pair of rough-edged hitchhikers who seem friendly enough - at first. But ""A Perfect Getaway"" is smarter than it looks and more fun than it has a right to be. Writer-director David Twohy whose credits range from ""The Fugitive"" to ""Warlock"" trains his sights on jaded moviegoers who know all the tricks then takes advantage of our boredom to blindside us. If you think the premise is cliched the acting awful and the dialogue ridiculous youre correct - but youve also just fallen into Twohys trap. advertisement | advertise on newsday The film signals its self-awareness when Cliff and Cydney encounter yet another young couple a blustery alpha-male named Nick (Timothy Olyphant stealing the show) and his sultry survivalist girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez). Within minutes the talk turns to movies - ""Natural Born Killers"" comes up - and the men begin subtly needling each other using script-jargon like ""Act II twist."" The eventual stabbings shootings and maimings are to be expected. But Twohy also includes some stylistic flourishes (triple split-screens for starters) and out of nowhere a monologue that borders on Cartesian philosophy - all of which should throw you thoroughly off your game. MoviesTrailer A Perfect Getaway ""A Perfect Getaway"" ultimately gets too clever for its own good; youll likely walk away with more questions than answers. But score another point for Twohy At least he got you thinking. advertisement | advertise on newsday gt;gt;  Showtimes and tickets Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Perfect Getaway A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; perfect-getaway-a ) Perfect Getaway A (United States 2009) August 05 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are times when a filmmaker tries so hard to surprise everyone that he ends up surprising no one. Such is the case with A Perfect Getaway a film that exists for one reason the twist. Writer/director David Twohy (Pitch Black) puts so much effort into obfuscating the truth that he inadvertently reveals it. And when one looks beyond A Perfect Getaways surprise theres not much else - just a run-of-the-mill slasher/thriller with killers stalking victims in the untamed wilds of Hawaii. One assumes the 50th States Bureau of Tourism will not be promoting this motion picture. Although I will not explicitly reveal the nature of the twist in this review it will be possible for some readers to infer it based on how I describe things. (Consider this a warning.) For anyone who understand the ""rules"" of screenwriting such as the concept of ""conservation of character"" the turn that A Perfect Getaway takes 2/3 of the way through its proceedings is easily guessed. In fact the simple knowledge that there is a ""twist"" defuses the surprise quality of the revelation. Strangely Twohy trumpets the existence of such a twist early in the movie there is a conversation about screenwriting in which it is stated that ""good stories"" always have second-act twists. Scream was able to get away with this sort of wink-wink-nudge-nudge tactic when it came to ""horror film rules"" (as defined beginning with Halloween) but the approach here is less organic. Its a case of the screenwriter talking directly to the audience and informing viewers something unexpected is going to happen so they can start puzzling out what it will be. Unfortunately the options are so limited that it doesnt take more than a middling intuition to figure it out. A Perfect Getaway introduces us to three couples all of whom are vacationing in Hawaii. They share a common destination a picturesque beach that is reachable only by a long winding trail that twists and turns through lonely stretches of wilderness. Aside from the trail the only other way to get there is by kayak or helicopter. Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) are newlyweds visiting the islands on their honeymoon. Nick (Timonthy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez) are unmarried adventurers looking for one more destination to add to their globe-trotting resume. And Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and Cleo (Marley Shelton) are surfer/hippie types who show signs of anti-social behavior. All three couples are on the trail when the news filters down the bloody bodies of two recently murdered newlyweds honeymooning in Hawaii have been found. Understandably Cliff and Cydney are freaked out and Cliff begins to suspect Nick amp; Gina and Kale amp; Cleo of complicity in the crimes. Certainly Nicks Special Ops background and proficiency with weapons make him a suspect and Kales unpleasant disposition and volcanic temper merit his consideration. A Perfect Getaway is about perspective. It hides key clues and details from viewers until after the surprise is revealed then transitions to a more neutral narrative point-of-view. Although this is not strictly the case of an ""unreliable narrator"" (as in a film like He Loves Me He Loves Me Not) it is a case in which the director intentionally misleads the audience. The script mentions the concept of the ""red herring"" and sure enough it comes into play. Although some might consider Twohys inclusion of screenwriting 101 concepts to be playful this is actually an occasion when the filmmaker is being too clever for his own good. Once the ""reveal"" occurs Twohy feels the need to spend about ten minutes flashing back to previous events so we can see how they actually transpired now that theres no longer nay need to keep the audience in the dark. When a ""secret"" requires this much exposition it isnt as effective as is intended. This lengthy sequence indicates that either Twohy doesnt trust the intelligence of his audience (that they could piece everything together without prompting) or doesnt trust the integrity of his screenplay. The reality is probably somewhere in between. The cast members do what they were hired to do. Steve Zahn plays the ""nice guy"" - a nerdy bookish man who is made uncomfortable by spontaneity. Milla Jovovich is his equally geeky but somewhat more adventurous mate. Timothy Olyphant is off-the-wall in a way thats half-dangerous/half-sexy. Kiele Sanchez gives off a similar vibe although her first appearance is more revealing than Olyphants. Marley Shelton is ditsy and Chris Hemsworth shows a misanthropic streak. Of course by the end of the film none of the characters resemble what they appear to be at the beginning. The transformations are at least handled logically. By placing all of his proverbial eggs in one basket Twohy ensures that a viewers enjoyment is intimately tied into how he/she reacts to the twist. Those few who are surprised may think the movie takes some daring chances and ventures into unconventional territory. Those who figure it out early may wonder how a film with such a thin premise made it into production. The scenery is gorgeous but thats hardly a reason to make a movie. All the greenery doesnt enliven the tired clichA(c) of a knife and gun-wielding psycho chasing a potential victim and thats what A Perfect Getaway amounts to when reduced to its essence. Theres a late-game opportunity for Twohy to do something truly surprising but perhaps because he wants there to be a ray of sunshine he doesnt opt to venture completely into the Twilight Zone. That final capitulation robs A Perfect Getaway of any uniqueness it might have otherwise possessed. This could have been a triumph of structure over story if only the importance of the structure had been better camouflaged.

Everyones a suspect and no ones a suspect and writer-director David Twohys raison detre with this thriller -- aside from jolting us of course -- is to mess with our brains and keep us guessing until he reveals his Big Twist. Its not as earth-shattering as ""Bruce Willis is actually dead"" but its a pretty good one and itll make you go back and think twice about what the characters did and said to make sure it all makes sense. It does but its also a gimmick and a self-conscious one at that. One of the travelers on this supposedly perfect island vacation keeps talking about screenwriting devices like red herrings (though he mistakenly calls them red snappers) and second-act twists. This is not nearly as cute as Twohy (""Pitch Black"" ""The Chronicles of Riddick"") seems to think. But you could just ignore all that though and give into the many B-movie conventions ""A Perfect Getaway"" has to offer skeevy hitchhikers and strangers in the jungle skinny dipping and girl-on-girl fistfights. Its ridiculous but fun. Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich co-star as blissful newlyweds Cliff and Cydney a namby-pamby screenwriter and his overeager bride who spend their honeymoon backpacking to a remote beach in Hawaii. Along the way they run into two other couples Nick and Gina (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez) who seem friendly enough if a bit trashy and brazen and Kale and Cleo (Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton) who try to bum a ride in Cliff and Cydneys Jeep but seem way too obviously unhinged. All their paths repeatedly cross along scenic treacherous hiking trails with increasing tension. Adding to the danger A young couple savagely killed some newlyweds in Honolulu recently and now theyre on the loose. Advertise Advertise Advertise And so its up to us to figure out who the killers might be with Twohy yanking us in one direction or another. One character is carrying a parole officers business card in a backpack with the date of an upcoming appointment for example; another is inordinately skilled at gutting and grilling a freshly slaughtered goat. Again all silly goosey fun. But while ""A Perfect Getaway"" has its moments of suspense its never truly frightening even once the big reveal takes place and the bodies start stacking up. After toying with us Twohys reliance on standard shootings and stabbings is really rather boring. Olyphant and Sanchez have an appealing chemistry with each other though and add just the right amount of weirdness. Hes an ex-military man with tall tales of fighting in Iraq shes a twangy and slightly dangerous Southern girl who says lovingly of her man ""Yeah hes really hard to kill."" Gee what could that possibly mean? (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

Since there are three couples on that trail the trick to this not-as-tricky-as-youd-hope mystery is figuring out which couples are potential victims and which are murderers.It has only one conventionally tricky way the mystery can resolve itself. That doesnt mean the finale of this David Twohy (Pitch Black) film isnt a lulu. Cliff and Cydney ( Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) are newlyweds spending their honeymoon trekking on Kauai. Hes fresh out of film school a ""screenplay writer"" she crows.""Actually were called screenwriters"" he corrects. The people they meet arent exactly charming company. Theres the rough-hewn Kale and Cleo (Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton) scary hitchhikers who take an instant dislike to them. Trail-mates Nick and Gina (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez) are chatty free spirits. But Nicks got a million stories about his violent ""Special Forces"" past tips for Cliffs scripts ""second-act surprise"" or ""red snapper.""""Red herring"" Cliff corrects.""Youre a screenwriter Im a Jedi"" Nick cracks back.Olyphant (Hitman) is making a nice career for himself out of his spooky eyes and bad-guy vibe. He has lots of fun with Nick all swagger and bluff a regular Man vs. Wild. ""He is really hard to kill"" drawls Gina at a death-defying tale from Nick.But out there in the Hawaiian boondocks word creeps in about murders in Honolulu and Cliff and Cydney start to panic.Jovovich who has morphed from skinny model into the resident butt-kicker of the Resident Evil movies gives Cydney girlish touches playing naive to the hilt.Its too bad Twohy relied on that student screenwriters crutch -- a screenwriter character in a movie about thriller cliches -- and typed himself into a corner. The exotic setting and characters deserve more riveting situations than this imperfect Getaway gives them.A Perfect GetawayThree of five starsCast Milla Jovovich Steve Zahn Timothy Olyphant Kiele SanchezDirector David TwohyRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesIndustry rating R graphic violence language including sexual references and some drug use.

A Perfect Getaway Fair Director David Twohy. Cast Steve Zahn Milla Jovovich Timothy Olyphant Kiele Sanchez Marley Shelton Chris Hemsworth. Rating R for graphic violence language drug use and nudity. Related Models in the movies Granted its not like the movie sets the bar extremely high but hey theres something to be said for aiming for the middle. The film focuses on screenwriter Cliff (Steve Zahn who can liven up any script) and his bride Cydney (Milla Jovovich who cant). The two are honeymooning in Hawaii when news breaks that a man and woman have just killed another newlywed couple. Suspects abound. There is a pair of sleazebags (Marley Shelton and Chris Hemsworth) our heroes meet while hitchhiking. Then comes stoned Gina (Kiele Sanchez) and her boyfriend a dim-bulb named Nick (Timothy Olyphant). He has a way with a knife and a Nicolas Cage fixation. Writer and director David Twohy puts the characters together in a gorgeous isolated area of Kauai. Then he slowly tightens the films grip on viewers before all hell breaks lose. Things get really wild with some startling violence and a nifty third-act twist that is completely out of blue yet thoroughly satisfactory. Twohy - he also created the excellent 2002 spooker ""Below"" - keeps viewers guessing throughout. He also fills the flick with some self-aware dialogue about suspense films; in one sequence Nick and Cliff argue about whether the proper term is ""red herring"" or ""red snapper."" It is a witty bit and offers a bit of foreshadowing Red herrings abound here and it is all part of the fun. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.om or 602-444-8849.

Half of the movie seems fresh and hair-raising. The rest is just disappointing and predictable. At least it provides the underrated Steve Zahn a likable and inventive actor with natural talent with a starring role. He makes every minute count. When newlyweds Cliff and Cydney Anderson (Mr. Zahn and Milla Jovovich) arrive on the lush island of Kauai for an adventurous Hawaiian honeymoon their timing coincides with the headline-making news that a pair of serial killers are on the loose brutally hacking up the tourists. Cliff a nearsighted screenwriter with nerdy spectacles and few outdoor skills is no Indiana Jones but hes promised his wife an 11-mile hike up the Kalalau Trail to a spectacular beach with a hidden waterfall so against all odds and the creepy feeling theyre being stalked its a-hiking they go. The farther they get from the overcrowded part of the map and the deeper they plunge into the jungle the stranger they feel. On the trail they bond with another couple--Nick (Timothy Olyphant) a rugged hunter with ripped abs and a metal plate in his head from combat duty in Iraq and his perky girlfriend Gina (Kiele Sanchez) who has a thick Southern drawl and special skills with a machete. Cliff and Cydney feel safer with their new friends in tow. Nick is a warrior type who can survive the wilderness building shelter and catching his own food with a bow and arrow and Gina is a whiz at gutting animals for food. Then a third couple encroaches--a pair of hostile tattooed and potentially dangerous hippies who give Cliff the willies. Just when things get hairy they are arrested and taken away by police helicopters. Case closed. Or is it? Suddenly the movie shifts gears tables turn and roles reverse plunging everyone into a fatal series of screaming terrors replete with red herrings character reversals screenplay twists and a violent blood-drenched finale guaranteed to sizzle your nerves. The whole thing leads to the unraveling of the identity of the psychopathic maniacs and if youre unhinged by the big surprise well then. You havent seen as many contrived chillers as the rest of us. Nothing in the script by David Twohy who also directed is very suspenseful. The real scares come from watching the actors change skins like snakes. The women are comely enough but the stars are the two fellows who know how to seize attention and hold it with raw fury. Timothy Olyphants Nick is one of those sculptured all-American too-perfect-to-be-real hunks who could win a college football trophy or manage your stocks on Wall Street merely by a simple change of wardrobe--but with a dangerous edge. Cliff is the one who claims to write films but Nick is the one who knows all the plots and drops all the names. His expressions alone fill A Perfect Getaway with surprises that are not in the script. And Steve Zahns Cliff keeps his balls in the air and out of sight until you dont know what to think. He keeps you guessing. The films failure to supply logic in its characters when they start switching lanes is a big weakness but I especially liked the great picture-postcard cinematography of Hawaii that contrasts savagery with sunshine and keeps you sighing while it hides the darker side of paradise. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under A Perfect Getaway Kiele Sanchez Milla Jovovich movie On the Town Steve Zahn Timothy Olyphant Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2009/movies/tourist-trap,200,aperfectgetaway25,aperfectgetaway,observer

The couple in question--nerdy screenwriter Cliff (Steve Zahn) and wife Cydney (Milla Jovovich)--have just arrived in Kauai Hawaii for their honeymoon when they hear about a recent murder of newlyweds on the secluded island. Suspecting a white-trash couple (Chris Hemsworth and Marley Shelton) they befriend another pair of lovebirds (Timothy Olyphant and Kiele Sanchez) who seem nice enough despite some ominous signals that they too could have homicidal tendencies. Twohy knows that his films raison detre is to lay out ridiculous red herrings while keeping us guessing as to whos targeting our heroes but he finds inventive ways to mess with expectations whether its by supplying a bizarre backstory monologue or dishing dark humor at the unlikeliest of occasions. Rest assured though the storys Big Twist is reliably out-there culminating in a no-holds-barred battle to the death thats craftier and more muscular than the norm. A Perfect Getaway is never great but Twohy isnt aspiring for greatness--hes after gritty and lively and weird. And thats good enough.
