Photo Credit Marvel Studios advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Norse god banished to Earth must find his way back home. BOTTOM LINE Hemsworth has charisma along with those abs but the film is a loud confusing mess. CAST Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins WHEN/WHERE Area theaters in IMAX and 3-D LENGTH 153 You can see why Kenneth Branagh one of the great popularizers of Shakespeare agreed to direct the superhero movie ""Thor."" Aside from the money what probably attracted him were the familiar themes themselves borrowed from ancient Norse mythology a king a son the desire for a throne. Thats where the similarities between the Bards plays and this Marvel comics adaptation end. Branagh struggles mightily to find the emotional center of ""Thor"" but is too bogged down by a Hollywood superhero format that requires each new installment to lay groundwork for the next (in this case next years ""The Avengers""). For every minute spent pleasing fans with little hints and cameos ""Thor"" misses another chance to tell an actual you know story. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Chris Hemsworth makes for a likable Thor even though the thunder-gods vanity and disobedience provoke his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) into banishing him from Asgard. Thor lands in -- where else? -- small-town New Mexico giving astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) a chance to observe his heavenly body. As Thor tries to redeem himself his deceptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) lays his own plans. Bouncing frantically between planets kingdoms and eons ""Thor"" cant even find time to have fun with its fish-out-of-water hero. The occasional glimmers of humanity and humor (as when Thor storms into a pet store and calls for a horse) are quickly obliterated by the next computer-generated battle sequence. Lets hope Branagh was well-compensated at least. To quote his favorite author No profit grows where is no pleasure taken. VideoTrailer Thor advertisement | advertise on newsday Back story Director Branagh the perfect guy Its not surprising to see art-house souls migrate to superhero films -- ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" director Michel Gondry took a ride with ""The Green Hornet""; Christopher Nolan made his mark with ""Memento"" long before Gotham City. But Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was taken aback a few years ago when Kenneth Branaghs camp inquired about ""Thor."" Feige whose passions run more toward ""Star Trek"" than ""Masterpiece Theatre"" was intrigued having seen Branaghs vibrant 1993 ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and been stunned by how much he enjoyed it. ""The accessibility of it"" Feige said ""that makes him the perfect guy to take Thor to the screen."" When Branagh was growing up first in Belfast Northern Ireland and then in England American superheroes were a mystery with the exception of the blond-tressed thunder god with winged hat and a red cape.  ""I was passionate about Thor"" Branagh 50 said. ""There was so much there this hero with primitive brute strength and the dysfunctional family and always this sense of epic about it the journeys and quests and vendettas.""

"Review Thor blows hot and cold - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Thor blows hot and cold By Tom Charity Special to CNN Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman find each other in the new movie ""Thor."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSThor the Norse god of thunder gets an updated lookNewcomer Chris Hemsworth plays Thor; Natalie Portman is his love interestShakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh directs the film (CNN) -- The Norse god of thunder makes his big-screen debut in the latest Marvel movie the first of three heading our way this summer. Portents are good for future developments but director Kenneth Branagh makes heavy weather of the back story. If youre not up on your Viking mythology Thor is the guy with the hammer and the tempestuous temper. In Stan Lees resurrection his father Odin punished Thors recklessness by condemning him to a double life as Dr. Donald Blake a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind. The movie gives us a brand new deity who is also a bit of both. The story teeter-totters between the exiled Thor crash-landing in New Mexico -- where hes immediately run over by Natalie Portmans storm-chasing astrophysicist Jane -- and Asgard where he vies with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to vanquish the Ice Giants (not a hockey team) and win the respect of their father (Anthony Hopkins gamely trying to inject some Lear-like gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets). Chris Hemsworth is Thor RELATED TOPICS Movie Reviews Entertainment Celebrity News An unholy combination of a Vegas penthouse and Disney palazzo Asgard is a computer-generated Valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing Hubblesque views of the cosmos. A vast waterfall drains out into space and an electric highway allows the gods to drop in on any of the nine realms one of which is Earth. The stereoscopic scenery is impressive but the screenwriters have a tin ear for god-speak settling for something between Shakespeare and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Presumably this is why Marvel turned the reins over to Ken Branagh whose credentials include ""Hamlet"" ""Henry V"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing."" Branagh has a penchant for back-slapping bluster and bravado as well as the kind of kinky camera-angles that make you wonder if someones tripod has lost a leg -- which pretty well describes the movies exhaustingly lop-sided first act. ""Thor"" is on much safer ground here on Earth. The tone is immediately different more relaxed; comic not cosmic as Jane and her colleagues (a wisecracking Kat Dennings and mistrustful Stellan Skarsgard) figure out whether the blond muscle man who fell to Earth is a lunatic or a miracle. In this incarnation Thor has lost his power tool -- the hammer affectionately known as Mjolnir -- but he has kept his wits about him and takes his new circumstances in his stride. iReport ""Natalie Portman should give her Oscar back"" Beefy Australian newcomer Chris Hemsworth seems to be channeling the young Branagh in his portrait of an impetuous gallant alpha male burning to be king. Theres no finesse in the performance but broad strokes are all it takes; the other actors just bounce off him and the movie finds its sense of fun. But it never settles for long. All the substantial plotting takes place on the astral plane in Asgard. The New Mexico episodes feel like a sideshow. iReport Fans rave for ""Thor"" In essence another plank in the elaborate foundation work for the forthcoming ""Avengers"" movie what ""Thor"" sorely lacks is a center of gravity. On the other hand it is as spectacular as 150 million can buy and very much at the milder end of the PG-13 spectrum. It should hook legions of kids who can look forward to years more Thor -- probably bigger and better -- in the future.

By David Edelstein Published May 8 2011 ShareThis Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace in Everything Must Go.  (Photo John Estes/Courtesy of Roadside Attractions) A teacher of mine named Leo Rockas had a brilliant way of characterizing Chekhov The author he said began by writing conventional narratives with twist endings and then over time lopped off the beginnings and twists leaving only the suggestive essencethe model for the modern short story. Raymond Carvers Why Dont You Dance? is Chekhovian in that way. A middle-aged husband is cast out forced to move his belongings and furniture (including his comfy easy chair) to his lawn where he sits getting blottountil a young couple invades his new world mistaking it for a yard sale. You could give the story to five filmmakers and get five unalike features. Dan Rushs is called Everything Must Go and is perhaps inevitably a dilution. Its also missing Carvers stunning climax the drunken dance between the middle-aged man and the young wife. But the movie is very fine. That lawn with its scraps of a ruined life is a setting both satirical and poignant and Will Ferrell gives a performance of Chekhovian depth. See AlsoEdelstein on the Trippy Tacky Monumental Thor Id say Ferrells work is a revelation except it isnt. Even in slapstick comedies like Step Brothers he shows a delicate touch his child-men holding onto a defensive arrogance that barely conceals their helplessness. As Nick Halsey in Everything Must Go he goes to the far side of that arrogance. Having lost his sales job and home Nick has no more illusions to which to clingonly booze and an easy chair neither of which can hold off reality for long. Yet a glimmer in his eyes suggests he recognizes the splendid absurdity of a yard sale which represents both hopelessness (giving up his old life) and hope (giving up his old life). Rush can be gentle to the point of non-intervention yet he finds a balance between nihilism and faith that should be the envy of more experienced filmmakers. A subplot involving a chubby kid (Christopher Jordan WallaceBiggie Smallss son) whom Nick teaches the art of salesmanship is expertly undersold Rebecca Hall gives Nicks pregnant new neighbor layers of neediness and nervousness and Laura Dern is unspeakably moving as a high-school classmate whom Nick seeks out after rereading a note in his yearbook. The end is wide open neither sentimental nor bitter perhaps less Carverian than Chekhovian but perhaps too the better for it. Everything Must Go Directed by Dan Rush. Roadside Attractions. R.

Thor the second-tier Marvel Comics hero arrives onscreen in the strapping form of Australian soap opera star Chris Hemsworth who seems to be having much more fun here than the better-known stars lining up at the money teat (Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins Stellan Skarsgard Kat Dennings Idris Elba Rene Russo). As a Norse warrior magically transported into the 21st century Hemsworth also gets the best lines at one point Thor swaggers into a pet store and bellows ""I need a horse"" This is eminently missable though the mosaic design of Asgard Thors mythical realm is pretty cool.

May 6 2011 Save for later Saved Chris Hemsworth does some dimension-shifting in the title role of the flashy film adaptation of Marvel Comics The Mighty Thor. Paramount Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I held out some hope for ""Thor"" because it was directed by Kenneth Branagh and costars Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. It also kicks off a new franchise and debut franchise flicks are usually a lot better than their sequels.Not being an aficionado of the Marvel Comics hero Thor not to mention Norse mythology I approached this new lollapalooza with an open mind that was quickly addled by loads of back story and front story and an ear-splitting avalanche of special effects - in IMAX 3-D no less just in case bodies and hammers hurtling straight at you in 2-D seems hopelessly passe.""Thor"" begins in the New Mexico desert - ground zero for all things extraterrestrially spooky. Astrophysicist Jane Foster (Portman) her mentor Dr. Erik Sevig (Stellan Skarsgard) and sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings) are investigating an atmospheric disturbance when a big bearded stranger - that would be Thor played by hunky Australian soap star Chris Hemsworth - knocks into their RV. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? From here the film which was written by Ashley Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne flashes back and forth between Earth and the floating kingdom of Asgard where Thors white-bearded father Odin (Hopkins) has had his hands full. In the run-up to Odins coronation of Thor as his successor the Frost Giants of Jotunheim perpetual foes who seem to have cornered the market on pointy chins crash the party. This sends Thor into a tantrum of retribution so unseemly that Odin ends up stripping him of his powers and banishing him to Earth leaving his slit-eyed half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to ply his own hubris. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Branagh seems to have confused the sequences involving Odin and Thor with Shakespeare at his most doomy. In most other respects this 150 million epic is monumentally cheesy. The special effects in the Asgard scenes are scaled big and the Earth scenes by deliberate contrast are rather plain. As a result I felt continually wrenched not only between two worlds but also between two very different kinds of headaches.In a film like this talented actors are often caught in a bind. Do I try to give a real performance - Hopkinss rather poignant solution here - or a la Hemsworth and Portman do I wink at the audience? I prefer the goofier approach which is why even though Hemsworth isnt going to be cast in ""King Lear"" anytime soon hes the best thing about ""Thor."" Hes absorbed the central lesson of his musclehead movie forebears Beefcake is best when its making fun of itself. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence.)

The goofy outfit the tortured biblical language that big ol hammer Lets just say Spider-Man and the Hulk neednt worry about brand-name competition.Thor is part of Marvels highly anticipated Avengers franchise (launching next year) which creates an imperative to get to know him now. And so we have Thor a CGI-heavy action fantasy given a patina of literary class by director Kenneth Branagh. With its story of an arrogant god (Chris Hemsworth) exiled to Earth and at war with his vengeful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thor packages themes from Norse lore Shakespeare and the Bible and churns out a busy spectacle that moves surprisingly well. It may get a little silly but its not slow.Befitting a hero who straddles two worlds (or realms as the mythology has it) Thor divides its time between a pair of vastly different locales and tones. Up in Asgard where Thors pop Odin (Anthony Hopkins) reigns were given cosmic effects and burgeoning warfare with the Frost GiantsPee Wees Playhouse. Headstrong and combative Thor gets his dad angry and is punished with a one-way trip to New Mexico (bags fly free of course).Both character and movie loosen up a little on Earth where Hemsworth gets into the fish-out-of-water (god out of Asgard?) spirit. Befriended by a trio of scientists (Natalie Portman Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings a comic relief source who gets to tase the mighty one before drooling over his chiseled physique) the big guy tries to pull his hammer from a rock (in Arthurian fashion) encounters the government security organization S.H.I.E.L.D. and learns a bit of humility before facing his brother and heading home to settle scores. The contrast between fantastical realm and dusty Southwestern boonies works nicely.Thor is a competent piece of entertainment that doesnt have as much substance as it seems to think. Even with the above-average cast attacking age-old themes of sibling rivalry and hubris theres no real center of gravity here no epiphany moment to bolster the heros dilemma and divided nature. (It doesnt help that Portmans woman of science gets a tad giggly in the superhunks presence.) Were told that Thor comes from a place -- sorry a realm -- where science and magic are one and the same but the movie doesnt offer much ballast to support such heady ideas.Still as a more or less necessary table-setter for Marvels upcoming ensemble entree Thor serves its purpose. Its not a throwaway a la the disastrous 2003 Daredevil; it has ambition and I can see Hemsworth growing into the characters blend of godly swagger and earthbound self-mockery.The movie market will once again be oversaturated with superheroes in the coming weeks (Green Lantern and X-Men First Class should be swooping in any minute). Without a Dark Knight or Iron Man on this years docket the man with the hammer will have to do for now.ThorB Starring Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins Tom Hiddleston Stellan Skarsgard Kat Dennings and Rene Russo.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""THOR""  1/2 STAR RATING | Drama PG-13. 114 minutes. At area theaters ""Thor"" has two beginnings. Which is a fine strategy for an action flick that leaps nimbly between celestial realms once the cocky Norse warrior of the title is exiled to Earth. One finds astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) colleague Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and wisecracking assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) under the New Mexico sky waiting for a phenomenon Janes been tracking to recur. Naturally the trio gets more than they bargained for. The other start comes in a history lesson narrated with dulcet gravitas by Sir Anthony Hopkins who plays Thors father King Odin. The year is A.D. 965. The place Norway. The problem Frost Giants have set upon humans. Odin defeats Frost Giant Laufey (Colm Feore unrecognizable in ash-gray makeup and fiery eyes). Peace has existed for ages. When we first meet the adult Thor hes strutting into a grand hall -- tresses flowing smile ablaze famous weapon of choice in his hand. Hes a rock god not a Norse deity. Cue the beats. Its hammer time. Its this arrogance and an ill-advised excursion to confront Laufey that get the heir apparent tossed out of Asgard. Australian Chris Hemsworth (who suggests a softer yet butcher Brad Pitt) is appealing as the brawny brat whose banishment makes him a man and then a better deity. And ""Thor"" comes with a fine pedigree. In addition to Hopkins Brit Kenneth Branagh directs. His Shakespearean chops add texture in scenes that require the care and feeding of literatures grander themes pride paternity and honor. A notable shot finds Odin and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) talking of family secrets. It could have turned out pap -- but theres wounded sorrow in the exchange. For comedic relief theres Janes assistant Darcy (Dennings is terrific with the deadpan quips). From start to finale ""Thor"" has battles -- with otherworld beings but also set-tos with representatives of a clandestine government organizations. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the ""Iron Man"" franchise is on the scene. One of the finest skirmishes unfolds on an ice shelf in the land of the Frost Giants. Another has Thor walking down a dusty main street like a cowpoke heading for a not- OK-corral showdown. Still for all its clangorous brawls and crackling arcs of lightning ""Thor"" lacks a certain spark. The likable Portman has her way with a couple of laugh lines but the electricity between Jane and Thor is static at best.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr May 6 2011 Culture A review of the Kenneth Branagh-directed superhero movie Paramount Pictures The first written reference to the Norse god Thor is believed to have been by the Roman historian Tacitus in De Origine et situ Germanorum in 98 A.D. The first written reference to the superhero Thor wouldnt occur until 18 and a half centuries later in August 1962 in Marvel Comics Journey Into Mystery 83. The latter began ""Our story opens on the windy coast of Norway where we see a frail figure silhouetted against the bleak sky He is Dr. Don Blake an American vacationing in Europe And as Doctor Blake turns and leaves the site he doesnt see the strange alien spaceship which silently lands behind him"" Such innocence Such simplicity Such exclamatory punctuation The spaceship in question contains a gaggle of extraterrestrial invaders (the ""Stone Men from Saturn"") intent on enslaving humanity. Fleeing the craggy aliens Blake hides in a cave where he happens to find an old walking stick. When he accidentally bangs it against a rock it ignites like an otherworldly match and--poof--the stick transforms into a warhammer and the doctor into well hes initially not quite sure what. Long blond hair rippling biceps could he be Fabio? Such fears are quickly laid to rest when he reads the large block letters on the hammers side ""Whosoever holds this hammer if he be worthy shall possess the power of ...Thor."" (One cant help but wonder what Asgardian legalese might be hidden within that ellipsis.) Thor arrives in multiplexes a mere half-century later but in keeping with the temper of the times the movie does away with Norway the Saturnian Stone Men and the frail Dr. Blake himself. Directed by Kenneth Branagh (from whom the producers clearly hoped for a little Shakespearian oomph) the film opens as a cosmic tornado eases down on the smooth sands of New Mexico. Observing the phenomenon are astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) her avuncular mentor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a halfhearted intern (Kat Dennings). In an effort to get closer to the action the gang drive their van over a man standing dazedly at the epicenter of the storm. (Blond locks? Check. Biceps? Check.) ""Where did he come from?"" Jane exclaims. Glad you asked. A substantial chunk of backstory establishes that this is indeed Thor (Chris Hemsworth) newly banished from celestial Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Incited by his deceitful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the headstrong Teutonic hunk had caused a political incident by launching an unauthorized incursion against the frost giants of Jotunheim. His resulting sentence comingles the Christian and Arthurian Thor is sent to Earth to live life as a mortal and his hammer Mjolnir is implanted in the Southwestern bedrock from which it will only be pulled by one who is worthy--unlike at the moment Thor--of Thor-ness. Following his abrupt introduction to the front bumper of Janes van the Asgardian and the astrophysicist quickly begin exchanging interested glances. The attraction continues even after a zealous midlevel agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Clark Gregg reprising his role from the Iron Man films) confiscates Janes research and Thor tries with limited success to retrieve it. Of all the Silver-Age Marvel heroes (Spider-Man the Fantastic Four etc.) Thor was perhaps the highest-concept and hardest to relate to. He was after all a god--even if he spent his downtime as the fragile Dr. Blake (a notion the comics like the film eventually abandoned). In Branaghs telling (from a script by Ashley Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne) Thor and his fellow Asgardians are essentially extraterrestrials long ago mistaken for gods by superstitious Scandinavians. Accordingly the rainbow bridge between Asgard and Midgard (thats Earth to you and me) is reimagined as an interstellar wormhole machine--think Star Treks transporter but with Scotty replaced by mythical gatekeeper Heimdal. The whole aliens-mistaken-for-gods bit is also a way to add a little multiracial variety to the roster of Norse mythology Heimdal is played by The Wires Idris Elba; Hogun one of Thors warrior pals by Japanese star Tadanobu Asano. If all this sounds a bit like the last verse of Styxs ""Come Sail Away""--well it is. And it must be said that however good a job one might do of costuming such god/alien figures--and I think a reasonably good job was done here--theyre inevitably going to wind up looking pretty silly in their anachro-futurist armor. Perhaps the most off-key moment in the film is when Jane whos seen the topographically buff Thor in jeans and (sometimes) a t-shirt finally views him in full Asgardian regalia and declares ""Its a good look."" Not even astrophysicists have such appalling fashion sense. But for those willing to tolerate such aesthetic infractions Thor however preposterous is never quite stupid--which given the prevailing norms of contemporary action filmmaking is a notable accomplishment. Hemsworth (an Australian import best know to American audiences for his role as Kirks doomed dad in Star Trek) brings a dose of wit and charm to the lead role; Hiddleston underplays Loki nicely; and Portman Skarsgard Hopkins and Dennings deliver their customary talents. In keeping with the directive that All Roads Lead To The Avengers the movie is sprinkled with cross-pollinations a cameo by Hawkeye-to-be Jeremy Renner a direct reference to Tony Stark an indirect one to Bruce Banner. And there is of course the usual post-credit coda featuring Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury. The film may not be on a par with the best Marvel has offered us over the past several years--the initial Spider-Man and Iron Man the first two X-Men. But for those with a taste for the genre Thor is a worthy addition to the pantheon.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading daily sunny/Flickr What an Introvert Sounds Like Olga Khazan The World Well-Being Project uses Facebook updates to correlate language with personality traits. Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

But from where Im sitting the 3-D conversion job on Kenneth BranaghsThor looks like garbage. I begin with the utter pointlessness of it all because Thor doesnt need to be in stereo -- not for aesthetic reasons anyway so you can go ahead and buy the cheaper tickets. The visuals are breathtaking without it all swirling cosmic nebulae and mythic cityscapes of the Norse-god capital Asgard. With the exception of Thors handy flying hammer there just arent enough projectiles zooming through space to justify three-dimensional money shots. I suppose if Branagh had chosen to shoot the thing in 3-D he might have instructed the god of thunder to hurl a few lightning bolts directly at the camera. But he didnt shoot it in 3-D. He shot it in 2-D. The much-lauded Shakespearean interpreter did a fine job too tipping his camera at interesting arty angles and milking mighty histrionics from Chris Hemsworth (who plays the hulking Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (who plays jealous bro Loki). We can enjoy this Marvel Comics adaptation for what it is - a competent energetic and cheerfully hambone popcorn flick - except for the fact that everything seems as papery and flat as a hand of poker. At one point Thor and his pappy Odin (Anthony Hopkins rocking a horned helmet) are framed in spectacular profile against otherworldly vistas. Cool. But it doesnt look like three inhabited dimensions; it looks like layers of two. They may as well have stuck cardboard cutouts of the actors heads in front of old-style matte paintings the effect is so weirdly planar. The problem is more distracting in Asgard where elaborate visuals are nine-tenths of the show than in New Mexico where Thor lands after a blow-up with Odin over an unsanctioned assault on the realm of malevolent Frost Giants. On Earth he befriends a trio of scientists (a determined Natalie Portman a dazed Stellan Skarsgard and a quippy Kat Dennings) researching wormholes in the desert and there he learns the ins and outs of humdrum human life. Stripped of his powers and forced to wear a succession of ratty plaid shirts Thor retains his flowing locks his monstrous bod and his tendency to boss people around in archaic language. I dont know which I liked better the bit where he walks into a pet store demanding a horse (nice baffled reaction shot pet-shop worker) or the scene in the diner when he demands a second cup of coffee (""Another"") and smashes his mug on the floor. Hemsworth whom geeks will recall as Kirks dad in J.J. Abrams Star Trek is as likable as he is large a booming blond hulk with twinkly eyes and passable comic timing. Hell show up again in next years Avengers teased here in a post-credits Easter egg and a notable rooftop cameo. Hawk-eyed fans will also spot Thor creator Stan Lee behind the wheel of a truck - in three dimensions or two it hardly matters.

"Thor reviewed Who knew Thor was the god of sleep? Slate Sign In Sign Up Thor reviewed Who knew Thor was the god of sleep? Thor reviewed Who knew Thor was the god of sleep? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 5 2011 1123 PM Thor God of Boredom The all-powerful Scandinavian deserved better than this movie. By Dana Stevens Thor I experienced three brief bursts of pleasure during Thor (Paramount Pictures) Kenneth Branaghs 3-D adaptation of the Marvel comic book series two involved blond men smiling and the third came from a line reading by Natalie Portman. Chris Hemsworth the amply muscled Australian who plays the titular Norse god of thunder and Stellan Skarsgard who plays a Norwegian astrophysicist investigating unexplained phenomena in the New Mexico desert each had one moment when--portentous soundtrack and CGI spectacle aside--they seemed to be having good clean Scandinavian fun. And Portman as the astrophysicists plucky protege Jane took one particularly predictable bit of dialogue toward the end and skewed it unexpectedly toward the whimsical. The screen time taken up by these three surprises must have totaled about six seconds. All the rest of Thors 113 minutes felt so synthetic and overfamiliar that those brief flashes of spontaneity stood out like Morse code messages from another better movie. Look Ive accepted our comic-book overlords. I understand that those slim 20th-century periodicals which recounted the exploits of heroes in colored and paneled storyboards are now the founding documents of our popular culture and that we must revisit them each summer with solemn pomp like ancient Norsemen making their annual pilgrimage. And to its credit Thor does go relatively light on the solemn pomp (cf. those unexpected smiles). But the whole problem is that Thor only exists relative to other summer comic-book movies Is it better or worse than Iron Man 2? Deeper or shallower than Spiderman 3? More or less likely to flop at the box office than the upcoming The Green Lantern? Thors very competence is dispiriting--it gets the job done I guess but what job? Even a light popcorn entertainment can have a voice and a point of view--look at the sprightly first Iron Man film or Guillermo del Toros flawed but vivid Hellboy movies. Thor seems to have little more on its mind than winning the first weekend and making its money back overseas which it probably predictably will. Advertisement Its a shame because the storys mix of Old Norse mythology and 50s-style sci-fi (scientists in the desert menaced by enormous armor-clad aliens) had a real potential for loopy charm. Thor is one of two sons of King Odin of Asgard (Anthony Hopkins--did you even have to ask?). Odin is growing old and Asgard--an empyrean and timeless realm that looks like the Emerald City of Oz cast in pyrite--will soon need a new ruler. But when Thor picks a needless fight with his fathers ancient enemy the Frost Giants Odin ragefully casts him out of Asgard and onto Earth where the flaxen-haired behemoth lands in the middle of Portmans scientific expedition. Culture shock rages on both sides (short vs. tall woman vs. man scientist vs. supernatural being) while back in Asgard Thors younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) schemes to claim the throne. Perhaps your reaction to Thor will come down to how you feel about Chris Hemsworth who struck me as a generically pleasant slab of beefcake (am I the only viewer whos more attracted to Stellan Skarsgard?) but whom some critics are hailing as a star in the making. Whatever his gifts or lack thereof it isnt Hemsworths fault that his character evolves from bellicose hothead to scrambled-egg-serving nice guy much too quickly. The many long battle sequences are so dependent on computer augmentation that its impossible not to imagine the actors numbly jousting in front of a green screen. (The middling post-production 3-D neither adds nor takes away much.) Portman looks cute in her field-researcher togs and gets off that one fun line reading but the primary reaction she elicits in this viewer continues to be ""Oh theres Natalie Portman."" And the multi-ethnic pack of Norse deities who join forces to help Thor out of a jam get less individual characterization than televisions Superfriends. An extra scene tacked onto the end of the credit sequence neatly sets up the upcoming Marvel movie The Avengers (just as this movie was teased last summer in the closing credits of Iron Man 2). Its in these final seconds that Thor reveals at last its reason for existence This saga is but the portal to the birth of the next race of gods. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

"Thor | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; thor ) Thor (United States 2011) May 06 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note Thor is available in both 2-D and 3-D formats. I chose to see it in the former because of my growing dislike for the latter. Im satisfied with the decision. Thor is not a native 3-D production; it was converted after the fact. By all accounts the conversion is adequate but the 2-D offers visuals worthy of a spectacle with bright images vibrant colors dark scenes that arent muddy and no trace of blur during action sequences. Insofar as I can tell the 2-D version is the way to go especially since it doesnt demand paying extra money for the privilege of wearing uncomfortable glasses for two hours. Thor represents the first-ever melding of Norse mythology comic books and Shakespeare. Talk about ""something for everyone."" Still despite its diverse ingredients and the panache with which director Kenneth Branagh brings them all together its worth wondering whether Thor will be able to pull in the box office numbers that inevitably seem to accompany the release of a major superhero movie. For one thing its debatable whether the character of ""Thor"" could be considered an A-list character (in terms of overall popularity hes probably a B+). Then theres the question of whether Branagh has injected a little too much art into this would-be pop blockbuster. Remember Ang Lees Hulk beloved by critics hated by fans of the comic books. Perhaps the best thing that can be said about Thor is that it doesnt feel like a cookie-cutter superhero comic book origin story. Theres more heft and variety here than one expects from this obligatory chapter of a franchise. The screenplay borrows frequently and carelessly from mythology and from its graphic source material incorporating the back story into the main plot. Ironically in an era when most movies are too slow and too long Thor might have benefitted from an extra quarter-hour or so; there are instances in which the story moves almost too quickly with transitions sometimes shortened or altogether dropped. The central love story for example is given so little time to percolate that it feels artificial. A full 30 minutes is devoted to the prologue that introduces the denizens of Asgard including the king Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). An ill-advised retaliatory strike by Thor into Jotunheim the realm of the Frost Giants with the goal of bringing the Asgardians ancient enemy Laufey (Colm Feore) the Frost Giant King to heel endangers centuries of fragile peace and enrages Odin. The one-eyed god strips his first-born of his powers and banishes him to Earth. There Thor is discovered wandering in the middle of the New Mexico desert by scientists Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) raving about his hammer. As Thor attempts to adjust to 21st century Earth culture and convince people including SHIELD agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Jane of his true identity (and that hes not merely a homeless lunatic with special ops training) he senses the lesson Odin intended for him through his banishment. Meanwhile in Asgard with Thor out of the way Loki puts into place a plan that will result in him ruling the Nine Realms. Branagh the premiere living cinematic interpreter of Shakespeare finds plenty of hooks to the works of the Bard either in the text or the subtext of Thor including ""King Lear"" ""Henry IV"" and ""Othello."" Thats not to say the film plays out like a summer reading assignment; on the contrary those who know nothing of Shakespeares works wont be squirming with impatience or wallowing in ignorance. Thor unfolds like an action-adventure epic that fits nicely into Marvels ever-expanding movie universe. In addition to curbing some of his more operatic flourishes (this movie is more restrained than two previous non-Shakespeare movies Dead Again and Frankenstein) Branagh shows a perhaps unexpected degree of comfort with special effects. These are not top-notch ILM computer-generated images but theyre good enough to get the job done. Chris Hemsworth (almost but not quite an unknown - having played Kirks father in J.J. Abrams Star Trek) proves to be an inspired choice as the God of Thunder possessing not only the good looks and physique required for the part but the ability to express the range of emotions necessary to take Thor on his emotional arc from arrogance and entitlement to humility and virtue. In many ways Thor is Marvels incarnation of Superman; Hemsworth brings and edge to the character that will keep him from becoming bland. Tom Hiddleston a classically-trained British actor plays Thors most interesting character the conflicted Loki. Had Shakespeare scripted the movie it would have focused on Odins younger son and thats where a lot of Branaghs energy is channeled. Thats not to say that Loki has a more prominent role than Thor but his contribution is not marginalized. Hes less of a clear-cut villain than most bad guys we encounter in superhero movies. He has Daddy issues feels like an outcast within his own home and has grown jealous of living in Thors shadow. Hiddleston plays the character with such passion invested in the gray areas that its hard not to feel a sense of sympathy for Loki. The rest of the cast is rounded out with pedigreed actors who arent given a lot to do. Anthony Hopkins Odin doesnt have the screen time to develop into much more than the stern God-king. Stellan Skarsgaard does little more than occasionally move the plot along and provide alternating snippets of sage advice and comedic relief. Natalie Portmans Jane is underwritten and underused. Her characters budding romance with Thor is not credible due more to the rushed screenplay than to any deficiency in the actors chemistry. The writers might have been served by bringing on board a romantic comedy veteran to flesh out the skeletal love story which were supposed to accept even though we dont believe it. There are times when Thor feels like an extended teaser for The Avengers although that sense isnt as apparent as it was during parts of Iron Man 2. Still Branagh does his best to mold his movie into a self-contained adventure rather than a prologue to Marvels 2012 superhero overdose. Samuel L. Jackson doesnt make an appearance until the obligatory post-credits sequence which reveals something about the possible direction in which The Avengers is headed. Thor is more about grand scenes and moments of spectacle than it is about traditional action. There are a couple of battle scenes but they dont generate a surfeit of tension. This is especially true of the mandatory Loki/Thor smackdown which amounts to little more than some clanging of weapons and throwing around of special effects. Those who are looking for high-octane action may be disappointed by what this film has to offer. Those satisfied with an understanding of the complex mythology surrounding the character coupled with the entertaining ""fish out of water"" that results from a God wandering around 21st century America may be delighted. Branaghs Thor is big enough and bold enough to fit under the Marvel umbrella but infused with sufficient uniqueness to make it work for those weary of generic superhero stories.

You see a car headed your way and you do that stutter-step maneuver half dipping your foot into the stream of traffic but not fully committing on the off chance the driver has been momentarily struck by blindness. A couple hundred thousand years of evolution implores you not to proceed but your modern intellect attempts to convince you it will all work out because you dont want to have that embarrassing scenario play out where the driver does the facetious ""after you"" hand motion as you stand there like a bumpkin at the side of the crosswalk. This in a microcosm is Thor a film that absolutely should exist but for entirely commercial reasons. Past that it has no real momentum no life force no undefinable quality which makes it in the least bit remarkable. You cant fault Thor for stepping into the crosswalk because not making it would have been a less intelligent call but once you see it in full stride you realize its not a gem; its an average film gently loping along hoping not to stand out. Thor commences with Natalie Portman in a storm. Shes chasing weather anomalies with uber-likable Kat Dennings at the wheel and Stellan Skarsgard in tow. Portman has been able to predict 17 straight weather disturbances but this one is a little different as a shadowy figure emerges right in the middle of the tumult. Then were whisked off to Asgard Whats an Asgard? Thors domicile which comes off as a cross between the worlds of Speed Racer and Tron Legacy. Exciting right? The first problem Thor has is Thor. Chris Hemsworth is winning and likable but its tough to relate to a god. Bruce Wayne is rich but people become rich every so often. Spider-Man was an awkward kid first and a ""dancin on the street"" suave web-slinger only after some personal growth. The closest parallel would be Superman but Supes embodies humility and goodness where Thor is bravado and brute force. Theres also the issue of scope as the New Mexico and Asgard locales make up the entirety of the film.Wait no theres another planet a ""bad guy"" planet were asked to care about as the film progresses. To my surprise Asgard and the internal politics thereof were placed front and center here. Anthony Hopkins is Thors papa Odin and hes about to relinquish the crown to his eldest son. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is his youngest son and Rene Russo portrays Odins wife. Anyone with a passing knowledge of Norse mythology should see the plot line of this film telegraphed a mile away and the complexity level isnt all there. There ARE bad guys who are bad because they are bad and every so often a member of the Thor posse acts in a manner thats not technically good. But again motivations are never really explored which makes the culmination of Thor feel pretty irrelevant. Thor is a film that also desperately wants it both ways. Were supposed to take the consequences (Asgard is in peril) seriously without any attempt at context. Were supposed to accept that Portman and Hemsworth like each other because they talked for a few minutes. Were expected to smirk along with the film at Thors ignorance of Earths culture all the while intuiting that hes aware of Earth and here to help. Asgard is also problematic in that it is presented as a dream world (with rainbow roads straight out of Mario Kart) where they have feasts and know magic but then real-world problems arise that dont gibe with the established tone. It doesnt ever really add up though the first hour does work as a fantasy epic almost in the vein of a Narnia movie. To that point we can safely call 70 of the 110 minutes solid. Centering the movie almost entirely around New Mexico and Asgard helps in the sense that it provides focus. This isnt a sprawling epic with global ramifications or at least not Earths globe. New Mexico seems to be in some sort of peril for a few minutes but its a fleeting danger. Unfortunately this focus also destroys much of the final third of the film as consequences and choices start undoing the momentum of the piece. For instance you could argue (and Im happy youre doing so) that Thor is a film full of questions without context or ramification. Natalie Portman is a researcher but why does her research matter? Asgard has dealings with Earth but how and why? Many things within Thor must be accepted at face value but these very things are what make the whole enterprise feel inconsequential. To enjoy Thor is to simply enjoy bright lights and loud noises though the 3-D aspect is largely wasted as well. Enjoyment here isnt impossible but you wont be amazed when the end credits roll (and you await that patented after credits scene). Thor is the typical summer superhero film and the genre has become formulaic enough that a decent version can be produced without much fuss. Thor is fine but its not exceptional on any front. Still I look forward to watching the character in The Avengers. I could see 15 good minutes out of Thor even if theres not nearly enough to hang a sequel on. Thor wont be remembered as an innovator or genre-shifter and with a glut of superhero films imminent Thor likely wont be remembered at all.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 05 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Thunderation these are some mediocre gods. Im referring of course to the first blockbuster of the season always a seminal event on any calendar and thus worthy of prompt report. Alas the news is mixed Thor aint much of a movie but its a great career move. Both movie and move belong to director Kenneth Branagh heretofore best known for interpreting the Bard. Now obviously as cinematic franchises go Shakespeare and his paltry canon pale before the might of Marvel Comics. So credit Branagh with much shrewd ambition in trading up from iambic pentameter to cartoon balloons from that melancholy Dane with his dull soliloquies to this Norse behemoth with his really mean hammer. Too bad the credit stops there. Movies Thor The official trailer Film Its hammer time A guide to the summers blockbuster films The pre-title sequence sees Thor dropping from the skies as the gentle rain from heaven upon this place ... oops sorry thats the old Branagh. Here a flashback quickly returns us to the ""eternal realm"" of Asgard where the gods reside in what thanks to a shoddy CGI shot of crooked golden spires looks rather like a messy celestial pawnshop. Speaking of resemblances theres Anthony Hopkins playing the god-in-chief with a spiffy metallic eye patch and a long coiffed mane - yep its Odin looking like True Grits Rooster Cogburn all dressed up for a formal hoedown. Dont worry though. Thor essayed by Aussie newcomer Chris Hemsworth is cut from more conventional Nordic cloth - blond chiselled ripped and awfully keen to make war on those frosty neighbours to the north. Cue the first battle sequence where Branagh proves that behind a moving camera hes altogether conventional too. Know this If cluttered badly edited action is boring then cluttered badly edited action in 3-D is suffocatingly boring. And the rule holds throughout. Whenever the action breaks out so does our suffocation - were just buried in antic motion and noise. Happily for us if not for Thor the mania abates when Odin takes exception to his sons bellicose ways strips him of rank and superpowers and even his trusty hammer then banishes him all the way to our good Earth. New Mexico to be precise where Natalie Portman fresh off her gig as a black swan pops up as a beige astrophysicist. Yet not so beige that she doesnt take a shine to this muscled E.T. dropped like manna from heaven. Even minus his superpowers the hunk is quite a catch. But if youre expecting romantic chemistry prepare for disappointment - Thor may be flinty but hes not much on sparks. At this point Branagh starts taking pains to put the comic into the comic book - stuff like our busted god chugging down a brewski with the locals or stomping into a pet shop and demanding a horse. Briefly the picture picks up some breezy momentum but at the loss of its mythic dignity. Even in blockbuster-land maybe especially in block-buster land a myth has to hold its head high. Its fine for Iron Man to have his irony but last time I checked Norse deities werent big on yuks. Its as if Branagh fearful that his artsy reputation precedes him has gone to the opposite extreme and low-balled the material. Even the mighty hammer appears small and mingy - all that CGI frippery at his disposal and Thors thunderstick looks like something pulled off the bottom shelf at Home Depot. Oh well. Back on the inflationary front our hero still has a giant robot to face down a colossally evil brother to tend to and with his powers plugged in again another suffocating battle to fight back in that celestial pawnshop. And thats pretty much the finish at least until the weekend rolls by and the real business begins - toting up the box-office receipts to see whether this mediocrity will earn superior bucks enough to justify Branaghs upward mobility and even make good on his final-frame promise of a sequel. If so hey alls well that ends well.

Directed by noted Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh with a class-act grasp of how action works best when it defines character instead of obliterating it Thor comes on like thunder delivering epic fireworks that dont neglect the dramatic sparks ignited between father and son brother and brother and lovers from two different worlds. The Complete Archive Over 20 Years of Peter Travers Movie Reviews Now Online Hemsworth an Aussie actor with a vocal command to match his heaving brawn doesnt just play the role he owns it. Im expecting both sexes will feel his impact. Teaming Thor in the upcoming Avengers with other Marvel heroes (Iron Man Captain America and others) sounds like a party suitable even for ladies night.

Starring Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins Chris Hemsworth Idris Elba Ray Stevenson Kat Dennings Stellan Skarsgard Rene Russo Jaimie Alexander Director Kenneth Branagh Running time 210 Release Opened May 6 2011  Editorial Review With that hammer he nails itBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 6 2011The early fanboy-on-the-street reviews of ""Thor"" are in.""In the realm of Marvel comic-book characters Thor isnt my favorite"" one young man said to his date as he practically skipped down the sidewalk after a screening of the Kenneth Branagh-directed live-action flick about the hammer-wielding Norse god/action hero. ""But that [expletive] was tight.""Now there are a couple of interesting things going on in that paragraph not the least of which is the word ""date"" in the same sentence as the word ""fanboy."" (We kid we kid. Please do not send angry e-mails.)Lets unpack it.If you are the sort of person who cannot imagine beginning a sentence with the words ""In the realm of Marvel comic-book characters"" -- in fact if you are the sort of person who cannot imagine using the word ""tight"" except in reference to your pants where it wouldnt be a compliment -- then consider yourself forewarnedThis [expletive] isnt for you.If on the other hand you have a fondness for loud silly eye-popping action adventure films based on beloved superhero characters -- or even superhero characters who are appreciated with the cool clinical detachment of a student of pop culture -- then ""Thor"" delivers.The effects are effective. The humor is humorous and just self-referential enough to let you know the film doesnt take itself too seriously. And in the role of Thor -- an arrogant god who is banished to present-day Earth from his celestial home of Asgard after he defies his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) -- the blond Australian hunk Chris Hemsworth seems born to the part.""Where did he come from?"" asks astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) after she and her research associates Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) discover Thor in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Our guess is a gym in Melbourne. Hes pretty buff when he changes into jeans and a T-shirt. But we digress.The film divides the world neatly into two camps.On one side are those who will recognize the names Volstagg Hogun Fandral and Sif as Thors homeboys and homegirl from Asgard. (Theyre played respectively by Ray Stevenson Tadanobu Asano Josh Dallas and Jaimie Alexander.) In the film Lady Sif and the Warriors Three as theyre known follow their exiled and now largely powerless friend from Asgard to Earth where Thor must learn the lesson of humility before he can again pick up his mighty hammer called Mjolnir -- or as Darcy calls it sarcastically ""myeh-nyeh"" -- and return home to defeat his usurping brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).On the other side are those for whom this whole thing sounds like a just a bunch of myeh-nyeh. People for whom Lady Sif Hogun and Fandral will look less like the immortal gods they are meant to be than as one wag in the film describes them ""Xena Jackie Chan and Robin Hood.""A Norse god in a tight tee? Natalie Portman as an astrophysicist? (Okay she went to Harvard but still.) Even the bad guys wreaking havoc back in Asgard called Frost Giants -- whose power seems to be the ability to inflict really bad freezer burn -- seem more of threat to frozen peas than to the future of the nine realms.Dont ask.You know what? Theres plenty of fun to be had here and not just for those who will get excited over Jeremy Renners cross-promotional cameo as archer Hawkeye (another Marvel character who -- duh -- will be featured in the upcoming film ""The Avengers"").""Thor"" isnt for everyone. But its silly summer sensibility might just convert one or two more open-minded members of the myeh-nyeh crowd.Contains violent action and brief mild obscenity.

Photo Zade Rosenthal Natalie Portman stars as an astrophysicist. (Zade Rosenthal) ""Thor"" is as serviceable as a hammer and about as subtle. Director Kenneth Branagh whips up a tempest of spirits from the vasty deep zooming characters through the universe without spaceships filling the screen with clanking metal and staging a smackdown on a disco bridge that changes colors like the dance floor in ""Saturday Night Fever."" Theres plenty of smash thunder and brawl for the kids. But in taking a bit of Hulk and a bit of Superman while re-imagining Excalibur as a hammer ""Thor"" amounts to putting new horns on old ideas. And the screenplay sounds like the lyrics of Spinal Tap. Thor (charmlessly played by a slab of muscle called Chris Hemsworth) is a Norse prince from another planet with the looks of Bjorn Borg but the temper of John McEnroe. He lives in what appears to be a giant brass pipe organ in the exurbs of the universe where his one-eyed father the king (Anthony Hopkins) raised him alongside his dark-haired shifty-eyed brother Loki (a watery Tom Hiddleston). Im not sure why I felt Loki might not be all that pleased to spend his life bowing before the awesomeness of his sibling. But if Branagh had placed a neon light blinking VILLAIN over his head it would have been the same movie except slightly wittier. A.D. 965 turns out to be the critical year in Nordic mythology. The year of the first ABBA joke? Approximately but also the time when back on Earth Thors daddy (Fathor?) defeated his archenemies the Frost Giants oaken blue dudes who look like thug Navis. A truce has prevailed ever since. But after the Frost Giants interrupt Thors coronation ceremony a gilt-edged affair that looks like it was styled by the design team of Cecil B. DeMille and Donald Trump the blond hothead disobeys the old man and jets through space to try to hammer some sense into the enemy clan. Loki does much smirking. Keep your eye on this one. The King strips Thor of his superpowers and exiles him from the planet though he also tosses overboard the familys mighty magical hammer so that Thor can find it and get his powers back. Meanwhile in New Mexico an astrophysicist (Natalie Portman) and her sidekicks (Stellan Skarsgard Kat Dennings) are investigating strange weather phenomena when Thor drops in for a visit. The drab attempts at love scenes between Portman and Hemsworth amount to ""Me Tarzan you Jane"" chatter and when Thor goes flexing around town he is simply Hulk with a better complexion. When Thors four friends visit from back home to pass along a message they turn out to be the dullest quartet since Nickelback. Nor do the effects mark new a standard. There is a slight whiff of bargain shopping in the production and the look seems like state of the art for 2003. Unlike the ""Iron Man"" movies ""Thor"" is almost entirely without wit. Thor says ""Hammer Hammer"" and someone replies ""Yeah we can tell youre hammered."" Other gags include the hero getting knocked over by a car (twice) and knocked out by a Taser wielded by a college student. Yet when its time for Thor to storm the compound where his hammer sticks out of the earth waiting for him like Excalibur he duly whips every super-trained soldier in sight. You cant have it both ways guys. He cant be a fish out of water when you need a cheap joke and a mighty machine when you want action. And why does Thor burst into a puppy shop to demand ""I need a horse"" when hes already been getting around in cars? For a god this guy sounds a lot like Animal from ""The Muppet Show."" The ripping outer-space fights are the main attraction and theyre mostly entertaining though not in a way that will make you feel good about yourself. How much pleasure should an adult derive from contemplation of a villain wearing a black polyurethane motorcycle helmet with two horns that curve back like bumblebee antennae who actually cries ""Ha HA"" as he grapples with our hero on that disco bridge? In moments of weakness Thor says things like ""I need sustenance"" So do I buddy. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next ON THE RUNWAY Read Next ON THE RUNWAY Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43710 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 28221 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17148 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 6 2011 1201 a.m. ET Like Thors hammer this ersatz epic bludgeons its victims into submission. Whats more it requires them to stare at the source of their punishment through 3-D glasses. No need for submitting blindly to that. The 3-D process in question is one of those aftermarket fakes that enhances mainly mid-distance bodies and structural elements within the frame so you can take the glasses off during most of the close-ups--and much of the movie is shot in pitiless close-ups. I saw it in IMAX which made everything bigger and louder and therefore worse except for some impressive images of Asgard. Thats the bronze-tinted celestial realm where the young God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) struggles against evil forces and his own impetuousness. The movie itself struggles against all-encompassing ponderousness. When Thor is exiled to Earth cosmic bombast gives way to the terrestrial banality of his romance with Natalie Portmans astrophysicist Jane who talks earnestly about resolving her particle data and knows about Einstein-Rosen bridges the fanciful wormholes through which bad guys and good guys alike shuttle between realms like Metro North commuters. If this is a harbinger of the season to come may heaven and its suburbs help us. Last week the surprise was ""Fast Five"" the enjoyable product of a presumably extinct summer franchise. This week the surprise is that Marvel Studios which did brilliantly with ""Iron Man"" and not disastrously with its sequel has brought forth a concatenation of oafish action sequences and narrative fragments in search of a lighter tone. ENLARGE Chris Hemsworth and the mighty hammer of Thor. Paramount Pictures The actors cant be blamed considering what theyve got to work with. Mr. Hemsworth is a commanding physical presence and a likeable one whenever hes given a chance. (In certain scenes he seems to be reaching for the state of comedic grace that Amy Adams attained in ""Enchanted."") Ms. Portmans character is barely sketched let alone fully drawn. Her intern/sidekick played by Kat Dennings is a cipher. Ditto for the Warriors Three (do you really want to know their names?) and the warrior-maiden Sif (Jaimie Alexander) who on their sojourns to Earth look like refugees from ""Galaxy Quest."" Only Thors evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) gets to declaim any flavorsome lines. Theyre not really good lines since theyre all about being bad though theyre better than the Olympian drivel that Anthony Hopkins must intone as Asgards aging King Odin. All of this leads to the subject of the script for which three writers get final discredit. (No thats not a Writers Guild term.) And the subject of the script leads to the luckless director who had to stage it Kenneth Branagh. Mr. Branagh is an accomplished filmmaker as well as a fine actor; his production of ""Hamlet"" is a model of what filmed theater can be. But what possessed Marvel to hire him? Did they think the celestial conflict between Asgard and the Frost Giants had a Shakespearean dimension? If so the studios decision had a delusional dimension. Mr. Branagh isnt an alchemist who might have turned this dross into gold and hes certainly not an action director though how much that matters is open to question since the action sequences bear all the earmarks of studio-imposed computer-generated (and fuzzily photographed) frenzy. Bodies hurtle armor clanks force fields spark vortexes swirl oceans roil warriors freeze and defrost and none of it conveys a scintilla of feeling. Watch a clip of Jodie Fosters latest film The Beaver starring Mel Gibson. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. ENLARGE Jodie Foster Mel Gibson and the titular therapeutic puppet in The Beaver. Summit Entertainment The Beaver Bizarre and belabored yet grimly fascinating ""The Beaver"" opens on Mel Gibson looking anguished while a narrator who sounds a bit like Michael Caine says ""This is a picture of Walter Black a hopelessly depressed individual."" That doesnt seem promising but the film which was directed by Jodie Foster delivers more than it promises--namely a performance that draws on exceptional skill as well as what one irresistibly takes to be the real-life anguish of a movie star whose own life has come to ruin. The narrator as it develops is Walter himself and the toothsome rodent of the title is a glove puppet that he wears on his left hand. Through the beaver Walter suddenly and almost exclusively begins to express himself--in an English accent--to his worried wife Meredith (who is played by Ms. Foster) his dismayed teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) and to startled colleagues at work. Im not telling you anything you cant find in the trailer and thats part of the problem with Kyle Killens screenplay. Its a drama that not only depends on a single device--artifice being the writers glove puppet--but deprives us of any sense of discovery by spelling out the devices meaning in a card that Walter gives to everyone he meets ""The person who handed you this is under the care of a prescription puppet designed to create a psychological distance between himself and the destructive aspects of his personality."" Lest that be insufficiently diagnostic the point is emphasized in a pair of parallelisms. Porter writes term papers for other students but cant express himself and Porters artistic girlfriend Norah has given up painting because...did you think Id spell everything out? So whats to recommend in ""The Beaver""? First but not least Jennifer Lawrence playing Norah. I wish this hadnt been her first released film since ""Winters Bone""; the role doesnt deserve her. Still she fills every moment of it--even a manipulative graduation speech--with warmth and graceful intelligence. Then theres the man to the right of the puppet by turns tortured morose animated or charming. When I first met Mel Gibson in Sydney almost 35 years ago he was a handsome young actor with an open face a winning smile an abundant gift and a bright future although no one could have imagined the extent of his success or the depth of his fall. The gift remains. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke plays the trumpet in Passion Play. Image Entertainment/Everett Collection Passion Play Every now and then a movies awfulness rises to the level of mystery. How did it get produced? Did anyone try to save the filmmaker from himself? Given the gloppily sentimental substance of ""Passion Play"" didnt anyone find the title ever so slightly grandiose? This film brings us the resistible pairing of Mickey Rourke and Megan Fox. Hes Nate a battered and lugubrious trumpet player whos down on his luck. Shes Lily an angel with wings--very nice wings with fluffy feathers--who works as a side-show freak in a seedy carnival. ""Do you wanna see my wings?"" Lily asks in a girlish voice. ""If you wanna see them just ask me."" Anyone with any sense would wanna see them so its easy to understand Nates pleasure when she unfurls them and hard to understand the displeasure of a plastic surgeon when Nate nixes the idea of clipping them. ""Amazing as she is"" the surgeon says tartly ""its not normal."" No its not but then neither is a movie so consistently drained of energy that its dialogue is delivered at a steady-state mumble. (The only relief is provided by Christopher Doyles cinematography which fills the turgid stretches with striking images.) This is the directorial debut of Mitch Glazer who worked from his own screenplay. Back in 1988 he and Michael ODonoghue wrote ""Scrooged"" the wonderfully funny update of ""A Christmas Carol"" that starred Bill Murray. This helps to explain Mr. Murrays presence in ""Passion Play"" where he too mumbles his way through a mournful performance as Lilys tormentor a gangster named Happy Shannon. As for Ms. Fox she may have seen the movie as a chance to spread her wings in the dramatic realm but its a no-fly zone for all concerned. DVD FOCUS The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers (2002) Instead of the low-rent adventures of ""Thor"" treat yourself to Peter Jacksons ""The Lord of the Rings."" Any one of the three films will do but this wondrous thunderous spectacle is my favorite. The forces of evil are in the ascendancy during most of the three-hour running time but you can bet the shire on the forces of good--and not just J.R.R. Tolkiens desperate alliance of Hobbits humans and elves. An army of filmmakers led by Mr. Jackson has made the trilogys central section a ringing testament to the power of movies. Magic (1978) The notion of a hero possessed by a puppet or a dummy has long been a horror mainstay in the movies and on TV. I wouldnt be surprised if Kyle Killen had seen ""Dead of Night"" before writing ""The Beaver."" The 1945 English film stars Michael Redgrave as a schizophrenic ventriloquist tormented by his dummy but its unavailable on American home video. A good and creepy alternative is ""Magic"" with the pre-Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins as a ventriloquist whose dummy has a vicious mind of its own. Richard Attenborough directed from a novel by William Goldman. Brewster McCloud (1970) Bud Cort who has a small role in ""Passion Play"" plays the title role in Robert Altmans eccentric--and by now almost unknown--fable about a loner who lives deep below the Houston Astrodome and dreams of flying inside it with a pair of strapped-on wings. Not even the most ardent fans of this seminal American filmmaker--and I count myself among them--would represent ""Brewster McCloud"" as a successful film but its certainly an interesting one.

"Thor brews a perfect storm of effects action - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Thor brews a perfect storm of effects action By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions It takes a director known for his Shakespearean acumen to make a spectacular summer action movie filled with epic battles and familial struggles. By Zade Rosenthal Marvel Studios Bringing him back down to Earth Thor (Chris Hemsworth) the god of thunder is dropped into the desert to learn a lesson in humility. EnlargeClose By Zade Rosenthal Marvel Studios Bringing him back down to Earth Thor (Chris Hemsworth) the god of thunder is dropped into the desert to learn a lesson in humility. Under Kenneth Branaghs direction Thor has eye-popping special effects strong performances and perhaps most notably 3-D technology put to good use. Though the plot has some holes the dazzling look of the movie and the earth-rattling action sequences fill in those gaps. Based on a Marvel superhero comic with Norse mythology origins this god of thunder tosses off enough comic quips to make the whole enterprise enjoyable. Not only is it great to look at -- thanks to the fusion of superb CGI and the impeccable work of production designer Bo Welch -- its anchored by an appealing performance by Chris Hemsworth. Though he looks every inch a brawny Norse god Hemsworth is not just a hunk. His charisma and charming grin go a long way toward making Thor engaging. Jane (Natalie Portman) Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) make up a trio of contemporary scientists who happen upon a disoriented Thor who crash-lands in the New Mexico desert. MORE Chris Hemsworth thunders in Thors wise father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has banished his hot-tempered son from Asgard to teach him a lesson about arrogance. Meanwhile Thors brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some tricks up his sleeve. Portman and Hemsworth have good chemistry. They spend a night under the stars and talk magic and science. ""Your ancestors called it magic and you call it science"" Thor tells her. ""I come from a place where theyre one and the same."" But his best lines are comic quips variations on the fish-out-of-water scheme. About the movie Thor   out of fourStars Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Anthony Hopkins Stellan Skarsgard Idris Elba Kat DenningsDirector Kenneth BranaghDistributor Paramount PicturesRating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violenceRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Thors magic hammer also lands in the desert which draws the spy/law enforcement men in suits the S.H.I.E.L.D. In their midst is a cameo by Jeremy Renner poised with bow and arrow. (His character Hawkeye will have more screen time in Joss Whedons adaptation of The Avengers which is due in theaters next year.) The best scenes are the electrifying battles between the Norse gods and their nemeses the imposing Frost Giants. Sharply honed icicles vs. Thors mighty hammer create massive crumbling mayhem. This is where the 3-D comes into play stunningly along with Thor rocketing to Earth amid what looks like the aurora borealis. Thors glimmering home in the gods realm of Asgard has a gilded Vegas look -- and the palace resembles a giant pipe organ -- but somehow it works. Fans of The Lord of the Rings will recognize some visual ""borrowing."" (Shall we call it an homage?) Though it may not leave a lasting impression once the lights go up Thor is lighthearted and thunderously good fun. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

All the requisite ingredients are wedged in romance redemption a giant invincible robot. But it seems no one was paying attention to overall quality control. More about Thor >> Based on the Marvel comic book series Thor stars Aussie hunk Chris Hemsworth as the pulverizing Norse god. (Not that it matters but Hemsworth looks a good deal more like NFL receiver Jeremy Shockey than he does the immortal Avenger.) As our story begins Thor is about to succeed his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as the ruler of Asgard a realm that resembles the Emerald City as redecorated by King Midas. Like most elaborate CGI sets Asgard looks magnificent and chintzy at the same time. Stuff happens and Thor tries to solve things a little too forcefully. Hey when youre a superhero with a hammer the whole universe looks like a nail. An incensed Odin strips his son of his powers and banishes him to Earth. Its a cut-rate exile as Thor condenses Earth into a small flyblown Potemkin Village in the desert. With a reported budget of 150 million most of the film transpires on a set that makes Tremors look like Inception. The guys in the cast (including Ray Stevenson and Colm Feore) fare all right because they can strut around like theyre in a cartoonish version of Henry IV. But the women are less fortunate particularly Natalie Portman as a brilliant independent astrophysicist who goes weak-kneed and giddy the moment she meets a man with biceps. As Thors mother Rene Russo is reduced to flashing occasional looks of concern. Our Goldilocks god has a thing or two to learn when he arrives on our planet. Striding into a modest pet store he demands ""I need a horse"" But in remarkably short order he discovers the values of sacrifice humility patience and compassion. Like its protagonist Thor is handsome but vacuous. It is a triumph only for the costume department the helmets and hammers division. The 3-D effects are largely superfluous adding only depth of field. Maybe IMAX will lend Thor the grandeur it thorly lacks. Because as fanciful as the source materials are as rich the mythology this is a thudding failure of imagination. Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrand phillynews.com.

Kat Dennings Watch Clips I Cast You Out I Cast You Out Credit Paramount Pictures A Puny Weapon A Puny Weapon Credit Paramount Pictures Youre Big Youre Big Credit Paramount Pictures Its origin-story time again at the multiplex Godlike superhero falls from sky and gets adopted by earthlings who discover in short order that he is in fact a godling. The earthlings in question are astrophysicist Natalie Portman and her assistant Kat Dennings who are accompanied by a mentor played by Stellan Skarsgard. (Because they needed someone who might credibly be up on his Norse mythology?) While those three take their charge to the hospital the film heads for a flashback in Asgard whence he fell. In that realm which seems to have been imagined for the purposes of this picture by Maxfield Parrish we meet our heros trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his one-eyed dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) whos seriously annoyed about the war Thors started with the Frost Giants. Hopkins is classically trained as is director Kenneth Branagh who naturally sets him to conjuring verbal thunderbolts straight out of King Lear. ""You have betrayed the express command of your king opened this peaceful realm and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of waaaarrrrrrrr"" thunders Odin before banishing him to Midgard (Earth). With Hopkins Hiddleston and Hemsworth hurricanes hardly happen. (I know a My Fair Lady joke? In my defense this is sort of a Pygmalion story the tale of a Thor loser learning humility when hes not throwing hammers.) Anyway with Hopkins (hammy) Hiddleston (nuanced) and Hemsworth (bellowing) hurricanes happen only if by hurricanes you mean windy dialog. Happily things feel more down-to-earth down on Earth where Thors hammer lodges itself in a stone Excalibur-style and can only be pulled out by someone whos earned the right to be king. Thors comics-medium creator the legendary Stan Lee has a quick cameo trying to extricate it as do some men in black aided by Jeremy Renners Hawkeye.

Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios Jane Foster (Natalie Portman right) an astrophysicist who discovers Thor in the desert guides the hero through life among humankind. Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios But the dude with the blond mane and bulging biceps clearly owns that hammer. And when the screenplay gives him something besides arrogance to work with he owns the movie too -- a frat-boy god-out-of-water amusingly clueless about when throwing his weight around is manly and appealing and when it just makes him a jerk. In a diner say smashing coffee cups. In the Marvel Comics firmament Thor qualifies a second-tier superhero and despite its classier-than-usual director his films kind of second-tier too with lavish effects and big digital battles that register as pretty routine even in 3-D -- although setting one showdown on a Wild West main street counts as a nice touch a month after Rango and three months before Cowboys And Aliens. Less nice is wasting Japans hippest movie star Tadanobu Asano in a bland sidekick role and not getting Natalie Portman to make much of a case for inter-realm romance. Except for Hiddleston who brings a bit of nuance to Lokis machinations secondary characters arent this films strong point. But give the producers credit for casting that slab of beefcake with the blazing smile. Hemsworth looks and acts like a comic-book superhero come to life -- no 3-D or special effects required.

"Thor movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Superhero comes down to EarthThor story picks up when he travels to New Mexico -- 3 starsMay 05 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAt this point in the Marvel Comics-derived superhero cycle audiences can be forgiven for feeling a tad worn out both for reasons of quality and quantity. My rear ends thor just thinking about how many more we have coming. Yet sometimes a product exceeds expectations.I like ""Thor"" for example. This is remarkable considering the lameness of the first 25 minutes of director Kenneth Branaghs adaptation of the Marvel character introduced in 1962.A stolid visual stylist at best Branagh lays out the early scenes in this interplanetary saga with as little cinematic interest as is humanly and digitally possible. Computer-generated hordes mill around while the King of Asgard gives a speech; crushing action sequences full of fire and ice place the actors far too close to the camera; hacky nervous editing (by Paul Rubell) neither propels nor maximizes the flow of the action.Then as if by decree from the Beard of Odin itself your ""X-Men Origins"" headache recedes the mighty intergalactic Thunder God travels to Earth and ""Thor"" acquires a sense of humor and becomes that thing that all creatures from all realms crave a good time. The last 25 minutes of ""Thor"" arent much better than the first. But that hour in between -- tasty funny robustly acted -- more than compensates.It helps having strong actors fully invested in their expositional blather. On the planet Asgard King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and queen Frigga (Rene Russo barely verbal) must choose an heir to the throne. Odins options come down to son one Thor a hot-tempered pinup played by Chris Hemsworth and his undermining brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston looking like Shakespeares Iago). Thors impetuous streak leads his posse into battle with the Frost Giants from the neighboring planet Jotunheim pronounced ""Vodenheim"" which sounds like a classy Norwegian writers retreat but is in fact a cold and forbidding place much like the University of Minnesotas Duluth campus.Banished for his bloodthirsty actions Thor and his mighty hammer are whooshed to New Mexico where the more engaging half of ""Thor"" unfolds. Astrophysics research team members played by Natalie Portman Stellan Skarsgard and Kat ""Just Gliding Through"" Dennings have their eyes on the skies when down comes this hunk of hero. Hes a space-Norse fish out of water in need of a comeuppance before he can become a true hero. In one choice bit he charges into a pet store unsuccessfully demanding a horse. (The screenplay starts with Thors arrival and then flashes back to Asgard and Jotunheim.)As with the first ""Iron Man"" its the humor that seals the deal not the action. Branaghs strengths clearly lie in the interpersonal scheming and glowering between Thor and crimson-eyed lizard baddie Laufey (Colm Feore) and the sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki a relationship of welcome ambiguity. As Odin Hopkins brings purpose and steel to what could have been a routine assignment. As for the hammer well its a pip It works like a supersonic boomerang and as someone says ""Tis a fit companion for a king."" Hemsworth was a fine pick for this role. Hell be back on screen next summer in the all-star Marvel bash ""The Avengers.""mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence)Cast Chris Hemsworth (Thor); Natalie Portman (Jane); Tom Hiddleston (Loki); Stellan Skarsgard (Dr. Selvig); Kat Dennings (Darcy); Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson); Colm Feore (Laufey); Idris Elba (Heimdall); Anthony Hopkins (Odin); Rene Russo (Frigga); Jaimie Alexander (Sif)Credits Directed by Kenneth Branagh; written by Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne; produced by Kevin Feige.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Some of the best moments in Thor an adaptation of a long-running Marvel Comics character dont spotlight its heros abilities as a hammer-slinging battle-loving monster-fighting Norse god. They come from Natalie Portman who co-stars as an astrophysicist who discovers Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in the middle of the New Mexico desert. The film establishes her as a hard-driving fiercely committed professional using the usual shorthand but the way she melts into a stammering smitten girlish mess in Hemsworths presence is all her own. Its not hard to see where her characters coming from though. In a star-making turn Hemsworth plays Thor as an uncomplicated man of action with the moral clarity and love of derring-do of a 40s swashbuckler and the toned physique of a 21st-century underwear model. Hes also the embodiment of the big loud relentlessly entertaining film around him the sort that should remind moviegoers why they used to get so excited about comic-book movies in the first place. Directed by Kenneth Branagh whos never managed a film this big before and acquits himself well Thor divides its time between Earth and Asgard the realm of the gods and a hotbed of palace intrigue. Though unhappy when Odin (Anthony Hopkins) passes him over as heir to the throne Hemsworths brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) joins him and a handful of other deities as they raid the realm of some frost giants after they break an uneasy peace with the Asgardians. Exiled to Earth by an unhappy Hopkins Hemsworth finds himself confused by modern life. But not that confused. The way he simply goes about his godly heroic business provides the film with its best running gag That too is something like the movie around him. Whether on Earth or in the high fantasy world of Asgard--rendered here as something like a Frank Frazetta reimagining of the Death Star--Thor keeps charging forward with its head down. If its many action scenes werent so exciting or its characters less charming it might seem businesslike just another part of Marvels continuing attempts to build the film equivalent of its comic-book universe. Like other films from that effort--the two Iron Man movies and 2008s The Incredible Hulk--it does spend some time attending to that agenda but its a film with its own identity the simple thrilling story of a handsome god who falls to Earth and reminds everyone what heroes do.

Its the bridge. Theres the kaleidoscopic Rainbow Bridge connecting the Norse gods home Asgard to the other Eight Realms. Theres the interdimensional wormhole studied by a lovely astrophysicist in Puente Antiguo (""old bridge"") N.M. There are the parallel plots connecting two families under siege and the bond between old legends and comic books. And theres the film itself a gateway to 2013s multi- hero mashup ""The Avengers."" Happily ""Thor"" feels specific and complete less an obligatory link in a continuing tale than a handsomely engineered hugely enjoyable standalone. Despite the weight of antique myth piled atop it director Kenneth Branagh gives the film an agile buzzing vitality. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor the temperamental son of supreme ruler Odin (a majestic Anthony Hopkins) and brother to Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who thinks often deviously before he acts. The long truce between the Frost Giants and the gods wobbles when several titans invade Asgard to reclaim their power source held by Odin as spoils of war. Hotheaded Thor escalates the conflict with a rogue reprisal attack. In its aftermath he further angers Odin. (Never tell a god ""You are an old man and a fool"") Banished to present-day Earth to wander the desert stripped of his powers and his hammer Thor is sideswiped by a speeding van. Inside are scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) her mentor Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) and wry sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings) whose squabbles are a funhouse reflection of the gods discord. A Viking walks into a diner THOR  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sci-fi action and violence. For much of the film Hemsworth is both hero and comic relief. He doesnt walk he strides. He doesnt speak he proclaims. With vainglorious Viking swagger Thor smashes his coffee mug in a diner bellowing ""Bring me another"" His clashes are more dramatic and bruising with agents of SHIELD. The spy agency has confiscated Janes research and cordoned off the impact crater around Mjolnir now immovably fused to a boulder. Thors one-man assault on the heavily guarded complex is a textbook example of kick-butt action moviemaking. Meanwhile back in Norseland Loki maneuvers closer to Odins throne. Branagh a Shakespearean quite at home with warring dynasties and high-flown dialogue directs the piece with agile intelligence. When spectacle is called for he pulls out all the stops. Asgards golden towers make oil emirates skyscrapers look like Tinkertoys. Theres a great new movie monster in the Destroyer a giant flame-throwing suit of armor. The battle scenes -- its hammer time -- surpass the thunderous war sequences in Branaghs film of ""Henry V."" The films dazzle is in the details however. Every character is rounded and shaded every scene is performed to the smallest nuance. Hiddleston is charismatic and persuasive as the nominal villain scarcely more flawed than his brother. Loki is no megalomaniac but a creature of misguided deeply human motives. Hemsworth and Portman are fine separately and delightful together bringing a light touch to their flirtation. Even beneath layers of costuming and makeup Idris Elba exudes watchful gravitas as Asgards gatekeeper and Colm Feore is a fittingly cool adversary as the Frost Giants king. ""Thor"" bridges the gap between high culture and low between fanboys and mass moviegoers. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Thor Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie Review ThorKenneth Branagh presides over a mishmash of superhero and Shakespearean elements.May 06 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Chris Hemsworth stars in ""Thor."" (Marvel Studios )Think of ""Thor"" as the ultimate Superhero Smackdown. In one corner is the canny Kenny B. a.k.a. Kenneth Branagh a director still best known for superior Shakespearean productions like ""Henry V"" ""Hamlet"" and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" a man not usually associated with comic book adaptations. In the other corner are the mighty monarchs of Marvel Entertainment a well-oiled mass entertainment machine boasting ownership of more than 8000 comic book characters and more than 6.1 billion in worldwide box office grosses. So how did the match turn out? Was Kenny B. sucker-punched and steam-rollered by the commercial demands of the Marvel mastodons or did the crafty creator bring a touch of class to Marvels story set amid the all-powerful gods and goddesses of Norse mythology? Believe it or not all this commotion ends in a draw. For despite all the hype despite the 150-million budget despite a post-shooting 3-D conversion despite stars like Oscar winners Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins and hunky young Australian Chris Hemsworth as the God of Thunder himself what we have here is an aesthetic standoff between predictable elements and unexpected ones. ""Thor"" has its strengths but it is finally something of a mishmash with designs on being more interesting than it manages to be. Part of ""Thors"" artistic confusion and lack of unity can be attributed to its having not only two different settings but two completely different tones which in turn may be partly because of it having no fewer than five credited writers (screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller amp; Zack Stentz and Don Payne story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich). The first setting is the fictional town of Puente Antiguo N.M. where feisty astrophysicist Jane Foster (Portman) and a pair of scientific colleagues (Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings) are tracking some wacky atmospheric phenomenon in the nighttime desert sky when Jane accidentally whacks Thor with her pickup truck. ""Do me a favor"" Jane says to the man on the ground ""and dont be dead."" Talk about your cute meets. To explain how the Norse God of Thunder ended up disoriented in the American desert the film takes us for an extended interlude to the magical world of Asgard home of Thor his father King Odin (Hopkins) and Thors clever brother Loki (fine young British actor Tom Hiddleston). Though he is the heir to Odins throne Thor on his home turf is revealed to be a violence-prone warrior with serious anger management problems. When Asgards traditional enemies the tall and troublesome Frost Giants cause difficulty Thor is all for teaching them and their malevolent King Laufey (Colm Feore) a lesson they wont forget. This does not work out as planned and the big guy and his mighty hammer Mjolnir end up banished to Earth where Thor no longer has special powers and has to walk around saying things like ""I need sustenance"" when he gets hungry. Anchored by a solid performance by Hopkins who has said the story energized him the Asgard sections are ""Thors"" most substantial with Branagh likely having had something Shakespearean in mind with his portrayal of the conflict between an unbending father and his headstrong son. Back on Earth the plot is not in such good shape with every derivative thing that happens to the scientists investigating Thor playing like it happened better in another movie. Sidekicks Skarsgard and Dennings are not impressive and Portman who goes all giggly at the sight of Thors admittedly impressive body is not going to be winning a second Oscar for this role. Only Hemsworth displaying a playful sense of humor flourishes. ""Thors"" extensive special effects are also a mixed bag. Some elements like the Rainbow Bridge that leads to the ""Beam me up Scotty"" machinery that connects Asgard and Earth are fun while other shots of Asgard make it look like Apples futurist 1984 Super Bowl ad on steroids. This random quality extends to a lot of the movie. For every weak element like a generic killer robot called the Destroyer there is a strong one like ""The Wires"" Idris Elba a long way from Stringer Bell and the mean streets of Baltimore effectively playing the all-seeing gatekeeper Heimdall. One aspect of ""Thor"" that touches a sore spot is the recurrence of Marvels awkward and greedy attempts to build audience and pound the drum for future films like ""The Avengers"" (Marvels upcoming movie that will unite many of its marquee characters) by linking its superheroes to the mysterious crime fighters of S.H.I.E.L.D. One of their operatives has a part in the film and there is the by-now obligatory clip of random S.H.I.E.L.D. footage after the credits. ""The Avengers"" doesnt come out for a year and Im already feeling overhyped. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Thor MPAA rating PG-13 for scenes of intense sci-fi action and violence Running time 2 hours 10 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSeven lessons from Thor The Dark Worlds box-office...November 11 2013Review Thor The Dark World hammered by repetitionNovember 6 2013Movie review In The Avengers a Marvel-ous teamMay 3 2012Capsule movie reviewsMay 6 2011A ripe season of celluloidMay 1 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesThorEntertainmentKat DenningsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-thor-20110506,0,7805780.story?track=rss",200,thor25,thor,latimes

Zade Rosenthal In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Chris Hemsworth left and Natalie Portman are shown in a scene from the film ""Thor."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures-Marvel Studios Zade Rosenthal) In ancient times hundreds of years before the dawn of history there lived a race of gods in a realm called Asgard. No one knows who they were or what they were doing but their legacy remains hewn in the living rock of a middling movie called ""Thor.""With its references to other properties in the Marvel universe and to classic tales of redemption this no-surprises summer movie might appeal to those whove been bitten by radioactive spiders or the Shakespeare bug. It was dutifully directed by Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V"") whos proved he can handle epic conflicts if not CGI effects and kitsch comedy.The epic conflict here is between a noble father and a headstrong son. In mythic Oz-like Asgard crown prince Thor (Chris Hemsworth a smirking beefcake cousin of Tom Cruise and Chris Pine) is tricked by his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) into breaching the peace with the Frost Giants. Thors father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) banishes Thor to Earth and names Loki as his successor. Thor crash-lands near a retro Route 66 town in New Mexico where the high-falutin hunk is befriended by physicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman who plays the presumably brilliant scientist as a smitten ninny).A giant killer robot is close behind. Thor can only regain his powers if he can pull his mighty hammer from a crater thats surrounded by Feds led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). And he can only free the hammer if he learns to love others more than himself. So while Jane helps Thor get in touch with his sensitive side a rainbow coalition of cohorts arrives from Asgard to help with the smiting. Some of the bloodless CGI action sequences are humongous but as usual in these blockbusters the 3-D darkens the image and adds little of value while countless product placements clamor for our attention. The ultimate product placement is the inevitable end-credit tease for ""The Avengers"" the upcoming movie in which Thor will join Iron Man and the Marvelettes to battle the gravest threat of all our boredom.""Thor""Two and a half stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 154  Content Intense battle sequences Videos Watch a trailer for Thor May 5 2011 (...)

This pre-summer 3-D action entry devoted to Marvels hammer-wielding Dude of Thunder is a mere pit stop on the road to the ""Avengers film to be released in May 2012. The new movie comes after ""The Hulk and the two ""Iron Man movies and precedes ""Captain America (due this July) and believe me you have never experienced a more anal-retentive rollout of a beloved entertainment franchise. Each of the proto-""Avengers movies ends with a post-credits teaser scene that advances the meta-narrative; the one in ""Thor had the fan-guy sitting next to me reeling in shock. As a nonbeliever Im just antsy for the main event already. Some of us do have lives.For a holding maneuver ""Thor itself turns out to be diverting enough -- not close to a sharp-edged romp like ""Iron Man but not the B-movie roadshow some of us were expecting. Call it a B+ movie. (On a side note the movie was shot in 3-D but you can barely tell even in the Asgard scenes that are meant to suggest vast CGI distances. This isnt bad 3-D just completely unnecessary. If you want to save money and stick with the flat version you wont miss a thing.) The films chief weakness is that star Chris Hemsworth isnt Robert Downey Jr. in quickness or charisma but that really wont matter to the films primary constituencies young boys older fan-boys and women.As to the latter not for nothing does the film see its Norse demigod hero through the eyes of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) the plucky astrophysicist who happens to be standing by in the desert when Thor crashes over from the parallel-realm of Asgard. (The preferred mode of travel for Norse demigods by the way is tornado. Dont expect this movie to play well in Alabama for quite some time.) In one early scene the hero removes his shirt to reveal the torso of an Aryan Chippendales dancer and its played as a Taylor Lautner moment for older gals Portmans Jane goes quietly gooey as does her sardonic intern (Kat Dennings as a sort of Facebook-era Eve Arden) as did a vocal contingent of the women at the screening I attended.Fine; they deserve some beefcake after years of putting up with ""Spider-Man and ""The Hulk. Hemsworths Thor is annoyingly arrogant in the initial scenes before his one-eyed daddy Odin (Anthony Hopkins rumbling discreetly in search of a paycheck) exiles him to Earth for trying to jumpstart a war with the evil Frost Giants. Once hes humbled (and after some amusing scenes of him bulldozing through small-town diners in search of mead) the star lightens up and is good company for the duration.A good thing too since ""Thor is loaded down with sub-Wagnerian huggermugger. The films designated menace the Norse trickster (and Thors brother) Loki is played by the weedy British actor Tim Hiddleston as a passive-aggressive bad guy -- its a portrait of the super-villain as a young man. Thor also has four knightly sidekicks who are plotting to return him to Asgard including the Falstaffian Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) the Robin Hoodish Fandral (Josh Dallas) the Amazonian Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano of the 2001 cult classic ""Ichi the Killer) a samurai who appears to have taken a left turn at the Tokugawa Shogunate.Toss in the Frost King (Colm Feore) Thors mum (Rene Russo) and Idris Elba looking like a ""Tron extra as the Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge and youve got one crowded dance floor in Asgard. Nor is Earth much better with Stellan Skarsgard as Janes scientific mentor (and the only actual Norseman anywhere near this movie) Clark Gregg returning from ""Iron Man as the imperturbably bland agent from SHIELD and a neat little cameo by Jeremy Renner as an operative with serious archery skills. (And there are the Marvel elves again rolling in another piece of ""Avengers furniture.)Given this rugby scrum its surprising that ""Thor moves along at a fairly brisk clip entertaining us while never getting us to believe any of it matters the least. Also surprising is the director Kenneth Branagh. But maybe not so surprising since the actor-directors experience with Shakespeare allows him to spin this movies tin-eared comic-book dialogue with the right amount of ersatz nobility. ""Thor shows the Marvel movie formula -- amp up the laughs deploy stars smartly protect the franchise at all costs -- at its most obvious and efficient. It gives mediocre a good name.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Thor review Kenneth Branagh directs a superhero movie as thunderous as its subject |       NJ.com comments Thor review Kenneth Branagh directs a superhero movie as thunderous as its subject Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 05 2011 at 1002 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1048 AM View/Post Comments Zade Rosenthal/Marvel StudiosAustralian import Chris Hemsworth stars as Thor the latest Marvel superhero to pop up on the big screen. Norse god sent to live and fight evil on Earth. He is the god who fell to earth. A son of Odin who angered his father with his arrogance and impulsiveness. A prince of thunder who was cast out of his Norse paradise and sent to Earth to learn humility. And you could read it all in Marvel Comics Journey Into Mystery No. 83 on newsstands in August 1962. ""Thor"" has his own movie now and its both about time and a pleasant change. The superheroes weve been getting lately are all either mutants (Spidey the Hulk and all those X-people) or guys with really great workshops (Batman Iron Man). Thor on the other hand is a supernormal royal straight out of mythology. He rules literally. But hes still got the same problems (family troubles girlfriend drama) as any Marvel character. And the same careless tendency to bust a city to smithereens while ostensibly saving it. Movie Review Thor (PG-13) Paramount (114 min.) Directed by Kenneth Branagh. With Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and alcohol abuse Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS Like its hero ""Thor"" the movie (which hews closer to more recent comics than the classic 60s issues) has a foot in two worlds. Half the movie takes place in Asgard the gods home. Half takes place on Earth which Thor is eager to leave. On Asgard director Kenneth Branagh leans toward the cosmic with lots of rainbow bridges and crystal palaces. On earth things are a bit more comic with Thor stomping around like a Viking in a china shop. Both are overplayed just a bit (with the CGI heaven looking an awful lot like a bad 70s album cover). But Branagh plugs right into the epic family dynamics -- in some ways Thor is just another Prince Hal trying to prove himself worthy of the throne -- and the films many hand-to-hand battles are shot clearly and convincingly. Branagh also has the advantage of a good cast. Anthony Hopkins -- in another paycheck part but one hes earning -- is Odin Thors demanding one-eyed dad. Natalie Portman is Jane Foster the cute astrophysicist the god favors on Earth. (Shes a bit bland but smartly the movie adds Kat Denning for additional quirk.) Thor meanwhile is Chris Hemsworth a gentle hunk and an Aussie import. (Have we totally forgotten how to grow actors like this here?) He has a properly regal air and if in his Viking breastplate he looks a bit like Heath Ledger in ""A Knights Tale"" the folks who have done up the movies posters clearly dont seem to mind. ""Thor"" is not as consistently entertaining as the first ""Spider-Man"" or ""Iron Man"" (or as outside-the-box as ""The Dark Knight"" or Tim Burtons ""Batman""). Theres also more than the usual touch of p.c. casting (Idris Elba as one of the Norse immortals? Really?) But even if nothing here is ground-breaking Hemsworth is good the father/son conflict plays well and the giant Destroyer automaton -- a kind of walking stalking oil furnace -- that Thor eventually faces down is decidedly cool. All in all its a good official start to the summer season -- and for a movie superhero counting down the days until he joins the all-star ""The Avengers.""

Spider-Man and its two sequels plus both Iron Man movies and the Wolverine prequel have all kick-started the summer movie season in burly style. Now its Thors turn. The Norse god -- first Marvelized in a 1962 comic book -- introduces what is conceived as a zillion-part movie series about the Avengers team of Marvel stalwarts. Captain America impersonated by Chris Evans gets his own starring chapter in July; another Avenger the James Bondian Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) comes next year. Like its namesake Thor is big blond-bland handsomely put together and a little musclebound. Played by an Aussie Adonis named Chris Hemsworth whose looks and demeanor suggest a young airbrushed Nick Nolte Thor sports a permanent scowl -- perhaps because in the alternate universe of the movie business he had his oh thunder stolen by the carjackers of Fast Five which jumped the traditional opening date of the Hollywood blockbuster season by a week and proved a popular smash. So this weekend Thor faces two daunting challenges to vanquish his enemies in mythological Norway and modern-day New Mexico and to top Fast Fives 86.2-million box-office haul. Early on that seems an impossible task given the heavy weather of the first part of the film. Set in the mists of ancient Asgard -- the home of Thor his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and their regal dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) -- these scenes are as starchy and stentorian as the cloudland sequences in superhero films of old. Great actors (Marlon Brando as Jor-El in the 1978 Superman Laurence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 Clash of the Titans) tend to go fruity when slumming as fantasy-film deities and Hopkins nearly surrenders to that campy impulse. The drama flirts so flagrantly with self-parody that one half-expects the actors to burst into their own Mel Brooks lampoon with Hopkins spritzing ""I just disowned my son and heir and boy is he Thor."" Given that Thor is a gigantic surfer-god and Loki slim and black-clad the films platoon of writers (eight are credited) might have gone the familiar Marvel route of turning the malcontent into a troubled hero a la Peter Parker. But they stick to the Aryan tradition of blond as beautiful and dark as malevolent. The early sequences are also clotted with confounding backstory dialogue -- like Thors ""Have you forgotten all weve done together?"" -- that will have non-Marvelettes thinking theyve wandered into the middle of another movie. Lets see a cold land frosty mytho-creatures icy art direction a woozily pompous atmosphere -- could this be an unwished-for sequel to The Last Airbender? Then you recall that the director is Kenneth Branagh the actor-director who a quarter-century ago was called the next Olivier -- a prophesy that became an albatross. Like Lord Larry he starred in and directed films of Henry V and Hamlet but he lacked Oliviers divine fire; he was more a clever manager than a matinee idol. Between Shakespeares (he also brought Much Ado About Nothing Loves Labors Lost and As You Like It to the screen) Branagh directed a morose version of Frankenstein in which he played the scientist to Robert De Niros Creature and a remake of the murder thriller Sleuth which after much judicious consideration I can call the worst movie of the current millennium. What could he bring to a Marvel comic movie that Spider-Mans Sam Raimi or Iron Mans Jon Favreau couldnt? Turns out Branagh has a deft touch after all; he just waits for the modern scenes to reveal it. Evicted from Asgard Thor lands in the New Mexico desert getting promptly creamed by astrophysicist and reckless driver Jane Foster (Natalie Portman in her sixth film released in six months) and tased by her comic sidekick Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). A displaced superhero stranded on Earth where his special gifts are initially inappropriate Thor acquires some of the clumsy charm of Jeff Bridges interstellar traveler in Starman. The heroic bluster that seemed stilted in Asgard plays as engaging comedy when Thor is confined in a hospital and demands ""How dare you attack the son of Odin"" Clearly the dude has muscle-management issues. As Jane advises him ""Dont smash things."" An action movie is obliged to smash things just as an action hero has to face outsize adversaries. So Thor contains its share of fights which are well-staged if video-gamey and a climactic showdown with a lantern-headed iron giant sent to Earth by Loki. But the central pleasures are in the smaller scenes. The picture finds the right light tone when puny humans as if in a carnival strength game attempt to pull Thors hammer from the rock where its embedded -- the Arthurian sword in the stone transported to the American Southwest. And Branagh brings a tactful warmth to the budding relationship of Thor and Jane. Of the power he learns to harness in his new terrestrial home he tells her ""Your ancestors called it magic but you call it science. I come from a land where they are one and the same."" At its best moments Thor weaves a spot of magic from the complex science of 150-million fantasy-film technology. Marvel completists will welcome the return of S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) who popped up in the Iron Man films. And Thor wouldnt be an official part of the Avengers canon without a visit from Jacksons Nick Fury already the most advance-promod character in movie history He doesnt get his own self-named film until summer 2012 but he showed up in both Iron Man films and will materialize again in this Julys Captain America. I believe Fury was also spotted last weekend at the royal wedding and the White House Correspondents dinner and he may have been part of the Seal Team Six that took down bin Laden. But well have to wait for the movie version to be sure. The true god of the project is Stan Lee who went to work at Marvel (then known as Timely Publications) an astounding 72 years ago filling inkwells for the artists and soon graduating to writer editor and chief mythmaker. He and his artists dreamed up Spider-Man Iron Man Thor Fury and the rest of the Avengers team in the space of one year 1962. Looking spry for 88 Lee has a one-line cameo in the latest film to spring from his lightning-bolt brain. ""Did it work?"" he asks about I-forget-what. The answer After a rough start and when it comes down to Earth Thor works pretty well.

(Zade Rosenthal) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 5 2011 400 AM Title Thor A Norse god becomes a superhero. With Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins. Director Kenneth Branagh. (155) PG-13 Comic-book violence. At area theaters; in 3-D and Imax where available. Dont miss Thor and his cohorts horse ride across the Rainbow Bridge to battle nasty Frost Giants. Once more unto the breach blockbuster fans for this summers first superhero epic ""Thor."" Verily though theres a snag No matter how the filmmakers move Heaven and Earth this comic-book adaptation looks cool but contains very little thunder. The fault is a script by a five-headed beast which contains fateful missteps. And while star Chris Hemsworth looks right -- half Brawny paper towel man half towel-snapping NFL superstar -- and the effects soon improve on a godly realm resembling the disco-era look of ""Flash Gordon"" this is a tough title to translate. The upside is ""Captain America"" due in July may seem refreshingly simple. As for Thor his origin is anything but. A prince among an alien race worshipped as deities by Nordic civilizations he is a vainglorious warrior cast out of a sky-land called Asgard by his angry father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). This delights Thors deceitful stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who covets the throne for himself. Landing on Earth Thor has no powers and his magic hammer is stuck in mud until he learns humility and kindness. He acquires both thanks to a cute astrophysicist (Natalie Portman) and a few pints at a pub with her boss (Stellan Skarsgard). With his hammer back Thor returns to Asgard to find Loki in charge and Odin close to death. Director Kenneth Branagh a smart choice helps emphasize the semi-Shakespearean family drama but has to fight a war on two fronts. First he must wrestle with the mumbo-jumbo required to give the character context (and become part of next years superteam film ""The Avengers"" -- theres a post-credits look at that adventures crucial element). Then he has to deal with Earth. But were trapped too long amongst the pinball-machine sets; Thor discovering humanity is intriguing but its given short shrift so Branagh relies on Hemsworths Viking smile and Portmans valedictorian perkiness to sell it. No real threat emerges beyond a Gort-like giant robot ordered to ""destroy everything"" but which cant get past a New Mexico shantytown. Thors warrior pals appear briefly to help him then have nothing to do. And while Hiddleston has a good glower Lokis malevolence proves a snooze. It is of course too much to ask that every warm-weather costume-hero saga be as good as ""Iron Man"" a guy Thor will meet in 2012. But aside from a few grace notes this one is not a dish fit for the gods. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Thor (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Thor (PG-13) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com 5/4/2011 How did they manage to make such a fun sprightly engaging movie out of Thor? The venerable hammer-swinging character -- the Norse God of Thunder Son of Asgard largely humorless superman -- was one of the least likely of all the characters in the Marvel Comics universe to anchor a live-action feature film. There is so much back story and set-up to plod through -- stuff about alternate universes and realms and wars between worlds that have nothing to do with ours -- that the material would seem too heavy and lugubrious for a movie.Well think again. Screenwriters Ashley Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne have come up with a brilliant way around one of the series central problems The comic books spent large chunks of time in Asgard where gods bickered and plotted against each other and then several months worth of issues on Earth where Thor battled evil demigods and the occasional garden-variety super-villain. The movie constantly cuts back and forth between the realms while telling its story The young and arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of his powers and magical hammer and sentenced to live as a mortal on Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) while Thors younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) one of the most cunning and treacherous of Marvels villains plots to bump off the old man and make himself king of Asgard. Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh ( Hamlet Henry V) who initially seemed like an odd choice for this sort of material until you see the film and realize what a perfect choice he was. A lot of Asgard with its rainbow bridges and golden spires looks like the cover of a vintage Yes album and having people running around shouting things such as ""O Father We must speak to you urgently"" could have easily deteriorated into camp. But Branagh uses his Shakespearean roots to invest the Asgard sequences with gravitas and suspense and a genuine sense of tragedy. This is in essence the story of an aging king who must choose which of his sons will succeed him and Branagh proves he knows how to turn this familiar formula into absorbing invigorating entertainment even with the addition of red-eyed frost giants and giant robots with laser beams that vaporize anything they touch.The Asgard sequences are great fun but the stuff on Earth is even better as Thor tries to make sense of his surroundings befriends a scientist (Natalie Portman) who wants to help him and kiss him in equal measure and tries to figure out a way to get back to Asgard. Played by Hemsworth with a tremendous amount of charisma and charm Thor is the rare superhero who spends the bulk of his movie without any special abilities so you grow to like the character for who he is not for what he can do. When he finally gets his hammer back and is able to swing into action Thor takes off like a rocket propelled by a level of excitement uncommon in most comic-book superhero adaptations. If you have any interest in the Avengers movie Thor is required viewing since there are things that happen here which will have grave repercussions in that hugely anticipated epic. But there is nothing in this surprisingly funny exciting film that feels like homework and Branagh even dares to end the film on if not quite a cliffhanger then a daring ""To Be Continued"" note. The summer movie season officially kicks off with a thunderstorm of the best kind.

Michael Straczynski Jack Kirby Stan Lee Larry Lieber Ashley Miller Don Payne Mark Protosevich Zack Stentz; Release Date Wide 05/06/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 130; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted July 28 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Can a blockbuster be momentous and lighthearted at the same time? Thor Kenneth Branaghs rousing popcorn adventure about the Norse-blond hammer-wielding god of thunder who made his Marvel Comics debut in 1962 pulls off something I wouldnt have thought possible It restores the innocence to big-budget superhero mythmaking. Thor played by the Australian newcomer Chris Hemsworth with a bulked-up swagger absurdly noble eyes and a killer grin is a stud-muffin Viking Hercules who is born to royalty in the realm of ? Asgard. After crossing his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in a fit of youthful pique he gets stripped of his powers and is sent through a wormhole which crash-lands him in the New Mexico desert. On Earth Thor is rescued by a team of scientists (led by Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgdrd) and he is almost childlike in his ability to cause trouble without trying. He speaks in incongruously formal Kings English (""I need sustenance""). Yet the movie though its often a very funny god-out-of-water origin comedy has a stirring emotional core as well. It keeps returning to Asgard where Branagh stages the political-familial infighting -- centered on Thors treacherous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) -- like an intergalactic Gladiator. The director also proves an unexpected maestro of digital effects (a crystal bridge a race of scaly blue gargoyles who can turn anyone they touch into ice). On our planet the film doesnt have much of a plot Thor must retrieve his weighty hammer (the focus of a government security crackdown) and he does battle with a grand fire-shooting metal monster. Yet Thor turns its heros confusion -- about who he is where he belongs and why he has these..feelings for Portmans feisty Jane Foster -- into touchingly overscaled coming-of-age kicks. Its not art but its mighty fun. A?

Thor Good Director Kenneth Branagh. Cast Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Anthony Hopkins Tom Hiddleston. Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action. This weeks new releases Movies based on comic books Superheroes we love Off with their shirts But humor is the most powerful weapon deployed by director Kenneth Branagh in ""Thor"" his rollicking take on the comic. We get some scheming and fighting among the gods between gods and other supernatural beings and between humans gods and scariest of all shadowy government agencies. But Branagh and his cast wisely deliver all this with a wink and a nod - and huge eardrum-shattering explosions. In short ""Thor"" is great summer fun. Branagh talks Thor | Chris Hemsworth The film begins in the middle of nowhere in New Mexico where beautiful scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) along with fellow scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and mascot/assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are scanning the night sky for activity. Boy do they get it. Lights and clouds and dust lead to wild driving and with their truck hitting a man who turns out to be our hero played by the muscular Chris Hemsworth. Instead of a heros welcome however Thor is treated to doubts and a belief that hes a lunatic. Darcy also Tases him for his trouble. This leads to a backstory in which we learn that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thors father rules Asgard one of the realms of the universe. Odin has fought to a messy peace with the frost giants of Jotunheim. Hes getting on in age so the time has come to pass his throne to one of his sons Thor or Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor is his pick but he proves rash impulsive and quick to fight. One thing leads to another and after a reckless disastrous attack on Jotunheim Odin banishes Thor to Earth before he inherits the crown. Thus Jane Foster hit by truck Tased etc. It all plays out much more entertainingly than that sounds. And then the fun really begins. Thor has been stripped of his godlike trappings including his trusty hammer Mjolnir which also falls to Earth and lands stuck in a piece of rock. The locals maybe dreaming of being low-rent would-be King Arthurs make a sport of trying to remove it until Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) last seen in the ""Iron Man"" movies shows up with his government team and takes over everything. Its funny to watch Thor navigate Earth as a god without powers (although he retains an otherworldly appetite) and to see Jane and her crews reaction to him. But theres a spark between Jane and Thor one that worries Selvig - Thor is after all a nut case for all they know. Events will prove otherwise. Fans of the comic may notice some deviation from the origin story but if thats going to prevent you from enjoying this you might be taking things a little too seriously. The character development what there is of it occurs in a flash as fleeting as lightning from Asgard. But you dont go to ""Thor"" looking for Shakespeare even if Branagh is directing. His skill in that regard is evident however in the performances. Hemsworth is a good sport playing his buffed-up appearance for laughs. He comes off as a genuinely good guy; his Earth-bound Thor is a guy youd want to have a beer with - and a guy youd want to have your back if you had too many. (A great throwaway comes when he shows up at Janes trailer with Selvig slung over his shoulder. What happened she asks? ""We drank. We fought. He did his ancestors proud."") Portman doesnt have a lot to do but shes fine. Hopkins is commanding which is nice because he isnt always (though it seems to be his choice when to be). Best of all is Hiddleston as the complex Loki who is more than he seems to be even in this context. The battle scenes are a little muddled - 3-D doesnt help this - and the various realms are sometimes striking sometimes hokey. But no matter. Branagh is out for fun and he finds it in large doses. With the ""Iron Man"" movies ""The Incredible Hulk"" and now this Marvel is making a nice name for itself in the movie business. Bring on ""The Avengers.""

With its big hair bulging biceps blunt dialogue swooning maidens stoic heroes shiny sets and even shinier armour had Thor been released a quarter of a century ago it would have had its own animated spinoff tie-in shampoo and a range of articulated toys manufactured by Kenner. Even the basic set-up - an age-old interglactic conflict between musclebound lugs transfers to Earth and chaos ensues - feels eerily similar to the movie version of Masters of the Universe. The only thing missing is a cheeky animal sidekick.Comic-book fans will angrily point out that this incarnation of the ancient Norse god was actually created by Marvel guru and cameo junkie Stan Lee back in the early 60s and that the films plot which sees Thor (Chris Hemsworth) banished from Asgard by his dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in an effort to teach the wayward warrior a spot of humility comes directly from the source. But its clear from the decor the dialogue and the nod-and-wink execution that everyone involved knows exactly how outrageously outdated this all is and theyre going to have a little fun with it while they can.Not that Thor is camp - this isnt Flash Gordon 2 however much some of us might have enjoyed that. Like a number of recent comic-book blockbusters it treads the line between telling an engaging story and recognising its silliness though it does err sporadically on both sides. For every solid action set-piece or inventive digital effect theres a ludicrous costume choice or stupid sub-Shakespearian plot twist pity poor Tom Hiddleston whose role as hissable trickster Loki is little more than a daft horned helmet and a dismissive sneer.The supporting cast fare better while Hemsworth pouts Hopkins barks and Natalie Portman simpers as forgettable love interest Jane Foster its Stellan Skarsgaard and Kat Dennings as Portmans scientist sidekicks who emerge with dignity relatively intact. Hackneys own Idris Elba also does himself proud as taciturn gatekeeper Heimdall but the less said about Thors roving pack of becoiffed back-up gods the better.But the big question which hangs over Thor and one which is never satisfactorily explained is why Kenneth Branagh? Hes never shown a penchant for action and that isnt remedied here while the films many noisy punchups are perfectly serviceable this is a largely anonymous piece of work lacking any directorial stamp. And this apparent dispassion extends to the figures on screen with precious little attention paid to character development.But for anyone looking for a spot of mindless holiday fluff Thor remains an endearing throwback to simpler times when men were men gods were gods and heroes looked like bodybuilders whod just raided the dress-up box. Just dont expect to remember much about it afterwards.

Natalie Portman is an example for tiny women everywhere... My only complaint about it is that it could have been a bit longer and that might have allowed for more development of more minor characters (maybe?). But theres so much to enjoy about this film Id recommend it its exciting and fun and sweet and spectacular.

My only complaint about it is that it could have been a bit longer and that might have allowed for more development of more minor characters (maybe?). But theres so much to enjoy about this film Id recommend it its exciting and fun and sweet and spectacular.

TWITTER Chris Hemsworth gives a breakout performance as fallen Norse god Thor in Marvels summer blockbuster which co-stars Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins. SYDNEY -- The Marvel universe moves into the cosmic realm with the 3D Thor a burly slab of bombastic superhero entertainment that skitters just this side of kitschy to provide an introduction befitting the mighty god of thunder. Its a noisy universe-rattling spectacle full of sound and fury with a suitably epic design solid digital effects and a healthy respect for the comic-book lore that turned a mythological Norse god into a founding member of the superhero team known as The Avengers. Following its world premiere in Sydney April 17 Thor opens in various territories before its North American bow May 6. The arrogant warrior Thors great conversion central to the plot is unrealistically lightning-quick and the movies dramatic arc falters amid the constant shifts between earthly and celestial realms. But execs at Marvel Studios gambling heavily on the success of Thor and the upcoming Captain America The First Avenger to set up next summers ensemble behemoth The Avengers can rest easy Youve built it and they will come. They may even bring a date. The ultimate accessibility of Thors fantastical world is due in no small measure to the good-humored direction of Kenneth Branagh a man with a highbrow history who knows his way around an epic tale and a star-making turn from Chris Hemsworth. RELATED Kenneth Branagh on Thor Commercial Gods Will Have to Decide Whether Its a Success As the hammer-wielding protagonist who learns humility among the humans the little-known Aussie soap star (last seen briefly as Captain Kirks father in J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot) shoulders the burden of selling this 150 million entrant into the ever-expanding Marvel franchise. Branagh may convey a lofty intellect to the Shakespearean interplay of feuding fathers and sons and co-stars Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman the actorly gravitas. But the 6-foot-3 Hemsworth adds the winning ingredients bringing a lusty Viking charm to his rumbling Olde English line readings a towering physicality and biceps that look forged in a furnace. Verily he is ripped. Thor crashes into being in a desolate stretch of New Mexico desert his face planted inelegantly against the windscreen of an RV driven by Natalie Portmans storm-chasing scientist Jane Foster. As Jane her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings from Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist along purelyfor comic relief) puzzle over his provenance we whip back in time and space to the floating kingdom of Asgard where Thors father Odin (Hopkins) the ruler of all nine realms fills in decades of back story in voiceover. Its heavy stuff made all the more portentous by Patrick Doyles somewhat overwhelming score and thankfully theres someone of Hopkins caliber to deliver it. Thor is about to inherit the throne from the ailing and aged Odin when an unexpected incursion by the Asgardians longstanding foes the Frost Giants of Jotunheim disrupts the coronation. The mighty god of thunder foe to all demons suddenly does a very good impression of a toddler throwing a tantrum in a supermarket aisle. His hot-tempered recklessness has even more dire consequences though The peace and stability of the universe is threatened. An enraged Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth leaving Thors half-brother Loki next in line to the throne and Thor with the task of proving himself worthy of again wielding his magical hammer Mjolnir. The scenes between the three immortals high in the heavens have an electrifying intensity - Tom Hiddleston as the jealous and snaky Loki handles the intimate scenes with particular aplomb - and the earth-bound scenes cant help but seem flat by comparison. Back in the desert we get some solidly amusing fish-out-of-water antics as the mighty Thor struggles to adapt to his mortality and a world of Facebook and iPods but scriptwriters Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne working from an effective origin story by J. Michael Straczynski  and Mark Protosevich have their eye on a bigger prize. Its the love of a good woman that powers Thors life lesson in humility and humanity and Portmans astrophysicist makes short work of converting Thor; too short some will say but theres much story to cram in here and we havent even gotten to that oddly out-of-place glimpse of Jeremy Renneras The AvengersHawkeye. The action pinballs between Asgard the desolate ice planet of Jotunheim and Earth where a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent from the Iron Manfilms (Clark Gregg) is making it difficult for Thor to retrieve his magic hammer and save the humans and the kingdom of Asgard from the forces that would destroy them. Bo Welch has created some stunning designs with Heimdalls Observatory the celestial portal that connects the various realms a particular triumph. Full-throttle fight scenes and the stunt work overall feel organic although Branaghs over-reliance on slanted angles and an unusual slow-mo sequence are merely distracting.

Neither the star pupil nor the dunce of the Marvel superhero-to-screen class ""Thor"" delivers the goods so long as butt is being kicked and family conflict is playing out in celestial dimensions but is less thrilling during the Norse warrior gods rather brief banishment on Earth. With Aussie hunk Chris Hemsworth impressive in the lead and helmer Kenneth Branagh investing the dramatic passages with a weighty yet never overbearing Shakespearean dimension pic looks sure to reap big B.O. on the strength of its ready-made audience but faces a tougher time attracting viewers for whom this type of fare is the exception rather than the rule. Although the comicbook has been in print since 1962 Thor hasnt scored much more than supporting roles and guest spots in various toons and telepics since. With this in mind scripters Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz and Don Payne have wisely penned an unhurried but engrossing half-hour setup of the lesser-known Marvel character and the three worlds he inhabits. Opening snapshot in New Mexico finds astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) her gal-pal/assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Janes mentor Dr. Erik Sevig (Stellan Skarsgard) investigating a twister-like atmospheric disturbance. In their haste to discover whats come down in the storm their RV knocks down Thor (Hemsworth) a buff and bearded stranger. Bulk of the action in the first couple of reels sets up Thors fall from grace in his homeland Asgard a heavenly realm ruled by his supremely wise but aging father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Just moments away from peacefully ascending the throne ahead of brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thor leaps into an eye-popping interdimensional portal and leads an unauthorized attack on Jotunheim home to their enemies the Frost Giants led by reptile-like Laufey (Colm Feore). Odins punishment Thor is dispatched to Midgard (Earth) with his magical hammer Mjolnir but cannot use the mighty instrument until he overcomes the classic mythological shortcomings of arrogance and impetuosity. Speckled with amusing fish-out-of-water humor as Thor marches around a dusty New Mexico town like hes still in Asgard the story promises much from the attentions of government agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Thors brewing confrontation with the Destroyer a hulking creation that resembles a high-tech suit of armor and shoots fire from its eyes. Hes joined in this endeavor by Asgard warrior pals Sif (Jaimie Alexander) Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) Fandral (Josh Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano). Yet Thors smackdown with the Destroyer is all too brief and anticlimactic when stacked up against the spectacularly rendered rumbles in other dimensions. Though Thors romance with Jane is passable thanks largely to Portmans sterling work in a thinly written role the couple isnt given enough alone time or meaningful dialogue to raise the relationship above the ordinary. Its a different matter in the heavens. Hopkins rises to the occasion with a restrained yet powerful portrayal of a father forced by conscience to deal the bitterest of judgments upon his chosen heir and Hiddleston gives a finely tuned perf as the sibling whose loyalty or otherwise to Thor remains a tantalizing question until deep into proceedings. Almost unrecognizable as the star of Aussie soap ""Home and Away"" in the mid-2000s Hemsworth holds his own in distinguished company and will serve the series well in any sequels and ""The Avengers"" Marvels all-star superhero bash skedded for 2012 release. Given only a handful of lines Rene Russo is under-used as Odins wife Frigga. As the living actor and director most closely associated with Shakespeare Branagh may seem a surprise choice for such material. A childhood reader of the comics he brings a fans enthusiasm and his skill as an actors director to the table here. Fitting Hemsworth out with a classical but never pompous British accent and shooting emotionally charged sequences with elegant simplicity Branagh succeeds in rendering his mythological characters deeply human. While no fatal missteps are taken along Thors path to redemption pic has a slightly choppy feel as if its trying to squeeze an origin tale and at least part of its sequel into a single entity. Most of the material motors along just fine though the editing occasionally seems a bit too hurried in moving from one dimension to the next. An extra reel of Earth-bound story might not have gone astray. Assembled by A-list artisans in non-gimmicky 3D (the first such Marvel superhero entry to utilize the stereo format) ""Thor"" looks great. Production designer Bo Welch costume designer Alexandra Byrne and lenser Haris Zambarloukos present striking visions of Asgard as an otherworldly utopia constructed from gleaming golden materials and bathed in a warm amber glow and Jotunheim as the dank and forbidding lair of the mythical worlds most malevolent outcasts. Effects work is on the money with the suspended glowing Bitfrost gateway from Asgard to other worlds an eye-catching highlight. All other technical credits are thoroughly pro.
