But dont go expecting another happy warm hug of a movie this is much less of a charmer trailing a juicy waft of sourness behind it. Charlize Theron gives her best performance in years; shes properly funny (who knew?) as Mavis Gary a train-wreck who crashes into her hometown to reclaim her high-school sweetheart Buddy (Patrick Wilson). What Buddys happily married? Devoted to his new baby? Like Mavis gives a damn. Shes angry self-obsessed immature stalkerish possibly alcoholic... and were kinda gunning for her.The films writer Cody is one seriously funny woman - and one of Hollywoods most in-demand writers. With Mavis its like shes given life to a less-successful less-together evil alter ego a terrifying what-if. Mavis 37 and divorced is also a writer - of young adult fiction (industry-speak for teen novels). And she displays all the emotional maturity of one of her characters. I cant remember a heroine so triumphantly and spectacularly messy. Back in Mercury Minnesota an old classmate clearly traumatised from their high-school days together spies her across a bar and hisses (almost without realising) psychotic prom queen bitch.Mavis isnt stupid - she can see that Buddy loves his wife but downing another shot of whisky blanks it out. Cody draws her characters with absolute precision. Is Mavis slinking back to have a breakdown? Theres an empty loneliness threatening to swallow her up and that keeps on side even when shes at her meanest. Heres Mavis on Mercury People here are so happy with so little. Its like they dont even care what happens to them. There is a raw honesty here rare in movies and its very funny too - excruciating at times.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Charlize Theron is a special case. Thats a compliment. Since the South African-born model and ballerina-turned-actress won the Oscar for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos shes continued to take roles that challenge more than mollify. Theron relishes the prickly character. And she does them quite well to boot. Take Jason Reitmans bitter pill of a comedy ""Young Adult"" written by ""Juno"" scribe Diablo Cody. Mavis Gary heads to the Minnesota town of Mercury with a a troublesome plan banging around in her head. A ghostwriter for a faltering teen fiction series whos done well in the ""Big City"" -- i.e. Minneapolis -- Mavis returns home intent on winning back a high school beau who is happily married and a new father of a baby girl hes smitten with. Patrick Wilson gives a regular-if-handsome-guy believability to Mavis target Buddy Slade. Hes exhausted and clueless the way a truly committed mate and new parent might be. Elizabeth Reaser is Buddys wife Beth. If she doesnt see Mavis as a threat its not out of naivete. One of the surest things Reitman and Cody nail is the notion that not everyone who stays ""behind"" and looks to be living a contented life has somehow settled. The flip side of course is that not every pretty woman who flees home and finds success has any idea of how to be happy. Dont expect to be coddled by the screenplay. Theres not a lot of digging into Mavis psychology. She drinks too much. Shes oblivious to others social cues. The movies title refers not to her vocation but her arrested development. The movies soul and conscience comes in the rumpled form of former classmate Matt or as Mavis calls him once her dim memory is ignited ""Hate Crimes Guy."" Patton Oswalt (""Big Fan"") cuts a fine figure as a man whose life course was altered by a high school incident. He makes small-batch Bourbon and has collectibles befitting the sensitive geek he is. He lives with his sister who receives Mavis with a deference still shaped by the high-school hierarchies of yore. There are people who still kowtow to the old pecking order -- and those who still bear a grudge. Mavis mission is taken seriously and therefore the movies a bit too pointed to be out-and-out hilarious. Instead laughs come in the details and Reitman and Cody have a sharp sense of the absurd. When a date chats about doing volunteer work in Vietnam Mavis looks bored. When they awake next morning shes wearing a Hello Kitty tee. That Japanese fashion import is the extent of her cross-cultural outreach. Theres little about Mavis that makes for feel-good revelry. Thats an understatement perhaps. Yet Therons work feels true to Mavis malaise -- and often just as sad.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 16 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Director Jason Reitmans three first films - Thank You for Smoking Juno and Up in the Air - established the young Canadian-born director as a spiky satirist of Middle America whether in corridors of power or high school. He takes a step backward in his latest film Young Adult reuniting with Junos screenwriter Diablo Cody in a low-key indie-style comedy that plays precariously close to an unfunny sociopathic case study. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Young Adult"" starring Charlize Theron Movies Young Adult The official trailer video Video Patton Oswalt calls love scene with Theron a nightmare The film is a showcase for Charlize Theron as Mavis Gary a high-school mean girl who at 37 still hasnt grown up. A former small-town prom queen who lives in a messy high-rise in Minneapolis she makes a living ghostwriting a young-adult fiction series Waverly Prep (along the lines of Gossip Girl). With her slouching walk bad-taste scowl and condescending glare Theron plays a familiar type in an unfamiliar gender Shes a deluded narcissist like Bill Murray in What About Bob? or Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy. While dodging editors phone calls Mavis watches a lot of Kardashians on TV power-chugs Diet Coke and keeps a small dog she neglects just like a reality TV star might. One morning Mavis gets a mass e-mail saying that her high-school boyfriend the star quarterback Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) has just had his first baby with his wife. What starts as an annoyance that she complains about to a friend over lunch turns into a full-blown identity crisis. Like the romantic heroine in one of her novels Mavis decides to win back her true love. So she sneaks out of her apartment leaving a stranger in her bed to drive to her hometown of Mercury Minn. and save Buddy from domestic misery. High expectations are followed by a quick deflation. When her former boyfriend is not immediately available Mavis goes to a bar to get drunk where she runs into Matt (sad-sack comedian Patton Oswalt) a chubby disabled geek from her school years. Mavis barely remembers Matt except that he was briefly famous for being maimed by a group of homophobic jocks who thought he was gay. Matt a sardonic misfit who spends his time painting customized action figures sees through Mavis but still revels in the company of the statuesque beauty ""Guys like me are born loving women like you."" While screenwriter Cody still indulges in some pop-culture name-dropping (the unhip small-town folk have an improbable fondness for nineties indie bands) the dialogue is sharp without the sitcom wisecracking that marred Juno. What hasnt improved is Codys sense of structure or plausible character motivation. The Buddy story is developed and dispatched in a series of repetitive scenes where Maviss bad behaviour escalates in front of the two-dimensional local yokels. Each morning Mavis gets loaded comes to life by afternoon and gets gussied up to visit the guileless happily married Buddy once more. The climax comes at a baby-naming party amid spilled drinks and embarrassing revelations. The films ending avoids triteness at the cost of plausibility with a twisted joke that asks us to love Mavis not despite but because of her irrepressible vanity. Perhaps not accidentally the character of Buddys mother is played by Mary Beth Hurt who in 1979 starred in the similarly themed Chilly Scenes of Winter (aka Head Over Heels) a bittersweet allegory of lost ideals. Idealism isnt on the table in Young Adult a movie that like its abrasive heroine has an emotionally stunted soul beneath its superficial charm.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Phillip V. Caruso) The quote has been attributed to worldly wise philosopher Keith Richards No matter how beautiful a woman is theres a man somewhere who is sick of her.For tall blonde and boozy Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) that man is Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). Twenty years ago high school sweethearts Mavis and Buddy were the big fish in the small pond of Mercury Minn. But they drifted apart and Mavis swam upstream to Minneapolis where she floated in a pool of vodka and ghost-wrote a series of young-adult novels about a popular teen.When Mavis learns that Buddy has spawned a family she smells blood in the water and returns to Mercury to seize the prey. In the hands of a director like Garry Marshall a writer like Nora Ephron and a star like Julia Roberts circa 1990 ""Young Adult"" could have been a romantic farce with a happy ending. In the hands of Jason Reitman Diablo Cody and the never-better Theron its a scary-sad dramedy that never lets us off the hook.Reitman and Cody were co-conspirators on ""Juno"" but that teen-pregnancy satire was an after-school special compared to ""Young Adult."" The bombshell ingredient is Theron who wields her statuesque beauty like a baseball bat. After Mavis has trashed her own life she keeps swinging at everyone elses from dim-bulb Buddy to his saintly wife (Elizabeth Reaser) to a crippled barfly named Matt (Patton Oswalt) who was snubbed by Mavis in high school and is now free to tell her shes a crazy stalker. Yet Mavis and Matt are mirror images of arrested development and they play-act a foggy friendship in the garage where he keeps his action figures and home-brewed hootch. Oswalt the stand-up comedian who was unashamedly great as a schlubby sports-radio addict in the overlooked indie ""Big Fan"" is poignant here as the unhealed victim of a hate crime. So the blunt resolution of his subplot is particularly devastating. Clear-eyed fearless and ferociously funny ""Young Adult"" is mature filmmaking.""Young Adult""Three and a half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 134  Content Strong language and some sexual content Videos Watch a trailer for Young Adult Dec 15 2011 (...)

Starring Charlize Theron Patton Oswalt Patrick Wilson Director Jason Reitman Release Opened Dec 16 2011  Editorial Review Theron unleashes her inner dudeBy Michael OSullivanFriday Dec. 16 2011A funny thing has happened to Mavis Gary the title character in ""Young Adult"" a dark comedy from ""Junos"" writing-directing team of Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman. Not that anyone is laughing at Mavis. Not much anyway. Though marketed as a comedy this film is too creepy and acerbic to be consistently comic. Mavis played with perfect pitch by Charlize Theron - in a role that calls for her to be beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside - is a 37-year-old divorced writer facing the cancellation of her popular series of young adult novels. Lonely and depressed Mavis shuffles around her apartment in sweat pants swilling booze eating fast food watching bad TV and having meaningless sex all the while making insensitive comments about other people. Shes not just going through an emotional crisis. Apparently shes also turned into a dude. (Notwithstanding the Hello Kitty T-shirt cute red Mini Cooper and lap dog named Dolce.) Whatever the nature of her transformation its one on the order of Therons ""Monster"" character. The actress wholeheartedly embraces Maviss dark - and lets face it somewhat guylike - side with gusto. Its a performance thats as hard to look away from as it to watch especially when Mavis decides to return to the Podunk where she grew up in order to brazenly seduce Buddy (Patrick Wilson) the guy she dated in high school. Never mind that Buddy is now happily married with a brand-new baby. Admittedly there are some laughs here. Most come courtesy of Matt (Patton Oswalt) the overweight-geek former classmate of Mavis who improbably reconnects with her upon her arrival in Mercury Minn. Matt is the kind of guy who was invisible to the cool kids like Mavis in high school. He spends the rest of the film trying to talk her out of her scheme through a barrage of sardonic wisecracks. It doesnt work but its amusing to listen to as well as ultimately rather moving. Oswalt a comedian-turned-actor turns in a performance worthy of his co-star. In high school Matt was the victim of a brutal high-school beating by jocks that has left him cynical and in crutches - but not without the ability to feel his old classmates pain. They make an odd couple. Mavis is physically perfect but dangerously crazy. Matts body may be mangled but his brain and his heart are still working. Together they almost make one functional human being. (The films title refers equally to Mavis whose immaturity is obvious and to Matt whose hobbies include creating customized action figures.) Matt is also the only character who really truly sees Mavis. I said shes hard to watch and that applies to the other characters in the film just as much as it does to us in the audience. No one in ""Young Adult"" - not Buddy his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) or Maviss own mother (Jill Eikenberry) - is able to see how deranged Mavis has become until its almost too late. Shes not cute-crazy either but disturbingly damaged pulling her hair out in clumps. Though Reitman exhibits overall mastery of the films sour tone ""Young Adult"" at one point skirts melodrama by mere inches in a climactic showdown at Buddys house between Mavis and the Mercury townsfolk in which her characters dark history is revealed. Generally speaking though theres enough grit in the films gears to keep the forward motion from ever getting too smooth. It isnt the relationship between Mavis and Buddy that drives ""Young Adult"" anyway. Rather its Mavis and Matt - and the sweet unexpected turn that their friendship takes - that leads to the films greatest rewards. Matt may be the only character whos able to look Mavis in the eye but shes also the only one who really sees him.Contains obscenity and sexual dialogue.

With the very definition of an unsympathetic character (Charlize Theron up for the task) and a script that throws a bucket of ice water on the idea of redemption Adult plays like a willful provocation from the Juno team of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody.The laughs sneaky and squirm-inducing spring not from any series of social mishaps but from one haphazard sabotage mission. The kamikaze is one Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) a former Minneapolis high school beauty queen gone sour. The recently divorced author of a flagging young-adult series she doesnt just take it as a personal insult when her old flame (Patrick Wilson) announces that he and his wife have a new baby. She steels herself for the task of busting up the union. Nothing particularly wacky happens along the way. Mavis returns to her sleepy hometown. She strikes up an uneasy alliance with a misfit she barely remembers (Patton Oswalt who showed he can handle tricky comic tones in the underrated Big Fan). She flutters around her prey looks down her nose at what shes left behind and emerges as one of the most aggressively unlikable comedy heroines youll ever meet. Having fun yet? Probably not. But this risky venture wields an admirable brazenness and it starts with Theron. She already defaced her considerable beauty and won an Oscar as a serial killer in Monster. Here the transformation is more internal.Mavis life peaked back in high school; Young Adult gives us the monster that subsequently took root. This is a performance without ego in a movie that doesnt seem to care what you think.

Shes probably not someone youd want to encounter after noon either although she can put on a good face if you give her time with her makeup kit and a couple of shots of Makers Mark. More about Young Adult >> Theres certainly intelligence and wit there - albeit caustic ruthless - and she was the high school prom queen after all. But there she is rolling out of bed at the crack of 10 a.m. shoving her little fluffy Pomeranian onto the balcony because shes too groggy to get dressed and take it for a walk. Its quite a picture. And Young Adult directed by Jason Reitman from a script by his Juno collaborator Diablo Cody is quite a picture too. (For a while anyway.) A pitch-black comedy steeped in bitterness and regret the film follows Mavis - single cynical - as she gets the news that her old high school beau is now a proud dad. This is back in little Mercury Minn. and so Mavis who lives in a high-rise in booming Minneapolis climbs into her Mini Cooper punches in an old mix tape and drives back to her hometown to steal Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) from his loving wife and newborn. She may as well have a personalized license plate HOMEWRECKER. Or if thats too long simply WRECK will do. Theron is thrillingly nasty as Mavis. Her loneliness and desperation manifests itself in the contempt she shows for her old town and its denizens in her self-destructiveness and serial consumption of liquor. Its a great performance and Reitman - who went from Juno to Up in the Air another deft character study of a flawed and somewhat self-deluded individual - lets her have the run of things. But Young Adult which takes its title from the genre of fiction Mavis ghostwrites (Waverly Prep a series for tween girls) isnt as artfully realized as Up in the Air. Codys screenplay falls apart just when it needs to be the most taut and true during a painfully awkward confrontation on the front lawn of Buddys house. And Wilsons character is a blank slate - hes impossible to read perhaps because theres not much there or because hes an idealized figment of Mavis memory. But still he doesnt feel lived-in real. Patton Oswalt the comedian who did a fine dark turn in the 2009 indie Big Fan brings more substance to his portrayal of Matt Freehauf a nerd who was locker neighbors with Mavis in high school who lusted after her unrequitedly - and as it turns out unremembered. But when Mavis pulls up a stool at a Mercury saloon Matt is right there and they start to talk. ""Youre the hate crime guy"" she says finally recognizing him. Matt had been brutally attacked in the woods behind the football field pummeled by members of the football squad who thought he was gay. The relationship that develops between Mavis and Matt during her brief and disastrous trip home has a sad-sack poignancy about it. Theyre a couple of losers. Theyre pickled in alcohol. They bond.

When actors ask an audience to love them they risk the possibility that the audience will eventually stop. Neediness is unbecoming in a star. Sally Field had it. Tom Hanks flirts with it. And Jim Carreys need to be taken seriously then not that seriously has nearly ruined him. Charlize Therons desire to be appreciated beyond her beauty landed her in tough unsmiling movies like ""Monster ""North Country and ""The Burning Plain. We took her seriously but her idea of seriousness became loaded with misery - tremendous struggle and suffering and work. She was no longer an actress. She was a pack mule.So its a relief to see her in a breezy comedy like ""Young Adult. The movie doesnt weigh that much but it has a kind of point-blank piquancy that has gradually seeped out of American comedies which now are mostly going for broad topical gags that rarely venture into the relatable shadows of human behavior. ""Young Adult has a dark side and Therons attraction to it initially feels like a stunt. The pseudo-successful writer she plays - Mavis Gary - has all of Therons blondness and beauty but as we discover how ugly her heart is youre nervous that all Therons doing is ""Monster from the inside out.But Diablo Cody wrote ""Young Adult and its an improvement over ""Juno her first script. Here her sharpshooting is aimed at perpetual-adolescent archetypes. Mavis for instance is a ""psychotic prom-queen bitch according to a former victim and Theron plays the part in a bulletproof vest. Mavis is imperious and not particularly worldly. Her principles are based on a hilarious disdain for reality and stem from Codys cleverly conceived misunderstandings of tone. When Mavis in one of her milder drunken rants tells a pudgy crippled former classmate named Matt (Patton Oswalt) that shes snuck from Minneapolis back into her tiny Minnesota hometown essentially in order to steal a married ex-boyfriend (Patrick Wilson) away from his family her rationale is this ""Love conquers all. Havent you seen The Graduate? To which all one can ask is Has she?Mavis has ghostwritten a series of formerly popular teen books. Shes in the middle of bitterly writing the final installment which according to the narration Mavis provides from the contents of her laptop appears to be based on a self-serving interpretation of the havoc she wreaks. Its possible that Mavis saw ""The Graduate when she was a girl and has been hanging onto the youthful misperception that Benjamin Braddock broke up his sweethearts wedding out of love. He was desperate. Alas so is Mavis. She doesnt get that the final shot of the movie is Now what?Mavis has trumped up her adolescence so that her delusions of grandeur insulate her from the most painful truths about herself. Shes a supreme underminer. When Mavis enters Matts house which he shares with his sister (Collette Wolfe) she says ""I love your decor. Is it shabby chic? Shes also still the sort of grown-up high-school girl whose idea of sympathy is ""Oh my God. Embarrassing. (With her sweatpants hoodies purse-dog UGG boots flannel and general air of ""whatever shes Minneapolis by way of mid-2000s Santa Monica.) All of Maviss ideas of human behavior come from life as its lived in popular culture. And yet Codys familiar exaggeration of that life often feels true. Matt becomes a version of the oddball buddy (in school he was disfigured in a beating makes his own bourbon and still paints collectible figurines) trying to reason with Maviss conscience without realizing she doesnt really have one. But that relationship is the movies only concession to emotional connection and even then its spiked. The bond they create doesnt feel plausible (he permeates her firewall of snobbery too easily) but theres ironic dignity in Oswalts performance. He owns Matts pathos until hes the least pathetic person in the film.Cody attempts to provide some psychological and neurotic background for Maviss nuttiness (she plucks her hair for instance and neglects to tell her parents shes in town). But we dont necessarily need to know why Mavis is damaged to see that she is. Theron has that covered. The sight of her standing in one of those KFC-Taco Bell-Pizza Hut things - its a Kentacohut - wearing flannel and a pair of sagging jeans made me want to cry but I was already laughing.Some of the achievement of ""Young Adult is in the nimble way Cody and the director Jason Reitman use lightness not to laugh at the limitations of small-town life (which they treat a touch too harshly) but to capture the pity of prematurely peaking in life. The characters here dramatize a modern existential dilemma for generations of people who are getting older but who are also afraid to mature.Alexander Paynes ""The Descendants is being held up as a kind of paragon of this sort of comedy of responsibility. I doubt ""Young Adult will receive the same accolades. Its not as handsome or as smooth (Reitman did smooth in ""Juno and ""Up in the Air) but Cody and Reitman have the more daring comedy. The final sequence of ""Young Adult is devastatingly committed comedy after Paynes heart.At some point Theron takes a long sniff from a tube of craft glue. Its a juvenile high. She turns Maviss pathology into kaleidoscopic narcissism. Its a tightrope walk similar to the one Laura Dern just performed on the HBO show ""Enlightened which seduced you into watching a difficult character dig herself out of trouble she caused. This movie doesnt have a shovel. But Theron doesnt need one. The deeper Maviss hole gets the more psychotic force Theron gathers. This actress is poised at the same ""Graduate moment as her self-destructed character. Now what?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Young Adult Good Director Jason Reitman. Cast Charlize TheronPatton Oswalt Patrick Wilson. Rating R for language and some sexual content. Not horror like disemboweling nubile teens. This is worse the horror of someone whose refusal to grow up and mature has consequences for the people around her. The first pairing between director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody since 2007s ""Juno"" mines much more uncomfortable territory in telling the story of Mavis Gary played brilliantly by Charlize Theron. Mavis was the popular girl in high school whose life hasnt turned out the way she wanted (or the way she pretends). So she heads back to her hometown to try to reclaim what she believes by rights is hers Buddy her old boyfriend. Interview Patton Oswalt Never mind that hes happily married and has a new baby. Mavis a bitter alcoholic with absolutely no regard for anyone other than herself doesnt let such details concern her. She ghostwrites young-adult novels while living in a wreck of an apartment pursuing anonymous hookups and drinking herself to sleep. Yet to those who still know anything about her back in her small hometown shes the successful author who moved to the big city. When Mavis gets an e-mail birth announcement from Buddy (Patrick Wilson) she decides he is what she needs So she packs up her small dog and heads home planning to wow Buddy with her beauty and sophistication. The beauty she still has when she can be bothered to fix herself up. The sophistication was never there. In a bar the night before shes to meet Buddy who thinks shes just there to say hello she runs into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) whom she refers to as ""the hate-crime kid."" In fact Matt had the locker beside Mavis for four years; she just never bothered to learn his name. He is disabled because punks in high school nearly beat him to death suspecting he was gay even though he isnt. He walks with a crutch lives with his sister and builds superhero models switching the parts from one to another to create tiny hybrids. Spotting something of a fellow traveler in Mavis whos far more damaged than he is Matt sees right through her. He tells her that Buddy is a happy man with a great home life; this is true. But no Mavis protests. She and Buddy are meant to be together fate will work things out. Her delusions are breathtaking. Yet she soldiers on unaware and unconcerned about the damage she causes. Its not pretty and at times its hard to watch. On the other hand at other times its screamingly funny. Credit Cody and Reitman for not softening Mavis edges and Theron for completely inhabiting the role of this selfish creature. We recognize Mavis perhaps in people we have known. We certainly hope not to identify with her. But the bitter mean things she says can be savagely hilarious. Theron is great. So is Oswalt making Matt the voice of reason. It would be easy to feel sorry for Matt but Oswalt doesnt let us. The oddball chemistry between him and Theron is unlike anything were used to seeing in this kind of movie and all the more successful because of it. In fact ""Young Adult"" is unlike most movies were used to seeing. Reitman makes bold choices with the story. Not all are fun to watch in the moment but they add up to a satisfying portrait of a woman off the rails someone we can laugh at even when were horrified.

"Young Adult (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Young Adult (R) Charlize Theron shines in this bitter comedy from the ""Juno"" team of screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/14/2011 Editor rating 3 Every time youre ready to write off Hollywood comedies along comes a picture like Young Adult to keep hope alive. How did this unapologetically sour movie make its way through the studio system and land a coveted December release date? A lot of people are going to be baffled by Charlize Therons performance as Mavis Gary an author of novels for teenagers who returns to her home town of Mercury Minnesota to derail the marriage of her former high school flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Buddy loves his wife and just became a father but Mavis assumes he is profoundly unhappy and will be powerless to resist her come-ons. He couldnt possibly be satisfied by his grotesquely domestic life. Right? Young Adult was written by Diablo Cody whose two previous films (Juno and Jennifers Body) centered on teenagers. In a way this one too is about adolescence Mavis is 37 but she still views the world as if she were 17 when she always got her way when her beauty made everyone fawn over her when she was queen of her small world and she won Best Hair. Mavis is a repellent human being -- an adult version of the imperious cool kids from school -- and the unlikeliest of rom-com heroines. But Theron plays her straight without compromise or ironic distancing and the character is so misguided and discomfiting that you often dont know whether to laugh or pity her. ""Oh how embarrassing"" the would-be homewrecker says with disdain when she finds out Buddys wife (Elizabeth Reaser) moonlights as a drummer for an indie band. ""Love conquers all"" Mavis remarks while plotting to steal Buddy away. ""Have you not seen The Graduate? Or like anything?"" Director Jason Reitman (Juno Up in the Air) takes a cue from Therons upfront approach and doesnt trick up the movie with artificial stylings. Young Adult is just as blunt and direct as Mavis and the honesty adds a layer of squirmy discomfort to moments such as Mavis first rendezvous with Buddy at a local hangout or her conversations with another former classmate Matt (Patton Oswalt). The comedian is terrific as a man who has resigned himself to the life of a geeky loner Like Mavis he never outgrew his high school persona and he uses the crippling injuries he suffered at the hands of bullies as an excuse to keep the rest of the world at bay. Not surprisingly Matt turns out to be one of the few people with whom Mavis can form a connection. She can relax around him because he doesnt judge her alcoholism and he says things like ""Guys like me are born loving women like you."" With Mavis flattery will get you everywhere. A fat streak of melancholy courses throughout Young Adult -- who would have guessed the sight of a Kentaco Hut one of those one-stop conglomerations of Kentucky Fried Chicken Taco Bell and Pizza Hut could be this depressing? -- and even the alt-rock songs on the soundtrack (4 Non Blondes Veruca Salt and especially Teenage Fanclubs The Concept) carry a tinge of sadness. Theyre bits of nostalgia blown up to fill empty lives; theyre rueful oldies. This may all make Young Adult sound somewhat gloomy but its really not. The humor in the film just happens to be uncomfortable because Mavis is too arrogant and oblivious to learn the Important Lessons this sort of comedy always imparts. But you cant really bring yourself to dismiss this irreparable woman outright. ""Its like the rest of us changed and you got lucky"" Buddy says when he sees that Mavis looks pretty much the same way she did 20 years earlier. He means that as a compliment. But Young Adult eloquently implies that can be a condemnation too. Cast Charlize Theron Patton Oswalt Patrick Wilson Elizabeth Reaser Jill Eikenberry. Director Jason Reitman.

Theres the small town Minnesota setting the sharp dialogue and the insights into how people act when theyre put under stress. At the same time the film superficially recalls Garden State and a host of other films about Gen X identity crises as floundering young-adult-fiction writer Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) returns to her hometown on a desperate quest to reconnect with her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) who is now a married father. But Young Adult is an entirely different beast and significantly departs from the films it outwardly resembles. Where most of its counterparts opt for cohesive sentimental storytelling arcs Codys script hews closer to real life. At its core theres a depressing yet inescapable truth People dont fundamentally change. Thats a radical idea at least by Hollywoods standards. In its disregard for what Abraham Lincoln called ""the better angels of our nature"" Young Adult rejects the usual mandate to produce movies with the widest possible appeal. Its also what makes this such a fascinating if flawed enterprise an exercise in a new form of nihilistic horror. Mavis is one of those people who peaked in high school and has been floundering ever since. The ex-prom queen lives alone in a Minneapolis apartment where she spends her time feeling sorry for herself downing two-liter bottles of diet coke and sleeping in front of the television. Shes pushing 40 unhappy with her career and emotionally adrift. With a machine-like focus and steadfast resolve Mavis decides that the only way to recapture her vanished sense of self-worth is to reconnect with the happily married Buddy and steal him from his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser). The movie has empathy for Mavis and her plight of course. Thered be no point in making it if it didnt. But Cody has written a fundamentally unappealing character a woman who compensates for her deep self-disgust by manipulating everyone in her path plowing ahead with an almost total disregard for the needs and desires of other people. Its a brave challenging part a monster of a different sort than the Monster that won Theron an Academy Award. Unsurprisingly the consistently top-notch actress is up for the task revealing the deep cracks in Maviss fragile psyche. In Therons hands the characters immature high school affectations--waving shots around in a bar aggressively flirting with Buddy looking at a baby like its a terrifying alien--come from a convincing unhappy place. Its a full-throttle full-body performance with everything from the slightest twitch to the most overstated reaction of disgust revealing a woman stuck in severely arrested development. Reitman smartly underplays things opting for an observational tack that lets Codys script and his terrific lead do the talking. He doesnt attempt a grand social statement and there are no attention-seeking stylistic flourishes. Instead Reitman imbues the film with a violent darkly comic sensibility burrowing full-throttle into the mind of a woman whos too proud to recognize all that shes lost and all that she still stands to lose. Living inside Maviss head isnt the most appealing proposition. Its an uncomfortably deluded place imbued with an aggressively misguided value system. Shes preoccupied with endless primping and grooming and is most at home when shes inebriated or putting down others feeding an ego that needs constant refreshment. The movie might have left a greater visceral impact had Reitman and Cody decided to make it about her awakening to the errors of her ways and gaining a renewed sense of whats really important. Theres not much emotional weight to the proceedings because the character is such a nightmarish concoction of negativity. But that happier version of Young Adult would have been a much less notable achievement. Even with a subplot that doesnt really work involving Maviss friendship with former high-school outcast Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) Reitman and Cody have made a big studio prestige picture that provides a realistic look at the darkest impulses of an unlikable character. It trades in discomfort and unease not catharsis. Thats an achievement worthy of admiration if you can endure it.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 9 2011 Save for later Saved Charlize Theron stars as former prom queen Mavis Gary in the new film Young Adult. Carlo Allegri/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you can believe Charlize Theron as a loveless layabout then youll probably buy into ""Young Adult"" the new movie from director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody the team that brought us ""Juno."" Actually Theron does a fairly convincing job. Its the movie surrounding her that isnt quite so convincing.She plays heavy drinker Mavis Gary divorced and pushing 40 who lives in a messy Minneapolis apartment and ghostwrites a popular teen novel series. When she discovers her old high school flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) have a new baby she uses that information as an excuse to return after many years to her Minnesota hometown and lure him back.She doesnt disguise her disgust at the towns hicksville trappings even though she is regarded as a celebrity among her many high school classmates who chose to remain there. One of those classmates though Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) is on to her. As she makes her move on the clueless (or just preternaturally polite) Buddy Matt repeatedly calls her out. Only he it seems understands not only what she is up to but also how self-defeatingly hopeless it all is. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The dumpy Matt has his own back story While in high school he was brutally attacked by bullies for supposedly being gay - hes not - and he still suffers wounds from the experience. Its inevitable that Mavis and Matt should form a kind of oddball alliance if only because Mavis cant get any traction with anyone else in town and because Matt despite his bred-in-the-bone cynicism still sees Mavis as the prom queen. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Oswalt and Theron work so well together that they almost make this subplot - which has the emotional heft of the main plot - come alive. But theres something amiss at the heart of this movie Mavis for all her knockabout manias is intended to be a sympathetic soul and the film itself is essentially framed as a comedy. But the filmmakers may be just as clueless as Buddy when it comes to Mavis who resembles nothing so much as a snooty stalker. In the end they resist just barely the temptation to redeem her but by that time we may have joined with the fed-up small-towners in wishing her a rapid fare-thee-well.

As played by Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin free-spirited travel writer Eva has been just barely holding it together since the moment her colicky son was born. He cries so much as an infant that in desperation Eva takes him for walks near construction sites where the sound of jackhammers provides a few seconds respite from the sound of his shrieking.

But hes preternaturally cagey and no one else including her husband (John C. Reilly) understands why Eva has such a problem with him. By the time Kevins in his teens (played by unnervingly angular Ezra Miller) shes actively frightened of him especially when household accidents begin endangering his younger sister. Though the film leaps around in time youre never in doubt that Kevin will turn out to be a sociopath. The clues arent subtle -- grieving parents scream at and even slug Eva kids splatter red paint on her house and car. Youll wonder about the whats and whys but We Need to Talk About Kevin is less a horror story about a malicious kid than a study of his moms increasing panic that it might be her less-than-motherly feelings toward him that have turned him monstrous. Director Lynne Ramsay underlines Evas fears with more blood-red imagery than is really necessary -- glasses of cabernet oozing jelly sandwiches a supermarket panic attack in front of a wall of tomato soup cans. i The angsty Mavis (Charlize Theron) a teen-fiction writer plots to save her high-school beau from what she believes is a too-mundane married life in Young Adult.

Credit Paramount Pictures From Young Adult - The Character Bible The Character Bible Credit Paramount Pictures From Young Adult - Picture A Failed Marriage Picture A Failed Marriage Credit Paramount Pictures Mavis peers may have graduated to jobs and marriage but she still sees the world in terms of cliques and boyfriends. A birth announcement from a former flame has prompted a return to her hometown from the big city -- and some ill-advised fantasizing. Though Buddy (Patrick Wilson) is happily married she decides he needs rescuing from domestic bliss and cruises into his life in glam overdrive dressed to the nines as she meets him in down-home bars and chicken joints. Charlize Theron won her Oscar for Monster a far darker character study than this film and screenwriter Diablo Cody won hers for Juno a much sunnier comedy. So it makes sense that Young Adult feels at times like a mashup of styles and genres -- part curdled rom-com part psycho-prom-queen flick with a little Revenge of the Nerds thrown in. The nerdiness comes courtesy of Patton Oswalt as a onetime bullying victim -- ""Youre the hate-crime kid"" blurts Mavis when he jogs her memory in a bar -- for whom she had no time in school but with whom she now has much in common Neither of them has remotely grown up. In a less acid romp Mavis would learn life lessons in the final reel but director Jason Reitman makes it a point not to let her off the hook. The big-city life shes carved out for herself may look glamorous to the small-town folks shes slumming with but shes miserable her expensive condo a pigsty her career a joke her social and romantic prospects nonexistent. And all of it is her fault. Shes arrived at what ought to be maturity as ugly on the inside as she is gorgeous on the outside. She is also -- and this is what makes Young Adult catch you up short -- hauntingly alone at a point in life when she didnt expect to be. You could also say that about Tilda Swintons Eva in We Need to Talk About Kevin. The films could hardly be more different -- one tragic the other comic -- but at center theyre both about the same modern malady the life that hasnt turned out as planned.

"Charlize Theron shines in Young Adult but her character has it too easy |       NJ.com comments Charlize Theron shines in Young Adult but her character has it too easy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 09 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments ""Young Adult"" is a movie about a gorgeous successful woman who nonetheless lives like a slob cant keep a serious relationship going and cant quite forget the high school love of her life. So she leaves the big city to go back to her crummy little hometown and try to win him back. It sounds a little like yet another Katherine Heigl movie. But this is actually a Charlize Theron movie with Jason Reitman directing a script from Diablo Cody. And that makes a difference. Thats because nobody here -- Theron chief among them -- is worried about making its heroine likable. Yes Mavis is tall thin and beautiful and subsists on booze and junk food which is itself a bit of a cliche -- generally people who live on KFC and bourbon look like they live on KFC and bourbon. So theres that nod to Hollywood convention. But Mavis is also wicked. How wicked? Shes a drunken driver. Shes mean to everybody. Oh and that boyfriend shes determined to win back is married happily -- to a special-ed teacher no less -- and they even have a new baby. But pour Mavis another Makers Mark and get out of her way because nothing matters except getting what she wants. Although the direction seems a little matter-of-fact after Reitmans great ""Up in the Air"" and interesting ""Thank You for Smoking"" he quietly gets the ugly ex-urban sprawl just right. The soundtrack is also a good collection of just the sort of tunes these 30-somethings would have been listening to back in their glory days. Paramount PicturesPatrick Wilson plays Buddy Slade and Charlize Theron plays Mavis Gary in ""Young Adult."" And the film is anchored by good performances from Theron who is clearly glad to be back in a lead role after some time off and Patton Oswalt as a former love-struck classmate she can barely remember. Codys script gives them both great lines and Theron is skilled at the small gesture -- like the way she hugs ex-beau Patrick Wilson just a moment too long. But then in the last 20 minutes the film falters as it pushes its idea just one step too far. Its fine to have an unlikable heroine; its even fine to have a heroine who does not change or learn a single thing from her experiences. People only have to grow in therapy; in drama its quite acceptable if -- like ""Hud"" or Tony Soprano -- they remain as unpleasant at the end of their stories as they were at the beginning. No ""Young Adult"" finally stumbles not because it tries to make us like Mavis but because everyone else in it seems to no matter what she does. No one ever calls her on her undeserved snobbishness (this ""big-city author"" is actually a Minneapolis ghostwriter of teen-romance paperbacks) and even Oswalts character still makes excuses for her. The films first hour or so climaxing with Mavis throwing drunken verbal jabs at a family party is pretty great; when it comes to snark this gal is a champ and its fun to watch her work out. But itd be a real bout -- and an even better movie -- if someone in her own weight class occasionally hit back. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations and alcohol abuse. Young Adult (R) Paramount (94 min.) Directed by Jason Reitman. With Charlize Theron Patton Oswalt Patrick Wilson. Now playing in New York. Opens in New Jersey Dec. 16.

But even in the ""do as I say not as I divorce"" world of film its something of an exception to get a movie like ""Young Adult"" which features a lead character whos selfish conniving and despicable but ultimately doesnt seem to learn a single thing. Its an imperfect film to be sure but the movies refusal to sacrifice its leading lady on the altar of Heres How to Behave feels downright revolutionary. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) may have reached her 30s but shes as shallow and narcissistic as the popular high school girls she writes about in a ""young adult"" book series thats in its waning days. Reeling from a recent divorce and battling writers block Mavis finds herself compelled to return to her small Minnesota town when she receives a birth notice from Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) the wife of Mavis high school beau Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). Over drinks at a local bar Mavis confides in her old classmate Matt (Patton Oswalt) -- they had adjoining lockers but she never spoke to him -- that her agenda is to win Buddy back new baby or no new baby. Despite her tales of literary success and heavy usage of foundation however Mavis comes to realize that shes not fooling anyone into thinking that shes got her life together. Also read Jason Reitman Charlize Theron Sneak Young Adult Narcissism ""Young Adult"" works best in its portrayal of Mavis unapologetically bratty behavior and Theron clearly relishes the opportunity to play a woman whos both smart and deluded bitchy and vulnerable underhanded and capable of real friendship. (Her unlikely chemistry with Oswalt will continue to flourish in other movies if theres any justice.) While Therons Mavis pops off the screen as a fresh and unusual film character however the rest of the film doesnt quite live up to her standards. Diablo Codys screenplay feels like a step forward after ""Juno"" and ""Jennifers Body"" -- apart from one reference to a ""Ken-Taco-Hut"" an abbreviation for a combination KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut it doesnt feel like shes throwing new catch phrases at the wall in the hopes that one will stick -- but it lacks a certain forward momentum. Re-teaming with Jason Reitman (and after ""Up in the Air"" ""Young Adult"" is something of a step backward) Cody juggles interesting ideas and characters but zips past potentially interesting subplots and doesnt build on the situations as effectively as she might have. There are some fun scenes and compelling interplay but despite the many good ideas on tap here the movie doesnt feel like it goes anywhere all that interesting apart from its refusal to punish Mavis for her wicked wicked ways. One of the best facets of ""Young Adult"" bodes well for Codys upcoming work Mavis narration of the book shes writing makes a terrific counterpoint to whats happening to her and Cody has gone on record saying that shes planning to bring the vintage YA series ""Sweet Valley High"" to the screen. With any luck that film will play to her strengths while also polishing up her still-rough edges. In the meantime kudos to Cody for creating one of her most indelible characters to date and to Reitman for having the good sense to hand the role to Theron. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Patton Oswalt does nuanced funny work as a bookkeeper in a bar. You know were in the thick of the movie awards season when an Oscar-winning actress like Charlize Theron is playing an alcoholic reliving her adolescence by breaking up her ex-boyfriends marriage. ""Young Adult like director Jason Reitmans earlier ""Juno (also written with a sharp knowing ear by Diablo Cody) fortunately has the dark (sometimes very dark) wit to wear its ambitions lightly. It also boasts a killer breakout performance by comic Patton Oswalt as a former classmate who becomes Therons unlikely co-dependent and sometimes co-conspirator. Theron wore pounds of makeup for her Oscar-winning role as serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster (2003). Mavis the gorgeous if unhinged character she plays here is a different variety of monster the kind who may pose the greatest danger to herself. Mavis who subsists on fast food booze and Diet Coke is a writer struggling to complete the final episode in a series of teenage novels thats just been canceled. Recently divorced and living in Minneapolis she is also stubbornly holding onto her own adolescence a decade and a half after the fact. An invitation to a naming ceremony for the ex-boyfriends new son triggers a synapse in Mavis booze- and romance-addled brain. She convinces herself that the ex Buddy (Patrick Wilson) is feeling ""trapped"" right now and will welcome her efforts to ""rescue"" him. Upon her return to their small home town of Mercury Minn. the newly dolled-up Mavis deludes herself into thinking that Buddys willingness to meet her for a drink and his compliments mean hes open to her overtures. Buddy a simple guy who dotes on his wife (Elizabeth Reaser) and his son is oblivious to Mavis motives almost to the point of stupidity. But Matt (Oswalt) who works as a bookkeeper in the bar where the rendezvous occurs instantly sizes up the situation as well as Mavis extreme vulnerability. Its Matts intervention and Oswalts finely nuanced and sometimes very funny work that helps make it clear that Theron will not be channeling Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction which seems like a distinct possibility at first. A toad compared to Buddys prince Matt has been nursing his own crush on Mavis since high school -- not that shes ever much noticed him even after a gay-bashing incident left him permanently handicapped. But times change and Mavis no longer the prom queen is happy to liberally partake of the open bar that Matt maintains from a still in the garage of the split-level he shares with his sister. Matt -- who incidentally claims not to be gay -- is happy to listen for hours to Mavis talk about her fantasies about a new life with Buddy and occasionally even attempts to introduce his new friend to a soupcon of adult reality. Reitman (he also did the superb ""Up in the Air) and Cody fill the movie with telling moments including Mavis increasingly frantic attempts to present herself as looking just like the girl that Buddy fell in love with all those years ago. There is another devastating scene in which Mavis tells her utterly uncomprehending parents she thinks she ""may be an alcoholic. Its also easy to underestimate the contribution of Reaser -- an intelligent and underused actress Ive long liked a lot -- as Buddys wife. It would be easy to play her as jealous of the returning small-time vamp. More difficult still is to portray a less-than-gorgeous mother (and occasional bar-band performer) who is so confident of her husbands devotion that shes able to look beyond Mavis increasingly inappropriate behavior with some measure of sympathy. Therons Mavis in fact does some things that made me cringe in ""Young Adult. But nobody ever said that adolescence was pretty even if an increasing number of people are experiencing its final pangs on the cusp of middle age.

Caruso Paramount Pictures Young Adult review Dark comedy a bright spot 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Young Adult Drama. Starring Charlize Theron Patton Oswalt and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Jason Reitman. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Young Adult"" is a dark comedy that confirms Diablo Cody (""Juno"") as a screenwriter of importance eliminates the last shred of doubt that Jason Reitman is a major director and gives Charlize Theron her best showcase since ""Monster."" In fact ""Young Adult"" is even better than ""Monster"" in that its not a stunt movie requiring a Halloween-costume performance but one in which the actress gets to show brand-new skills and colors through her own familiar face. In a seemingly casual way Theron does something remarkable. She takes a character who should be unsympathetic - a condescending delusional unpleasant amoral woman with no grace or kindness - and makes us feel for her. She does this with the help of Reitman and Cody by keying into the characters pain making us recognize a sadness that the character herself doesnt even see. Mavis (Charlize Theron) is in her early 30s a time when the limits of life are first felt and yet the romance of the teen years is still a vivid memory. In her career Mavis is almost successful. She writes young-adult novels for a popular series but really is a ghostwriter working off an outline. She lives in the city and feels grandly superior to the people back home but she is thinking about them a lot more than theyre thinking about her. Then one day she finds out that her high school sweetheart and his wife have had a child and she becomes possessed by the idea of returning home and stealing the ex from his family. ""Young Adult"" achieves a specific tone that Reitman maintains throughout. The tone might be described as a combination of two perspectives which throughout are viewing the action at a remove. The first perspective is that of Mavis who is in some ways crazy and yet also is clear-eyed in that she sees the blandness and provinciality of her Midwest hometown. ""Everyone here is fat and dumb"" she says and she is not exactly wrong. Related Stories Review Theron shines in the dark comedy Young Adult Review Young Adult The second perspective closer to ours is that of Matt played by Patton Oswalt. Matt is Codys most inspired creation a poor guy whose life was wrecked in high school when he got shafted twice First he was the target of a hate crime which gave him a permanent limp and made sex difficult. Second he had the misfortune of being abandoned by the media and the authorities once they realized that he wasnt actually gay that he was just mistaken for gay. Matt sees everything thats absurd about Mavis - he understands that the ex-boyfriend (Patrick Wilson) is deliriously happy with his family and has no interest in her. He also understands that Mavis is absolutely miserable just as miserable as Matt is even if she doesnt know it. This interaction - between Matt and Mavis Oswalt and Theron - makes the movie. Matt is chubby limping and a foot shorter than Mavis so he knows he has no chance with her. Thus he has no reason not to be himself and tell her things she doesnt want to hear. As for Mavis she thinks she is hanging out with Matt because there is nobody else in town but in fact there is a connection - not romantic exactly but that of two people in a similar crisis of spirit. Through Oswalt (who has a beautiful sensitivity) and Theron we see that connection almost instantaneously. The filmmakers devise a series of funny appalling incidents and many other smaller moments that are subtly awful that can make your skin crawl with discomfort. In a good way. Between the laughs it keeps its focus on Mavis misery and though it goes to soft places it never goes soft on us. Thats the best news of all that ""Young Adult"" is just as tough and caustic at the finish as at the start. E-mail Mick LaSalle mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Young Adult review Charlize Theron plays mean to perfection - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Charlize TheronYoung Adult review Charlize Theron plays mean to perfectionDirector Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody add their distinct light touch to dark comedy Young Adult with Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt terrific as troubled beauty and sarcastic beast.December 09 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt star in ""Young Adult."" (Phillip V. Caruso / Paramount...)When its done right as it is in ""Young Adult"" there is something absolutely mesmerizing about watching a train wreck unfold on screen. When the wreck in question is a narcissistic beauty played to scheming sour downward-spiraling perfection by Charlize Theron cringing is definitely called for but so is laughter. In fact thats exactly the reaction director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody are going for. Paired up for the first time since their 2007 knockout punch ""Juno"" the two ironists have switched sides in a sense. While ""Juno"" celebrated an acerbic outsider pregnant teen in ""Young Adult"" they are interested in the prom queen a still pretty still mean and now a decade into life on her own. Its not going well. This is comedy extracted from pain start to finish with its through-a-shot-glass-darkly story starting in Minneapolis a or Mini-Apple as her small hometown friends call it. Mavis (Theron) spends her days writing young adult novels basically high school in-crowd pulp and her nights making the club scene binge-drinking sleeping around and surprised to find happiness eluding her. The self-absorbed stream of consciousness of a teenager that she needs for the books comes easily for her which seems like a gift until you realize that is how she still thinks. The time she spends writing in front of the computer working through issues for her characters also serves as a handy voice-over device to let us in on just how much growing up Mavis still has to do. That journey begins in earnest when she heads back home to pick up things with her high school sweetheart football star Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). That hes married and has just had a baby doesnt alter her resolve. But things take an unexpected turn when she encounters Matt Freehauf the high school geek shed forgotten about. Comedian Patton Oswalt (""King of Queens"" ""Big Fan"") is exceptional playing a sarcastic devils advocate forever prodding Mavis toward her better self. Their friction and their friendship their brush with romance is what gives the film its humor and its heart. ""Young Adult"" needs a lot of that to soften the outrage as Mavis sets about seducing Buddy who looks as fresh-scrubbed and outdoorsy as if he just walked out of an L.L. Bean catalog. Elizabeth Reaser plays Beth very likable as the new mom the patient wife a wannabe rocker who jams with a bunch of other new mothers. She represents a nice bit of smart tartness added to what is more typically a throw-away character. But Buddy and Beth are really just on the edge of the storm being whipped up by Mavis and Matt. Theron and Oswalt turn out to be a terrific odd couple. Not easy because Codys screenplay calls for and Reitman demands that they both reveal a great deal and a great deal of what they reveal is exceedingly ugly. In Mavis it is her unintentional drive to destroy everything and anyone who comes close and for this Theron uses her statuesque beauty as if it is just something else in life to be squandered. Though Mavis is creating a different sort of mayhem than the murdering Aileen that earned Theron an Oscar for ""Monster"" in 2004 the actress has taken as much care in creating all of the character wrinkles a the heaviness of an alcoholic getting started the morning after the strands of hair she pulls when she cant drink away the nerves. In contrast to Therons beauty Oswalt is required to play the beast a specifically the gimp that no one who looks like Mavis should ever fall for. Hes bitter about more than the fact that a brutal beating in high school left him nearly dead the limp and the cane a constant reminder. That Oswalt is able to work the very raw deal Matt has been given to devastating and cynically and comically superb effect is a tribute to the extraordinary humorist/character actor hes become. He and Theron dance on the edge of arch from the first time they meet in a bar until the films weirdly satisfying end. Though this is very unlike ""Juno"" the film does share the distinctive voice of its writer. In Mavis Cody is giving us another unexpected sort of female protagonist. Her great fondness for flaws makes it possible for us to empathize with the appalling to savor the humor in the foibles. As a filmmaker Reitman proves to be a very good counterbalance the right mitigating factor for this particular mess. In ""Young Adult"" the director continues to refine his imprint a the light touch he brings to dark comedy perhaps never more appealingly than in 2009s ""Up in the Air"" with George Clooney and Vera Farmiga caught in a bad romance. He is so completely at ease in the quirky gritty worlds Cody creates that it helps us deal with the discomfort. Working with cinematographer Eric Steelberg his frequent collaborator Reitman allows just the right amount of grime into the people and places. The sports bar where so much of the action and interaction takes place is a paean to middle-class malaise. There is a brashness of style that both Cody and Reitman embody a almost demanding that we not only laugh at but like the unlikable side of the human condition. That sort of bravado is fine if youve got the goods to back it up. In the cutting edginess of Theron and Oswalt they definitely do. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDrumming up support for Tasmanias unsexy beastMarch 27 2011Digging deep to stake their claimSeptember 11 2005Today a Movie Beautys Got to Look BeastlyMarch 2 2004You Have Been WarnedJanuary 20 2002Lovable Joe a Genial Gorilla Tale for the FamilyDecember 25 1998MORE STORIES ABOUTCharlize TheronBeastProm QueenCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-young-adult-20111209,0,2037513.story?track=rss",200,youngadult19,youngadult,latimes

Slate Sign In Sign Up Young Adult a Bitter Mean Memorable Anti-Romantic Comedy Young Adult a Bitter Mean Memorable Anti-Romantic Comedy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 8 2011 540 PM Young Adult Charlize Theron and Diablo Cody team up for a bitter mean memorable anti-romantic comedy. By Dan Kois Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt in Young Adult. Photograph by Phillip V. Caruso/Paramount Pictures and Mercury Productions. All rights reserved. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on Young Adult after youve seen the movie. Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. December is the season of puffed-up Award Movies. Whether good or bad War Horse and We Bought a Zoo and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy all have a prestige-y sameness to them. So consider Young Adult (Paramount)--a collaboration between the Juno tag team of director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody--a sharp stick to puncture those bloated hopefuls. Young Adult doesnt fully work but its still one of the years most memorable movies a ruthless portrait of a heroine with a serious love/loathe relationship with herself. Thats Mavis Geary (Charlize Theron) a ghostwriter of a once-popular series of young-adult novels. For Monster Theron gained weight and wore deglamorizing prosthetics and was rewarded with an Oscar. In Young Adult she looks as great as she ever has but shes a monster nonetheless. Indeed I prefer this performance--its sly and acid rather than spectacular. Spurred on by a birth announcement she interprets as a cry for help Mavis returns from Minneapolis to her hometown of Mercury Minn. intent on rescuing her high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson) from a life of what she assumes to be parental misery. That Buddy seems perfectly happy does not matter a bit. ""Im a married man"" he protests at one point. ""I know"" she coos in response. ""We can beat this thing together."" Advertisement Mavis has plenty of problems. Her series is getting canceled and shes having trouble writing the final volume. She drinks to excess. (Number of times we see Mavis pass out face-down in her clothes four.) She seems convinced that back home in Mercury the social order of high school remains firm; after a few days shes wearing her old clothes and cruising around town in her Cabriolet. (Of course she had a Cabriolet.) In high school however she would never have hung out with nerdy Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt). When she runs into Matt in a bar she doesnt recognize his name even though they had lockers next to each other for four years. Matt now a bookkeeper at a local restaurant tags along on Mavis ridiculous quest and their budding friendship such as it is makes for the films best scenes. As an actor Oswalt--a brilliant stand-up--has come a long way since his days of standing completely frozen for an entire opening sequence of The King of Queens. In Young Adult hes funny appealing and touching a bitter truth-teller to Therons glamorous relentless fabulist. ""Youre fucking mentally ill"" he says with dawning realization as she spins her future with Buddy into a story out of her teen romance novels. What I enjoyed most about Young Adult is how it functions as an anti-romantic comedy. Scenes from the rom-com playbook--the meet-cute the big confession the first kiss the pep talk from a friend--turn skewed and absurd thanks to Mavis appalling lack of self-awareness. Its reminiscent of 2009s Seth Rogen-starring Observe and Report which also employed an imbalanced main character to turn formulaic story beats into moments of creeping horror. Young Adult isnt as rigorous as that film which never shied away from the dark and awful ramifications of its premise. The ending of Young Adult on the other hand is tonally uncertain; my colleague Dana Stevens and I for instance have completely opposite interpretations of what happens in the final moments. As with Observe audiences arent likely to embrace Young Adult; after the screening I attended everyone on the elevator (other than me) was visibly angry about the movie theyd just watched. But I admired Young Adult for its chutzpah and Theron for her go-for-broke performance. Most of all I rejoiced in Diablo Codys deft funny angry script. Where Juno hid a conventional story under its jargon-studded ostensibly subversive surface Young Adult is genuinely radical (and hamburger-phone free). Im happy that Cody has mined her own obsession with teenagedom--and her experience of being a minor celebrity--and turned it into something spikier and more uncompromising than I would have expected. Im keeping my fingers crossed for Codys happiness but boy was I fascinated by Mavis misery. Correction Dec. 12 2011 (SPOILER ALERT) An earlier version of the Spoiler Special podcast referred to a character in Young Adult having an abortion. The character instead suffered a miscarriage.

She peaked in high school where she was the sort of popular girl who never noticed the schlump whose locker was next to hers for four years.She won ""best hair"" in high school but two decades later she nervously pulls out clumps of it.The best lines belong to Patton Oswalt who plays Matt Freehauf the fellow with the adjoining locker. As a teenager he was badly beaten in a gay-bashing incident. They run into each other in a bar and Mavis dimly remembers the ""scuffle"" addressing him as ""that hate crime guy.""When Mavis drunkenly reveals her plans to reclaim her man Matt reminds her that Buddy is happily married and a new father. No big deal she insists.""Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together and Im here to get him back"" she confides to Matt who urges her to seek professional help.Her dismissive attitude toward the baby is dryly humorous ""Ive got baggage too.""Young Adult has the snark but not the upbeat resolution of 2007s Juno screenwriter Cody and director Jason Reitmans last joint effort. While on sardonic turf its scathingly funny. Then it veers from biting wit to pitiful. At one juncture the story threatens to spin off into Fatal Attraction territory.But the filmmakers get points for acknowledging that people rarely change. Redemption is just not in the cards for Mavis as much as we hope it might be. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Young Adult"" the new collaboration from ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody shares some stylistic notes with their earlier effort. Its set in Minnesota features a pop-saturated soundtrack (including the Replacements) a woman-child stuck between adolescence and adulthood and a droll appreciation of daily life in suburbia. Yet its a step in a new direction both for the creative team and for movies a mature and humane comedy centered on a misanthropic female antihero. Think of it as ""Junos"" wicked stepsister. Charlize Theron plays Mavis Gary a divorced writer (or as she prefers it ""author"") of ""Sweet Valley High""-style teen novels. Though shes 37 Mavis never really graduated from high school. Her Minneapolis high-rise apartment has the depressing slumlike impermanence of a crash pad. Her social life consists of bad overnight hookups and lunches spent belittling former acquaintances with a catty former classmate who fled Mercury Minn. for the big (well biggish) city. At once haughty and insecure Mavis is a textbook case of arrested development. To top it off shes still obsessed with her former high school sweetheart Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). Her fixation flares when Buddys wife e-mails her an announcement welcoming their newborn child. Mavis launches a mission to rescue Buddy from the bondage of family life heedless of the fact that hes utterly content as a new dad. Equipped with an armory of makeup brushes falsies and lethal little black dresses she travels back to her hometown to reclaim her man. The comedy of awkwardness is honed to a stiletto edge. When two-faced Mavis in slinky cocktail attire seductively wheedles Buddy at a plaid-shirt sports bar shes as out of place as a black widow on a slice of apple pie. Looking on mockingly is Matt (Patton Oswalt) a wisecracking former classmate of Mavis and Buddys. Though hes physically disabled from a brutal high school bullying attack hes better adjusted than Mavis. As she pursues her romantic delusion to its bleak conclusion the two misfits strike up an unlikely friendship. In Matt Mavis discovers the one confidant who might have saved her from terminal self-absorption if only she had met him when she was still young enough to change. Phillip V. Caruso Paramount Pictures Charlize Theron in ""Young Adult."" Edgy subversive and hilariously embarrassing ""Young Adult"" undercuts the conventions of female-centered comedies at each turn. It manages to keep us invested in the story despite focusing almost every scene on a thoroughly unpleasant protagonist. The supporting characters provide the homespun humanity Mavis lacks especially Wilson as her Minnesota Nice former beau and Elizabeth Reaser as his fun-loving wife. Theron scores with a brave darkly amusing performance as a onetime alpha female who sees life passing her by. She smiles charmingly while shooting death rays from her eyes. In her scenes with Oswalt Theron drops her characters mean-girl bravado revealing the fear loneliness and confusion beneath her Revlon mask. ""Young Adults"" skepticism that Mavis can fan these flickers of self-awareness into a flame of understanding is a gauge of its sophistication. Cody and Reitman would rather close their film on a lifelike unresolved note than force its characters into a contrived happy ending. Audiences may not embrace Mavis immediately -- shes too spiky for that. But theres little doubt that in time shell join Marge Gunderson and Juno McGuff as another of Minnesotas enduring and iconic film characters.

At her rural Minnesota high school she was the prom queen and Superior Blond Being and clever enough to think she might become a famous writer. All the girls wanted to be her; all the boys wanted to bed her. Back then Mavis ran with that other species of teen royalty the jocks and had eyes only for stud athlete Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). Her celebrity myopia made a blur of the drones like pudgy Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt). Is high school a democracy? Is a monarch expected to notice every one of her subjects? Mavis had to keep her eye on the prize transporting her small-town luster to that most magical of all big cities Minneapolis and wowing important grownups who in their high school days might have been almost as beautiful as she. Now its nearly 20 years later and Mavis frustrated and angered by her life after high school is piquing late. Her marriage to some big-city boy ended in failure -- though as her mother reminds her ""The wedding wasnt a failure. Remember that tiramisu?"" Her dreams of literary success have curdled into a job ghostwriting the Waverly Prep series of young-adult romances whose self-absorbed heroine Kimberly Sutherland might be Mavis in her long-ago glory days. (""Sometimes in order to heal"" she writes in Kimberlys voice ""a few people have to get hurt."") She squats in her messy apartment watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians. How in the world did they achieve the fame that should have been hers? Mavis figures theres just one way to prove shes still the queen by going home and winning back Buddy. And if you tell her thats a long shot because he got married and stayed that way Mavis would say ""Your point?"" (LIST Top 10 Movies of 2011) By turns amusing and annoying Young Adult could be the flip side plus the sequel of Juno another film written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman. Youll recall that the pregnant teen played by Ellen Page was mature beyond her years. But at 37 Mavis is still a young adult stunted selfish believing her glamorous past is somehow her destiny. To grow up she will need a few face-slaps to her pride and perhaps a realignment of her ideas about the sort of man she should be with. (MORE Junos Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman Reunite for Young Adult) So maybe Matt the drone is Juno. Mavis doesnt recall him; he reminds her ""My locker was actually next to yours all four years."" Finally she recognizes him as ""the hate-crime guy"" Matt had been beaten and crippled by jocks exercising a more virulent version of the blithe bigotry Mavis showed him. ""They mangled my c--"" he tells her ""so I have to piss and come sideways for the rest of my life"" -- a line that instantly jolts Young Adult out of Romy and Michele comedy-nostalgia land and into the psychic-horror terrain of Jennifers Body another high school movie written by Cody. Except that in Young Adult the victim survives to haunt his pretty predator and perhaps to convince her that hes worth caring for. (MORE Jennifers Body Megan Fox Is a Man Eater) Reitman who also directed Thank You for Smoking and Up in the Air is aces at finding quirky humanity in the smallest of roles. When Mavis registers at her towns Hampton Inn she collides with a desk clerk played by Louisa Krause with a creaky-door voice and a naturally xenophobic suspicion of anyone as good-looking as this. Krause steals the scene in part because she expresses a view that moviegoers may share Mavis instead of looking puffy and lined as people do when theyre a couple of decades past their teen prime remains criminally gorgeous -- i.e. Theron. She would attract attention on Oscars red carpet (where Theron may well be next Feb. 24) let alone in a small-town sports bar where Mavis shows up at 6 p.m. encased in a low-cut vamp dress and a sarcophagus of makeup. She is a knockout; she is Mavis in her undiluted miraculously sustained teen radiance. (MORE Qamp;A with Patton Oswalt) She is here to rekindle the flame with Buddy played by Wilson as if Kevin Costner were a brand of sportswear that he bought off-rack. Mavis is sure that Buddy will once again be hers despite Matts skepticism. ""Love conquers all. Have you not seen The Graduate?"" she asks Matt (forgetting that at the end of that romantic comedy the reunited lovers stare blankly into the not-so-hot future). But Buddy hasnt bothered to shave for this ""date."" His lack of interest in an affair or an elopement is clear to everyone in the movie and the audience but somehow eludes Mavis. Back in the town she left so long ago she must imagine that nothing has changed and that no one including Buddy can resist her spell. Yet the only person still mesmerized by the Mavis legend is Mavis. Buddy has grown up. When she tells him ""There are so many things we have to say to each other"" he sensibly replies ""Well lets not say all of them."" (MORE Patton Oswalt in TIMEs 140 Best Twitter Feeds) So small and modest that it threatens to vanish while you watch it the movie has trouble deciding if Mavis is a heroine or a harridan and if shes at fault for living in the past or the townsfolk are wrong for resenting her attempts to dwell in remembered glory. So Cody gives Mavis both a big tell-off scene and a comeuppance. Toward the end Matts sister notices Mavis soiled appearance and asks ""Whats wrong with your dress?"" Mavis belatedly seeing the light replies ""I spilled my life on it."" (MORE Juno Review No False Notes) Whether Mavis is Codys vision of her teen self or a portrait of the bitch-goddesses she knew way back when Young Adult packs some ornery truths about compromise as the key to an arrested adolescents survival as an adult. In a thorny role Theron is splendid; she instinctively reveals everything Mavis doesnt know about herself and offers an intimate peek into a wayward soul.

In ""North Country"" she was a smudge-faced iron miner and single mother. In ""Monster"" she looked like the wrath of god as a foul-mouthed prostitute and serial killer and won an Oscar for her efforts. ""Young Adult"" is another story though. The movie itself directed by Jason Reitman from an original screenplay by Diablo Cody is a cockeyed comic triumph that flashes between bright and dark like a strobe light of the spirit. And Ms. Theron as Mavis Gary a self-styled author rather than a mere writer succeeds sensationally at something much harder than playing ravaged. Mavis was once prom-queen beautiful; these days in her late 30s she can still pull herself together to fairly dazzling effect. But she is also sly selfish nasty hurt and hurtful dryly sardonic and fatefully deluded. What makes her such a marvelous character is what seethes deep beneath her skin. Watch a clip from Charlize Therons latest film ""Young Adult"". Soon after her divorce a fiction writer returns to her home in small-town Minnesota looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend who is now married with kids. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. What makes the movie marvelous is the same combination that the filmmaker and writer brought to ""Juno""--unerringly subtle yet precise direction plus a literate script with dramatic energy and a delicate tone. (Mr. Reitman directed and co-wrote ""Up in the Air"" as well.) The movies title refers to the genre of books Mavis authors or more properly ghost-writes and to Mavis herself the suggestion being that she is young for her age. But young cant begin to describe her immaturity or her failure to flourish as an adult. When we first see her in Minneapolis a slattern in a junk-strewn apartment shes living on scraps of loveless sex drinking too much and picking up snatches of kids conversations here and there then dropping them into her chronicles of Kendall Strickland the teenage heroine of a series called Waverly Prep that is in fact headed for the dustbin of subliterary history. Suddenly though the blockage in Maviss life gives way to a bizarre breakthrough and she becomes a person possessed by a mission--reclaiming the love she lost when her high-school sweetheart got married. (Hes played by Patrick Wilson.) To find her old flame she goes off to her hometown in the company of her better half a yappy canine pipsqueak named Dolce. As she drives she listens to old tapes on the cars cassette player while we see the players innards whirring and spinning in macroscopic detail; outdated technology as an access route to the listeners past and an emblem of her stunted psyche. Its a clever flourish in a film with a distinctive look (Eric Steelberg was the cinematographer and Kevin Thompson designed the production) and an exceptional cast. Mr. Wilsons Buddy quite happily married with a new baby cant fathom what Mavis is up to--his puzzled decency is painfully charming--but shes as transparent as a wine-stained carafe to an old classmate named Matt Freehauf who is played to laconic perfection by Patton Oswalt. ENLARGE Charlize Theron in Young Adult. Paramount Pictures ""Guys like me were born loving women like you"" Matt tells her ruefully. They are two of a kind with a kinship in misfortune much of it self-inflicted Matt has used the small town as a refuge since high school when a misconstrued hate crime left him significantly but far from seriously disabled. They are also a classic comic pair in a production thats chockablock with vivid characters Elizabeth Reaser as Buddys wife Beth; Collette Wolfe as Matts sister Sandra; Louisa Krause as a droll motel desk clerk. Still the movie belongs to its star at every moment shes on screen. This is partly a function of Ms. Codys script which depends on a daring supposition--that audiences will invest their attention in a heroine who from the start confronts life with a toxic vibe. (I think they will once word gets out that Mavis is as funny and surprising as she is.) Its equally a tribute to Ms. Therons fearless reach and formidable range in a role that takes her from wry comedy into something perilously close to an American tragedy. By the end and against strong odds ""Young Adult"" gives us a grown woman to weep for. ENLARGE From left David Dencik Colin Firth Toby Jones John Hurt Gary Oldman and Ciaran Hinds in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Focus Features Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy The manifold pleasures of this remarkable film are cool but intense. And theyre intensely cool in the most modern sense when it comes to Gary Oldman as John le Carres master spy George Smiley who was portrayed in the classic 1979 BBC miniseries by Alec Guinness. This Smiley doesnt let out a word for the first 18 minutes; he simply takes everything in with his steady gaze and inscrutable mien. When he finally speaks its only to say hes retired. Thats his way of resisting an invitation he knows he cant refuse--to find the Soviet mole who has infiltrated the uppermost echelon of the Circus or the British Secret Intelligence Service. (Almost all of the suspects are guilty of something though only one of them has spilled all the beans.) Film Clip ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" Withholding Smileys voice is one of many intriguing games that the film plays in the course of a Cold War mystery about spies playing sinister games of treason and personal betrayal. Tomas Alfredson the Swedish director who brought new blood to the vampire genre with ""Let the Right One In"" proves to be an inspired choice for telling Le Carres convoluted tale in less than 40% of the original 324-minute running time. And he worked from an exemplary adaptation both lucid and succinct by the husband-and-wife team of Peter Straughan and the late Bridget OConnor. (Thats not to say that I understood every part of the plot; a certain amount of confusion comes with Le Carres territory.) Where the miniseries relied on brilliant acting and long spellbinding conversations in banal settings the feature film relies on a narrative structure that sometimes feels impressionistic--shorter scenes with fluid flashbacks--while putting its own collection of topnotch performers in settings that are quietly spectacular for their visual design and their muted colors. If I seem to be stressing form over content its because the movies form serves the content so well. ""Youre a good watcher"" one of the spies tells an earnest schoolboy. Mr. Alfredson and his cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (he shot ""Let the Right One In"") make good watchers of us all by seducing us with striking images trains moving slowly on parallel tracks in a marshaling yard; a baby nursing at its dead mothers breast; an airplane materializing out of nowhere on an isolated airstrip; an archives hivelike architecture. Even a visual joke becomes an exercise in compulsive watching. It follows Smileys visit to a veteran operative who keeps honeybees in his back yard. In a scene shot from the rear we see the two men and another operative driving away in a sleek Citroen sedan. But theres a bee inside the car and no way not to watch it flitting around until Smiley lowers a window to let it out. None of this would warrant watching of course if it werent for the cast that brings the drama to life. Some of the names--Colin Firth John Hurt--are better known than others while those others including Mark Strong Toby Jones Ciaran Hinds Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy are known for their excellence on the stage as well as the screen. Yet this version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" turns on the presence of Mr. Oldman and he is an actor of great experience and accomplishment who has finally found a film that fully deserves him. His voice so long and teasingly withheld resonates with warm regret in its lower registers--Smiley has no illusions about the role of virtue in spy craft--and with icy fury when he raises it against stupidity or deceit. His face is more often than not a mask which makes us grateful for every hint of a smile and amazed by the range of feelings he can imply without actually expressing them. Alec Guinness was a more assertive presence with a more mellifluous voice; his Smiley was also older bordering on elderly and quizzical bordering on owlish. Mr. Oldmans emphasis is on self-containment but what his Smiley seems to contain is all the wisdom of a blighted world. Corrections amp; Amplifications Collette Wolfe plays Matts sister Sandra in ""Young Adult."" An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Sandra was Matts wife. DVD Focus The Cider House Rules (1999) Charlize Theron is beautiful Candy beloved of Tobey Maguires young orphan Homer in Lasse Hallstroms entertaining and mysteriously moving version of John Irvings huge novel which the author adapted for the screen. The setting is an orphanage in 1940s Maine; the main theme is Homers search for home and family and his discovery of violence and love beyond his orphanages doors. Michael Caine is Wilbur Larch the loving ether-sniffing orphanage doctor who teaches Homer to practice obstetrics without a license. Oliver Stapleton did the luminous cinematography. The production was designed by David Gropman. The Italian Job (2003) In this jaunty remake of the 1969 original Charlize Theron gives a lovely performance as a safecracker named Stella who towers over three Mini Coopers used as getaway cars by a crew of high-tech thieves. (She drives one of them with impressive aplomb.) The movie directed by F. Gary Gray from a script by Donna Powers and Wayne Powers helped put BMWs remake of the old British Motor Mini on the map and it didnt hurt Ms. Theron either. Can it be coincidence that she drives a Mini in ""Young Adult""? Dracula (1992) Gary Oldman stars in the toothsome title role of what is also known as ""Bram Stokers Dracula"" or ""Francis Ford Coppolas Dracula""; the title variants may have been efforts to avoid litigation by Universal Studios which had laid claim to ownership of the title ""Dracula"" plain and simple.

Comments click to enlarge Young Adult Rated R  94 minutes  2011 Director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody who scored together with Juno (2007) reunite for this unfocused comedy about a dissolute writer in her late 30s (Charlize Theron) returning to her Minnesota hometown in hope of winning back her former high school sweetheart (Patrick Wilson) now a happy husband and father. The hard-drinking heroine has established herself in Minneapolis as a ghost writer of young-adult novels and for some reason the podunk townspeople rendered with a fair amount of contempt are mightily impressed by this. Whether the character is supposed to be a stand-in for Cody who grew up in the western burbs of Chicago and has since won an Oscar is more than I can say but the movie suffers from the sort of self-pitying fog that can envelop a writer when he dives into his own malaise.

Thackerays Becky Sharp has nothing on Mavis. Recently divorced and nearing meltdown big-city Mavis returns to her backwater Minnesota town to win back Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) the boy that got away. Pure YA stuff. One problem Buddy is married a new dad and not interested. Screenwriter Diablo Cody famed for YA-themed movies such as Juno and Jennifers Body has this territory down cold. And her gutsy script is note-perfect right down to Mavis addiction to the Kardashians Diet Coke and the fast-food dumps she visits with her laptop the better to steal bons mots from teens with. Jason Reitman (Juno Up in the Air) directs this tricky material - Mavis is someone you often want to throttle - with the ease and dexterity of a true pro. In this tale of stunted development Theron is a comic force of nature giving her character considerable density and humanity despite her monstrous aspects. And Patton Oswalt deserves cheers as Matt a former classmate who pops Mavis delusions with soul-crushing honesty. His dark duet with Theron is funny touching and vital. But fair warning The laughs in Young Adult leave bruises.

(Photo credit Courtesy of Paramount Pictures/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday December 8 2011 1200 PM Title Young Adult Film Info With Charlize Theron Patrick Wilson Patton Oswalt. A writer must confront what her life has become when she returns to her Minnesota hometown. Director Jason Reitman (133). PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters. If as the saying goes life is just like high school then Mavis Gary is at the head of the class. Shes thuddingly self-absorbed miserably possessive rude and constantly shoveling out insults to make up for her own insecurities. Oh and Mavis is 37 years old. Whatevs. But when first seen in Jason Reitmans perfectly observed black comedy ""Young Adult"" Mavis (Charlize Theron) is more of a lost soul than a hot chick (or mean girl). She oversleeps in her Minneapolis apartment nursing Diet Coke from a 2-liter bottle and avoiding an ugly truth Shes not who she thought shed be growing up in small-town Mercury Minn. The series of young-adult books that Mavis writes under a pen name is being canceled. Under pressure to deliver a final manuscript Mavis needs an escape and finds one when she gets a mass emailing from her ex-boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson) about a party for his new baby. Mavis has fixated on Buddy since they broke up in the early 90s but the fact that he has moved on wont keep her from heading to Mercury to restart the flame. The setup for ""Young Adult"" is old-movie 101 -- get a messed-up hero back to her roots -- yet Reitman has an organic astute feel for a certain kind of social smashup He likes what happens when jackasses are set loose among decent people. His theory as evidenced even more perfectly in ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Up in the Air"" is that its the decent people who wind up learning something. Theron sassily subtle and totally comfortable downplaying her beauty (except when she uses it as a weapon) is a hot mess. In a tricky turn -- one thats not at all similar to Cameron Diaz in ""Bad Teacher"" which this movies ads sadly recall -- Theron hints why Mavis despite proclamations of grownup success only got to the fourth rung of the ladder. And plunked on that first rung is Patton Oswalt in a terrific supporting turn as Matt a geeky high school classmate of Mavis. She may be stunted on the inside but his wounds are physical after he was severely beaten as a teenager by rabid jocks. Though funny Oswalt is far from comic relief; when Matt becomes Mavis drinking buddy they click because each is dealing with acidic overload. The script by Diablo Cody (who won an Oscar for Reitmans ""Juno"") runs out of gas in its final act after Mavis has a meltdown in front of Buddys cool wife (Elizabeth Reaser). But still the film has a feel for the way life ends up just hanging around. ""Young Adult"" may at times be stuck between emotional gears but thats by design. Like its heroine the movie refuses to pick up after itself. Magic Moment Mavis and Matt go to the woods where years before she lost her virginity and he lost his future.

"Young Adult movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Young Adult Charlize Theron flexes her mean-girl chops via Diablo Codys latest script -- 2 1/2 starsDecember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticCharlize Theron stars in ""Young Adult.""Its not easy being mean as Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Codys latest project ""Young Adult"" -- directed by her ""Juno"" collaborator Jason Reitman -- goes about illustrating with an intriguing unsettled blend of pity and pitilessness.Thirty-seven-year-old borderline alcoholic Mavis Gary handled with unsentimental aplomb by Charlize Theron may have left her hometown of Mercury Minn. for the exotic urban center of Minneapolis. But emotionally and psychologically shes still in high school honing her worst social instincts to a needle point. Ghost-writing young adult novels for a living Mavis is defined by what ""The Descendants"" author Kaui Hart Hemmings referred to when describing someone as having ""carried her juvenile meanness into her adult life.""The mission as Mavis sees it and is only too happy to accept is simple Return to Mercury wielding a dubious excuse (something about a real estate transaction); ignore her parents as long as possible; reconnect with her sweet-natured high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson); and bag him for keeps. Buddy is married (winning Elizabeth Reaser plays his enviable wife the special-ed teacher) and has a newborn. But Mavis knows what she wants.Narratively this is a simple tale hinging on the misfit-musketeers alliance of Mavis and an unpopular former classmate played with lovely tact and shrewd timing by Patton Oswalt. True to Codys darker comic instincts this character -- crippled for life by ""those jocks"" in a hate-crime incident back in high school -- is identified by Mavis as ""that hate-crime guy."" Later she gripes to her confidant with the crutches ""Could you walk any slower?""This is train-wreck human misbehavior all the way. You watch ""Young Adult"" horrified by Mavis delusions. Cody has created a role offering Theron a lot of room and plenty of casual venom.Yet Mavis isnt so different from the small-minded vampire seductress played by Megan Fox in ""Jennifers Body"" also written by Cody. The anti-heroine in ""Young Adult"" is held up for our voyeuristic amusement and finally our contempt. Her impulses are patly explained away by the carefully timed revelation of a painful secret. Theron nails the specifics of her character all the distress signals from the nervous hair-pulling to the relentless default sarcasm. I wish though Reitman (whose own instincts are to find ways to tenderize dislikable people or situations) had found a way to give ""Young Adult"" more of a motor. Codys a fast wit and ""Young Adult"" is not ""Juno"" which proves she can write in more than one key. Yet Cody would likely acknowledge shes working through her own contradictory feelings toward her protagonist -- and that she may have been a draft or two away from shaping those feelings into a terrific black comedy rather than a pretty interesting one.mjphillipstribune.comYoung Adult -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for language and some sexual content)Running time 134Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesJason Reitman and his posse of unlikablesDecember 8 2011Juno worthy of the heavens or OscarNovember 23 2007Juno star not your ordinary it girlDecember 9 2007Initial fumblings precede a prize pic in JunoDecember 14 2007Find More Stories AboutCharlize TheronJason ReitmanJunoDiablo CodyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1206-young-adult-20111208,0,7182522.column",200,youngadult28,youngadult,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Characters reminisce about the 90s wear Pixies T-shirts and maintain collections of hand-painted action figures in Young Adult all in line with what viewers might expect from a film that reunites Junos writer and director Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman. Whats different this time around? Theyre on the sidelines gazing with bewilderment dislike and/or awe at their heroine played by Charlize Theron as the type of girl who once upon a time walked all over them. Though her characters high-school glory days are almost two decades behind her shes dredged them up with an unstable determination that attests to the years of disappointment that followed them. Its an empathetic but bravely brittle portrait of an aging queen bee that showcases a nuanced performance from Theron as a woman too used to being admired to admit how lonely and desperate shes become. Theron heads back to her hometown of Mercury Minnesota to liberate her teenage flame (Patrick Wilson) from what shes sure is an unhappy marriage--never mind that he doesnt seem to think so and that hes a devoted new father. The ghostwriter of a once-successful YA series called Waverly Prep Theron is now divorced and an alcoholic and the film slowly layers on evidence of how close she is to a mental breakdown. Tromping through town on spike heels she takes up with an old bullied classmate (a very good Patton Oswalt) she barely remembers and doesnt treat much better as a grown-up; when he tells her ""guys like me are born loving women like you"" its with gloriously complicated ruefulness and self-mockery. Playing a character who crawls out of bed a wreck every morning and shellacs herself with salon treatments and makeup so shell look presentable by evening Theron conveys both the unthinking entitlement of the (once-) adored and a quavering vulnerability all too evident underneath. Its an impressive performance thats rarely showy and the restrained direction and screenplay offer it support at least until a rushed final act that places a screaming showdown and recovery too close together. But Reitman lets the pop-culture references (oh hi 4 Non Blondes ""Whats Up"") accessorize the story rather than guide it and in its uncompromising treatment of a character whos troubled but also a stone-cold bitch Young Adult offers compassion for rather than revenge on the ""psycho prom queen"" who has nothing left in life but a warped mix-tape from an ex who moved on long ago.

"Young Adult | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Young Adult Print Page Email Page Search Young Adult (2011; Rated ) A "" Charlize Theron delivers one of the most impressive performances of the year."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Young Adult(2011; R)In theaters Friday 9 December 2011Genre Comedy DramaCast Charlize Theron Patrick Wilson Patton Oswalt New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (7) Post a Comment  Horse Badortiessaid on Thursday December 29 2011 83718 PMThought Id put in my two cents. Unlike his father Reitman is rapidly becoming a genuine American auteur. No one working in Hollywood today gets the incipient loneliness and social malaise of post-modern America ""How we live today"" as it were. His last two films this one and Up in the Air totally nail all the odd comic elements of a society going joylessly through the motions - the sterility and formlessness of airport culture the soulless vapidity of small town life the weird highway ramp hotel non-culture successful people trapped in their own self-made defensive cocoons not to mention the perverse enjoyment of misery and depression fueled by endless booze and empty sex..Reitman is basically aiming his films at people who read things other that Twilight. He is drawn to writers like Walter Kirn and Diablo Cody because they seem to have something to say about the sad Way We Live Now that is not driven by research and age demos. The irony of Mavis the ultimate ""hip"" urban creature confessing that what she really wanted was to be a ""square"" and the defenses she erected to combat that failure is the sort of irony that would make people walk out I suppose. Give it up for Charlize totally fearless who gets something about the world we live in that should be explored. Like Carlin once said ""What are you gonna eat at Wendys and read USA Today till the end of time???"" I also was the only one laughing at lots of the lines. So what? These folks are playing to those select move goers who are too hip for the room. Dont those moviegoers deserve a few annual gifts in a world of creeping meatballism? But dont expect too many of these types of films a year..Just be thankful when they come along... Nobody knows anything William Goldman The Satire Fishsaid on Friday December 23 2011 32244 AMNL That was the point. You see this pathetic retch as the Matt Character points out and you root for her to change. Like Matt you are appalled by her thought process and goals for returning to town but you hope she will come to her senses. And at that critical tipping point where it looks she could have seen the error of her ways (SPOILER ALERT) she talks to the one absolute worst person she could talk to- the idolater fangirl who wants to be just like Mabel and the characters of her books and we as an audience dont see it coming. Such an innocent seeming person sends Mabel tumbling down into her own self pity again. Just like real life sometimes we are set up for a big life change and some comment from a random stranger delays that change sometimes indefinitely. I enjoyed rooting for her to change and when she doesnt Im heartbroken for her with a giggle of ""I didnt see that coming."" Sorry you didnt like the journey. Kevinsaid on Saturday December 17 2011 94712 PMNathan- I have to completely disagree. I just saw the film and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think Mavis does go through quite a bit of transformation; the fact that you can tell what the outcome of her endeavor will be within the first five minutes actually helps add more awkward tension and uneasiness through the film and the fact that not everything follows as you would predict helps keep it fresh. The relationship between Theron and Oswalt works really well especially considering he is the one person who refuses to take her crap; he has a legitimate reason to be where he is so he wont take her delusions of grandeur or her deceptive self-pity yet he can identify with her. Also what you point out in the third act is very sneakily shown in the first although it doesnt mean what we originally think it does; if it had been explicitly depicted then the reveal wouldnt have had nearly the impact it does particularly with one little detail in the earlier act. I think that you do end up rooting for Theron a little in the end and I dont think shes the same miserable jerk that she was at the start. It may seem on the surface that her thought process is the same but the approach to it is completely different; that tells everything. Joe Smithsaid on Saturday December 17 2011 70016 PMWorst movie I have seen all year. Jakesaid on Wednesday December 14 2011 10353 AMDo you think this has any chance at a Best Picture nomination? Kylesaid on Saturday December 10 2011 94538 PMNathan - I havent seen the film so I cant comment but I will say your criteria for judging a movie seems to be based off the fact that you as the viewer must root for the protagonist and/or they must always have a positive transformation by the end. I think youre wrong. I can list and Im sure Richard can list even more great films with hateful characters who dont change by the end of the movie. Nathan Ligonsaid on Thursday December 08 2011 15719 PMLook I love you Richard but I had to tell you how wrong you are here. I love Reitman and even named my weekly review show after Thank You For Smoking (show is Thank You For Watching). However this is the first movie he has made that is just plain bad. I have no idea how you or any other critic could possibly like this woman. She is sick sad pathetic delusional hateful and mean the entire film. The one point towards the end when you think she may be redeemed she goes right back to being a hateful jerk. Now I think Theron is great in this role and there were some good laughs between her and Oswalt but there is no depth to the writing. You know exactly what is going to happen in this movie within the first 5 minutes and you just wait for it to happen. The only surprise in the 3rd act is a history with Buddy (Wilson) that would have provided some depth to Therons character and maybe made her more sympathetic if we had known it earlier. There needed to be something in the writing here that made the audience root for Theron even though you know what she is doing is wrong. Daniel Plainview was evil itself but he was written in such a way that you could not help rooting for him. Mavis is none of that in this movie. She is a bad and dumb person in the beginning and there is no change to her when its over. There was probably no more futile piece of filmmaking this year. Nothing could have happened and you would have had the same outcome. Thats a good tag line for my review next week when it opens in my city. Young Adult is a complete and utter exercise in futility.

Everything obviously By Rex Reed  12/07/11 229pm Theron. Another triumphant performance by Charlize Theron informs and enhances the otherwise uneven Young Adult an edgy and sometimes disappointing drama about contemporary neuroses with comic undertones from director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody the team responsible for the surprise 2007 hit Juno. Its not in the same league as Mr. Reitmans hugely superior Up in the Air but Ms. Theron a true beauty and one of the screens most exquisite actors keeps the film airborne even when it seems dangerously earthbound. Shes a one-woman emergency rescue squad. Interesting no? I mean the way great-looking actors will do everything they can to hide their camera-ready perfection. In her ugliest transformation Ms. Theron disfigured herself to play lesbian serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003) and not only saved the movie but won herself an Oscar in the bargain. The success and praise must have rubbed off. In Young Adult she rarely wears makeup her hair is an unmade bed and the wardrobe looks like it came from a Black Friday sale at K-Mart. But she is mesmerizing as Mavis Gary an obsessive-compulsive ghost writer of the kind of bare-chested ""young adult"" pulp fiction they display in airport departure lounges who is so depressed she can barely crawl out of bed in the morning. Somehow Mavis manages to climb into her car and drive from her apartment in Minneapolis to her sad boring little home town of Mercury Minn. on a mission to restake her claim on an old high school boyfriend named Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) who is now married with a new baby. Mercury is one of those dead ends of Midwestern highway ambience well worth escaping--populated by Staples and Home Depots with a Taco Bell KFC and Chilis all in the same building--get the picture? So it is immediately obvious why Mavis left town although her ambition seems to have flat-lined immediately. Shes a deplorable flop in life (unhappily divorced no kids) and work. Even when she brags about her glamorous success as a novelist its a sham since her romance series has been canceled due to lack of interest and she doesnt know where her next paycheck is coming from. But shes hell-bent on recapturing whatever appeal she once had to seduce Buddy again oblivious to the fact that hes happily settled into the role of hick-town husband and father and scarcely even remembers her. After checking into a sterile room in a characterless Hampton Inn she finds his phone number and makes a date for old times sake. Oddly she also accidentally runs into--and ends up spending more time in the company of--a fat geek (Patton Oswalt) who has been crippled for life by a high school gay-bashing experience. When she finally meets Buddy hes a square who talks about changing diapers and adoring his wife who plays drums in a female rock band called Nipple Confusion. Nothing Mavis does to distract him from his creepy routine or besotted loyalty works but that does not deter her from saying all the wrong things going so far as to tell his wife ""Buddy used to sleep in T-shirts and boxer shorts--I still have some of them."" Treating Buddy to a round of tequila shots in a local bar she purrs ""I think thats the song that was playing the first time I went down on you."" As she proved with her controversial script for Juno Ms. Cody specializes in unusual characters who say unexpected things at their own peril. Even when she tries new nail polishes and hair styles Mavis looks bewildered in her desperate attempts to impress. She also gorges on junk food chug-a-lugs Makers Mark and feels awful. Shes a lonely confused melancholy 37-year-old mess clinging to the past to camouflage the fact that her present is lacking and the future looks even bleaker. Her career is a sham and the damaged Matt the lost soul she bonds with paints figurines of action-comics heroes in lieu of no career at all. The movie is about people whose lives have not worked out as hoped who never lived up to their potential and ended up pathetic adults. The results are not always rooted in logic. Going to bed together out of mutual boredom and misery does not ring true for either Mavis or Matt. Her relentless pursuit of a married man who shows no interest in her whatsoever is equally unimaginable. The screenplay is episodic and fragmented culminating in a hysterical party sequence where a drunken Mavis goes berserk on Buddys lawn in front of her parents his family and the entire neighborhood--a scene that is awesome and embarrassing for the audience as well as the neighbors. This is the stars big rave and the writers coup detat in which Mavis screams out the pain she has stifled for 20 years over the abortion of Buddys child. I loved the actress but didnt believe the character. Mavis is an emotionally undeveloped child-woman who does not relate to the time when women had obligations as women. Eschewing marriage motherhood manners and political correctness she has no obligations to herself either. This is the films biggest problem. The more she rejects inductive reasoning organized thinking and common sense the more she alienates the viewer and the less we care about her or what happens next. In the end she learns nothing redeemable about how to improve her life and I for one felt cheated. This is not a reason to miss Young Adult. Its a fatiguing low-key character study that drags along annoyingly and pleads for patience but stick with it and youll find the engrossing centerpiece performance by Ms. Theron a captivating reward that is well worth the effort. rreedobserver.com YOUNG ADULT Running Time 94 minutes Written by Diablo Cody Directed by Jason Reitman Starring Charlize Theron Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswalt 2/4 Comment Filed under Charlize Theron Diablo Cody Exes Jason Reitman Juno Lost Love movie Movie Review Old Flame Patrick Wilson Patton Oswalt Up in the Air Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/12/young-adult-review-rex-reed-charlize-theron-diablo-cody/,200,youngadult32,youngadult,observer

Caruso) A- Young Adult Starring Patton Oswalt Charlize Theron Patrick Wilson; Director Jason Reitman; Release Date Wide 12/16/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted December 16 2011 -- 1200 AM EST Anyone who ever survived small-town or suburban high school knows someone like Mavis Gary the thirtysomething psycho from hell -- I mean That Girl You Went to High School With -- played with breathtaking bravura by Charlize Theron in the one-of-a-kind comedy Young Adult. Mavis was that prom-queen-pretty popular stuck-up girl in your class who barely registered your existence. Mavis destined for success and so smug with her cute jock boyfriend thought she was all that and a bag of chips. And for a while in the years after graduation you heard that Mavis was leading a way cooler life than you were still stuck back in hometown wherever She was a published writer she had her own condo in the big city stuff like that. In fact Mavis life was secretly not cool at all Her city condo was a dump. She cranked out crappy unbylined young-adult (get it?) serial novels for a publishing factory -- and the series was being canceled. A brief marriage had failed Mavis drank too much and she was lonely with only her tote-bag-size Pomeranian for company. Hah Young Adult is an inspired collaboration between screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman -- and a natural follow-up to their great success with Juno. The movie concerns what Mavis -- petulantly fighting adulthood even at the enough already age of 37 -- does when she realizes that her life has already peaked and that high school was as good as it gets. What she does is she decides to drive from the big city (in this case Minneapolis) all the way back to her dinky disdained hometown (in this case fictional Mercury Minn.) to reclaim her high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson). Why? To prove she can. To have a do-over. Never mind that Buddy is happily married to Beth (Twilights Elizabeth Reaser) and a new father. Mavis figures that shes as sexy pretty and impossible to resist as she was when she wore Buddys team jacket and the two fooled around. Mavis figures that she can roll back time. Mavis is no kidding kind of crazy. And the one person who sees this clearly is one of those classmates she ignored completely back in the day Matt played with ferocious authenticity by the great actor-comedian Patton Oswalt (a regular on the Cody-created TV series United States of Tara). Matt lives in his own state of undescended adulthood physically damaged years ago when he was the victim of a brutal high school beating. The two are twisted soul mates and their relationship is one of the great startling pairings in American comedy. Wilson meanwhile happily assumes the blurred contours of an aging high school athlete while Collette Wolfe (who worked opposite Oswalt on the underrated risky comedy Observe and Report) scores in a ? couple of small important scenes as Matts sister Heres a stuck-in-Mercury alumna ? so disoriented by hatred of her own ? life and zip code (and so hopeless about bettering herself) that she worships every move Mavis makes. The queasy brilliance of Young Adult lies in the movies refusal to make Mavis so monstrously crazy that she poses no threat because shes obviously a cartoon -- and at the same time the filmmakers refusal to let Mavis off the hook at any time. The lady doesnt earn any hugging and learning moments as a reward for her humiliation. She remains irresistibly unlikable the horror of her lack of self-awareness inextricably tangled up with the pitch-black hilarity of her predicament. The really pretty Theron captures that state ?of really ugly inner childishness (articulated so sharply by Cody) with such precision it makes you want to hear stories of her own high school experience. It also makes you wonder how this singular movie got made -- Junos quirky dark material seems cutie-poo by comparison. Young Adult bumps along with nasty swerves middle finger proudly in the air toward an ending blessedly free of anything warm fuzzy or optimistic. Now thats adult entertainment. A?

"Young Adult | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; young-adult ) Young Adult (United States 2011) December 07 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Diablo Cody has a distinctive voice. You can hear it in Juno. You can hear it in Jennifers Body. You can hear it in United States of Tara. And you can hear it in Young Adult. After a while however the uniqueness of what Cody has to say and how she says it can grow tiresome. Juno was cheeky edgy and fun. It mixed humor and drama fantasy and reality love and sex in just the right mix. It was also the sole unqualified success on Codys still-growing resume. There was something about Juno that made it appealing. Some have wondered whether director Jason Reitman deserved more credit than he was given. Perhaps to test the theory Cody and Reitman have re-teamed (without Ellen Page) for Young Adult. On the surface it looks and sounds a lot like Juno. But theres a big difference in tone. Juno showed affection for its characters and the audience shared that love affair. In Young Adult the attitude toward the protagonist is thinly-veiled contempt. For most of the movie Cody and Reitman jape at her until in the last 20 minutes or so they attempt to turn her into an object of sympathy. It doesnt work and on balance neither does Young Adult. Its tricky business to make a movie in which the lead character is detestable. It can be done but it requires a deftness of touch not on display here. Reitman and Cody are trying for a black comedy but the screenplays numerous ""pithy"" lines arent all that funny and its ""insights"" are rather obvious especially the ""revelation"" of how lives shift in the reality of post-high school life. Geeks rule the world. Jocks often end up working minimum wage jobs. And popular girls get stuck with a couple of kids before they turn 25. For a reminder of this one would do better to listen to Bruce Springsteens ""Glory Days"" than sit through Young Adult. At the very least it would save about 90 minutes. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is the kind of character whos easy to despise. For most of the movie its unclear how the filmmakers feel about her. Is this Codys opportunity to take revenge on all the popular girls who looked down their noses at her in high school or is she attempting to humanize the caricature? By the end of the film we sense that she and Reitman feel sympathy - or at least pity - for Mavis but it doesnt translate to the audience. Any hope of our caring about what happens to Mavis is long gone. And she really hasnt changed. Shes the same psychotic delusional alcoholic bitch at minute 95 that she is at minute 1. Spending that much time in her company is more of a chore than slogging through the slime of sex addiction with Michael Fassbender in Shame. Mavis is 37 and divorced when she returns to her backwater Minnesota hometown from the big city of Minneapolis for one reason to recapture the love of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson). For some reason 20 years and one failed marriage later Mavis has decided that Buddy is her soul mate. Long after having shaken the small-town Midwestern dust from her shoes she holds her nose and comes back. Shes had some success while away as the ghost writer of a series of ""young adult"" books and as the author of teleplays for a once-popular TV program. Now however shes avoiding writing the final episode of the show and struggling with writers block. Her refuge is the alcoholic haze in which she almost constantly exists. Shes shallow petty and self-absorbed - otherwise shed realize that Buddy who is happily married to Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) and is a new parent has no interest in reviving anything with Mavis. While in town she enlists an old high school classmate Matt (Patton Oswalt) as her drinking buddy and confidante. Matt who was disabled as a result of an ugly run-in with high school bullies around 1990 is as anxious to forget about his teenage years as Mavis is to re-live them. One of the biggest mistakes made by the filmmakers may be to center Young Adult on Mavis who would be endurable in small doses. Its hard to fault Charlize Therons performance because it takes talent and dedication to make this kind of impression even if its strongly negative. Shes excellent at crafting a character we simply cannot stand and even manages to display the tragic aspect of Mavis life as we peer through the cracks (which are blown wide open in the final 15 minutes). The far more interesting and sympathetic character is Matt but Cody doesnt understand men as well as women and it shows in her writing. Oswalt has played non-comedic roles before (he was especially good in Big Fan) and his work here is strong. Patrick Wilsons Buddy lacks personality which is the point. ""Boring"" and ""settled"" define the character and Wilson delivers those traits. One wonders whether Codys screenplay says more about her than it does about the characters. Any distinctive voice that Reitman may possess has been dampened in service of the script. (See Up in the Air for a better sense of the director.) The lead character here is cut from a similar cloth to the one played by Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher and the result is the same artificial hijinks in service of an unlikeable over-the-top protagonist. Whatever magic resulted from the teaming of Cody and Reitman in Juno has not been recaptured here. In fact at times it seems theyre aware something is missing and are straining to find it. There are isolated instances when Young Adult strikes the right comedic and dramatic notes making a cogent point or delivering a solid laugh but its mostly a string of out-of-tune chords.

It was two-time Oscar-winning writer William Goldman after all who once supplied the supreme nugget of Hollywood wisdom ""Nobody knows anything.""Robert McKees lectures and seminars on story structure have made him rich to cite the most obvious example -- but McKee himself has never written a credited screenplay for a feature film and by his own admission is handing down elemental Aristotelian wisdom about narrative that was commonplace in the early days of Hollywood. His claim to have instructed at least 36 Oscar winners and 160-odd Emmy winners leads to a tautological retort Since virtually every aspiring screenwriter has taken his course or read his books thats not such an impressive ratio. Personally I suspect that imbibing cocktails at the Beverly Hills Hotels poolside bar leads to winning an Oscar -- I mean the correlation is amazing (Bonus essay question Is McKees real pop-culture legacy his formulaic approach to screenplay or his appearance as a character played by Brian Cox in ""Adaptation"" itself the career apogee of the ultimate anti-McKee screenwriter Charlie Kaufman?)A good screenplay it seems to me is a mysterious alchemical combination of ingredients both familiar and unfamiliar. There are almost no general rules about screenplays that apply across the board no matter what McKee or anyone else tells you. But if were talking about American movies aimed at a more or less mainstream audience they almost always involve the application of a highly idiosyncratic voice to a formulaic structure. That exact combination is what elevated Diablo Cody to celebrity status with her screenplay for ""Juno"" in 2007 along with the fact -- lets check reality here people -- that she was an attractive and funny ex-stripper female-type person in a field dominated by ugly hairy guys.I didnt love ""Juno"" overall but it was definitely crisp humorous unusual writing. What has happened to Cody since then is exactly what happens to every innovative screenwriter in the entertainment biz. She became a brand name and something close to a star in her own right someone who will get multiple chances to succeed or fail whether she writes crap or ""Great Expectations."" And she already stands out a whole lot less than she did at first because any number of other writers have figured out what shes doing and sought to imitate it to greater or lesser effect.While Cody was writing the Megan Fox megaflop ""Jennifers Body"" -- not as bad as its reputation perhaps but thats not much of an endorsement -- and crafting the TV series ""United States of Tara"" other writers have been cranking out Cody-like scripts loaded with self-aware overly verbose characters and post-Tarantino cultural shtick. She didnt write ""Horrible Bosses"" or ""The Change-Up"" or ""Crazy Stupid Love."" or ""Going the Distance"" or countless other bromancey rom-commy movies of the 2008-11 epoch but she might as well have. The Diablo virus has infected pretty much all of Hollywood comedy both in its XX and XY-chromosome varieties. I was about to say that Codys lone distinguishing characteristic at this point is the fact that shes a woman writing mercilessly about female characters but then I got a telegram from Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo over at the ""Bridesmaids II"" production office. (And I have to say it smelled kind of gross.)That brings us to ""Young Adult"" which stars Charlize Theron as a memorably mean and bitter character -- as it happens a frustrated drunken and slutty writer whose fame is not nearly what she wishes it were -- and reunites Cody with ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman presumably in hopes of rekindling their 2007 magic. And heres the thing If you didnt know going in that this was a Diablo Cody movie and hence was supposed to possess an extra frisson of wit or daring or edge or whatever I dont think it would ever strike you that way. Humor is notoriously subjective of course but I didnt find ""Young Adult"" especially funny. Its an intermittently engaging fable of American homecoming thats both intentionally and unintentionally awkward and flavored from bitter to sour all the way through. You Might Also Like Theron is terrific exuding a powerful black-hole sexual chemistry as the boozy unprincipled and profoundly unhappy Mavis Gary who has apparently graduated from being the belle of her rural Minnesota high school to ghostwriting a failing series of young-adult novels. She lives alone in a trashed Minneapolis high-rise apartment with her yappy little dog drinking too much and hammering prescription medication and wearing stick-on false boobs and waking up next to guys she doesnt know. Its a fearless performance but beyond sheer voyeurism Reitman and Cody never give us a reason to pay attention to Mavis let alone give three-quarters of a crap about what becomes of her.Mavis is way behind on a deadline and for muddled reasons becomes fixated on a long-ago boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson) who is still back in Mercury Minn. with a wife and a baby and a 21st-century version of the suburban lifestyle that seems half satirical and half idealized. As with a lot of ""Young Adult"" I can appreciate what Cody and Reitman are trying to get at here or at least what I think theyre trying to get at. Mavis may be flamin hot especially by the modest standards of Mercury but shes also rootless and utterly nuts not to mention completely incapable of noticing that Buddy and his low-key vaguely hip wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) feel sorry for her rather than in awe of her. But the story also feels schematic and unconvincing as if assembled from fragmentary Diablo Cody ideas What if the cutest girl from high school became a writer? And a delusional narcissist? What if her old boyfriend was completely insensible to her efforts to lure him back? (Has Cody discussed this scenario with any actual you know men?) And what if she hooked up with the most unlikely possible person from her past?That would not be Buddy who is attractive enough (if as dull as the Minnesota summer day is long) but rather Matt Freehauf a portly disabled loser whom Mavis claims not to remember even though they had adjacent lockers. Patton Oswalt gives the movies most heartfelt and generous performance by far but Matts character is also pushed beyond the point of grotesquerie. Hes still suffering from crippling and entirely too intimate injuries he received during a vicious high school gay-bashing (and no hes not even gay); he lives with his sister and spends his leisure hours mashing up action figures and repainting them. As he tells Mavis when she complains about someone calling her a zombie ""Im a fat nerd. I know what a zombie is."" But thats not even an especially funny joke and the whole idea that Mavis would be drawn to Matt -- because theyre both broken and desperate or whatever -- lies at the outermost vector of screenplay plausibility. There are plenty of sharp apercus and poignant character moments in ""Young Adult"" to be sure but its hard to tell where the movies awkward comic knife edge slides away into clunkiness. I never found Mavis relationships with Buddy and Beth and the rest of Mercurys inhabitants remotely convincing in human terms and as ""Young Adult"" went on I had to struggle ever harder to resist interpreting it as a severely messed-up work of self-analysis or autobiography.As a general rule Im delighted to encounter movies that resist the American tendency to deliver redemption or healing (or still worse instruction) in the final act; we all know damn well life doesnt work that way. But after staging a big and pretty satisfying all-character explosion Cody ends this story with a flat irresolute non-twist thats meant to be subversive but just feels mean and a little sick. Its one thing to write a black-comic tale about an utterly obnoxious character and quite another to make apologies for her and send her back to her despicable life leaving us profoundly grateful that we never have to spend time with her again.

Gorgeous but damaged conceited yet self-loathing Charlize Theron dares you to like her in ""Young Adult"" -- and the movie itself dares you to stick with an anti-heroine who makes no apologies for her deplorable behavior.Its an exciting thing to see this willful rejection of tidy character arcs and happy endings and it actually makes you wish ""Young Adult"" had been even further fleshed out and gone on a little longer. This is not something we say about a movie very often.In reteaming with ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman screenwriter Diablo Cody dials down the snark that marked the Oscar-winning script that made her a superstar in her own right. Shes actually created the anti-Juno in a lot of ways while managing to retain much of the directness the sharply-drawn characters and the casual poignancy that are her signatures.Therons Mavis Gary is as verbal as Juno MacGuff was but rather than finding the perfect clever quip at all times she usually manages to say the rudest most inappropriate thing. Rather than being mature and wise beyond her years shes in a state of arrested development emotionally stuck at the place where she peaked high school. Where she was the prom queen naturally. Theron continues to show her versatility hurling herself headlong into this unhinged character. There are shadings of Nicole Kidman in ""To Die For"" here; shell make you squirm but she may make you feel a little sorry for her too.Externally Mavis hasnt changed a bit since her glory days; shes still the statuesque blonde everyone worshipped and feared. But inside shes a disaster. Divorced she lives in a messy Minneapolis high-rise apartment with her neglected Pomeranian and writes a series of teen lit books called ""Waverley Prep"" clearly modeled after the revered ""Sweet Valley High"" which Cody herself has been working on turning into a film. The gig is about to end and Mavis is having trouble writing the final installment especially since she wakes up hung over every morning.One day she finds unexpected inspiration in a forwarded email. Seems her high-school sweetheart football player Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) and his wife fellow classmate Beth (Elizabeth Reaser) have announced the arrival of their baby girl. Mavis becomes obsessed with the notion that she and Buddy are meant to be together after all these years and returns home to pry him away from his family.In the vein of Alexander Payne Reitman finds just the right affectionately mocking tone in taking some jabs at small-town Midwestern life. Mercury Minn. is full of awfully decent folks who seem content with their quiet lives their fast-food chains their mediocre sports bar. The bland Buddy is one of them but nostalgia is a powerful thing so Mavis still views him as a golden god -- and the key to her happiness. Wilson plays on his ""prom king"" persona from ""Little Children"" but with a twist hes a little scruffy a little paunchy something we can see clearly but Mavis cant through her haze of delusion and bourbon.The other figure from high school who has an impact on her during her visit is the nerdy tubby Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) who dwelled on the opposite end of the social spectrum and like Mavis remains trapped there physically and emotionally. Matt suffered serious injuries back then when the jocks tried to gay-bash him (hes actually straight); 20 years later when Mavis runs into him at a bar she still refers to him as ""the hate-crime guy."" But he ends up calling her on her cruelty her insanity and the two form an unlikely bond in just a brief time.Oswalt may be best known for his stand-up comedy and his voice work in ""Ratatouille"" but hes excellent here in a more dramatic role as he was in the little-seen indie ""Big Fan"". Hes the heart of the film the anchor the voice of reason but theres nothing smug or self-righteous about him. Matt is as stunted as Mavis is which Oswalt conveys in subtle heartbreaking ways that always ring true.You come to care about his character so much youd like to see more of a resolution for him than ""Young Adult"" provides -- perhaps not a happy ending which is fine but at least another chapter.""Young Adult"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated R for language and some sexual content.

Hoberman Former Prom Queen Tries to Go Home Again in Young Adult Wednesday December 7 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Described as a ""psychotic prom-queen bitch"" the anti-heroine of Young Adult is a prize part that affords Charlize Theron one of the seasons prize performances--although to judge from the voting at the New York Film Critics Circle conclave last week few of my colleagues seem to agree.Perhaps its because Therons Mavis Gary a writer with attitude is a character too close for comfort. Theron established her bona fides and won an Oscar playing a serial killer in Monster; Young Adult directed by Jason Reitman from Diablo Codys screenplay allows the glamorous actress to take on another traditionally ""male"" role. Here shes something like the early-80s Bill Murray a slovenly spiteful self-absorbed snobbish smart-mouthed case of arrested development--the precise opposite of the maddeningly precocious little protagonist who gave her name to Reitman and Codys previous collaboration Juno.Indeed unlovable Mavis is pretty much the un-Juno--a 37-year-old Minneapolis-based writer (or ghost writer) of high school romance fiction as well as a divorcee and an alcoholic. While working on the last book in the series that has served as her sinecure as well as an alternate reality she is plunged into an existential crisis--if not temporary insanity--with the receipt of a mass e-mail announcing her high school boyfriend Buddys fatherhood. Leaving the previous nights date snoring in her bed she packs up and drives back to Mercury Minnesota while playing a vintage mixtape heavy on the Replacements.A woman on a mission to break up the boyfriends marriage and--who knows the precise fantasy?--maybe start anew Mavis cold-calls her ex (Patrick Wilson) then heads into a sluggish bar inhabited by an affable schlub (Patton Oswalt) who instantly recognizes her from high school and whom after a few drinks have blunted the edge of her hauteur she remembers as ""the hate crime guy""--a loser mutilated for life by a gang of jocks who imagined he was gay. Among other things they bond in their distaste for Maviss cousin--""the popular cripple"" whose automobile accident she complains ""totally ruined"" her sweet 16 party--as well as their shared adoration . . . for Mavis. Not for the last time does this mismatched pair of adolescent antipodes get hammered together.Mavis writes about high school and in essence she still lives there--eavesdropping on mall girls and incorporating their patois into her books and when needed her own drama. An extended lost weekend with intimations of Groundhog Day Young Adult has the former prom queen waking each morning from a drunken stupor to spend the afternoon dolling herself up for the evenings ""date"" with good-looking dumb bunny Buddy. These increasingly disastrous tete-a-tetes range from a drink at the local sports bar to a barroom performance by Nipple Confusion the all-femme amateur band in which Buddys good-natured wife (Elizabeth Reaser) bangs the drums--and to which Mavis shows up looking like Olivia Newton-John in the final scene of Grease--to the new babys naming ceremony a ritual seemingly attended by the whole town of Mercury including Maviss parents.Young Adult might be brushed off as curdled rom-com were it not for two things. The first is the depth of Therons performance. As outrageously mean dissolute bratty and delusional as Mavis becomes she never ceases to inspire sympathy--even when she demands it. The second less predictable aspect is the utter absence of the corny rehabilitation found in Juno and Reitmans glib downsizing dramedy Up in the Air. Mavis might hit bottom (or not) but theres no pot of small-town virtue at the end of this narrative rainbow. For all the revelations regarding the roots of her Mavis-ness the girls bitchiness remains intact. She is forever young. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

American comedies have spent the last few years exploring the idea of the man-child -- physically mature but mentally stuck somewhere between high school and adulthood. Now we meet his female counterpart and its not a pretty sight. So much the better Reteaming pop-savvy scribe Diablo Cody with ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman ""Young Adult"" revels in breaking the rules of safe Hollywood storytelling casting Charlize Theron as an emotionally stunted YA novelist with limited appeal and no tidy character arc. A B.O. gamble the deliberately prickly pic courageously risks offending audiences to arrive at a truth beyond its genres normal grasp. Cody has found herself in the media crosshairs after the overnight acclaim of ""Juno"" and though the snark-meister has managed to sustain her unique brand through a mix of Twitter updates Entertainment Weekly columns and edgy writing assignments (""Jennifers Body"" ""The United States of Tara"") ""Young Adult"" will surely be the make-it-or-break-it project in many peoples estimation of her talents. Rather than play it safe Cody spins a personal case of writers block -- possibly inspired by her gig adapting ""Sweet Valley High"" for screen -- into a deeply unflattering semi-autobiographical takedown of adult-onset insecurity and egotism inventing the story of a self-absorbed teen-lit novelist who returns home to rekindle things with the now-married boyfriend she dated in high school. Theron plays Mavis Gary -- beautiful successful and a mess. Mavis long ago achieved her goal of escaping the perceived oppression of small-town Mercury Minn. to live the dream in Minneapolis. So why is she so unhappy? ""Young Adult"" is hip to the answer but never preaches it outright When people can hardly stand to be around themselves they continue to run from and reinvent their lives until they address the fact that the root of their dissatisfaction lies within. Though Mavis is undoubtedly fashioned from aspects of her creators own personality the operating idea here seems to be that people dont change. The high-school queen bee will always be insufferable and her fitting punishment will be having to live with herself -- which is precisely Mavis situation when the film opens divorced and getting by on TV dinners and one-night stands in a dumpy caricature of her cosmopolitan ideal. In such straits an innocuous email announcing the birth of her old flames baby is all it takes to send Mavis mind back to the glory days when she and football star Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson reprising his laid-back ""prom king"" aura from ""Little Children"") were the schools cutest couple. On the surface ""Young Adult"" is about Mavis delusional quest to steal her former beau away from new wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser in a sly supporting turn). Deeper down the film engages with the concept of maturity in a culture that celebrates such youthful ideals as beauty and instant gratification. In Mavis case writing pulp melodramas for the Noxzema set encourages her to stay stuck in an adolescent mindset. However since comedy is tragedy that happens to other people the film easily plays as satire following in the same vein as Alexander Paynes shrewdly observant gently condescending Midwestern portraits featuring character moments so true one cant help but laugh in pained recognition. While Cody settles on a less singular yet still piquant voice for her contempo characters than the one heard in ""Juno"" Reitman and his cast expertly manage the films tricky tone. Even so ""Young Adult"" seems content to remain small retreating from Mavis climactic moment of catharsis to deliver an ending that breaks yet another long-standing Hollywood rule as the flawed heroine stares self-realization in the face and consciously decides not to learn from her experience. In a film intent on authenticity its no coincidence that Mavis seems to be surrounded by inane reality-TV programming. Real life is messier than that as demonstrated by the films most sympathetic character a former classmate named Matt Freehauf who was crippled by the cool kids during a miscalculated gay-bashing incident. In a poignant career-redefining performance by comedian Patton Oswalt Matt has every right to be resentful and yet hes coped with his adolescent issues better than Mavis. Mavis by contrast comes across like a vampire straight out of one of the supernatural YA book series so popular these days. Shying away from the sun she eavesdrops on real teens for story ideas and stalks Buddy and his new family oblivious to the damage shes capable of inflicting on others. For Theron this represents a different kind of performance from ""Monster"" and ""North Country"" for which she won plaudits while allowing herself to look superficially unattractive. Here the actress plays closer to home inviting auds to observe the process by which she makes herself beautiful painting on makeup clipping her nails and attaching hair extensions to disguise her physical flaws. But the scowl etched on her face reveals the ugliness within demonstrating a naked candor -- one that extends to the screenplay itself -- thats plenty admirable in part because its so squirm-inducing to behold.

Accepting a tribute at the Gotham Awards last week she singled out Jason Reitman director of ""Young Adult."" She didnt mince words ""Jason"" she said ""thank you for letting me play such a bitch."" Reitman wasnt crazy about the assessment. During a public conversation before a screening of the film at the 92Y he said that the actress must have been joking but that her denouement nonetheless ""cheapens the character."" Thats a curious stab at political correctness for a director married to the idea of politically incorrect filmmaking an avowed libertarian whose ideology lingers in each of his four features. But lets assume hes just covering himself and take Theron at her word -- or whatever word is preferable to the unseemly one she chose. ""Young Adult"" certainly emphasizes its protagonists underwhelming qualities. There are glimmers of dark brilliance in this rough assessment of a woman out of synch with the world around her; indeed the movie falls short only by not following its disgruntled heroine far enough off the deep end. Reitman and his ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody introduce Mavis Gary as a Minneapolis-based ghostwriter and lonely divorcee who often starts her days after a hard night removing the previous evenings falsies and chugging soda from the bottle. The story chronicles her attempt to break this cycle; of course she makes things worse. Much of the movie revolves around Mavis return to her drab suburban hometown Mercury in a misguided attempt to win back her now-married and settled high school sweetheart (a bland Patrick Wilson). Its a lost cause from the outset destined to implode at any moment. While she finds counsel with the irascible Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt perfectly cast) the portly classmate Mavis forgot that she used to bully in high school she ignores his advice to move on. With self destruction as destiny Reitman has made the equivalent of a Roland Emmerich disaster movie writ small an apocalyptic scenario internalized by a single person. He intends the movie as he has stated in interviews to place viewers in a state of incredible uneasiness by inhabiting Mavis screwy perspective in all its unflattering glory. However the movie amounts to a restrained unadventurous experience. The nervous comedy has nothing on numerous other recent projects and characters designed with comparable intentions The mumbling door-to-door salesman of Ronald Bronsteins ""Frownland"" Bobcat Goldthwaits dog-fellating protagonist in ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" Alex Ross Perrys still-unreleased sibling-rivalry-roadtrip ""The Color Wheel"" the sexually misguided stars of the Danish TV series (and hilarious feature-length adaptation) ""Klown"" or your average episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" By comparison ""Young Adult"" makes discomfort seem glamorous. Although Mavis is in every scene of ""Young Adult"" its filmmakers dont relate to her. In fact not unlike Ryan Bingham in Reitmans ""Up in the Air"" society punishes Mavis for evading domesticity. I mean that literally In the final confrontation her Mercury Minn. peers stare her down and reject her disgruntled ways in a scene that recalls the climax of ""The Wicker Man."" When Mavis doesnt face punishment her fury infuses ""Young Adult"" with a naughty energy. The strongest scenes involve her unlikely chemistry with the portly Matt an equally dissatisfied -- and rejected -- thirtysomething still crippled from his time as a high school outcast. But in this regard ""Young Adult"" is little more than a watered-down version of ""The Color Wheel"" a black-and-white odyssey in which director Perry and his co-star Carlen Altman play an obnoxious borderline loathsome brother-and-sister pair only truly capable of relating to each other. Almans character has much in common with Mavis although she brings more transparency to her passive-aggressiveness and her brother makes things worse. Despite their constant squabbling they find a bizarre kind of solace in each other. Perry takes them to a beautifully subversive happy ending. By contrast ""Young Adult"" only toys with the possibility of a twisted resolution to Mavis plight; its a cautionary tale for bitter people. This is Reitmans tamest work and his most controlled with a cringe factor that only scrapes the surface. Awkward comedy makes us recoil in terror because it bears a strong resemblance to feelings we experience in real life providing a new context that endows it with humor. (You know how terrible mistakes become funny years down the line? Movies can speed up that process to milliseconds.) But Cody and Reitman dont much like Mavis or at least fail to make her sympathetic enough for her miscalculations to feel like anything more than a rascally bachelorette receiving her comeuppance. Theres surely a better word for Mavis than ""bitch"" but Theron had the right idea. criticWIRE grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Paramount has been slowly building buzz around the movie with ""secret screenings"" around the country the promise of a Cody-Reitman team-up along with interest in Therons performance should put the movie on peoples radars for opening weekend. But mixed word-of-mouth and an unlikable protagonist will likely prevent it from doing much business beyond that and may hamper its awards season prospects as well.

It helped me understand the complexities of the movie. Reply Ashton May 12 2016 419 pm Mixed word of mouth? Are you crazy? This film has been getting NOTHING but raves. Even The Playlist awarded it an A minus. This is the first review Ive read where it has gotten something less than an A-. You may want to rethink your issues with this film because a majority of the things you stated arent in fact true. ""But Cody and Reitman dont much like Mavis or at least fail to make her sympathetic enough for her miscalculations to feel like anything more than a rascally bachelorette receiving her comeuppance. Theres surely a better word for Mavis than ""bitch"" but Theron had the right idea."" ^^ That right there doesnt add up. Mavis doesnt need a resolution- she doesnt need to appear sympathetic by the third act... shes an asshole and in the words of Diablo Cody herself ""Assholes dont change."" Mavis isnt going to have some sort of revelatory moment and become a more likeable protagonist. Thats what makes this film so different from the millions of other ""dark-comedies"" that have littered theaters. Its a comedy without compromise. Reply Barry May 12 2016 419 pm I think I need to chceck out The Color Wheel.

Reply Steven Nash May 12 2016 419 pm I think the specificity and eloquence of this review not only evocatively reveals the writers take on the film it also effectively puts it in context with films with thematic similarities. The result is this reader gained deeper understanding of filmmaking story structure. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Caruso/Paramount Pictures More like a snapshot than a full canvas the tart abrasive character study features strong performances from Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt. TWITTER Director Jason Reitman reunites with ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody in well acted but narrowly conceived story about a deluded author of teen novels who plots to win back her high school boyfriend. A tart abrasive character study of a seriously messed up writer who pens a twisted new episode to her own life the pungent Young Adult feels like a chapter in what by rights should be a longer film or novel. As if deliberately setting out to make something less warm and friendly than his genial first three features Jason Reitman reunites here with his Juno cohort Diablo Cody on a smartly observed well acted but narrowly conceived story about a deluded author of teen novels who plots to win back her high school boyfriend whos now a happily married dad. Deftly done in every respect this Paramount release which oddly bypassed the fall festival circuit is much closer in feel to an indie-style film than to a major studio production making it a curious choice for a Christmas launch. Okay commercial results look likely. PHOTOS THR Actress Roundtable With Charlize Theron Michelle Williams Entirely avoiding the sort of trademark showy dialogue that made her name on Juno Cody most distinguishes herself here by creating two unusual characters of a kind rarely seen front and center in a mainstream film. The first is Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) a stunning woman who will be 40 before long still hasnt gotten her life together and would be considered by most reckonings a condescending first-class bitch. Living alone in a messy high-rise apartment in downtown Minneapolis Mavis has been ghostwriting entries for an adolescent novel series for years although this looks to be winding down. Shes a divorcee who can get guys when she wants but when the excuse arrives to return to her small Minnesota hometown she concocts a scheme to reclaim the glory that was hers as a teenager by luring away her high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson) no matter that the first time she sees him on her visit hes got a breast milk pump in hand. PHOTOS Charlize Theron Patton Oswalt on the Gotham Awards Red Carpet Dolled up or not Mavis is still a knockout perceived by locals as a glamorous success who hasnt changed at all since school days. She loathes the banality of the town and part of the early-stage humor stems from the dressed-to-kill Mavis having to frequent chicken-and-ribs-type sports bar restaurants the best the town has to offer. Despite her relative worldliness Mavis is still an emotionally immature adolescent with teenage priorities prejudices and fantasies. The second character of note even more unusual is Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) a former high school classmate to whom she says upon encountering him in a bar ""Youre the hate crime guy"" A caustic sad sack with a chip on his shoulder as large as Mavis sense of superiority Matt relates how he was bullied and ultimately beaten up and left for dead by a bunch of jocks because they thought he was gay. The irony he says is that he isnt gay but since then he hasnt been good for much of anything in that hes permanently crippled and bent out of shape physically and mentally. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of the THR Actress Roundtable Here then are the polar opposites of the high school experience the babe with the highest self-esteem and the shlub with the lowest both of whom remain emotionally stunted basically where they were 20 years before. Such characters -- the snooty mean queen and the razzed geek -- are staples of teen pictures but are rarely seen as older people still carrying the same baggage. These two had nothing in common back then but now can really talk because they get one another and are willing to be frank; he calls her on her b.s. and she accuses him of using his disabilities as an excuse for doing nothing. Their scenes together are the films best with Theron and Oswalt who have very different tempi and temperatures as performers parrying and thrusting with great expertise. The way Mavis behaves with Buddy somebody should dub her shameless Mavis. Meeting his nice wife Beth (Elisabeth Reaser) Mavis goes on about how she and Buddy used to be together; alone with him she recalls how great things were in the old days and acts as though theres no reason why they shouldnt pick up where they left off. Buddy just sort of smiles uncomfortably through it all to be nice which only leaves the door wider open for Mavis to keep pushing her increasingly misguided agenda. PHOTOS THR Director Roundtable With Jason Reitman Alexander Payne Aggravating an already bad situation is her alcoholism. ""Do you want to get loaded or something?"" Mavis demands of Matt after one of her ""dates"" with Buddy which is par for the course with her. There have undoubtedly been many times in the past when men have been very happy to hear her say something like this and theres no question shes lively provocative company when shes had a couple of belts. But Mavis doesnt know when to stop so its only after she completely embarrasses herself in a petulant self-pitying public rant that she has something like an epiphany that might help point the way for her to move forward. On a scene-by-scene basis Young Adult entirely engages with its smart exchanges between characters who are well equipped with rough edges and raw nerves. Mavis and Matt undergo some key life changes as well providing some dramatic movement. But the plot such as it is has a very short arc and almost exclusively consists of charting Maviss strategy for luring Buddy back; there are no subplots or side excursions just the surprising bonding that occurs between Mavis and Matt. The result is an impression of vibrant character sketches rather than of full-bodied drama with depth and complexity of two characters specifically who could easily warrant far more extensive treatment so acutely and specifically drawn are they. Of the supporting characters the only particularly interesting one is Matts sister Sandra (a very good Collette Wolfe) a plain woman who living with her brother has no life has always idolized Mavis and inadvertently makes some comments that alter the course of things. Jumping into the deep end with an essentially unlikeable character who is nonetheless compelling and sometimes great fun to watch Theron is terrific. She makes Mavis arrogance and certainty of her own allure not only convincing but enjoyable. When her behavior becomes pathetic and pitiable however theres no feeling of deserved comeuppance just relief that going too far will finally provoke her to pull herself together. Oswalt the stand-up comic who was excellent in Big Fan two years back excels again here exposing just enough of Matts life of hurt under his bracingly jaundiced gab. Neither the script nor Wilson provides much insight into how Buddy really feels (or felt) about Mavis a woman whose literary exercises and life experiences have blurred in ways quite likely helpful to neither. Young Adult which has been directed with acute insight by Reitman with heightened attention to the way people behave when theyre alone is good as far as it goes but it feels more like a snapshot that a full canvas a weekend jaunt rather than a real journey.
