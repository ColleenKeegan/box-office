"Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-CirqueMOVIE REVIEW Cirque du Freak The Vampires AssistantOctober 23 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC In the bizarre world of ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" theres a war brewing over how to put this simply ""portion"" control. It seems the truce between those who sip leaving humans a little weaker but none the wiser and those who guzzle gluttons who leave death destruction and no tip behind has been on hold for a couple hundred years.But those peaceful days are about to end in Paul Weitzs stab at vampire camp in ""Cirque du Freak"" a not quite deadly adaptation of the frothy fanged kids book series by Darren Shan. Interestingly the lead character is a 16-year-old named Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia). Coincidence? I think not.Darrens a good kid makes good grades and seems to be taking a pass on the whole teen rebellion thing except for his delinquent best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson). That is until the Cirque comes to town (cue ominous music).Despite being told not to go come evening Darren and Steve are there claiming to be 21. How 16 is that?Theres a good mix of appropriately gross freaks from minor aberrations like Snake Boy (Patrick Fugit) who seems to have nothing more than a bad case of green psoriasis to major freakishness like Corma Limbs (Jane Krakowski) who can regenerate body parts which comes in handy when theres an angry werewolf around. But the real discovery of the night is Crepsley (John C. Reilly) and his performing pet spider a big bright red and blue poisonous plush one named Octa who blinks bites and bounces around trying her best to look lethal.Now heres the weird thing Darren really likes spiders and Steve is obsessed with vampires and hes sure that Crepsley is one. Have they come to the right place or what? Soon theres an Octa heist a bad spider bite some DNA testing by a nasty fat man named Mr. Tiny (Michael Cerveris) and Darrens having to make a really major life decision -- like should he become a half-vampire to get the spider-dote for Steve and fool his family into thinking hes dead? The answer my friends is yes a quick death and a very long life are definitely in the cards for Darren.The themes in ""Cirque"" are typical teenage ones -- feeling like a freak unsure of who you are or what you want to be in life ready to fall in love kinda especially when the monkey girl (Jessica Carlson) is so cute and falling out with your best friend.This is usually Weitzs sweet spot having written ""About a Boy"" with such a lovely blend of sentiment and humor and ""In Good Company"" an underrated relationship comedy starring Topher Grace which he both wrote and directed. So its a disappointment that ""Cirque"" isnt better.The look of the film has a great eerie Victorian storybook quality to it. The story and characters are mostly sized for the 8- to 10-year-old crowd. The action -- a lot of rough vampire-versus-vampaneze (the killer vamps) fighting which entails limb tearing head butting and spilled blood -- aims a little older. Meanwhile the dialogue is shooting for something akin to the campy cleverness of ""Scream.""Unfortunately Weitz cant quite get a handle on what the film should be despite teaming up with the talented Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") on the script. ""Cirque"" is a harmless bit of fluff with a very cool look but theres just never enough bite.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--Cirque du Freak The Vampires AssistantMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action disturbing images thematic elements and some languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIn their lairs  Vampires have become a big part of the...November 15 2009In strange company Paul Weitzs Cirque du FreakSeptember 13 2009No girls allowed in this book clubNovember 19 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTCirqueVampireSpiderCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cirque23-2009oct23,0,6044435.story",200,cirquedufreakthevampire'sassistant1,cirquedufreakthevampire'sassistant,latimes

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.) These freaks deserve better Add to ... Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 22 2009 311PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Directed by Paul Weitz Written by Paul Weitz and Brian Helgeland Starring Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson John C. Reilly Ken Watanabe Willem Dafoe and Salma Hayek Classification PG Theres a quiet knowing interlude in Zombieland in which the films heroes weary from battling the undead exchange wounded sighs. ""Zombieland is difficult"" one says. ""Growing up is difficult"" the other responds. In other words growing up is Zombieland an idea that took hold in pop culture back when Buffy the Vampire Slayer enrolled in Sunnydale High on TV in 1997. Since Buffy  variations of the adolescence-is-a-freak-show theme have appeared in Harry PotterSpidermanX-Men and Twilight . Now theres Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant  the story of a slightly boring straight-A high school student Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia). Were never convinced that Darren is the perfect preppie however. And when his friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson) asks if he wants to ditch homework and take in a travelling carnival Darren is right there. Soon theyre both digging the bosomy bearded lady (Salma Hayek) and her boyfriend Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) a 200-year-old vampire going through a midlife crisis. Crepsley needs an assistant someone to do errands and help him battle the Vampire tribes archrivals the relentless Vampaneze. Before long Darren leaves home and high school to work for Crepsley making shy romantic overtures at a girl (Jessica Carlson) with a bullwhip tail coiled in the back of her pants. Cirque du Freak spends too much time gawking at what it sees as sideshow attractions. At one point the girl advises Darren not to judge people by the colour of their scales or length of their tail. ""Its not about what you are but who you are"" she says. Thats a fine thought but the film never follows that advice. We never get under the skin of anyone here. Freaks never become characters. Theyre objects of derision. Its not even clear why actors like Willem Dafoe and Orlando Jones are in the movie. Perhaps theyll get something to do in Cirque du Freaks s planned sequel. Will a sequel will ever get shot? Cirque du Freaks doesnt have the feel of a franchise-maker. Except for Hayek theres nothing to ooh or ahh at here. No big CGI scenes for us to marvel at. Reilly decked out in an orange Beethoven fright wig makes a droll sashaying vampire but the teenage players are a drab lot. Even the endless fight scenes between the Vampires and Vampeneze lack punch. More than anything the film lacks a rapport with its audience. Buffy  Twilight and the best Harry Potters were alert to the fears and suppressed longings of adolescents. Slayers vampires and wizards - freaks - were viewed with humour and sympathy. In the latest neck-biter from Universal freak is an unfriendly catcall.

Comments click to enlarge Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Recommended 2009 Two teenage pals turn into vampires and prove too cool for school in this rousing adaptation of Darren Shans popular young-adult novels. Hell-raising Josh Hutcherson ropes amiable buddy Chris Massoglia into attending a freak show and they meet a wisecracking bloodsucker (John C. Reilly terrific) who pulls them into a war between the vampires and their ruthless cousins the vampaneze. Mixing horror and comedy while minimizing the gore writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) serves up a witty adventure fantasy with a tasty dollop of schadenfreude.

Reilly) . After Crepsley turns him into one of the undead Darren joins the traveling sideshow and its parade of weird and monstrous creatures. Starring John C. Reilly Chris Massoglia Jessica Carlson Michael Cerveris Patrick Fugit Salma Hayek Director Paul Weitz Running time 149 Release Opened Oct 23 2009  Editorial Review Trading on the vampire genreBy Desson ThomsonFriday Oct. 23 2009Theyre everywhere. Vampires. In movies such as ""Twilight"" and TV series such as ""True Blood."" And in young adult books. ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" is culled from Darren Shans four -- count em four -- trilogies about a 16-year-old boy (Darren) who becomes the involuntary assistant of a vampire known as Larten Crepsley.And you like the rest of the consumer lambs are drawn to it all and might be again drawn to ""Cirque"" a movie that pulls two teenage boys deep into a world of vampires killer spiders bearded ladies and weird little guys in dark shawls who look like young cousins of Gollum/Smeagol from ""The Lord of the Rings.""This movie is going to test you. The movies collection of fanciful names such as Evra the Snake Boy and Rhamus Twobellies will make you think of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" The film flows over with F/X phenomena from ""flitting"" vampires to the beard that forms faster than you can say ""So easy a caveman can do it"" on Salma Hayeks chin.Hayek plays a bearded lady part of the circus show that gets the story rolling. When tickets to Cirque du Freak fall into the hands of 16-year-old best pals Darren (Chris Massoglia) and Steve (Josh Hutcherson) they decide to check it out. After watching a big-top parade of snake people monkey-tailed girls and double-bellied guys they become fascinated with Crepsley (John C. Reilly) a performer who puts on a great show with his oversize poisonous spider Madame Octa.Steve a vampire fanboy believes Crepsley may be a vampire he recognizes from his comic books. And Darren whos crazy for spiders wants to kidnap Octa. Darrens theft of the spider leads to his becoming a vampire. When Octa bites Steve Darren is forced to offer himself as an assistant to Crepsley who has the only antidote that can save Steves life. In short order both boys become embroiled in an ongoing war between vamps (who draw just a little blood from humans) and vampaneeze (who drink em and kill em). And with each other.As a story the movie directed by Paul (""American Pie"") Weitz wanders episodically all over the place. It seems to have been scripted by the impulses of someone whos checking out the various narrative tunnels of a video game. Is it about the friendship between Darren and Steve? Is it about the relationship between Darren and Crepsley? Is it just a banal extravaganza designed to appeal to an ADD audience? Or was it a make-work project for stars such as Willem Dafoe and Ken Watanabe whose peripheral roles dont add much to the drama?""Cirque du Freak"" has its moments of fun many of them having to do with Reillys deadpan comic style. But the movie lacks the original edge of its better predecessors. While it celebrates the creative and the imagined and introduces us to colorful characters its bland and dull. If serious hard-core vampire movies for adults are the equivalent of spicy bloody marys think of ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" as a watered-down Shirley Temple. Glug it down and after the sugar rush little sense of fulfillment filters through your system.Thomson is a freelance reviewer.Contains mild profanity supernatural violence and disturbing images.

Reilly as an aging vampire running a macabre show. Cirque du Freak Thec"" calls to mind Grandpa taking out his dentures and trying to put on a comedy monster show for little kids at Halloween When he tries to be scary hes goofy but when he tries to be goofy hes scary. An inept fantasy that wants to be a sort of hip Goth legend the movie tries to build an increasingly cosmic rivalry between two high school friends. Josh Hutcherson of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is the naughty boy drawn to the dark side. As the pure-hearted hero who is his opposite number Chris Massoglia who sports a fluffy mid-1980s Ralph Macchio haircut maintains such a slack-jawed blankness throughout that he makes Ashton Kutcher look like Marlon Brando. After the pair stumble on a freak/monster show in which the star is an aging vampire (John C. Reilly sporting Ronald McDonald hair and the kind of floor-length coat Prince used to wear) they get wrapped up in a vaguely defined struggle between (well-behaved) vampires and (dastardly) ""vampaneze."" As part of initiating good kid Darren the vampire fakes the lads death which leaves his parents bereft as the kid happily plays video games inside his coffin. Like many other scenes this one fails to even establish whether its meant to be cool black comedy for fans of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Beetlejuice."" If so why show the parents grieving? Anyway the special effects scenes and the overwrought acting seem pitched at 5-year-olds. So is the dialogue. Jokes run along the lines of ""Youd think a vampire would know better than to stick his neck out."" Spirited away with his vampire mentor to live in a freak camp Darren meets such creatures as a bearded woman (Salma Hayek) whose whiskers grow when she gets turned on and an alt-rocker (Patrick Fugit) who is a snake boy. Indie rockers with an evil streak turned out to be a rich source of jokes in this falls ""Jennifers Body"" but this movie cant figure out what to do with this idea or with the spaghetti bowl of other characters and story lines. Assorted allies and bad guys (""Mr. Tiny"" ""Murtaugh"" ""Mr. Tall"") stumble around spouting exposition as not much happens. Even the climactic battle amounts to some desultory fist-fighting. The movie based on a series of books and meant to set up sequels is going to disappear faster than a vampire in daylight. Its directed by Paul Weitz whose brother Chris similarly bungled a shot at creating a fantasy franchise with ""The Golden Compass."" Maybe these guys should go back to making reality-based comedies. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bon Jovi gives Jersey a good name Read Next Bon Jovi gives Jersey a good name Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46534 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22434 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 17212 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Do we really need another vampire movie? Well this one is based on a popular tweener series of a dozen books by British writer Darren Shan. Director and co-writer Paul Weitz claims he loves the series and Weitzs credits -- he and his brother Chris Weitz gave us American Pie and About a Boy -- got my attention. But the mess onscreen does no one any favors. The Cirque du Freak itself has flavor with sexy Salma Hayek as the bearded lady 30 Rocks Jane Krakowski as a limb regenerator and especially stage actor supreme Michael Cerveris (Tommy Sweeney Todd) swathed in foam rubber as the fatso villain Mr. Tiny. Newcomer Chris Massoglia plays Darren the blind teen who gets involved with the freaks (its not that I cant tell you how I just dont want to). But Darren does get bitten by redheaded vampire Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly giving the film the few laughs it has). Actually Darren is only halfbitten. Hell Im not explaining that either. All you need to know is that the movie is a setup for sequels that I hope never come. Jammed with story threads that dont cohere Cirque commits the cardinal sin for a vampire movie Its bloodless.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Drama. Starring John C. Reilly Josh Hutcherson Ray Stevenson and Jessica Carlson. Directed by Paul Weitz. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If there really are any real vampires out there they need a good Hollywood marketing campaign or maybe a lobbyist. Vampires used to be portrayed by debonair actors who simply wanted to suck your blood. Now they run super-fast like the Flash some of them look like John C. Reilly and they all seem to have a social conscience. Its only a matter of time before they start driving a Prius and baking vegan muffins with Ed Begley Jr. ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" is a celebration of this wussified new breed of vampire. The movie is occasionally clever but still inferior to last years ""Twilight"" film mostly because the story is so muddled. Its clear that the filmmakers had a hard time adapting Darren Shans books made the movie way too long and then hacked indiscriminately at the last minute. Some important scenes are cut off abruptly and others seem to be missing altogether. The action begins in high school where Steve and Darren (Josh Hutcherson and Chris Massoglia) are best friends on opposite paths. After a visit to a freak show - the best part of the film by far and the only focused sequence - rebellious Steve and passive Darren get recruited by opposing vampire factions. Reilly is Larten Crepsley a melancholy vampire who mentors Darren teaching him how to feed without killing the victim. (Candy-ass New Age vampire that he is Darren responds by saying he doesnt want to drink blood at all.) ""Cirque du Freak"" doesnt even work as bait for the young teen demographic that cant seem to get enough of all things vampire. Steve is too mean to be dreamy and Darren has a sidekick vibe that takes the steam out of what little romance they give him in the script. Imagine if Anthony Edwards had the Maverick role in ""Top Gun."" Reilly makes his character interesting overcoming the visual distractions of his Phil Spector arraignment hair and wardrobe by Prince. The inhabitants of the freak show are also entertaining especially Salma Hayek as Madame Truska a fortune teller/bearded lady. Whenever the other vampires hit the screen the movie becomes boring. Like the recent ""Jennifers Body"" ""Cirque du Freak"" has a serious identity crisis trying to be too many things at once and failing at most of them. There isnt a single good scare and almost no menace. In the end all thats left is quirkiness and some OK special effects. One improvement over ""Twilight"" the running vampires here dont look like someone hit fast-forward on a VCR. -- Advisory This film contains strong language violence and disturbing images including Salma Hayek with a ""Teaser and the Firecat""-era Cat Stevens beard.

John C Reilly gamely chomps the scenery as showman Crepsley who invites Darren (Chris Massoglia) into an underworld of freaks and vampires. Theres a lot of backstory and the plot is often hazy. There are also so many characters that some barely register while others - like our teen hero - are just unlikeable. Its very energetic but a more relaxed sequel in which everyone has fun might be a big improvement.

A whole 5? i do agree that the actors do quite well for the parts they were given but i heared that debbie hemlock might be in the next movie. how the hell will that work? oh and the main thing. WHERE THE HELL IS STEVE GREST? i dont like using full capitals but i would rather watching someone line up all the books and then burn them one by one. that way it wouldnt be such an insult to the books. . one more thing. darren isnt supposed to be that old. hes meant to be a kid. because he isnt the scene with darren jumping on lartens back just looks wrong. i did force myself to watch the whole thing and i wish i hadnt. all they need to do now is forget about of Vancha March and theyve completely screwed everything up. another thing what the hell is up with Harkat? Harkat was made to not hurt Darren ad is supposed to be a few feet tall not a bitin foot long demon. i wish i had never known about the movieFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 19 2010RyanFeaturedAmazing film.

The great thing about the books was darren shans amazing story telling that keeps people interested and continualy thinking throughout the books the director basicly had a script written for him why mess with that and invent events and meetings that didnt need to happen such as when he meets mr tiny after the show who should be SMALL which annoyed me so much he is ment to be short as it is a double joke with his name as he is short and with desmond shortened to des his name spellls destiny an inside joke about how he controles the charectors and their actions without them realising he also would never have met the vampenese in the car with him as he is in a different town and years into the future there was no need to mix around the story line like this you would go kill obi one in the third star wars movie so why mess around with this one. I also dont like the casting and think whoever was in charge of it should be fired and never be given a job in film making ever again its not that the actors are bad i like most of the ones whom i had heard of before the film but none of them are really very suited to the parts which they play such as with john C reilly could never be ""creepy"" enough to play mr creapsly and the part would be much better suited to johnny depp. On the whole i believe that the movie would be almost unconcievably better if they had stayed more true to the story and had not gone crazily off course inventing charectors and removing others they also needed to give darrens normal life in much more detail the 2 minuites which said he was cool and clever was not enough to make him seem like a realistic charector in my opinion they should have done the first book as a movie on its own and then done movies as 2 or 3 books for the rest as with a good background which they could easily of used as a base on which to try and creat an amazing series of movies such as harry potter rather than the one movie like lemmony snickets a serries of unfortunate events became from trying to rush the serries along even with this seemingly giant review i could easily stay and complain about more things such as the location in america the relationship between darren and steve the unbelievable parents unlike the charectors that they are ment to be like ect. i do however have to admit that i did not watch the whole of the film and could only make myself watch the first 30 minutes because as a true lover of the books could not stand to see them butched any further. i would give this film a 5/100 as i believe that not only my time was wasted but my life has been damaged by it and i hope that say in 5 years it will get a drastic remake such as with the incredable hulk so that the story will be enjoyed by many more peopleFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2009Derrek SarkstonFeaturedThe Books were amazing in my opinion the best Saga ever the movie was also very good but i prefer the books in my opinion the books are always better then the movies and i would have loved if Mr.Crepsley was played by johnny dep or someone else because if you have read the books you would know that mr.crepslys personality and apperance is much far from this actors thats why i gave the movie 4 stars they should pick vetter actors in some of the characters.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2009SkillBillFeaturedJust read the rating FFS Everyone should see thisFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2009SkillBillFeaturedJust read the rating FFS Everyone should see thisFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 2 2009John WhittingdaleFeaturedExcelent.

Sometimes entertaining occasionally even funny and often simply appalling overall it scales the giddy heights of absolute mediocrity. Replete with two-dimensional cardboard cutout characters some of them pure caricatures it has little to offer an adolescent audience let alone an adult one. Children of primary school age might enjoy it more but its 12A rating is well-deserved and it is not for the sensitive child. The film has one moment of sheer awesome near the end (watch out for Mr. Tinys last trick) but for me that isnt enough to drag it out of the quagmire of drivel which precedes that point. The best thing that I can say about this movie is that it isnt Dance Flick and it wasnt directed by Damien Wayans. And whilst thats a good thing to say about any movie its a pretty low bar to cross. Frankly I was thinking of giving this film two stars but then I read all the frankly unbelievable 5-star supposed consumer reviews (below) and I realised that to give this piece of garbage two stars would be an insult to all the other movies Ive given two stars to recently. And ""vampanese""? Oh please. What an awful and totally unnecessary word. It makes my skin crawl and not in a good way. In summary this movie is very bad.

"Confusion reigns in Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesConfusion reigns in Cirque du Freak The Vampires AssistantThe notion of presenting John C. Reilly in the guise of a sinister vampire has some obvious limitations.John C. Reilly in a scene from Cirque Du Freak The Vampires Assistant.  (AP / UNIVERSAL PICTURES)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Oct. 23 2009Starring Chris Massoglia John C. Reilly and Josh Hutcherson. Directed by Paul Weitz. 108 minutes. At major theatres. PGThe notion of presenting John C. Reilly in the guise of a sinister vampire has some obvious limitations. Best known for his oafish roles in movies like Boogie Nights and Step Brothers the actor is hardly a menacing figure. Hiring him to be a leather-clad creature of the night is like putting Will Ferrell in a biopic about Stalin or letting Larry David have a go at Hannibal Lecter. Article Continued BelowThis piece of miscasting is symptomatic of the confusion that reigns supreme in Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant. A disappointing attempt to launch a movie franchise based on the popular young-adult novels by Darren Shan the film cant decide whether its an earnest fantasy flick or a quirky horror comedy or whether its meant for kids or adults - no wonder it appears to have two titles. It is in fact named after the first two books in Shans series. The script by Brian Helgeland and director Paul Weitz actually shuffles together elements from the first three while transplanting the characters from Britain to America.Chris Massoglia plays a teen named Darren Shan (the books are presented as the authors autobiography though Shans actually a pen name for Irish writer Darren OShaughnessy). Life in his bland small town gets more exciting when he and his troubled best pal Steve (Josh Hutcherson) catch wind of a performance by Cirque du Freak. An exhibition of human oddities thats been travelling the globe for five centuries its got plenty to capture the imagination of any young lad thanks to performers like Madame Truska the Bearded Lady (Salma Hayek) and Evra the Snake Boy (Patrick Fugit). While Darren is most impressed by an act with a talented spider Steve recognizes the spiders master from one of his many books about vampires. After the show Steve implores the strange Mr. Crepsley (Reilly) to turn him into a bloodsucker but is rejected on account of his ""bad blood."" Due to a foolhardy act and a tragic twist of fate it is Darren who becomes Crepsleys half-vampire assistant. Though hes still human enough to walk around in daylight Darrens vamp half means a huge gain in strength and longevity. As Crepsley tells him ""Its a lonely life but theres lots of it.""Before he can take on this new vocation Darren must fake his death and abandon his family an event that is justly presented as horrific in the novels but gets a weirdly light-hearted treatment here. Nor does Darren have that much trouble adjusting to life in the Cirque though his refusal to drink from humans jeopardizes his health. Hes also got a role to play in the brewing conflict between gentler vampires like Crepsley who feed on humans without killing them and the more rapacious old-school variety known as the Vampaneze. The vivid universe of Shans gently macabre books is rich with possibilities for any savvy filmmaker. Instead Weitz clutters it up with frantic poorly staged action sequences a confusing tangle of storylines and ungainly dialogue that either adopts a tone of J.K. Rowling-style portentousness or a salty brand of humour more appropriate to one of Reillys comedies with Ferrell. And while the scenes with Darren among the Cirque folk boast a playful spirit thats reminiscent of the early films of Tim Burton the rest do such a poor job of aping Harry Potter and Twilight that the movies many references to Darrens future adventures smack of misplaced confidence. Like the 2007 adaptation of another contemporary kid-lit fave - Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials series - by Paul Weitzs brother Chris Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant feels like a once-promising franchises first and last entry.

Reilly and Salma Hayek star in this hybrid tale of teenagers a poisonous spider and warring vampire factions. ABOUT THE MOVIECirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant   1/2 out of four Stars John C. Reilly Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson Salma Hayek Ken Watanabe|DirectorPaul WeitzDistributorUniversal PicturesRating PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action disturbing images thematic elements and some languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY John C. Reilly is a new breed of vampire in Cirque du Freak. Orange-haired and average-looking with a loud sartorial style hes hardly dashing or smolderingly sexy. In fact he can be downright buffoonish. But hes principled. His life-affirming code of ethics bolsters his biting wit. The crowd of misfits he hangs with is a rowdy outlandish and strangely droll bunch. Into this universe of freaks come a pair of teen geeks and the union of these two worlds is celebrated with gusto and dark humor by director Paul Weitz (American Dreamz). Weitz has taken several of the popular childrens books in the series by Darren Shan and unified them into one tale adding an edgier tone to this part horror film part comedy and part teen romance. And given how overexposed vampires have become Cirque du Freak wisely takes a mocking approach. The limits of friendship are tested and familial bonds are torn asunder when Darren (Chris Massoglia) foolishly steals a large multihued spider he spies at a traveling freak how. His actions kick off a series of events that result in Darren becoming a half-vampire and an assistant to the sardonic Lartan Crepsley (Reilly). Intrigued by the possibilities Darren and best pal Steve (Josh Hutcherson) sneak out to attend what is billed as Cirque du Freak. Things go awry from the minute they arrive. Darren inadvertently destroys a centuries-old truce between warring vampire factions. And he and Steve find themselves on opposing sides. Director Weitz often works with his brother Chris. But Chris was busy directing his own vampire movie the second installment in the Twilight series due out next month. Vampire fascination must be in their blood. Though this genre hybrid is uneven it offers quite a few laughs if not all-out scares. Quirky members of the freak show are not given enough screen time Salma Hayek is a kind bearded lady Patrick Fugit plays a green-skinned Snake Boy and Orlando Jones is Alexander Ribs. The cirque is run by the fair-minded and lanky Mr. Tall (Ken Watanabe). Reilly does a fine job switching with agility from deadpan to smirking to outrageous in a role that requires him to go from jocular to menacing. Cirque du Freak encompasses those dualities. Family ties are valued but broken. The world Darren chooses is dark but colorful. But perhaps best of all the movie doesnt take itself too seriously. Its creepy but tinged with sarcasm and infused with silly fun. Posted E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Reilly) escorts girlfriend Madame Truska (Salma Hayek) in ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant."" The movie centers on a teen living a boring suburban life until he winds up fulfilling his destiny in a place drawn from nightmares. Photo Credit Universal Studios/MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two boys discover their destinies in a weird underworld. BOTTOM LINE An entertaining anti-""Twilight"" for pre-teens whod rather see more fighting than smooching. CAST John C. Reilly Willem Dafoe Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson LENGTH 149 Now that ""Twilight"" has staked out the vampire myth for preteen girls ""Cirque Du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" aims to claim it for the boys. Both films are based on young-adult novels but one focuses on heavy petting while the other gears up for a coming war. The ""Cirque"" books whose early installments predated ""Twilight"" come from Darren OShaughnessy writing in the first person as Darren Shan (played in the film by Chris Massoglia). Unlike the misfit heroine of ""Twilight"" Darren is a popular kid with loving if slightly controlling parents; his best friend is Steve (Josh Hutcherson ""Bridge to Terabithia"") a rowdier boy from an unstable home. advertisement | advertise on newsday Thanks to a traveling freak show the boys discover their separate but intertwined fates. Its no spoiler to say that Darren winds up in a coffin but Steve emerges as the more interesting character. Despite his troubled background hes kindhearted and principled - at least at first. ""Cirque"" also stars John C. Reilly as a refreshingly unglamorous vampire named Larten Crepsley. As he teaches Darren the ways of the underworld Crepsley becomes a reluctant father figure and not always a very good one. In other words hes human. There are plenty of freaks including Evra the Snake Boy (Patrick Fugit) and a rather cute girl (Jessica Carlson) whose hidden oddity will come in handy. Willem Dafoe has an amusing bit part but its Michael Cerveris a Tony-winning stage veteran who steals the show as Mr. Tiny a corpulent villain in the Sydney Greenstreet mold. MoviesCirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant The script by Brian Helgeland (""A Knights Tale"") and director Paul Weitz frequently strays off course though the underlying story is always compelling. And just like ""Twilight"" this movie doesnt end so much as beg to be continued.

REILLY) in the frightening tale of a boy who is pulled into a fantastic life of misunderstood sideshow freaks and grotesque creatures of the night--""Cirque Du Freak"". Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The teen neck-biter sweepstakes gains a new entrant with ""The Vampires Assistant"" a distillation of several titles from the popular British ""Cirque du Freak"" series. It isnt really much beyond a wry tone and a few earned laughs. As usual the fantasy form is used for a sneak psychology lesson. Darren Shan (Minneapolis actor Chris Massoglia) lives a tidy little life in a tidy little town. In other words hes half dead already. His parents have his ""happy productive"" future all planned out. Delinquent pal Steve (Josh Hutcherson ""Bridge to Terabithia"") points out adventures off the straight and narrow path. When they attend a shady freak show Darren is awestruck These are his people. In short order hes traveling with the show. He apprentices with slick hammy bloodsucker Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) falls for a cutie with a prehensile tail and becomes a player in a war between rival factions of undead. The film shuffles together episodes from the first three volumes of the 12-book ""Cirque"" saga which may explain its rushed patchy feel. It unfurls like a series of skits. Director Paul Weitz (""In Good Company"") films the carnival kitsch in poshly lurid color and gives his performers permission to camp it up. Reilly is droll in a red velvet suit top hat and a crown of carrot-colored hair. Hes a small-time ham with a classic con mans grand manner. Crepsley is a good vampire who refuses to chomp jugular veins. ""That would kill you"" he archly explains to Darren. Instead he anesthetizes his human prey makes a neat incision in the shoulder and sips delicately. This keeps the host alive and avoids the whole torch-and-pitchfork brouhaha sparked by his throat-ripping cousins the murderous Vampanese. The bad vamps led by obese Mr. Tiny (Michael Cerveris) want ... well Im not sure what they want other than to fight Crepsley and Darren. There are dark hints about the conflict between the mystical clans but the film is more interested in fisticuffs and splintering furniture. Its loud and emphatic but not terribly frightening. CIRQUE DU FREAK THE VAMPIRES ASSISTANT  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense supernatural violence and action disturbing images thematic elements and some language. ""The Vampires Assistant"" brims with youth-specific motifs fractured friendships disenchantment agonizing over choices first love travel. They dont fit smoothly into a vampire story but you can see what was intended. Massoglia gives a warm likable performance as Darren; just 17 he suggests a young John Krasinski. Salma Hayek inhumanly voluptuous and whiskered like a desert prophet plays the Cirques bearded lady; Ken Watanabe is somehow 9 feet tall as the colossal owner and gaunt Willem Dafoe sports a gigolos mustache as an elder vampire. Weitz cant get the jumble into coherent form. Hes a good comedy director but this spook show suffers from the kind of pacing that demands a laugh track.

""Eragon."" The release schedule of the last few years is cluttered with kickoffs to series that never got past that first disappointing episode. Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant (PG-13) Universal (109 min.) Directed by Paul Weitz. With John C. Reilly Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains violence. ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" is the latest flawed attempt. Based on the first three installments in a sprawling 12-book series ""The Vampires Assistant"" follows the life (and unlife) of Darren (Chris Massoglia) a typically lonely and maladjusted teen hero. When a peculiar circus comes to town he and best friend Steven (Josh Hutcherson) go to take in the freak show. But they become fascinated with the vampire magician Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) and before long both boys will become bloodsuckers themselves. Bloodsuckers on opposite sides of an ancient vampire war. The series of books by Darren Shan is quite popular but exactly why its popular is absolutely lost on director and co-writer Paul Weitz. The movie has no sense of magic or fun; the characters never seem to have anything at stake. Its just a lot of computer graphics and gleefully hamming-it-up actors. Some interesting actors at least. If the ""Potter"" films have become a kind of steady check for Britains best stage stars at least ""The Vampires Assistant"" provides some nice bonuses for Americas theatrical veterans and indie regulars. Reilly Willem Dafoe and Michael Cerveris all pass through here to snarl and strut. But its all pitched a little bit too high and a little off-center. Reilly who always exudes lumpish regular-guy decency never remotely convinces as a wise and ancient vampire. (Its as if Karl Malden played Count Dracula.) Cerveris hams it up. Other performers (including Selma Hayek as a busty bearded lady) have little to do. The films two teen stars Massoglia and Hutcherson get more screen time. But who wants to watch them? Massoglia is dully if pleasantly forgettable and Hutcherson telegraphs every emotion. Whats supposed to come off as a desperate blood feud looks like a Nickelodeon sitcom ""Drake amp; Josh the Undead Years."" Sure Hayek is pretty to look at even with the Smith Bros. treatment. Dafoe pumps a lot of quirky energy into what amounts to two very brief scenes. And some of the monsters are fun -- including a scaly snakeboy who really wants to be a rock star. But what could have been a truly magical Ray Bradbury kind of world full of midnight circuses runaway boys and soul-stealing business deals instead plays like tame jokey horror. And what might have been the beginning of a new tween fantasy series only feels like one more first -- and final -- chapter. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + So many vampires are crawling around movies and TV at the moment that any new kid on the block is forced to segment by age gender genre and possibly political affiliation. If the ""Twilight series is aimed at adolescent girls whose hearts go arrhythmic at the thought of being ravaged by Edward Cullen ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant is what a teenage boy might crave in a bloodsucker movie. Which is basically Bill and Teds Night of the Living Undead.Theres a lot of talent behind this first-strike adaptation of the popular young-adult book series by Darren Shan but not unfortunately where it counts. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland gave us ""L.A. Confidential and director Paul Weitz gave us ""American Pie and ""About a Boy. The supporting cast runs wide and deep from Jane Krakowski (""30 Rock) as a limb-regenerating sideshow vixen to Willem Dafoe as a vampire dandy.None of which matters when your lead actor is a dud. As Darren the high school hero who becomes apprentice to a vampire and gets drawn into a centuries-old feud Chris Massoglia is almost wholly charisma-free a handsome hesitant two-by-four who makes you appreciate the rich thespian skills of Daniel Radcliffe. Casting an unknown is always a gamble. This time the house wins.The aggravating part is that Josh Hutcherson a young actor of actual talent is stuck in the second-banana role of Steve Darrens bad-boy best friend. The two sneak out to a mysterious freak show in which the star attraction is a vampire named Larten Crepsley played by character actor John C. Reilly in a rare and welcome lead role. After a few plot complications Darren is chosen as Crepsleys right-hand man and becomes a ""half-vampire which the movie more or less views as dropping out of school for a real job.Theres some nonsense about a war between two tribes of bloodsuckers - Crepsley belongs to the good guys who sedate and sip rather than butcher their prey - but the pleasures of ""Cirque du Freak are in the snappy dialogue and enthusiastic secondary performances. Dafoe has only two scenes but he makes them count as a prissy little vampire - the Franklin Pangborn of the undead. Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous) plays a slithery slacker snake-boy Salma Hayek gets to grow a computer-generated beard and newcomer Jessica Carlson makes a very fetching monkey-girl love interest.Reilly gives it his all and hes both very enjoyable and about as scary as a stubbed toe. Its not the actors fault hes a big old teddy bear and anyway that fits the PG-13 marketing plan of ""Cirque du Freak a movie that breaks the heros neck and puts him temporarily six feet under while remaining as safe as a trip to the mall. Will there be a sequel a ""Cirque du Freak Legend of the Viable Franchise? Only if the filmmakers can find a lead actor whos certifiably among the living.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cirque-du-freak-the-vampire-s-assistant ) Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant (United States 2009) October 21 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Is it too much to ask that a narrative film have a beginning a middle and an end? Apparently in the case of Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant a loose adaptation of Darren Shans Vampire Blood trilogy the answer is ""yes."" Developed with the intention of being the first installment of a franchise the movie doesnt pretend to be self-contained leaving frayed loose ends and resolving little. This alone makes The Vampires Assistant a profoundly unsatisfying experience - and that doesnt consider the derivative nature of the plot and a lackluster performance by the lead actor. It would greatly surprise me if there is ever a sequel to The Vampires Assistant. A recognition of this forces the movie to stand on its own which it cannot do. In an era when vampires are insanely popular Universals lack of confidence in the production speaks volumes. The original release date was pushed back and the studio is doing the bare minimum to promote it. This has all the earmarks of something that will play for about two weeks around Halloween before heading for home video where it will vanish into obscurity. Those curious about ""what happens next"" will have to read the books (there are twelve of them). Ironically director Paul Weitz appears to have been ensnared by the same issue that trapped his brother Chris whose cinematic version of The Golden Compass crashed and burned leaving Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials saga partially told. The Vampires Assistant represents yet another attempt to defang vampires. Apparently there are no longer any rules - writers can create the undead in whatever fashion they want discarding unwanted aspects of the mythos. Of all the recent cinematic bastardizations of the vampire only the Twilight version has been meeker. The vampires in this movie drink blood but without hurting their victims (they dont have fangs). They age but very slowly. Theyre involved in an intra-species war (thats currently being interrupted by an uneasy truce). ""Full"" vampires dont like sunlight but ""half"" vampires are okay with it. They can move really fast but cant fly or shape-change. Crosses and garlic dont bother them. And of course they are to be pitied rather than feared or hated. The films central character is Darren (Chris Massoglia) an arachnophile who steals a rare breed of spider from the vampire Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly). When the spider delivers a fatal bite to Darrens best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson) Darren must make a deal with the vampire to save Steves life in exchange for Larten administering the anti-venom to Steve Darren agrees to become a ""half-vampire"" and function as Lartens assistant. This forces him to ""die"" to his friends and family and continue his existence living with the performers of the ""Cirque du Freak."" But theres a war brewing between the vampires and their bloodthirsty cousins the Vampeneze and both Darren and Steve have parts to play. Much of the film unfolds like a superhero story with Darren undergoing a transformation spending time rejecting his new abilities then eventually learning about them and embracing them. In reality he has more in common with Spider-Man than with Dracula. As superhero narratives go however this one is sloppy and uninspired. The climactic confrontation is a sham; I guess we are expected to wait for future installments to see a real resolution. Meanwhile any hints of horror - a reasonable expectation considering that the main character is a vampire - are neutered to the point of irrelevancy. Then again its pretty hard to accomplish anything graphic and maintain a PG-13 rating. Although John C. Reilly and Willem Dafoe are amusing as vampires and Salma Hayek is strangely erotic as a bearded woman the two leads are miscast. As Darren Chris Massoglia is boring. His portrayal is not only unsympathetic its uninteresting. We are supposed to be invested in Darren but Massoglias portrayal encourages apathy. Josh Hutcherson isnt much better. He plays Steve like a bully on a TV sit-com and is almost a clone of the alienated teenager who is turned into a vampire in Fright Night. At least there are some interesting names in the supporting cast - Ray Stevenson as Murlaugh the Vampaneze Michael Cerveris as Mr. Tiny Jessica Carlson as Rebecca the monkey girl Patrick Fugit as Evra the snake boy and Ken Watanabe as Mr. Tall. Arguably the most intriguing aspect of The Vampires Assistant is its exploration of the society of freaks and how Darren is integrated as a member. He becomes friends with the snake boy and falls in love with the girl with the prehensile tail. Unfortunately the special effects are shoddy so the freaks more often look like obvious CGI creations than real carnival outcasts. If that was the only problem with The Vampires Assistant there wouldnt be much to complain about but this movie is undone by a legion of flaws the most glaring of which is its inability to build to a conclusion. It stops in the middle expecting viewers to wait for the next installment which will probably never arrive. That makes it not only a waste of time but a tease.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 22 2009 243 PM Title Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Teen friends become vampire enemies. With John C. Reilly Salma Hayek. Director Paul Weitz (148). PG-13 Violence disturbing images and themes language. At area theaters.If Chris Weitz instantly became the popular kid when he was asked to direct the second ""Twilight"" movie his brother Paul remains the outsider with this lesser assignment. But in the world of vampires the most natural place is often on the outside. While ""Twilight"" will make more money and get more attention the darkly comic ""Cirque du Freak"" boasts the shaggy charm of the natural underdog.Based on Darren Shans young-adult series ""Cirque"" centers around two best friends troubled Steve (Josh Hutcherson) and sensitive Darren (Chris Massoglia). When they stumble upon a freak show Steve is fascinated and Darren is repelled. But the latter is the one who winds up making a deal with the Devil -- or more accurately with a vampire named Crepsley (John C. Reilly). To save Steves life Darren agrees to become Crepsleys assistant and a vampire himself. As a result hes forced to reject his own friends and family to live with Crepsleys circus of freaks. These include a psychic (Salma Hayek) a snake man (Patrick Fugit) and a monkey girl (Jessica Carlson). Darrens disappearance infuriates Steve who is recruited by a clan of far more vicious vamps. With the two friends pitted against each other a potentially apocalyptic war is set in motion.Or at least I hope it is. Despite a few battles the war itself is left for a sequel that may or may not get made. Weitz seems overwhelmed by the amount of material hes forced to pack into a single film and he deserves a chance to expand upon this world. All the freaks who embrace their differences even as others reject them hold potential. And we definitely need more of Reilly who seems energized by the opportunity to play such a confident complex character. Scruffy and a little tentative ""Cirque"" cant top ""Twilights"" gorgeous leads and glam romance. But not every teen can relate to beautiful Bella or broody Edward.

Based on the first three volumes of Darren Shans 12-book series the movie was intended to be a franchise launcher - a cross between Harry Potter and Twilight with a bit of comic-book pow and a smattering of gore thrown in to lure older teens. You can imagine how the Universal Pictures marketing department must have salivated over that pitch. How can it possibly miss right? But the finished film has been tinkered with and tweaked so thoroughly that it borders on the incomprehensible. The little that is good about The Vampires Assistant directed by the usually reliable Paul Weitz (In Good Company About a Boy) gets lost in an overly crowded cast of supporting characters better suited to a TV series some surprisingly cheesy CGI work and an uneven tone that feels like the result of constant studio tampering. Most disappointing is the script written by Weitz and Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential Mystic River) which sacrifices clarity and narrative momentum in order to set up the next chapter. With so much backstory to fill in and so many players to squeeze in the films protagonist the gentle good-natured Darren (Chris Massoglia) is never fully defined. Hes just a sweet ordinary kid who in order to save the life of his best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson) agrees to become a ""half-vampire servant for the pacifist bloodsucker Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) and join his traveling circus of freaks. That decision costs Darren his parents and sister who presume he committed suicide but brings him a new family - a green-skinned snake boy (Almost Famous Patrick Fugit) a bearded psychic (Salma Hayek) a deformed giant (Ken Watanabe) and an assortment of other creatures and monsters most of whom welcome Darren warmly into their fold. There is also Willem Dafoe as a fellow freak/vampire whose primary talent appears to be spouting reams of exposition wherever he goes. The premise is rich with potential but The Vampires Assistant sacrifices its characters for the sake of dull exposition including much business about a war between regular vampires who have learned to drink blood from humans without killing them and the more violent ""vampaneze"" who relish sucking their prey dry. Theres so much stuff to keep track of that the films editing is unusually choppy and the actors all seem distracted. The normally-resourceful Reilly does surprisingly little with his paternal vampire while Massoglia excels only at depicting Darrens blandness. The film practically ignores the darker undertones of Darrens decision to give up his normal life - lets not forget about that tween demographic - which would have given this weightless picture some heft. All that distracting vampire-war business might have been better served in a separate film - theres a good reason why it took the books author three volumes to tell the same tale - but The Vampires Assistant has been built as a quasi-cliffhanger first a stand-alone movie second. The crassness ends up sabotaging the entire enterprise. Like The Golden Compass another failed start of a supposed series directed by Weitzs brother Chris The Vampires Assistant leaves you hanging for a sequel that will never arrive. The only way to find out what happens next of course will be to read the books. The movie may be a dud but Darren Shan is a genius.

I think those two brothers need to stop making a destroying potentially good films. Also the movie is based on the first three books so how can they ignore the fact that Darren doesnt want to give up his humanity To add to that Larten Creplsey has a dark personality so why cast Reiley for a part like. By the way who the heck is Willem Dafoe that isnt a character in the books there is not one part of any of the books that mention another vampire at the cirque(bedsides Gavner Purl in the third book informing a vampaneze is in his home city and of coarse Vancha March whom doesnt even show up untill the 7th book) that is trying to expose Darren This movie is just going to disgrace the books im sorry Darren Posted by ryan | October 22 2009 at 1038 AM Oh to add to my dissapointment Evra seems to be slimy (SNAKES ARE NOT SLIMYDUH) and i dont think Evra is green or a early 90s punk ALSO HOW DARE YOU SCREW UP DEDDIES CHARACTERHer character is very important she is in a great deal of the last 5 books as well as the 3rd book They went to the extent of calling her Rebecca and making her a monkey girl ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT IS SO FAR OFF IT ISNT EVEN FUNNY I honestly could deal with calling her Rebecca but MAKING HERA MONKEY GIRL. There is not one fight between vampires in the first trilogy besides Darren and Larten and that was because Darren was reluctant to drink blood and Larten tried to force it upon him. I have to wander if they even will add Sam Grest into the movie along with his death by the wolf man If they didnt add RV (Reggie Veggie) into the picturem then there would be no point to the first movie at all. Posted by ryan | October 22 2009 at 1050 AM Fucks sake. Your all so fucking picky. Chris Josh John theyre all brilliant actors. You cannot slag off the director because in my opinion this film was one of the best Ive seen in a while. Who honestly gives two shits about Twilight? EVERYTHING these days are compared to it and its driving me INSANE. Twilight was good let it go. People only like it because they think RPattz will either bed or bite them. Get over yourselves he doesnt even like the fame. Posted by Katie | November 17 2009 at 1253 PM look tbh i think the director have a good imagination because at least you get a different story to the book so when you read the book you never know what to expect in the film and you are all very very very picky and tbh i think its a great film and i agree with katie i think the movie is great and that everything is compared to twilight but wouldnt you get bored of film that are the same over and over againand the evra isnt slimly he is shredding btw Posted by alexandra lawton | February 22 2010 at 0142 PM Haha not bad not bad... I think it has a nice twist to it. Posted by vampire art | September 26 2010 at 0141 AM in my personal opinion the movie is a joke. I love cirque du freak but I hate the movie with a passion. They should have followed the books instead of doing what they pleased as it seems. So to me the movie destroyed the series.

Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Bad Director Paul Weitz. Cast John C. Reilly Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson Salma Hayek Michael Cerveris. Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action disturbing images thematic elements and some language. Related Cirque du Freaks young star is gasp a normal teen Hollywood gushes bloodsuckers in vampire boom Brothers Paul and Chris Weitz talk about vampire movies Vampire movies Spotlight John C. Reilly You have your traditional vampires (""Nosferatu"") your blond slayer foils (""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") your sexy vamps (""True Blood"") your Euro children vampires (""Let the Right One In"") and your melancholy teenage variety (""Twilight""). The undead are not only alive theyre also multiplying and creating new vampire species and subspecies faster than fruit flies. Each has its own version of the mythology Fangs are optional bloodthirstiness varies. The latest entry to this overcrowded field is ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" which arrives with quixotic dreams of a franchise of its own. The source material this time is a series of young adult books known as ""Cirque du Freak"" or ""The Saga of Darren Shan"" written by Darren OShaughnessy - who writes under his protagonists name Darren Shan. We meet the world of ""Cirque du Freak"" through Darren (Chris Massoglia) a popular straight-A high-schooler whom his rebellious best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson) calls ""Mr. Perfect."" His parents lecture him on the path to a ""happy productive"" life with the depressingly rigid mantra ""College. Job. Family."" Though Darren is wide-eyed and naive he harbors a love of spiders. Steve idolizes vampires. Darren shrugs that these obsessions are ""in our blood"" - and director Paul Weitz sees fit to prove it to us with a sudden zoom into Darrens capillaries where little spiders dance around double helixes. Both get a front-row seat to their dark secrets when a traveling freak show comes to town. Theyre lured in by a mysterious flyer tossed from a spooky black car (license plate ""DES-TINY""). At the show - with the help of some digital effects - is a bearded lady (Salma Hayek) the very tall Mr. Tall (Ken Watanabe) a superthin man (Orlando Jones) a snake boy (Patrick Fugit) and others. The main attraction though is Crepsley (John C. Reilly) whom Steve recognizes as a vampire. Darren and Steve quickly and carelessly involve themselves with the group and without much ado Darren becomes a half-vampire (kind of like dual citizenship) and Steve the real deal. Darren is taken in by Crepsley and lives among the freaks of the touring circus. Steve casts his lot not with Crepsley but Muraugh (Ray Stevenson) a vampaneze. If that sounds like a cross between a vampire and a chimpanzee well you just summed up this film. It turns out that theres a centuries-long feud between vampires (who merely sedate their prey and take a taste of blood) and vampaneze (who still take the vulgar old-fashioned approach to killing people). These vampires are characterized by their ability to ""flit"" - that is run blurringly fast. They also have long and hard fingernails. They do keep the one vampire standby though trench coats. Reilly (a fine actor out of place here) takes being a vampire seriously but his best bits are his amusing scoffing at conventional vampire traits. He pronounces ""Vampires dont need cell phones"" Such jokes are the highlights of the film and suggest what it could have been an out-and-out comedy. Weitz should have known that too having helmed the solid 2004 comedy ""In Good Company"" 2002s ""About a Boy"" and 1999s ""American Pie."" Instead ""Cirque du Freak"" might be the single most overstuffed movie of the year. You have a high school film crossed with a vampire film crossed with a mutant film crossed with Willem Dafoe cameos. ""Cirque du Freak"" races so fast (sorry ""flits"") that no one has any motive except the oft-repeated ""Matrix""-esque explanation that ""it is written."" The supernatural (which even includes a cannibalistic Jane Krakowski in what feels like a ""30 Rock"" sketch) and its accompanying history of half-vampires and vampaneze never establishes itself as anything but ridiculous.

The carnage from that smooshing litters this hectic yet dull tale about a high school kid named Darren (Holes Chris Massoglia all too generic) who -- long story -- becomes a half vampire and hangs out with a traveling freak show much to the anger of his best friend (Josh Hutcherson). Darrens mentor is a rather droll full vampire dubbed Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly working heroically to keep the movie aloft with his laid-back charm). Crepsleys nemesis is the angry bloodsucker Murlaugh (Ray Stevenson). Dont bother to take notes because subplots go nowhere and characters -- many played ? by well-known actors -- barely get screen time. Willem Dafoe Salma Hayek and Jane Krakowski are among those who are there and gone. (Hayek is an entertaining eyeful as a lady with both full boobs and full beard.) Cross my heart with a stake through it this Cirque du Freak newbie could barely distinguish between the vampires (the ""good"" guys who have learned how to coexist with humans) and their hungrier less tolerant rivals the Vampaneze. But Freak cognoscenti sitting near me were equally underwhelmed even as a violent showdown had the whole bloody cast flying around and whomping one another.

"Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Movie review of Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant -- 3 out of 5 stars John C. Reilly and Chris Massoglia Universal Universal Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant is sort of a Twilight-lite. Its about vampires and its about teenagers. But where Twilight vamps down Romance Novel Road Freak based on Darren Shans novels is a lark and in this case the laughs are intentional.The movies big drawback is that it isnt silly enough. Chris Massoglia is Darren a good kid with good parents but a boy under the influence of the classmate his parents call ""that damned Steve"" (Josh Hutcherson). Steves a class-cutting vandalizing punk who leads Darren away from ""the path to a happy productive life"" or so the parents warn.Darren should have listened because when a strange Euro-limo passes through town dropping flyers for ""The worlds greatest freak show"" Steve insists they go. And mixed up with the bearded lady ( Salma Hayek) and Alexander Ribs (Orlando Jones) theres a real live vampire. Steve recognizes Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) from his vampire books and is anxious to escape his miserable life by joining the undead. But the guy whose ""destiny"" it is to join the vampires in their war with the murderous Vampanese is Darren. Director Paul Weitz (In Good Company) and writer Brian Helgeland (Mystic River) go for something like a Buffy the Vampire Slayer goof on teens dealing with issues of eternal life/eternal damnation. The dialogue lacks the wit of the visuals -- chasing a vampires trained spider through school is a highlight. Reilly is well cast as a playful seen-it-all blood-sucker who explains what awaits Darren if the kid chooses to earn his fangs -- ""Its a lonely life but theres lots of it.""A plumped-up Michael Cerveris from TVs Fringe makes a dandy fey villain the one playing vampires against one another. The kids arent bad with freak show member Rebecca (Jessica Carlson) providing the coy teen love interest.But despite some amusing scenes and ""rules"" for this vampire world the script never sinks its teeth into the Cirque freaks and never once works up a decent fright. This Assistant could use more on-the-job training.  Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant Three of five starsCast John C. Reilly Chris Massoglia Josh Hutcherson Salma Hayek Michael CerverisDirector Paul WeitzRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesIndustry rating PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action disturbing images thematic elements and some language. .

Drawn from the young-adult books by U.K. author Darren Shan Cirque du Freak has F/X creatures teen angst and romance mysterious backstories and a brewing war between beasties. On paper its a perfect formula--Twilight meets X-Men meets Harry Potter--but the on-screen result is not the sum of its parts. Cirque du Freak opens in sunny suburbia where bland high-schooler Darren (Chris Massoglia) hangs out with his neer-do-well buddy Steve (Josh Hutcherson). Something wacky this way comes The titular freak show is in town for one night only. The two sneak out to meet the freaks including sardonic spider-tamer Larten (John C. Reilly) whom Steve recognizes from one of his occult books as a 220-year-old vampire. Soon enough Darren becomes a half-vampire (?) whose new love interest--a cute girl too insecure to show her monkey tail--teaches him that ""being human is not about what you are but who you are""; Darren battles the now-evil Steve who is also now-jealous because Darren got to become a vampire; and Willem Dafoe shows up looking like Vincent Price resurrected. Some of you are thinking That sounds rad And Cirque might have worked if were either straight dark comedy or actually dark like its source material. Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie) the movie suffers from the same tonal schizophrenia of that other recent goth wannabe Jennifers Body Is it meant to be scary or funny? Oops its neither.

Anyone looking to kick off a teen fantasy franchise can draw several valuable lessons from the failure of Universals ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"" the first (and likely the last) cinematic adaptation of the popular Brit neck-biter series. First if youre counting on a propertys built-in fan base dont stray too far from the source. Second make sure the opening entry stands alone; theres no point wasting energy to set up sequels thatll never happen. Finally like brother Chris (""The Golden Compass"") director Paul Weitz seems better suited to comedy than to big-budget make-believe. Attempting to do for the vampire set what J.K. Rowling did for wizards Darren Shans 12-book ""Cirque du Freak"" series tells the story of a young outsider inducted into a traveling freak show where he becomes a half-vampire and learns to fit in among a motley bunch of semi-supernatural types. The film adapted by helmer Paul Weitz and Brian Helgeland focuses on just the first three volumes unwisely treating the plot like an extended preview for more exciting adventures to follow. Evidently theres a massive war brewing between the vampires (well-behaved bloodsuckers whove found a way to coexist with humans) and the more violent ""Vampaneze."" Inter-species political strife is just about the last thing a young adult fantasy movie needs and yet ""The Vampires Assistant"" treats such conflict with total seriousness suggesting its two generic juvie leads are somehow destined to play pivotal roles in a cosmic power struggle. The production puts far too much faith in the appeal of newcomer Chris Massoglia who plays Darren Shan a rule-abiding good-grade-earning conformist with the shaggy coif and bland gumdrop charm of your average Nickelodeon character. Potentially more interesting is his bad-influence best friend Steve (talented teen star Josh Hutcherson). Steve is obsessed with vampires and flips out when Cirque du Freak comes to town for a one-night-only performance dragging Chris along for a night of twisted-cool spectacle. During the show Steve recognizes fiery-haired emcee Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) from one of his many books on the undead ducking backstage afterward to see if the larger-than-life entertainer will turn him into a vampire too. Thats pretty much the last remotely plausible decision by any character in the film Why does Darren fake his death and become a vampire if thats Steves dream? Why does Steve stick a videogame system in Darrens coffin if he thinks his friend is really dead? And what could possibly motivate the pair to get mixed up on opposite sides of the great Vampaneze conflict? ""The Vampires Assistant"" shows all the signs of being reworked into oblivion with dead-end narrative threads and characters who disappear from its sprawling unwieldy ensemble (including Salma Hayek Patrick Fugit Willem Dafoe and half a dozen others). Weitz has clearly taken on more than he can handle here and the nuanced attention to character evident in ""About a Boy"" and ""In Good Company"" is the first thing to suffer. The storys rich milieu echoes that of Disneys dark ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" though its hard to imagine todays kids harboring fantasies of running away with the circus and Weitz never convincingly sells the characters stir-crazy small-town anxiety anyway. Theres a vague sense of how foreign and exciting it might be to become a vampire with salty language and revisionist vampire humor thrown in to make the film feel subversive but Darrens coming of age among the undead carries the same lame lessons as teenybopper TV ""Its not about what you are; its about who you are."" Pic is well shot but poorly edited with the interesting bits of detail (namely anything to do with the Cirque du Freak) compressed into uneven montages. Shans source material follows the same archetype used throughout young-adult adventure movies whether its Luke Skywalker going off to be a Jedi or Spider-Man eager to explore his new superpowers but ""The Vampires Assistant"" is too busy making impossible claims about just how spectacular its sequels will be to serve up a self-contained story with a satisfying finale.
