A feather-light metaphor for our times--thats really the only way a movie like this can make any sense. Columbia Pictures and Rovio Animation Ltd.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Megan Garber May 20 2016 Culture ""Cash grab"" is so elegant as an epithet. Not only does it highlight one of the fundamental tensions of an industrialized Hollywood--movies made for Money versus movies made for Art--but it also accomplishes that neatest of rhetorical tricks It treats commercial success as an implicit artistic rebuke. Ugh that movie exists just to make money. Ugh another sequel/reboot/franchise/brand extension. Ugh another movie with ""properties"" instead of ""characters.""Related Story Captain America Civil War Is Marvel at Its Best Its also possible of course that a movie might prove popular and thus lucrative precisely because it has artistic merit just as its possible that the factors at play in a Hollywood cash grab--an increasingly globally minded studio system making movies that are as broadly human and relevant as possible--might actually be a good and democratizing thing.In that sense theres something wonderfully pure about The Angry Birds Movie which is a cash grab of the most nakedly cashgrabby strain Here is a movie that is itself a brand extension and one thats been extended from a brand that got popular entirely on the basis of its own whimsical nihilism. Here is a movie with such pretensions toward global universality that it does away with humans entirely. Here are the basic stakes of the cash grab--cinema-for-the-spreadsheet and cinema-for-the-soul--colliding in the form of a movie that came from a game that is best known not for entertaining people so much as distracting them. Can the result of that be any good at all? Can capitalism so unfettered produce anything of artistic value?In this case Sure The Angry Birds Movie is really not bad. It is actually very actively okay. The film has taken its bird-brained brand--nouns and verbs and an adjective unsullied by sentences--and used it to construct characters and plots that are certainly serviceable and possibly even inspired. It takes its core components (pigs explosions slingshots rage) and combines them in a way that checks all the boxes you would expect a film like this an ambitiously chirpy product of the tentacular Hollywood studio system of 2016 to check It layers kid-friendly gags with subtler for-adult jokes; it offers along the way several unobjectionable lessons about life and those who live it; it has really good animation. It also features the vocal talents of some of the best comedians out there among them Jason Sudeikis (Red the angry protagonist) Josh Gad Bill Hader Maya Rudolph Peter Dinklage Kate McKinnon Keegan-Michael Key Tituss Burgess Ike Barinholtz Hannibal Buress and Tony Hale.The Angry Birds Movie is really not bad. It is actually very actively okay.The plot goes basically like this Red a resident of the vaguely tropical and stridently happy-go-lucky Bird Island is antisocial to the point of misanthropy (misornithropy?). And the feeling among his fellow feathered islanders is mutual. After an unfortunate incident involving a bungled cake delivery for a youngsters ""hatch day"" Red is brought to court by the chicks parents--and then sentenced to yep anger management. As Red reluctantly undergoes a program that involves yoga and poetry-writing and Talking About Feelings a ship arrives on the island. Out of its hulking body steps a green pig Leonard who brings with him delicious food (wine candy and--natch--pigs in blankets) and distracting entertainments (pigs in this universe are extremely fond of line-dancing disco trampolines and Blake Shelton).Red is the only one who doubts the pigs intentions. He tries to warn his fellow birds that the pigs visit to Bird Island--the ""New World"" the pigs call it--might pose a danger. The birds ignore him. They simply keep eating and dancing and engaging in scenes that allow the films screenwriter--Jon Vitti who is best known for his work on The Simpsons but is also responsible for Alvin and the Chipmunks--to make many many pig-and-bird puns. (There are strewn about the movies environs HAM radios and a billboard advertising Calvin Swine and references to The Eagles and to Kevin Bacons appearance in Hamlet and to Jon Hamm. There are utterances of ""Pluck my life"" and to parents with a large brood of chicks ""You guys ever thought about bird control?"" Etc.)It might lack the creative vision of Inside Out and the artistic confidence of the stridently gonzo Lego Movie; still The Angry Birds Movie is surprisingly effective as a stand-alone feature. Movies in the game-to-screen vein whether Tron or Doom or Battleship (or soon enough Tetris) can go pretty much one of two ways They can either embrace their own constraints using their initial narrative vacuity as an opportunity for absurdist allegory in the manner of The Lego Movie... or they can drown in them via characters that make no sense and plots that make even less (oof Battleship).The Angry Birds Movie to its credit is decidedly in the former camp. It functions ultimately in its human-less broadly reaching storyline as a parable (or more precisely several of them) It has things to say about colonialism (no seriously) and about the seductions of consumer culture and about the compromises that must be made in a civil society between the individual interest and the common good. Its a meditation on family values and on soft power versus hard and possibly even--via a leader who ends up being all bluster--on the political rise of Donald J. Trump.The film functions effectively as a fairy tale It uses its status as fantasy to impart lessons about reality.It also features an extended scene that involves an aging bird peeing loudly into the sparkling waters of the Lake of Wisdom. And it caps that scene off with a bird who has witnessed the scene uttering the line ""More like the Lake of Wiz"" So this is to be clear not the stuff of overt philosophy (or even in the films parlance the stuff of Ludwing Wittgenswine or Francis Bacon).But the fact that The Angry Birds Movie took its silly brand and extended it in its own way puts it in league with other recent films--not just The Lego Movie with all its messages about the dangers of consumerism and conformity and Inside Out with its propositions about the workings of human emotions but also Zootopia (which functions as among other things a parable about racial profiling and its consequences)--that similarly use their within-the-context-of-no-context premises as an excuse for allegory. These films arent set in the world of 2016. And yet of course they have a lot to say about that world. They take the supple symbolism of the comic book--the genre whose films and franchises are so often dismissed as ""cash grabs""--to its logical conclusion They are able to criticize a culture precisely because they locate themselves outside of it.Which is another way of saying that these movies function effectively as fairy tales. They use their status as fantasy to impart lessons about reality. And They treat their massive global audiences--the humans that have been grabbed along with the cash--not as a cause for shame but as an opportunity for conversation.Angry Birds the game since its launch in 2009 has received more than 3 billion downloads. (To put it in context there are approximately 7.4 billion people in the world.) Humans around the world have spent billions of hours cumulatively playing it. The game is at once a harmless delight and a massive time-suck and a stern rebuke to the idea espoused by the Internet theorist Clay Shirky and others that the creative affordances of the digital world might replace televisions mindless distractions with more productive pursuits.If Angry Birds the game rejects that theory one exploded pig at a time The Angry Birds Movie complicates it once more. It suggests that even the dumbest distractions can have some literary merit--and in that some lessons to impart. The film is not a masterpiece; still in its affable cinematic serviceability its evidence of one of the happier consequences of Hollywoods mercenary impulses the rise of movies that due to the demands of scale shed their cultural contexts in favor of more monomythic aspirations. We live too many of us in an age defined by anger about racial injustice about economic inequality about a world that is changing more quickly than we are able to keep up with. The Angry Birds Movie manages to be on top of everything else a meditation on all that anger--one that yes also features one bird telling another to ""shut your wormhole.""It might not be the kind of fairy tale we want but its the one we get. And the one we might keep getting for a while The closing credits of The Angry Birds Movie which feature birds dancing and pigs pigging and Demi Lovato singing an innocuous rendition of ""I Will Survive"" hint that a sequel is already in the works.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Angry Birds Movie The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; angry-birds-movie-the ) Angry Birds Movie The (Finland/United States 2016) May 21 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling The Angry Birds Movie an ""animated film"" is giving it airs. Its a cartoon. Deal with it. Family-friendly motion pictures whether live action or computer-drawn (the hand-drawn versions are no longer being made) fall into one of several categories. There are the top-of-the-line premium productions that seek to compete for awards and engage viewers of all ages. There are the less ambitious (but still expensive) middle-of-the-road endeavors that cater primarily toward children while throwing older viewers a bone or two. Then there are the dreaded only-for-kids movies that become endurance contests for parents. The Angry Birds Movie fits into the middle category. For post-puberty audiences its not painful but neither is it anything to get excited about. Its fitfully entertaining but the degree of enjoyment is inversely proportional to the viewers age. The movie shares a closer kinship with old-time Saturday morning TV fare than it does with a Pixar or Dreamworks big screen project. Angry Birds games have been around since 2009 when they burst upon the scene to become one of the post popular mobile downloads. From a single app to a stable of brand-enhancing opportunities Rovio has done everything possible to exploit and expand their empire. Some have called The Angry Birds Movie a ""90 minute commercial"" but that ignores the fact that people will see this movie because they have played the game not the other way around. This is just the next logical extension for a franchise that wants to infiltrate pop culture on every level and remain relevant for as long as theres money to be made. The Angry Birds Movie is like the game - an opportunistic attempt to ""strike while the iron is hot"" thats devoid of elements that would give it an extended life. The movie is surprisingly faithful to the game and thats one of its failings. While an app in which the user tosses birds at shabbily built structures can make for compelling play its somewhat limiting when it comes to crafting a narrative. The filmmakers do the best they can compiling a rudimentary backstory throwing in some music and action sequences and giving the birds fleshed out personalities but theres not enough here for a full length feature film - something that becomes obvious the longer the movie is on the screen. The story isnt going to challenge anyones ability to follow along even if they walk out for an extended bathroom/snack break or take a nap. After introducing us to the films three protagonists - Red (voice of Jason Sudeikis) Chuck (Josh Gad) and Bomb (Danny McBride) - were given a brief tour of Bird Island. When a pirate ship manned by green pigs and captained by the seemingly affable Leonard (Bill Hader) arrives there are parties and talk of mutual trust and peaceful co-existence...until the pigs steal all the birds children (eggs) and rush back home to make a big omelet. The now-angry birds follow intent not only on retrieving their as-yet unborn offspring but knocking down every building on Pig Island. The lead trio who are more fully rendered in the movie than in the game retain their essential characteristics while having various personality traits amplified by the screenplay and as a result of their voice actors all of whom are recognized real-life comedic figures. Red is sarcastic prone to tantrums and suspicious. Chuck is like a chicken on speed who does everything fast including talking. And Bomb is slow to anger but remains true to his name when circumstances demand it. Other Angry Birds mainstays make appearances - Matilda (Maya Rudolph) and Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) in particular. Theres also a really big mean bird (who looks more like the mobile game Red than the movie Red) who has the distinction of being voiced by Sean Penn. Aside from Leonard the pigs lack distinction and individuality. To give The Angry Birds Movie its due it looks nice in a generic computer-generated way. Considering that the co-directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly have backgrounds in animation (Kaytis having worked on a number of major Disney productions starting with Pocahontas and extending through Frozen). The movie takes the landmarks and characters of the video game and expands them nicely for the big screen. (Note I saw The Angry Birds Movie in 2-D so I cant comment on what 3-D adds or doesnt add to the experience.) The color palette is somewhat garish but thats in keeping with the productions overall aesthetic which features some exceedingly bad overproduced song-and-dance numbers that should have been left on the cutting room floor. I doubt anyone venturing out to a theater to see The Angry Birds movie will have unreasonable expectations. Its the first major motion picture based on a mobile app and anticipating anything more than an ephemeral diversion would be unrealistic. Its solid entertainment for kids but not nearly as successful for adults (a few double entendres being the extent of the ""mature"" content). With Zootopia fading in the rearview mirror and Finding Dori still a few weeks away it fills a niche. Asking more of this movie would be unfair - even if the cost of watching it is considerably higher than the cost of playing it.

What seems less obvious is a feature-length film that devotes 97 minutes to explaining the bird vs. pig premise of a game that was almost devoid of mythology to begin with. That contradiction is ""The Angry Birds Movie"" in microcosm an exercise in increasing storytelling confusion more befitting of an amorphous piece of Internet-age corporate branding than a thoughtful animated film. READ MORE Watch Its Time To Rage In New Trailer For The Angry Birds Movie Angry birds fighting greedy pigs is an effective summation of this films plot as theres not much sensical storytelling cushioning to be found here. Living their existence on a secluded island populated entirely by birds social misfits Red (Jason Sudeikis) Chuck (Josh Gad) and Boom (Danny McBride) all meet at a court-mandated anger management class. (Rage seems to be the last thing that connect this core trio given that their main crimes seem to be apathy hyperactivity and biological predisposition to spontaneous combustion respectively.) After some half-hearted attempts at bird-based world-building an odd group of neon-green pigs led by Leonard (Bill Hader) come to disturb the islands status quo. Initially there under a guise of friendship (Blake Shelton ditty and all) the pigs soon abscond with all the islands eggs. In order to restore order to the island and lay the groundwork for the sequel the three birds must rally various forces to rescue their unhatched infants. Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) makes an appearance as a misanthropic recluse but like the character in the original game his sole purpose seems to be as a character to unlock in order to complete the story. By the time birds are finally whirring their way through the air at the remote pig town there comes the crushing realization that tired unnecessary origin stories with pointless amounts of destruction and endangerment of innocents arent the exclusive realm of comic book movies. Perhaps just as disappointing as the haphazard storytelling is the squandering of a top-flight voice ensemble. Despite boasting a cast list with some of the most dynamic comic talents in the business (Tony Hale Jillian Bell Billy Eichner Hannibal Burress Tituss Burgess Kate McKinnon are just the start) these performers largely pop up in name only relegated to the deep background where they barely make a dent in the overall picture. As the town judge Keegan-Michael Key does an admirable job of creating a character with little screen time and a smaller amount of material but hes one of the only ones given that opportunity. Instead most of the attention that would have been devoted elsewhere is centered on Red a character who despite Sudeikis charms in other projects comes across as petty and disinterested even in his eventual moments of heroism. McBride steps outside the foul-mouthed know-it-all niche hes lived in so well and brings surprising pathos to a lovable loser. Gads first moments as Chuck are a well-needed burst of energy in an already-sagging narrative but those manic tendencies become so unfocused that every time the story has the actor start singing it seems like a desperate bid to grab a tiny childs flagging attention. The only people that seem to be having any fun here are the animators the closest thing ""The Angry Birds Movie"" comes to a saving grace. The rival textures of these warring species keep the overall look of the film from falling flat. The character design of the birds from their various spherical sizes to their expressive eyes to their different feather textures do more to differentiate and characterize them than any other element of the film. There are even a handful of sequences that break from the usual CGI mold and experiment with 2-D and time-lapse stylings. But these fleeting moments of visual dexterity are carelessly wedged into the rest of the story with the same haphazard effort given to its humor. Its not enough that the endless parade of cultural references feel dated and devoid of actual punchlines. Most of them seem unsure of what theyre actually saying. One of the pigs is named Jon Hamm. Artwork in the Mighty Eagles lair has the design of Shepard Faireys Andre the Giant sticker only with the reclusive birds face and the caption ""OHEY."" Theres a book in the King Pigs castle labeled ""Fifty Shades of Green."" Observations like ""That Guy Who Played Don Draper is a person"" ""Street Art Is Crazy Right?"" and the acknowledgment of the existence of the color spectrum do not constitute jokes. This is a mistake ""The Angry Birds Movie"" makes and makes repeatedly. (Its hard to blame this film for doubling-down on this lack of distinction since this is a formula thats made ""The Big Bang Theory"" an inexplicable ratings hit for the better part of this decade.) Even for an animated comedy aimed at unwitting pre-schoolers theres a bizarre pervasive desire to want to feel relevant to a strain of internet culture that was already feeling stale by the time the Angry Birds game ever dropped in the App Store. Of course Mighty Eagle dances around to ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" for no reason. Of course Red responds to bad news with a ""Pluck my life."" The humor is too juvenile for audiences other than anyone still teething but this film perpetuates an inexplicable need to invoke memes and neologisms from years when those kids werent even alive yet. READ MORE Why Snapchat Is The New Frontier For Independent Filmmaking These anti-jokes occasionally veer into factual confusion like when a concert meant to ingratiate the pigs with their unsuspecting bird nemeses promises ""Steve Aoinki"" but then shows green swine in Daft Punk helmets. During the pig castle siege twin pigs stand at the end of one hallway chanting ""Redrum"" as if ""The Shining"" only existed as a mislabeled Wikiquotes page. Despite the parade of decade-old references theres one way that ""The Angry Birds Movie"" feels extremely relevant. As rival streaming services fight for hours of material to offer as part of their catalogue this is a prime example of a frivilous piece of childrens entertainment genetically engineered to keep young ones pacified tablet in hand. But if whatever service wins out in this forthcoming battle has nothing but an army of movies like this to offer ""The Angry Birds Movie"" features an apt (and highly publicized) metaphor Mighty Eagle urinating for close to 45 seconds into a body of water dubbed the Lake of Wisdom. Maybe at this point its too much to hope for an animated film like ""The Angry Birds Movie"" to exist as anything other than marketing fodder but hopefully its not too much to ask for that content to have a shred of substance to it.

Reply Dray July 24 2016 1153 am You did Not refer to the title. What I hated Most about this movie anyway is the absolut superficial development of the relationship between red and his ""friends"". When they first met they have nothing to do with each other and Then suddenly they Act like best friends. If you would compare this movie to finding neemo you realise that there is no soul in this movie. But regardless to all this the pantomemic guy Who just says ""oh my god"" is quite funny.

Both children and adults alike will delight in the way Rovios film adaptation of its Angry Birds app amplifies the joys of the original game. FILM REVIEW Angry Birds film just might resurrect the games struggling app maker Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 20 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 20 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly Written by Jon Vitti Starring Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad and Danny McBride Classification PG Country USA Language English At the height of the Angry Birds craze in 2011 I did sometimes wonder if the fury of our feathered friends was actually justified. There was something bruited about stolen eggs but those didnt appear during game play and mainly it seemed the obnoxious little green piggies just deserved to be pelted with digitized avifauna. Still the lack of further explanation was hardly keeping me up nights - nor I suppose was it harming the market for millions of downloads stuffed toys and T-shirts. Now five years later Rovio Entertainment charges in with an animated feature offering 90 minutes of back story. Is the Finnish gamemaker years too late to its own party? Perhaps not. The interesting thing about Angry Birds - at least to those of us who have long since lost interest in gauging the correct angle on the slingshot - is the way the game moved so rapidly across demographics spreading from the back campus to the schoolyard as fast as a dirty joke. When it was introduced in 2009 the iPhone game was a favourite of young adults and teens as smart as their devices; by 2011 it had expanded to other platforms and was beloved of grade-school boys at that sweet transitional stage where they could happily spend the day destroying the pigs houses and the night cuddled up with plush-toy versions of the birds. But it is now 2016 and at the advance screening of the Angry Birds movie that I attended last weekend the most obviously identifiable psychographic in an audience stuffed with young kids was the very little girl in sparkly running shoes.Ostensibly a puzzle game Angry Birds is also a shoot em up and if the world is largely inured to the idea that young men and boys spend hours killing things online the doting parents of little girls are going to demand some hint of a moral precept here - or at least a defensible story of righteous anger and justified revenge.And that is precisely what they get in a lighthearted movie that may yet save Rovio - a one-app pony whose business is stagnating and had to lay off a third of its staff last year - if the new project successfully completes the birds transition from narrow video-game characters into cross-platform pop-culture icons with the capacity for multiple sequels. The film is being released by Sony Pictures but unusually Rovio financed the project itself maintaining creative control over the characters and whatever profits they make rather than simply licensing the IP.So these birds carry heavy responsibilities on their fluffy little wings. Nonetheless they all appear to be blissfully carefree as they waddle about a peaceful island where the very occasional outburst of misbehaviour is met with a stint in anger-management training led by a yogi. There the smart-ass Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) meets two other outsiders Chuck (Josh Gad) and Bomb (Danny McBride.) These new companions stand by the skeptical Red when a boatload of pigs dazzle the welcoming birds with offers of friendship and entertainment.For the adults in the audience there may be an unsettling whiff of colonialism about the arrival of outsiders in ships promising things but veteran writer Jon Vitti (The Simpsons) and animators-turned-directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly handle a potentially yucky plot very gently. The pigs steal off in the night with all the birds eggs and then of course its okay to get angry.With the exception of Red clearly sketched by Sudeikis as a loner and a cynic the characters are not particularly well defined by either the script or the voice actors. Gads Chuck is more frenetic than angry while McBrides Bomb just seems like a gentle giant with a nervous problem involving flatulence.It matters little however as the birds face off against the pigs in an encounter that reproduces the low-tech mechanical aesthetic of the game and unlike many an overwrought animated climax is clever well-paced and satisfying.Of course there are jokes here aimed squarely at the adults. Some are simply distractions such as those piggy versions of the twins from The Shining who appear in one scene. Red very correctly slams a door on that image pronto. Others create fairly amusing running gags The mighty eagle is a superannuated hero whose best days according to the soundtrack were back in the 1970s.But both children and adults will delight in the way the destruction of the pigs island amplifies the joys of the original game. The effect is an amusing reversal of cultural recognition as the role of the icons expands through reproduction rather than contraction. Or from a small childs perspective this Red is even more fun than the bird on Daddys iPhone.And make no mistake this is a movie that is supposed to be seen from the perspective of a small child. It exists in a world where no flightless bird can ever be killed by being hurled to the ground from great heights nor can any pig ever be permanently defeated by a case of exploding TNT. Of course King Pig somehow survives the gleeful demolition - if you are old enough to be reading this the spoiler simply doesnt matter - and as the credits roll promises he is hatching another scheme. If enough little girls in sparkly running shoes love this thing you can be darn sure he and the birds will be back soon to complete the transformation of a cheeky adult game into a winsome kids movie franchise thus ensuring Rovios resurrection.

""The Angry Birds Movie"" has plenty of anger and a lot of birds but the animated comedy never gets off the ground. Photo Rovio Animation Associated Press Angry Birds falls flat despite high-level voice cast 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Heres an exercise after watching ""The Angry Birds Movie"" Try to think of something in the world that might be worse source material for a film than this popular video game. A movie based on a bag of doughnuts if there were a lot of variety would be better. ""Jenga The Movie"" would at least have some built-in suspense. Snow globes? Sugary breakfast cereals? The laminated safety card in the front seat pouch of your most recent plane trip? All have at least as much narrative potential as ""Angry Birds."" The makers of ""The Angry Birds Movie"" cant overcome the fact that their film is based on an app where the lead characters are expendable ammunition. Other than some very recognizable production design a basic birds-versus-pigs premise and a few bars of musical score any ""Angry Birds"" feature must be built from the ground up. And this one is built on a foundation of poop jokes and repetitive cartoon violence. If nothing else the filmmakers did have a great Rolodex. The voice cast is absolutely first rate with a whos who of people youd want to hear providing the dialogue for avian projectiles including Maya Rudolph Peter Dinklage and (well get back to this one later) two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn as the grunting bird Terence. Early-years ""The Simpsons"" writer Jon Vitti sets a cynical tone that occasionally yields a legitimate comic moment. But the joy in this movie is almost always fleeting. Even in the most banal Alvin and the Chipmunks or Smurfs movie there is usually some kind of central moral ""Believe in yourself"" or ""Family is first"" or ""Never stop dreaming."" The apparent takeaway for ""The Angry Birds Movie""? Good things will happen if youre pessimistic and capable of uncontrollable anger. Jason Sudeikis is the voice of Red a perpetually incensed bird who doesnt fit in with the less-enraged fowl in his town. His warnings about a ship full of seemingly fun-loving green pigs arent heeded. When the pigs execute a betrayal Red teams up with members of his anger-management group to save a group of hatchlings. Narrative comedy with the Angry Birds isnt new; the ""Angry Birds Toons"" television show will enter its fourth season in 2016. And ""The Lego Movie"" proved that you can take the flimsiest of concepts and make an enduring piece of animated cinema. But ""The Angry Birds Movie"" clearly didnt have the assets or the motivation for that accomplishment. Instead the filmmakers followed the animated-family-comedy checklist from lesser movies including a groin injury and repetitive battles for the short-attention-spanned kids in the audience and a handful of classic rock songs on the soundtrack as an offering to any bored chaperones. No one will remember this movie in two weeks but it leaves just enough of a warm feeling that the masses might mindlessly come back for a sequel. All of the above may describe a good app but its not a good movie. The game ""Angry Birds"" at its core is a destination for switching off your brain. And movies even throw-away summer animated kid films should aim for something more. Now back to Sean Penn for a moment. Although were strongly resolved never to watch ""The Angry Birds Movie"" again we will purchase the DVD/ Blu-ray at full price if the ""bonus materials"" disc answers the following questions Did Sean Penn because of his five Academy Award nominations and two wins get to choose which bird he voiced? Did Penn and Mexican drug lord El Chapo talk about ""Angry Birds"" during their interview/profile for Rolling Stone? What kind of bonus does a casting director get for acquiring one of the greatest actors of a generation to voice a bird in an animated movie based on an app? (Not a shot against Penn either way. Orson Welles voiced a robot in a 1980s ""Transformers"" animated movie and if anything it added to his legend.) Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicle pop culture critic.

Credit Columbia Pictures As motion pictures adapted from video games go ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is leagues superior to say 1993s ""Super Mario Bros."" This new movie which uses the bright color-rich palette of the smartphone phenom for which its named as well as its hook of nonaeronautic feathered creatures getting around via catapult is not much beyond a superficially amiable ball of fluff. Video Trailer The Angry Birds Movie A preview of the film. By SONY PICTURES on Publish Date April 16 2016. Photo by Columbia Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed At the top of a voluminous and talent-rich voice cast (which alas neglects to include the maestros of irate sarcasm Don Rickles and Nicky Katt) Jason Sudeikis portrays Red the irascible odd bird out in a community of irrationally upbeat avian neighbors. From across the sea comes a ship with a couple of friendly-seeming green pigs at its helm. They carry an initially secret stash of more green pigs a diverting and entertaining lot that is eagerly embraced in bird land. Red however believes that his fellow nonfliers havent figured out whats going on and he turns out to be right.I shall not wax too indignant over the fact that this ostensible childrens entertainment in this summer of all summers could easily be taken as an anti-immigration fable. Instead I shall note that once past its pleasant echoes of cartoon classics like ""Birds Anonymous"" and ""Cured Duck"" (a great showcase for the original angry bird name of Donald) the movie directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis settles into the current default mode of animation humor. That is a DreamWorks-inflected pop-culture ""savvy"" far-side-of-smarm (not too) smart-aleckness replete with bodily function jokes. The kids of today deserve better. So do I come to think of it.GLENN KENNY""The Angry Birds Movie"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for gas urine mucus and coy innuendo.

Smartphone apps dont particularly lend themselves well to political allegory or satire. But thats precisely what the makers of this fitfully amusing animated adaptation of the once-popular game seem to be fruitlessly attempting. Rebelling against Bird Islands liberal everyone-gets-along philosophy by acting out cardinal Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) is sentenced to an anger management class led by Matilda (Maya Rudolph as the closest thing to a major female character). His classmates are fellow avian rebels against political correctness Chuck (Josh Gad) and the literally explosive Bomb (Danny McBride). Red is the only one whos suspicious when a band of seemingly friendly singing-and-dancing green pigs (immigrants) led by Leonard (Bill Hader) come ashore. And sure enough Reds proven right when they steal the birds eggs (the unborn) and set sail for home to feast on them. So Red and his pals enlist the help of the egotistical and more-than-slightly Trump-ian Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) who at one point takes a lengthy leak into a lake. Our tantrum-prone heroes follow the pigs back to Pig Island -- where they rescue the eggs and taking their cue from Ted Cruz proceed to bomb the intruders back to the Stone Age. Parents of 5-year-olds you have been warned.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jen Chaney May 19 Follow chaneyj Have you ever wondered why these birds are so angry? No? ""The Angry Birds Movie"" tells you anyway. And it provides a lesson in colonialism. (Rovio Animation/Columbia Pictures ) Hollywood is so hungry for movie franchises that it will seek inspiration from almost any source. Thats the only conceivable explanation for ""The Angry Birds Movie"" which is best described as a mobile-gaming apps origin story. An animated adventure based on Angry Birds -- the app that has spawned enough branded merchandise to fill every Rubbermaid storage bin in the country -- isnt the worst idea ever. Conceptually its no more ridiculous than movies inspired by plastic construction bricks or pirate-themed amusement-park rides. The problem with ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is that unlike ""The Lego Movie"" or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films it doesnt take an existing product as a jumping-off point to spin a more imaginative yarn. Instead it assumes that its audience has been just dying to find out how and why all those birds that live in our phones started slingshotting themselves into evil pigs and crates of TNT in the first place. But does anyone really care? Its doubtful that even the most addicted Angry Birds fan ever paused the game to wonder ""But why are they so . . . so angry?"" [2016 Summer Movie Guide Heroes sequels reboots and blockbusters] Initially the movie takes a more personal route toward answering that question by focusing on Red (voice of Jason Sudeikis) a beetle-browed avian who has a hard time keeping his cool. Red works as a clown at birthday parties (an odd career choice for someone with a temper). After a heated argument with a dissatisfied customer he winds up in court where hes sentenced to attend anger-management classes alongside other feathered hotheads who cant keep their beaks shut. Based on the popular video game series this 3D animated comedy reveals why the birds are so angry. (Sony Pictures) Before Red makes too much progress a bunch of pigs on a ship sail smack into the birds home island insisting that they just want to hang out and become friends. Red warns the community that the pigs might try to take control of their home but given his tendency to burst into irrational rages no one listens. Thats right. ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is an exploration of the effects of colonialism. Your kids will probably learn a lot about that subject once they stop laughing at the part where the character of Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) -- an in-app purchase whos been turned into a revered hero in the movie -- urinates into a mountain stream for a full minute. The movies humor consistently aims low despite the fact that Jon Vitti the veteran television writer who worked on both ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Larry Sanders Show"" wrote the script. Occasionally there are some clever touches. Matilda (Maya Rudolph) the ultra-Zenlike anger-management instructor describes herself as a ""free-rage chicken"" while a courtroom sketch artist taps out portraits using her beak. Overall however the laughs are scant. This is especially disappointing considering the voice cast which is studded with such comic greats as Josh Gad Danny McBride Bill Hader Kate McKinnon Keegan-Michael Key and er Sean Penn. In his role as a gargantuan bird named Terence the actor literally does nothing but grunt -- albeit with the kind of world-class nuance that won him an Academy Award for ""Mystic River."" Ultimately ""The Angry Birds Movie"" exists so that the audience can experience in widescreen what it feels like to play the game. In scenes in which Hal (the boomerang bird) or Bubbles (the orange bird who expands once dropped on a target) zoom through the CGI air the film is actually kind of fun. But those few moments still cant justify a theatrical feature. After paying good money to take your family to see this film you may be dealing with some anger-management issues of your own. PG. At area theaters. Contains rude humor and action. 90 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Updated July 30 2016  253 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies The Angry Birds Movie is less fun than the game By Jody Mitori Special to Go Magazine May 19 2016 (...) In ""The Angry Birds Movie"" an angry bird doles out some slingshot strategy ""Just look where the last bird went and adjust from there."" The line is a blatant reminder that this film is based on a game a smartphone app that has sucked away hours of once-productive peoples time.Its also a reminder that the game is a lot more fun than the movie.For the uninitiated in the app a player catapults a series of birds to try to destroy green pigs to get back their eggs. That pretty much sums up the movie too with a few jokes thrown in. Jason Sudeikis is the voice of Red who is bitter because hes been mocked over the years for his big eyebrows and his family-less existence. The quick-tempered fowl flies into a rage at a childrens birthday party and is ordered to attend anger management training.At his first meeting he meets other birds familiar to ""Angry"" players. The back stories of yellow triangle-shaped Chuck (voiced by Josh Gad) big round Terence (Sean Penn) and bomb-shaped Bomb (Danny McBride) are revealed in the group circle. The fast-talking Gad aka Olaf from ""Frozen"" has the funniest delivery of the flock. Red doesnt much care for the other birds and returns to his lonely house on the beach where he sees a ship approaching Bird Island. Two green pigs disembark a species the birds have never seen before. While the other birds want to welcome the pigs Red is immediately suspicious. He sneaks onto the ship and finds more pigs hidden away.Soon the pigs are infiltrating bird land so Red and his friends seek out the legendary Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) for help in defending their territory. First-time directors and veteran animators Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis pace the film unevenly with musical numbers popping up to fill the time until the inevitable battle between birds and pigs. In the app you dont have to wait an hour to get to the action.The movie is ultimately a 90-minute commercial with vivid colors and other cuddly game characters popping up along the way. In that goal it succeeds After the closing credits it is hard to resist turning on an iPhone to play just one quick game. Lets just hope ""The Candy Crush Movie"" doesnt hit theaters any time soon.What ""The Angry Birds Movie""  Two stars out of four  Run time 130  Rating PG  Content Cartoon violence and some mild rude humor Tags Jody Mitori Angry Birds The Angry Birds Movie View (...) comments Most popular Old Standard Fried Chicken will close this weekend Smash-and-grab burglars hit original Sweetie Pies location in Dellwood Mellow Mushroom pizzeria opens in Sunset Hills Half-century-old Webster Groves Bookshop is closing Today in Pokemon Go Shootout in Vegas security risk in Israel finding Yuri in Russia Latest Disney movies help autistic boy find his voice in Life Animated Woody Allens Cafe Society is a bittersweet treat A trio of misfit mothers lose control in Bad Moms Jason Bourne is back doing what he does best Eat That Question taps into Frank Zappa Quick links Comics/games Movie times Pop off forum Reel Time movie forum TV listings The Blender Tube Talk Sign up For Go Sneak Peek Pick up this Sundays paper for the Craft Beer Special Section Get your tickets for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Arts + Craft Brewfest See ads from todays newspaper Manage your services Feast Magazine Ladue News St. Louis Best Bridal STL High School Sports Products and features Apps Archives Calendar Chats Comics amp; games Contests E-edition Forums Newsletters Our events Press releases Tools and services Advertise with us Autos Classifieds Contact us Homes Jobs Newspapers in Education Page reprints Post-Dispatch store Site help Subscriber services (c) Copyright 2016 STLtoday.com 900 N.

USA TODAYAs an exercise in corporate brand-building its no ""Lego Movie.""Matilda (Maya Rudolph) peacefully channels her anger in ""The Angry Birds Movie.""(Photo Rovio Animation)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 out of 5 starsFor those stalwart souls who have resisted one of the great time wasters of the iPhone era Angry Birds is a puzzle game in which the player uses to a virtual slingshot to launch a barrage of cartoon birds as missiles. Their target ugly-cute green pigs who have stolen their eggs.First released in 2010 the app became a pop-culture phenomenon spawning toys T-shirts backpacks and theme-park attractions. All of this made ""The Angry Birds Movie"" which hits theaters on Friday May 20 inevitable. Yet it is no small task turning cutesy game icons -- which were used to seeing at the millimeter scale -- into larger-than-life characters with quirks backstories and narrative arcs that go beyond their catapult trajectories.RELATED The big guide to summer moviesScreenwriter Jon Vitti and first-time directors Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis certainly give it a try but their bag of tricks is mostly recycled and their sense of humor is aimed squarely at 12-year-old boys.Hatchlings from ""The Angry Birds Movie"" are having some fun. (Photo Rovio Animation)The opening action sequence is straight out of the ""Ice Age"" movies except instead of a saber-toothed squirrel with an acorn its Red -- a squat flightless bird with Groucho Marx eyebrows and the voice of Jason Sudeikis -- racing to deliver a ""hatch day"" present. After the client takes issue with his tardiness Red loses his temper and winds up in anger-management class where he meets Chuck (Josh Gad) a yellow bird with Flash speed and Bomb (Danny McBride) who literally blows up when he gets mad.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceAs the archetypal lonely outsider Red is the only bird on the island who is suspicious when a ship arrives with a crew of roly-poly piggies led by Leonard (Bill Hader). As for the rest of the villagers anyone who isnt wowed by the newcomers high-tech gadgets (especially the all-important slingshot) is won over by their stage show a sort of Country Thunder From Down Under with hip-swiveling piggies wearing shall we say ham-less chaps.Red (Jason Sudeikis) enjoys lunch alone in the park in ""The Angry Birds Movie."" (Photo Rovio Animation)Thats the level of comedy throughout the film which is packed with bad puns (""Pluck my life"") and other mildly risque material designed to make older kids giggle while sailing over the heads of their younger siblings. Some of the sight gags are based on bird biology as when a mommy bird packs lunch for her kids by regurgitating it although others ignore the facts of avian life (such as Birds dont pee).In a sure sign of a premise running thin there are numerous utterly irrelevant pop-culture references including a two-second clip parodying ""The Shining"" (""Red rum"").Find out why our avian pals are angry in ""The Angry Birds Movie."" (Photo Rovio Animation)Eventually of course the pigs nefarious purpose (see first paragraph above) is revealed and its up to Red to save the day by turning himself and his neighbors into missiles raining feathery terror down on the pigs city. If youre a fan of Angry Birds its definitely fun to see the game mechanics blown up to cinematic scale. So much so in fact that it makes the buildup -- the budding friendships and the heart-tugging flashbacks -- seem all the more obligatory even superfluous.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestTwo years ago ""The Lego Movie"" proved once and for all that just because a film is a transparent exercise in corporate brand expansion doesnt mean it cant have heart.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over the course of hundreds of classic animated shorts certain gags--like walking on air before plummeting to the ground--used to recur across different series or even studios. It makes sense that some of that general cartoon language would be revised and replaced with new conventions for the era of computer animation. Its a shame though that so many of these new recurring gags are barely gags at all--just a series of hacky reflexes that viewers particularly kids have been trained to find funny.For example a lot of animated movies break into ultra-slow-motion for moments of slapstick complete with slowed-down vocals. This happens no fewer than four times during The Angry Birds Movie including twice in the first 10 minutes. Why is this supposed to be funny? In these particular cases it doesnt add more detail to the cartoon pratfalls. It only belabors them while depriving the movies potential for breathless speed. But again and again Angry Birds returns to the well assuming that imitating the way other cartoons look or making a goofy noise will cause something funny to just kind of happen. And for kids such cynical prompting may well work.Like a lot of modern studio animation The Angry Birds Movie wants to cynically prompt adults too so families can share the experience of being duped. For this portion of the audience the movie recruits a truly impressive roster of comic talent to provide voice work sometimes for only a few lines Jason Sudeikis Bill Hader Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Kate McKinnon Peter Dinklage Keegan-Michael Key Tony Hale Jillian Bell Tituss Burgess Hannibal Buress and Ike Barinholtz all play birds and pigs derived from the popular mobile phone game. Theres only so much voice actors can do to juice animated gags of course but the screenplay matches this comic-heavy cast with Jon Vitti who wrote for The Simpsons Saturday Night Live and The Office among shows that match the comic pedigree of this cast. Unfortunately the Vitti who clocks in to write jokes for birds based on a mobile phone game is apparently the same Vitti whose name is on some of the recent Alvin And The Chipmunks movies which means he barely writes jokes at all. In their place are cutesy buzz phrases out of a bad sitcom ""good talk"" ""spoiler alert"" ""TMI."" Its a minor miracle that no one says ""dont go there"" or ""awk-ward""The movies dialogue is so generic that Red (Sudeikis) the outcast bird with the furrowed furry eyebrows barely registers as angry. It turns out the Jason Sudeikis persona isnt all that compatible with a simmering rage; the movie insists that Red has antisocial levels of fury but most of the time he lands somewhere between sarcastic and put-upon. Early in the movie Red is sent to anger management class where he meets the even less angry Chuck (Josh Gad) and Bomb (McBride). Their therapy sessions are interrupted by the arrival of Leonard (Hader amusingly smarmy) a pig leading an expedition to the birds island. Most of the bird population welcomes the pigs while Red regards them with skepticism. Eventually Red Chuck and Bomb seek out the islands iconic Great Eagle (Dinklage the only actor besides Hader who gets a few chuckles) to find out how to thwart the pigs secret nefarious plans.Because this is all a perfunctory way to imitate the birds-versus-pigs gameplay the movie gives seemingly little thought to what its telling kids (or for that matter adults). This is a story where the heros suspicion of visitors who dont look or act like the species he knows proves correct when its revealed that theyve arrived on the birds island to kidnap and devour their children. It turns out that the most authentically angry thing about Red is his unspoken but clear isolationist streak and mistrust of immigrants.With its ugly character designs and ugly story both chained to the games aesthetics--Sony made this movie but not through the talented in-house studio that animated Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs--all thats left are the incidental gags most of which are woeful. Some of them barely make sense like when Red Chuck and Bomb climb up the wrong mountain in search of the Great Eagle and the movie then breaks into time-lapse footage of Bomb just sitting there for some reason. Other attempts at mirth are mercenary even for a movie based on a video game as when the pigs delight their bird hosts by putting on a ""cowboy show"" for the sole reason of inserting a Blake Shelton single that will play again over the movies dance-party end credits. In other words its all arbitrary--and not because of cartoon whims but because most of the movie is lazily retrofitted for a variety of marketing opportunities. Some kids will probably like it anyway. But some kids also like toy commercials and singing chipmunks. It doesnt mean they should actually watch them.

EntertainmentMovies The Angry Birds Movie takes aim at young kids -- and wins Originally published May 19 2016 at 1200 am Updated May 19 2016 at 244 pm Movie review of ""The Angry Birds Movie"" Origin story of popular game is cute and has its moments but the film isnt likely to draw an audience beyond the grade-school set. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Sometimes a movie critic needs a bit of extra help and for ""The Angry Birds Movie"" I required the assistance of Matt an 11-year-old ""Angry Birds"" expert. He gave me a crash course so to speak in the game just before the screening and afterward pronounced the movie ""a solid three stars"" while acknowledging that ""a lot of it could have been a little better."" (Story of my life kid.) Without his help I might well have found ""The Angry Birds Movie"" agreeable but utterly mystifying. (A slingshot? Why?) In context the movie has its moments but its not likely to draw much of an audience beyond the grade-school set Its an origin story for a video game told with the usual assortment of movie-star voices and kid-friendly jokes involving butts pratfalls and pig-related puns. So help me I giggled at ""Hamnesty International."" Told in unnecessary 3D the story takes place on Bird Island where all the businesses have cute avian names (i.e. Birds amp; Bees Fertility Clinic) and all the flightless birds are inordinately cheerful. The exception is cranky Red who sports impressive Martin Scorsese eyebrows and is voiced by Jason Sudeikis. (Hes fine but am I wrong in wishing Russell Crowe had this role?) With Chuck (Josh Gad) and Bomb (Danny McBride) two fellow outsiders he meets in anger-management class Red must find his inner bird -- not to mention that slingshot -- when a gang of mysterious egg-stealing pigs invade the island. Movie Review 1/2   The Angry Birds Movie with the voices of Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Kate McKinnon Sean Penn Tony Hale Keegan-Michael Key Bill Hader Peter Dinklage. Directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis from a screenplay by Jon Vitti. 95 minutes. Rated PG for rude humor and action. Several theaters. The world gets saved at least for the moment; more importantly the random French-mime bird survives to gesticulate another day. (Is he in the video game? Can he please have his own movie franchise?) Though Matt and I disagreed a tad on the overall star rating we laughed enough while watching it to rate the movie thumbs-up if not a must-see. In other words ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is unnecessary but cute like a bonnet on a cat -- and there are certainly worse recommendations than that.

The Angry Birds Movie is both a big-screen 3D attempt to cash in on a huge mobile app phenom and a funny ha-ha excuse to party down at the multiplex. The movie is not interactive. Theres no touchscreen or digital slingshot that lets you hurl angry wingless birds at the green pigs whove stolen their eggs. But vengeance is still part of the deal. First-time directors Clay Katis and Fergal Reilly give this animated joyride an eye-popping visual palette and an all-star cast of voice actors to bring this origin story to life.

Red is ordered to attend anger management classes conducted by Matilda (Maya Rudolph) who calls herself  a ""free rage chicken."" If you like puns the script by Jon Vitti (Alvin and the Chipmunks) has a million groaners. It also has other ragers including canary Chuck (Josh Gad) blackbird Bomb (Danny McBride) and Terrence a feathered assault weapon hilariously growled by Sean Penn. Even with a support team Red still gets ignored when an army of green pigs led by Leonard (Bill Hader) hit Bird Island pretending to be friends. For advice Red turns to bird guru Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) but Red is on his own until the oinkers start stealing bird eggs. Then its war. Theres nothing brutal or bloody to scare off the Candy Crushers. Theres also nothing as iconic as the ingenious deviltry youll find in The Lego Movie. Its hard to hide the fact that Angry Birds has been repackaged way past the time when the game was a peak obsession.

In theaters May 2016. (Credit Sony Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The critters of the gaming app Angry Birds come to animated life. CAST Voices of Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Bill HaderRATED PG (rude humor mild innuendo)LENGTH 137BOTTOM LINE Somewhere between movie and commercial but mostly harmless and occasionally fun. Once upon a time there was an island of birds whose eggs were stolen by little green pigs. Because the birds could not fly they used a giant slingshot to launch themselves at the piggies. Some of the birds even exploded upon impact After a great battle the birds conquered the pigs rescued their eggs and lived happily ever after. Thats the completely nonsensical story of ""The Angry Birds Movie"" and there are two kinds of people who probably wont quibble with it adults addicted to the mobile gaming app Angry Birds upon which this movie is based and children too young to quibble with anything. Others may find that ""The Angry Birds Movie"" hovers somewhere between half-baked fairy tale and full-on advertisement though in the end its mostly harmless and occasionally fun. advertisement | advertise on newsday The movies hero is Red a kind of squat cardinal with distinctively bushy eyebrows and the sardonic voice of Jason Sudeikis. Hes a social outcast whos been sentenced to anger-management class with three other miscreants the manic Chuck (Josh Gad) the massive Terence (Sean Penn grumbling wordlessly) and the literally explosive Bomb (Danny McBride). When those green piggies come to visit led by the glad-handing Leonard (an excellent Bill Hader) only Red and his furious friends can see through their friendly act. StoryAngry Birds Movie set for big box office debut SUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 Its rather refreshing to see anger and distrust extolled as virtues in a childrens movie. In a grown-up version of this story Red would be the raving conspiracy theorist who turns out to be right and we cant help but simmer along with him as the piggies hoodwink the islands other birdbrains. When every precious egg on the island vanishes Red leads the charge to get them back. The movies story by John Cohen is pretty thin gruel but Jon Vittis smart-aleck script can be quite funny and the brightly colored animation is appealing. (Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis are the films directors.) The voice cast including Peter Dinklage as the washed-up hero Mighty Eagle is also fine even if females are in oddly short supply. In all ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is a lot like the game not thematically rich or emotionally resonant but itll pass the time.

Building on the games bare-bones premise (see bird; slingshot bird into pig fortress for points; repeat) the 3-D animated film delivers a mildly diverting mix of winky meta-jokes and moral lessons cannily aimed at both the next generation of tiny consumers and their more sophisticated parents. Jason Sudeikis lends his voice to Red a squat crimson ball of avian rage Everything from rude sneezers to slow crosswalks makes his feathered fists clench and his eyebrows knit like mad charcoal briquettes. Hes a lonely little jerk an odd bird out but his cynicism also leads him to rightly suspect an arriving squadron of pea green swine (led by Bill Haders lugubrious Leonard) of having less-than-friendly intentions. They say they come in peace but what they really want is to steal the communitys eggs and eat them all because theyre well pigs. Can Red step up and save the day before the islands future offspring are turned into omelets? Can the audience endure 1001 pork puns and flock-you cracks in the interim? The answer to both questions is a solid-enough yes that Birds wont likely be the last app-to-movie adaptation. Your move Candy Crush.

A smartphone game becomes a film and lays an egg. Directors Clay Katis Fergal Reilly. (137). PG Bathroom humor. Area theaters. ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is just fowl. What used to be a silly game for two thumbs and five minutes -- you take these flightless birds see and throw them at pigs -- is now a big loud full-length feature. And its nothing to crow about. Really who ever thought ""Angry Birds"" was a good idea for a movie? And what are they thinking up next ""The Words With Friends Chronicles?"" Its a product only a marketing division could love as a simple time-waster is blown up into a too-long too-crude cartoon full of celebrity voices a geezer-rock soundtrack and cheap thrills. Feather in Their Crap Chuck (Josh Gad) Red (Jason Sudeikis) and Bomb (Danny McBride) in ""Angry Birds."" (Columbia Pictures and Rovio) First we get half an hour of backstory and character development -- because you really needed to know just what made that little red bird so angry didnt you? Then all these pigs invade and steal the birds eggs. After that its just screaming and folks throwing things. Oh wait. That was me. The animation -- stuck as it is with the original crude character design -- is rarely more than ugly. The attempts to provide a positive Disney-style message never take flight (anger is bad -- except when its not). And while no one should be desperate enough to be searching ""The Angry Birds Movie"" for a role model couldnt we have at least one strong female character? Green Ham and Eggs Ross (Tony Hale) Stella (Kate McKinnon) Photog (Tituss Burgess) and Earl (Blake Shelton) add to the celebrity stars to give voice to a lame movie. (Rovio Animation) Our five heroes are all male -- voiced by Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Peter Dinklage and a grunting Sean Penn. The swinish villain? Another guy given life by Bill Hader. In fact the only notable female cast member is Maya Rudolph -- and she plays an annoying touchy-feely anger-management counselor who the other characters simply roll their big cartoon eyes at. Because who needs these chicks anyway? Really its enough to make you want to turn them all into capons. Or just hurl yourself into a theater showing another movie.

"Angry Birds review Feather-light charmer provides backstory for avian fury - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Angry Birds review Feather-light charmer provides backstory for avian fury Trailer The Angry Birds Movie In the 3D animated comedy The Angry Birds Movie well finally find out why the birds are so angry. (Sony Pictures) In theaters May 20 2016 In the 3D animated comedy The Angry Birds Movie well finally find out why the birds are so angry. (Sony Pictures) In theaters May 20 2016 Katie WalshTribune News Service If youve ever played the mobile video game Angry Birds you might have found yourself wondering -- why am I sling-shotting cartoon birds at grinning green pigs? Why are these birds so angry? What have the pigs done to deserve this destruction? ""Angry Birds"" the movie is here to fill in that backstory to answer the questions that may or may not have been asked and provide motivation for the avian rage. The film directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly from a screenplay by ""Simpsons"" writer Jon Vitti proves to be more than just a gimmick and doesnt skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob-shaped flightless birds battling pigs.Jason Sudeikis lends his voice talents to the angriest of the birds Red and his snarky sardonic delivery is perfect for the character. Hes the red one per the name with the perpetually V-shaped eyebrows. Those brows are the source of some angst having been teased about them as a kid. That early torment has led to his current worldview as a perpetual victim whom the world is out to get an oddball and loner with a short fuse who doesnt fit in on the happy-go-lucky paradise island where he and all the other flightless birds live. RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURHe doesnt even fit in during his court-mandated anger management classes. ""Angry Birds"" somehow balances those recognizable real-world elements with all-out fantastical silliness and that contrast lends itself to the films weird charm. Zenned-out Matilda (Maya Rudolph) teaches the islands other angry birds in attendance -- the speedy motormouth Chuck (Josh Gad) uncontrollably explosive Bomb (Danny McBride) and intimidating but silent Terence (Sean Penn) who only growls. The emotional foundation of bullying and loneliness is almost too humane for a film that features a razzle dazzle cowboy dance number performed by enthusiastic and energetic green pigs. The porky pirates arrive one day in an enormous ship led by the swaggering Southern-accented Leonard (Bill Hader) bearing tropical banquets and dance parties with DJs named Daft Piggy sweeping the birds off their feet with entertainment and hoopla.Reds the only skeptic in the bunch trained by years of expecting the worst from others. Also hes finally in a position where hes actually being oppressed -- the pigs parked their boat right on his house. But his suspicion is ignored and soon the overbearing porcine partiers make off with the birds precious eggs their children for a feast on Piggy Island.So while the plot just might put some kids off eating eggs (are they baby birds or protein-rich snacks?) the themes at play in ""Angry Birds"" are surprisingly somewhat nuanced. The story demonstrates how certain traits -- Chucks speed Reds anger Bombs well bombastic qualities -- might be looked down upon by societys norms but can be strengths when harnessed in the right way like in a bird slingshot.Peter Dinklage voices the fantastically vainglorious over-the-hill Mighty Eagle whom Red idolizes and hopes will save them from the pigs. When it turns out hes just a paunchy braggart who cant fly Red realizes with exasperation that ""the fate of the world relies on idiots like me."" That message is all too relatable -- the fate of the world relies on idiots like all of us.

But has it come too late? Not as bad as it shouldve been. Thats not exactly overwhelming praise but its about all this shameless occasionally entertaining cash-in deserves. Arriving a good couple of years after the smartphone game Angry Birds hit peak addiction the animated movie spin-off takes the basic idea of coloured birds slingshotting themselves at devious pigs (if youve not played it why on Earth are you reading this?) and transforms it into a brash sarcastic just-about-family-friendly adventure. Theres more than a hint of Cars in the set-up which takes place on an island paradise entirely populated by flightless birds that talk and act like suburban Americans. The only bird not happy with his lot is Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) whose inability to control his temper sees him sentenced to anger management classes. However Reds rage comes in handy when the island is invaded by boatloads of apparently friendly pigs. The porkers fondness for trampolining and party tunes hides their lust for the one thing they dont have on their own island eggs. If you loved the game you might enjoy watching the script contort itself into ever more zany shapes to incorporate the necessary elements giant slings teetering towers boomeranging toucans. But its not enough to counteract the tiresome sub-Lego Movie snarkiness of the script or the bright busy and unengaging animation.

TWITTER 5/20/2016 The beaky buddies from the best-selling video game vault themselves onto the big screen with this adaptation featuring the voices of Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad and Maya Rudolph. If you imagine the arena of theatrical film releasing as a huge games arcade then computer game-to-film adaptation Ratchet and Clank released in the U.S. by Focus Features is the weedy kid whose feeble high score is about to be annihilated by a cocky rival The Angry Birds Movie. This animated feature directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Katis is based on an already hugely successful franchise (if now fading from playground favor) first launched by Finnish game company Rovio in 2009 and which has already spawned a series of cartoon shorts. The brightly colored quirkily humorous games puzzle-oriented but grounded around angles arcs and brute Newtonian physics cannily appealed to every quadrant of the demographic map even moms. So this cinematic origin story has a massive fan base to draw on arguably bigger than those for the upcoming adaptations of the more macho combat games Warcraft and Assassins Creed. All Sony has to do to make a substantial summer hit out of this is not mess it up. Fortunately for this recently often unlucky company The Angry Birds Movie is way better than most viewers would expect. That said expectations are probably pretty low given the ground-grazing bar set by the majority of game-to-film adaptations. Even for onlookers whove never played any of the games the whole concept isnt even ""so last year"" its so 2011. Admittedly the storytelling is not in the league of Pixar or Disney at their best and with the male-dominated cast its a bit embarrassingly retrograde in terms of gender balance even compared with Ratchet. But the animation punches well above its weight with properly Looney Tunes-standard sight gags; polished highly expressive character design; and rendering so intensely computed nearly every barbule and rachis on each individual feather is visible. Given that theres such a paucity of narrative in the original games and the shorts are nearly dialogue-free and all about slapstick anyway the screenplay by Jon Vitti (Alvin and the Chipmunks) based on a story credited to John Cohen Mikael Hed and David Maisel hasnt got much material with which to build up characters from the start. (Mind you The Lego Movie probably had even less to work with.) Vittis script sets out to answer the core existential question many might have asked themselves Why are these birds so angry? Why dont they fly? And whats with the green pigs? We never do find out exactly why theyre all flightless birds but it turns out that life on Bird Island is by and large fairly content peaceful and good-natured. So much so that naturally testy-tempered cardinal Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) is made to feel like a social outcast among the happy-clappy residents and is ordered by the court to attend anger-management classes run by Matilda (Maya Rudolph) an indeterminate species with pretty mauve-colored plumage but her own barely suppressed issues. Reds fellow students include Chuck (Josh Gad) a hyperactive yellow canary and Bomb (Danny McBride) a usually placid blackbird who has a long fuse (literally) but little control of when he explodes. Finally theres massive monosyllabic bruiser Terrence who is voiced by Sean Penn (a bizarre accidental irony given that he just won an apology and settlement toward the charity of his choice from Lee Daniels for accusing him of unproven domestic violence). One day a ship covered in gears and tracks and sporting a massive wrecking ball pulls into the harbor. It is captained by Leonard (Bill Hader) a green pig whose beard-but-no-mustache hipster facial hair immediately marks him as dubious. Only Red is suspicious when Leonard and his crew mates whose numbers swell at an alarming rate start dispensing free food and catapults to help them fly and sure enough it turns out one should always beware of pigs bearing gifts. The visitors steal that which is most precious to the birds and Red ends up leading an attack on their citadel using the very catapult the swine left behind. Given the need to keep things simple for younger viewers the filmmakers were probably compelled to ensure the plot traces a simple trajectory a smooth parabola that guarantees what comes up must come down. But despite the predictable parameters theres room for some wry adult-aimed humor that adds zest allusions to films like The Shining and classic Tex Avery gags; meta references to photo-bombing and spoilers; and best of all gags that play on the avian nature of the characters. For instance at one point Red rallies the troops by reminding them how theyre descended from dinosaurs. Elsewhere a mommy bird prepares her chicks lunches the way any bird-brained matriarch would by regurgitating into paper bags. If the screenplay verges a little too much on the homiletic with messages about family and accepting who you are in terms of storyboard-storytelling (a specialty of co-director Reilly) the quality of visual imagination is very high. Befitting of the nature of the original games spatial relationships are exceedingly clear and the intricate Rube Goldberg-like structures the films world builds up make sense mechanically right up to the moment they get blown to smithereens. At one point early on in the pic the anger-management students are encouraged to draw in order to vent their frustrations and Red drafts a series of storyboards showing Leonard skewered and pummeled and broken. ""I call this one Catharsis"" he says revealing the gory last picture. If thats the way it works for animators the team who made this deliciously violent cartoony work must be the most chilled-out crew in the business.

But as ""Clue"" co-star Michael McKean noted years later ""Theres a very good movie called The Set-Up Robert Wise boxing picture which is based on a poem thats barely one page long about a boxing match. You could make a good movie or a sh-tty one based on anything."" So lets be clear then ""The Angry Birds Movie"" isnt pointless because its based on an app. Its pointless because its pointless. And if were supposed to forgive this brightly colored and loud affair because its aimed at children then good luck to parents who have to explain lines like ""Pluck my life"" to say nothing of a resolution in which rage-fueled violence and destruction solves all dilemmas. See Video Angry Birds Movie Trailer Finds Bearded Pigs Invading Feathered Paradise (This film also has some sort of tie-in happening with the United Nations global sustainability efforts a strange choice given that the story is about how visitors who are different than you are literally only interested in stealing your babies and eating them.) None of the birds here can fly but that doesnt seem to be a problem since they all live on an island that they think is alone in all the world and they feel secure because the legendary Mighty Eagle is watching over all of them. Mighty Eagle may be about the only thing left that Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) believes in but then as an orphan he never had parents to tell him that the big bird is probably a myth. (A jumbled series of flashbacks under the opening credits show Red hatching in a Lost and Found.) Also Read Justin Lin in Talks to Direct Space Jam 2 Starring LeBron James As one of the islands few non-complacent birds Reds temper constantly gets him into trouble with pompous Judge Peckinpah (Keegan-Michael Key) ultimately sending him off to an anger-management course taught by Matilda (Maya Rudolph). His classmates include Bomb (Danny McBride) who can literally explode although he doesnt harm himself; motor-mouthed hyperkinetic Chuck (Josh Gad); and behemoth bird Terence who only grunts. (The grunting makes this a Method actors dream gig so its no surprise they cast Sean Penn.) When some green pigs led by Leonard (Bill Hader) come ashore in full we-are-your-friends mode Red is the only one whos suspicious but since hes already a pariah no one pays any attention. Red travels with Chuck and Bomb to find Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) but in true ""Wizard of Oz"" fashion supposedly all-powerful recluses usually arent much help. Its not until the pigs enact their horrible scheme that everyone looks to Red and his fury for guidance leading to a third act that is I imagine where the movie starts reenacting the game. (Never played it; more of a Candy Crush Soda Saga guy myself.) ""The Angry Birds Movie"" basically hits all the squares on the Lazily Conceived Family Cartoon bingo card from a tsunami of pop culture references (the ones that touch upon ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and ""The Shining"" are presumably meant to keep parents awake) to some of the most obvious pop song choices ever up to and including Rick Astleys ""Never Gonna Give You Up."" Also Read Sonys Animated Emoji Movie Integrates Spotify Major Smartphone Apps in Plot (Exclusive) Writer Jon Vitti (a TV vet whose big-screen work runs the gamut from ""The Simpsons Movie"" to ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"") never takes the leaps and bounds with the material that made ""The Lego Movie"" so beloved by so many; unlikely source material is no excuse to make a film thats so patently by-the-numbers. Even though directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly (two first-timers with lengthy animation credits between them) make this world lush and colorful the frantic pacing doesnt help. Nor does the next-level scatology -- in addition to the usual fart and butt jokes we get a urination gag that includes visible urine. Again have fun mom and dad. A screenwriter friend tells an anecdote about a colleague of his who went in for a studio pitch meeting only to be told that the company was less interested in storytelling than in brand management. ""The Angry Birds Movie"" and Sonys announced/threatened upcoming ""Emojis"" cartoon represent game-changing triumphs for marketers and accountants everywhere. As for moviegoers weve just been encouraged to spend 90 minutes playing with our phones instead.

Toy Story 2 (1999) Wherein we learn that toys need to be taken out of their mint packaging and loved if theyre to be truly happy. And that a Sarah McLachlan song about a doll who misses being cared for by her owner can reduce grown men to sobbing. 4. Finding Nemo (2003) Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres have the precision timing of a vaudeville comedy duo as two tiny fish who brave the big wide ocean to rescue a missing youngster. This parable about the push and pull of parent-child dependency offers some of Pixars finest blending of adventure and comedy. 5. Toy Story (1995) The one that started it all and kick-started a whole new way of making cartoons. Its characters became instant icons while its gleaming surfaces changed animation more than any other single movie since ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" ""Also ""Pixars6. Inside Out (2015) An 11-year-old girls brain becomes the backdrop for another hair-raising adventure as her emotions fight to find balance during a rough patch in her life. No shortage of jokes and excitement and early screenings have seen crusty film critics openly weeping in their seats. 7. ""Finding Dory"" (2016) What this follow-up lacks in The Feels it more than makes up for with The Laughs and The Thrills. Ellen DeGeneres returns as the famously forgetful fish who sets off to find the family she forgot she had. Witty bright and exciting even if that tissue in your pocket winds up going unused. 8. The Good Dinosaur (2015) Even though this tale of evolved agrarian dinosaurs unpacks the ever-popular dead-parent plot twist in the first act it offers up both laughs and tears. Frightened awkward dino Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) travels home through a savage landscape with the helpful accompaniment of a feral boy named Spot (Jack Bright) who generally behaves like a dog in a movie where the stakes are slighter but the character bonds are nonetheless rich. 9. Brave (2012) Despite a rough production this saga offers us Merida one of U.S. animations most self-assured characters who refuses to be married off by her father as though she were your run-of-the-mill princess. Meridas skill with a bow and arrow made archery look even more appealing than Jennifer Lawrence does in the ""Hunger Games"" movies. 10. WALL-E (2008) The first half or so of this ecological fable - a silent comedy about the titular robot tidying up an abandoned earth and longing for love - is Pixars greatest achievement. Unfortunately it gets dragged down by a lot of loud chasing in the second half. 11. Ratatouille (2007) Follow your bliss says this entry even if youre a sewer rat who wants to be a gourmet chef. Its lovely and its ending will be forever cited by critics of every medium but some screenwriting contrivances make it good-but-not-great Pixar. ""Also ""Disney Pixar 12. Up (2009) Like ""WALL-E"" this movie opens with a chunk of filmmaking perfection as we get to know the life and losses of our elderly hero. But while theres nowhere for his balloon-festooned house to go but up theres nowhere for the movie to go but down after such an auspicious beginning. 13. Monsters University (2013) This colorful prequel featuring Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) as college freshmen plays like a G-rated ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and thats mostly a good thing. Is this the first kids movie to suggest that higher education isnt necessarily for everyone? 14. Monsters Inc. (2001) The things that go bump in the night are just doing their jobs collecting the screams of boys and girls to power their monstrous alternate dimension. Leave it to Pixar to turn childhood terror into something fuzzy and huggable while also sneaking in a metaphor about over-reliance on fossil fuels. 15. A Bugs Life (1998) Back in 1998 the second Pixar feature was racing to the big screen against the thematically similar ""Antz."" Neither has achieved iconic status notwithstanding the ""Bugs""-themed kiddie area of Disneyland. The film does provide memorable voice roles for ""The Ref"" co-stars Denis Leary (as a manly-man ladybug) and Kevin Spacey (scaring the little ones as an ant-exploiting grasshopper). 16. Cars (2006) Never underestimate little boys and their love for automobiles. This brightly colored but dramatically flat tale is most enjoyed by a) male moviegoers who b) saw it before they turned 10 and c) have no idea that it tells virtually the same story as the Michael J. Fox comedy ""Doc Hollywood."" 17. Cars 2 (2011) ""They should let people see the movie for free"" one pundit opined ""since Disney will make all their money back on the bedsheets."" Some of Pixars best movies are sequels but this follow-up to an already inferior studio entry seemed like nothing but a craven bid for more merchandising money. The results were good for shareholders but middling for moviegoers.

Agreeability gets you so far in life but when the chips are down it helps to lose your temper sometimes. Thats a pretty unexpected moral takeaway for a kids movie and its just one surprise of many in ""The Angry Birds Movie"" a fast fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that at its zenith had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens. Establishing a basic psychological motivation for the fiery disposition shared by the feathered folk of Bird Island this irreverent origin story takes an appropriately loose elastic approach to its larger narrative with frequent detours to fill in daffier details of its mad mad mad mad story world. The result machine-tooled and technically lustrous as it is more or less matches the bouncily anarchic spirit of the game debuted in 2009 by Finnish corporation Rovio Entertainment. While not quite as inspired or subversive as ""The Lego Movie"" its a comparably cheering standout in the generally cynical gallery of product-inspired product -- at every creative level it certainly knocks the fluorescent spots off the harmless-but-charmless ""Ratchet amp; Clank"" video-game adaptation that recently hit theaters. For first-time feature directors Clay Katis and Fergal Reilly both longtime studio animators with major Disney and Warner Bros. credits to their names its an impressive step up to the plate From the reach-out-and-touch-the-screen plushness of the eponymous creatures plumage to the carefully considered 3D design the film is a frequently dazzling feat of craftsmanship saturated in tropical oil-pastel shades. If ""The Angry Birds Movie"" arguably arrives a couple of years past the pop-cultural peak of its source material the finished film justifies Rovios avoidance of a quicker cash-in effort Brightly accessible to viewers who have never so much as tapped the app it could easily found a big-screen franchise of its own. If anything the high-gloss beauty of the production sits slightly at odds with the gleefully scrappy approach of writer Jon Vitti (""The Simpsons"" ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"") whose hell-for-feather screenplay catapult-fires a barrage of stray media references coarse sight gags and deliciously terrible punnery at viewers -- rendering the games simple birds-versus-pigs narrative motor practically incidental. A breakneck pre-credit sequence zips through the lush iridescent foliage of Bird Island a peaceable kingdom of complacently flightless fowl introducing its hapless heavy-browed hero Red (sparkily voiced by Jason Sudeikis) mid-assignment as an inauspiciously cranky childrens entertainer. An ensuing bout of avian rage against his employers lands the aptly colored Red -- already a social outcast in his otherwise jolly community -- in court where hes handed the islands maximum penalty anger management classes with New Age-y therapist Matilda (Maya Rudolph). (She bills herself as a ""free rage chicken""; if that tickles you prepare to guffaw consistently for 97 minutes.) There Red aligns with characters wholl be familiar to viewers of spinoff TV series ""Angry Birds Toons"" hyperactive cock-of-the-walk Chuck (Josh Gad) potentially explosive dim-bulb Bomb (Danny McBride) and menacing inarticulate lummox Terence (given a low steady growl by Sean Penn the wittiest casting pick of the films all-star voice ensemble). Their combined antics consume a fun but somewhat distracted first third. Greater focus and tension arrive with a ship full of visitors from distant Piggy Island Bearing slingshots fruit baskets and a penchant for Blake Shelton music these green-skinned porkers claim to come in peace with only Red unpopularly questioning their goodwill. Experienced ""Angry Birds"" players will know hes right to be wary. More than anything these grunting invaders crave a delicacy that a dyslexic Dr. Seuss might pair with green ham eggs. Though Bird Island is already heavily anthropomorphized -- complete with wood-carved selfies and mother-chick yoga classes -- the mutually marauding antics that ensue pit the pigs as vulgarly humanoid egg-guzzling antagonists to their unspoiled idyll. Theres an environmentalist allegory to be drawn from their showdown not that the filmmakers are overly concerned with such subtext given such a merry array of one-and-done jokes and equally disposable plot asides to charge through. ""The Angry Birds Movie"" knows its about the candy-colored details rather than any bigger picture Viewers may well have forgotten what even happened before the closing-credits diversions -- suitably soundtracked to Demi Lovato sugar-rush cover of ""I Will Survive"" --  are through but the most outlandish gags will stick longest. The best of them all involving a doting mama bird regurgitating food into her childrens lunch boxes at least injects a modicum of biological accuracy into this high-flown fantasy. At least a few worthwhile life lessons however survive this otherwise infectiously inconsequential whirlwind not least its defense of the occasional black mood amid a riot of color ""Why do we have to agree?"" Red pleads with his Stepford-sunny bird brethren. ""Why does it matter that were not all the same?"" Such statements combined with a wry subplot involving gone-to-seed bird leader Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) that warns of the dangers and disappointments of hero-worship make a welcome stand for individual thought and expression -- hardly the first outcome youd expect from a film based on such a hypnotizing gaming phenomenon. Impressionable tykes can do what they will with such messages; some parents should be warned may never eat scrambled eggs again.
