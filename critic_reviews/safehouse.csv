When the house is compromised they team up to make their getaway and hunt down their betrayers. The films super-saturated look and quick cutting are mere substitutes for any real sense of intrigue. Although Washington and Reynolds give good performances between the bloody fights and shoot-outs the movie is derivative and combative in a ""Bourne""-like way (the editor and the cameraman worked on those films). This movies main virtue is its solid supporting cast which includes Sam Shepard and Ruben Blades; they know what to do with a few minutes of quiet screen time.      --Bruce Diones Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

When Frost surrenders to the US Embassy in South Africa Westons bosses back at Langley have no time to ponder his twisted motives. Minutes after Frost is transferred to Westons safe house for interrogation the place is overrun by mercenaries forcing him and his house guest to go on the run. But who should Weston trust sociopath Frost or his superiors?The rest is one long exhausting chase scene with occasional breaks for slightly stilted dialogue taking in the Green Point football stadium the labyrinthine Langa Township shootouts and mind-games by Frost. While director Espinosa hones in on the ambiguous battle between Westons idealism and Frosts cynicism British cinematographer Oliver Wood - who filmed the last two Bourne movies - shoots the hell out of everything.

Movies about covert CIA operatives make their own cliches and in a violent and pointless waste of time and money called Safe House they come in twos like double vision. This movie wouldnt be worth the effort even if it were about something which it isnt. Correction Its about how Denzel Washington is not above trashing his reputation when the salary works even if the movie doesnt. Ryan Reynolds who remains as critic-resistant as he is camera-ready plays Matt Weston a rookie CIA agent in Cape Town assigned to oversee a top-secret safe house where terrorists mercenaries and guys with funny accents who havent shaved since the Berlin Wall collapsed are held for questioning and presumably protected by U.S. law. (In Cape Town? The St. Tropez of South Africa? Where the only people questioned are tourists who lose their room keys?) Anyway thats what it says in a screenplay by David Guggenheim that can be described only as whats left after the dog ate the film-school Screenwriting 101 homework. Anyway after smashing up half of the city with action-flick monotony the preppie freshman spy finds himself under orders from headquarters in Langley Va. to guard a master spy called Tobin Frost (Mr. Washington in high dudgeon and deep doo-doo) who is suspected of betraying his government in heinous ways too vague to explain. Frost was once a great CIA hero who wrote the book on interrogation protocol before he turned rogue. Now everybody is after him. It takes the films entire 1-hour 55-minute running time before you discover what they want him for and why. Meanwhile the safe house is invaded by mass murderers Weston believes to be assassins and he has to flee with his prisoner to save both their lives. Much more confusion lies ahead when the killers turn out to be CIA agents themselves but Im getting one step ahead of a movie that is always one step behind. With Weston trying to make sense of his orders via long-distance cell phones (they get better reception in Cape Town than in East Hampton) and Frost running punching machine-gunning hand-grenading and destroying half the cars trucks buildings and innocent pedestrians on the streets the movie collapses in a noisy farrago of dizzy editing. The woman at The New York Times raved about the sheer beauty of this film which has left me stupefied. There is nothing beautiful in any single frame of the stomach-churning camerawork grainy and shaking around in a series of ugly close-ups. Even the car chases ratcheted up to an ear-splitting decibel level are shot in close-ups robbing the people who like this sort of chaos of the simple pleasure of getting off on the kind of cheap carnage that substitutes for narrative. All of which makes it doubly impossible to figure out what the hell is going on. You can write the plot on the flat side of a bobby pin. Before the CIA can torture Frost into confessing to treason his costar in a dedicated effort to do his job gain seniority and get a raise drags his charge to a locker in a packed soccer stadium where he fires into the crowd and causes a public riot then escapes through a slum maze of collapsible shacks made of corrugated tin. After the CIA big shots (including Sam Shepard Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson in his first film in years in which you can understand his brogue) arrive in South Africa from Langley faster than it takes the red-eye to L.A. they start firing at each other. What is going on here? Suffice it to say that Frost is not the heel Weston thinks he is. Here comes the cliche about secret files proving criminal activity and corruption within the ranks of the CIA. One leak to the press and it could wreck the American peoples blind and unwavering trust in their own government In the end with almost every actor in the cast dead blown to hamburger and six feet under its up to the rookie to save the CIA from a black eye and change the course of history. Are they kidding? Weve seen the CIA vilified as a vipers nest of felons liars and mad-dog killers who all betray each other in dozens of other movies all better and more gripping than Safe House. In fact weve seen scores of other safe-house movies all superior to Safe House. This time the suspect pool is so old its hairy. Directed with a maximum of overrehearsed brutality and a minimum of skill by young Swedish newcomer Daniel Espinosa the movie is so predictable that you figure it out an hour before the actors do. This is a naive director with so little insight you wonder what comic books hes been reading. Under his punishing camera lens everyone looks sallow anemic and terrible including the usually alluring Vera Farmiga who has never looked so haggard. Even GQ coverboy Ryan Reynolds has bags under his eyes as big as walnuts. All of which makes me sad about Denzel Washingtons disillusioning participation. I forgive him if the money was irresistible enough to pay off a mortgage or put his kids through Harvard but Safe House is total junk and he is one of the producers. I guess I respect him too much to call him a junk dealer but when the shoe fits ... rreedobserver.com SAFE HOUSE Running Time 115 minutes Written by David Guggenheim Directed by Daniel Espinosa Starring Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds and Robert Patrick 1/4 Comment Filed under CIA Denzel Washington Double Agent Espionage movie Movie Review Ryan Reynolds Thriller Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2012/02/safe-house-experiences-blowback/,200,safehouse2,safehouse,observer

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Safe House"" is solid evidence of mind-body duality. This overproduced spy thriller never really seized my imagination but it kept my knee jiggling nervously for 115 minutes. Ryan Reynolds plays a junior CIA spook assigned to keep the agencys refuge in Cape Town South Africa ready for action. Its a dead-end job but his Langley-based mentor (Brendan Gleeson) advises him to sit tight Every desirable posting has a mile-long line of more experienced applicants. The dull routine is shattered when a squadron of heavily armed agents arrives at the safe-house door with rogue operative Denzel Washington in custody. Reynolds has his eyes opened to real-world spycraft as he observes Washington undergoing a water-boarding interrogation. Several plot twists later Reynolds and Washington are on the lam trying to outrun enemies who anticipate their every move. Reynolds wants to keep control of his smarter stronger more slippery prisoner. Washington wants to escape and something more that will not astound anyone who has heard of WikiLeaks. Back at CIA headquarters top man Sam Shepard and his aide Vera Farmiga join Gleeson in scowling at big screens scrolling through gigabytes of Really Very Important Highly Top Secret data. All this frowning pacing and fretting at HQ while field agents get painfully wised-up places ""Safe House"" firmly in the ""Bourne"" world of pessimistic espionage. Director Daniel Espinosa has a real gift for grimy-windshield faux realism and bone-rattling action sequences which almost compensates for the boilerplate plot. Espinosa films South Africa in an expressionist palette of hot oranges and livid greens. He brings irresistible momentum to car chases and fight scenes flinging us all over with frantic handheld camera work. Jasin Boland Universal Pictures Ryan Reynolds is shown in a scene from ""Safe House."" Its impossible not to feel sympathetic pain when an agent gets beaten with a shard of glass or suffocated. But while his technique is hyper-stylish Espinosa hasnt mastered the trick of pulling us inside the action connecting us to fully fleshed-out characters. Washingtons performance is a highlights reel combining the stoic heroism of ""Unstoppable"" the antihero ambiguity of ""Inside Job"" and the take-no-prisoners physicality of ""Training Day."" Reynolds holds his customary wise-guy arrogance in check acting pinched with anxiety in every scene. I wont deny that the movie hooked me with sheer brute energy and dragged me along with it most of the way. It left me wrung out and battered but unmoved.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A CIA rookie and a crafty rogue agent are targets in a cat-and-mouse chase. RATING R (violence strong language) BOTTOM LINE A no-nonsense Washington and some crisply directed action give this lightweight spy thriller a little extra punch. CAST Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds Vera Farmiga LENGTH 150 A bantamweight spy thriller ""Safe House"" has just enough bone density to emit some satisfying cracks and pops whenever the action gets going. If you need more than that -- like nuanced characters or sharp dialogue -- then youre in the wrong theater. If not then youre good to go. Ryan Reynolds isnt exactly stretching as rookie CIA agent Matt Weston but he looks far more convincing in a zip-up gray hoodie than in that spandex ""Green Lantern"" suit. What gravitas there is in ""Safe House"" comes from Denzel Washington as Tobin Frost a rogue agent who visits Matts usually empty bunker (hence the films title) for a shorter-than-expected stay. Washingtons Frost has an intelligence thats always simmering whether hes scratching his chin or snapping someones neck. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? First-time screenwriter David Guggenheim a former Us Weekly editor efficiently covers the bases. Its clear that Frost may not be all bad so the film plays hide-the-villain by shuffling around various CIA honchos (serviceably played by Brendan Gleeson Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard). To keep our heroes running theres an ethnically vague assassin named Vargas (Lebanese actor Fares Fares). And Matts pretty girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) is quickly ushered out so the boys can have their fun. ""Safe House"" occasionally takes itself too seriously -- just because Reynolds starts crying over something doesnt mean we will -- but its energetically directed by Daniel Espinosa part of a new Scandinavian wave landing in Hollywood that includes his fellow Swede Tomas Alfredson (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") and Icelands Baltasar Kormakur (""Contraband""). If nothing else its a welcome sign of life during a mostly dull winter at the movies. PLOT A CIA rookie and a crafty rogue agent are targets in a cat-and-mouse chase.

MoviesBiggest movie opening weekends Swedish director doesnt play it Safe When Universal Pictures hired Daniel Espinosa to direct its rogue CIA agent thriller ""Safe House"" the studio knew it was rolling the dice. The Swedish filmmaker had never made an English- language feature hadnt worked with big names such as ""Safe House"" stars Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds and he was graduating from a 4-million Nordic drug drama to an 85-million production. None of that prepared executives for the first batch of footage Espinosa sent back to California from his ""Safe House"" set in South Africa last year. The director was shooting actors through partially closed windows and doors his cameras werent on anyones face for more than an instant and the scenes didnt look as if they could make a coherent narrative.

"Safe House review A tale of two spies |       NJ.com comments Safe House review A tale of two spies Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 10 2012 at 730 AM View/Post Comments UNIVERSALRyan Reynolds left plays a rookie CIA operative and Denzel Washington plays a spy who may or may not be a villain in aSafe House.a Supposedly Matt Weston is a spy for the CIA stationed in South Africa. But in reality hes little more than a glorified housekeeper. His job is to oversee a ""safe house"" a secure off-the-grid installation where other agents -- the real agents -- can hide a friend or brutally interrogate an enemy. Every day Matt turns the key turns on the lights and waits for the doorbell to ring. Then one day it does and all hell breaks loose. And Matt realizes that his safe house isnt very safe at all and now its up to him to protect the infamous prisoner the CIA wanted to interrogate and everyone else on the street wants to kill. The story of someone pushed into a high-stakes job he isnt quite prepared for is a good one and its served a couple of genres. It was particularly useful in ""Three Days of the Condor"" a similar spy story that had desk jockey Robert Redford suddenly fighting off assassins. ""Safe House"" isnt quite as smart as ""Condor"" but that may be as much a function of our sped-up times as it is of the filmmakers. In 1975 audiences would let a movie like ""Condor"" slow down for a quirky ships-that-pass-in-the-night romance and climax with an angry scene of dialogue. Now its all just car chase/gunfight/car chase with barely a pause. That kind of pace can sometimes make a movie feel like more of an endurance test than a drama filled with demolition-derby violence and ear-puncturing gunshots. At least Ryan Reynolds -- who briefly seemed to have a big-star window post-""The Proposal"" before slamming it shut with a couple of flops -- is likable as Matt. You can imagine him as a passed-over government clerk if not the daring young man who joined the Agency. And Denzel Washington is terrific as the ""asset"" an accused traitor whos made nothing but millions -- and enemies -- over the past decade. Seen first in a snap-brim hat and goatee he looks like an exiled jazzman and his softly chuckling confidence makes him a great villain. Or maybe not such a villain -- as other agents begin to come out of the woodwork and like Matt we realize that trust isnt something we should extend lightly. Whatever its flaws the film gives you no chance to get bored. The African locations are fresh and despite a sometimes overly ornate style -- like fast flash-forwards that confuse events more than clarify them -- director Daniel Espinosa keeps things moving along. Keeping the pace going too are energetic performances from some top actors including Sam Shepard Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson as spies who mostly watch all this unfold from a safe distance in D.C. True there are times when were held a bit at a distance too. Despite all the sound and fury we dont get to know our main characters very well or see them do very much besides run shoot and fight. But this is still an exciting energetic ride. And its tricky plot is the illustration of an old lesson learned the moment one royal scribe stole a peek at anothers papyrus Trust no one. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and a brief sexual situation. Safe House (R) Universal (115 min.) Directed by Daniel Espinosa. With Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Jasin Boland) Universal Pictures Sam Shepard in ""Safe House."" Photo by Universal Pictures ""Do I make you nervous?""Thats a renegade assassin named Tobin Frost speaking but it could also be the man who plays him Denzel Washington. Washington is an actor who doesnt mess around and as an ex-CIA agent who betrays his former comrades hes the quietly ticking time bomb at the center of an explosive thriller.A legendary psychological operative until he went rogue Frost has been off the radar for several years when he abruptly surrenders at the U.S. Embassy in Cape Town South Africa. The agency brass (including Sam Shepard Brendan Gleeson and Vera Farmiga) order an interrogation team to waterboard the defector at a safe house manned by rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). Weston is hoping for a promotion so he can marry the French girlfriend who thinks hes an aid worker so he stifles his horror at the brutal means of extracting a confession from the presumed traitor. But the feds arent the only ones targeting Frost and when the smoke clears Weston finds himself on the run with his cunning captive.Fugitive movies are a dime a dozen but ""Safe House"" is in good hands. As the jittery novice crime fighter and the poker-face professional killer Reynolds and Washington have a fire-and-ice chemistry and director Daniel Espinosas shaky-cam technique is an effective expression of the volatility. A shootout at a crowded World Cup soccer match is a particularly vivid use of the South African setting while a horrific fist fight in a kitchen strewn with shattered glass is reminiscent of a scene in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Torn Curtain."" Yet the action is contained within a coherent dramatic structure and the puzzle-box paranoia of spy-agency protocol. While other stars of his generation stoop to self-parody Washington stands tall. We cannot tell a lie Yes he makes us nervous but in a good way.""Safe House""Three and a half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 154  Content Strong violence throughout Videos Watch a trailer for Safe House Feb 9 2012 (...)

Starring Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson Sam Shephard Ruben Blades Nora Arnezeder Robert Patrick Sebastian Roche Tanit Phoenix Director Daniel Espinosa Running time 157 Release Opened Feb 10 2012  Editorial Review The lead flies and the story sinksBy John DeForeFriday Feb. 10 2012As he nears 60 Denzel Washington has begun to carve out a niche as the grumpy or morally compromised foil to young gravitas-seeking white actors. His charisma menaced Ethan Hawke in ""Training Day"" and taunted Chris Pine in ""Unstoppable"" allowing both actors to look more impressive simply by surviving the encounter. Entering ""Safe House"" Ryan Reynolds needs that chance to prove himself. Having failed to earn action-flick credibility with ""Green Lantern"" the actor had yet to show he can become more than a shallow good-timer well tire of after another rom-com or two. If were still unconvinced after ""Safe House"" its largely because the film spends less time on the promising interplay between Reynolds and Washington than on generic spycraft action its makers arent quite up to. As fun as the movie occasionally is it cant make its own drama convincing much less give Reynolds the nudge he needs toward Matt Damon-ville. Reynolds plays Matt Weston a CIA newbie assigned to man a rarely used Cape Town facility. Every day he clocks in checks the supplies and waits to see if hell finally get something to do. And then he does Amid much excitement a squad of tough agents arrives to interrogate Washingtons Tobin Frost a top spy who went rogue nine years ago and has been selling Americas secrets ever since. When the safe house is attacked by baddies bent on killing Frost Weston escapes with him trying to keep his prisoner alive on the streets until a presumably safer new hideout can be arranged by CIA higher-ups. Early on David Guggenheims screenplay proves willing to sacrifice sense for cheap action With Frost out of sight in a car trunk (and his own face unseen by the assassins) Weston could calmly drive out of harms way. Instead he speeds off making himself the target in a car chase weve seen countless times before. Things get dumber before long as Westons faraway bosses expect him to take his wily handcuffed captive into a packed soccer stadium without drawing attention to himself or losing Frost. The scripts climactic double-crosses are easily predicted by any fan of modern-day espionage. But less easily comprehended is the geometry of the movies action sequences. Cinematographer Oliver Wood (who shot the ""Bourne"" films) finds exotic color and texture in his South African settings but Swedish director Daniel Espinosa isnt as adept at chase scenes as ""Bourne"" director Paul Greengrass We sometimes lose track of whos supposed to be where and which direction the bullets are flying. And where ""Bourne"" milked its Langley-based scenes expertly making the most of its time with actors such as Joan Allen ""Safe House"" does too little with turf-hungry spooks played by Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson and assigns chuckle-inducing dialogue to CIA chief Sam Shepard. In the field Frost does get precious moments to play with Westons head but the film doesnt allow Reynolds enough time to move through wide-eyed self-doubt to find the intelligence his character presumably possesses. He takes a pummeling instead. Turns out its easier for filmmakers to show an actor surviving should-be-fatal gut wounds than a battle of wits with Denzel Washington.Contains strong violence and some language.

Photo (c)Universal/courtesy Everett / Ev Safe House"" may strike you as a brilliant movie provided youve seen fewer than say 10 spy thrillers. Ive seen more than 10 spy thrillers. As with ""Three Days of the Condor"" we meet a handsome young spy (actors initials R.R.) from the lowest rung on the CIA ladder. In this case its Ryan Reynolds and his job is housesitter for an empty apartment in Cape Town South Africa. Matt Weston (Reynolds) yearns to do cool spy stuff but instead all hes asked is to be ready with coffee and snacks in case any international supervillains need to be brought there and waterboarded which no one ever does. Until Denzel Washington is Tobin Frost who yields a classic example of how weak screenwriters establish character. For about 20 minutes everyone goes around saying ""Tobin Frost? Really? Youve got Tobin Frost? Hey youre Tobin Frost"" When they waterboard him he jeers telling them their towels are the wrong thread count or something. I was tempted to go out to play a few games of Sudoku as I waited for all the background figures to clear out (Condor ""Everybodys dead"" Weston ""Theyre all dead"") and the movie to settle into the tale of a rookie on the run. Weston regularly calls Langley (as Robert Redford did in ""Condor"") to get a combination of instruction and misdirection that seems equally likely to get him killed or save his life. Irrelevant intel keeps popping up onscreen (""153 p.m. Thursday."" Who cares?) and theres a girl though not an interesting one. Shes French she likes sex and thats about all we get. Even before the scene in which good guy straddles villain and barks ""Who do you work for?"" the movie succeeds extravagantly in its main goal which is to be as average as possible. At CIA HQ where lots of zippy graphics get punched up on screens we meet Matts handler (Brendan Gleeson) another desk officer (Vera Farmiga) and the boss (Sam Shepard). Hes one of those squared-away leaders whose chief skill is yelling that other people should do their jobs. ""I want everything youve got on Tobin Frost"" he o rders. Just once Id like to see a movie spy chief watch in dismay as 40000 pages of documents get forklifted onto his desk. ""Er not everything guys . . . "" These officers tell us (and in a massive open-plan office anyone at the CIA who cares to listen -- isnt this joint supposed to kinda value secrecy?) that Frost is a treasonous spy who ""went off the reservation"" and is pretty much the most-wanted fugitive in the galaxy though Washington plays him in quiet-dignity mode so we know hes actually going to turn out to be a misunderstood hero. The main attraction of the movie is watching Washington school Reynolds -- not in spycraft but in acting. Reynolds is sweaty and frantic. Washington learned long ago that the trick is not to act but to be. He rarely raises his voice above a whisper as the untested Matt (with his fancy Yale economics degree) drives around dodging bullets to find another safe house in which to stash him. Every 10 minutes little-known director Daniel Espinosa throws in rattly ""Bourne Identity"" fight scenes in which whoever is adjacent to Washington gets shot in the face and cars going 50 mph crash without seriously injuring anyone inside. Reynolds incurs the requisite small cut on the left cheek that movie tough guys seem to be born with. The great thing about writing a spy movie is you can make up your own slang (as John le Carre so cleverly did). The CIA is not going to hold a press conference to correct you. Instead screenwriter David Guggenheim picks out every weed in the dialogue garden and presents them as a bouquet ""I want eyes on this"" ""Stay off the grid"" ""Youre good to go"" ""We are completely buttoned up."" Matt the alleged young genius (remember -- he went to Yale) takes Frost to a soccer game with about 80000 people. Because when youre with the most-wanted man in a town crawling with assassins why not parade him around? Get him up on the Jumbotron maybe. The climax of the movie (also familiar from ""Condor"") involves a senior figure doing something even stupider than this. Thanks to Washingtons ease (taking pity on Matt Frost tells him in one of the few sharp lines ""I only hit professionals"") and sufficient noisy gunplay and chases to at least earn the movie the label of ""action-y"" you will want to stick around and learn the identity of the mole who set everything in motion not that this info makes much difference. The ending idiotic as it is is also worth seeing mainly because the subtext reveals so much about Hollywoods upside-down thinking. Yes this is a community that actually considers Julian Assange a hero.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 10 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 09 2012 251PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Its hardly classified information that whenever the words ""CIA agent"" are mentioned in a movie the modifier ""rogue"" will be in close proximity. Such is the case of Safe House a movie with a double-crossing intelligence plot thats so generic its an irritating intrusion in a lively chase through the streets and shantytowns of Cape Town South Africa. Ryan Reynolds stars as a bored junior CIA agent Matt Weston in charge of an unused Cape Town safe house and hoping to be transferred to Paris with his pretty doctor girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder). One day a chance at glory falls into his lap. A former legendary CIA agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) believed to have become a turncoat a decade ago shows up at the U.S. embassy seeking asylum. He ends up in Matts care until a team of other CIA agents arrives takes charge and promptly begins water-boarding the fugitive. ""Is this legal?"" asks Matt which perhaps goes too far in establishing his political naivete. While the ""interrogation"" is going on another team attacks the house and kills the CIA agents except for Weston who escapes with Tobin in a car. Over the next couple of days they race shoot and engage in impressively vicious hand-to-hand battles with their pursuers. Produced by Washington the film is directed by Swedish director Daniel Espinosa in a fragmented speedy style thats a lesser version of the stars favourite director Tony Scott. Cinematographer Oliver Wood who shot the first two Bourne films uses hand-held cameras and lots of zooms along with a desaturated colour palette. The movie flies by in flurried sequences that cling to the edges of coherence. The momentum falters sharply whenever the film cuts to CIA headquarters in Langley Va. where CIA brass are played by a trio of underemployed stars (Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson and top chief Sam Shepard) who bark out orders to underlings while convenient computer screens pop up to provide exposition. We know almost immediately that at least one of the three is a double-crosser desperate to take out Frost before the agent reveals damaging information. But since we know nothing about the characters beyond their suits and hairdos its immaterial who the traitor is. During occasional breathers from the racing punching and shooting Tobin schools Matt in the cynicism of their trade and reveals that he is carrying a file of information that a lot of people would kill for. The relationship between the jaded pro and the idealistic younger man has obvious resonances of Training Day (2001) with Washington a bit too familiar as the ingratiating sinister arch- manipulator. By contrast Reynoldss understated performance as a man deeply over his head is refreshing if not entirely credible. Surely no one who has watched any espionage movie of the past decade could be quite so naive.

Chris Vognar Follow chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Culture Published 09 February 2012 0515 PM Updated 11 February 2012 0949 AM Somewhere in Hollywood must sit a pile of scripts about rogue government agents. Every couple of months or so an executive reaches in and churns one into development. How else to explain the steady deluge?The latest selection is Safe House and its pretty good. Denzel Washington is the CIA agent who may or may not have sound reasons for causing mayhem in South Africa and betraying his country.His Tobin Frost is a Denzel Special calm swaggering and lethal. In short a bad dude. Wearing a thick do and a scraggly beard Washington has quiet fun underplaying the parts moral ambiguity and makes it hard to turn away even when the story goes through long stretches of spinning its wheels.Ryan Reynolds plays Washingtons fretful novice counterpart a duty filled by Ethan Hawke in Training Day. Reynolds junior caseworker is minding a Capetown safe house where Tobin is interrogated (and waterboarded) when assassins break in and create a blood bath. Escaping with his charge he and we are left to wonder who so desperately wants Tobin dead.Cinematographer Oliver Wood and editor Richard Pearson have both worked with Paul Greengrass and Safe House directed by Daniel Espinosa has the frantic chopped-up visual-action pacing of Greengrass Bourne movies. The colors are rich and saturated -- the deep reds of shanty roofs and blues of a Metro station -- and some of the compositions are quite striking. Safe House is a good-looking genre movie though the many hand-to-hand combat sequences can get a bit scrambled.The senior agents back in Langley are played by capable supporting players including Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard (I kept expecting him to start writing a play every time he opened a file). The back-and-forth between the home office and the guys in the field feels rote and tired mostly because its been done so many times before. But Washington keeps the core interesting enough to stay onboard and Reynolds provides strong help.This kind of movie needs movie stars and its fortunate to have one that can elevate pretty standard material.SAFE HOUSEB Directed by Daniel Espinosa.

Photo Jasin Boland Universal Pictures Safe House review Spectacle plays it too safe 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Safe House Action drama. Starring Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard. Directed by Daniel Espinosa. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Safe House"" is an idea for a movie. Its a few blustery gestures in the direction of a story with five good actors doing their best trying to hold up the barest frame of an idea while investing the surrounding emptiness with all the truth they can muster. Get past the annoyance and put cotton in your ears and you may realize what youre really witnessing here. Not a noisy mess. Not an action blockbuster but a sad and pitiful spectacle. So we have Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington. Sounds good so far. Reynolds is a low-level CIA operative running a safe house in Cape Town South Africa not exactly a glamour assignment. But he has ambitions. Like everybody he wants to be reassigned to Paris and so he has reason to toe the line and be a good soldier. And Washington? He plays one of those movie creations an impossibly cool international man of mystery a former CIA man who went rogue and started selling secrets to Americas enemies. He is the baddest toughest man on the planet. Fine. So far still good. One day this bad man shows up at a U.S. Embassy in South Africa and surrenders himself to American authorities. He wants to go back to the United States. Why? Maybe he is bad but not evil. Maybe he has information that people should know and that the CIA would rather keep secret. So the bushy young CIA agent gets what should be a simple assignment to hold the rogue agent in a safe house until his superiors can pick him up and transport him to the United States. But of course there are powerful people who dont want this man to tell his story and so right there thats the movie A young inexperienced agent finds himself protecting the worlds most dangerous fellow while everyone is coming out of the woodwork with machine guns trying to kill them both. Still that might have been something right? The commercials that aired during the Super Bowl made ""Safe House"" look like another ""Training Day"" with Washington climbing into the head of yet another fresh-faced young man with everything to lose. With Washington and Reynolds together thats all the audience wants isnt it? Tense mind-bending encounters between the two actors set against enough action to keep the movie going. But thats not what we get. The story remains vague a sketch anyone might write on the back of a cocktail napkin. Were told within 15 minutes that there is a traitor who fears exposure working inside the CIA and any viewer who has seen more than one movie will identify the traitor instantly. There are no twists no turns no changes and no nuances to the plot which remains about one thing and one thing only A lot of guys are trying to kill two other guys. Washington and Reynolds dont get to act together. They get to run together duck together ride in a car together and share a shaky frame together. They have only one strong scene in which Washington gets to do some real acting but beyond that theres nothing - for 115 minutes. Its just long long action sequences without suspense interspersed with scenes back at Langley in which Brendan Gleeson Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard as CIA honchos have conversations and more or less explain the plot to us. Its a waste of everyones talent except maybe that of the screenwriter (David Guggenheim) and the director (Daniel Espinosa). But no lets give them the benefit of the doubt too.

The scenes of fighting shooting and car-chasing are all quite breathtaking but youll be twitching for the fast-forward button during the seemingly endless sequences of plot development and dialogue that connect all the thrilling stuff together. CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) hopes for a more exciting assignment after 12 months of minding the agencys Cape Town South Africa safe house a gig that mostly involves sitting by the phone and making sure the fridge is stocked with drinks and plasma. His introduction to the world of spy action comes when rogue agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) comes in from the cold at the American consulate in Cape Town after a decade of being off the grid and engaging in nefarious business. While Frost is being waterboarded (unsuccessfully -- hes played by Denzel Washington after all) at the safe house armed gunmen invade the place and take out everyone but Weston and Frost who escape together and prompt a hair-raising high-speed car chase which culminates with the two agents trying to kill each other in a car thats ripping through traffic pedal to the metal. ""Safe House"" lives up to its title by going exactly where you can expect from here -- Weston is accused of aiding and abetting Frosts escape Frost may not be the villain everyone thinks theres treachery among the CIAs top tier and so on forever and ever amen. When Swedish director Daniel Espinosa making his U.S. debut gets to put his lead characters into dangerous situations involving Range Rovers automatic weapons or even hand-to-hand combat ""Safe House"" suddenly gets a pulse. But then things slow down and were stuck with David Guggenheims tin-eared unengaging screenplay. When I see Vera Farmiga in a thankless role like the one she has here -- as an exposition-spouting CIA functionary -- the one upside is the thought that shes raising money to make the follow-up to her extraordinary 2011 directorial debut ""Higher Ground."" If nothing else ""Safe House"" is the kind of movie giving work to a gaggle of talented character actors -- including Sam Shepard Brendan Gleeson Ruben Blades Robert Patrick and Tracie Thoms (""Death Proof"") -- who barely have to break a sweat in exchange for a paycheck that will cover some experimental theater or earning scale in an indie. As for the stars the results are like watching an Olympic swimmer make his way through a gigantic bowl of oatmeal. Reynolds mopes about (worried about his characters girlfriend safety and guilty for having lied to her about what he does for a living) while Washington -- whose character is supposed to be a genius at manipulating people even though we almost never see him do it -- takes on an air of mild concern with traces of regret and basically plays that note over and over from start to finish. Its yet another movie that doesnt play to Reynolds strengths as a performer and another one in which Washington coasts on our collective memory of his best work. Still as action porn goes the money shots are definitely worth it. Just sneak out for popcorn whenever the conversations start. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

But when the safe house is attacked he finds himself on the run with his charge. Video courtesy of NBC Universal. By John Anderson February 10 2012 ""Do I make you nervous?"" asks renegade CIA agent Tobin Frost eyeballing the equally treacherous British operative sitting beside him in Cape Town South Africa traffic. ""Always"" replies the Brit as a snipers bullet ventilates his skull. Clearly theres something dangerous about hanging out with Tobin Frost. The same can be said of Denzel Washington who brings his cobra smile and a surfeit of charisma to Swedish director Daniel Espinosas often frenetic action thriller ""Safe House."" Co-starring the ubiquitous Ryan Reynolds the film works well or not according to who is on screen As Tobins outmatched opponent CIA ""housekeeper"" Matt Weston (he maintains the agencys safe house in Cape Town) Mr. Reynolds brings an appropriate degree of naivete and boyishness to a film thats largely about loss of innocence. But whether hes right for the role or not is irrelevant What we want to watch is Mr. Washington and of him there is not nearly enough. ENLARGE Denzel Washington in Safe House. Universal Studios Its curious given Mr. Espinosas often furious style and indulgence in artistic mayhem how much of ""Safe House"" neatly fits into predetermined slots. As Hollywoods go-to callow youth Mr. Reynolds is a casting directors no-brainer Matt is angling for a post in Paris where he would be much nearer his girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) and could get his stalled career in gear. Ideology? Absent. Similarly by the book is the casting of his three superiors Sam Shepard shows up these days whenever anyone needs a gray eminence; Brendan Gleeson is a slippery character something a spy movie certainly needs; and Vera Farmiga is filmdoms ripe actress of the moment with the looks intelligence and just enough years to make her plausible as a high-ranking CIA officer. The wild card is Mr. Washington. Even though hes too attractive and engaging to be a natural villain you cant say he doesnt try He won an Oscar for playing the bad guy in ""Training Day."" He was charmingly sinister in ""American Gangster."" He even went out of his way to be unlikable in ""Unstoppable."" In ""Safe House"" hes a near-mythical rogue agent who has sold out the CIA time and again to the highest bidder. Spoken about in hushed tones he seems to be Langleys version of Voldemort although when he appears in Cape Town clad in a wide-brimmed hat and sweeping black coat--a cloak-and-dagger affectation thats both marvelous and marvelously overdone--his intentions are unclear. He is shown injecting something into his side which later turns out to be a tiny capsule containing information valuable enough that every mercenary and Mossad agent in town is after him. The heat becomes so intense that Tobin turns himself in to the U.S. embassy. Better that than sure death on the street. Perhaps hell be handed over to someone inept enough to let him get away? Enter Matt who cant understand why he hasnt been given bigger things to do. (Its clear enough to us.) A band of CIA agents arrives at the safe house and immediately subjects Tobin to water torture. ""Is this legal?"" Matt asks worriedly--a line which in terms of character development and economy is near perfect absolving him from adult responsibility and affirming the agencys good judgment. When the CIA officers are swiftly blown away by an invading army of opposing agents Matt is left holding the bag i.e. Tobin and we brace ourselves for a mismatch. The fact is were already in one. ""Safe House"" is a sturdy enough thriller but one that consistently defaults to the less interesting of its two lead characters. The ads for the movie imply that Tobin is some kind of Hannibal Lecter and Matt his Clarisse but theres only a hint of that. Much more time is devoted to Matt keeping Tobin in check or chasing after him once he flees taking Mr. Espinosas better instincts with him The psychological nuance of ""Safe House"" which seemed so promising gets subsumed by action which is ambitious but less bracing than what Mr. Washington seemed to be cooking up behind that smile. Set in 1999 Los Angeles veteran police officer Dave Brown the last of the renegade cops works to take care of his family and struggles for his own survival. Video courtesy of Millennium Entertainment. Rampart ""Im not a racist"" says Dave Brown. ""I hate all people equally."" You believe half of what he says and as inhabited by Woody Harrelson all of what he is A misanthropic street cop in 1999 Los Angeles who is smoking drinking and not-eating himself to death brutalizing suspects and thanks to others just like him watching the sun set on his special brand of community policing. ENLARGE Woody Harrelson in Rampart. Millenium Entertainment They say westerns are out but writer-director Oren Moverman has made one in the tradition of ""Shane"" ""The Gunfighter"" and ""Lonely Are the Brave"" stories about men who see the writing on the wall but refuse to heed it. With Mr. Harrelson Mr. Moverman has created an antihero of epic proportions and indiscretions. Nicknamed ""Date Rape"" for having avoided prosecution for the murder of a serial rapist Dave lives next door to his two ex-wives who happen to be sisters (Cynthia Nixon Anne Heche) and whose daughters are both sisters and cousins (Brie Larson Sammy Boyarsky). Having failed the bar exam for an unspecified but probably perverse reason Dave can thrust and parry with any bureaucrat the city throws at him (Sigourney Weaver Steve Buscemi). They cant touch him. To get Dave theyd have to capture him on video beating a black motorist with a blackjack. Which is precisely what happens. The grossly underrated Mr. Harrelson looks menacingly gaunt throughout and recaptures the intensity he brought to Mr. Movermans ""The Messenger."" Framing Dave against the azure Los Angeles sky or a taco joint the Israeli-born director puts a fresh spin on Old West-style rugged individualism and it isnt pretty. But like Daves blackjack it earns our attention. Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Sean Anderson partners with his moms boyfriend on a mission to find his grandfather who is thought to be missing on a mythical island. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. A mash-up of Jules Verne Jonathan Swift Robert Louis Stevenson and the Lost Continent of Atlantis ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" is the kind of movie in which the teenage boy is disgruntled the teenage girl wears a tank top the island locale rings with reggae music regardless of its proximity to Jamaica and any action sequence is rendered in painfully deliberate slo-mo. And its all in 3-D of course even if the effects get shoehorned into the narrative In one sequence Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has to toss tropical berries at the chest of stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) whose overdeveloped pecs propel those berries through the fourth wall. Its simply delicious. As the lad pursues the plucky Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and her father (Luiz Guzman) dithers shamelessly Sean and Hank are escorted by Seans grandfather (Michael Caine who it seems never turns down a role) across the fabled Atlantis where sharks are the size of goldfish and our heroes ride bareback on bumblebees. Its not as magical as it sounds. Far more enchanting is ""Daffys Rhapsody"" the new Daffy Duck-Elmer Fudd cartoon playing before ""Journey 2."" Reminiscent of the classic ""Whats Opera Doc?"" it features Daffy in a one-duck show about his life which he sings (to Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody) as Elmer tries to shoot him. Its a neat marriage of old and new The technology is 3-D; the voice is that man of a thousand voices Mel Blanc who died in 1989 but recorded this in the 1950s. In Darkness A dramatization of one mans rescue of Jewish refugees in the Nazi-occupied Polish city of Lvov. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. In her gripping Holocaust drama ""In Darkness"" celebrated Polish director Agnieszka Holland portrays a world in which the Nazis exist outside of any moral equation. Their acts of cruelty are routine their souls irredeemable their existence irrelevant to a story involving questions of human emotion. The point is that ""In Darkness"" a fact-based story about Jews hiding underground in occupied Poland is not a film about good and evil. Its about good and good--which like Ms. Hollands occasional shot of a Jewish child playing with a rat in a sewer can be more horrifying than a bomb blowing up a building. In 1943 Lvov as the Nazi crackdown begins Leopold (Robert Wieckiewicz) a sewer worker who routinely robs houses vacated by the dead and deported agrees to hide a group of Jews but only because they can pay him. Wanda (Kinga Preis) Leopolds wife and a devout Catholic refuses to go along with her neighbors opportunistic anti-Semiticism. Leopold therefore must keep his profitmaking even from her as he tries to keep himself and ""his Jews"" from being discovered and executed. ENLARGE Krzysztof Skonieczny and Robert Wieckiewicz in In Darkness. Sony Pictures Classics The film has an almost relentless dramatic tension something intensified by Jolanta Dylewskas cinematography which gives a greasy texture to the sewer and the increasingly sallow flesh of its inhabitants. What makes this nominee for the best-foreign-film Oscar singular among Holocaust movies is the way it characterizes the banality of life underground People may be hip-deep in water and peril but theyre still practicing all their surface vices--bickering battling having adulterous sex taking drugs practicing snobbery even as the jackboots echo overhead. There are several set pieces that are remarkable technically and cinematically but what lingers after the lights come on is a kind of brutal beauty very sad and very human. --Mr. Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE Training Day (2001) Denzel Washington won his second Oscar (the first was for ""Glory"") for playing a thoroughly corrupt cop in this Antoine Fuqua-directed suspense thriller. One could argue Mr. Washington was really the supporting player to Ethan Hawke Its Hawkes Jake Hoyt after all who develops and changes as hes introduced to the realities of street policing by Mr. Washingtons Alonzo Harris who remains throughout the film one profoundly bad dude. The role made Mr. Washington the first African-American Best Actor Oscar winner in almost 40 years Sidney Poitier having received the award for ""Lilies of the Field"" in 1963. L.A. Confidential (1997) The LAPD of director Curtis Hansons daylighted noir (with spectacularly subtle cinematography by Dante Spinotti) is a big big barrel of bad apples in this adaptation of the James Ellroy novel scripted by Mr. Hanson and Brian Helgeland (""Mystic River""). Its a movie in which everything seems to coalesce including the careers of its three principals--Russell Crowe Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey--each of whom plays a cop confronting his own brand of corruption. The only performer in the film to get an Oscar though was Kim Basinger for playing Veronica Lake-lookalike Lynn Bracken. The Departed (2006) The Academy Award winner for Best Picture of 2006 Martin Scorseses Irish mob movie earned an Academy nomination for Mark Wahlberg who portrayed a rotten human being. The rotten cop on the other hand was played by Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan who infiltrates the Massachusetts State Police at the same time good guy Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is infiltrating Bostons top gang of cutthroats. Said cutthroats are headed up by a particularly evil Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello who was modeled after noted Beantown bad guy Whitey Bulger who at the time was sunning himself in Santa Monica. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The directors frequent collaborations with Denzel Washington are guilty-pleasure entertainments -- particularly the dark exploitation-lite of 2004s Man on Fire -- but theyre mostly built on a familiar template. Washingtons always playing a cool-under-pressure character whos asked to go above and beyond with life and death on the line and the cameras always following the action with grainy photography and claustrophobically jittery close-ups. Its not a difficult manual to decipher -- and with Safe House Swedish director Daniel Espinosa follows the Scott-Washington playbook with a tedious fidelity. As in Man on Fire Washington plays a former CIA operative whos long since left the agency. But instead of the bitter drunk of that film Safe Houses Tobin Frost is a man still in top form both physically and in his ability to psychologically manipulate those around him. Espinosa puts his skills on display in a lengthy opening action sequence in which he is pursued around Cape Town South Africa by a team of mercenaries. Frost whos been making his living off the grid as a spy-for-hire since going AWOL from the CIA has just scored a trove of documents detailing intelligence secrets and government scandals from around the world when the chase begins; the director choreographs the sequence to neatly introduce Frosts skills then caps it by quite literally introducing the character He ducks into the American consulate announcing that ""My name is Tobin Frost."" The CIA pulls him out of the consulate taking him for questioning to a safe house watched over by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) a young field agent paying his dues in this dull assignment and hoping for bigger and better things. The opportunity to prove his mettle arrives with the extraction team and their fugitive who has been brought here for some ""enhanced interrogation."" Hes so cool under pressure (Frosty get it?) that he lectures the team on the insufficient thread count of the towels theyre about to use to waterboard him. Weston acting as audience proxy is appropriately horrified at the torture hes witnessing but its cut short when the safe house turns out to be not so safe. He and Frost escape and head out on the lam together. Inexperienced field agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) prepares to fend off an attack on his CIA safe house in Cape Town South Africa. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Espinosa is perfectly capable and the action packs plenty of excitement even if the direction lacks the visual innovation that might provide unexpected jolts. Washington and Reynolds are excellent together in much the same vein as Washington and Ethan Hawke in Training Day or Washington and Chris Pine in Unstoppable (the latter another Scott-Washington picture). Sensing the pattern? Hes done the wise mentor to the hot-headed but ambitious youth thing before but Washingtons magnetic intensity and unassailably cool air have always set him apart from most other action stars and hes as impossible to dislike here as ever. Reynolds meanwhile makes this one of those periodic performances that reminds us hes capable of being an excellent actor; if only hed quit making such awful role choices. But their performances cant save Safe House from its boilerplate-thriller bones. Theres plenty of inexplicably poor decision-making on the part of the characters just to move the plot forward. And the worst is writer David Guggenheims insistence on a cheap bait-and-switch so blatantly obvious that the second half of the film becomes a tedious wait for a plot twist everyone will have seen coming half an hour out. In telegraphing every move and by painting so rigorously by the numbers the film takes no risks at all. Which I suppose makes Safe House true to its title -- but safety doesnt exactly put the thrills in a thriller.

But it occasionally stumbles by putting Washington too frequently in observer mode. Sometimes he provides a much-needed sense of calm but in other scenes hes confined to the sidelines while Reynolds character focuses on a dull romance with a French medical student (Nora Arnezeder).Reynolds plays Matt Weston a low-level CIA ""housekeeper"" in Cape Town South Africa in charge of a safe house where suspects are taken by CIA operatives to be interrogated and sometimes tortured to induce them to talk.BLOG Denzel Washington waterboarded while filmingVIDEO Safe House NYC PremiereWashington is Tobin Frost the agencys most notorious traitor. His superb performance suggests deep reserves of knowledge and his character comes off as world-weary and wry. Its as if he embodies the Elvis Costello line ""I used to be disgusted and now I try to be amused.""As the idealistic Weston Reynolds is pitch-perfect. He goes from bored rookie to an anxious guy in way over his head and trying desperately to keep up. He even gets roughed up believably as his handsome features get scratched up and are overtaken by beady-eyed wariness.About the movieSafe House1/2 out of fourStars Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds Brendan Gleeson Vera Farmiga Sam Shepard Ruben Blades DirectorDaniel EspinosaDistributor Universal Pictures Rating R for strong violence throughout and some language Running time 1 hour and 55 minutes Opens today nationwideTheir paths cross when Frost turns up in Cape Town after years of eluding authorities. Within the first minutes we see him cleverly conceal an all-important computer file mysteriously avoid a sharpshooters bullet and escape from a horde of nimble assassins. Then he mystifies everyone by turning himself in at the U.S. Embassy.From there Frost is brought to the house managed by Weston. Shortly thereafter the house comes under siege and the only two who survive are Frost and Weston.Determined and principled but untested Weston whisks Frost off determined to turn him over to CIA brass. High-adrenaline chases ensue as do double- and triple-crossing. Frost is an expert manipulator but Weston an ambitious Yale grad does his best to remain in charge. Their story becomes one of mentor and protege as the trust-no-one atmosphere crescendos.Director Daniel Espinosa seems to have borrowed a page from the book of Bourne franchise director Paul Greengrass. But where those thrillers are consistently suspenseful with taut intricate plots Safe Houses weakest point is structural. It builds up to an anticlimactic resolution that should be more politically complex. Still Espinosa directs with flair particularly during a chase that involves Washington jumping across shanty roofs dodging bullets.Its a familiar tale of conspiracy and corruption at nearly every level as well as idealism shattered. But told as it is with energy and verve Safe House is a bracing action thriller made all the more watchable because of its two lead performances.

In this efficient spy chase film the star plays a CIA rogue who messes with Ryan Reynolds pretty mind By Richard Corliss Feb. 09 2012 Share Read Later Universal PicturesRyan Reynolds and Denzel Washington Safe House Year 2012 Director Daniel Espinosa Studio Universal Actors Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds RelatedSafe House a bumpy ride with Denzel in the drivers seat Chicago TribuneSafe House Denzel is a fun break from walls of familiarity The Seattle Times Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Just about every government in the world wants Tobin Frost dead. A top CIA operative who went rogue a decade ago Frost has been an embarrassment to the agency higher-ups who cant stop or find him. So they are pleased and a little edgy when Frost running for his life from some ruthless nameless commando force surrenders at the U.S. Embassy in Cape Town South Africa. Taken to a safe house he is subjected to a brisk waterboarding by the local CIA chief; apparently our authorities still thinks the technique works. A moment later the commando squad breaks into this very pregnable fortress and kills everyone not billed above the title the rogue warrior Frost and the low-level keeper of the safe house Matt Weston. Now the bear and the fawn are on their own. Expect Frost to mess with Matts mind as Hannibal Lecter did with Clarice Starlings. Theres one important wrinkle in Daniel Espinosas just-above-routine spy thriller Safe House Frost is played by Denzel Washington. Can the actor impart satanic humor to a standard bad-genius role which would be catnip for other Hollywood stars in their mid-50s like John Travolta and Bruce Willis? Not hardly. Washington since he turned to action roles in mid-career has been the pure or scarred hero often enigmatic but rarely villainous. A Safe House colleague refers to Frost as ""the black Dorian Gray"" and Washington at 57 looks fit and fine. But its the quiet grandeur the imperious glower that set him apart. Almost uniquely among contemporary actors he doesnt show his sunny side. The characters he plays think life is no joke. Like Thomas Hobbes they find it ""solitary poor nasty brutish and short."" (MORE See Mary Pols review of Washington in Unstoppable) That sullen majesty has made Washington according to an annual Harris poll the only actor chosen as one of the top three of favorite movie stars over the past six years. This year he was tied for second with Clint Eastwood just behind Johnny Depp. (The Harris voters like their stars mature John Wayne dead since 1979 finished fifth this year.) Washington was also the No. 1 star among pollees who identified themselves as Democrats. They might be wishing that Barack Obama had some of Washingtons grit and vinegar. Matt Frosts reluctant protector in Safe House is played by Ryan Reynolds whose granite abs deserve their own security team. (Not wanting to disappoint his fans Reynolds goes topless in the first few minutes.) In David Guggenheims script Matt chafes at his menial CIA job as the safe-house landlord and express his frustration by frequently hurting furniture. But at heart Reynolds is a bland Canadian a dishier Brendan Fraser. Frost quickly spots Matts callow vulnerability holding a gun to the young mans head he refuses to finish him off saying ""I only kill professionals."" (Ouch Matt must think shoot me but dont castrate me.) For the rest of the movie which puts both men on the run from their assassins Matt will sweat to prove hes Frosts kind of man. Washingtons go-to director for action movies is Tony Scott (Crimson Tide Man on Fire Deja Vu The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 and Unstoppable) with a stopover for Scotts older brother Ridley (American Gangster). But he also had good luck with the Hughes brothers two winters ago in The Book of Eli. Here he taps Espinosa a Swede whose 2010 drug-crime drama Easy Money revealed a ready-for-Hollywood flashiness. (MORE See Corlisss review of The Book of Eli) Espinosa directs Safe House very much in the Paul Greengrass action-film style. Like Greengrasss Jason Bourne movies (Supremacy and Ultimatum) Espinosas film has several cramped-space fights plenty of birds-eye point-of-view shots and a chic garish color scheme. Same cinematographer too Oliver Wood but less of Greengrasss obsessive shaky-cam -- thank you Espinosa also tweaks a chase-scene cliche the one that sends a dozen tough guys tromping over the tin roofs of a far-flung urban slum (cf. Fast Five). This time one of the chasers falls through to the living area below. Sometimes its a tonic when a fantasy caper provides a dash of reality (and gravity). Safe House plows through its familiar twists with efficient brio and a distinguished supporting cast (Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson Sam Shepard Ruben Blades Robert Patrick). Its a decent February movie that smartly extends Washingtons God-on-the-run character. But and this hardly merits a SPOILER ALERT the film hews steadfastly to the core credo of spy movies that the CIA brass are remorseless smarties at the core of every international misdeed. (If theyre such brilliant scoundrels why couldnt they predict the fall of the Soviet Union or 9/11? Or did they know but -- maniacal laugh -- didnt tell?) Politics aside we hope a screenwriter will dare to consider the ultimate spy-movie twist making the CIA top dogs heroes instead of fops and sociopaths.

More about Safe House >> Calm-and-collected in clandestine meetings savoring glasses of fine wine eluding squads of sinister goons escaping Houdini-like from one bad fix to the next he hardly looks ruffled barely quickens his step. Long ago he was a top op. He was the case officer who ""rewrote agency interrogation protocols"" (someone says impressed). Inside Langley he was legendary. Outside Langley he moved like a ghost. And now hes the ""house guest"" in a secret holding facility somewhere in downtown Cape Town. An eager inexperienced agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is playing host - idly throwing tennis balls against the wall when he gets an urgent phone call to expect company. And then comes Frost in handcuffs a bag over his head ringed by a CIA extraction team and accused of being a traitor to his country. And then come those sinister goons battling their way into the building. And there go Frost and Weston on the run. Written by David Guggenheim a former US Weekly staffer and directed by Daniel Espinosa a filmmaker whose fast furious Swedish crime drama Snabba Cash won him heaps of attention Safe House rockets along taking a familiar formula and making it work - hard. Sure weve seen the seasoned pro/rookie protege thing before (in fact weve seen it in Training Day which earned Washington his Oscar playing a cynical LAPD veteran opposite Ethan Hawkes idealistic newbie). But both Frost and Weston have backstories and Washington and Reynolds invest their respective characters with pathologies that seem genuine. And Washington just has a way of watching - working his eyes across a room or across another mans face - that suggests canny instincts a been-there/done-that savvy. There are some accomplished quick-cut white-knuckle chase sequences in Safe House by foot by car by leaps across the tin roofs of Langa a shantytown on the outskirts of the beautiful coastal city. Espinosa and his team have watched their Bourne movies they know their stuff deliver the jolts. Alas like the Bourne movies there are cutaways to the situation room at HQ where in this case a worried Vera Farmiga stands barking commands into the speaker phone. (Essentially the same thing she did in last years Source Code.) And there are shots of Brendan Gleeson on his cell on a D.C. sidewalk talking Weston through his travails. Sam Shepard is a CIA deputy director Ruben Blades a wily counterfeiter and old pal of Frosts Liam Cunningham is an MI6 compadre Robert Patrick a tough CIA team leader and Joel Kinnaman (from The Killing) a fellow agency housekeeper. Nora Arnezeder is the French girlfriend Weston is all torn up about and its not hard to see why. Inevitably Safe House falls back on transparent genre conventions but at least it does so with a knowing wink. When Frost tells Weston how things are going to play out - the two of them holed up in a hotel hiding out from guys with guns - he predicts that the CIA bosses are going to say ""Youve done a fine job. Well take it from here."" And wouldnt you know it thats exactly what Reynolds Weston eventually hears. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

It takes only one shot to understand how Denzel Washingtons feeling in ""Safe House. He plays Tobin Frost one of those misunderstood CIA operatives whos ""gone rogue whos ""off the reservation - you can really tell because for about an hour his hair and goatee are beginning to go all Cornel West. For reasons this movie tries but fails to make clear Tobin is a) named Tobin b) extremely wanted for double-agenting and c) in possession of information that would seem to exonerate his defection but that he needs an entire 115-minute action-thriller to bring to light.After a tense early sequence Tobin turns himself in at Cape Towns American consulate (South Africa is the hot new place to film cheaply) and is dragged to an interrogation room inside one of the CIAs so-called safe houses. He knows hes about to be waterboarded but hes unfazed. Thats when we get a shot of Tobin seated with his legs crossed and his cuffed hands calmly folded as though hes waiting for a girlfriend to finish in a department-store fitting room. Its a comical shot insofar as its supremely Denzel.Here is a star in such complete command of his cool that he cant even be bothered to look a little nervous about the prospect of torture. Frost sounds like just the right name for a man who barely winces in a crashed car and who never seems out of breath even after a foot chase across the tin roofs of a shanty township (yes ""Safe House is that movie too).Because hes being hunted by a gang of heavily armed extremely incompetent local thugs who want what he has Tobin must be whisked away to a safer house by Matt Weston an under-ripe field agent played by Ryan Reynolds. Matts determined to bring Tobin in. Tobin refuses to go without first instigating a half-dozen action sequences. At some point the laughless hate-love relationship between these two makes you long for the wit in the script of ""Midnight Run or the chemistry of ambivalence that passes there between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.At CIA headquarters in Langley Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard intensify the dragginess through no fault of their own. Everything they do and say is procedural control-room talk. Theres more drama on C-SPAN although Farmigas blouses emit a robust authority best described as ""high Dunaway.Meanwhile Washington gets to show another young actor how stardom is done. Previous pupils include Ethan Hawke (""Training Day) and Chris Pine (""Unstoppable). Reynolds actually gets better the longer hes in Washingtons company. Otherwise hes asked to be an action figure which is what Washington is also doing to some extent but he - along with his stunt double - does that with soul.Washingtons serenity is absurd. Yet its exactly whats needed in a by-the-numbers chase-em-down and shoot-em-up with lots of intentionally sea-sickening camerawork confidence. The director Daniel Espinosa is a Swede making his first Hollywood movie and nothing he does distinguishes ""Safe House within a genre whose bar was elevated by the ""Bourne movies. He manages the brawls and shootouts just fine. But like a lot of movies too many of the fights and too much of the flight look like theyve been pulsed in a blender which either insults or rescues the stunt choreographer. Not that theres much to eagerly follow in the screenplay which is credited to David Guggenheim but feels so homogenized that the ethical breaches and double-agent stuff have no sting. So many people are risking and giving their lives and we barely care.Showtime just aired a version of this sort of ambiguous-agent plot with ""Homeland a series whose incisive writing directing and acting make it difficult to enjoy a movie as chewed-up-and-spit-out as ""Safe House. That displeasure goes for Washington too. Even as this jowlier thicker-middled man (you hate to ask but could the baggy silken shirts be from the Steven Seagal ""Still Kicking collection?) its very easy to watch him here.But ""Safe House is also the latest outing - ""Man on Fire ""The Book of Eli and ""Unstoppable are some recent others - that makes you pleased to have the swaggering intensity virility professionalism and cool that Denzel Washington brings to his work. Its just that I watch these movies and think about ""Training Day ""Inside Man ""American Gangster or ""The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 and realize Im not getting the most of his charisma or enough of that million-dollar dental work. Im not getting the joy and I miss that.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

(Jasin Boland) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 9 2012 1216 PM Title Safe House Film Info A CIA underling meets a rogue agent. With Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds. Director Daniel Espinosa. (150) R Violence language. At area theaters. In some ads for ""Safe House"" an image of Ryan Reynolds stalks next to a close-up of Denzel Washington who scowls over the tagline ""No One Is Safe."" If the star of last years ""Green Lantern"" ""The Change-Up"" and ""Fireflies in the Garden"" is in this movie Washington should indeed worry -- no one is safe. To be fair Reynolds who was underserved in 2011 by a trio of bad movies isnt the worst thing in ""Safe House"" a dejected-looking action-drama with the now-de rigueur look of a movie dipped in coffee stains. (Theres barely a shot that doesnt look yellowish and scratched in an attempt to look ""edgy."") Director Daniel Espinosa has essentially made a murky serious ""Midnight Run"" set against standard bad-goings-on-at-Langley shenanigans. Reynolds is Matt Weston a CIA trainee waiting for his big assignment to come through. Babysitting a safe house in Cape Town he gets his chance at the big time when a legendary rogue agent named Tobin Frost (Washington) is assigned to Westons temporary-holding spy shelter. Frost has been off the grid and on his own for over 20 years. Once a star at the CIA he saw unethical dealings and decided hed rather be a freelance thorn in its side. Now possessing incriminating intel -- its in a vial hes injected in his leg -- he lets himself be captured to get out of a tough spot. Frost and Weston bond over a secret agents lonely life and soon the two are on the run together. The best moments in ""Safe House"" are when Washington -- sitting out most fight scenes by dint of having done decades of great work -- sits and glowers at the violence around him. Its admirable how he can sit a room away and still be the center of attention. Hes equally compelling taunting his CIA torturers with blank-faced amiability or imparting wisdom to the naive Weston. But ""Safe House"" devolves into unexciting action scenes that feel left over from the ""Bourne"" flicks and are peopled with cloak-and-dagger stereotypes. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson have thumbnail-sketch roles -- shes an Agency lieutenant hes a sneaky field general -- while Sam Shepard is barky perfection as chief spook. The stars though are a mismatch. Reynolds is too self-aware to play innocents and in scenes with his dewy French sweetheart his approximation of a forlorn puppy is irritating. Washington with two Oscars and at almost 60 years old can do movies like this in his sleep which is better than many actors do awake. Washington is secure in ""Safe House"" wheedling and goading the less morally authoritative around him. He should be wary however of films that dont deserve his talent for making a home out of anywhere he hangs his hat. Magic Moment At a new safe house Reynolds realizes other low-level CIA trainees are just as dangerous when bored.

Hardly the first movie to envision the CIA as a hotbed of corruption secrecy and deadly internecine warfare ""Safe House"" is a viciously energetic South Africa-set actioner that makes up in sweaty atmosphere and brute force what it lacks in surprise. Swift but overlong this mechanically effective Hollywood debut from Swedish-born helmer Daniel Espinosa (""Easy Money"") doesnt have an original bone in its body -- or by the end an unbroken bone between its two leads. Cat-and-mouse pairing of Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds should land punchy if not pulverizing B.O. blows at home and overseas. The first-produced screenplay by David Guggenheim superficially recalls the template of 2001s ""Training Day"" in that it casts Washington as a ruthless not-to-be-trusted avatar of violence playing malevolent mentor to a white-male rookie. But there are also shades of the ""Bourne"" movies present in the pics slamming edits and herky-jerky handheld camerawork its de rigueur cynicism toward dirty agency politics and its restless toggling between the men in the field and the CIA suits trying to hunt them down. At the heart of the matter lies a particularly hoary MacGuffin a classified list of operatives and agency secrets that must be protected at any cost. That means capturing Tobin Frost (Washington) a murderous rogue spy who has eluded the CIA for years but has now surfaced in Cape Town with the incriminating file in his possession. A man with many enemies as well as a name perhaps calculated to evoke serial killers and Santa Claus Frost is ambushed by thugs barely five minutes in and winds up surrendering at the CIAs nearest safe house. The housekeeper on duty there is Matt Weston (Reynolds) an agency greenhorn in love with his unsuspecting French g.f. (Nora Arnezeder) bored with his far-flung outpost and ready for an exciting career in international espionage. Frosts arrival turns out to be his make-or-break career opportunity When the aforementioned thugs launch a ferocious attack on the safe house Weston must go on the run with Frost ensuring that he doesnt let him get away -- and isnt killed by either the attackers or Frost himself. Frost of course is not about to make this easy for him. When hes not turning the tables on Weston in the middle of a crowded stadium or grabbing the wheel from him in one of the films many extended vehicular smash-em-ups this most skilled of assassins attempts to wage a subtler form of psychological warfare. Yet the cruel put-downs feel second-rate the anti-CIA sentiments could have been lifted from a blotter and the old-pro/young-gun dynamic never rises above routine. Washington as cool and formidable a presence as ever is none too energized by his material which requires him to drop thinly veiled taunts about Westons sexual preferences and mutter tough-guy cliches about how impossible it is for a spy to sustain a meaningful relationship. You dont say. Reynolds comes off as much more alert and engaged by comparison in part because both he and his character have more to prove. Appearing opposite a heavyweight co-star in an action-heavy vehicle that requires far more in terms of bodily endurance than f/x-laden extravaganzas like ""Green Lantern"" the thesp rolls up his sleeves benefiting from his ability to project intelligence as well as insecurity often simultaneously. Supporting cast includes Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard as three CIA execs whose various hidden allegiances will come as no surprise to anyone paying attention as well as Ruben Blades as a world-weary old ally of Frosts who gets closest to supplying the film with a cold bruised heart. Perhaps aware that his characters will compel interest only to the extent that theyre in danger at all times Espinosa puts Frost and Weston through the physical wringer dispensing bullet holes and stab wounds like party favors while giving stunt coordinators Greg Powell and Grant Hulley fight coordinator Oliver Schneider and second unit director/d.p. Alexander Witt ample room to cut loose. Lenser Oliver Wood keeps the cameras on the move and editor Richard Pearson adds another layer of disorientation by slicing and dicing every other scene into a barely coherent frenzy. In contrast with the fragmented kineticism of Paul Greengrass ""Bourne"" movies theres no existential dimension to the shattered-glass aesthetic here; its just raw chaotic action inelegantly shot and staged but no less unnerving for it. Pic extracts considerable production value from its Cape Town shoot most impressively during a chase scene set in the township of Langa which finds Frost evading capture by leaping across slum rooftops. The ensuing destruction of homes provides an apt image of U.S. powers reducing Third World civilization to rubble while putting a cruel spin on the pics title though no one involved seems aware or particularly sympathetic.

"Review Safe House a bumpy ride - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Safe House a bumpy ride with Denzel in the drivers seat --  1/2 I dont know much about you other than having surprisingly free and unfettered access to your credit history but me? Well the new year comes around (once a year like clockwork) and Im still catching up with some movies that came out in December. Yet they keep making new ones. They do. All the time. Big ones small ones. Here are 10 well be seeing over the next three months. Ive already seen three all worthwhile; one made my Top 10 of 2011 list and may well win the foreign-language-film Oscar. Dates are of course subject to change. -- Michael Phillips Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Early on in the derivative but fairly absorbing blur titled ""Safe House""set in Cape Town South Africa Denzel Washingtons Tobin Frost a spy in from the cold is brought to a Central Intelligence Agency safe house so that he can be asked a few questions about the super-secret intel he has in his possession. Wordlessly Washington sits in a chair as a supporting player (Robert Patrick) prepares for the waterboarding and in one five-second progression Washington smiles drops his head lifts it back up -- and his face has morphed into that of a man who has killed and will be killing again very soon.The moment may or may not have been scripted but you certainly appreciate it. You also appreciate how Swedish-born director Daniel Espinosa delivers harsh jolts a beat before you expect this car to smash into that car or this character to calmly pull out a gun and murder that one. Editor Richard Pearson surely shares the credit for those jagged edges. Make no mistake though No matter how much ""Safe House"" owes to the look feel concerns and cutting of Paul Greengrass ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" its closer in quality to a Tony Scott movie of which Washington has made several. For all its lip service to the human cost of brutal espionage tactics and murky geopolitical allies screenwriter David Guggenheims movie wouldnt have a reason for being without its brutality. The carnage gets fairly absurd toward the end just when you dont want your spy thriller to get that way.Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Frosts handler the CIA operative who has languished for a year in Cape Town disguising himself as a health worker while bugging his boss back at Langley played by Brendan Gleeson for a better post. (Nora Arnezeder portrays his nominal French love interest.) Frost has been ""off the grid"" (the expression comes up a lot here) for a decade but when an intel-for-cash transaction goes haywire the wily ex-CIA star turns himself in and finds himself whisked off to the safe house. It is promptly attacked by mercenaries looking for Frost and his precious intel and from there the film becomes an extended frenzied action sequence. Following the ""Bourne"" template those muttering back in the CIA headquarters control room cannot control a damn thing. Sam Shepard and Vera Farmiga lend easy authority to their basically functional roles. Theres a bit of a mystery regarding for whom the mercenaries are working. But you can probably figure it out. I did and thats saying something. Typically I am figuring things out in movies like ""Safe House"" even after the big revelation.Director Espinosa shoots virtually everything in tight but wobbly close-up and the human and vehicular combat often brakes right at the edge of visual incoherence. Just as often the brakes give out completely. Even at its most frantic and mechanical the movie relies on Washington to provide a visual anchor some sociopathic calm amid the storm.mjphillipstribune.comSafe House -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence throughout and some language)Running time 155Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Espionage and Intelligence Politics and Government Action (Movie Genre) Central Intelligence Agency Safe House (movie) Robert Patrick The Bourne Ultimatum (movie) 10 best movies of 2011 Journey 2 gets wasted in paradise --  1/2 Madonnas W.E. all dressed up going nowhere --  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0208-safe-house-20120209,0,3035328.column",200,safehouse24,safehouse,chicagotribune

Safe House Fair Director Daniel Espinosa. Cast Denzel Washington Ryan Reynolds Brendan Gleeson. Rating R for strong violence throughout and some language. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Denzel Washington Director Daniel Espinosa would have done well to remember that in his film ""Safe House."" Certainly Tobin Frost the rogue CIA agent Washington plays has a murderous reputation and he snaps a few necks along the way. But too often Washington is made to simply sit and observe -- which is not a fatal mistake because he is such a good actor that even then hes worth watching. Worse though at times hes gone altogether. Thats not the only flaw in the fairly straightforward thriller but its the biggest. Denzel Washingtons most bad-ass roles When Washington is paired with Ryan Reynolds Matt Weston an inexperienced agent trying to bring him in the movie is intriguing; you can sense Frost seeping into Westons consciousness despite Westons best efforts to prevent it. (""Im already in your head"" Frost tells a defiant Weston at one point and you can tell they both know its true.) Weston has spent 12 months guarding a safe house in South Africa -- a safe house with no one in it. He has a beautiful girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) a medical-school student who knows nothing of his real work. Not that its very exciting. Weston spends his hours on duty bored out of his skull. He openly campaigns with his superior David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) for a better assignment but for the time being hes stuck where he is. Enter Frost -- literally. After conducting some nefarious business and escaping assassins in a chaotic chase scene Frost turns himself in to the U.S. Consulate. A man whom the government has been seeking for nine years deposits himself on the doorstep. Under the orders of Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard) the assistant CIA director Frost is transferred to Westons safe house which is almost immediately attacked. Amid the carnage Frost convinces Weston that they need to escape to stay alive -- keeping Frost alive being part of Westons mission after all. So they go on the lam. Weston knows that his job is to get Frost the most wanted man on the planet into some form of traditional custody. But for reasons that sound sort of ridiculous no extraction teams can reach them for 18 hours so they have to just kind of mill around and wait. You know baby-sitting the most dangerous killer in the world. Alone. Guess how that goes. Washington hasnt won two Oscars for nothing; hes a great actor. And Reynolds is underrated. But without giving too much away David Guggenheims script requires that they not spend the entire movie together which is too bad. Washington conveys a sense of menace with just a hint of a smile -- what is this guy thinking? you wonder suspecting that it cant be good. But the script is riddled with cliches; Shepard in particular has to utter some groaners that must have pained him greatly. Vera Farmiga finds herself in a similar situation as a professional rival of Gleesons Barlow. There are twists in the plot of course -- this is an action thriller. And Espinosa knows his way around a shoot-em-up scene though his reliance on a shaky hand-held camera coupled with the films overheated color scheme is interesting for about five minutes; unfortunately the movie lasts 115. The minutes in which Washington and Reynolds play their mind games together are rewarding. Everything else feels as if there is something missing no doubt because there is.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In 1987 Denzel Washington picked up the first of five Oscar nominations--he went on to win two for Glory and Training Day--playing anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko in Cry Freedom. A quarter century later in Safe House the ageless Washington (a Safe House document-forger played by Ruben Blades admiringly calls him a black Dorian Gray) returns to South Africa to play another legend. This time though its a fictional character and the circumstances are vastly different. Still Washington brings the full weight of his iconic presence and history to the initially juicy role of a brilliant CIA operative turned traitor whose awed contemporaries speak of him in hushed terms. Like Hannibal Lecter hes the kind of titanic force who poses more of a threat handcuffed and tied to a chair than his adversaries do fully armed. Washington stars as a notorious international rogue who confuses the CIA by willingly turning himself in to the American embassy in South Africa. When Washington survives a bloodbath that leaves many of his CIA captors dead a surviving young operative played by Ryan Reynolds is in the perilous position of having to transport the wily manipulative Washington to a safe house in the countryside while being pursued by a mysterious group of heavily armed men. Safe House does altogether too good a job establishing Washington as a seemingly unbeatable adversary He brings so much gravity to his role that Reynolds seems hopelessly overmatched. Reynolds is perfectly acceptable as a CIA upstart in over his head though hes far less convincing following his transformation into a standard-issue action hero equal parts super-spy and overgrown Boy Scout. Thanks largely to Washingtons sly performance and Daniel Espinosas taut direction Safe House gets off to a strong start but the tension slackens halfway through and never recovers. Safe House devolves into slick mediocrity whenever it attends to the goings-on at CIA headquarters where cliched characters and stiff dialogue defeat the slumming likes of Sam Shepard Brendan Gleeson and Vera Farmiga playing yet another tough-but-fair authority figure. When Washington escapes Reynolds control the groaning familiarity of the Langley scenes begin to infect the movie as a whole. For a generic-looking thriller Safe House gets off to an overachieving start but by the time it lurches to an overly pat conclusion it has thoroughly squandered its considerable early promise.

"Safe House | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; safe-house ) Safe House (United States/South Africa 2012) February 08 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Safe House is an overlong underwhelming knock-off of The Bourne Identity - another generic spy thriller in which the ""bad guy"" (a traitor) is the good guy (because hes at war against corruption) and the ""good guys"" (government agents) are the bad guys (because they are corrupt). There are car chases double-crosses and copious amounts of graphic violence all of which add up to very little. The pacing is uneven the frenetic action is rarely suspenseful the dialogue is neither witty nor intelligent and the anticlimactic endgame drags out to an improbable conclusion. Safe House has B-movie sensibilities with an A-list cast - a formula that sometimes provides reasonable entertainment except in a situation like this when its plain most of the well-known players are on hand for purposes of refreshing their bank accounts. The well-cut trailer makes Safe House seem like a great recipe for two hours of espionage-tinged thrills with a Machiavellian antagonist worthy to stand alongside The Dark Knights Joker. The reality is its a combination of undercooked ingredients and recycled plot elements and the ""villain"" of the full production is a pale shadow of what he appears to be in the preview. No one seems truly invested in the project - not Denzel Washington whose performance is bland and monochromatic nor Ryan Reynolds whos too earnest to be believable. Swedish director Daniel Espinosas style is reminiscent of that of Tony Scott (at his worst) with a lot of shaky hand-held shots. Cape Town where most of the action takes place comes across as a hellhole - South Africas tourism division will not be using Safe House to promote this as a vacation spot. The storyline uses the tired scenario of a corrupt CIA mole doing everything within his/her power to avoid discovery. That includes killing the man who has obtained a file containing proof of the misdeeds of every American and British agent on the take. This man Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is a former elite agent who went rogue a decade ago and has been in hiding since then. He has been branded as a traitor by his former employees but his name is legendary. When he unexpectedly walks into the U.S. Consulate in South Africa no one is sure of his motives. He is transferred to a safe house for interrogation. A hit squad pursuing him locates the safe house and slaughters everyone there except Tobin and untried agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) who survive the massacre and go on the run. The CIA gives Weston orders about where to go but since theres a mole in Langley the bad guys are always one step ahead. The screenplay credited to David Guggenheim offers little thats new exciting or surprising. The action sequences are generic character development is perfunctory and the supposed plot twists are obvious. Anyone who doesnt know the identity of the mole within the first ten minutes must be new to the spy thriller genre. At nearly two hours the movie is at least 30 minutes too long which results in periods of tired exposition and sequences with no real payoff. This is a case of a script that needed at least another round of polishing before being put into production. Safe House tries to be a little different by not transforming into a buddy film. No warmth is evident between Frost and Weston who remain adversaries almost to the end. Some sort of relationship however might have been preferable. By not feeding off one another the characters remain inert; theres no urgency or spark in their interaction - they are merely sharing the screen when required by the story. Frost is as much of an enigma at the end as at the beginning although his aura of invincibility has been punctured. Weston on the other hand transforms with little motivation into a crusader. Washington could do this role in his sleep which is close to what he accomplishes. For an actor with such range and ability its a disappointment to see him bring so little to a part that cries out for a bravura performance. Despite his strong work in Buried Reynolds has yet to show the ability to carry an action film (The Green Lantern in fact offers evidence to the contrary) and Safe House argues that hes too lightweight for darker material. The secondary cast which includes accomplished character actors Brendan Gleeson Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard represents a wasted pool of talent. For the most part they sit around in a situation room in Langley and provide background information on Frost and Weston. The decision to release Safe House in the middle of February can be seen as a tacit admission by Universal Pictures that expectations are limited. Films like this if they wow a distributor will be favorably placed for a summer or holiday slot. Safe House probably looked better on paper than it does on film which is regrettably true of many movies dotting the multiplex landscape at this time of year. One can only hope that 2012s ""legitimate"" Bourne sequel offers more than this lackluster Bourne imitation.

In the opening scenes of Safe House you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost an American spy in Cape Town South Africa who is five steps ahead of everyone else. His look is pure sleight of hand In glasses gray scarf and overcoat with an earring a serious goatee and his gray-flecked hair teased out Washington resembles a hipster Malcolm X -- a great look for him even if it feels like a costume. Meeting with an MI6 agent Tobin purchases the mother of all top secret files then wastes no time pulling out a lab kit that allows him to inject the file right under his skin. Very tricky Moments later hes under attack (a lot of folks want that file) so he turns himself in to the U.S. consulate. Only then do we learn that Frost is a rogue agent who ditched the CIA and has spent nine years trading secrets with Americas enemies. Why has he done this? And why has he decided to turn himself in? Those questions form the bedrock of Washingtons hyper-cool minimalist performance. As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga Brendan Gleeson Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) whos been twiddling his thumbs there for a year. When thugs enter yet somehow fail to find Frost tethered to a chair he and Matt escape gunning through the streets in a smash-and-grab car chase. The movie as if on an action time clock punches in the standard set pieces bloody fights clattering shoot-outs an escape through a packed soccer stadium. Some of this stuff is well-done and some of it has been done a lot better. Yet Safe House even when its pummeling you effectively has very little up its sleeve. Basically the movie is a fizzless Bourne episode crossed with Training Day featuring Washington as a good-egg-gone-rotten who you know has his reasons. Mostly he schools Matt his guard-turned-pursuer in what it means to lie. Reynolds is physically impressive even if his acting here consists of morphing from a deer-in-the-headlights look to a mean squint as the movie goes on. The director Daniel Espinosa shoots in highly saturated colors edits everything into a frenzy and creates the illusion of intrigue. But compared with a superior potboiler like Salt which messed with your brain in entertainingly far-fetched ways Safe House is action-movie porridge gussied up into a less-clever-than-it-seems mystery. Which is why the trickiness of Washingtons performance begins to ebb replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything.

She then went on to fiddle with her BlackBerry for half the movie. Based on those two actions she is I think this scattered but not totally disagreeable CIA conspiracy thrillers ideal audience appreciative enough of Ryan Reynoldss body to accept a world-spanning espionage drama staked on his value as a boyfriend--and beyond that not paying too much attention.Reynolds plays Matt Weston a junior CIA agent assigned to babysit a safe house in Cape Town South Africa. The house has gone unused for Matts entire 12-month stay there and hes dying to be transferred to Paris where his adorable girlfriend Ana (French actress Nora Arnezeder) is scheduled to take a job in two weeks. But his boss (Brendan Gleeson) tells Matt he needs to prove himself. Then an extremely high-value ""guest"" checks into the house rogue agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington). Frost has apparently been trafficking in global intelligence secrets for a decade and has just survived an attempt on his life. Hes escorted into the safe house by CIA agents who--to Matts wide-eyed surprise--start water boarding their detainee as soon as hes ""safely"" inside. When the guys hired to kill Frost show up and interrupt the interrogation Matt sees an opportunity to shore up his own cred and escapes the ambush with Frost in tow.If Matt can deliver Frost into the CIAs hands alive hell get the promotion he needs to join Ana in Paris. If he cant at best hell be dressed down and demoted; at worst hell be marked as a rogue agent himself and will not only have to run for his life but will also never be able to see his girlfriend again.One minor character refers to Frost as ""the black Dorian Gray"" which elicits a chuckle precisely because the actor who plays him seems to be frozen in time in a bad way Washington can do the ""enigmatic"" anti-hero posturing that constitutes the bulk of this role in his sleep. The only interesting acting in the film comes in the few sustained dialogue scenes between the films two stars in which Frost uses what he surmises about Matts yen for domesticity to get inside his head planting seeds that its the loving plump-lipped blonde not the agency thats truly worthy of Matts loyalty.Grainy and hyper-saturated Safe House has the distinct look of deliberate ""amateur"" cinematography taken to its abstract limit by Bourne series DP Oliver Woods handheld zoom-happy camera. Most of the fight and chase scenes register not as action but as blasts and blurs of vivid color. Is this accidental or an acknowledgement that scrutability is not a paramount value of the contemporary action sequence? Either way after one duel Reynolds has a line of dialogue recapping his injury to the man who inflicted it.This style works best when choreographed across vast canvases or in extremely contained spaces. Two scenes in which Washington evades his pursuers in high-tension crowds--one set at a soccer stadium and the other at a street protest--are highlights. In the tensest most satisfying set piece the camera stays tight on two men wrestling on the floor in a lock each of them grasping for weapon-ready shards of the window they just smashed through.As hinted first by that early instance of water boarding Safe House turns into a vague critique of systemic government corruption but the most telling aspect of that scene is not the torture Washington is subjected to but how Reynolds is captured reacting with the way-zoomed lens framed on his dreamboat lips parted in incredulity. This shot is one of several tying Matts conscience to his physical beauty and thus intermingling the urgency of his success defending old-school American values--or whatever--with his success as a romantic hero. A movie in no small part about the insanely high collateral body count of moral relativism Safe House has its younger star sustain only one serious injury to the gasp-inducing midsection he was sculpting in that first shot. Now thats a high-value target.

TWITTER Swedish director Daniel Espinosas action-thriller starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds is a two-hour cat-and-mouse game with a few brief breaks to catch its breath. Essentially a two-hour chase with a few brief breaks to catch its breath Safe House is an elemental cat-and-mouse game elaborated to the point of diminishing returns. Terse and understated this is a spy vs. spy tale designed to minimize talk and maximize action not at all a bad thing in movies but over-worked to near-exhaustion here. Star names of Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds will assure a robust opening for this muscular winter attraction the stripped-down simplicity of which should play particularly well overseas. PHOTOS Hollywoods 10 Highest-Grossing Actors David Guggenheims nuts-and-bolts screenplay is mainly about one thing A renegade CIA agent has information some of the gang back in Washington D.C. might not want out there so it comes down to their relentlessness versus his resourcefulness. Such a premise can be enough if the filmmaker in charge is a master of suspenseful minutia a born storyteller capable of elaborating any small situation into a captivating tale a wizard with images and of stretching a yarn to just before the breaking point. Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Snabba Cash) is not on that level--not yet anyway--although the style he employs to follows the far-ranging action--something resembling a surveillance camera surreptitiously eavesdropping on movements and incidents not meant to be witnessed--is entirely apt for the subject at hand. Especially when the action is outdoors and on the street the slightly stylized coverage is often managed from above where a permanent camera might plausibly be positioned a strategy that contributes a fresh layer of visual pungency. VIDEO Denzel Washington Goes Rogue in Safe House Trailer Having been off the grid as they say for a decade veteran agent Tobin Frost (Washington) is considered ""one of the most notorious traitors weve got"" according to CIA big shot Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard); he ""turned"" years ago and has been selling damaging information ever since. When Tobin abruptly decides to turn himself in he is remanded to the care of agency novice Matt Weston (Reynolds) whos been languishing in Cape Town South Africa waiting for a plum assignment; hes got one now. Given his notoriety Tobins got some tough and well-armed guys after him wherever he goes perhaps especially now because hes got a tiny file containing explosive info that hes embedded under his skin. Be they terrorists mercenaries or CIA ops his pursuers force Tobin and Matt out of their safe house and keep gunning for them at regular intervals thereafter which means very few minutes of Safe House ever go by with an exchange of fire or muscle power. STORY Scarlett Johansson Denzel Washington Win Germanys Golden Camera Hovering distantly in the background is the contrast between Tobins worldly cynicism and Matts hitherto untested optimistic view of how life should operate. In the nasty world of ever-present assassins and the CIA which complicates things further by sending two Langley operatives (Vera Farmiga and Brenda Gleeson) into the field after them the naive student has to catch up to reality but fast which he does as the besieged men carefully make their way from the city to a township and finally to an isolated ranch for a final showdown. With his charisma doing most of the work to envelop his character with the requisite alluring mystery Washington nicely combines a world-weariness with a persistent alertness to the moment the latter a constant requisite if Tobin is to survive yet another day. Reynolds does seem very green by comparison and one can hardly blame him for wishing he could just get back together with his comely blond girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) in Paris but being thrown into some extremely intense mano a mano combat situations seems to be just the ticket to make a man out of him. Dramatically the film hangs together well enough but the repetitive nature of the action and lack of stylistic shadings and nuance ultimately prove rather grinding. The relatively unfamiliar Cape Town and vicinity locations add a measure of fresh visual interest while Oliver Wood who shot the first two Bourne installments has worked with Espinosa to fashion an even more rough-and-ready style here abetted in its grunginess by production designer Brigitte Broch.
