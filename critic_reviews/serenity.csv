The worst fate that could befall Serenity would be if it failed to reach a non-genre audience because it works very hard to welcome newcomers to its textured futuristic mythology while daring to push existing fans way beyond their comfort zone. This is what the Star Wars prequels could have been if George Lucas were a purveyor of hip ultra-smart pop culture rather than... well choose the epithets yourself. Five centuries from now ex-soldier Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his ragtag crew ply their semi-legal transporting trade on the sparsely settled fringes of space. When Doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his fugitive sister River (Summer Glau) seek sanctuary on his utilitarian spaceship Serenity it is targeted by The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a glacial assassin employed by The Alliance. River is an unstable and troublesome telepath - created by The Alliances own Frankensteinian scientists - yet the anti-heroic Reynolds and his renegade crew risk all to save her. With its Hawksian attention to group dynamics and its skilful definition of character through action this supremely entertaining hybrid-movie plays like Rio Bravo in space. The textured narrative is peopled by precisely delineated characters who employ a salty retro-future-speak in which twenty-fifth century slang is morphed with frontier Western archaisms (take umbrage confound these bungers). The settings and tone are hyper-real yet the human behaviour is grounded and credible the moral conflicts complex and involving. Shiny intelligent fun.

"Serenity | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; serenity ) Serenity (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli This is only the second time it has happened. By ""it"" Im referring to the process by which a science fiction television show is canceled becomes a cult hit after its removal from the air and is brought back to life as a major motion picture with the original cast. Serenity Joss Whedons follow-up to his defunct TV project Firefly thus enters rarefied territory. The only other franchise to make such a lofty claim is Star Trek. (To be fair X-Files did something similar although it was still on the air when the movie reached theaters.) The box office numbers will determine where the Firefly characters go from here to a sequel to a new TV series or to the dusty part of a DVD shelf. One question thats impossible to answer for a Firefly fan is whether the film works on its own. To that end I have avoided the TV series for the sake of this review. I have been tempted to sample it (opportunities abound) but have avoided doing so. My goal with this review is to present the perspective of someone who appreciates science fiction but has never been exposed to Joss Whedons universe (I never saw Buffy or Angel either). Fan reviews have flooded the net. This is an opportunity for a different point-of-view. Serenity is a fast-paced engaging science fiction adventure tale. The emphasis should be on ""adventure;"" the ""science fiction"" just gives Whedon (making his directorial debut) an interesting canvas to paint upon. In many ways the film is old-fashioned. The space-ships are not sleek and streamlined - theyre hunks of junk being held together by paperclips and masking tape. The characters talk like they learned English in the 19th century Old West (with occasional Chinese curses thrown in for good measure). And guns fire bullets not laser blasts. This is one of the key elements that separates the Star Trek camp from the (new) Battlestar Galactica one. Serenity falls in the latter ""retro"" category. The storyline is set up economically albeit with a little too much starting exposition. A 17-year old telepath named River (Summer Glau) is being manipulated by this universes version of the Evil Empire (called the Alliance) to become a weapon. She is rescued by her brother Simon (Sean Maher) and the two seek refuge upon the mercenary ship Serenity. The ship is captained by Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) a war veteran who is more compassionate than he lets on. His crew consists of his second-in-command Zoe (Gina Torres); her husband and the ships pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk); Kaylee (Jewel Staite) an engineer whos prettier than Scotty; and Jayne (Adam Baldwin) a tough-talking bruiser. At first having River and Simon on board doesnt seem to be a problem but Simons unwillingness to take orders and Rivers increasing mental instability generate friction. Then a real problem becomes apparent River is being pursued by one of the Alliances elite operatives (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and he will stop at nothing to eliminate her. This puts the crew of Serenity in the cross-hairs of a galactic showdown. For a two-hour movie the characters - even the secondary ones - are remarkably well-drawn. The ones with the most screen time and opportunity to establish themselves are Mal and River. Kaylee and Simon have a coy romantic subplot. Jayne gets all the good one-liners. Wash and Zoe dont have a lot to do but I assume they had their moments in the TV series. The newcomer is the Operative and hes about as interesting as villains get. This guy isnt your usual run-of-the-mill megalomaniac or battle-hardened warrior. His motives may be simple but his characterization isnt. As played by talented actor Chiwetel Ejiofor he is arguably Serenitys greatest asset. The characters and circumstances reminded me of the late 70s/early 80s British science fiction series Blakes 7. There as here theres plenty of tension amongst the crewmen. Some are more in the crusader mold than others. Some are in it purely for the money. Some are affable some are antisocial. And theres plenty of bitterness anger and resentment to go along. Comparing Serenity to Blakes 7 is compliment since I consider the earlier TV show to be the best science fiction program ever to appear on the small screen. There are similarities and those represent strengths for both franchises. There are plenty of special effects including an impressive space battle that while not on the same level as the one that started off Revenge of the Sith is nice enough in its own right. But Serenity isnt about effects. Its about narrative and characters and it does a solid job in both areas. Whedon propels the story along at a breakneck pace but keeps it smooth enough that we never get lost and occasionally pauses to allow for character interaction. There are plenty of ""fan moments"" but they dont interfere with the overall viewing experience. And there are times when the unexpected occurs. Being space mercenaries harboring a fugitive can be a dangerous business and Whedon doesnt shirk from bringing death into this movie. The film leaves open the possibility of future adventures - whether they materialize remains to be seen. Whedon went all-out for the fans with Serenity including going so far as to hold special pre-release screenings in the late spring. (The final cut was reportedly tweaked based on audience response.) For the average movie-goer the movie may not have the same emotional resonance it achieves for Firefly aficionados but those who enjoy science fiction adventure will find plenty to appreciate. Its self-contained and entertaining - arguably the two things most necessary for Serenity to soar.

"Serenity A Wild Ride With Some New Space Cowboys washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Serenity A Wild Ride With Some New Space Cowboys Above Summer Glau rages against the Alliance (and anyone else in her way) in ""Serenity."" Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin right are two of the rebel crew members. (Sidney Baldwin - AP) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 30 2005 In Joss Whedons ""Serenity"" set 500 years in the future Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his mercenary crew ride a rust-bucket spaceship the Serenity custom-built for rapid getaways. These contraband wheeler-dealers are ready for rough ridin wearing cowboy boots six-gun holsters and bandoleers. Half a millennium after Neil Armstrongs one small step for mankind and were back in the saddle again. Not surprisingly Mal and company have their enemies. There are the Alliance goons soldiers of the Big Brotherly federation that rules the solar system. Theyve been hunting Mal and his rebel-yellers ever since the civil war -- which Mals side lost. Then there are the flesh-eating Reavers. You dont want to dawdle when those guys show up hungry. Fans of ""Firefly"" the fabulous but short-lived TV show that spawned this movie mourned when the 2002 series was canceled after only 12 weeks. But in the now traditional kabuki of fan power their enthusiastic snapping up of the shows DVDs prompted Universal to pony up 50 million for the big-screen version. Theyll be thrilled at this reunion of endearing rogues. It should be stressed right away ""Serenity"" isnt just for the ""Firefly"" set. Writer-director Whedon -- who meteor-showered Planet Earth with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" -- is a pop culture ringmaster whose bullwhip dialogue flamboyant characters and narrative genius can make an exhilarating three-ring show out of anything. ""Serenity"" proves that conclusively. Sure in the retelling Whedon has had to boil off a lot of the complexity of the series. But the enjoyable result is a highly concentrated amphetamine-fueled reprise designed to give fans a sentimental jolt and boost new devotees. If newcomers feel overwhelmed by the fast-moving details theyll be drawn back in by the otherworldly mayhem. ""We might experience some turbulence"" Mal announces matter-of-factly into the Serenity intercom as the ship endures yet another attack. ""And then explode."" ""I dont want to explode"" says crew member Jayne (Adam Baldwin) as if in this loco universe someone might consider the other option. When Mal provides passage for a tight-lipped nervy doctor and his seemingly catatonic sister River Tam (Summer Glau) a new hell is set to yawn open. River is a 17-year-old psychic whose powers to understand the deepest secrets of the Alliance put her (and the Serenity crew) at massive risk. Thats where a ruthless Alliance assassin named the Operative (smooth n cool Chiwetel Ejiofor) comes in. Most of the crew would sell their mothers to Reavers for a small bag of gold but they decide to protect River -- on rebel principle. That turns out to be a mistake. River gives new meaning to the term ""problem passenger."" Suffering mental damage from the gruesome mind experiments the Alliance subjected her to shes a 90-pound time bomb with kung fu skills. In her bouts of manic wigginess she doesnt always differentiate between friend and foe. ""Shes starting to damage my calm"" says Jayne after suffering a River special in his nether regions. ""Serenity"" may be little more than an ultra-sophisticated chase movie with a big showdown at the communications pad of Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz) who functions as a sort of Richie Rich with his all-news space station. But the real joy comes from the dysfunctional rebel family whether its the screwball tension between Mal and love interest Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin) the ships courtesan who plies her trade to passengers much to Mals chagrin; or the dime-novelly language of Jayne as he says of the Reavers ""Eating people alive -- where does that get fun?"" Theyre a futuristic King Arthurs round table or Dirty Dozen or Robin Hood and his Merry Men; heck theyre even ""Seinfeld."" And no matter whats coming their way post-apocalyptic doom or gloom this James Gang of the galaxy is just plain fun to watch. Serenity (119 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence profanity and sexual themes.

Trouble brews on ship as the crew of Serenity (L to R) GINA TORRES as Zoe ALAN ... more Photo Universal Pictures Serenity earns director Whedon spot on sci-fis Mount Rushmore 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Serenity Science fiction. Starring Nathan Fillion Gina Torres Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass. Directed by Joss Whedon. (PG-13. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Serenity"" is the movie version of ""Firefly"" a 2002 television series so spectacularly unsuccessful that only a handful of episodes aired before the Fox network canceled it. If longevity is the criterion Hollywood should have produced films based on ""Fastlane"" ""Murder One"" and ""After MASH"" years before this project arrived at a theater near you. Yet as challenging as it must have been to pilot Joss Whedons space opera from the TV junk pile to the big screen the finished product is a triumph. ""Serenity"" was clearly written by someone who grew up worshiping at the altar of Han Solo and the space marines in ""Aliens"" but this genre picture is still a thrillingly original science fiction creation. The writing is as good as in the best ""Star Trek"" episodes while offering a thoughtfully bleak vision of the future that brings to mind ""Blade Runner."" After his decade of solid work as a television and movie writer specializing in sci-fi and fantasy this could be the accomplishment that puts Whedons face alongside those of James Cameron Ridley Scott and Sam Raimi on the geek Mount Rushmore. Related Stories TV flop transforms into a film with a future in hearts of nerds / Failed series on Fox a worthy space opera this time around Whedon wrote and directed ""Serenity"" using many of his signature ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" moves. Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his crew are introduced in a long steady-cam shot which sweeps by each character during a comically unstable entry into a planets atmosphere. The fight scenes later in the movie are kinetic and brutal but also infused with witty dialogue. And even though antiheroes abound the audience never has to wonder whom to root for when the action begins. But as a matter of production design ""Serenity"" is a bold and complicated movie. Since his TV series was canceled Whedon seems to have invested most of his time in guessing what our society will look like in 500 years. There are very rich planets and very poor ones and the inevitable tensions have resulted in a war that didnt go very well for those without means. Cameras are everywhere and the Internet has progressed to the point where video of that trip you made to a bar on Planet X five years ago is as easy for the public to access as this movie review. The scruffy-yet-capable Mal captaining a ship that seems to be held together with baling wire and paper clips tries to avoid a CIA-like government operative while dealing with a mysterious mind reader who leads him toward secrets the government doesnt want exposed. This universe includes no space aliens but the good guys also must fear the Reavers a cannibalistic clan of zombie-like humans who hunt in packs and rape and then kill their prey. For ""Serenity"" to succeed Whedon had to overcome even more obstacles than he faced three years ago. While ""Firefly"" was a high-budget TV show ""Serenity"" almost certainly cost less than the last Sandra Bullock comedy. Potential Problem No. 1 Arguably the movies biggest star Sarah Paulson arrives in the form of a hologram that lasts for a minute. The next most recognizable actors are the black detective from ""Barney Miller"" (Ron Glass) and the Baldwin who isnt one of Alecs brothers (Adam Baldwin as the ships muscle essentially returning to his ""My Bodyguard"" role). Potential Problem No. 2 You will see trick-or-treaters next month with more complicated costumes than the Reavers. Potential Problem No. 3 After receiving generally unfavorable reviews for ""Firefly"" Whedon brazenly revives many elements that got him criticized in the first place. Some of the Serenity crew still carry weapons that look as if they were made in the 19th century and almost everyone talks as if they were auditioning for ""Bonanza."" (""Kaylees been missin you sumpin fierce"" Fillion says and the syntax isnt supposed to be funny.) But its clear that this time Whedons new sugar daddies at Universal Pictures sat back and let him make the movie his way. And somehow it all comes together. The last half of the movie is particularly satisfying as Whedon repeatedly paints himself into corners and then writes his way out in a series of action sequences that just keep getting better. Choosing between his hard-core fans and mainstream audiences Whedon will always side with the geeks -- leaving Universal to bank on the fact that every computer techie in the country will see this movie five times on opening weekend. (Dont laugh. It might happen.) But he never insults his audience no matter who shows up in the theater. If ""Serenity"" isnt the next ""Matrix"" it will at the very least become this generations ""Highlander."" Mass audiences may ignore ""Serenity"" the way they did ""Firefly"" but the comic book convention crowd will still be hailing this film 30 years from now. -- Advisory This film contains violence gore and profanity. By watching high-quality geek filmmaking you run the risk of turning into a geek which can be very expensive. (Did you think video cards were cheap? And did you think Adam West just gives away his autograph?)

"Dont stress over originality -- at least `Serenity is fun - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Fans Dont stress over originality -- at least `Serenity is funmovies - reviewSeptember 30 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticOnce upon a time there was a sci-fi TV show that was canceled before its time.It hadnt been on very long. But its fans grew legion as years passed and the reruns indoctrinated millions of new recruits into its universe.And then it came back as a movie.But enough about Star Trek. Lets talk about Serenity.Its a movie built around a flop TV show that Fox didnt even keep for an entire season. Fifteen shows aired out of order and on nights that no one was watching. In 2002.Its ""fan"" wasnt legion.But that fan was its creator. And when his name is Joss Whedon who made Buffy a vampire slayer and whose name is synonymous with ""cult hit"" you give him another shot. Serenity is a kind of wrap-up movie for Firefly bringing back the cast to save the Earth off-colonies from ""the Alliance"" once and for all.Well once and for now. We wouldnt want to rule out sequels -- despite the number of folks from that cast killed off or at least wounded in the movie.Its vintage Whedon -- all jokey slangy dialogue mythic devil-may-care bravery and epic good-vs.-evil brawls.And theres not an original thought in it -- also vintage Whedon. Everything about Serenity from the design (Han Solo ""space rogue"" uniforms) to the plot (rebels vs. ""alliance"") feels cribbed from earlier sci-fi.But this is junk that goes down easy thanks to a glibber-than-glib script and a cast thats plainly in on the joke especially when they deliver zingers like these.""Know what the definition of `hero is? Its a guy who gets other people killed.""""Would you be killed in your sleep like an ailing pet?""Lets be bad guys.""""Half of writing history is hiding the truth""The story -- ex-rebel Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his reluctant crew (theres Gina Torres and youll recognize veteran Adam Baldwin as ""Jayne"") are robbing from the rich . . . and keeping it. When they can. They hang out on the raggedy edge of the civilized galaxy dodging government killers and ""reivers"" a version of the Living Dead that has somehow mastered space flight.Theyre smuggling this girl River (Summer Glau) a psychic with a Phoenix name and a Stevie Nicks wardrobe. She has escaped from the government and she knows its secrets. What R2D2 was too busy to hide the Death Stars plans this time?This erudite sword-wielding Anglo-African assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor of Four Brothers and Melinda and Melinda) will stop at nothing to recapture her. Again you couldnt book Darth Vader?Things blow up and bodies pile up as the crew of the starship Serenity fights to find out the psychics secrets and then to expose those secrets to a ""somnambulant public.""Theres your ""metaphor for modern society"" sci-fi fans. The sleeping drones need to awaken to the monstrous threat their government has become.And theres your slap in the face of Fox TV for killing off the show. The tagline for this movie? ""Cant stop the signal."" Universal gave Joss Whedon 40 million to dope slap Rupert Murdoch and his Republican politics. Hilarious.And actually it is. Originality aside this thing averages a laugh a minute as Fillion sort of an Americanized Sean Bean acts the heck out of this guy who supposedly doesnt care about anyone except himself.""Sure as I know anything I know this. I aim to misbehave.""Where was this guy when George Lucas was trying to remember what ""cool"" sounded like?Its formula stuff from the ""girl who dumped the hero"" to the Casablanca bar scene where the riffraff of the universe get drunk and fist fight to the achingly obvious efforts at inventing space-travel slang -- universe is ""verse"" atmosphere is ""atmo"" and picture-phone transmissions are ""waves.""But again its fun. It would make a cute TV show.Somebody call Rupert Murdoch.

Fillion Captain of the ship. Universal Pictures It is based on the short-lived Fox TV show Firefly which attracted a cult following and writer/director Joss Whedon squeezes out a few clever moments. But the characters are generally uninteresting and one-dimensional and the futuristic Western-style plot grows tedious. The story takes place 500 years in the future when Earth has been destroyed by a war and the solar system taken over by a fascist alliance. A group of scruffy-but-hot rebels aboard the spaceship Serenity takes on the legions of evil fascists. About the movie Serenity   (out of four) Stars Nathan Fillion Chiwetel Ejiofor Summer Glau Alan Tudyk Gina Torres Adam Baldwin Jewel Staite Director Joss Whedon Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense violence and action and some sexual references Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The frontier is planetary space. Much of the conflict centers on a psychic prodigy (Summer Glau) whom the bad guys want to exploit and the good guys have mixed feelings about because shes often more trouble than shes worth. As one member of the Serenity crew puts it shes ""a mite unpredictable."" But she can kick butt like nobodys business. The dialogue delivered mostly in Southern accents is intended to be funny and fresh but much of this Western-influenced sci-fi adventure story feels reheated. And lines like ""I aim to misbehave"" or ""I missed you something fierce"" just sound grating and forced. There is the occasional laugh when the drawl disappears and a contemporary sensibility takes hold. Someone tells a cohort knowingly ""Its not your way."" And the person asks ""I have a way?"" Still when films based on successful and beloved TV series have fallen flat over the years (like The Avengers or Twin Peaks) isnt it asking for trouble to make a movie version of a TV flop?

If youre not familiar with the crisp wit and ornery imagination of writer-creator Joss Whedons rusty-nail space Western -- no aliens no lightsabers just human society barely cohering on the retro-astro fringe -- your chances of appreciating this film are markedly lower though certainly not nil. Likely youll feel a pleasant bemusement akin to watching an excellent foreign film with a deliberately incomplete translation. Im hardly exaggerating The characters often lapse into a crisp quasi-frontiersy patois peppered with Chinese slang. (Let that settle in your head -- it works honest.) The first vision of the future to incorporate starships and suspenders Serenity (helmed by first-time feature director Whedon) embraces its space-Westernness with rich oaty literalism. The planet-hopping rust bucket of the title is home to a wagon train of untidy un?Star Trek misfits prowling the ""raggedy edge"" of a newly colonized solar system in search of extralegal employment. Their leader Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is a chipperly bitter veteran of a vast interplanetary civil war. (Consider him a 26th-century version of the romantically unreconstructed Reb.) Hes hiding a fugitive psychic River (Summer Glau) on the run from her Union er Alliance handlers. (Fans of Whedons Buffy the Vampire Slayer will recognize the damaged supergirl with childlike tics and godlike abilities.) River is pursued by a nameless government operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a self-described monster driven by a placid unshakable belief in the ""better world"" hes helping to nurture. The rest of the crew -- a true ensemble on the show -- are sadly pencil sketches here casualties of the two-hour running time. But each gets a ""moment"" that fans are free to unzip and decompress into a real character arc. The same goes for the story beats. Serenity despite its simple chase plot and elegant narrative ductwork is unmistakably a TV seasons worth of roller-coastering drama most of it balanced on the capable shoulders of Fillion a natural leading man. Jaw set but never stiff he gets both the Whedon wit and the Whedon grandiloquence between cheek and gum and gives the whole enterprise the heft of a real saga. Which it most certainly is -- especially for those who were already saddled up for the ride. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

The same could be said of this feature bow by writer-director Joss Whedon creator of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" as well as cult TV sci-fi oater ""Firefly"" of which current item is a bigscreen continuation. A correction was made to this review on Aug. 23 2005. ""I am a leaf on the wind Watch how I soar"" says one character in ""Serenity"" before being promptly made earthbound. The same could be said of this feature bow by writer-director Joss Whedon creator of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" as well as cult TV sci-fi oater ""Firefly"" of which current item is a bigscreen continuation. Quirky blend of Western elements high-end pulp philosophy decorative Orientalia old-style frontier dialogue and straight space shenanigans bounces around to sometimes memorable effect but rarely soars. Whedons sizable fan base will turn out in droves but this will need a hefty marketing push to post galactic returns. Following its world preem at the Edinburgh fest pic goes out wide Stateside Sept. 30 a potentially risky gambit for a cult-fueled venture that would benefit from more time to build beyond its card-carrying audience. Though the widescreen movie contains a reasonable amount of action sequences it was clearly made with considerably less coin than tentpole studio fare and still shows a TV-style aptitude for soundstage sequences separated by occasional exteriors. The Fox network axed ""Firefly"" in December 2002 after only 11 of the 14 completed episodes had aired. Series went on to immediate cult status on ancillary and most of the key actors reprise their roles here. Major addition to the cast is Brit thesp Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Amistad"" ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and upcoming ""Kinky Boots"") who darn near steals the movie as the good guys ruthless nemesis. Familiarity with the original episodes isnt necessary as a tight opening effectively recaps the backstory. Were 500 years in the future following a war in a newly colonized solar system that was won by a coalition called the Alliance; the losers the Independents roam the outer planets like frontier cowboys along with the Reavers thugs who eat their enemies live. In an interesting idea that largely lies undeveloped -- and has some contempo relevance in a globalized world -- the Independents hate the Alliance because the latter are ""in their homes in their heads (and) tell them what to think."" The Alliance is also inside one particular head -- that of River Tam (Summer Glau) a 17-year-old telepath whose brother Simon (Sean Maher) rescues her from Alliance boffins and security high-up the Operative (Ejiofor) in a pre-credits sequence thats one of the best in the picture. Tone lightens as the main story and cast show up. Simon was helped in his mission by Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion channeling a combo of Harrison Ford and the late Eric Fleming from ""Rawhide"") who heads the crew of Firefly-class spaceship Serenity a rusty-bucket transport vessel. Also on board are his deputy Zoe (Gina Torres) similarly dressed and holstered like a cowboy; Zoes husband Wash (Alan Tudyk) the crafts ace pilot; gruff gunslinger Jayne (Adam Baldwin in a good impression of Warren Oates); and corn-fed farm girl Kaylee (Jewel Staite) the ships mechanic. Main action sequence realized like a space-age stagecoach-and-Injuns chase comes early on as Mal amp; Co. pull off a payroll robbery on an outer planet and are disturbed by Reavers. Thereafter most of the action is confined to futuristic interiors -- handled OK but excepting a late-on mano a mano by River with no special atmosphere. Pics appeal lies in other areas from its mimicking of period stately Americana in the dialogue (Mal ""No more runnin; I aim to misbehave""; Jayne ""She is starting to damage my calm"") to the plot itself. Latter leads Mal amp; Co. via Rivers half-buried memories to an uncharted planet called Miranda wherein lies a terrible secret that the Alliance would like to remain buried. Hot on their tails at all times is the Operative plus assorted hungry Reavers. Oh and theres also Inara (Morena Baccarin) a professional ""companion"" for whom Mal still carries a torch. Nobody seems to have told Whedon that many U.S. sci-fiers were already Westerns in futuristic dress and that cross-cultural Eastern-Westerns were invented 40 years ago. What may have seemed fresh on network TV doesnt look quite so fresh on the bigscreen. Still what makes ""Serenity"" refreshing is its avoidance of CGI which gives the pic a much more human dimension; the evident chemistry between the cast; and a humor that doesnt rely simply on flip one-liners. None of these smarts however may be enough to satisfy mass auds. Fillion makes a commanding enough lead and is neatly backed up by a buff Torres as his femme sidekick especially in a hold-the-fort sequence that recalls Jenette Goldsteins character in ""Aliens."" Staite brings welcome fragility to the hard-assed crew as the tomboy mechanic and former ballerina Glau brings neat moves to her action moments. Sets look considerably airier than in the TV series though Whedon directs his interior sequences in a visually constricted way that shows his small-screen origins. Colors have a mostly dark unappetizing look that becomes a tad wearisome over two hours and David Newmans score does the business but never elevates the material.
