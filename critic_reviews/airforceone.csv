As President James Marshall the hero of the richly tense and satisfying new hijack thriller Air Force One (Columbia) Ford is the chief executive as red-blooded liberal superjock -- a Bill Clinton who served in Vietnam and has never waffled since. Standing before a diplomatic assembly in Moscow Marshall dripping with conviction gives a speech in which he commits America to crushing terrorists and dictators wherever they appear. ""We will no longer be afraid"" he says and then eyes narrowing a bit for the benefit of our enemies he adds ""Its your turn to be afraid."" Here at last is what America has yearned for in a leader the heart and mind of Franklin Delano Roosevelt joined with the cojones of Clint Eastwood. In addition to being a daredevil of empathy Marshall is also a really nice guy. After his speech he just wants to relax on Air Force One and watch a videotaped football game (assuming that is that he can keep his pesky staff from briefing him on who won) and to spend some quality cuddle time with his wife (Wendy Crewson) and 12-year-old daughter (Liesel Matthews). The plane itself is a marvelous contraption a two-tiered bunker jet secure enough to withstand the jolt of a nuclear blast yet infused with the honey gold lighting of a posh hotel bar. Its just as were settling in there that the movie hits us with a really big surprise. Do you think Im talking about a vicious terrorist attack? Well yes of course. (You were expecting Janet Reno?) The real shock however is that as the Russian nationalist fanatics who have smuggled themselves aboard leap up from their seats grab machine guns and begin to pump lead into the passengers its a genuinely unsettling dread-ridden moment. Air Force One presents Ford with his beautiful unforced gravity as the Daddy of Our Country and then rips him from the sanctum of American security -- Air Force One a kind of zoom-rocket White House. Its a place we dont want to see violated. The director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire) works with such clean swift precision that it takes a while to realize that hes cooking up another entry in the Die Hard-on-a-plane genre (Executive Decision Turbulence etc.). We all know the drill. A psychotic mastermind who takes the passengers hostage. A hero who hides in the planes bowels creeping about like a cat burglar as he picks off the terrorists one by one. The heros trusty comrade on the ground -- in this case Glenn Close as a charismatically starchy Vice President. What lends the old setups new vigor even passion is the slyly witty and inspiring spectacle of the chief executive as action renegade. In an era when politicians notably baby-boomer Leaders of the Free World have been mythologized as paragons of inaction Air Force One puts Marshalls line-in-the-sand resolve to a cruelly intimate test He says he wont negotiate with terrorists yet here they are holding a gun to his wife and daughter. The fate of Americas collective will is riding on how deftly Harrison Ford can use his wits and his fists. The movie has its bloody jolts its leaps into explosive James Bondish hyperbole (the moments in which Ford and company dangle off the end of the plane are truly scary) yet Petersen grounds it with scenes of disarming quiet and with the ferocious physical logic of his staging. The plot may be a comic book but you always know exactly where you are. Theres even a mini-constitutional crisis as Closes VP squares off against Dean Stockwells prim territorial defense secretary. Gary Oldman as the head villain an UberCommunist who despises Western freedom as if it were poison air does some real acting beneath the mugging. Sporting a goatee and a Volga-boatman accent he makes the sado-terrorist sweaty and desperate a life-size crazy who feels the fear of his victims and then kills them anyway. This is the rare summer thriller in which death actually stings. Though I dont know if Id go so far as to call Air Force One Hitchcockian the flair of Petersens direction is the way he seduces you into greater and greater flights of preposterousness. By the end even the pop patriotism is charged with conviction. Harrison Fords twisted-with-resolve heroic scowl lets you know that the President is fighting for two things at once himself and his country. The movies most irresistible fantasy is that it would never occur to him to draw a line between the two.

"Air Force One (R) Related Item Go to Video Finder Air Force One Pressurized Ride By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer July 25 1997 Director Wolfgang Petersen Cast Harrison Ford; Gary Oldman; Glenn Close; Wendy Crewson; Liesel Matthews; Paul Guilfoyle; Xander Berkeley; William H. Macy; Dean Stockwell; Tom Everett; Jurgen Prochnow Running Time 2 hours 5 minutes Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa This is the one into which Clinton should have had himself inserted ""Air Force One"" is a pulse-pounding bull goose of a movie but more than that its a 90 million endorsement of the Great Man theory of history. Its ""The Rough Riders"" set on a jetliner. Its president as action figure 6 feet 2 of heroic plastic. This prez kicks butt. He kills. He knows the operating drill on the Heckler amp; Koch MP5 machine pistol. He gives forthright speeches -- and this is really brave -- without clearing them with the staff first He puts the world on notice that America is back in the saddle again and theres a new sheriff in town. Harrison Ford in the role of this righteous galoot cant really be said to act because hes not really required to play a character. His President Jim Marshall lion of the free world Medal of Honor winner Big Ten grad football fan and beer drinker is so idealized he makes Barbies Ken look positively Dostoevskian. Ford does two things brilliantly He never bumps into the furniture and he never lets even a whisper of campy self-awareness crack the 100-foot-high Mount Rushmore of his face. ""Air Force One"" is set in an irony-free zone. Fords discipline is at its highest as he cleaves to the movies fundamental proposition This is not a joke. (It is of course.) Naturally hes the dullest thing in the movie. But thats not bad thats good. Who wants a neurotic intellectual or an ironist or a policy wonk at the helm when psychotic Russian nationalists have taken over the presidents plane on a flight back from Moscow and are busily executing hostages as a ploy to free a demonic nationalist leader recently filched from his despots den by a joint Spetznaz-Delta team (the movies fabulous opening sequence)? Much better this sort of leadership doubtless fearless dynamic clever aggressive anachronistic impossible and dull. But his dullness clears the way for the movies showiest special effect Gary Oldman. Oldman plays the evil Ivan Korshunov the terrorist who masterminds the skyjacking of Air Force One and then proceeds to steal not merely the gigantic flying machine itself but another and more important machine the camera. This actor is never so good as when he is very very bad and ""Air Force One"" provides him with a platform to do a variation on a combination of Boris Godunov and Boris Badenov simultaneously. Throw in some Rasputin and some Alexander Nevsky and even some Ivan Skavinsky Skavar and youve got the whole nine yards. He would eat the furniture if it werent all plastic and fiberglass. Director Wolfgang Petersen controls the mayhem with his usual extreme cleverness. Like everybody in the picture however hes working miles beneath his head. He once made a great movie about real men in a real war ""Das Boot"" but now hes making straw movies about straw men in a straw war. But you sense the intense level of his engagement. As in his last macho confabulation ""In the Line of Fire"" so much of the cleverness is in the details. In ""Fire"" I loved the way they solved the problem of getting not a ceramic gun but a brass and lead bullet through a metal detector by hiding it in a key chain which of course would go around the detector in a little plastic tray. In this one his micro-genius is on display in one sequence where he follows a bad MiG pilot engaging the presidents plane and then Air Force F-15s. The actor (Boris Krutonog) has maybe 25 seconds of total screen time the bottom of his face sealed off in an oxygen mask the top of his head capped in a plastic helmet. Whats left? Eyes. Fabulous bulging expressive eyes that radiate the raptors glee as he looses an air-to-air missile toward the big bird then utter fear of doom as he watches an F-15s Sidewinder come screaming to erase him in a bright orange blot. Cool movie death In fact one of the pleasant surprises of ""Air Force One"" is how much of it is an old-fashioned airplane movie. The modern computer morphing does no task better than rendering aircraft in flight. You never for a second tumble to the fact that you are watching electricity concocted by some arrogant kid in a Southern California computer shop The jets as they lace through the sky in and around the presidents plane are majestic and one sequence where a line of F-15s lets fly a phalanx of heat-seekers leaking flame as they streak across the sky has a terrible beauty to it. But in order to keep the odor of man-sweat testosterone and flatulence from becoming too terribly oppressive Petersen abetted by scriptwriter Andrew W. Marlowe (of Washington in fact) provides some female presence. Glenn Close is effectively steely as the vice president who manages to deal with a power play by the secretary of defense while coolly managing the war room crisis team. She cries only a little bit. Equally impressive is Wendy Crewson as the first lady. I love her sense of flintiness too She upbraids a staff member for not paying attention during a speech just like the real thing and she has a commanding presence that never breaks down even when the guns are pressed against her head. More idealized but also welcome is Liesel Matthews as the teenage first daughter. In all ""Air Force One"" is of a piece. It takes its absurd premise and keeps itself narrowly focused pushing its heroic cast through obstacle after obstacle. It lacks perhaps a moment of grief for the many warriors who sacrifice their lives for the chief exec and some of its gambits -- a parachute ""escape"" into where the Urals? -- play well on screen but fray upon application of minimum thoughtfulness. But its a great ride. Air Force One is rated R for extreme violence a high body count and occasional profanity.

"Air Force One (R) Related Item Go to Video Finder Air Force One Earns Its Wings By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer July 25 1997 Director Wolfgang Petersen Cast Harrison Ford; Gary Oldman; Glenn Close; Wendy Crewson; Liesel Matthews; Paul Guilfoyle; Xander Berkeley; William H. Macy; Dean Stockwell; Tom Everett; Jurgen Prochnow Running Time 2 hours 5 minutes Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa Harrison Ford makes such a dynamic president in ""Air Force One"" you may find yourself favorably weighing his odds in Iowa and New Hampshire. As President James Marshall hes one part bleeding heart two parts Sgt. Fury. A Medal of Honor winner this chief executive flew countless missions in Vietnam speaks his mind publicly (sending his national security adviser and handlers into a cowardly dither) cares about other nations loves his wife and daughter and -- most importantly for this kind of movie -- can roughhouse with the best of them. ""To those who use atrocity and terror"" declares the Chief Executive in a from-the-heart speech while traveling in Moscow ""your days are over."" This challenge is moments away from being tested. Not long after the President First Lady (Wendy Crewson) their daughter (12-year-old Liesel Natthews) and the entire Air Force One entourage board the plane communist radicals led by a man named Korshunov (Gary Oldman) take command of the aircraft. While the terrified passengers huddle at gunpoint and the White House contingent in Washington -- led by Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) -- attempts to negotiate Korshunov makes his demands known Release their leader General Alexander Radek (Juergen Prochnow) from Moscow jail or a hostage will be shot every half hour. Meanwhile Marshall hides in the hold playing cat-and-mouse with the terrorists calling the White House with his daughters cellular phone and orchestrating a full-scale rescue of his own airborne headquarters. On the most immediate visceral level -- which is all that most people ask of their summer movies -- ""Air Force One"" does exactly what its supposed to. It thrills you constantly allows you to vicariously kick commie-terrorist butt and gives you a guided tour through the innermost sanctum of American hegemony. One of the most anticipated releases of the summer its one of the few that truly fulfills expectations. With Ford at the helm these are the makings of a late summer landslide. The movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen is almost an inventory of hijack-thriller cliches. But the maker of ""Das Boot"" and ""In the Line of Fire"" is a master of suspense. He stokes you up until youre ready to explode whether its with tensely silent ordeals -- as Korshunov holds a gun to the head of the presidents daughter -- or screaming dogfights in the air when F-15s take on enemy MiGs with air-to-air missiles. At times the scenario (written by first-timer Andrew W. Marlowe) seems unsure of its balance between real suspense and goofy humor. Theres an almost childish Al-Haig power trip when the Defense Secretary (Dean Stockwell) attempts to wrest controls of the White House from Vice President Bennett. And while the world awaits the outcome of this hostage crisis the president is forced to consult a manual so he can figure out his daughters phone. But these moments of silliness are more than balanced by Petersens extraordinary ability to keep this movie flight-worthy Fords almost-executive presence and an outstanding performance from Oldman. Keeping his character from turning into another raving gun-toting lunatic he makes Korshunov disturbingly human with a persuasive Russian accent and a sense of sweaty controlled conviction. In the end this powerful opposition to President Marshall -- and the American ideals he stands for -- gives the film greater dimension. It makes victory over the bad guys that much sweeter. AIR FORCE ONE (R)  Contains profanity and in-flight executions.

Spiked by some spectacularly staged and genuinely tense action sequences Wolfgang Petersens latest politically tinged thriller will soar on Harrison Fords name to high-flying domestic and international grosses scoring another summer hit for Sony. Seeing the president of the United States as a kick-butt action hero pretty much sums up the appeal of ""Air Force One"" a preposterously pulpy but quite entertaining suspense meller. Spiked by some spectacularly staged and genuinely tense action sequences Wolfgang Petersens latest politically tinged thriller will soar on Harrison Fords name to high-flying domestic and international grosses scoring another summer hit for Sony. Despite its cartoon-like delineation of the forces of good and evil its dependence upon special visual effects for much of its excitement and the piling on of an excess of climaxes this tale of the hijacking of the worlds most security-laden airplane nonetheless comes off as far more ""realistic"" than the majority of this summers big-budget attractions simply because everything in it is meant to be physically possible in the real world rather than being rooted in the credibility of the effects themselves. Viewers looking for old-fashioned movie thrills as a change of pace from the glut of alien and digital-oriented features might paradoxically enjoy the feeling of being back on terra firma with this airborne adventure. The search for plausible movie villains in the post-Cold War era this time leads to Kazakhstan where a prologue shows a Yank-Russian commando raid snaring fascistic leader Gen. Radek (""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow in a silent cameo). At a subsequent celebratory dinner in Moscow U.S. President James Marshall (Ford) soberly announces that in the future his country will never give in to or negotiate with terrorists putting such evildoers on notice that their days are numbered. But no sooner has Air Force One taken off for the trip home than it is taken over by a bunch of Radek faithful led by the fanatical Ivan (Gary Oldman) who blames the U.S. for the destruction of his country and is determined that Mother Russia be restored to its former glory. Having gotten on board posing as journalists with the unexplained help of a member of the presidents security staff the gang is able to commandeer the planes artillery and mow down quite a few passengers before securing control of the plane. Ivans plan to take the president hostage is thwarted when the latter seems to escape in a space capsule-like emergency pod from the bottom of the fuselage (one of the films inventions apparently). The pilots urgent attempt to land the 747 at a German airbase -- only to be shot and replaced at the controls by one of the terrorists who desperately tries to lift the giant plane off the tarmac after it has set down -- makes for a terrific action set piece that can genuinely be called nerve-wracking. Once cruising altitude has been regained contact is made with Washington and Ivan announces his intentions He will execute a hostage from among the many government staff on board every half-hour until Radek is released from prison. This results in a good deal of intercutting between the plane and the capital where Vice President Bennett (Glenn Close) who has no idea where the president might be must try to make monumental decisions while being pulled in different directions by the Haig-like secretary of defense (Dean Stockwell) the joint chiefs and others among the power elite. President Marshall however -- Vietnam vet and Medal of Honor winner that he is -- has not jumped ship but has become a guerrilla fighter on board his own aircraft. Amusingly playing peekaboo with the thugs in the hold the president succeeds in drawing one of them into a fight and presto emerges from it as a full-fledged action hero after he kills him. For quite a while Marshall manages to keep his presence down below a secret from his adversaries even as he manages to establish phone contact with the outside to order F-15s to fire missiles at his own plane to kill another terrorist and to dump a great deal of fuel in an effort to effect a quick resolution. Second boffo action sequence involves dozens of passengers parachuting out of the planes belly during an attempted refueling which results in a stunning fiery explosion and the sight of the U.S. president barely hanging on to the jet as it flies at 15000 feet. At long last however Ivan gets his intended prey in his grips; despite Marshalls tough words he must eventually accede to his captors demand to release Radek setting in motion an international incident that parallels the final battle between the two enemies in the air. Unfortunately ""Air Force One"" shares with many of its other summer-release companions the sin of excess endings; after delivering its natural climax the filmmakers insist upon adding a few more including a final one involving the renegade Secret Service agent that is downright silly. The artificiality of the material and the hokiness of many individual moments notwithstanding Petersen the master of cramped quarters in ""Das Boot"" puts it all across with relative conviction and great vigor. All the key scenes whether they involve massive logistics or one-on-one personal confrontations are shot and edited to pulse-quickening effect which casts into shadow the numerous possible objections one can easily raise to the film that it is a wildly jingoistic American imperialist exercise a more covert ""Rambo""-like fantasy projection for Vietnam-era men or that first-time screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowes admittedly clever scenario could have sorely used some leavening wit and humor. The film succeeds even despite what can only be called a monotone physically unexciting performance from Ford. His relatively withdrawn reluctant personality adds little dimension to the drama and yet he somehow fills the bill both as a president and a man who can take difficult matters into his own hands and bend them to his will. There is definite star power at work here along with a talent for making less seem like a lot more. Oldman in his second malevolent lead of the summer after ""The Fifth Element"" registers strongly as a veteran of the Afghan campaign pushed to desperate lengths to newly ennoble his country. Close spends most of her time speaking urgently over the phone and other members of the large supporting cast deliver well-delineated cut-outs. Films many outstanding technical achievements do not overshadow the dramatic tension of the situations themselves. Huge visual effects team supervised by Richard Edlund deserves major kudos for the bounty of startling in-flight incidents. Production designer William Sandell oversaw the re-creation of Air Force One the interior of which provides much ongoing fascination and such incidental sets as the crowded Moscow banquet room and Radeks circles-of-hell prison are marvelous. Michael Ballhaus highly mobile lensing and Richard Francis-Bruces adroit editing contribute strongly to keeping the film aloft. Jerry Goldsmiths score seems overstrenuous at times in trying to stir extra excitement.

As President James Marshall the hero of the richly tense and satisfying new hijack thriller Air Force One (Columbia) Ford is the chief executive as red-blooded liberal superjock -- a Bill Clinton who served in Vietnam and has never waffled since. Standing before a diplomatic assembly in Moscow Marshall dripping with conviction gives a speech in which he commits America to crushing terrorists and dictators wherever they appear. ""We will no longer be afraid"" he says and then eyes narrowing a bit for the benefit of our enemies he adds ""Its your turn to be afraid."" Here at last is what America has yearned for in a leader the heart and mind of Franklin Delano Roosevelt joined with the cojones of Clint Eastwood. In addition to being a daredevil of empathy Marshall is also a really nice guy. After his speech he just wants to relax on Air Force One and watch a videotaped football game (assuming that is that he can keep his pesky staff from briefing him on who won) and to spend some quality cuddle time with his wife (Wendy Crewson) and 12-year-old daughter (Liesel Matthews). The plane itself is a marvelous contraption a two-tiered bunker jet secure enough to withstand the jolt of a nuclear blast yet infused with the honey gold lighting of a posh hotel bar. Its just as were settling in there that the movie hits us with a really big surprise. Do you think Im talking about a vicious terrorist attack? Well yes of course. (You were expecting Janet Reno?) The real shock however is that as the Russian nationalist fanatics who have smuggled themselves aboard leap up from their seats grab machine guns and begin to pump lead into the passengers its a genuinely unsettling dread-ridden moment. Air Force One presents Ford with his beautiful unforced gravity as the Daddy of Our Country and then rips him from the sanctum of American security -- Air Force One a kind of zoom-rocket White House. Its a place we dont want to see violated. The director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire) works with such clean swift precision that it takes a while to realize that hes cooking up another entry in the Die Hard-on-a-plane genre (Executive Decision Turbulence etc.). We all know the drill. A psychotic mastermind who takes the passengers hostage. A hero who hides in the planes bowels creeping about like a cat burglar as he picks off the terrorists one by one. The heros trusty comrade on the ground -- in this case Glenn Close as a charismatically starchy Vice President. What lends the old setups new vigor even passion is the slyly witty and inspiring spectacle of the chief executive as action renegade. In an era when politicians notably baby-boomer Leaders of the Free World have been mythologized as paragons of inaction Air Force One puts Marshalls line-in-the-sand resolve to a cruelly intimate test He says he wont negotiate with terrorists yet here they are holding a gun to his wife and daughter. The fate of Americas collective will is riding on how deftly Harrison Ford can use his wits and his fists. The movie has its bloody jolts its leaps into explosive James Bondish hyperbole (the moments in which Ford and company dangle off the end of the plane are truly scary) yet Petersen grounds it with scenes of disarming quiet and with the ferocious physical logic of his staging. The plot may be a comic book but you always know exactly where you are. Theres even a mini-constitutional crisis as Closes VP squares off against Dean Stockwells prim territorial defense secretary. Gary Oldman as the head villain an UberCommunist who despises Western freedom as if it were poison air does some real acting beneath the mugging. Sporting a goatee and a Volga-boatman accent he makes the sado-terrorist sweaty and desperate a life-size crazy who feels the fear of his victims and then kills them anyway. This is the rare summer thriller in which death actually stings. Though I dont know if Id go so far as to call Air Force One Hitchcockian the flair of Petersens direction is the way he seduces you into greater and greater flights of preposterousness. By the end even the pop patriotism is charged with conviction. Harrison Fords twisted-with-resolve heroic scowl lets you know that the President is fighting for two things at once himself and his country. The movies most irresistible fantasy is that it would never occur to him to draw a line between the two.
