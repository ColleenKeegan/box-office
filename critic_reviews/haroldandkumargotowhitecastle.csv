Harold (John Cho) is an efficient Korean-born finance rep whos often left to pick up the pieces of his xenophobic work-shy colleagues; his best mate Kumar (Kal Penn) a promising Indian medical student constantly ribbed by the local dunderhead gang is supposed to be readying himself for a series of career interviews but quite frankly hed rather just get stoned. And what pleases Kumar pleases Harold. During a toking session the pair spy a TV ad for a well-known US fast-food joint that spurs them into an overnight burger quest that proceeds to spiral ridiculously and hilariously out of control. The film comes with at least half-a-dozen side-splitting scenes yet behind all the Farrelly-esque gross-out humour and Cheech amp; Chong-isms lies a sensitive little picture with a deftly handled anti-racism slant. Credit too to the congenial leads (especially Penn) who have their indomitable characters down to a T.

"Harold amp; Kumar aims low but achieves a high - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Harold amp; Kumar aims low but achieves a high By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 30 2004 The Harold (John Cho) in ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" is an uptight Korean-American investment banker. Kumar (Kal Penn) his Indian-American roommate is an epic slacker whos obviously smart but would do anything to avoid applying to med school. By ""anything"" I mean get stoned which he and Harold apparently do a lot. When we drop in on them getting high a TV ad for White Castle seduces them into the car -- the announcer talks about the mini-burgers using the porned-up breathiness of certain 976 ads.When they cant find a White Castle in their New Brunswick N.J. neighborhood a simple jaunt for slyders stretches into a Garden State odyssey that ends up capturing the feeling of being bored and nonwhite in New Jersey. Silliness is the movies only ambition but theres something mind-blowing about seeing a fratty comedy through two pairs of Asian-American eyes particularly when those eyes belong to actors who were token minorities in other dumb comedies Cho in ""American Pie"" and Penn in ""Van Wilder.""To the best of my knowledge Harold and Kumar are the first Asian-Americans to carry a widely marketed US movie -- a fact that elevates this grubby little flick to event status. This despite neither guy adequately sticking up for any of the other humiliated minorities in this movie.""Harold amp; Kumar"" was lackadaisically directed by Danny Leiner who also guided Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott from mishap to mishap in 2000s ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" That movie has clearly spawned this one -- two stoners on a surreal journey -- and both are ""stoopid"" comedies albeit disingenuously so Theyre knowingly inane.Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg two 26-year-old first-timers wrote the screenplay and what they lack in Asian cultural authority -- their presumable stand-ins arent Harold and Kumar but the pair of bong-hitting Jews down the hall -- they make up for in brand-name marketing savvy. White Castle is the movies Oz so the tie-in is beyond egregious but the road-movie search is quaint.Yet like every misbehaving frat-minded comedy since ""American Pie"" ""Harold amp; Kumar"" has an undercurrent of homosexual panic. Theres a band of extreme sports-loving rednecks who swear H and K are boyfriends and one nightmare scenario offers an unfulfilled orgy with a mechanic (Christopher Meloni) whose face and neck are covered in boils. Still our heroes leap into a full-throttle car-radio sing-along to Wilson Phillips ""Hold On"" might be the gayest scene of the year.Cho has a sharply withdrawn comic style. His Harold is so pent-up that Chos whack at a primal scream sometime after the actor Neil Patrick Harris playing himself high on Ecstasy steals his car feels cathartic. He and Penn are very good together occupying the void between Cheech and Chong and Oscar and Felix. Penns Kumar could become Jeff Spicoli for the generation of college kids whove never seen ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" but always seem to have a copy of ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" cued up at a moments notice.At one point in the movie Harold and Kumar wind up at Princeton where Kumar tries scoring girls and pot while Harold is buttonholed by a perky girl (Siu Ta). She runs the East Asian club whose members are wildly obsessed with his investment banking experiences yet have a healthy enough wild side to throw a raging kegger. A new universe of university life feels up for the skewering.This is one of the only movies to reflect certain absurd realities of college life in an era of multiculturalism and affirmative action No matter how much things change kids will still want to rip off their shirts and swing them around while dancing on a table. Stoners and party animals are creatures that know no color.

Let us not forget the Cheech and Chong flicks which featured a Mexican and a Chinese in their perpetual quest to stay high. So perhaps its best to say the frequently hilarious ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" brings multiculturalism back to the bong circle. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.printarticle/weekly/weekend;dir=weekendnode;dir=print;dir=weekly;dir=weekend;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1091190179875?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.printarticle/weekly/weekend;dir=weekendnode;dir=print;dir=weekly;dir=weekend;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1091190179875?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.printarticle/weekly/weekend;dir=weekendnode;dir=print;dir=weekly;dir=weekend;page=article;kw=;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1091190179876?""></a> After all the ""dudes"" in this movie are Harold (John Cho) a twenty-something Korean American investment banker and his roommate-pal Kumar (Kal Penn) an Indian American med school student who is assured a lucrative career if hed only accept his family-arranged destiny. Culturally theyre single American couch potatoes just like millions of others in their twenties. And they like to smoke it up. But these two know the double-standard deal. People assume things about them. Some make fun of Kumars accent. Being a stoner can have its problems. After a serious case of the munchies the friends find themselves with a craving for one thing and one thing only the buy-em-by-the-bag cheeseburgers of White Castle. No other fast food will do. They take off on a quest that proves in its charmingly dumb way to be mythic. ""No matter what"" says Kumar ""we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs."" First setback The White Castle they had in mind is closed. Now its a Burger Shack. Not the same thing. Harold and Kumar then make the fateful decision to drive to the next White Castle location some 45 miles away. Their trip to the White Castle restaurant becomes a Holy Grail mission on the Jersey Turnpike a journey of unexpected mysteries including an ill-fated diversion to Princeton University (which could provoke an even bigger surge in college applications this year) scary animals (crazed raccoon in the car and omigod is that a cheetah?) out-there encounters with racist cops a gang of bigoted dudes at a convenience store and a phantom redneck with oozy boils on his face who insists they sleep with his gorgeous wife. Along the way they also pick up hitchhiker Neil Patrick Harris (playing himself) the onetime star of ""Doogie Howser M.D."" whos clearly zoned out on something. He proves to be an alarmingly scary passenger. Let it not go unsaid that ""Harold amp; Kumar"" doesnt hesitate to uh plunge into toilet humor. But hey as long as youre in the bathroom you might as well be funny. Screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are amusingly inventive about anything from this crude business to the crazy animal stunts. Director Danny Leiner (who actually directed ""Dude Wheres My Car?"") has made a peppy satisfying comedy that could soon become a minor classic. And by the time our red-eyed heroes find the elusive White Castle -- which you know they eventually must -- their satisfaction feels as powerful as any food-eating Ive seen on screen.

"Harold and Kumar A Real Bud Movie washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Harold and Kumar A Real Bud Movie Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 30 2004 You might look for castles in Spain but . . . New Jersey? Well it makes some sense at least if the modifier ""White"" precedes ""Castle"" in which case we know were talking about the famous fast-food joint that serves baby burgers called ""sliders"" in lil boxes that by reputation taste best after an evening spent sucking down giggle-weed gas. That experience hallowed in some precincts hated in others is commemorated in ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" which will seem a classic if youre stoned and only slightly less funny if youre straight. Harold (John Cho) a low-ranking investment banker and Kumar (Kal Penn) a refugee from medical school are smart funny and desperate. Though the Manhattan roommates are in their twenties the world of women in specific and adulthood in general remains largely mysterious to them. Each seems to be segueing toward someone elses idea of what their lives should be Harold will marry an earnest Korean girl he does not love and Kumar will obey his fathers dictates and become the doctor he does not want to become. But tonight . . . tonight tonight wont be just any night tonight there will be no morning star theyll see their love tonight. The problem is that their love isnt a Maria (though Harold dreams of a Maria) but a Cherry Hill slider outlet. Can it be that the Indiana ditchweed the Assassin of Youth the moocah the Belyando spruce the bammy the wacky terbacky has addled their brains? Are they suffering from blue munchies the size of Louisiana and only greasy postage-stamp-size burgers prettied up with onions and served on a steamed dinner-roll bun the consistency of pudding will satisfy? Well yes. And that is what happens. They head to Jersey in search of the 24/7 freedom and zest of a rumored White Castle somewhere north of Princeton but south of Hoboken running into one misadventure after another and one stereotype after another. Its one of those bad-trip movies where the longer the travelers travel the farther they get from their destination. Each turn is a wrong turn each decision a wrong decision. And that includes the decision to pick up a hitchhiker who turns out to be Doogie Howser M.D. (Neil Patrick Harris in a good-sport cameo). The movie directed by Danny Leiner thrives on the comfort that Cho and Penn have with each other how perfectly they mesh and how endearing Harold and Kumar are as they approach the bliss of which there is no match when you burp and itch White Castles scratch. Harold is so repressed hes a patsy for work bullies and a tongue-tied idiot when he finds himself alone in an elevator with the girl of his dreams. Kumar meanwhile lives off his dad while secretly subverting all the med school entrance interviews (the one he has with Fred Willard in the beginning is hysterical.) It isnt great but what do you expect from the director of ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" The movie is easily the fifth or maybe even the fourth best ever shot in New Jersey. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (87 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for drug and sex humor sexual situations profanity excessive drug usage crimes against humanity and bad taste in fast food.

Yes its true People get mighty passionate about those tasty teensy burgers -- a funny hook that ultimately isnt enough to carry Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. (Related story Cho and Penn go to Pop Burger) Belly bombers are the ultimate goal of Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. Movies have probably been built on shakier grounds. New Line Productions This is because only occasionally does the movie offer a whole lot beyond a hook as we watch its two stoners (John Cho as Korean Harold and Kal Penn as Indian Kumar) spend eight or so hours in Princeton and sundry underbellies of New Jersey. Their increasingly elusive goal to locate the nearest culinary mecca offering those tough to resist burgers even if they do for car upholstery aromas about what they do for your breath. Part of the pictures problem is that neither actor is anything more than an adequate comic lead -- though both of course have the right ethnic makeup to serve a comedy bent on inverting racial stereotypes. Worse a disproportionate number of gags rely on crude encounters including a flatulence contest in a womens restroom and a wart-ridden religious fanatics babe wife who craves group sex. This is one more ""youth movie"" thatll put years on anyone over 25. ABOUT THE MOVIE Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle   1/2 (out of four) Stars John Cho Kal Penn Paula Garces Neil Patrick Harris Fred Willard Director Danny Leiner Distributor New Line Cinema Rating R for strong language sexual content drug use and some crude humor. Opens Friday nationwide Here and there though it amuses. The great Fred Willard plays a med school dean and an extended Neil Patrick Harris cameo gives us what sounds like the title of a really bad concept album the libidinous side of Doogie Howser. The recent model for this kind of surreal jazz-riff comedy is Doug Limans 1999 Go a neo-classic. But you know already from the director (Dude Wheres My Car?s Danny Leiner) if this movie is for you. Leiner has cornered the recent market on low-rent farces.

Starring John Cho Kal Penn. Directed by Danny Leiner. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. (R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In their 1970s haze Cheech and Chong didnt know they were inventing a whole subgenre of film the stoner adventure comedy. Of course an adventure for those guys was getting off the couch. In the years since marijuana has become more potent and onscreen tokers -- Snoop Dogg  Jay and Silent Bob the ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" dudes -- have raised the cinematic stakes offering mind-bending exploits for bong-friendly viewers. ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" from ""Dude"" director Danny Leiner has enough laughs and misadventures to satisfy its built-in audience but it wont win any converts. Apart from the welcome casting of two talented young Asian American actors (John Cho and Kal Penn) as leads instead of sidekicks ""Harold"" is pretty standard stuff mixing a few truly clever moments with facile drug humor and throwaway female characters. Cho (""American Pie"" ""Better Luck Tomorrow"") downplays his good looks to play Harold a slightly repressed workhorse investment banker and half this movies stoner duo. Harold imagines a witty conversation with an attractive neighbor (Paula Garces) but hes dumbstruck when they share an elevator ride -- and this is before hes stoned. Hes also a worrier frustrated by the situations his roommate Kumar foists upon him. How someone can be so anal and also a total pothead is a matter of behavioral complexity beyond this movies reach. Penn (""National Lampoons Van Wilder"") portrays Kumar as a smart charming screw-up. Blessed with supreme confidence this guy can talk anyone into anything. He interrupts a medical-school interview for a cell phone conversation -- within earshot of the interviewer -- in which he prods Harold to leave work to come home and get baked. Their subsequent munchies- fueled quest for White Castle burgers traverses the New Jersey Turnpike and back roads a stay in jail a stint in a hospital operating room and a special- effects-enhanced encounter with a wayward zoo animal. The script by newcomers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg is maddeningly inconsistent. A bit where Kumar imagines what he would do with a giant bag of weed is simply sublime and reason enough to see the movie. But other jokes are beyond lame. The guys Jewish stoner pals (whom Kumar and Harold refer to as ""Man"" and ""Schewitz"") marvel at having seen actress Katie Holmes breasts in a movie. ""You know the Holocaust?"" one asks. ""Well it was the opposite of that."" The ethnic jokes are supposed to be less offensive because everybody is making them. But women arent given equal footing. They are mostly here to be sexually pliant like the comely wife of a boil-infested tow truck driver who offers herself to the boys. The only female characters resembling real women are Garces character who barely speaks and a pretty smart Princeton student (Siu Ta) who likes Harold. He rejects her as being too stereotypically Asian. Apparently this means she cares about her studies and is unwilling to show her breasts upon first meeting. The movie is filled with celebrity cameos from teen-movie stalwarts like Anthony Anderson and Jamie Kennedy but only one really hits the mark. Neil Patrick Harris from ""Doogie Howser M.D."" is a riot as himself. Tripping on ecstasy Harris expresses a very un-""Doogie"" like desire to find some strippers and get busy. As a hedonist he puts Harold and Kumar to shame. -- Advisory This film contains drug use nudity profanity sexual situations and trans fat.

They say ""dude"" a lot and theyre perpetually on the prowl for great weed and rockin babes. The movie however has a terrific twist and the characters overt ethnicity is only part of it. Harold (John Cho) an investment banker of Korean descent and Kumar (Kal Penn) whose Indian family is desperate for him to go to medical school share a quality the overgrown adolescents in films like this are never allowed to possess Theyre witty focused and highly aware. They make having a brain look hip. Out to score some dope in their native New Jersey they stop off at Princeton attending a meeting of the Asian student club and the hilarious scene that follows is a perfect example of how the movie exploits cultural stereotypes only to transcend them. The bookish losers in the room may be rude caricatures but theyre a joke as well to the stoically acerbic Harold. His attitude is Get over the geekiness folks - join the party. Kumar is even more ebullient in his hostility and Kal Penn plays him with a motormouth as assaultive as Howard Sterns. Directed by Danny Leiner (""Dude Wheres My Car?"") ""Harold amp; Kumar"" takes place over one picaresque all-night-long road trip in which the two stoners search for a White Castle to douse their craving for those luscious little oniony burgers. Their adventures range from the gross (a defecation contest between college girls) to the porno-surreal (a mock horror-film encounter with a boil-laced monstrosity named Freakshow and his nubile wife). They also run into a band of racist punks who look at Harold and Kumar and see a couple of outsiders. The punks couldnt be more wrong. In its defiantly lowbrow way ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" celebrates the pursuit of pleasure as the grand unifier of America with everyone in the melting pot fused in burger heaven.

Pics cult potential will translate into tasty theatrical returns and awesome vid scarfing sessions. Pic also promises seconds in the form of a sequel. Picking up the banner from Cheech and Chong for a new generation of stoner dudes ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" gleefully upends expectations and delivers an energetic comedy tracing two guysall-night search for the perfect White Castle burger. What could have just pushed the usual youth comedy buttons is instead a crafty spoof on issues from racial politics to American highway monoculture that belies its cover (and marketing) as only a dumb gross-out laffer. Pics cult potential will translate into tasty theatrical returns and awesome vid scarfing sessions. Pic also promises seconds in the form of a sequel. Although the title might be off-putting to those critical of Hollywoods yen for product placement odyssey is stuffed with hazards that completely distract from the lusted-after product. A better indicator of pics true nature is the assured directorial presence of ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" helmer Danny Leiner who has now at least equaled that cult hits laugh quotient. Exploited as the reliably workaholic Asian -- specifically Korean -- office pushover by his superiors Harold Lee (John Cho) unhappily puts up with his corporate fate and cant find the right words to say to Maria (Paula Garces) a cute gal neighbor in his building. By contrast his roommate Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) shows a more rebellious and assertive nature when interviewing with an overly ingratiating med school dean (Fred Willard briefly on screen but in classic mode). Though his Indian parents expect the intelligent Kumar to become a doctor just like his older brother and father hed rather kick back and light up a nice fat doobie. During a nighttime pot-drenched couch potato session Harold and Kumar get a serious case of the munchies and want ""the perfect food."" On cue a White Castle burger ad appears on the tube triggering the goofiest case of consumer demand the movies have shown in some time. Kal mistakenly thinks he knows where a White Castle is nearby in their corner of New Jersey but a series of mishaps -- including toll booth flubs and an unintended detour into a bad section of Newark -- land the guys in Princeton. At the university Kumar tries to score some more pot from an ersatz ""hippie"" connection while Harold finds himself lured into a hilarious Asian American students association meeting. Its already obvious that Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossbergs script is going to be a fairly mad study in placing obstacles in their heroes way. Leiner lays out the obstacle course by smoothly pacing and moving this hungry pair from station to station as they scramble around the state. Several incidents lay the groundwork for an eventual payoff but the best bits are pure gonzo moviemaking such as a run-in with the worlds ugliest auto mechanic aptly nicknamed ""Freakshow"" (a thoroughly unrecognizable Christopher Meloni) and an interlude in a college womens bathroom where coeds are in a flatulence competition. Twists and turns in this and a subsequent episode where Harold and Kumar pick up a hitchhiking Neil Patrick Harris (as a hornier version of himself) have all the earmarks of storytelling drenched in cannabis smoke -- which is just as it should be. Cho and Penn are an absolutely perfect duo of clowns suited for the young smart set. After his regular turn in the ""American Pie"" series and as a modern conflicted student in ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" Cho blends parts of both these roles into Harold and stands as a winning charismatic Asian American thesp with real star appeal. Penn is more naturally silly than Cho but he never upstages his partner while showing brief glimpses of a more serious Kumar under the surface. Support by a range of actors coming from wildly differing schools of comedy (Willard Harris Garces Meloni as well as David Krumholtz and Eddie Kaye Thomas as H amp; Ks overtly identified Jewish neighbors) work well. Pics colorblind play on race and stereotypes embraces Korean and Indian buddies but also an anti-political correctness. Bruce Douglas Johnson has a lot of fun lensing in various nocturnal looks and settings and joins production designer Steve Rosenzweig for a broad colorful look. Visual effects are on the suitably cheapo side while music cues dial up ultra-contempo sounds.
