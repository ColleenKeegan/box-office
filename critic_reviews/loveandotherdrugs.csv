Comments (1) Love and Other Drugs Rated R  113 minutes  2010 Eight months after health-care reform was signed into law 20th Century Fox courageously weighs in with a watered-down satire of the pharmaceutical industry adapted from Jamie Reidys 2005 memoir Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. Jake Gyllenhaal is a slimy sales rep for Pfizer whose already bulging wallet fattens exponentially after his company debuts its magic erection pill; Anne Hathaway is his love interest a poor artist getting even poorer as she tries to pay for treatment of her early-onset Parkinsons. Their heavy-humping romance dominates the movie allowing for liberal doses of snickering sex comedy and disease-of-the-week schmaltz. Screenwriters Edward Zwick Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz make just enough of a nod to the deforming power of Big Pharma to now expect credit for having tackled the issue. I guess there are some limp dicks no pill can cure. Zwick directed; with Oliver Platt Hank Azaria and Josh Gad. By J.R.

We first meet him when hes a sales assistant using amateur psychology to woo pretty customers. Fired for sleeping with the bosss girlfriend Jamie discovers the perfect outlet for his cheerful charm pharmaceutical sales. Taking a trainee job as a rep for Pfizer Jamie doorsteps doctors and seduces receptionists in an attempt to sell his wares. First hes flogging Zoloft but when Viagras possibilities as a sex drug emerge hes first in line to push it - and his popularity soars.Inspired by former rep Jamie Reidys book Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman the film takes an entertaining breezily cynical look at the tricks of the pharmaceutical trade. But thats the drugs stuff - what of love? The tone shifts after Jamie meets commitment-shy artist Maggie (Anne Hathaway). At first they banter and bed each other (a lot). Then Jamie starts to question his lifestyle; the L-word is mentioned. Oh and she has early-onset Parkinsons disease. And so it morphs from macho career comedy into sexy romcom-turned-romantic weepie. Its like two or three films stapled together - imagine channel-hopping between Wall Street Pretty Woman and Sweet November. Editing choices are perplexing subplots and characters appear forgotten then hastily revisited out of context. Love and Other Drugs is not an unpleasant experience - it has charming leads and a fitfully witty script. It also shows you more of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway than youve seen before should that be of interest. But it has so much going on it fails to develop any of its strands satisfactorily. Ultimately the unsettled tone undermines the romantic conclusion. Still youve got to admire the ambition it shares with its cocky hero. Not many films would follow a Parkinsons convention with a Viagra-fuelled sex party.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If youre a sucker for a winning smile the stars of the dramatic comedy romance ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" may have you before ""hello."" Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have knockout smiles that well serve their characters Jamie Randall and Maggie Murdock. And the pair have toothsome chemistry in the story of a Viagra drug salesman and the woman who recognizes the huckster he is -- because she knows how to sell a bill of goods too. Jamie is the underachieving son in a family that has two doctors and an geeky Internet millionaire (played by Josh Gad with a slightly asthmatic delivery). The late Jill Clayburgh appears as their mom. We know little of Maggies family history. Its her present and future that give the story its truer grit. She is an artist. She is vivacious. She is also in the early stages of Parkinsons disease. Early on its clear its going to be fun -- and maybe a bit wrenching -- to watch these two fall for each other hard. And director/co-writer Edward Zwick knows it. ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is loosely based on Jamie Reidys memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" about being a drug rep for the little blue blockbuster that made the warning ""seek immediate medical treatment if you experience an erection lasting more than four hours"" all too well known. And theres plenty here about how Big Pharma operates the glad- handing or stalking of doctors the push to get market leverage. When Jamie finds his calling with Pfizer he initially has to compete with the regions No. 1 antidepressant sales rep. Hes got Zoloft. Trey (Gabriel Macht) coasts into offices and doctors listen to his Prozac pitches. Hank Azaria portrays Dr. Stan Knight their prize. If youve read articles about companies hiring former cheerleaders to be field reps Dr. Knights the reason. Oliver Platt is likably worn as Jamies boss. Zwick has often taken seriously the ""big"" in big screen delivering dramas like ""Glory"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond."" In 2008 he made the Holocaust drama ""Defiance."" Hes doesnt shy away from the heavy-laden. But in ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" the movie and TV director and his partner in fine television craftsmanship Marshall Herskovitz (""thirtysomething"" ""Once and Again"") find a groove that delivers wry writing and smart cultural observation. (Charles Randolph also co-wrote.) Aptly the film has the feel of a pleasing come-on. Steven Rosenblums editing is swift assured. Back in 2005 Hathaway and Gyllenhaal showed they could play energetically off each other when they were cast as a closeted gay husband and a cowgirl- savvy wife in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Their pairing here is less culturally encumbered than Ang Lees film -- at least on the surface. But theres heft surfing beneath. And for viewers who take the plunge there are timely notions about health and illness sex and death -- or more frightening to some disability. That said ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is surprisingly frank and frisky with the couples sex scenes and sweet with their lovemaking. Its rated R. The script mirrors the attitudes of its protagonists. Impossibly foxy 20-somethings they seem sex-positive. Although perhaps not for entirely solid reasons. The films linchpin scenes come when Maggie and Jamie go to Chicago for a pharmaceutical convention. Jamies got a group of lookers hanging on his every word. Maggie wanders across the street and into an alternative medical universe. There Denver actress Lucie Roucis is at a lectern giving Parkinsons the Henny Youngman treatment. Shes funny and biting. The actress who performs with the theater company PHAMALy provided insights for Hathaway and Zwicks understanding of Maggies prospects psychic and physical. When he goes looking for Maggie Jamie finds a spouse who has a thing or two to say about what their future might look like. ""Its not a disease its a Russian novel."" ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" has us ponder ""What would I do."" Thanks to the stars this really is a dual conundrum. Would we stay? Would we shove a lover away? Would we take that shove as an opportunity to run like hell? Would we see that abandonment as exactly what we expected to happen? These are quandaries in a movie that manages its pains and pleasures with benevolent and entertaining flair.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 24 2010 Save for later Saved Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are shown in a scene from Love and Other Drugs. David James/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of As ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" demonstrates the trouble with movies that try to be all things to all people is that they end up being not altogether anything for anybody.Set in 1996 its a lumpy grab bag of comedy and tragedy of spirits high and low with more than a modicum of sex. The almost retro photogenic allure of stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway is the real subject (and drawing power) of the movie.On the plus side both actors particularly Gyllenhaal are more unbound (no pun intended) than weve seen them before. He plays Jamie Randall a hot-shot Pfizer pharmaceutical rep whose rampant womanizing comes to a screeching halt when he encounters Hathaways Maggie Murdock an artist who has early onset Parkinsons disease. (They meet when he sneaks a peek at her breast during a medical exam.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Maggie turns out to be a female version of the presmitten Jamie - she wants sex with no attachments. Inevitably she becomes attached. Were supposed to think shes been holding out because given her prognosis she doesnt want to fall in love. But Maggie to Hathaways credit looks like she was born nobodys fool. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The early scenes between Jamie and Maggie are the films best. Freed up from gallivanting with CGI effects a la ""Prince of Persia"" Gyllenhaal is refreshingly disarmingly boyish. Jamie makes his living hustling Zoloft and triumphantly Viagra to mercenary physicians like Hank Azarias Dr. Knight but hes essentially an innocent. Thats why Maggie wised-up and afflicted gets to him and its also why once they are a couple he goes a little crazy trying to track down a cure for Parkinsons.If director Edward Zwick and his coscreenwriters Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph had focused on Jamies transformation from gadabout to crusader and jettisoned all the glib not-so-crowd-pleasing shenanigans along the way they might have come up with something more lasting than a glorified sitcom misted over with tears. (The source material is Jamie Reidys nonfiction memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman."") But too often the big emotional trajectories such as Jamies feverish medical skullduggery are presented as high-speed montages - as if the audience would be bored otherwise.And do we really need Jamies slobbo brother (Josh Gad) as a running gag? Hes a sop to the goony sub-Apatow crowd. We also dont need quite so many shots of googly-eyed females (such as the medical receptionist played by Judy Greer) eyeing Jamie as if he was fresh meat. This sort of thing went out with Dean Martin and 007.What we could do with more of is the films attack albeit with kid gloves on the collusion between doctors and Big Pharma. Zwick is known for socially conscious political epics like ""Blood Diamond"" and ""Defiance"" so his alternately goofy and somber once-over-lightly approach to medical malfeasance seems like a wasted opportunity - especially since the films forced levity and echoes from ""Love Story"" arent exactly an adequate trade off.The filmmakers were clearly hellbent on not making a movie-of-the-week weepie. But at least those weepies carry the conviction of their own mass-appeal sentimentality. They may be egregious but they dont try to be anything more than they are. ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is a slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know theyre better than the schlockmeisters. Theyve outsmarted themselves.

By David Denby Natalie Portman as a tormented dancer in Darren Aronofskys movie.   Credit Photograph by Niko Tavernise Darren Aronofskys ""Black Swan"" is a luridly beautiful farrago--a violent fantasia that mixes the tensions of preparing a new production of ""Swan Lake"" with sex blood and horror-film flourishes. Natalie Portman is Nina a soloist in a New York ballet company who lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) a hysterically protective retired dancer and falls under the sway of the brilliant artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). In the story of Tchaikovskys ""Swan Lake"" an evil magician controls two beauties who are swans by day and women by night Odette the White Swan associated with purity and Odile the evilly seductive Black Swan who is the magicians daughter. Both roles are usually performed by a single dancer--its an extraordinary challenge. In the movie Thomas tells Nina that she has the talent and the temperament to dance the White Swan but that shes too frigid for the dark side. He becomes her sorcerer dominating and inflaming her caressing and coming on to her and Nina a virtuous hardworking girl begins to develop black-swan attributes. She appears to have a nasty double a second version of herself which she catches glimpses of here and there. She drinks takes drugs has sex. Rashes and abrasions appear on her back where wings might be; her toes web together; and she picks at her fingers until they bleed stigmatizing herself. At the same time another young dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) also appears to have two personalities a friendly one who encourages Nina; and a predatory one who wants to destroy her and dance the Odette/Odile role herself. Nina moves toward opening night in a panic still not sure if Thomas will let her dance. Freud said that meeting ones doppelganger in life or in dreams produces sensations of the uncanny but isnt one double enough? This movie has three sets theres also the washed-up ballerina (played in a cruel bit of casting by Winona Ryder) who previously danced the role and whom Nina tries to emulate--she steals lipstick from her dressing room--as well as replace. Actually there are four if you count Ninas mother with whom Nina shares a clammily intimate relationship and the same pulled-back hair and clenched manner. ""Black Swan"" turns Freuds uncanny into shtick; the sinister elements are overloaded and overdetermined. After a while you realize that the film is a case of ersatz formalism disguising chaos. For instance the ""All About Eve"" business with dancers preying on one another was retained from a discarded screenplay by Andres Heinz who worked on the final version of ""Black Swan"" with Mark Heyman and John J. McLaughlin. As a device its clunky and redundant. So are the repeated scenes of Nina entering her Upper West Side apartment which becomes a house of demons and a freezing wash of horror-film sounds that play again and again. The Grand Guignol can be understood as an invasion of the supernatural into a dancers life or as the delusions of an ambitious young perfectionist. Aronofsky has it both ways aestheticizing insanity and playing scare-movie tricks at the same time. The film is often ridiculous yet there are startlingly beautiful sequences; right at the beginning Nina dances under a spotlight in a white tutu against a vibrant black background. Aronofsky working with the cinematographer Matthew Libatique and the designer Therese DePrez has produced the hard glitter of an old mirrored music box. The filmmakers use four principal colors representing the psychological and physical moods of the story white black pink (the color of the stuffed animals in Ninas bedroom) and gash red. This crazed aestheticism has its own kind of passion. ""Black Swan"" certainly isnt bland like ""The Turning Point""; instead it bears some resemblance in spirit to the death-haunted ""Red Shoes."" Aronofsky understands and reproduces the controlled savagery of ballet--the stressed flaring emotionalism of young dancers the wracking spiritual and physical demands made on breakable bodies. He films the dancing with a circling weaving bobbing camera that seems to be moving (almost dancing itself) in rhythm with the music. The performance sequences at their best come close to ecstasy while the rehearsal sequences are disciplined and businesslike. Off the dance floor however ""Black Swan"" is trashy and incoherent. Aronofsky for all his gifts is a gaudy maestro opportunistic and insecure as an artist. Almost every sequence is shot with a handheld camera and poor Nina cant go anywhere--not even down a corridor--without the camera stalking her. Aronofsky keeps us in a state of anxiety from beginning to end. Hes such an extremist that he never creates a normal reality to take off from so the outbreaks of violence dont shock as much as they might. As Thomas the French star Vincent Cassel is a portrait of studliness (even his nose is virile). Tall and straight he has a superb presence; he blusters through the role and gets away with it. Natalie Portman has a sinewy dancers body and the control and the single-mindedness to play a driven unhappy girl. With her perfect features she also has the taut masklike beauty that so many female dancers attain. Portman has been dancing since she was a child and aided by some digital finishing she does well enough in the ballet sequences. That is she doesnt make a fool of herself which given the possible comparisons is saying a great deal. But Aronofsky has coaxed her into giving a dolorous performance thats often on the verge of caricature. She suppresses tears then trembles cries crumples--shes always collapsing--and her neck chords stand out like ships rigging. Cold-eyed viewers will see ""Black Swan"" less as a movie about ballet than as a movie about the torture of a young woman. Dance lovers will find it so over the top that they are likely to be amused. The picture is too bizarre to be a desecration of ""Swan Lake"" which is as indestructible as ""Macbeth."" ""Black Swan"" says that a dancer must enter into the irrational and the erotic--even destroy herself--in order to make art. That is if you dont get laid and you arent ready to kill your rival or yourself you cant be a great dancer. But the directors erotic and punitive notion of art is his own obsession not a dancers. His movies are about people destroying their bodies the drug addicts in ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) Mickey Rourke razoring his flesh in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). In ""Black Swan"" Aronofsky goes all the way with his taste for mutilation. He imposes his own bloodlust on a womans mind and then turns her into a myth of sacrifice. ""Black Swan"" is a pompous self-glorifying and generally unpleasant interpretation of an artists task. The movie has the Romantics fascination with death without their spiritual eloquence which turns morbidity into art. ""Black Swan"" is every bit as beautiful as a tray of Russian Easter eggs. Maybe someone should crack one of them on Aronofskys noggin and bring him to his senses. Jake Gyllenhaal has played his share of melancholy young men but in ""Love and Other Drugs"" set in the nineteen-nineties his eyes and body are alive and hes active in bed both as a pleasure and as a professional aid. He plays Jamie Randall a self-hating but flirtatious and irresistible pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer. He and his mentor Bruce (Oliver Platt) besiege clinics and doctors hoping to persuade them to prescribe Pfizers Zoloft rather than Lillys Prozac. (They dont have much trouble getting them to take on Viagra.) The movie directed by Ed Zwick and written by Charles Randolph Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick who adapted a memoir by Jamie Reidy has some broadly played but knowing satirical sequences of drug reps trying to seduce medical secretaries and bribing and pimping for doctors. Then suddenly the movie shifts away from satire Jamie meets Maggie Murdock (Anne Hathaway) a beautiful young woman with early-onset Parkinsons who likes sex but doesnt want love since she knows her condition will impose an unmanageable burden on any man who falls for her. Hathaways features are so big and bright that they seem to take over her face; she can look like a clown in some shots and ravishing in others. But shes not just vivid and generously expressive; she has become in her last few roles a high-flying actress who reveals everything thats inside her characters. Through sheer conviction she makes the defiant-dying-girl tearjerking cliches work. And her sex scenes with Gyllenhaal are the most intimate and erotic glimpses of romantic love that weve seen in American movies in years. The two of them lounge naked in bed talking making love finessing a scene of Jamies impotence that could have been embarrassing but becomes genuinely funny. ""Love and Other Drugs"" has many weak spots but what it delivers at its core is as indelible as (and a lot more explicit than) the work of such legendary teams as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

Photo by Twentieth Century Fox Love and Other Drugs Love and Other Drugs better as a satire than romance BY JOE WILLIAMS -- Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Nov 23 2010 (...) Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal in Love and Other Drugs. Photo by Twentieth Century Fox Whenever a movie is peddling a peek behind the curtain Im an interested buyer. As a critique of free enterprise the pharmaceutical satire ""Love and Other Drugs"" is worthy of mention with caustic comedies like ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Office Space."" But as in the recent marketing movie ""The Joneses"" an injection of romance makes this seemingly fearless film go limp.Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a born salesman -- handsome charming and blunt about his ambitions. Fired from a stereo store for fraternizing with a customer he takes a job with Pfizer circa 1996. At the climax of a corporate pep rally (complete with cheerleaders) hes assigned to promote the anti-depressant Zoloft to physicians in the Midwest. Jamies mentor is Bruce (Oliver Platt) a cynical middle-aged skirt-chaser. But Jamie hardly needs the help. Soon he is schmoozing -- and seducing -- the assistants to an influential Chicago doctor (Hank Azaria).When Jamie expands the playing field to include Maggie (Anne Hathaway) an artistic young woman in the early stages of Parkinsons disease Randall runs into two obstacles Maggies refusal to complicate their gymnastic sex with emotional entanglements; and her ex-lover Trey (Gabriel Macht) a former Marine who happens to be a rival rep for Prozac. Jamies work and personal life go on the upswing after Pfizer unveils Viagra. Director Edward Zwick (""The Last Samurai"") adapting a memoir by salesman Jamie Reidy gets so caught up in the frenzy of free samples and sex parties you almost expect Jamie to shout ""Show me the money"" But instead he turns into the Tom Cruise who utters ""You complete me.""As Jamie realizes money cant buy happiness and he devotes himself to finding a cure for Maggies disease the film develops the debilitating side effect of sincerity. Because Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have a potent chemistry thats based in brutal truthfulness they cant redeem scenes like a jaw-dropping meltdown in a hospital lobby or a traffic-stopping declaration of love.""Love and Other Drugs"" is successful in small doses but the full regimen needed more testing.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 24 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Love amp; Other Drugs is quite the little cocktail of mood-brighteners a movie narcotic easy to take and since the effects wear off quickly even easier to forget. Sure the critically sensitive may be left with a slight hangover but that too wont linger. Transparently eager to be this years version of Up in the Air a witty rom-com with a serious side the film lacks the loft to get us there. Instead we hover at the level of occasional amusement high enough to elevate our spirits and dampen if not entirely eliminate those negative instincts. Altogether not a bad trip. Movies Love amp; Other Drugs The official trailer The script is a compendium of archetypes flirting with cliche some given a clever twist others doled out straight up and one of them invested with an Oscar-seeking performance. The first arrives early in the glib hunk that is Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal). Yep Jamie is a ladies man an indiscriminate charmer the family black sheep in wolfs clothing. The guy is also your stock snake-oil salesman although the time being 1996 the snake is Big Pharma and the oil hes peddling is Zoloft which is running a distant second to Prozac on the main streets of Ohio. So Jamie tries harder diligently sleeping his way into the marketplace - serially bedding receptionists and nurses to gain access to the doctors inner sanctum where he unzips his sample case and shifts his motor-mouth into top gear. Keen to show off his comic mettle Gyllenhaal tries hard too honing in on his female targets with those baby blue bug-eyes and firing at will. Jake does pretty boy pretty well and these initial scenes breeze along nicely at least when Edward Zwick a director prone to epic-itis isnt slowing things down by inflating the gags and underlining the obvious. The rom enters the com in the form of another archetype the beautiful woman afflicted with the disease-of-the-week. Seems Maggie (Anne Hathaway) suffers from ""early-onset Parkinsons."" Very early apparently since her only symptoms appear to be 1) an ultra-quick wit; 2) a disdain for emotional commitment and; 3) a vast appetite for casual sex. In other words she out-Jamies Jamie. Of course they meet whereupon somewhat more surprisingly Zwick has his co-stars doff their clothes in a steamy succession of quickies regularly punctuated by the satisfied gal turning the tables on the needy guy by dryly insisting ""Its time for you to go."" Naturally in this battle of the commitment-phobes he loses and his defeat proves painfully funny - a full-blown panic attack as those three little words of love perch precariously on his unmanned lips. Less amusing are the Viagra jokes. Now pushing the new pill that doubles as a revolution Jamie and his fortunes are on the rise all the way to the priapism gag you just knew Zwick couldnt resist. Meanwhile back on the disease front Maggie is starting to display some worrisome tremors along with a hitherto invisible streak of altruism - at one point she can be seen leading a busload of seniors to Canada in quest of cheaper prescription drugs. That scene and a few others of similar ilk - a doctor accepting perks from the pharmacy giants actual Parkinsons victims describing the stages of their illness - see the picture reaching over to the serious half of the ledger. Lets just say that its reach exceeds its grasp. Luckily when it comes to mining pathos from the laughs Hathaway is a lot more successful than the script. As the plot turns and Maggies vulnerability gets exposed she taps deftly into her own serious side playing the dialogue far better than its written and momentarily at least lending the character some emotional weight. Obviously this is the sort of role - sentimentality disguised as pluck - that Oscar loves. More to the point Hathaway is the sort of actress who can validate that love filing away the cheapness and artifice to make it seem almost real almost worthwhile. Almost because she cant do it alone. Her performance is sharply etched but the rest is just a mild fog a slight intoxicant often pleasant and soon gone.

The story A free spirit and a pharmaceuticals executive embark on an unlikely love affair with intoxicating results. Starring Anne Hathaway Jake Gyllenhaal Oliver Platt Hank Azaria Judy Greer Brenna Roth Gabriel Macht Jaimie Alexander George Segal Katheryn Winnick Director Edward Zwick Running time 143 Release Opened Nov 24 2010  Editorial Review Love amp; Other Drugs Dont call us in the morning By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 24 2010 Give Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway this much They have the best eyes in the business. Thats the most cheering takeaway from ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" a jagged little pill of a movie from baby boomer avatar Edward Zwick (""thirtysomething""). Here Zwick turns his attention to millennials riding the financial bubble at the turn of the 21st century. We all know how that turned out and the retrospective bitterness finally curdles what might have been a quirkily of-its-time love story. ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" plays like a grotesque group portrait of pigs at the trough. (The movie is loosely based on Jamie Reidys memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman."") And none of those pigs is feeding more blithely than Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal) a charming rake and underachiever who becomes a pharmaceutical salesman for Pfizer; during his rounds he meets Maggie (Hathaway) a spiky bohemian whose elbows-out demeanor belies a meltingly soft center inside. Its a character Hathaway proved adept at channeling in ""Rachel Getting Married"" and here she exploits Maggies contradictions to the hilt reveling in her unkempt overalls and dirty feet while maintaining perfectly curled hair. When her preternaturally lambent brown eyes meet Gyllenhaals big blues its like a standoff between the genetically super-gifted (""Whose Chromosomes Will Win""). As a couple with deep commitment issues (hers far more sympathetically motivated than his) Gyllenhaal and Hathaway generate a simmering erotic heat and when the story takes a serious turn she especially keeps things tartly crisp and safely out of ""Love Story"" melodrama. Despite some grave challenges Maggie emerges as only the warm-blooded empath in a pit of vipers each of whom is on an aggressive path of greed sexual manipulation and ego gratification. The supporting characters who range from slimy to merely off-putting include Stan (Hank Azaria) an ethically challenged physician and Bruce (Oliver Platt) Jamies mentor-slash-competitor at Pfizer. But the most loathsome of the pack Jamies porcine brother Josh (Josh Gad) a slovenly tech millionaire who somehow cant afford his own place when his wife throws him out. ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" admittedly features a terrific Hail Mary of a climactic scene. But too often the moral of this story seems to be ""Love means never having to say you."" Contains strong sexual content nudity pervasive profanity and some drug material.

Photo 20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch A romantic comedy that is willfully anti-romance and woefully anti-funny ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" bids to be a Judd Apatow-ized ""Jerry Maguire."" But 100 minutes of bitterness and raunch followed by a few minutes of honeyed niceness is a formula for self-negation. The movie is about the journey from jerkdom of a dashing cad a bedroom-eyed imp who makes the ladies tremble and the guys want to come in for a chest bump. Tom Cruise being middle-aged and Cary Grant being dead the filmmakers decided to try their luck with um Jake Gyllenhaal. Sure why not? His last six movies flopped but that cant be because of any charisma deficit in this so-so actor who despite having packed on a carload of pure muscle still seems better-suited to playing the cringing nerd he was in ""Zodiac."" Gyllenhaals vigorous Cruise-isms -- klieg-light smile gesturing like an air-traffic controller -- might well earn him acclaim as the coolest guy at the Outback Steakhouse during happy hour. But he falls way short of providing whats needed to make you like or even take an interest in the bastard he plays in this movie. Conning his way into the exam room of a doctor he is trying to sell on Zoloft the character a pharmaceuticals rep is present while a young Parkinsons sufferer (Anne Hathaway) discusses her sad circumstances -- then he stares as she shows the doctor a splotch on her breast. Hands up ladies if you think this is a cute way to meet a guy. Five minutes later theyre in the sack. There is that dreary little problem though Her incurable degenerative disease. Equally dreary are the supporting characters The doctor (Hank Azaria) and a second drug salesman (Oliver Platt) are ethically challenged. The Gyllenhaal characters brother (Josh Gad) a hairy meat-sack who looks so much like Jack Black that he should pay royalties to the original has none of Blacks wicked flair. None of these guys are meant to be cuddly but they are meant to be funny. They arent. I give the film credit for the detail with which it delves into the pharmaceuticals industry and raises points about its practices. And despite being co-written and directed by the venerable Ed Zwick (""Thirtysomething"" ""Glory"") it makes an effort to break out of the rom-com formula ghetto. But Zwick gazes around the landscape and thinks Dirty jokes are in Sort of but if you have to say ""I think Ill teach myself raunchy"" the way an immigrant decides to learn English youre probably not going to get it right. An orgy scene earns no laughs because the central figure is cheating on his sick girlfriend. A sex tape could be funny but not with a serious disease lurking. Porno plus Parkinsons dont quite add up to sexy fun.

Im just not convinced that the best way to rejuvenate a familiar genre is with self-consciously edgy sex scenes and groan-inducing gags. Rarely has a movie strained so hard to seem original and come off so awkward in the process.Love amp; Other Drugs is loosely inspired by a 2005 nonfiction book called Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. It drops us into an intriguing milieu the go-go world of prescription drug sales reps in the late 1990s just as the blockbuster cure-all Viagra was being released into the market.Gyllenhaals Jamie Randall has been struggling to find his groove in life when he takes a job with Pfizer. He immediately discovers he has a knack for the schmoozing and glad-handing it takes to persuade doctors to begin prescribing certain drugs.With his wide blue eyes square-sculpted chin and swept-back hair Gyllenhaal is the closest his generation has to an old-school matinee idol. The problem is that his performance starts from an obvious place basically the Tom Cruise-in-Rain Man hot shot and evolves even more predictably. On one of his doctors office visits he meets Hathaways free-spirited Maggie. The two of them embark upon what should be an ideal relationship - hot sex with no strings attached - until you guessed it Jamie decides he wants more.Theres certainly a terrific movie waiting to be made about the modern phenomenon of ""friends with benefits"" people whose sexual needs are so easily satisfied that they never feel the urge to develop any deeper relationships. Thats not this movie. The sexual relationship here feels like a stunt and a not especially sexy one at that.Zwick films Gyllenhaal and Hathaway often naked in multiple couplings but theres no heat between the performers no sense of danger or intensity. Truly erotic onscreen couplings - Maria Schneider and Marlon Brando in Last Trango in Paris or even Heath Ledger and Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain - require actors willing to come unhinged before our eyes. These two just seem like well-lit models in a soft-core Cinemax fantasy.Even more awkward than the romance are the attempts by Zwick and his co-screenwriters Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz to score laughs. Josh Gad (from 21) plays Jamies obnoxious brother recently single and camped out on Jamies couch. At various points in the film he watches a sex tape featuring Jamie and Maggie. My best guess is that Zwick - who with Herskovitz created T hirtysomething in the 80s but is now pushing 60 - thought that young viewers would find this outrageous. More likely whether youre 18 or 81 youre just going to find the bizarrely incestuous overtones icky. (The rest of the supporting actors - George Segal and the now-deceased Jill Clayburgh as Jamies parents; Oliver Platt as his co-worker - are wasted.)One or two provocative bits emerge from the incoherence At one point Jamie and Maggie attend a Parkinsons conference where Jamie talks to a man (Peter Friedman) who advises him against getting involved with someone who has the disease. What does it mean the movie asks to marry someone who is going to be ""in sickness"" a lot more than shes going to be ""in health""? Even this scene feels contrived Would a guy who seems perfectly normal no matter how frustrated or tired share such intimate details with a complete stranger?At his best in a movie like Defiance or on the television show My So-Called Life Zwick applies a Hollywood polish to recognizably human dilemmas. Love amp; Other Drugs finds him at his worst synthetic and bombastic.Directed by Edward ZwickStarring Jake Gyllenhaal Anne Hathaway Josh Gad Judy Greer and Hank AzariaRun time 113 minutesMPAA rating R (strong language sexual content nudity drug material) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Love and Other Drugs (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Love and Other Drugs (R) Film fares well as funny not so much as drama Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/24/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Love and Other Drugs is much like every other romantic comedy youve ever seen Boy meets girl and all is swell until an obstacle arises that threatens to them apart and by films end ... well you know. Despite its formulaic roots (they take a while to surface but they will) there are two key ingredients that make the film stand out from the pack. One is something too often lacking from PG-13 love stories This is a surprisingly sexy movie in which Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Maggie (Anne Hathaway) whose relationship is spent almost entirely in the bedroom often doff their clothes for some casual but refreshingly adult lovemaking. This kind of thing was the norm in the 1970s and rampant nudity was a craze in the 1980s but bare skin had gradually vanished from movie screens in the last 20 years with the rise of chaste romcom princesses such as Julia Roberts and there is pleasure to be had watching a movie that isnt afraid of what is usually at the core of the start of most long-lasting affairs. The films other secret weapon is Gyllenhaal who has never had a chance to be this loose and comical. Jamie is a ladykiller He can seduce women - any woman - whether hes selling cheap stereos at a retail store or peddling pharmaceuticals for Pfizer. Hes a confident immensely likable lothario and hes a terrific comedian too. He gives the movie its thrumming energy. Love and Other Drugs was directed by Edward Zwick returning to his love-story roots (About Last Night TVs thirtysomething) after a series of large-scale adventures (The Last Samurai Blood Diamond Defiance). Zwick paces the first half-hour of the film as a breathless comedy raising your hopes that here finally is a chick-flick guys can enjoy. But once Jamie and Maggie get serious and he discovers she suffers from Parkinsons Disease the movie becomes increasingly dramatic. Set in 1998 when Pfizer began marketing Viagra Zwick often cuts away to Jamies overwhelming success marketing the wonder pills to doctors and clients who cant get enough (there is also a good gag involving someone who has a negative reaction to the pill). At heart though Love and Other Drugs is a movie about a young man who must decide if he is willing to spend the rest of his life with a woman destined to grow sicker and more dependent as they age. The question is a provocative one and Hathaways performance - shes prickly and keeps men at arms length because she knows they will all eventually leave her - gives the film some edge. But the resolution is never in question and the final teary scene is particularly weak a canned monologue that could have been lifted from countless other pictures in which in an immature man vows to grow up. Love and Other Drugs doesnt quite avoid the pitfalls of its genre but at least the movie has the decency to make you laugh on its way to a foregone conclusion. Also did I mention the sex?

Photo David James AP Love and Other Drugs review Hathaway remarkable 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Love and Other Drugs Drama. Starring Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Edward Zwick. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Love and Other Drugs"" is about people in the midst of their lives who arrive at somewhere precious by accident. Its about ambition and commerce because life is about ambition and commerce but it soon transmutes into a love story because life is often that too. Love becomes for two people the great challenge and the great educator and at every step of this beautiful film we believe it. As the opening credits flash the movie establishes Jake Gyllenhaal as Jamie a likable rogue who can charm the pants off anybody. He gets a job as a pharmaceutical salesman for Pfizer and some of ""Love and Other Drugs"" has the feeling of an expose. The drug representatives are sleazy and even worse the doctors are willing to be corrupted with money vacations gifts. Zwick and screenwriters Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz in adapting Jamie Reidys memoir (""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"") give us this drug-and-money world in detail and the movie benefits even though love not drugs is really the subject here. The movie establishes a world of texture and reality as well as characters with specific life visions that are intruded upon by strong emotions. These emotions take them places they dont expect. Gyllenhaal is winning and heartfelt delineating Jamies journey from glib superficiality to manhood though perhaps thats not such a difficult thing to play. Nor can it be especially hard to convince an audience that youre in love with Anne Hathaway. Certainly not in this movie. Until now Anne Hathaway has been a good actress a smart actress an actress with potential and an actress with a future. With ""Love and Other Drugs"" her future begins. She is remarkable and moving as a 26-year-old in the very early stages of Parkinsons disease who has decided to take control of her emotional life by allowing herself to become close to nobody. In that way shallow Jamie is the ideal consort - amusing and good for sex and not much good for anything else. The role is written well. Maggie (Hathaway) forced to face the reality of her health situation has no hesitation about facing interpersonal realities - and of saying whatever she thinks. But of course anyone this barnacled must be protecting something soft underneath and when she briefly lets down her guard and shows us who she is and what she has been hiding its heartbreaking. Yet I dont want to leave the impression that Hathaways is a performance in two modes covered and uncovered. There are layers and layers of barriers and at all times were watching Hathaways expressive eyes to see how far Maggie will allow herself to go how much shell dare to show. Speaking of daring to show Hathaway deserves praise for going along with the movies sexual frankness. The nudity here is necessary not only for verisimilitude (in real life people do tend to take off their clothes) but also because the sex scenes mean something here. Theyre not static set pieces but the means by which two people determined not to say anything communicate. Their bodies do the talking first and we know what theyre saying before theyre willing to admit it. Its a powerful thing to witness. As is appropriate in a well-crafted and meticulous movie the acting is strong down the line. Im thinking in particular of Kate Jennings Grant who nails her two scenes as a trainer of Pfizer personnel and Peter Friedman who has one scene as a man who has been caring for a wife with Parkinsons for 23 years. His weariness and anger stay with us for the length of the film and beyond. The late Jill Clayburgh also makes a brief appearance as Jamies mother. At times but only at times there are moments where characters seem to want to make speeches like people do in movies and so they do and it feels like Hollywood. Worse some of the shtick involving Jamies younger brother (Josh Gad) comes under the category of gross slapstick. It belongs in a lesser movie. Still sitting through the silliness is a small price to pay to see Hathaway do some of the loveliest work of the year. -- Advisory This movie contains nudity sexual situations simulated sex and strong language.

But at the risk of seeming ungrateful the way this mashup of Love Story and Jerry Maguire brags about its characters fantastic sex life is something of a turnoff. While Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry and director Edward Zwick moves the narrative along nicely the film is too self-satisfied to be genuinely touching. We remain spectators observing the greatness of their love physical and otherwise. (See the top 10 worst chick flicks.) Artistic Maggie (Hathaway) has fantastic boobs and early-onset Parkinsons disease. Shes not dying like Ali MacGraw but shes deteriorating. Her sense of impending doom has made her determined to remain at a remove from any man she sleeps with but at the same time to self-medicate with orgasms. Pfizer pharmaceutical rep Jamie (Gyllenhaal) meanwhile has a sizable member and a cold heart. We see no actual evidence of the former -- this is only a full-dorsal movie -- but Jamies loser younger brother Josh (Josh Gad) tells us so and about this subject we have to assume no brother would wish to exaggerate. Evidence of the latter Jamie has never said ""I love you"" to anyone including his parents. Somebody better complete somebody here and fast. The movie begins in 1996 with college dropout Jamie demonstrating his ability to sell anything to anyone in a record store including his own caddish self (hes depicted as an irresistible Lothario). They meet when Maggie turns up with a wad of cash -- she has no health insurance -- at the office of a smarmy doctor (Hank Azaria) whom Jamie has been trying to persuade to start prescribing Pfizers antidepressant. (In exchange for enjoying the movie-length advertisement of its wares -- first Zoloft and then Viagra -- Pfizer merely has to endure the mockery of its training process which involves go-go dancers the Macarena and sales leaders who sleep with their trainees.) (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Preview 2010.) Jamie then knows the score about Maggies health at the outset. But thats fine since hes only interested in scoring and so (apparently) is Maggie at least in the beginning. By the time theyre eating Chinese takeout in a rumpled bed together the way couples in movies always do we know theyre in love. After capable but merely cute beginnings (The Princess Diaries) Hathaway has become a wonderful actress. If you didnt fall for her during Brokeback Mountain in which she also played opposite Gyllenhaal or Rachel Getting Married you might have during her perfect Katie Holmes impression on Saturday Night Live on Nov. 20. She gives more to the character of Maggie than Zwick and Charles Randolphs screenplay does. The trappings get in the way shes a collage artist she lives in an artfully disheveled loft with a clawfoot tub in the middle of the living area she escorts busloads of senior citizens to Canada to obtain cheaper prescription drugs. This last item in particular seems like such a cheap way to establish Maggies integrity and goodness; Hathaway can do that with her eyes. Zwick and Randolph also put words in her mouth that really dont fit like the prickly little speech she makes to Jamie about why hed want to be with her -- ""Why? Why? What are you trying to prove?"" -- that rings false for a woman with Maggies self-possession. Hathaway is very good. The problem is the movie is not as good as she is. (See the best movies of the decade.) On the other hand Gyllenhaal not to damn with faint praise is exactly as good as the movie -- which is to say hes fun to watch but not all that convincing when it comes to plumbing the depths. Love amp; Other Drugs has a solid pedigree dramatic urges and more raunch than usual but its still a rom-com. First proof positive the presence of Judy Greer a mainstay of chick flicks playing one of Jamies conquests. Second proof positive the character of Josh who has been wedged into Jamies Ohio River Valley existence on the slimmest of sitcom pretenses. Joshs marriage is in trouble and he needs a couch to crash on even though he recently made 5 million on an IPO. Hes really here to make sure we know Maggies breasts are lovely (Mr. Swick were not blind) amp up the Apatow-style humor (Gad is a poor mans Jonah Hill) and be in constant awe of the sex Maggie and Jamie are having in the next room. I grew tired of being told how hot it all was. Within these cynical confines its no wonder that the classic rom-com epiphany -- the one in which one character realizes they cant live without the other -- comes during a nostalgic viewing of a chatty sex tape.

(David James) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday November 24 2010 400 AM Title Love amp; Other Drugs A pharmaceutical rep romances an ailing artist. With Jake Gyllenhaal Anne Hathaway. Director Edward Zwick (143). R Nudity sexuality language. At area theaters.Weve all suffered from Multiplex Remorse a condition often triggered by a particularly inept date-night movie. You know the symptoms boredom annoyance and the nagging feeling that your IQ is dropping rapidly.Director Edward Zwick believes he has the cure ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" a polished romantic dramedy that wont change your life but might make you a little happier for a couple of hours.The story is based on Jamie Reidys memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" about his years at Pfizer in the late 90s. A smooth-talking charmer Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the kind of guy who could market Xanax to the Dalai Lama. So when a new drug called Viagra arrives he quickly becomes the most popular pharmaceutical rep around. This works nicely with his fast-track plans in which he and his business partner (Oliver Platt) can finally trade their road gig for cushy jobs in Chicago.Theres just one glitch standing in his way a quirky artist named Maggie (Anne Hathaway). Hes initially interested in a quick fling and is happily surprised when thats all she wants too. But since he cant resist a challenge hes determined to find her secrets. Sitting in with her doctor (Hank Azaria) Jamie learns Maggies recently been diagnosed with Parkinsons disease. As they begin dating he also discovers shes nearly overwhelmed by the trials of being both bitter and brave.Despite Jamies slick and well-packaged presentations ""Love"" doesnt have much at its core. Maggie in particular is less a fully sketched human than an overly familiar movie character the beautiful stubborn patient whose attitude hides her fear. Still Gyllenhaal and Hathaway do have great chemistry -- a must for a movie as unabashedly sexual as this one -- and Zwick keeps up a snappy pace. He also makes some effort at topicality assessing our health-care system with shrewd if superficial observations.We never really forget were watching two highly paid professionals create a cinematic placebo strong enough to entertain without making a long-term impact. Fortunately everyone works just hard enough to sell us on the whole thing anyway.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Jenni Pinkley Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Love and Other Drugs"" is a sprawling ambitious romantic comedy drama for grown-ups. It has loads of laughs sharp dialogue scads of sex and sections of sweet gorgeous sadness. Its a giddy concoction all the more remarkable because it comes from director Ed Zwick who made his reputation on war epics such as ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai."" His focus here is on the emotional battles and bedroom skirmishes between hotshot pharmaceutical rep Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway a spunky sarcastic waitress whose vitality camouflages a Very Bad Disease. If you rolled your eyes just then I dont blame you. It sounds contrived. OK it is contrived. But theres magic in the execution. Its a kind of minor miracle the way Zwick and his actors go at the potentially sticky material. Theyre so straightforward that you follow them trusting that they wont embarrass you by doing something stupid. They repay that suspension of disbelief making the story a hair-curling heart-wrenching ballad of love triumphing against the odds served up with heaps of dirty breezy comedy. The show is full of surprises. Gyllenhaals character Jamie is a part Tom Cruise would have played 20 years ago. A hustling home-electronics salesman whos mostly concerned about scoring with pretty customers and co-workers hes the black sheep of his successful family. When he finds his niche working for Pfizer in the mid-90s he rises like a rocket. Were at his side as he learns how to flip doctors prescriptions to his firms brands without actually bribing them. Cajoling clinic receptionists paying physicians bogus ""consulting fees"" he quickly becomes a sales force to be reckoned with. Hes a sure thing to move up out of the Ohio market to big-time Chicago. But the brilliant challenging Maggie (Hathaway) a patient visiting one of Jamies key contacts mesmerizes him. She hates Jamie on sight. He cant resist trying to score with her. Casual sex shades into a deeper commitment. Maggie concerned about Jamies motives and her worsening medical condition tells him to get lost. The relationship is fascinating and contradictory. Maggie uses her illness to avoid real intimacy and Jamie responds to rejection like a bull to the color red. At first they dont react to each other as people but as problems to be resolved. You fear that theyre drifting into a weird codependent masochism. Little by little they recognize their lovers humanity and their own Collective sigh of relief. David James 20th Century Fox Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in ""Love and Other Drugs."" The film raises some worthy questions about our medical priorities but its main concern is entertainment. In tangential subplots Hank Azaria lends great comic support as a womanizing doctor and Josh Gad does a Jonah Hill-type turn as Jamies rich schlubby funny-miserable younger brother. Gyllenhaal gives his best most engaging performance to date but Hathaway carries the film. There are so many paradoxes in that face. Darkness and purity; depth and youth; stillness and animation. (Note to self never miss a chance to see Anne Hathaway.) Her voice can be warm or sharp and her intonation always makes the hidden subtext of her lines clear. ""Love and Other Drugs"" falters in a generic sentimental third-act reconciliation but what came before is strong so lets be lenient. They decided that if they were going to do a sick-girl romance they were going to own it. The result is an uncommonly perceptive (and sexy and funny) romantic drama. I not only recommend it I intend to see it again.

Its a mash-up of several strands of movies melding a less incisive Thank You for Smoking with a steamier Love Story. A brisk opening features a wry look at how pharmaceutical companies ply their wares using all manner of undue influence on doctors and other medical personnel. We meet newbie sales rep Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) a smooth operator in the bedroom whose skills initially dont translate to business. TRAILER Preview Love and Other Drugs Jamie is all kinds of unscrupulous getting doctors to prescribe Zoloft as he secretly disposes of their Prozac supply sleeping with the medical office receptionist to gain access to her boss (Hank Azaria). When Jamie lands the Viagra account his career truly takes off. (Lest this sound dated its set in 1996.) Jamies sales gig leads him to the free-spirited Maggie Murdoch (Anne Hathaway) a vibrant 26-year-old artist with Parkinsons disease. Hes used to emotion-free seduction but Maggie beats him at the commitment-phobe game. Their torrid affair spills over into love. Hathaway and Gyllenhaal burn bright with passion physical and verbal. They manage to come off as engaging even when the plot turns formulaic insisting on forced obstacles contrived separation and predictable scenarios. Both look fantastic -- and theres a lot to see. The abundant nudity is tastefully presented through artful camera angles and clever lighting. As in most rom-coms theres too much reliance on bland montages. In his metamorphosis from womanizing cad to dedicated boyfriend Jamie engages in the kind of grand gestures weve come to expect in love stories such as driving for hours to proclaim his love for an annoyed Maggie in front of a cloyingly approving crowd. At least the crowd -- a busload of elderly people -- doesnt burst into rapturous slow applause. The films exploration of Parkinsons while respectful feels superficial. The realities of a degenerative disease are hinted at but not fully explored. Occasional hand tremors impede some maneuvers but little seems to dampen Maggies lusty appetite . Hathaway is an adventurous actress who has come a long way since 2001s The Princess Diaries. Gyllenhaal showed a soulful side in 2005s Brokeback Mountain where he also co-starred with Hathaway in a far less successful coupling. Both have a flair for cheeky comedy. Director Ed Zwick has experience skewering corruption. He exposed fraud and worse in 2005s Blood Diamond. His jab at insurance and drug companies feels toothless in comparison. Zwicks Once and Again and thirtysomething portrayed emotion more honestly than many TV shows of their time. But in Love and Other Drugs he unevenly weds the satirical and the sentimental.

"Love and Other Drugs review No prescription for what ails Love |       NJ.com comments Love and Other Drugs review No prescription for what ails Love Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 24 2010 at 807 AM View/Post Comments David James Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal in the comedy-drama ""Love and Other Drugs."" Boy meets girl. Girl gets sick. Audience gets Kleenex. A romantic syndrome as old as Camilles first cough its likely to outlast all of us. And it flares up again in ""Love and Other Drugs"" a comedy-drama which unexpectedly and uncomfortably complicates that standard issue weepie with a far more pointed movie about big pharma. Initially the old genres usual rules apply. It has to be the woman whos ill of course not the man. (In Hollywood sick women are tragic; sick men are just sad.) Of course she has to be gorgeous even on her bad days. She has to be incurable as well. And since the days of ""Love Story"" she also has to be acerbic even a little vulgar -- so determined not to play the victim that she laughs at love and proactively pushes away concerned friends. The romantic half of ""Love and Other Drugs"" follows this all slavishly (including an ending thats served so many other films it is worn out from use). That this part of the film works at all is a tribute to star Anne Hathaway. Her Maggie looks back a little to her breakout adult performance in ""Rachel Getting Married"" -- bruised and alone she has gotten into the habit of hurting people before they hurt her. Movie Review Love and Other Drugs (R) Fox (113 min.) Directed by Edward Zwick. With Anne Hathaway Jake Gyllenhaal. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains graphic sexual situations nudity strong language and drug use. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS But Hathaway not only adds unabashed sexuality to the part -- this is the nudest a major actress has been in a while -- but a deeper sort of nakedness her huge eyes full of barely checked yearning. She has a good partner in cocky Jake Gyllenhaal too and the films first smartest choice was to see them as equals. Too often gender-based genre films skimp on the casting; in a typical romance for example Jennifer Aniston or Sandra Bullock eat up all the air in the room (and all the money in the budget) while the co-star ends up being some pleasant second-tier go-along guy. Gyllenhaal though more than carries his weight and his scenes with Hathaway have real heat and tenderness. Unfortunately at other times Gyllenhaal seems to be in a different movie -- an HBO black comedy. In fact hes alone for most of the first act as we watch his mid-90s slacker reinvent himself as a travelling pill-pusher greasing his way into doctors offices. This is a great idea for a picture really and primes us for second-act complications and a third-act takedown of our callow hero. But instead 20 minutes or so in Hathaways acerbic Parkinsons patient arrives and the movie takes its first abrupt turn. Then it swerves again this time into gleefully obscene Apatow-land with the arrival of Viagra and a pervy Jonah-Hill-sized kid brother. And then suddenly -- almost as an afterthought -- it returns to the tragic sexy sick girl. Which ultimately is the problem with the disjointed ""Love and Other Drugs"" another film from filmmaker Edward Zwick (""Blood Diamond"" ""The Siege"") who can be entertaining but wants to be ""important."" And because he doesnt seem to believe you can be both simultaneously he constantly toggles back and forth between the two. All that results here sadly is a blur. And what youre chiefly left with at the end -- despite two fine performances -- is a mild case of emotional whiplash no magic pill is going to cure.

Or at least not bored. (Maybe awake?) The most egregious four-quadrant pander-party of the year Ed Zwicks latest middlebrow atrocity has been so carefully market-tested--crudeness counteracts romance slapstick leavens disease-of-the-week melodrama--that it neednt even be seen just administered directly into the bloody mainstream. Cuddly cubby bear Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jamie Randall an underachieving late-1990s rich kid who learns to channel his sex drive into pimping pharmaceuticals for Pfizer. He hands out Zoloft and Viagra samples between strategic lays before finding his true calling in the company and care of Anne Hathaways eagerly proffered breasts. Jamie and prescription-med-junkie Maggie fuck until they make love then break up/make up over her early-onset Parkinsons. Watching two ripe and fearless young stars nakedly cavort ought to be titillating but Gyllenhaal and Hathaway are so overexposed here that you feel embarrassed for them. Meanwhile Jamies incongruous brother Josh (Josh Gad a poor mans Jonah Hill--which is more impoverishment than I thought possible) is crashed on the couch to counteract adulthood with jerk-off jokes. Buried somewhere in Zwicks film might be a topical modern romance maybe even a health care satire but youd need to dig past layers of creative desperation to find it.

Love amp; Other Drugs Attractile dysfunction | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLove amp; Other Drugs Attractile dysfunctionEdward Zwick doesnt direct many rom-coms and with the Viagra-themed Love amp; Other Drugs you can see why.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 24 2010Love amp; Other Drugs (out of 4)Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Anne Hathaway Oliver Platt and Hank Azaria. Directed by Edward Zwick. At major theatres. 113 minutes. How hard would it be to make a romantic comedy about Viagra? Just ask Edward Zwick.He doesnt direct many rom-coms and with Love amp; Other Drugs you can see why. The genre is way out of his comfort zone. Hes much happier with dramas such as his most recent previous works Defiance and Blood Diamond.Article Continued BelowLove amp; Other Drugs isnt really a comedy although its being pushed as such in the trailer which strongly implies its a laugh riot about the new sexual revolution sparked by the arrival of Viagra in 1998. Its not.Its also not much of a romance although in Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway the film has good leads who do the best they can with difficult and diffuse material.The real problem here is that Zwick and his writing partner Marshall Herskovitz working with writer/producer Charles Randolph really dont know what movie theyre trying to make. Randolph was jazzed by the idea of making a movie out of Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman a fact-based book by Jamie Reidy about the wild life of being a sales geyser for Pfizer when the drug company rolled out its erectile dysfunction fixer.Zwick and Herskovitz tacked on the strained romance of Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway leading the film into the misguided direction of a chronic-disease tear-jerker.Love amp; Other Drugs starts off promising in 1996 with Gyllenhaals Jamie Randall proving his chops as a smoothie who could sell mud in a rainstorm. His horndog antics cost him his job although hes soon up and running again as a salesman for drug giant Pfizer under the watchful eye and scolding tongue of jaded veteran Bruce Winston (Oliver Platt).Jamie meets his match and almost his Waterloo in a salesman for a rival drug firm who is slinging an inferior anti-depression med but doing so with considerably more success. Just as Jamie starts to learn some of his rivals sales tricks the tables are turned as Pfizer rolls out its little blue pill. Suddenly Jamie is the most popular guy in town making pals even with standoffish Dr. Knight (Hank Azaria) who had previously shown him the door.Enter Hathaways Maggie Murdock one of Knights patients who catches Jamies eye and who may go down in history as the first woman to make a Viagra joke. But she has Parkinsons disease which is only going to get worse and lasting romance with Jamie may be out of the question. She needs Jamies love but she resents him for giving it.Suddenly a movie that seemed so light at the beginning turns very dark. Its a credit to the actors that they keep as focused as they do since they get little guidance from either the script or the director.The sex between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is steamier than youd expect in a mainstream movie -- no Viagra is required. But its neither as sexy nor as romantic as that brief moment in Brokeback Mountain when the two played a conflicted couple fumbling in a car.Meanwhile the film keeps veering back into rom-com territory even working in a dumb gag about the four-hour erection warning that is the stuff of late-night comedy routines.

"Movie review Love amp; Other Drugs - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Love amp; Other DrugsAnne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal impress in this love story that gets it right.November 24 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal star in ""Love amp; Other Drugs."" (David James 20th Century...)Finally after years of suffering through Hollywoods predictable pap sentimental mush boring bromances and mean girl clichA(c)s comes a love story that is actually worth falling for with Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal excellent at steaming up the screen in ""Love amp; Other Drugs."" The trick is that in director Ed Zwicks world love hurts. It may be funny charming poignant and sexy and ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is all that too but at some point it stings like astringent on a fresh scrape. Like real life or at least real enough to make for a very nice change of pace in the romantic comedy world. The movie is set in Pittsburgh which has never looked as good as it does through cinematographer Steven Fierbergs lens and is loosely based on ""Hard Sell"" Jamie Reidys memoir of being a Viagra sales rep for Pfizer just as the potent little blue pill hit the market with its performance-enhancing promises. I say loosely because Reidy barely mentions a girlfriend but Gyllenhaals Jamie Randall shares equal time with Hathaways Maggie the funky 26-year-old artist who will be his undoing. For the couple it begins with a close encounter of the inappropriate kind in a doctors exam room with Jamie stealing a peek at one of Maggies private parts only to be cold-cocked by her a few minutes later when she learns he was not an intern just a chump taking advantage of her northern exposure. In the best opposites-attract tradition they quickly move from making peace to making love of the passionate clothes-ripping the-floor-will-do-just-fine sort. Neither one has ""long-term"" in mind which becomes the films central dilemma. Most rom-coms spend their time trying to get to that first embrace (think ""Sleepless in Seattle"" Empire State Building final scene) but ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" spends its time trying to get beyond it. I dont mean to suggest that the movie is free from stereotypes; it is not. Jamie is your typical charming rogue driven by his baser instincts always on the prowl for meaningless sex and making money. Maggie as a smart beautiful artist living the bohemian life is a type too. Shes also sick as it turns out with a new life-altering diagnosis shes learning to cope with. What sets ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" apart is what it does next using the couples interplay as a way for their characters to deepen and get past the clichA(c)s to create something that is actually moving a a relationship with all its conflicting needs and wants and desires. If youre worried about Maggies diagnosis being too much of a bummer all Ill say is this is no ""Love Story"" sob fest. This is however Hathaways movie. She delivers a performance easily as affecting as her emotionally bruised recovering addict in Jonathan Demmes fine "" Rachel Getting Married"" which earned her an Oscar nomination in 2009. Maggie may do it for her again with Hathaway exposing herself both body and soul as she lets us inside this lushly intelligent painfully self-aware heartbreaker of a girl. In Gyllenhaal she has a good match. Hes a little like the ultimate Bridget Jones mash-up of Hugh Grant seduction and Colin Firth sweetness so a complicated lot to take on. Together they sizzle whether theyre spitting and sparring or rolling around naked a they do a lot of both. Its an intimacy that doesnt feel faked or gratuitous despite the fun ""Saturday Night Live"" had with it over the weekend with Hathaway hosting. Gyllenhaal as the bad boy whos really a good guy is better than hes been since his breakout in 2005s ""Brokeback Mountain"" in which Hathaway played his all-too-knowing Texas wife. While Hathaway provides the films heart the guys are responsible for most of its mostly politically incorrect humor. Gyllenhaal has terrific comic timing and good partners in crime with the always-voluble Oliver Platt as Jamies Tums-packing boss; older but still charming Hank Azaria as Jamies best client a Dr. Do Good whos turned into Dr. Feel Good; and a wickedly funny Josh Gad as Jamies millionaire mess of a brother a whiner of the top order. Suffice it to say that with those three Viagra isnt the only blue pill in this movie. With Zwick and his longtime creative collaborator Marshall Herskovitz putting the final polish on the screenplay which began with Charles Randolph (""The Interpreter"") there are echoes of the emotional churn that made ""thirtysomething"" and ""My So-Called Life"" resonate so deeply across prime time years ago. In film Zwick has mostly occupied himself with epic storytelling such as ""Legends of the Fall"" ""Glory"" and ""Blood Diamond"" with the romance of his 1986 rom-com ""About Last Night"" really just a distant (and not that great) memory. Zwick is thankfully much more of a grown-up now in dealing with relationship entanglements. Somehow between the epic and the intimate between Hathaway and Gyllenhaal love doesnt come easy but with ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" at least you dont have to wait. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Crystal Fairy amp; the Magical Cactus is a nice tripJuly 11 2013Review The payoff is small in For the Love of MoneyJune 8 2012Movie review Friends With BenefitsJuly 22 2011Movie Reviews  Time Enough a Warm Story of Families and...October 6 1995MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-love-and-other-drugs-20101124,0,7413714.story",200,loveandotherdrugs21,loveandotherdrugs,latimes

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + WARNING Prolonged exposure to ""Love amp; Other Drugs a romantic comedy-drama about the ups and downs of high-powered pharmaceutical salesman Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) may result in the following side effects Overwhelming sensations of slickness loss of taste and other critical faculties waxy plot buildup severe supporting-character blockage terminal-heroine syndrome and impacted chick-flick cliches. Constipation and brain death may ensue.ADVANTAGES When used as directed this product has three primary benefits that may offset the above conditions. Chief among these is Anne Hathaway in the role of Maggie Murdoch a Pittsburgh free spirit living with stage one Parkinsons disease. Unlike previous sufferers of Unspecified Movie Wasting Syndrome (also known as MacGraws Blight after the star of ""Love Story) Maggie has a diagnosis and symptoms both of which anchor the character in medical reality and allow the actress to create an unexpectedly moving portrait of a young woman coming to terms with infirmity and looming death.A key component in the efficacy of this ingredient is an organic enzyme known as ""star quality which to date has proven resistant to synthesis in the lab. The chief hallmark is an indefinable glow Hathaway has it. The complexity of this compound can even be isolated in a single close-up in a bus-stop scene in which Maggie realizes Jamie is ready to commit whereupon any number of unidentifiable emotions flicker across her face including but not limited to fear. Possible audience reactions may include the minor myocardial infarction known as heartbreak.A secondary benefit of this product may lie in reminding the user of Gyllenhaals qualities as a gifted and inventive actor despite A) chronic underappreciation by many members of the moviegoing public and indeed the author of this medical journal and B) a role that has many of the elements of the now-discredited steroidal stimulant known as Tom Cruise endemic cockiness followed by third-act comeuppance humbling romantic speeches uncontrolled grinning etc.Thirdly the aphrodisiacal nature of the product should not be discounted inasmuch as it may have post-screening utility. Where most romantic comedies sold by major Hollywood drug companies advertise sex without actually including it as an ingredient (see the authors monograph ""The Placebo Effect in the Films of Katherine Heigl) ""Love amp; Other Drugs allows Maggie and Jamie to fall in bed and reluctantly in love with a refreshingly relaxed depiction of nudity and physical pleasure. Users experiencing shock at characters and actors feeling comfortable in their own skins may need reminding that consenting adults who are attracted to each other often do in fact have sex. With their clothes off.KNOWN DRAWBACKS Inactive ingredients include Oliver Platt as Jamies sclerotic sales mentor Hank Azaria as a horndog doctor Judy Greer as a naive hospital administrator Gabriel Macht as the heros Prozac-selling rival and Jill Clayburgh now sadly discontinued and available here only in trace amounts as Jamies mother. Such components effective if used in small doses cancel each other out when deployed en masse. The use of such generics as Josh Gad an off-brand Jonah Hill as Jamies fat crass brother may result in feelings of repulsion and suicidal despair. Aside from Hathaways all female roles are generics.The failure of this product to fully work as advertised can be attributed to its reliance on slow-release particles of dramatic cliche. Patients who have built up normal immunities over time may experience cynicism mild nausea and cramping; in more romantically-inclined users the product may nevertheless perform as expected. The latter should avoid operating heavy machinery.More problematically Edward Zwick Labs makers of such over-the-counter products as ""thirtysomething ""Glory and ""The Last Samurai has engineered ""Love amp; Other Drugs to appear to attack the cancer of late 1990s Big Pharma when go-go sales conventions touted the miracle healing powers of Xanax and Viagra and morally compromised the medical community. However this beneficial purpose turns out to be a masking effect for the products actual use as a purely recreational drug.IN SUM No genuine ideas were wasted in its making. If product proves especially difficult to swallow take with a grain of salt and three or more alcoholic drinks or wait until such time as active ingredients Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have been more effectively utilized elsewhere.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A Stanley Kramer for our times director Edward Zwick has spent much of his career raising social consciousness--about war (Glory Courage Under Fire Defiance) terrorism (The Siege) and human exploitation (Blood Diamond)--while lowering pulses. At his worst his films act as delivery systems for whatever issue happens to be on his mind at the moment and they tend to be plagued with a deflating earnestness. His latest Love And Other Drugs takes aim at the evils of the pharmaceutical industry but Zwick and his actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway seem determined to keep it from becoming An Edward Zwick Film at least in the early going. Charged by an unusually explicit central relationship and a surprisingly tart critique of Big Pharma excesses Love And Other Drugs gets wound up in a fascinating tangle of ill-advised romance and even more ill-advised pill-pushing gamesmanship. Its the untangling thats the problem. Following an arc close to Leonardo DiCaprios reformed mercenary in Blood Diamond Gyllenhaal stars as a charming overeager fortune-chaser who takes a job as a traveling salesman with Pfizer. Paired with a cynical battle-weary veteran (a terrific Oliver Platt) Gyllenhaal zips around the Midwest pleading with doctors to take Zoloft over his competitors more popular anti-depressant Prozac. Meanwhile he strikes up a torrid relationship with Hathaway an early-stage Parkinsons sufferer who accommodates him in the bedroom but isnt looking for anything more serious. When a little blue miracle pill called Viagra hits the market Gyllenhaals business prospects take a dramatic turn for the better but his feelings for Hathaway complicate his future. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have great chemistry together and the best scenes in Love And Other Drugs are unexpectedly libertine in the way they depict a sexual bond leading to an emotional one. Theres also something moving in Hathaways resistance to a relationship she knows will be troubled by any decline in her condition. But inevitably the film takes a turn toward the conventional as Zwick pursues Gyllenhaals redemption-of-a-bastard story on two fronts--professional and personal--and hits the nail harder on pharmaceutical abuses. After resisting much of the way Love And Other Drugs finally asks the audience to forget the terrible impasse between its lovers and treat them like players in a romantic comedy. When Gyllenhaal stops selling out the movie starts. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Tangled Next Movie Review Burlesque Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

"Love and Other Drugs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; love-and-other-drugs ) Love and Other Drugs (United States 2010) November 23 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Edward Zwick is probably best known for his work on television. Along with Marshall Herkovitz he was a driving force behind two long-running TV series (thirtySomething and Once and Again). He was also an important contributor to many others (including My So-Called Life and Family). In between his television endeavors Zwick has found the time to direct ten feature films the majority of which vary from ""good"" to ""excellent."" Love and Other Drugs represents the first time since his early big-screen ventures that Zwick has brought the same kind of relationship-centered dramatic comedy approach to a motion picture. The result bolstered by strong acting and an intriguing back story is an unqualified success. Love and Other Drugs may be the most honest romance to grace the screens during all of 2010. The movie transpires between 1996 and 1999 - a period in American society when the word ""Viagra"" entered the lexicon. Patented by Pfizer in 1996 and approved by the FDA in 1998 Viagra became not merely another drug on the market but the drug for many Americans whether they needed it as a helper for erectile dysfunction or whether they were looking for an injection of pizzazz into their sex life. Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) starts out a career as a Pfizer rep during this time frame. Initially he has difficulties meeting his quotas much to the chagrin of his veteran partner Bruce Winston (Oliver Platt). Then Viagra hits the market and Jamie becomes an instant star whose newest product is desired by the horny influential Dr. Stan Knight (Hank Azaria). Meanwhile Jamie embarks upon a relationship with one of Dr. Knights patients the impulsive brittle Maggie (Anne Hathaway). At age 26 she has experienced early onset Parkinsons and as a defense mechanism she has walled herself off from serious relationships. Jamie is determined to breach those walls but the task may defeat even his glib tongue and confident ways. The first thing one notices about Love and Other Drugs is that its an adult romance. So many current love stories are targeted at teenagers that its rare to find one that sidesteps the numerous contrivances that permeate the genre. Love and Other Drugs presents an honest sometimes brutal chronicle of a complicated relationship. There are no ""meet cutes"" or romantic complications. The issues encountered by Jamie and Maggie are those faced by many couples where emotional openness is a barrier and where the sickness of one partner creates a commitment imbalance. And although Maggies Parkinsons is a factor this is by no means a ""disease of the week"" motion picture. It avoids the cloying artificial sentimentality of a Terms of Endearment. Love and Other Drugs has an unfettered view of sexuality. Its part of the human experience and is treated as such especially since its the initial strand that binds Jamie and Maggie. Zwick has a specific approach to the characters nudity and its not based (exclusively) on titillation. Theres a lot of flesh early in their interaction during the ""Honeymoon phase."" Later as the characters focus shifts from physical to emotional instances of nudity becomes uncommon. There is an inverse relationship between physical nakedness and emotional nakedness. One element of the story that doesnt work as effectively as it might have is a satirical airing of the drug industrys dirty laundry. Although there are insights into how things work none are especially surprising (especially to a cynic like me) and rarely does the screenplay bare its fangs. To the extent that Love and Other Drugs is intended to make a statement about the amorality of the pharmaceutical industry (bus trips to Canada) and the way in which it manipulates doctors and patients (Knights demand for giving preferential treatment to Zoloft over Prozac) it succeeds only partially. The movie works better on a human level than as the bearer of a message. As has been Zwicks trademark on TV although not necessarily in movies drama and comedy are entwined. There are times when the relationship between Jamie and Maggie plays out like a romantic comedy and occasions when it has a closer kinship to a tragedy. The tonal shifts are expertly handled and never seem awkward. The one character who is on hand primarily for comedic purposes Jamies younger brother Josh (Josh Gad) also makes one of the most insightful observations. Working together for the second time as romantic partners (after Brokeback Mountain) Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway show sufficient passion and chemistry for viewers to believe in them as a couple and be invested in the fates of their characters. Both are underrated actors and Love and Other Drugs illustrates the breadth and depth of their abilities. Hathaway in particular has been saddled with baggage dating back to her early career but the growth she has shown as an actress in recent years enriches this performance and allows her to give Maggie multiple dimensions. Gyllenhaals Jamie although less complex is as fully realized. Zwicks resume sparkles with more hits than misses so it should come as little surprise that despite mediocre marketing Love and Other Drugs is a solid entry into a lackluster end-of-the-year season. (And the comparisons to Up in the Air are imprecise - its not nearly that incisive but it has a bigger heart.) Regardless of whether or not this becomes a player in the Oscar game the movie is worth seeing for anyone who cares about a love story that isnt geared for those who are still struggling with the immediate aftereffects of puberty.

More about Love and Other Drugs >> At the heart of this raunchy romantic comedy set in the mid-90s with Jake Gyllenhaal as a Big Pharma salesman hawking the wonder drug Viagra to a happy horny throng is a Love Story-like bummer. Anne Hathaways character a photographer a barista a woman who wants sex without attachment is in the first stages of the degenerative disorder. This needless to say complicates matters when it becomes clear that Gyllenhaals charming cad Jamie has fallen for Hathaways doe-eyed free spirit Maggie. (He loves those eyes and those breasts.) Mixing comedy and melodrama is not a crime. In fact Judd Apatow whose influence is all over Love amp; Other Drugs - to its detriment - pulled off this tricky balancing act (and then some) with Adam Sandler in Funny People. But on some level the marketing deception perpetrated by 20th Century Fox and perhaps complicitly by filmmaker Edward Zwick isnt simply a matter of hoping not to scare people away. It shows a fundamental lack of faith in the material at hand and also a lack of command. Theres no adroitness no grace in the handling of the pitching emotions - funny sad icky - that such a story presents. So in addition to misleading ticket buyers Love amp; Other Drugs becomes as it proceeds terribly askew in tone masturbation jokes and homemade sex vids one minute a teary group testimonial by Parkinsons patients the next. Its easy to see why Zwick who once upon a time profiled yuppie commitment-phobes in About Last Night (Demi Moore and Rob Lowe egads) was interested in the rise so to speak of Viagra and the pervasiveness of pharmaceuticals. This is firm material so to speak (Ill stop but Hathaway doesnt She lets loose a whole cute flurry of erectile-dysfunction-drug puns). Its not just medical its cultural. Drugs for sex drugs for moods drugs for sports drugs for weight loss - Big Pharma sells its wares like the Big Three sell their automobiles. That slick profit-driven ethos is addressed with varying degrees of success in Love amp; Other Drugs as Jamie and his cocktail-swilling mentor (Oliver Platt) tote bags of samples around doctors offices wooing the support staffs handing out pens and umbrellas; at a Pfizer motivational rally where the snappily attired sales force are christened ""fully qualified health care professionals"" and in the shots of a busload of senior citizens (just in case you miss that fact the bus sports a ""Senior Citizens"" sign) heading for Canada to fill prescriptions because they cant afford the prices at home. (Wheres Michael Moore when you need him?) Gyllenhaal and Hathaway strike a certain kind of chemistry and theyve let themselves be filmed naked and entwined coital postcoital smitten and as the Parkinsons business takes over filled with dread. The idea of having two people surrender to love when both professed more sober intentions is the stuff of a thousand rom-coms and at least these two stars bring wit and spark to theirs. But Zwick and his cowriters (Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph) are constantly letting Gyllenhaal and Hathaway down. Jamies big ""I need you"" speech after he has chased Maggie down at an interstate rest stop is pitifully flat. Gyllenhaal stands there eyes wide with earnestness gesticulating spouting cliches. And the less said about Josh Gad who plays Jamies chubby romantically challenged porn-junkie brother the better. Suffice to say that Gads callow dude is to Zwick and his movie as Jonah Hill is to Apatow and his pictures - the insufferable sex-on-the-brain man-boy there to supply moral contrast and comic relief. So is Love amp; Other Drugs the date flick of the season? Maybe. But audiences are just as likely to rush home afterward and check WebMD for Parkinsons symptoms as they are to light up the scented candles and turn the lights down low.

Each ingredient has its uses in treating a specific audience. But the side effects of such an unstable Drugs cocktail on a general population may include episodes of queasiness and loss of appetite. Consider the case of Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Maggie (Anne Hathaway). Its 1996 and these two exorbitantly attractive singles meet kooky under conditions right up the alley of director and co-writer Edward Zwick here harking back to the emotionally chewy content of TV series he used to produce including thirtysomething and My So-Called Life. Maggie is a freewheeling artist with stage 1 Parkinsons disease who doesnt let illness get in the way of a lusty bedroom life. In the tradition of the genre the heroines degenerative disease expresses itself discreetly in a hand tremor without marring her bohemian beauty. Jamie the black-sheep son of an overachieving family is a slick and likable pharmaceutical representative who is in the business for the money -- and also because the script takes its vague muckraking agenda from the tell-all book Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. (Prepare for many many many boner-related jokes.) After hours though Jamie is an impressive bed-hopper with believable skills given Gyllenhaals charm and his excellent white teeth. So when the sales rep happens to sit in while one of his doctor clients examines Maggie (dont tell the AMA about that little irregularity) and the lady flashes her breast then throws Jamie a Howdy salesman smile well whats a player to do? Soon Maggie and Jamie are having sex -- lots and lots and lots of sex shot this way and that and then this way again. Grown-up shagging is probably what youve heard most about in the flirtatious promotion of Love amp; Other Drugs. (Gyllenhaal and Hathaway posed nude on the cover of the November 26 issue of Entertainment Weekly.) But its also the point at which things start to go wrong -- and not because its a hardship to watch famous actors get naked and practice fake sex. Rather its because at just about the time Hathaway drops her garments the movie begins to lose focus unsure of what really matters to the filmmakers. Is it the sex angle and the thrill of how you call it ""European-style"" attention to bodies? The sick-person story that might once have starred Bette Davis? (Is Jamie strong enough to commit to a woman who cant expect a cure and is Maggie tough enough to let a man care for her?) Or is it the pharma-reform angle that formed the basis of this project in the first place and is in its humanitarian agenda probably closest to Zwicks heart? This is after all a ""hot"" movie willing to chill while Maggie attends a Parkinsons support group in which real people with far more visible symptoms than hers make sharp jokes about the quality of their lives. And then in the midst of all this tonal whiplash Zwick amp; Co. court another younger coarser constituency entirely. In a repellent role that ought to stop the comedy trend of fat crude immature Jonah Hill-y sidekick characters dead in its tracks Josh Gad (a Daily Show irregular) barges in as Jamies younger brother also named Josh. The guy is a gross unsocialized obnoxious boor who happens to be a multimillionaire thanks to a recent dotcom killing. Despite the moneybags Joshs wife kicks him out. (Can you imagine?) So Josh crashes his large unkempt carcass on Jamies couch spreads his rank collection of T-shirts and sweatpants around Jamies apartment and well (spoiler alert) masturbates while watching a videotape of Jamie and Maggie getting busy. The characters participation in the story contributes nothing except maybe mild spasms of nausea on the part of the majority of the audience for whom Love amp; Other Drugs is presumably made. The movie trades on the kind of antique sweethearts-in-a-clinch imagery suitable for stories of lovers bravely facing adversity. But whats likely to linger in your memory after this romance-and-illness-and-sex-and-drug-company drama is the crude stuff rather than the tender. Which is depressing. But there are pills for that.

"Big Pharma romance needs a dose of reality - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Big Pharma romance needs a dose of realityLove amp; Other Drugs a 2 starsNovember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Tribune CriticFree spirits Maggie ( Anne Hathaway) and Jamie ( Jake Gyllenhaal) are surprised to find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug in the emotional comedy Love amp; Other Drugs.There are unsightlier hags in the world than Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal and the seriously mood-swinging romantic comedy ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" offers several acres of surface appeal simply because their characters Maggie and Jamie spend a heartening amount of time in bed or near one in various degrees of undress. Unlike most rom-coms the nuditys matter-of-fact here and at its best honest. The sexual current between the shallow Lothario portrayed by Gyllenhaal (a Viagra salesman and how) and Hathaways coffeehouse waitress and part-time artist who is also in stage one of Parkinsons disease leads to both ""movie sex"" (slick a little ridiculous) and something like the real thing exploring the slippery territory between lust and love. I wish director and co-writer Edward Zwicks film had the guts to treat ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" like a grown-up relationship story rather than a relationship story periodically shoved aside by a lame and lamely raunchy romantic comedy for dummies. Viagra jokes even in a movie dealing with the cultural shake-up brought on by Viagra itself tend to be...stupid. At least these are. They put the ""obvious"" in ""obvious."" Set in 1996 Zwicks picture has a tiny bit in common with ""The Social Network"" in its depiction of the very recent past as a distinct historical period. The Gyllenhaal characters compulsive womanizing suits his career path as a high-flying late 20th century drug salesman; as even a lot of pharmaceutical reps will probably admit after a glass of wine looks and nerve really are a big part of the job. Jamies coarse clueless brother (an aggravating turn from Josh Gad) is Jamies opposite All money -- hes a software millionaire -- and no social graces. As for Maggie well shes almost a character. More like a collection of cynical attitudes and defense mechanisms. As she and Jamie fall into each others arms she stays wary -- she knows whats coming for her health-wise and doesnt believe his expressions of commitment beyond what happens between the sheets. Zwick and co-writer Marshall Herskovitz gave us ""thirtysomething"" and much of that series creamy glossy visual and thematic style persists here. If I bought it Id use a different word than ""persist"" but too much of ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" settles for facile point-making and prettiness. Hathaway saves as much of it as she can She alone inhabits the credulity-stretching dual personalities of the picture with ease often movingly. Gyllenhaal less convincing his speech rhythms and instincts seem a little dazed and sluggish for the farce-driven bits and while his big soulful eyes match up rather strikingly with Hathaways something in the character of Jamie both as written and acted remains opaque. Hes meant to be a hollow man who learns how to fill himself up with the right stuff but still. Maybe Im in the minority; maybe Zwicks film will click with a big audience. I like it when it stays off-narrative in bed and in tune with its hard-shell central lovers. The rest of it the scenes with the brother with the drug-rep wars....strictly a placebo. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong sexual content nudity pervasive language and some drug material) Cast Anne Hathaway (Maggie); Jake Gyllenhaal (Jamie); Oliver Platt (Bruce); Hank Azaria (Dr. Knight); Josh Gad (Josh) Credits Directed by Edward Zwick; written by Charles Randolph Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz based on the book ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by Jamie Reidy; produced by Scott Stuber Zwick Herskovitz Randolph and Pieter Jan Brugge.

Love and Other Drugs careens from bathos to bromance to naked sexytime. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 23 2010 1005 AM Emotional Overdose Love and Other Drugs careens from bathos to bromance to naked sexytime. By Dana Stevens Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal in Love and Other Drugs One thing Ill say for Love and Other Drugs (20th Century Fox) It doesnt feel like any other romantic comedy of recent years or really any romantic comedy I can think of. Though the film partakes in its share of the genres cliches (including one characters last-act revelation that he or she truly loves another character after all and must race across town to find him or her) it rarely inspires a fed-up eye roll. The expression it engenders is more of a quizzical knit brow. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. What exactly is director and screenwriter Edward Zwick--co-creator of thirtysomethingand My So-Called Life whose last film was the WWII thriller Defiance--up to in this combination love story/medical drama/Big Pharma satire/raunchy sex comedy? Careening from bathos to bromance to naked sexytime the movie is like a mashup of three or four different movies at least two of them fairly unpleasant. And yet Love and Other Drugs is so sincere and unjaded about its mystifying purpose that it keeps our gaze fixed on the screen for the full two hours. Or maybe thats just Anne Hathaways nude body. Advertisement Hathaways body is a perfectly acceptable reason to plunk down a ten-spot for this movie. Not only is it gorgeous--in a lanky-yet-voluptuous way you would probably never have guessed without the er access this movie provides--but Hathaways face engages the camera like nobodys since early Julia Roberts. (Hathaway doesnt particularly resemble Roberts but they share a toothiness and a luminescence.) The movies attitude toward nudity is almost European in its casualness In Hathaways first scene she undergoes a breast exam and just when you expect the camera to cut away demurely--pop She yanks up her shirt and gives both doctor and audience a peek. The movies unprurient randiness is one of its more lovable qualities; unlike most Hollywood films about two people falling in love it acknowledges how big a part plain old-fashioned good sex plays in the process. Good sex is especially important for the protagonists of Love and Other Drugs because its one of their few ways of connecting successfully with other humans. Neither Jamie Randall (Jake Gyllenhaal) nor Maggie Murdock (Hathaway) is your typical please-love-me rom-com character. Jamie is a fast-talking sales rep for Pfizer. Its the mid-90s and Jamies days are spent pestering doctors to start prescribing Zoloft rather than Prozac as their antidepressant of choice. (The movies portrait of the pharmaceutical industry is loosely based on a nonfiction book by a former Pfizer rep.) Hes not having a lot of luck with the doctors but hes cleaning up with their female receptionists and nurses--apparently all Jamie has to do is buy a woman flowers and ply her with patently insincere pickup lines and she vaults into his bed. Jamies slick charm is shown to us right from the opening scene as a transparently fake cover-up for his ambition and greed. Hes not a bad guy at heart but hes clearly damaged and not in an appealing puppy-dog way. Hathaways Maggie also departs from the rom-com template of niceness Shes sexually aggressive dirty-mouthed reflexively sarcastic and often self-pitying. Granted Maggie has good reason to feel sorry for herself At 26 shes been diagnosed with early-onset Parkinsons and shes staring down an unknown future that could include dementia and paralysis. When she meets Jamie at her doctors office she winds up in bed with him because she recognizes him as a kindred spirit a fellow commitment-averse slut. And thats exactly the relationship they pursue shagging Fatal Attraction-style against the kitchen sink and then repairing to their separate apartments until Maggies sickness gets worse and they begin to their mutual horror to care about one another. But wait Then Viagra is invented--wed be in 1998 now--and the movie shifts gears into raucous sex comedy as Jamie becomes an overnight success a high-living enabler of orgy enthusiasts and lubricious doctors (one of them played by an underused Hank Azaria). Oh and Maggie attends a meeting of an advocacy group for Parkinsons patients and is inspired by the many high-functioning people she meets. Are we supposed to shed a tear for the sick girl cheer on the activists or laugh at the guy with a four-hour erection? In a way its to Zwicks credit that he expects us to have all three feelings and a few others besides. In its best moments Love and Other Drugs can have a James L. Brooksian amplitude of spirit. Unfortunately there are long stretches in between when the movie just feels glib sprawling and confused. Advertisement Though their characters are drawn in richer detail than your usual Hollywood cutouts Jamie and Maggie dont make that much sense either together or apart. If Maggie really is as disgusted by the pharmaceutical industry as she claims why does she cheer Jamie on as he makes a killing on the Viagra craze? Why do we learn virtually nothing about Maggies family while Jamie gets a whole scene with his clan? (His family is headed up by the late Jill Clayburgh who appears looking heartbreakingly lovely as his mother in an early scene.) How come Oliver Platt appears once every 20 minutes as a character were supposed to care about but never gets a moment to establish his backstory? Looking back on Love and Other Drugs Im not even sure whether I can recommend it or not. It contains some ""get me out of here"" moments many of them involving the character of Jamies fat nerdy brother (Josh Gad) but it also packs some powerful scenes between Hathaway and Gyllenhaal. Hathaways performance is the showier one--she gets the trembling hands and the emotional breakdowns--but Gyllenhaals is in its way more impressive since he has the tougher job of turning an initially repellent character into a credible romantic hero. Is there anyone out there who remembers Edward Zwicks first feature film About Last Night... (1986)? It was a loose adaptation of a David Mamet play in which Rob Lowe and Demi Moore just grown out of their St. Elmos phase played a pair of hard-partying young adults in Chicago who took a long time to realize that beneath their veneer of studied indifference they actually were made for each other. Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins played their loyal wisecracking seconds (and were both completely great--possibly the only time Ive loved Jim Belushi in a role). Though Im sure it would look corny and dated in retrospect I have curiously fond memories of About Last Night... which like this movie is about two very specific and not always admirable characters falling reluctantly in love.

More information onthese and other AFI films can be found at afi.com/afifest.CRITICS PICK  13 ASSASSINS Takashi Miike the most prolifically gonzo filmmaker in Japan (and quite possibly the world) finally decides to sell out in high style -- and turns in his most impressive effort since 1999s Audition. With the exception of one memorably nightmarish moment involving a nude limbless woman writhing in permanent agony 13 Assassins is just a straightforward expertly choreographed samurai action flick albeit with an atypical emphasis on the physical demands of the profession and a healthy disregard for its fabled code of honor. Setups a bit pokey as is often the case with Miike but the entire second half of the movie is one long kickass battle sequence at once kinetically thrilling in the Kurosawa/Kobayashi tradition and as goofily absurdist -- flaming oxen booby-trapped buildings -- as something out of Jeunet amp; Caro. Makes you wonder what Miike might accomplish if he settled down and made just one film a year rather than his usual half-assed three or four. (MD) (Nov. 7 930 p.m. Chinese)AARDVARK A blind guy walks out of an AA meeting and into a martial arts studio. Cinematographer Kitao Sakurais debut as a writer-director stars nonactors Darren Branch and Larry Lewis whose real-life relationship as a blind recovering alcoholic and his jiujitsu instructor is the basis for Aardvarks first half an exploration of sensation and physicality rich with character detail and boldly loose on plot. Then Darrens secret life of crime catches up with him and Aardvark turns into a full-on noir of all-too-literal blind justice. Narratively its one joke (blind guys gets a lap dance; blind guy requests verbal confirmation that hes holding the right person at gunpoint) but stylistically its a knockout with a final quasi-action sequence that bridges the films opposing tonal tendencies Euro-art slowness and low-budg high-gimmick revenge flick. (KL) (Nov. 5 7 p.m. Chinese)AMIGO For a brief period in the 1990s John Sayles achieved a truly miraculous amalgam of lefty political activism and thorny impassioned human drama. Since peaking with Lone Star (1996) however hes become increasingly bogged down in dreary righteousness. Set during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century Amigo means to use this forgotten chapter of history to make pointed statements about our current adventures in the Middle East. Trouble is it does so entirely via earnest platitudes and schematic irony. Somebody needs to stand over Sayles shoulder at the keyboard and just slap him hard in the face every time he types the word ""American."" Seriously. Even Chris Cooper who made his name in Sayles early pictures is unable to offer a morsel of genuine behavior.

Sep. 13 600pm BLACK SWAN Both self-conscious homage to epic backstage soaps and visceral body-dysmorphia horror Black Swan stars Natalie Portman as Nina a ballerina torn between fear and ambition. Nina bests both the ballets aging star (Winona Ryder) and its new sexpot diva (Mila Kunis) to land the lead in her companys reimagining of Swan Lake but the casting is contingent on Nina learning to embrace her own ""evil twin."" Vivid hallucinations -- or are they?? -- ensue involving bi-curiosity hysteric violence self-harm and self-preservation. A riff on diva cinemas greatest hits Black Swan is Suspiria with less style All About Eve but all about orgasm panic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? with Ryder and Barbara Hershey (as Ninas infantilizing mom) splitting the Bette Davis role. Call it balletsploitation Its a work of art only in that its pitch-perfect trash. (KL) (Nov. 1 730 p.m. Chinese)BLUE VALENTINE Derek Cianfrances Sundance hit crosscuts the first and last days of the relationship between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) young class-crossed lovers turned unhappily harried marrieds. A naturalistic (and fatalist) antiromance that acknowledges the evanescence of mutual adoration performed by vanity-free actors and presented in grainy deeply saturated imagery that always goes for the painterly over the descriptive Blue Valentine is surface-oriented to a fault. Williams translates Cindys coldness into blankness and Cianfrances camera keeps getting closer to her as if her pores were windows to her soul. But the final scene crescendos superlatively. Inexplicably rated NC-17 by the MPAA Valentine is adult in theme but whats on-screen is relatively chaste. (KL) (Nov. 6 630 p.m. Chinese)BARNEYS VERSION Paul Giamatti stars in this adaptation of Mordecai Richlers sprawling 1997 novel about the life and loves of the titular schlub a narcissistic romantic who drinks his way from bohemian decadence to bourgeois autopilot to angry foggy old age. Highlights of the 40 years sped through in two-plus hours include the mysterious death of his best friend Boogie (Scott Speedman) two unhappy marriages and one great romance with Rosamund Pikes Miriam. The performances are uneven (Minnie Drivers Canadian Jew accent is the worst and Speedman often seems to be lost looking for the rhythm of his lines even before Boogie turns into a junkie) but the central relationship drama is super compelling. Slip it in the A Man and His Mortality genre above the soggy pabulum of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button but Barneys Version never approaches the transcendence of the narratively similar Synecdoche New York. (KL) (Nov. 6 8 p.m. Egyptian) CARGO Stranded-in-space thrillers need something going on when the suspense isnt cooking even if its just doom-chic design like Alien or more recently a head-scratcher concept as in Moon. Ivan Englers calling-card feature about a carrier ship with a mystery load lumbers through bump-in-the-night whodunit for ages without getting its hooks in and theres little in the filmmaking to tide us over between the plot dumps periodically delivered by a mutually suspicious crew. A virtual-reality complication comes as no surprise though it might as well have emerged earlier. But our naive proxy a medic (Anna-Katharina Schwabroh) jobbing for cash to join her sister on a paradise planet has a certain guileless bland appeal. (NR) (Nov. 5 645 p.m. Chinese)CASINO JACK The final film from director George Hickenlooper (Hearts of Darkness Factory Girl) who passed away suddenly last weekend Casino Jack is an overslick telepic-esque telling of the long fall of Jack Abramoff. (Over)played by Kevin Spacey the once-untouchable ""superlobbyist"" who played clients and politicians against each other for his own personal gain is given a fairly sympathetic gloss He may be predatory and delusional but hes also an American Everyman whose key mistake was staying drunk on Clinton-era economic optimism too long only to be abandoned by the government officials who he thought had his back. Its fast-paced and stylish but the performances are flat caricatures and the script is laughably on-the-nose. ""This isnt the 90s anymore"" someone actually says. ""Its post-9/11"" Spaceys sporadic narration is even worse. (KL) (Nov. 8 7 p.m. Chinese)CERTIFIED COPY Abbas Kiarostamis shape-shifter follows Elle (Juliette Binoche) and James (William Shimell) over an afternoons worth of rural Italian countryside sparring. Initially Elle just wants to argue with James about his new book which posits that in art fake can be just as good as real. But when a cafe proprietor mistakes them for a married couple and Elle starts arguing with her new ""husband"" their debate on truths value takes on a new dimension of (real?) emotional pain. Whats happening here? Is this a married couple playing a game to revitalize their marriage two bored intellectuals sparring for stakes or just all-out epistemological allegory? Firm answers are unlikely (as hinted by a cameo from Bunuel screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere) but the films hypnotic regardless with two irritably virtuoso performances and gorgeous mise-en-scene elevated way above tourist porn. (VR) (Nov. 7 615 p.m. Chinese)THE COMPANY MEN In a quietly meta performance nodding at his own career seesaw Ben Affleck plays Bobby a cocky young salesman downsized and forced to give up his home/Porsche/pride before returning to the workforce with humbled expectations. Writer-director John Wells experience shaping ensemble TV hits like ER shows in Mens generous-to-a-fault intertwining of story lines featuring the mid-to-late-life crises of Bobbys former superiors (Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper both excellent). Men was purchased by the Weinstein Company after Sundance and given a cut and polish to bring all of its latent feel-good potential to the surface. Its sunshiney music cues and sudden happy ending make it tough to take seriously as a portrait of our still-unfolding economic catastrophe but as an exploration of the relationship between money and masculinity its pretty fascinating. (KL) (Nov. 10 730 p.m. Chinese)FREE RADICALS ""Id like you to meet my friends"" begins Pip Chodorovs voice-over to his avant-garde film documentary which tributes professional collegiality and artistic method without getting too chummy or strident. Radicals sketches the work and driving ethos of a few filmmakers from both sides of the Atlantic pioneer Hans Richter dazzling innovator Len Lye and a candid Methuselean Bob Breer. Also here are the usual suspects New York avant house Anthology Film Archives and indefatigable godfather Jonas Mekas Ken Jacobs (in leaner days eating spareribs from the trash) Peter Kubelka (explaining metric editing) and in his final interview before his 2003 death acknowledged master Stan Brakhage. With no intention of comprehensiveness its a film of homemade elegance not unlike the personal cinema that is among its subjects. (NR) (Nov. 5 645 p.m. Chinese)HAHAHA The more superficially entertaining of Hong Sang-soos two films this year (Okis Movie also is at AFI; see below) this Cannes Un Certain Regard prizewinner constructs a drunken (natch) ping-pong match between two old friends who take turns regaling each other with anecdotes about their recent trips to the same city unaware that their paths nearly crossed multiple times and theyre frequently talking about identical incidents as seen from slightly different angles. The idea seems to cry out for farce but Hong bless him sticks stubbornly to his own bemused brand of quasi-comedy with consistently enjoyable if ultimately weightless results. As usual the best recurring gag is structural Each present-day interlude depicted only in stills and voice-over concludes with a toast; we hear their glasses clink so many times that its a wonder the movies epilogue doesnt take place in an emergency ward. (MD) (Nov. 6 2 p.m. Chinese) HEARTBEATS Like most young filmmakers 21-year-old Xavier Dolan wears his influences on his sleeve but at least he worships the right people early Godard Wong Kar-wai Woody Allen at his most formally inventive. Heartbeats isnt nearly as personal or heartfelt as Dolans debut I Killed My Mother (still unreleased in the U.S.) but it confirms him as a natural-born filmmaker poised to be the French-Canadian P.T. Anderson once he too manages to synthesize a style of his own. From a narrative standpoint this romantic triangle is a threadbare tale of unrequited love and surly rivalry but watching Dolan enthusiastically explore the mediums lush seductive expressionistic possibilities feels like gulping your fill at a watering hole in the middle of contemporary art cinemas New Austerity. (MD) (Nov. 7 7 p.m. Chinese)I WILL FOLLOW As a grieving woman (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) packs up the house of her late aunt in a single day shes visited by a dozen different people -- movers family friends -- who trigger tears comic relief and life-changing realizations. Aptly described by writer-director Ava Duvernay as a ""mood piece"" the film is deceptively simple as it gracefully cycles through its palette of emotions. (The aunts backstory serves subtle commentary on the limits imposed by race and gender; she was a session musician renowned for disco work while dreaming of being in a rock band.) The entire ensemble is solid but Michole White as the angrily grieving daughter is exceptional. (EH) (Nov. 5 9 p.m. Egyptian)THE KINGS SPEECH The common fear of public speaking and the uncommon circumstance of being the king of England come together in this delightful example of just how enjoyable the biopic genre can be. Colin Firth breathes charm as George VI who won the title after his spoiled-rotten brother Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) abdicated to marry the woman he loved. As Hitler had invaded Poland George was required to speak but was paralyzed by a stammer hed had since youth. Enter the very unorthodox speech teacher Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Rush hams soulfully. Helena Bonham Carter likewise has a fine old time as Georges wife later known and much-beloved as the Queen Mum. (DE) (Nov. 5 730 p.m. Chinese)LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS Anne Hathaway bares her breasts in Edward Zwicks rom-dramedy frequently and casually and with the confidence of a one-time Oscar nominee who knows that a role in which her romantic viability is undercut by a debilitating disease is a pretty sure shot at nomination No. 2. Should you decide that you cannot wait for the screen grabs to make it to Mr. Skin be forewarned that Love and Other Drugs an unfunny sex farce and a relationship study without a shred of genuine human behavior also includes the following period-defining montages set to both Spin Doctors and ""Macarena""; an Inconvenient Boner set piece forcing Jake Gyllenhaal to scamper across several frames holding a pillow in front of his pelvis; a pull-over-on-the-highway make-up-cute; and a sex scene in which an orgasm evolves into a Parkinsons tremor -- or maybe even more tastelessly vice versa? Ask yourself Is it worth it? (KL) (Nov. 4 730 p.m. Chinese)MADE IN DAGENHAM The 187 female machinists at Dagenhams Ford factory plant assembled car-seat upholstery by hand without a template; Nigel Coles blandly inspirational recap of their 1968 strike though is strictly prefab. Thrill to the preordained beats as Rita OGrady (Sally Hawkins) overcomes her natural timidity and unfortunate haircut to demand equal pay. She also teaches her husband (Daniel Mays) that its her right not to get beaten; he gratefully agrees and sexism is eradicated forever. Youve seen this before After an initial euphoric burst the strike gets rough and everyone hates Rita until she wins everything. Both dour and lazy the fictionalized saga is undercut by grainy archival footage of the actual plant and the real ladies shamefully relegated to a token minutes reminiscence over the end credits. (VR) (Nov. 8 8 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  THE MYTH OF THE AMERICAN SLEEPOVER First-time director David Robert Mitchell has collected a remarkable group of kids for his slightly clumsy but hugely endearing high school nostalgia piece which plays like a gentler sweeter essentially timeless version of Dazed and Confused. Scattered across a neighborhoods worth of summer parties hangouts and yes sleepovers various Michigan teens bounce from one awkward flirtation to the next constantly mindful of their place in the hierarchy and forever uncertain whether to choose caution or adventure. That tenuous sense of push-pull is the heart of the movie which starts off ungainly but slowly grows into a modest gossamer joy. (MD) (Nov. 9 7 p.m. Chinese) NOTHINGS ALL BAD A neurotic exhibitionist pervert and his gorgeous gigolo son; a lonely sexually repressed widow and her mastectomied daughter. Around these four begging-for-analysis individuals writer-director Mikkel Munch-Fals crafts his first feature Nothings All Bad a yarn of depravity dysfunction and absurd coincidences. Munch-Fals is a major critic in the Danish film community but his writing here would suggest that his viewing is limited to works from the ongoing cycle of melodramas wallowing in the seedy underbelly of suburban America (Solondz Field Jenkins Mendes) but his directing brings in ideas about space from Antonioni and color from Fassbinders reading of Sirk and shows a true critics sensibility by playing out the incredibly silly climax exclusively in knowing looks -- at once a triumph of physical performance and an acknowledgment of his films failure. (PC) (Nov. 9 945 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  OKIS MOVIE Its a pity that Hong Sang-soos movies come and go in the States so swiftly especially since his latest might be his most accomplished yet. Set at a film school seemingly plagued by bad ideas -- romantic and professional -- four nested stories play out affairs of the heart that unexpectedly cut to the quick among them the comic misadventures of a pompous young director. His off-balance Rohmeresque encounters and another students musings on two boyfriends of very different ages are the highlights of the film which also delivers Hongs comic specialty scenes of drunken mortification that feel like ones most bumbling what-if daydreams thrown on-screen. (This time its the young directors post-screening Qamp;A which hilariously falls under the category of ""worst-case scenario."") The abrupt daisy-chaining of the characters lives and their personal films keeps you on your toes but its all in the service of drawing out intimately felt insights. (NR) (Nov. 6 415 p.m. Chinese)OUTRAGE After a few years spent indulging himself with goofy self-referential postmodern ""comedies"" -- you really have to see 2007s insane Glory to the Filmmaker to believe it -- Takeshi Kitano returns to the ultraviolent yakuza genre that made his reputation. Alas his heart doesnt seem to be in it anymore. Where his earlier films walked an arresting line between brutality and tenderness Outrage seems content to merely serve up gruesome carnage a la carte gradually excising various body parts until the films entire sprawling ensemble cast is dead horribly mutilated or (usually) both. For a while the sheer absurdity of this over-the-top spectacle makes for fine black comedy but well before the finale Kitanos empty parade of functionally anonymous butchery becomes monotonous numbing even dull. Hes reached an aesthetic dead end. (MD) (Nov. 8 915 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  PINK SARIS Veteran British documentarian Kim Longinotto makes portraits of strong women who lay down the law -- or just throw down. Rural Indian womens rights advocate Sampat Pal Devi probably could do either Shes like a frontier sheriff as she settles disputes and leaves men dumbstruck in her wake. Bride beatings Romeo-and-Juliet romances and other village affairs are settled in the open; she turns shame back against male wrongdoers and teaches girls respect. Sampat is savvy about her public on a small scale (a typical rousing one-liner ""This mans an idiot. Thats all there is to it"") and on the media stage The title refers to the dazzlingly dressed gang of supporters she convenes for protests. But instead of belting out a girl-power anthem Longinotto also shows Sampats own deeply wounded private side in a wrenching wind-down. (NR) (Nov. 9 710 p.m. Chinese)POETRY Lee Chang-dongs latest feature won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes this year but like his equally acclaimed Secret Sunshine Poetry throws a bunch of tonally disparate elements together and dares you to assemble them into something coherent -- an approach easily mistaken for profundity. Yun Jung-hee is a marvel as Mija an elderly woman who impulsively signs up for a poetry class and struggles to find inspiration in everyday beauty. Her distractions include in no particular order a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease which has begun to plunder her memory; negotiating a financial settlement to compensate the family of a young girl who committed suicide after being gang-raped by a group of school bullies including Mijas grandson; and an old man with cerebral palsy for whom Mija cares who keeps demanding a mercy fuck from her. How does this all fit together? Thats the poetry I guess. (MD) (Nov. 10 645 p.m. Chinese) PRECIOUS LIFE The story of a poor family from Gaza whose desperately ill son receives treatment in an Israeli hospital by a politically progressive Jewish doctor Life may be another documentary celebrating life-affirming instances of Israeli/Palestinian cooperation but its elevated above the pack by its powerful illustration of the difficulty humans can have assimilating information that defies stereotype and expectation. A hospital scene between the films director Shlomi Eldar (a respected reporter/activist) and the childs mother is excruciatingly tense as it captures such a moment while planting seeds for epiphanies -- joyful and painful -- to come. (EH) (Nov. 6 930 p.m. Chinese)THE PRINCESS OF MONTPENSIER Bertrand Taverniers handsome but painfully dull costume drama adapted from a 1662 novel by Madame de La Fayette opens with one of those historical-context scrolls that Monty Python justly attempted to kill decades ago. (""1568. It is a time of great strife in Europe. Le blah blah blah."") Pretty but bland Melanie Thierry plays the title role swooning over the hunky Gaspard Ulliel while fending off the respectfully amorous advances of various other incarnations of Gallic masculinity including Lambert Wilson as her tutor and Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet as the earnest husband to whom shes been brokered. The film is scrupulously accurate immaculately designed ably acted highly intelligent. All its missing really is even a microscopic hint of the wit and fire that say Jacques Rivette brought to his magnificent The Duchess of Langeais. Bring a date if you want to ensure that they refuse to see anything but Jackass and Saw sequels from that day forward. (MD) (Nov. 6 315 p.m. Chinese)PULSAR Samuels lovely live-in girlfriend Mireille takes an internship in New York leaving him alone in Brussels pining and progressively dependent on the feeder pedals of Skype chat and e-mail. Distance leads to insecurity leads to paranoia and Samuel soon becomes convinced that someone has hacked into his wi-fi network preventing him from getting online and even impersonating him in correspondence with Mireille. Pulsar is directed by Alex Stockman a Belgian film critic-turned-filmmaker and ambiguity is its best asset As Samuel slips deeper into delusion the film becomes increasingly enigmatic in structure and its final few minutes are puzzling in the best way. But Stockman never solves the inherent problem of his material It is boring to watch people send and receive e-mails. (KL) (Nov. 6 4 p.m. Chinese)PUTTY HILL A skate-park junkie overdoses in an impoverished Baltimore suburb uniting family and friends at the young mans wake to sing heartfelt karaoke in a shabby wood-paneled hall. This vaguely Big Chill-esque narrative is mainly a device to connect the lived-in moments within writer-director Matthew Porterfields impressionistic follow-up to Hamilton which takes a slackly structured amble through the prefuneral lives and rituals of its fringe ensemble -- tattoo artists teenage girls elderly homebodies and other sympathetic souls all played by nonprofessional locals. Evocative sound design and heart-rate-lowering long takes accentuate the titular districts moody milieu of wooded lakes abandoned houses and paintball fields (gorgeously shot by Murder Party director Jeremy Saulnier) punctuated by Porterfields off-camera interviews of his ""characters"" -- an ambitious sporadically seamless integration of documentary methods. As a communal portrait the naturalistic rigor doesnt always ring true. But as a no-budget American indie swimming in a sea of navel-gazing mediocrity Putty Hill is downright inspiring. (AH) (Nov. 5 930 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  RUBBER ""All great films contain an important element of No Reason"" declares a key character in Rubbers pre-credits prologue. ""The movie youre about to see is an homage to No Reason."" A bizarro genre-bender in which a tire with inexplicable motor skills and psychokinetic powers goes on a killing spree Rubber twins its synth-suspense-scored violence with a parallel plotline about the increasingly desperate fates of a band of tourists who have been carted out to the desert to watch the tires exploits through binoculars. Director Quentin Dupieux indulges in genre conventions while skewering them; the voyeurs get whats coming to them but the final images confirm that Hollywood is his real target. A masterpiece of absurdist horror aesthetically inspired in equal parts by When Inanimate Objects Attack schlock and the epic desert impressionism of Zabriskie Point Rubber is the must-see film of the festival. (KL) (Nov. 5 9 p.m. Chinese)LE QUATTRO VOLTE Michelangelo Frammartinos droll picturesque look at an Italian country hamlet is a bit like an old-fashioned childrens book drinking in a shepherds routine a goats shenanigans the hubbub of a harvest celebration. Bearing the burden of praise from multiple international film festivals the film draws on the approved wait-and-see style but Frammartino doesnt just want to ennoble man and beast -- he has a bit of a sense of humor and hes clearly got Jacques Tati and Otar Iosselliani on his mind. So yes the old shepherd will make his labored way down a shady forest path representing the passing of one age of man but theres also a series of orchestrated comic set pieces at a village crossroads -- presided over by a hectoring dog host to a ramshackle Catholic procession in clattering Roman dress and ill-advised parking spot for a truck wheel-anchored by a single cobblestone. (NR) (Nov. 9 430 p.m.) RABBIT HOLE An adaptation of David Lindsay-Abaires play about a couple torn apart by the grieving process following the accidental death of their only child Rabbit Hole is precisely the sort of prestige item Hollywood used to regularly turn out; the fact that its a smaller-scaled indie is one indication of how times have changed. Doing a 180 from his sexually cutting-edge past (Hedwig and the Angry Inch Shortbus) director John Cameron Mitchell has a real feel for actors and he brings the very best out of the preternaturally chilly Nicole Kidman as a woman so discombobulated by tragedy that she seeks to form a friendship with the young man who inadvertently killed her son. Aaron Eckhart comes through solidly as well in a seemingly simple drama that leaves a subtle emotional aftertaste. (DE) (Nov. 7 8 p.m. Egyptian)A SCREAMING MAN If you believe that a father in Chad would sell his son to the army in order to regain his position as a pool attendant -- not because hes been fired but because hes been ""demoted"" to a position guarding the hotel gate with the son replacing him poolside -- then you might agree with this years Cannes jury which awarded A Screaming Man its equivalent of third prize. Director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun has a keen eye for wide-screen composition but he leans ridiculously hard on the weathered visage of his impassive lead actor slowly tracking into his sorrowful face whenever he thinks the film needs a shot of emotion. Worthiness only gets you so far and its hard not to imagine how much more urgent and purposeful this scenario might have been in the hands of say the Dardennes. (MD) (Nov. 6 7 p.m. Chinese)SHIT YEAR Cam Archers elliptical surreal story of a fucked-up year in the life of an aging actress embodies the stereotypes that come to mind for folks who loathe art-house fare. Shot in black-and-white (which beautifully compliments Ellen Barkin in the lead role) the film is filled with close-ups on faces and body parts cuts to therapist sessions in sci-fi-like environs meandering voice-overs and leaps back and forth across the time line. Barkin is great as the searching bitchy lead and small parts afford underused actresses like Theresa Randle and Melora Walters some camera time but this tale and its characters might have been better served by more conventional storytelling. (EH) (Nov. 6 645 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  TWO GATES OF SLEEP Writer-director Alistair Banks Griffins meditative gorgeously poetic film has already been both heralded as a nod to Terrence Malick and labeled an exercise in tedium. The story of two poor rural brothers who must overcome all manner of obstacles to honor their late mothers wishes for her burial the film is absolutely measured filled with long takes while being largely void of dialogue. Its also filled with visuals that telegraph volumes about the lives of its characters -- the weathered ramshackle house they live in; the burned-out ruins of their old home to which their mother is repeatedly drawn before dying; the close-ups of a deer being skinned and gutted. The film gives a condescension-free clear-eyed look at poverty and struggle that befits characters who stoically face lifes harshness and bleakness head-on with their own brand of grace. (EH) (Nov. 6 1 p.m. Chinese)CRITICS PICK  UNCLE BOONMEE WHO CAN RECALL HIS PAST LIVES Even before the first image the sound of a forest resting at night -- chirping the rustling of branches and a barely perceptible wind -- confirms were firmly in Apichatpong ""Joe"" Weerasethakuls Thailand. Kubrick needed the whole universe to symbolically depict birth and resurrection; for his tale of a dying mans last days all Joe needs is some natural lighting trees and a cave. The inexplicable is regular terrain for him his grandiosity tempered by a gentle restraint thats hypnotic rather than cloyingly twee. Dont worry about why men are showing up reborn as monkeys or catfish are ... well youll see. It all will make intuitive sense. Just as his protagonists have many lives Joe too seems to be saying goodbye and gearing up for another reincarnation. In the meantime this is his most linear incident-filled work yet making a perfect introduction for beginners.

Love and Other Drugs Fair Director Edward Zwick. Cast Jake Gyllenhall Anne Hathaway Oliver Platt. Rating R for strong sexual content nudity pervasive language and drug material. Spotlight Jake Gyllenhaal | Anne Hathaway Director Ed Zwick turns to rom-com Lets take ""Love and Other Drugs"" for instance which might well have been called ""Sex Jokes and the Occasional TV-Movie-Level Drama."" OK so maybe theres a reason people do this for a living - people who arent me. But you cant argue with the accuracy of that description of director Edward Zwicks film set in the mid-90s about a salesman (Jake Gyllenhaal) with standard-issue commitment issues and a woman (Anne Hathaway) suffering from health problems. The movie jumps back and forth so much between an adult romantic comedy (think lots of sex and nudity) and Serious Illness Issues (melodrama for the most part) that perhaps audiences are lucky not to be charged for two movies. Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal) is a glib handsome rascal traits that combine to make him the perfect salesman if not the perfect person. After getting bounced from his job as a stereo salesman for ahem extracurricular activities Jamie on the advice of his brother Josh (Josh Gad) gives pharmaceutical sales a try. Naturally hes good at it pushing Zoloft on doctors offices schmoozing with and occasionally sleeping with the staff. It seems like the perfect job for him - until the introduction of Viagra which turns out to be even more perfect. Along the way while pretending to be an intern for a sleazy doctor (Hank Azaria born to it) he meets Maggie Murdock (Hathaway) a free spirit who wants sex and no commitments which is fine by Jamie since he seems constitutionally incapable of it. But there is a reason for Maggies reluctance she has early onset Parkinsons disease and fears becoming a burden on anyone. Another element thus introduced this is when the film starts losing its focus. Based loosely on Jamie Reidys memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" Zwick cant seem to decide what the movie is - a refreshingly frank comedy about sex and commitment or a more-serious look at illness and its effect on relationships. He aims for both and doesnt quite hit either mark. There are some real laughs though most dont involve Josh who despite being an Internet millionaire lives in Jamies apartment. (Even Jamie asks at one point youre rich why do you live here?) The best marriage of comedy and emotion actually comes courtesy of Oliver Platt as Jamies less-successful colleague whose self-deprecation doesnt quite mask his real hurt though its not for lack of trying. The resolution of Jamie and Maggies relationship is far more predictable in the last act which is too bad because Gyllenhaal and Hathaway who played a couple in ""Brokeback Mountain"" have a natural likable chemistry. At least when its allowed to shine. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goody.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 21 2010 ShareThis (Photo Laurie Sparham/The Weinstein Company) With his pursed lips and edgy rectitude Colin Firth is ideally cast as an uptight fellow in serious need of therapy in the middlebrow masterpiece The Kings Speech. The uptight fellow is Albert Frederick Arthur George better known as King George VI father of Elizabeth II and the therapy is for a crippling stammer. But its a stammer with strong psychological (not to mention commercial) overtones. The therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) is both a commoner and a foreigner who insists on flouting protocol and addressing his royal client as Bertie. He doesnt want to focus on the larynx or diaphragm. He wants to know when and how the stammer began. He wants to know about childhood traumas. Logue is Australian but its easy to imagine that hes AustrianFreud-trained and Jewishand here to administer an emotional enema to purge this Uber-Wasp of Waspishness. No wonder Harvey Weinstein thinks he hasding-dingthe years Best Picture. He just might. The Kings Speech has a cunning crowd-pleasing shape. It opens in 1925 when its protagonist now the Duke of York addressesor attempts to addressa crowd at Wembley Stadium and can barely get out two words in succession. The newfangled microphone the wireless radio These are not his friends. The movie closes a decade and a half later on the eve of war with Hitlers Germany the sky over London speckled with barrage balloons the nation waiting anxiously for a speech by its king over the airwaves. Have the psychic clots been loosened? Can this man who was shamed into tremulous childlike obedience by his overbearing father George V (Michael Gambon)forced to wear splints to correct his knock-knees and to write with his right hand to correct for left-handednessnow project unwavering patriarchal authority? We along with the kings subjects hang on every measured syllable. The 73-year-old screenwriter David Seidler reportedly had a stammer in his youth and read avidly about George VI but he waited until the kings wife (a.k.a. the Queen Mother) died at age 101 before going public with his Oedipal take on Georges journey to (relative) fluency. Seidler and director Tom Hooper (HBOs John Adams) wisely play the relationship between the king and his therapist as a prickly comedy of manners. Rush wears roomy suits and opposite Firth in his invisible corset has a way of looking disheveled even when hes all spruced up. Plopping himself down on the throne in Westminster daring the outraged George to have him hauled off to the Tower Logue is the therapist as court jester. The goal is provocation to get the king to sputter and then vent and then curse with dismaying fluidity. There is one final element of suspense Will lowly Logue lumber back to his Harley Street den unheralded? Or will King George VI although possessed of the divine snobbery of kings be moved to recognize his shabby therapist as a friend? Its a prizewinning combination terribly English and totally Hollywood and Firth is once more uncanny He evokes in mid-stammer existential dread. I do have quibbles some of them large enough to border on being issues. Its hard to accept Guy Pearce who plays King Edward the abdicator as Firths older brother He looks acts and is almost a decade Firths junior. Timothy Spalls Winston Churchill is a splendid impersonationof Alfred Hitchcock. Id have treasured even more scenes with Helena Bonham Carters Elizabeth (the Queen Mum) that rare blue blood who hasnt had the life force bred out of her. More seriously the directors style is often as constipated as his leading mans Hooper cuts back and forth between a character on the far left of the screen and one on the far right as if hed got his drama degree at Wimbledon. One last issue While the address to which The Kings Speech builds was of some symbolic importance (although not as much as Georges decision to keep his family in London in harms way) it seems I dont know wrong to feel so flush and happy and relieved when after all is said (without stammering) and done the country is on the brink of blitzkrieg. This is the sort of sleight-of-hand that bolsters the case against Hollywood which trivializes history for the sake of bogus scenarios of self-realization. Its also a sleight-of-hand that wins Oscars. Check out Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway on the cover of Entertainment Weekly looking nekkid nekkid nekkida great come-on for Love amp; Other Drugs and not even false advertising. In the movie he is nekkid and she is even nekkider and they are very beautiful together in the nekkidness. The movies first half is a state-of-the-art Zeitgeist sex comedy even if its set in 1996. It was morning in our brave new psychopharmacological world and Big Pharma salesdude Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal) is at its hub sweet-talking (and more or less bribing) physicians (and receptionists) into prescribing his SSRI (Zoloft) over an even slicker rival companys (Prozac). Hes such a supple smooth-faced blue-eyed cutie that his transparently fake ingenuousness is more winning than other peoples genuine ingenuousness. And when word percolates up that his company has found the Holy Grail the fuck drug and called it Viagra he really has the world by its gonads. Even better hes seeing gorgeous artist Maggie Murdock (Hathaway) with her dark eyes and swarm of dark ringlets and insatiable compulsion to get nekkid with him and then kick him out Shell be disappointed she says if it turns out hes not a shithead and wants to commit. 1 2 Next Share this story...

TWITTER Edward Zwicks ""Love and Other Drugs"" an offbeat romantic drama set in the world of pharmaceutical sales plays at times like a patient who has gone off his meds. The energy is far too great -- manic even -- at the beginning but calms down for a while to focus on the highly competitive but not always ethical arena of drug sales then gets distracted by unusually bold sex scenes for a studio picture only to wander off into the cultural phenomenon of Viagra before the movie decides its a romance after all and so concludes in a highly conventional final embrace. The movies got ADD like you wouldnt believe. At its core ""Love and Other Drugs"" has solid romance credentials and two very photogenic leads in the at times scarcely clothed Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. So the film should gain box-office traction when it opens Thanksgiving weekend with young adults as its primary draw. Perhaps the problem stems from the films development process. Writer-producer Charles Randolph pitched a project based on the nonfiction book ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" by Jamie Reidy about a hot-shot Pfizer salesman navigating the pharmaceutical industry of the late 90s. Eventually Zwick and his longtime writing/producing partner Marshall Herskovitz came aboard to create an interesting case of sexual combustion between a healthy yet emotionally constricted man and a woman with medical challenges. The world of the film could just as easily have been Wall Street a fashion magazine or life on the road firing people to evoke a few recent movies. Yet the pharmaceutical business proves too new to films for Zwick a filmmaker who is really interested in how things tick to resist a deep plunge into unfamiliar territory. So the life of a drug salesman nearly swamps his love story. But it doesnt at least not entirely. Gyllenhaals Jamie Randall is a born salesmen and seducer first seen charming patrons preferably women at an electronics store in 1996. However his inability to keep his pants zipped loses this job for him. Coming to his rescue is his rich geek brother played by Josh Gad in a role that runs throughout the movie but is never necessary other than delivering a few gross-out moments in a misguided attempt to attract male teens. The younger brother guides him into a training program and eventually a job at Pfizer which relocates him to an Eastern city as a drug rep working under a veteran salesman (Oliver Platt). (The movie was shot in Pittsburgh.) In his charm-and-guile siege of Dr. Knights (Hank Azaria) medical office Jamie encounters a patient Maggie Murdock (Hathaway) with whom he has an emotional kinship Both use casual sex as an escape from the utter shallowness and insincerity of their lives. Its their drug of choice. Maggie has to take other drugs too as she has early-onset Parkinsons disease. The movie all but ignores this for a while letting the two get to enjoy better and better recreational sex while refusing to acknowledge they care for one another in the slightest. When they do fall into the most reluctant love you can imagine -- the best humor in the film comes in the couples real fear and loathing of this fact -- then Parkinsons moves front and center as a major player in the drama. Zwicks movie never descends into a disease-of-the-week melodrama but Jamies search for a cure is more about his fear of the future for himself not his lover. So finally the film finds its story. And then things become shockingly conventional dipping into a break-up and the heartache youve seen a million times over. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway are terrific as two sarcastic sexually hungry young people eager to hop into bed or go up against the nearest wall for a knee-trembler. Sappy romance doesnt suit either of their characters so something goes a little limp when they acknowledge their love. Where a Viagra salesman when you need him? The artists loft coffee house restaurants late night cafes medical offices and a sleek suburban home to a ""pajama party"" where the film takes place are all eye grabbers and Steven Fierbergs cinematography does justice to these visually arresting locations. Much is going on in nearly every scene. Even a running gag about a homeless man who digs drug samples out of a dumpster where Jamie throws his rivals products is damn funny. In the end this is a smart movie that could have been smarter. The script feels like it was a draft or so away from total clarity and focus. But the energy of the cast and a dive into an unfamiliar world make the movie rather addictive.

A super-slick romantic comedy about a charismatic go-getter who pursues his calling and his soul mate in the unlikely world of pharmaceutical sales ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is snappy saucy and like any overzealous product-pusher rather too eager to please. Notable for its barbed portrait of how doctors and drug companies do business as well as an uncommon degree of sexual candor for a mainstream picture this smartly packaged item otherwise hews closely to genre prescriptions. That bodes well for B.O. prospects and ingratiating performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway should help sell the Fox release to the general public. Loosely adapted from Jamie Reidys humorous memoir ""Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman"" ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" qualifies as a change of pace for the usually more epic-minded Edward Zwick (""Defiance"" ""The Last Samurai""). Still the film has some interesting points of contact with the directors ""Blood Diamond"" which similarly took aim at a corrupt global industry represented by an ambitious young stud with a wobbly moral compass. Here that would be Jamie Randall (Gyllenhaal) a good-looking fast-talking young man whos a chronic underachiever everywhere except between the sheets -- at least until he lands a sales position at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Its 1996 and the screenplay (by Zwick Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz all credited as producers) amusingly sketches the mass commercialization of the drug industry as Jamie and hundreds of other aspiring reps are trained to pitch products like Zoloft to doctors some of whom require more persuasion than others. With his eye on a coveted Pfizer post in Chicago Jamie is not above seducing a clinic receptionist (Judy Greer) sabotaging a Prozac-peddling rival (Gabriel Macht) or resorting to other unscrupulous means often encouraged by his battle-hardened mentor (a fine Oliver Platt). One of these tactics brings Jamie into unexpected contact with Maggie Murdock (Hathaway) who at 26 has already been diagnosed with Parkinsons disease. After an unusually punchy meet-cute -- he peeks at her bare breast during a medical exam she wallops him with her messenger bag -- Jamie soon becomes smitten with the wry rough-edged Maggie who readily agrees to sleep with him but insists on maintaining an emotional distance. And so the love of a good but sick woman helps Jamie regain his lost soul while his steadfast devotion throws Maggie off-guard and forces her to confront her own commitment issues. If one can get past the calculation inherent in the drug-pushing-boy-meets-disease-stricken-girl setup ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" clicks largely because its actors do (no small feat considering what an unhappy couple Gyllenhaal and Hathaway made in ""Brokeback Mountain""). Their ribald pillow talk lends the film a verbal tartness thats complemented visually by the abundant nudity though tasteful use of shadows and strategic camera placement still leave plenty to the imagination. Jamies tempestuous relationship with Maggie coincides with his er rising fortunes when hes tapped to sell Viagra just as demand for the performance-enhancing drug is beginning to sweep the nation and Zwicks unflattering snapshot of the venality of the medical establishment is fascinating if fanciful (one hopes). But it also raises expectations of seriousness or at least deeper satirical intent that fizzle out as the film earnestly toes the romantic-comedy line. There seems to be no significant development whether its Jamies training at Pfizer or his tireless quest for a cure for Parkinsons that cant be reduced to a zippy montage and the final scenes are awash in much teary emoting and the unsubtle strains of James Newton Howards score. In this context even the character of Jamies less attractive but more successful brother (an amusing Josh Gad) comes across as a stock supporting oaf. ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" is a jagged little pill that in the end goes down too smoothly. That the films treatment of Parkinsons disease feels as respectful as it does is a credit to Hathaways sensitive understated rendering of her characters symptoms which appear to manifest themselves only when most convenient for the narrative. Crucially the actress makes Maggie a vivacious presence the sheer force of her spirit serving as a rebuke to her physical setbacks and countering the films generally insulting view of women (who fall into three basic categories here bimbos opportunists and Parkinsons patients). As Jamie the ideally cast Gyllenhaal turns on the charm full force his energetic puppy-dog demeanor all but daring the viewer not to buy whatever hes selling. Smoothly mounted pic was lensed in and around Pittsburgh. Soundtrack crammed with 90s hits seems overly determined to underscore the pics timeframe.
