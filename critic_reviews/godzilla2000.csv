"Godzilla - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Godzilla Posted by Christy Lemire on May 18 2014 37 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence. Running time 123 minutes. Three stars out of four. When the bombastic ""Pompeii"" came out a few months ago I asked ""Is it wrong to root for the volcano?"" Now having seen ""Godzilla"" I have to ask ""Is it wrong to root for the kaiju?"" But I mean this as the greatest possible recommendation for the movie. The Godzilla of this ""Godzilla"" is a classically fearsome monster with his hulking size and piercing roar but hes also an irresistible bad-ass who becomes an unlikely hero of sorts. My good friend and ""What the Flick?"" co-host Matt Atchity and I found ourselves actively clapping and cheering for the creature when we saw the movie at a packed press screening. We wanted him to do his thing and do it as ferociously as possible. And he does -- but it takes a while for him to show up and do it. Director Gareth Edwards dares to go for the slow burn -- dares to wait until about the halfway mark to reveal the monster in all his majesty. Its a risky approach reminiscent of the one Steven Spielberg took in ""Jaws"" which allows for not just tension but context. The people matter in Max Borensteins screenplay (although whether the esteemed actors playing them including Juliette Binoche and David Strathairn all register is another matter). But you get the sense that their experience and their terror are as essential as the massive set pieces that usually mark this kind of summer blockbuster. And man are they doozies. Unlike so many effects-laden extravaganzas in which the battles are just noisy indiscernible blurs of slamming and destruction (were looking at you ""Transformers"") you can actually tell who is doing what to whom here. The results are visceral thrilling frightening. Theres texture and perspective a sense of both intimacy and enormity. And the impeccable sound design does wonders to heighten the feeling of dread. ""Godzilla"" is full of ominous creaks and clicks moans and groans. Waiting for these creatures to arrive is as delicious as witnessing the full brunt of their power. Yes creatures plural ones with ancient roots and a legacy to consider. This is not a spoiler folks. ""Godzilla"" begins in 1999 with a pair of startling events the discovery of a massive crater full of radioactive fossilized remnants in the Philippines and a meltdown at a Japanese nuclear power plant where seismic activity appears to be the culprit. Surely this cannot be a coincidence -- and sure enough skeptical scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) who had worked at the plant drives himself to obsession in search of the truth. Cut to 15 years later. Joes grown son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a Navy lieutenant looking forward to returning home to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and their young son Sam (Carson Bolde) in San Francisco. Olsen an actress with great presence and a daring streak to her choices doesnt get to do much here beyond play the supportive nurse and worried mom -- but with those beautiful wide eyes she has the perfect face to play a horror movie damsel in distress. But soon after Ford arrives hes called to Japan to bail his father out of jail for trespassing -- and gets sucked into the old mans conspiracy theories all over again. Turns out Joe was right. And Ford happens to be in Japan at the perfect moment to find out just how right Joe was. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins bring just he right amount of gravitas to their roles as the scientists whove been investigating these elusive monsters and the electromagnetic pulses their activities create for decades. Strathairn as the admiral coordinating the military element of the fight functions as a singularly stoic and stern presence. And then theres Taylor-Johnson whos pretty but bland and a weak link at the films emotional center. But as an action hero the young man who has played both a lanky John Lennon in ""Nowhere Boy"" and a vigilante crimefighter in the ""Kick-Ass"" movies has bulked up and is ready for the challenge and Taylor-Johnson does figure prominently in some of the more visually arresting sequences Edwards has to offer. (Seamus McGarvey whose work ranges from ""Atonement"" to ""The Avengers"" to ""Anna Karenina"" is the cinematographer.) One takes place on a dark and quiet train trestle in the middle of the night. The other finds Ford and a group of soldiers leaping from a plane into the smoky hellish blackness that used to be downtown San Francisco the sight of the films climactic clashes. Red flares trail from their feet as they descend into the unknown. The image is eerily beautiful. If you take a step back though and consider the location all the havoc and destruction is also slightly amusing. This is what you get San Francisco with all your douchey flashy dot-com money You get stomped on by Godzilla. Now that hes served his purpose and restored balance he can slink back off into the Pacific Ocean for a leisurely afternoon swim.

Best place to live in the U.S Reply May 21 2014  by  kermit     Yeah with an overwhelming surplus of tech hipsters mass gentrification and skyrocketing property values San Francisco certainly is a lovely haven for the rich to squander their techie spoils. I love cities that are more than willing to obliterate the middle working class population by literally kicking them the hell out. San Francisco is pretty great. Reply May 28 2014  by  Christopher Kimson     Nah. Thats pretty debatable. Sure the views great but I think New York City would give San Francisco a run for its money. Reply May 19 2014  by  Ted     Great review. You take pop culture seriously and because of that we get more insight on what it means -- and why its fun. A blockbuster that dares to go for the slow burn? Imagine. Reply May 19 2014  by  MovieJay (MovieJay)     I appreciate that it took after the ""Jaws"" model but finally I felt like the movie thought it was teasing me when in fact I was just sitting there waiting for it to get cookin. I think thats because I had had enough of watching characters essentially watching the movie on tv in the movie. That and the human story I felt was so by-the-numbers. And gosh was it serious. All that expository dialogue was so generic it couldnt even be mistaken as camp. Excellent CGI and Im glad you had a good time at it. Seems most people did. But watching actors I like having to act like cardboard cutouts was frustrating. And why was Cranstons character perceived as nuts if what they needed all along was his help in the first place? That drove me up the wall. Id like to see it get campy again the next time out and start having more fun.

Reply June 12 2014  by  Ironbob     Shes bitter because all those douchy dot-commers actually bring value to people whereas all LA brings is douchy movies reviewed by douchy chicks that no one knows or cares about.

But thanks very much for reading all the way down to the bottom Reply May 19 2014  by  Joe     Didnt you get the memo Christy. People from the Bay Area dont have a sense of humor. Reply May 23 2014  by  MikeinLA     Ive lived in LA for forty years and based upon much experience I conclude that San Francisco is indeed a douchey arrogant pretentious place with a dreary climate high prices prickly and defensive residents and a really annoying baseball team. If you slag on San Francisco somebody will probably offer to punch your nose. If you slag on LA somebody will probably just suggest you go home and complain about that. I havent seen Godzilla by the way. My grandsons liked it which is not a comforting endorsement. As we say in LA Have a nice day.

Frankly I am quite surprised by her review glad she liked it but usually Christy hates movies. Reply May 19 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Exactly. I hate movies which is why Ive made a career out of writing about them for the past 15-plus years. Reply May 20 2014  by  Jake S.     I know...4 out of 10 movies you reviewed you liked. Thats why Statesmans Journal finally went a different direction. Short lived though. Reply May 19 2014  by  Bobby     Hey there first time commenter....I agree with this review wholeheartedly I felt like the build-up to our first look at the big guy was exciting and I actually clapped like a little kid when I first saw him. It made me feel the same way that the original ones did so many years ago And the San Fran comment was a joke peeps...stop being so uptight  Reply May 19 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Hi Bobby -- thanks very much for sharing your thoughts and welcome Reply May 19 2014  by  Slof Anster     I was so pleased that we didnt get Monster vs Monster for an hour worth of the movie. The slow burn was the correct approach and when we finally see Godzilla enter the scene it is AWESOME. The first time we got to see him fully I nearly wet myself with glee. The way Godzilla dispatches of the last MUTO was epic. I dont think it was a great movie but it certainly was a good one that I just may go see again. Its a movie that works better in a theater I believe. 7.5/10 rating. Reply May 20 2014  by  Michael Tamaka     Godzilla 2014 Christy your Pompeii comment is epic One of the best lines Ive heard from a reviewer in recent memory. Kudos to you The new Godzilla tries to put back some of the gravitas of the original 1954 film that started all of this. Not the US version with Raymond Burr nor the numerous comical incarnations of the character over the years but the uncut Japanese version with sub-titles. See the Criterion version of this iconic film. It is beautifully restored from very damaged original elements I think the weakness of this new visually stunning version aside from the scenes with Brody and his wife is the emphasis on the military which tends to make emotional content less than three dimensional (pun included). There is more of a focus on the human cost in the original film which has a depth that American fantasy films rarely equal. At one point in Tokyos destruction a mother and child amid the rubble facing imminent death from Godzilla says to her child ""Soon you will be with your father..."" One doesnt expect such a touching scene in a monster movie This is what makes the original powerful - not the good-for-the-time special effects which pale in comparison to this new visually awesome version but the human story. After all the Japanese know about real nuclear devastation and Americans havent endured two atomic bombs dropped upon their cities. For Godzilla embodies both the unstoppable force of Nature and the unnatural power of the atomic bomb.

Reply May 20 2014  by  Justin Barfield     Hey Christie you might not remember me but I left a comment on your review of Prisoners a while back. Anyway I agree with a lot of what you have to say here. Godzilla (the kaiju) is fantastic He truly is the King of the Monsters here At three hundred fifty feet of scales muscles and atomic breath he is a most impressive beast. The MUTOs are great too though not as impressive. Good cinematography too but the acting seemed hit and miss to me. I agree Taylor wasnt the most interesting lead either (doesnt help that Cranston played his father). Watanabe was...strange to me. Had some good lines but kept walking around like a slack-jawed shell-shocked veteran. Maybe it was the writing but something about him didnt work out for me this go-round. The slow-burn worked in making Godzilla intimidating but also seemed to big down the pacing a little. I thought the film was 20 minutes too long. Overall good movie but not a masterpiece. Im actually in the process of writing my own review of Godzilla on my blog. When Im done would you be willing to take a look at it and give me some feedback? I can always use some constructive criticism Reply May 21 2014  by  harry     This was the greatest motion picture of all time and always will be. Reply May 21 2014  by  Ian     This is a hit I guarantee a sequel Reply May 22 2014  by  Solomon     THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE Did anyone actually watch it? The actors sucked the plot sucked and that you actually compared any part of this to jaws is a travesty Reply May 26 2014  by  James     I did see it and it was awesome especially the ending. Reply October 7 2014  by  Ripple     Finally someone said it I was beginning to think that everyone has lost their minds. I will never understand people going to see an action movie and dont want to see action. You cant call a movie Godzilla and the cut the scene every time he shows up and is about to do his thing. Thats who Godzilla is. Hes the unlikely hero. He comes in kicks butt and he leaves. I couldnt even finish the movie bc it sucked so bad. I heard there was a fight scene at the end but even that sucked. And whats with the monsters moving in slow motion? Just bc something is big doesnt mean it has to be slow. Ridiculously boring movie. Reply May 23 2014  by  KJ     Damn I was going to take a pass on this movie but now Im going to give it a go and avoid the long opening night lines for X-men. A two movie weekend is a great thing Reply May 26 2014  by  Jeannie     Great review Christie I too thought of Jaws when I realized that the director was using Godzilla in small but powerful doses. There were indeed great visuals (the parachuting scene was among my favorite and the visual of only Godzillas scales breaking the surface of the ocean). The acting of Bryan Cranston (very well known for his amazing acting chops on TV) Juliette Binoche and and David Strathairn were much appreciated and brought some cred to the film. Overall I enjoyed the film for what it was ... a great popcorn movie. And what monster movie can be delivered without cheesy suspension of disbelief? I live in San Francisco and chuckled at your humorous jab ... half winced too because I wish second wave of a tech boom didnt have such a negative affect on those of us who have lived here for a long time and invested in the sense of community here -- its led to the displacement of long time residents because of higher rents. The techies represent only a portion of the City not all of it. The City and the Greater Bay Area has much to offer. The people I know here are kind creative and welcoming ... so come on up Reply May 28 2014  by  Chris R.     Christy I agree one hundred percent that the sequence of them jumping off the plane into the smoky unknown with those trailing red flares set to the eerie monolith music from 2001 (Liszt?) was a stand-out. That was my favorite scene of the film hands down and oddly enough the same scene was used for the first trailer.

But now the beast has once again awakened in payment for our sins ...Related Story Why Arent Movie Monsters Terrifying Anymore? I refer not to Godzilla the monster but to Godzilla the franchise which last laid waste to these shores 16 years ago. If anything its a bit of a surprise that its taken this long for a reboot to rear its spiky head. After all the big guy has near-universal name recognition hes tailor-made for the Age of CGI and--lets face it--we all still need to wash the taste of Roland Emmerichs version out of our mouths. To this day his 1998 Godzilla stands tall among the most unfathomably ill-conceived blockbusters of all time. Matthew Broderick? I love the actor but the only Godzilla he has any business starring in is a Broadway musical. Maria Pitillo? Best I can tell she went directly from her Razzie-winning performance into the witness protection program. And the monster itself? A whippy sour-faced iguana that turned the entire project into an exercise in identity theft.The bar in other words was set low for director Gareth Edwardss reintroduction of Toho Studios Finest. And for a time the movie clears it easily. We begin in 1999 with Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) an American engineer in charge of a fictional nuclear plant in the shadow of Mount Fuji. Theres been an earthquake in the Philippines and tremors are now being felt in Japan. Or are they tremors? They seem too regular almost as if they were caused by ...? Its a thought that goes unfinished as the plant begins to shudder apart. The core is breached and the facility evacuated but not before terrible losses of life have been sustained.Fifteen years later Joe still cant get past that day. Something else happened hes sure of it something thats being covered up. So he studies seismographs. He reads books on animal echolocation. And he trespasses repeatedly in the quarantine zone surrounding the demolished nuclear plant. On one of these occasions hes caught by Japanese authorities who summon his grown son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to come bail him out. Ford a Navy lieutenant and ordnance disposal technician has only just returned home from a tour of duty to his family in San Francisco but he hops a plane for Japan nonetheless. There his dad enlists him in the family obsession. Tremors just like those that preceded the terrible accident at the plant have begun again and father and son are intent on getting to the bottom of them.Its an excellent start to the film heavy with foreboding and punctuated by genuine loss. And sure enough when Joe and Ford infiltrate the quarantine zone together they find at its center a secret facility performing experiments on a giant larval monster that feeds on nuclear radiation. Yes--its GodzillaNo deed or decision made by any human character seems to have the slightest impact on the inexorable mechanics of the plot. Actually no its not Godzilla. And it is here that the movie begins its long downhill slide. This is another giant radioactive monster--dubbed the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism or MUTO--and it was responsible for the 1999 tragedy at the plant. Nor is it alone a second variation of the ickily insectoid species soon makes an appearance as well. From here the plot proceeds in an utterly straight line--or to be more precise three intersecting lines--of giant-monster rampage. The MUTOs want to meet and mate and Godzilla wants in on the party for reasons of his own. The paths of the three gargantuas are set to converge--whod have guessed?--in San Francisco right on top of Fords wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son.Ford and his colleagues in the Armed Forces attempt to prevent the MUTO rendezvous by deploying a nuclear weapon--this despite the fact that they know the MUTOs literally eat radioactive material for breakfast. Then they bring in another nuke (also eaten) and another (ditto). I honestly lost track of how many times the military tried to get a missile into position only to watch it get munched by a MUTO. It was like watching an atomic-pizza-delivery service for giant arachnids.Indeed Godzilla is a film in which no deed or decision made by any human character seems to have the slightest impact on the inexorable mechanics of the plot. The cast is quite strong In addition to Cranston and Olsen there are also roles for Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins Juliette Binoche and David Strathairn. But none of them--none--is given anything meaningful to do. As for Taylor-Johnsons performance as Ford the movies central human protagonist it was so dutifully generic that I forgot it even as I was watching it. I have no lasting impression of him whatsoever.Godzilla is of course a monster movie and thus should rise or fall on the strength of its monsters. And thankfully director Edwards (Monsters) is wise enough to give us a recognizable if somewhat updated Godzilla. But rather than harken back to the aesthetic of Godzillas traditional adversaries--Rodan Mothra etc.--the MUTOs are exactly the kind of oddly-jointed grotesqueries that have been in such vogue more recently from Starship Troopers to Cloverfield to Pacific Rim. Moreover while the requisite Final Battle with Godzilla is a fair amount of fun it makes up a tiny portion of the film which is mostly concerned with the MUTOs stomping their way across the globe (Honolulu Las Vegas) toward the City by the Bay.Indeed until the closing act Godzilla himself is strangely peripheral to the proceedings. Edwards introduces the monster gradually--a glimpse here a glimpse there--as Ishiro Honda did with the original Godzilla 60 years ago. But this bid for mystery and suspense is largely undone by the fact that we see a lot of the MUTOs.The relentlessly humorless tone of Edwardss film is not much in keeping with that monster-of-the-week ethos.The idea I suppose was to mimic not merely Hondas searching somber film but also its many campier sequels in which Godzilla periodically reappeared to save Japan from one or another new super-sized threat--Ghidorah Mechagodzilla the Smog Monster etc. But the relentlessly humorless tone of Edwardss film is not much in keeping with that monster-of-the-week ethos. And in any case this is not a sequel but a reboot. It really ought to focus on Godzilla no?Thus the central irony of Edwardss film. Godzilla can handle everything the military hurls at him ships guns planes rockets even a squadron of HALO paratroopers. The only thing that can cut him down to size is being relegated to a supporting role in his very own movie.

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd.

""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

By Anthony Lane The creature rises from the oceans once again in Gareth Edwardss new movie.   Credit Illustration by Ronald Kurniawan Wrinkled and crinkled huge in Japan heroically reluctant to give up and forever touring the world on a mission to make us scream Godzilla is the Mick Jagger of giant amphibians. In the latest version of the legend directed by Gareth Edwards Godzilla even has a Ronnie and a Keith to mess around with a pair of scaly primeval throwbacks who rise from the depths and join him in merry mayhem. For food they snack on nuclear power plants and other sources of radiation chomping atomic warheads as if they were Twinkies. All thats missing from this film is a Charlie Watts figure some slender beast nicely preserved calmly beating time at the back of the action. We begin in 1999 in the Philippines where mining operations have unearthed what is either a fossilized rib cage the size of an aircraft hangar or a stage set that Ridley Scott ordered for ""Prometheus"" and then forgot to use. Its principal function is to allow a visiting scientist (Sally Hawkins) to utter the phrase ""Oh my God is it possible?"" indicating that the next two hours are unlikely to stray from a well-trampled path. Other pleasing examples for any scholar of disaster movies include ""I cant believe this is happening"" and--a truly outstanding contribution to the genre--""Im assuming that your organization has situational awareness of the unidentified creature."" In common parlance this means ""Wheres the big bug gone?"" but that would break the mood. The screenplay is by Max Borenstein and the story by David Callahan but no doubt other hands were involved. The computerized imagery in ""Godzilla"" is so prodigious and therefore so greedy for the filmmakers attention that it seems to have sucked the life out of the writing. From the Philippines we spring to Japan where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) both work at a nuclear facility which has the misfortune to be treated as an all-you-can-eat buffet by predators unknown. Next we advance fifteen years by which time Brody--strangely unaged with the same bad hair as if a dose of plutonium keeps you young--is still hung up on what happened. By contrast his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has brushed the past aside and become a valiant buff and indomitably boring naval officer with a devoted wife (Elizabeth Olsen) a home in San Francisco and a job in bomb disposal. He has one of those tricky talks with his father about moving on making a change and so forth; they then wake up the next morning and have the same conversation all over again. I took this to be an editorial oversight but its the start of a pattern. We get an exciting scene on a bridge for instance which is then compounded by a slightly less exciting scene on a different bridge--the Golden Gate indeed which not long ago had an army of indignant chimps clambering all over it in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" When was the last time that anyone actually succeeded in driving across without interruption? The geography of ""Godzilla"" is a curious matter. Once the monsters get their heads down and start causing serious damage their first port of call is Honolulu. Then comes Las Vegas. The implication is clear these are not mutants or Jurassic dinosaurs that have somehow survived the eons or the result of technological hubris on the part of mankind. No they are tourists--hellbent on the nations hot spots like the students in last years ""Spring Breakers"" but minus the Day-Glo bikinis. ""Why would they go to Nevada?"" somebody asks and the obvious answer is ""To get rat-assed on forty-dollar mai tais hauled off the blackjack tables and married in an Elvis suit at two oclock in the morning."" Some hope. The beasts just want to have fun but the gravest letdown in Edwardss film is that most of the time he fends off the chance to have fun himself. How he manages to insert a humongous creepy-crawly into the Strip have it stomp around in the footsteps of Sinatra and not derive a single decent visual gag from the experience is to be honest beyond me. According to this movie the best reason to go to Nevada is to gather radioactive waste. Get a kick out of that. It didnt have to be this way. Four years ago Edwards made his first feature with the no-frills name of ""Monsters."" There were frills on view but much of it consisted of two young Americans journeying across the ""Infected Zone""--a portion of Mexico where a probe sent into space by NASA to collect samples of alien life had crashed. The movie had its longueurs but there was a scruffy plausibility to it and for anyone interested in the issue of border control a whiff of acrid political unease. Though the monsters were few they were hardly far between; you sensed them dangling at the edges of the tale and when they did arrive in plain sight like tentacled towers the awe was unfeigned. The climax which unfolded by night at a deserted gas station was so frightening and also so beautiful that it moved our heroes--and maybe some viewers--to the verge of tears although others lured by the title may have been outraged that so little blood was shed. The budget for ""Monsters"" whose special effects were created by Edwards on his laptop was eight hundred thousand dollars. ""Godzilla"" his second feature is estimated to have cost a hundred and sixty million dollars. Theres a moral here somewhere. The smaller movie was unhurried but it knew where it was heading and set a clear course whereas the blockbuster lopes and lollops around like a stoned stegosaurus neither knowing nor caring where it needs to go next. The invading beings in ""Monsters"" were vast yet their motions--and the meetings between them--bore the air of a delicate writhing dance which belied their aggression and made you wonder whether despite the evidence they were really here for a rampage. Was mankind not reaping what it had sown? A trace of that worry lingers in ""Godzilla"" and I was impressed by the films idea that the nuclear tests in the Pacific in the nineteen-fifties were not tests at all but attempts to destroy what lurked beneath the oceans. The emotional crux of the movie however after all the international to-and-fro turns out to be the safety and togetherness of one middle-class family on the West Coast. The leading man of ""Monsters"" gazing from the Zone toward a walled frontier murmurs ""Its different looking at America from the outside in"" but the new film never risks such an audacious thought. Instead it takes refuge on the inside and girds itself against the enemies from beyond. To be fair Edwards is not the first director to have his style cramped rather than liberated by being given a ton of money to disburse. Nor is he the first to be blessed with a wonderful cast--as well as Cranston Binoche Olsen and Hawkins we get Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn--and to contrive by some miracle of mishandling to waste every one of them. But who is at fault here? Who set up the grim routine whereby whenever the drama flags a child--sometimes an entirely random one without a name about whom we couldnt give a damn--is tossed into peril and plucked free? That could be a desperate decision taken at the executive level or simply a formula so commonplace like the flea-bitten dialogue and the hokey delivery that no one could be bothered to rethink it still less to throw it away and start afresh. After all the audience might complain. Credit to Edwards then that here and there he grabs the opportunity to flourish. Give him an overhead camera say and hes a happy man. Theres a lovely shot of Godzilla at sea his ridged spine plowing through the waves with a warship riding shotgun on each flank and an even cooler moment when he dives under the hull of an aircraft carrier crossing smoothly at ninety degrees. (This is a straight steal from ""Jaws"" but there are worse films to plunder.) As for the bright-blue electromagnetic projectile vomit that one of the monsters coughs up by way of a party piece well thats not something you see every day. Best of all as the light thickens and dies over the Bay Area toward the end the movie does grind and smash its way into a kind of majesty--a shadow play almost with airborne troops dropping in free fall through the storm clouds devil-red flares strapped to their heels and Godzilla and his cronies going mano a mano in the murk. By now the beasts are barely distinguishable an abstract infernal chaos of warty skin and swipes of vicious claw. Thats what the perfect ""Godzilla"" should be no character development no backstory no winsome kids just hints and glimpses of immeasurable power--enough to make you jump and twitch and leave you sweating for more. Luckily that ideal already exists and it requires only two minutes not two hours of your time. So skip ""Godzilla"" the movie. Watch the trailer.

Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Godzilla goes after San Francisco in this newest update to the classic monster movie. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures The world has already seen 28 Godzilla movies -- 29 if you count Roland Emmerichs 1998 Hollywood remake (which most of us dont). So why is another one opening this week? Well the fiduciary logic is no doubt compelling if youre a studio executive -- even that widely derided 90s version made 379 million -- but for the rest of us director Gareth Edwards needs to make a case. He starts in the opening credits by letting you know that everything you think you know about this story is suspect. The background is black-and-white footage of atom bomb tests from the 1940s and 50s -- the time Godzilla originally surfaced; the foreground movie credits. But as soon as each credit comes up its redacted words blacked out censored as if to say the audience lacks security clearance. Something has been kept from us. Flash forward to 1999 when earnest scientists Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins come across a mysterious radioactive exoskeleton in the Philippines at about the moment that trouble surfaces at a Japanese nuclear facility. A seismic disturbance -- think of it as a bug in the system -- destroys the reactor giving the authorities an excuse to keep everyone away from it for the next 15 years including a hysterically shock-haired Bryan Cranston who lost his wife (Juliette Binoche) in the reactor meltdown and whos now convinced that the powers that be are hiding something. I wont describe what theyre hiding except to say that its not Godzilla. But it is big and feeds on radiation so if you come at it with nuclear weapons it thinks youre just serving snacks. Oh and it emits electromagnetic pulses that knock out all things technological. Nifty critter about to escape. Fortunately for humanity the navys on hand to give it an acronym. Graaaaaaaaaargh Movies Movie Monsters Monster Movies And Why Godzilla Endures The Making Of Godzilla Japans Favorite Mon-Star Pop Culture Movie Mutants Give A Face To Our Nuclear Fears ""M.U.T.O."" intones Admiral David Straithairn with more seriousness than you might expect. ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" adding parenthetically that it has ceased being terrestrial and is airborne and headed across the Pacific. So the navy follows and on the way it finds Godzilla -- or rather Godzilla finds it and swims along with the fleet like a whale among minnows all the way to that tough-luck town San Francisco which has only just shaken off the critters from Pacific Rim. At least you know the burg can bounce back from a good trampling. Director Edwards got this job after making a creative little indie called Monsters on which he had to be creative because his entire budget was less than half a million dollars. Here his effects budget is more than 200 times that so its nice that hes still bothering to be inventive -- offering nods to previous Godzilla movies here and there reflecting real-life environmental concerns just often enough to erase any vestigial memories of Roland Emmerichs 1998 version and doing a lot of clever visual storytelling through windshield wipers or freshly gaping holes in trains or on video screens with wildly understated headlines like ""Crisis in Vegas."" He also finds very pretty ways to put viewers in the middle of a parachute jump past snarling 350-foot critters. Does it matter that the onscreen folks doing the parachuting including Kick-Asss seriously buffed-up Aaron Taylor-Johnson whos ready to defuse bombs at the drop of a skyscraper arent nearly as interesting as the tricks hes using to tell their story? Well we havent come to see them really. Were here to see the films leading lizard who is pretty gorgeously realized by an army of digitizers even if he seems just a bit-player in his own movie for the first hour or so. Fans will very likely think that in the second hour he makes up for it chewing the scenery with enough enthusiasm that it almost doesnt matter that its digital and hence not very nourishing.

"Celebration of the Lizard << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Its So Hard to Say Good-bye  Next Fear the Underdog? Facebook Twitter Print Movies Celebration of the Lizard The new Godzilla movie? Oh yeah. Its real good. by Alex Pappademas on May 16 2014 History shows again and again how nature points out the folly of man. Gareth Edwardss epic kaiju-CGI Godzilla reboot -- the first truly joyous popcorn action movie of the season -- arrives just a few months after the 60th anniversary of March 1 1954 when the United States set off a hydrogen bomb near Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands just to see what would happen. Thanks to human error back home at Los Alamos a device (nicknamed ""The Shrimp"") expected to yield between six and eight megatons of explosive energy instead produced 15 still the largest nuclear blast ever triggered by Americans. Then the wind shifted blowing a radioactive plume over more than 7000 square miles of ocean including several islands the U.S. had failed to evacuate and the Japanese fishing trawler Daigo Fukuryu Maru or Lucky Dragon Number 5. The crew suffered radiation sickness and the ships radio operator eventually died. Meanwhile on the island of Rongelap 100 miles from Bikini children played in drifts of fallout believing it was snow. Gojira the very first Godzilla movie was released in Japan by the Toho Company eight months later in November of 54. Cowritten and directed by Ishiro Honda with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya its remembered not incorrectly as an attempt to allegorically process the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American atomic bombs in 1945 a monster movie that transmuted trauma into mythic kitsch. But it opens with a virtual reenactment of the Lucky Dragon incident -- a mysterious flash of light fishing boats adrift on a boiling sea. Hondas film metaphorized the horrors of the recent past in big-rubber-lizard form but it also addressed the horrors of the present. Its unlike any other subsequent Godzilla movie -- black-and-white surprisingly somber a little boring. The independent distributors who released it in America in 1956 as Godzilla King of the Monsters cut it by 40 minutes excising or garbling most of the references to the bomb and adding an American-point-of-view character in the form of a reporter played by Raymond Burr who interacted with the original cast through the magic of dubbing and body doubles. Dozens of sequels followed with every aspect of the franchise fluctuating wildly from film to film -- tone budget suit crappiness degree of fealty to previously established backstory intentionality of comedy Godzillas goodness or badness relative to other monsters even his height. Godzilla met King Kong Venusian princesses the lightning-powered man-beetle Megalon and the giant robot Jet Jaguar a bootleg Ultraman; he was a rampaging atomic-age golem then a hero to children then a monster again. He acquired a Scrappy Doo-ish ward named Minilla played by the Japanese little person and wrestler ""Little Man"" Machan and learned to be a dad; he was dealt to an alien race with a King Ghidorah problem in exchange for the cure for cancer which the aliens never supplied. He even survived Roland Emmerichs hatefully dumb Godzilla from 1998 which reduced the King of All Monsters to a glorified T. rex in a misguided stab at realism as if that were what was holding these movies back from taking their rightful place alongside Shakespeare in the pantheon. Among purist Tohoites the Emmerich monster is derisively referred to as ""Zilla""; in 2004s Godzilla Final Wars he reappears as part of a series-record-setting 13-monster invasion unleashed by an intergalactic tyrant but lasts about a minute against the One True Godz who hurls him into the Sydney Opera House before disintegrating him a finishing move that doubled as an act of film criticism (and architecture criticism I guess). Like any great screen icon he filtered out into the pop water supply as a joke and a hipster shibboleth a sample and a postmodern hero. You could find him stomping Bambi in one of the most famous 90-second films ever made tangling with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Doctor Doom in his own Marvel comic getting dunked on by Charles Barkley in a Nike ad and mocked on Mystery Science Theater 3000. After Gravitys Rainbow Thomas Pynchon was reportedly working on a book about an insurance investigator surveying the wreckage of a Godz-stomped Tokyo a plot that became a single scene in Vineland 17 years later. And Mark Jacobsons hallucinatory 1991 novel Gojiro is told from the POV of the beast now a scaly showbiz lifer kept alive against his will by the mental energy of his fans. ""Wouldnt be no big thing if I was a regular movie star"" he moans. ""Any regulation above-the-title player they just blow into town chisel their shallow aspect upon the Rushmore of culture tip out before everyone gets tired of looking at them. The whole beautiful corpse configuration. But not me Nooo I got to live forever."" Strictly speaking Edwardss movie ignores all thats preceded it as reboots are entitled to do. Like Cloverfield or Pacific Rim -- both Godzilla movies that happened to not actually star Godzilla both movies this one is obligated to one-up creatively if not commercially -- it tries to logically extrapolate how our first contact with Big G might play out if it happened today. But its also slyly a meta-Godzilla movie in which our own past experience with the character -- the feeling that weve seen all this before -- resurfaces subliminally as a plotline about secret history. In the dizzying title sequence images from Darwins On the Origin of Species give way to documents that redact themselves before our eyes and real archival footage mingles with fiction like JFKs park-bench scene crossed with the opening of Zack Snyders Watchmen; just before Bikini Atoll is rather ingeniously woven into the canon we get a split-second glimpse of some familiar spines. And thats all we get Godzilla-wise for quite some time. In the meantime we meet a scientist played by Ken Watanabe and then two more nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston sporting a suspicious wig from the Greg Kinnear for Men collection) and his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and eventually their grown son Ford a military explosives-disposal expert (Aaron Taylor-Johnson from Kick-Ass unrecognizably buff). As a general tasked with anti-Godzilla operations David Strathairn gets a character introduction so drawn out and extravagant it feels like the movie is about to turn into Godzilla vs. Strathairn then basically disappears. The human beings are mostly there to give us a sense of how big the monsters are; thanks to the depth offered by 3-D images Edwardss Godzilla sets a new standard for the integration of tiny people and giant radioactive aberrations in the same shot heretofore the jankiest-looking aspect of all Godzilla films. But the closest thing to a real emotional arc involves the Brody men who havent gotten along since Joe became obsessed with the idea that his former employers were covering up the truth about the disaster that destroyed the plant he once worked at in Japan. And boy are they ever. Spoilerphobes unaware of the basic plot mechanics of every giant-monster-fight movie ever made now would be a good time to click away. Turns out Watanabe and a team of scientists working for a government-ish agency called Monarch have been keeping a monster under wraps in the quarantine zone around the old nuke plant for years -- something called a MUTO or Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism. Shortly after Joe and Ford show up at Monarchs doorstep looking for answers it hatches from its cocoon and brings the house down. So fuck arcs. A flapping super-mantis with a can-opener head the MUTO resembles one of the bugs from Starship Troopers grown colossal and its introduction lets Edwards fire up the catastrophic-property-destruction portion of the film while keeping the guest of honor off-camera for a while longer. Of the many things this Godzilla gets right the most important is also the simplest. The movie knows who its star is believes in his magnetism and trusts that well wait for him to show up provided we can still watch some landmarks get stepped on in the meantime. We live in fan-servicey times so this is a nervy choice. But Edwards has clearly learned a thing or two from Steven Spielberg about when to show us the shark. (He also never misses an opportunity to amplify a moment of terror or wonder by cutting to the face of a wide-eyed child which is classic Jurassic Park stuff.) When we do finally get a look at Godzilla hes imposing thick-necked and slit-eyed ornery as if rudely awakened. This is a Godzilla whos been around the paleontological block a few times who is maybe getting too old for this shit. Hes part Komodo dragon part Robert Duvall. Godzilla as grumpy-badass antihero is a nice touch; it honors the memory of the fan-beloved kid-friendly G films in which he acts as Earths benevolent roadhouse bouncer -- You dont have to go home SpaceGodzilla but you cant stay here -- without robbing him of his apex-predator menace the way those movies did. Hes anthropomorphized just enough which is the fine line a film like this has to walk. At long last all the players have suited up. ""Let them fight"" Watanabe says speaking on behalf of the audience and so they do Godzilla and the MUTO taking down most of San Franciscos financial district in the process. The moment is everything you want it to be a bar brawl that happens to topple skyscrapers. Im guessing itll feel like too little too late for some people but I admired Edwardss restraint a quality Im not accustomed to admiring in 160 million summer action movies. Edwards made only one other feature before this one 2010s Monsters a mumblecore/sci-fi travelogue shot for around 500000 mostly with a seven-person crew. Scoot McNairy plays a photojournalist who agrees to transport his bosss daughter out of a Mexico overrun with tentacled extraterrestrial predators. Things go awry and the notion that Mexicos problems are Americas problems no matter how many fences we erect is conveyed cleverly if not subtly. Edwards has been spinning his Godzilla in interviews as a global-warming allegory with Godzilla as an agent of the natural order kicking insectoid ass in order to right an out-of-whack ecosystem. The movie supports that reading but doesnt particularly encourage it. Its probably too much to ask that a movie this purely enjoyable also deliver trenchant social commentary. But given the franchises history of accidental-on-purpose cathexis I can dream -- of a rematch with the Smog Monster maybe. This column has been updated to correct a typo in the year atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; it was 1945 not 1946.

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide I must say that despite my better instincts I was looking forward to ""Godzilla"" because it had such a bang-up trailer. But beware falling into the Trailer Trap. Sometimes oftentimes trailers showcase only the good stuff. The actual movie is a pale substitute. Such is the case here. Its a tad better than the 1998 ""Godzilla"" perhaps but thats not saying much. A lot of name actors including Juliette Binoche Bryan Cranston Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and a particularly uncomfortable-looking David Strathairn turn up. Who if any will end up as dino-fodder?Director Gareth Edwards and his screenwriter Max Borenstein have made the humorless boneheaded decision to make Godzilla a good guy. The bad guys actually a guy and a girl are a pair of MUTOs - ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms"" - that have been roused from their slumber or whatever by Filipino miners. San Francisco and Honolulu are among the places that get stomped. Godzilla faces off against the MUTOs who resemble gigantic Jaguar hood ornaments and is proclaimed by the grateful public as the ""King of the Monsters.""

"Godzilla review Gareth Edwards 2014 movie delivers when it comes to giant lizards whaling on stuff. Slate Sign In Sign Up Godzilla Lives On and So Does the Eternal Appeal of Giant Lizards Whaling on Stuff Godzilla Lives On and So Does the Eternal Appeal of Giant Lizards Whaling on Stuff Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 15 2014 955 PM Want to See a Giant Radioactive Lizard Whale on Stuff? Then Godzilla delivers. By Dana Stevens You can almost come to miss this big mother. Photo courtesy Warner Bros. After youve seen Godzilla come back and listen to our Spoiler Special The original Godzilla--a hugely influential Japanese monster movie made in 1954 as a direct response to a recent ripped-from-the-headlines tragedy--is a staggeringly powerful film but in some ways its hard to account for the long cinematic life its title character has enjoyed. Ishiro Hondas somber Godzilla (the Japanese title Gojira was created by combining the words for ""gorilla"" and ""whale"") was a raw scream of collective anxiety from a nation that nine years before had survived two atomic bombings and that was now finding itself caught quite literally in the fallout zone of the U.S./Soviet race to build and test an even more destructive hydrogen bomb. That original Godzilla seems so tied to the time and place of its creation that its hard to mentally transpose the central monster--a lumbering mega-dinosaur coaxed from the ocean depths by human experiments with radiation--into any other context. Yet that transposition has now occurred 32 times in 60 years (give or take a mecha-lizard) most recently in the form of Gareth Edwards Godzilla in which the lumbering lizard is reinvented--not for the first time--as humanitys potential helpmate. I guess its not hard to see the enduring appeal of the Godzilla myth even divorced from the context of traumatized post-World War II Japan. The arrogance of human attempts to best the gods with technology is an eternally relevant theme (Icarus Prometheus Faust Frankenstein Flubber) and theres no gainsaying the basic fun to be had in watching a bumpy-skinned reptile as big as a skyscraper reduce an entire city to rubble beneath his gargantuan stomping feet. Plus by now Godzilla with his radioactive fire-breath stumpy waving forelegs and aversion to intact skylines is an archetypal almost lovable figure--a quality highly valued by film studios in search of market-ready tentpole entertainments. Edwards Godzilla is likely to do a decent job holding up its end of Warner Bros. 2014 tent Its a smooth sleek technologically awe-inspiring 3-D blockbuster with a top-shelf cast (speaking middle-to-lower-shelf dialogue most of the time to be sure but they do it with style). By now Godzilla with his radioactive fire-breath stumpy waving forelegs and aversion to intact skylines is an archetypal almost lovable figure. Advertisement For a shining moment in the first reel it seems like Bryan Cranstons appealingly schlubby Joe Brody a scientist stationed at a nuclear plant in Janjira Japan with his family will be our hero. But after a scientifically unexplainable disaster at the plant kills Brodys wife (Juliette Binoche who packs a lot into her doomed 10 minutes onscreen) we flash forward 15 years and the focus switches to the Brodys now-grown son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a specialist in bomb defusing for the Army. Joe now a reclusive conspiracy theorist obsessed with revisiting the meltdown that took his wifes life breaks the law by visiting the quarantined zone to retrieve evidence from his own former house. When Ford comes to Japan to bail Joe out of jail he finds himself getting embroiled in his fathers crackpot theories about what happened that long-ago day in Janjira. Joes paranoid rants turn out to be accurate scientific predictions and the semi-estranged father and son join forces to figure out how to stop the creatures--giant prehistoric monsters that feed on radiation--before they destroy Honolulu (whoops too late) and San Francisco where Fords wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde) are on the run from the impending monster beatdown. Youll notice Im alluding to monsters in the plural here--not multiple Godzillae but (spoiler alert since the marketing has shown some admirable restraint) one Godzilla plus the MUTOs (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms"") a pair of colossal praying mantis-like horrors that have emerged from crevices in the Earths crust to complete their mating ritual. Theres a lot of warm-up MUTO action before we finally get a good look at the title monster about an hour in Scary insect hook-hands ripping out bridge cables glowing egg sacs with tiny MUTO larvae wriggling inside mysterious pods dripping with slimy goo. A pair of monster experts (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins both massively overqualified) pop up as needed to make with the scientific ooglety-booglety about electromagnetic pulses and restoring the balance of nature. Top Comment Hello everyone. Thank you for your concern about whale vs. wail (vs. wale etc.).  More... -ForrestW Join In Director Gareth Edwards (a visual effects artist who made his directorial debut with the well-regarded 2010 indie Monsters) can compose a nice shot edit an action sequence with something like causal logic and even pull off the occasional mildly winking joke--all of which makes Godzillas two-hour running time bump along more agreeably than it might have. The climactic monster-v.-monster showdown in the San Francisco Bay--which the imponderably enormous Godzilla wades through like a kiddie pool--goes on too long but its full of thrilling vaguely Spielbergian shots in which ordinary bystanders including a school bus full of awestruck children contemplate the monsters sheer scale. Its too bad that the human protagonists of this are the least interesting Taylor-Johnsons stoic soldier hero and his distraught wife and son. We care that these three find each other on the basic level that were happy for reunited families in ATamp;T commercials but the script hasnt given us much more to work with than ""good-looking people who miss each other."" The scientists meanwhile are even more underdrawn. At one point a dead-serious Hawkins respectfully addresses Watanabe as ""sensei"" which made me long for a digression on the scientists backstory. But you dont go see a 2014 Godzilla reboot for the delicate character shadings and plausible story structure. You go to watch a giant radioactive lizard whale on stuff and on that score Godzilla does its work. The degree of destruction these behemoths inflict on the Japanese and American infrastructure goes way beyond your average superhero movie. With the possible exception of the Transamerica building every iconic San Francisco monument is at some point stomped chomped or otherwise casually destroyed. (I kept hoping for some Internet-economy humor like a shot of one of the creatures crashing through Twitters SF headquarters clutching a Google bus in each claw.) Though this King of the Monsters is animated digitally his sometimes-comical lumbering gait gestures at the unwieldy solidity of the original ""Suitmation"" costume. At the end his beef with the MUTOs settled this gentler less historically fraught endearingly senescent Godzilla makes his way back into the oceans depths the balance of nature restored once more--for now.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 15 2014 951AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 15 2014 1007AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Gareth Edwards Written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen Bryan Cranston Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Put it this way if your slumber at the oceans bottom had been regularly interrupted by atomic blasts for 60 years youd be cranky too. And not make a lot of sense.Such is the state of Gareth Edwards Godzilla both the movie and the Chrysler Building-sized ridge-backed dino - Japanese by birth American by corporate movie-making providence - who this time is prodded into angry wakefulness to engage in a world-shaking slamdown with two giant bat-mantis thingies bent on eating the worlds nuclear stockpiles for (three guesses) energy purposes. There are eye-poppers galore especially once the young director of the low-budget handycam horror Monsters gets his various bad-tempered behemoths lined up for the final city-toppling brouhaha. Edwards prefers his battles at night against skies roiling with clouds smoke and mist often lending the impression of prehistoric gods duking it out in weather conditions theyve arranged for their own vanity purposes.But Godzilla - both the movie and the big guy - is otherwise something of a lumpy lumbering great beast of a thing lurching from city to city continent to continent smackdown to smackdown and plot point to plot point with singularly graceless indifference to anything other than those take-home jaw-dropper shots.Anyone who cares about such things knows that Godzilla is an especially vivid metaphor for natures anti-nuclear blowback a monster who first rose from the seas around Japan sixty years ago to tear one open on those puny humans whod dared to mess so arrogantly with Mother Nature. And there are traces of this is the current Godzilla especially as the story struggles to find its scaly huge feat.Opening with the discovery of an underground monster nest that revives engineer Bryan Cranstons conviction that governments have been hiding something from the world and using the story of nuclear accident as a cover - a lie thats personal to Cranston because it cost him his wife (Juliette Binoche). The movie then shifts forward to focus on the scientists grown son Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who has helpfully grown into a navy bomb-dismantling expert just in time for all hell to break loose.Its possible youre thinking ""Bryan Cranston? Juliette Binoche? Arent they like real actors?"" And if you are prepare to be disappointed for not only are these real actors only around for as long as it takes to get the monsters up and rampaging their summary dispatch is perfectly in keeping with the movies wholesale lack of interest in the very human beings whom Godzilla may or may not have been prodded from his deep-sea slumber to serve and protect. Another sign youre not in sensitive adult drama terrain here although hes cast the charismatic David Straithairn as a high-ranking military honcho Edwards shoots the man mostly from behind as though the real attraction here was the back of his head. Godzilla gets more closeups.After establishing itself promisingly as a kind of Spielberg tribute flick replete with Cranston (whose name Dr. Brody is snatched from the jaws of Jaws) doing the nutty-professor version of Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters and lots of awe-struck staring into windy huge holes in the ground Godzilla morphs into James Cameron-style martial porn - without even having the decency to pause and be as knowingly silly as Starship Troopers or Pacific Rim for a few minutes along the way.Which leaves us with the singularly uninteresting Taylor-Johnson as our primary point of human identification. It also encourages us to sit back and pray that this time the monsters finish the job if only so they can finally get some quality sleep without being poked awake for another movie like this.

Those movies came with built-in excuses like our friendly presidents national-security state or like the fact that its the middle of May and those of us in the eastern two-thirds of the country are still dealing with PTSD from that horrible winter and here we are two weeks into ""summer movie"" season. We cant do anything about it Its the way things are Better make the best of it Those people in Hollywood (and Washington and Manhattan) totally mean well They just want us to have fun and feel safe and not hurt our brainsNo such excuses are needed for Gareth Edwards exhilarating ""Godzilla"" which arrives as more than a relief. Its a bracing tonic for the bored palate of the mainstream moviegoer and one of the most intriguing big-budget breakthrough films since Steven Spielberg made ""Jaws."" (Edwards only previous feature is the 2010 low-budget indie ""Monsters."") This is a movie of tremendous visual daring magnificent special-effects work and surprising moral gravity. Its magic lies in the big things - like the really big things which take their time showing up but are totally worth it - and the small ones. Those include David Strathairns delicate supporting performance as a U.S. Navy admiral tasked with nuking a trio of giant monsters bringing a note of seriousness and sobriety to what would be a meathead warmonger role in any other movie. When a Japanese scientist shows Strathairn his fathers pocket watch stopped dead at 815 on the morning of Aug. 6 1945 the admiral is genuinely shaken.Thats just one small indicator of the ways that Edwards screenwriter Max Borenstein and story author Dave Callaham have created a convincing world and treated its implications seriously. Its a world threatened by reawakened prehistoric beasties to whom our existence is irrelevant but it never feels like a fantasy a comic book or a franchise-starter. Instead of the ultra-fast migraine-meets-ADHD editing that reduces most big action films to total incoherence Edwards cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and their immense production team have designed atmospheric and exciting action sequences you can actually understand and that support the movies meaning rather than replacing it. Believe me theres no shortage of grand spectacle from a train derailment in the Sierra Nevada mountains to a monster-inflicted tsunami on Waikiki Beach to the near-total destruction of Las Vegas. But you always feel the suffering and destruction which some viewers may not welcome; this isnt empty adolescent apocalypse-porn in the Michael Bay style.There are several breathtaking scenes of visual poetry in ""Godzilla"" that I cant wait to see again perhaps none better than when a team of paratroopers streaming flares attached to their ankles drops toward San Francisco from 30000 feet set to the haunting buzz of Gyorgi Ligetis ""Requiem."" It made me think of the demon likened to Hephaestus in ""Paradise Lost"" who falls from Heaven for an entire day ""from morn to noon ... from noon to dewy eve"" From the frozen mists of the stratosphere the soldiers fall into sunlight and then into clouds again and then out of clouds into a gray city where shockingly a giant reptile is locked in mortal combat with a giant insect. Not only is it not ridiculous its amazing and the comparison to epic poetry isnt as dopey as it sounds. Serizawa the Japanese scientist played by Ken Watanabe (his name is a nod to Ishiro Hondas original 1954 ""Godzilla"") has already observed that compared to us Godzilla is essentially a god.Were already hearing complaints about the limited scale of human drama on offer in ""Godzilla"" and its true that buff young naval officer Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his E.R. nurse wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) make for a highly generic version of separated-couple-in-disaster-film. Im not going all the way to claiming that this is a deliberate postmodern strategy but this just doesnt seem like an important complaint. Edwards is battling against the established cliches of the big action movie in every frame of ""Godzilla"" and he uses the bland brave blankness of Ford and Elle for a purpose. Theyre only the heroes of the film in the sense that we keep returning to their struggle to survive. Neither of them brings down a giant monster with an improvised slingshot while mouthing nonstop wisecracks; neither of them demonstrates that the power of Mom and Dads love is superior to the power of a newly hatched giant energy-sucking mantis-thingummy from beyond time. (I guess those are spoilers and Im deeply sorry.) You Might Also Like Essentially the characters Ford and Elle included are there to provide back story and exposition and to lend a human scale - an infinitesimal human scale - to a story that suggests that our entire planetary history of love affairs and great novels and dance parties is just a meaningless squiggle liable to be wiped off the dry-erase board at almost any moment. Theres only one real hero in ""Godzilla"" and its the guy who can swim under an aircraft carrier in the open Pacific with the ease of a gator going under your canoe. As Dr. Serizawa explains at one point Big G is the all-time alpha predator of the prehistoric world. Nuclear testing of the 50s roused him from the oceans depths and the worlds governments have kept him a secret until now more or less. When Godzilla finally rises to his magnificent height a dripping brutal beautiful monument to the unmastered essence of nature and utters that ear-splitting roar the preview audience I saw this with lost 100 percent of its shit and no wonder. Elvis never had an entrance that good.Long before we get there Edwards has crafted a tense dense drama that borrows extensively from real history and real disasters natural and otherwise the H-bomb tests on Bikini Atoll the Fukushima nuclear disaster the South Asian tsunami. This ""Godzilla"" reboot has a slight Neil Gaiman or Philip K. Dick flavor in that it presents an alternate universe strongly resembling our own but subtly distinct. I wont say much about the plot because it features several important early twists but Ford Brody Taylor-Johnsons character is the son of a pair of nuclear scientists played by Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche who were involved in a mysterious 1999 nuclear meltdown that contaminated large sections of Tokyo. Those areas remain fenced off and quarantined today and when Ford gets back to San Francisco from an overseas tour of duty he gets an unwelcome phone call from Japan His dad now an embittered old crank in a tiny apartment has been arrested for trying to sneak back into the quarantine zone. Apparently it isnt the first time.Given the title of the movie and given that weve also seen Serizawa and his colleague Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) make an alarming subterranean paleontological discovery in the Philippines we already kind of know that Cranstons crazy theories about what went wrong in 99 arent that crazy. He convinces Ford to make one last trip into the quarantine zone to explore the family home they abandoned 15 years ago which is now overgrown with tropical vegetation and inhabited by unusually large cockroaches. This leads to the discovery of what exactly Serizawa Vivienne and the U.S. military have been hiding in the old nuclear plant It isnt good news for the human race their belief that they have it contained is incorrect and it wants to bust loose and find a mate. Oh and it isnt Godzilla. Hell be along in due course and given the unexpected powers and appetites of this newly hatched nemesis - after it encounters a Russian nuclear submarine the sub winds up in the Oahu rain forest - Godzilla as little as he gives a damn about us may be our last hope. Any number of monster movies preach karmic sermons about war or prejudice or environmental destruction or whatever; the hidden message in the genre is nearly always that we had it coming. But ""Godzilla"" never defaults to the myth of the heroic individual in which one man stands outside the mass of human mediocrity and can bring down any opponent with pluck ingenuity and a few well-timed zingers. Taylor-Johnsons character is brave and resourceful beyond any ordinary measure but the movie repeatedly makes clear that he has no shot at standing alone against these eldritch monstrosities. This is one of the few Hollywood films where a character says hes prepared to face death and you can feel how big a thing that really is.According to the pop psychology that governs Hollywood blockbusters the teenage male audience requires an impervious superhuman ego-boosting hero as symbolic salve for its immense insecurities. Im interested to see how this movie will play beyond its undoubtedly huge first weekend since it does not offer that variety of reassurance but another kind thats a bit more grown-up and harder to swallow As big as we think we are nature is ultimately a lot bigger and the consequences of our actions are likely to be things we never expected. If it takes getting stomped by a ginormous lizard to drive that lesson home at least its one hell of a lizard. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Related links By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1150pm on Thursday May. 15 2014 Thursday May. 15 2014 Thursday May. 15 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Godzilla reboot perfectly illustrates the problem that has long haunted mediocre monster movies. When the big scaly guys are on screen its a fun thrill ride. But when the humans are at the center of the action things get scary -- and not in a good way.Thats unfortunate as this revamp of the Japanese classic has so much going for it. Director Gareth Edwards is known on the cinematic underground for the creepily effective 2010 low-budget chiller Monsters. The cast is nothing if not eclectic Bryan Cranston Juliette Binoche Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins Elizabeth Olsen and a beefed-up Aaron Taylor-Johnson the formerly lanky sorta-superhero in the ""Kick-Ass"" movies.Certainly after Roland Emmerichs famous 1998 botch of the tale (the one with Matthew Broderick) the 2008 Godzilla wannabe Cloverfield and last years middling monster mash Pacific Rim the world is ready for the real deal. Not to mention there are all the best special effects that 160 million can buy. Its just too bad a better script wasnt in the budget too. Godzilla begins in 1999 Japan where Joe Brody (Cranston) a scientist at a nuclear facility is alarmed by a sudden upsurge in seismic activity. It turns out he has good reason to be worried Giant prehistoric-like creatures that live at the bottom of our world have been awakened.Part of a city is destroyed and lots of people are killed including Brodys wife though his young son survives. But Japanese officials are able to quarantine the area and put out a cover story meaning the world is none the wiser that there are monsters in our midst.Flash forward to present day and Joe is a wild-eyed obsessive trying to prove the Japanese are lying while his now adult son (Taylor-Johnson) now happily married in San Francisco to a nurse (Olsen) and with a son of his own wants him to just let it go.But then a new round of seismic activity starts and this time the Japanese cant keep a lid on it because a couple of MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms -- basically the old Japanese monster Mothra with a Hollywood facelift) are on the loose. How can mankind hope to survive? Well according to Dr. Serizawa (Watanabe) nature always provides a balance. In this case its the third creature from the deep Godzilla MUTOs sworn enemy. The U.S. Army of course just wants to nuke em all but since these things feast on radioactivity that might not work out so well.Honolulu Las Vegas and San Francisco are the monsters ports of call and seeing these towns digitally taken down is where Godzilla hits its stride. There are some genuinely tense scenes as when two soldiers struggle to stay silent on a bridge trestle while a MUTO stalks underneath. The entire Golden Gate Bridge and Honolulu train sequences are masterfully staged and so are the scenes where planes plunge from the sky. And yes Godzilla looks awesome.As effective as these moments are they cant compensate for the fact that two of the films best assets (Cranston Binoche) dont have much screen time that the acting is generally wooden (Watanabe and a totally underused Hawkins as his assistant spend the whole time just looking pained) and that our hero Taylor-Johnson is a blank bringing little to the part except an obviously successful workout routine.On top of that the script by Max Borenstein recycles monster-movie tropes without adding much new to them. The Japanese and American monster movies of the 50s tapped into Atomic Era dread. Borenstein and Edwards dont expand beyond that -- a surprise since Edwards Monsters was inventive in its social/political implications as it was set along the U.S.-Mexico border. Here the filmmakers often seem to mistake confusion and cacophony for plotting. Cary Darling 817 390-7571; Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Grade C- Remember ""Bambi Meets Godzilla?"" It packed a comic wallop in a minute and a half. The latest version of the seminal radioactive-monster myth could be called ""Godzilla Comes Down With Elephantiasis."" Im not just referring to the movies two-hour-plus length and the creatures broadening hips and skyrocketing height (hes now a whopping 355 feet tall). Director Gareth Edwards bloats the film with human figures that never spring to life and sabotage the primal story. Edwards who directed one film before ""Godzilla"" the micro-budget sci-fi mood piece ""Monsters"" roused hopes among spectacle-thriller fans when he said he would build to Godzillas appearance the way Steven Spielberg teased out the first sighting of the great white shark in ""Jaws."" But the shark made its jabbing presence felt in ""Jaws"" immediately and recurrently. Even when you couldnt see it John Williams terror-inducing music signaled its appearance and you viewed juicy human morsels from its dead-eyed point of view. The sight of the sharks fin or a string of barrels that it pulled as easily as soup cans inspired more emotion than its analogous sight in ""Godzilla"" - a view of Godzillas back as big as an island with three rows of stegosaurus-like plates churning Pacific waters. In ""Godzilla"" we get that very partial glimpse of the marvelous title character - a combination of super-sized T. rex and dragon - near the end of the nimble clever opening credits which touch on everything from Darwins theory of evolution to the creation of the atomic bomb and the detonation of fusion weapons in 1954. After that were stuck with a bunch of haunted or merely humorless Homo sapiens who eventually explain that the 54 explosions were not tests but attempts to nuke Godzilla. In this version of the saga Godzilla is no mutant; hes a primordial alpha predator who lives close to the earths radioactive core. The King of the Monsters finally rises from his throne in the deep to do battle with another radioactive behemoth that scientists have dubbed MUTO for massive unidentified terrestrial object. They continue to call it that even after it sprouts wings and flies. The first hour is tied to the destruction of a Japanese nuclear plant in 1999 (thats where we meet scientists Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) and the collapse of a mine in the Philippines (thats where we meet scientists Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins). Both these disasters are linked to MUTOs not Godzilla. Whats confusing as well as irritating is that the movie features more discussion of MUTOs than Godzilla. We learn theyre prehistoric parasites that feed on radioactive objects and emit electromagnetic pulses that can kill the power grid in whole cities. Watanabe brings gravity to the movies theme ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around."" But not even actors as gifted as him Cranston Binoche Hawkins and David Strathairn (as an American admiral) can bring vitality to characters who function like data profiles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson supplies the central focus as Cranston and Binoches son a member of an explosive ordnance disposal unit (think ""Hurt Locker"") who wants to use his bomb-disposing talents to help save humanity. Hes such a colorless personality that the script struggles to concoct action that would make him more urgently likable such as rescuing a small Asian boy during monster mayhem in Honolulu. He remains woefully bland as he heads back to San Francisco where his pretty nurse wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son wait for him just as two MUTOs and Godzilla converge there for the climax. Little imagination went into the MUTOs - theyre strictly synthetic creations. Edwards himself describes them as ""part shark part Alien Queen part Starship Troopers part gorilla."" Happily the renovated Godzilla proves charismatic combining the looks of an amphibious sumo wrestler with the head-wagging neck-crunching combat moves of bears. (See ""Bears."") This Godzilla generates surprisingly little tension from the question of whether hes a god or demon. Early on hes positioned as natures way of keeping the world in balance. Edwards shoots the action from tricky perspectives at one point filming it through Taylor-Johnsons combat visor. But subjective visuals mean nothing if they dont bring you inside the head of a character you care about. Perhaps the most crucial addition Spielberg made to ""Jaws"" was his affectionate view of American shore life in the mid-1970s. (It made you feel like humming ""Those Lazy-Crazy-Hazy Days of Summer."") As Edwards demonstrates in ""Godzilla"" its not enough for a monster movie to put humanity at risk. A director must also suggest that its worth saving.

You could argue the story fades in and out of focus as it tries to keep up with the visual fireworks.You could argue all that and it would barely matter. Because when this latest encore for your favorite giant lizard works its magic when the sweeping overhead shots and gargantuan combat sequences get into a rhythm the results send a tingle of awe to your inner movie geek. Godzillas scale and spectacle provide that rare sensation of seeing something youve never quite seen on a movie screen.If youre into superlatives -- and who isnt? -- Godzilla conjures the most jaw-dropping giant monster sequences since the original King Kong. The integration of the movies massive creatures with the cityscapes of San Francisco Honolulu and other locales represents a quantum leap for such renderings.The soundtrack fills the crevices with subtle but deafening creaks and cries. Every time Godzilla takes the screen with or without his two foes (a couple of equally destructive slightly smaller creatures looking to mate) the bar gets raised a little higher.The people dont fare quite as well though Godzilla does follow a handy blockbuster guideline Cast well and cast deep. Bryan Cranston Ken Watanabe Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen Juliette Binoche Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn are all fine actors and for the first half of the movie as the stakes are set they provide a touch of dramatic realism to counterbalance the spectacle. And heres a sort of nonspoiler spoiler Godzilla isnt afraid to kill off people that matter. Hitchcock would approve.Director Gareth Edwards has a horror masters sneaky sense of visual suspense Pencils slide down a table a dog frantically barks bats and seagulls announce the approach of something really bad. Godzilla consistently makes massive scale feel intimate.It also flaunts its influences out in the open. The opening sections featuring an archaeological dig in the Philippines and the coverup of the events surrounding an earthquake in Japan owe a debt to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The creepy viscous fossils discovered underground bear the mark of the late Alien designer H.R. Giger. The terror and awe of the interaction between people and creatures carry loud echoes of Jurassic Park.The only real failing of Godzilla lies in what it clearly wants to achieve but cant. Somewhere in here is a story of fathers and sons and family sacrifice that goes only so deep. Cranston does his part; he does anguish and anger with rare conviction. But the screenplay which handles ideas better than it does emotions lets him and his species down.The genuine resonance is reserved for the beasts. The two MUTOs (thats Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism if youre scoring at home) want to mate. Godzilla wants to hunt. There it is Love and death on a supersize scale. Godzilla may boast a monster cast but it knows the monsters are the real stars. GODZILLA (B+)Directed by Gareth Edwards.

"Review For a monster Godzilla plays it a little too cool - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review For a monster Godzilla plays it a little too cool Godzilla Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Godzilla starring Godzilla Bryan Cranston Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Ken Watanabe. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Godzilla starring Godzilla Bryan Cranston Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Ken Watanabe. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Critic Betsy Sharkey says Godzillas terrifying towering reptile is one very cool dude Its the big lizard stupid.I say that because someones clearly lost sight of the obvious when the no-name monsters get more screen time in ""Godzilla"" than the main attraction. Forgotten is the primary reason we show up in such massive numbers -- we actually want to see the big guy go stomping and tromping through cities crunching skyscrapers like soda cans breathing fire and sending the fearful fleeing. As it happens ""Godzillas"" terrifying towering reptile -- the latest in a very long line -- is one very cool dude. Hes a 21st century Godzilla eco-conscious and with 3-D side effects that are monstrous in all the right ways. Ironically this big lumbering movie could have used more not less. More Godzilla without question and more emotional content for its very good cast too.Keeping the main monster under wraps using that tension as a tease is not a bad idea. But director Gareth Edwards lets it go on too long allowing too many people problems and those other monsters to get in the way. By the time Godzilla emerges in all his gory glory you may feel more taunted than teased. Now to the reasons the beast awakens. Max Borensteins screenplay brings ""Godzilla"" into the present day lots of eco-issues hovering. Basically we have not been taking care of Mother Earth and were about to pay for it -- a good sentiment that sometimes gets lost in a plot as unruly as its monsters.

A 355-foot-tall lizard is poised to crush box-office rivals this weekend as Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures ""Godzilla"" arrives in theaters. (Ryan Faughnder) The film opens with a grainy old shot of an atomic bomb mushrooming over some remote waters one of several nods to Godzilla mythology and director Ishiro Hondas 1954 original. Now that was a filmmaker who knew how to handle his metaphors. Edwards whose attention-getting 2010 feature film debut ""Monsters"" -- low budget lots of effects -- got him the ""Godzilla"" gig is not quite so facile with those.The bad things begin in earnest in Japan circa 1999. Tremors rumble through a Tokyo nuclear power plant and unsettle one of its scientists Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston). Joe and wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) a fellow scientist hurry son Ford off to school so they can head right into work and the emerging crisis. CJ Adams plays young Ford. Aaron Taylor-Johnson soon steps in as the grown-up version the versatile actor proving hes action-hero material. Hunky yet smart sensitive and self-sacrificing. Godzilla trailer Bryan Cranston voices his frustration and fear in this Godzilla trailer. Bryan Cranston voices his frustration and fear in this Godzilla trailer. See more videos Were also introduced to two other key players in ""Godzillas"" global meltdown -- Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe the ""Ishiro"" a tribute to Honda) and his associate Vivienne (Sally Hawkins). Excellent actors who spend most of their time walking around in white lab coats and looking very concerned. Like all things ""Godzilla"" the Tokyo crisis is massive and mysterious. The first wave of lives are lost the first round of cover-ups commence and the bond between father and son is damaged.Flash forward 15 years to the Philippines. Serizawa and Vivienne still wearing those frowns are examining fossilized bones. Very big bones. Also uncovered? A deep trench from the site to the sea. Godzilla? Something else? Patience.Then its to San Francisco where Ford now a naval officer and a bomb-defusing specialist is returning home from a tour. Wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) is a nurse son Sam (Carson Bolde) spends a lot of time watching TV where ""Godzilla"" will show up as news footage at strategic moments. The very attractive couple barely get in a hug before ...The specter of Tokyo rises. Joe is arrested. Hes tracking new tremors. After 15 years of obsessing over what happened in 1999 hes more than a little unstable too with Cranston proving yet again he can find endless ways to play crazy. The film uses the new tremors to reunite father and son and sift through the fallout of nuclear accidents but not too deeply.With the set-up out of the way were about to get a serious glimpse of a monster. Not the monster mind you but at least this bad boy -- dubbed a MUTO or Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism by the military though it looks more like a super-sized Florida cockroach to me -- will get Godzilla riled up enough to make an appearance.Love is in the air and the MUTOs are stirring. As if sensing the trouble in paradise Godzilla starts some agitated ocean swimming -- the better to show off that spiky dorsal fin. The rest of the effects kick in big time as the military primarily Adm. William Stenz (David Strathairn) try to decide which monster to move on.One of Godzillas appeals has always been the duality of his soul. Though he does destroy a lot of what is in his way his intent is not evil rather frustration that the world is so out of whack. Given his size its terrifying and great fun to watch him working out his anger issues. And as he does ""Godzilla"" begins to click. San Francisco takes the biggest hit and the destruction is a thing of beauty. A shout out to special effects supervisor Jim Rygiel. A three-time Oscar winner for his work on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy he does Godzilla proud.When the big guy gets fully ramped up he goes totally radioactive. And those other monsters feed on the energy grid like Texas in the summer. Sparks fly. People panic. Monsters rage. Weapons of mass destruction are deployed. The big action sequences are where Edwards way with effects pays off helped by the films crack team which includes cinematographer Seamus McGarvey Oscar nominated for ""Atonement"" and ""Anna Karenina"" and veteran production designer Owen Paterson whose credits include ""The Matrix"" If youre wondering if Ford and Elle will find their way back to each other or whether Godzilla will save the day or destroy it dont bother. Expend that energy on better things like hoping the sequel and you know it is coming will actually let Godzilla run wild.------------------------------ GodzillaMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violenceRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Column Reviews Entertainment Godzilla (2014) Nuclear Power Bryan Cranston Related Godzillas Gareth Edwards aims for awe tears with monster reboot Godzilla stars discuss remake monster escape plan on black carpet Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-godzilla-movie-review-column.html,200,godzilla200013,godzilla2000,latimes

You know from Godzilla. Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Godzilla. You know from Godzilla. Warner Bros. Pictures This is a monster sold on a sigh. For all of the bombast the buildings falling and the brawling beasties the moment when this Godzilla is most impressive the moment he suddenly transcends his digital underpinnings and feels like a real presence is one of his subtlest and quietest. During a lull in a battle among the skyscrapers of downtown San Francisco the danger around him briefly subsides; his head droops momentarily his body heaves ever so slightly downward and he exhales quietly. The fearsome jaws knifelike talons and spiky plates on his back might scream world-destroying lizard god but that sigh just murmurs ""Im gonna need a minute here."" Godzilla is nearing retirement age with nearly three dozen movies under his scaly belt so as the franchise enters its seventh decade its fair to ask any director attempting to resurrect the series whether theres a good reason (apart from box-office grosses) to poke this particular sleeping giant. British director Gareth Edwards answer to that seems to be that its time for a return to the creatures sober serious roots after decades of rubber suits and silly monster-on-monster action. To that end Edwards demonstrates a clear understanding of what made 1954s Godzilla such an enduring story. As was the case there hes attempted to create an allegory about the dangers of militarized science and one that foregrounds the human drama while the monstrous chaos unleashed by mans dabbling in nuclear power and weaponry goes down in the background. He centers the story on one family the Brodys whose fates are intertwined with a Japanese nuclear disaster and its subsequent fallout. Bryan Cranston plays Joe an engineer at the Janjira nuclear power plant which early in the film is destroyed in a series of earthquakes mirroring the real-life Fukushima disaster. His wife dies in the accident and he becomes a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist trying desperately to prove that the official explanation for the disaster is a smoke screen. Fifteen years later hes an embarrassment to his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a military ordnance expert now with a family of his own in San Francisco. Ford has to head to Japan to retrieve Dad after a run-in with local authorities and his visit just happens to coincide with the earth starting its familiar rumbling again. Turns out Joes theories arent so crazy after all particularly to Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) a secret government scientist studying a mysterious phenomenon at the Janjira site. The characters dont quite escape the thinly drawn traditions of the standard summer blockbuster but they are full enough to provide adequate personal stakes especially with Fords desperate attempts to reunite with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son amid the carnage. Similarly the allegorical underpinnings never quite match the grace with which the 1954 Godzilla interrogates scientific ethics in a militarized age but theyre present enough to provoke at least a little thought. What Edwards is really after here is balance not just of character and meaningful story but also of spectacle. This is still a big summer tentpole after all and Edwards is committed to making a popcorn flick that thrills without sacrificing brain cells. Edwards only previous feature was the 2010 indie Monsters which impressed its small audience with how effective a monster movie could be even if it barely had the budget to really show the monsters. Godzilla has the budget but it maintains commitment to the notion that the unseen is more impressive than the seen Godzilla doesnt appear until over halfway into the film (after one nicely executed bait-and-switch) and really doesnt take center stage until the very end. When we do see him and the movies other creatures -- because this does still share some DNA with the later monster-vs.-monster iterations of Godzilla -- its most often from specific human points of view. Theyre partially obscured by goggles by blurred binoculars by smoke by foregrounded buildings. Everything Edwards does visually creates a sense of scale as compared with humans and when he does open Godzilla up to wide shots it makes him all the more impressive. Edwards willingness to not always go over the top to not try to be bigger than Godzilla is what drives restrained moments like that labored sigh or the stunningly executed paratrooper sequence teased in the poster with troops falling from the sky trailing red smoke while the eerie Ligeti Requiem made famous by Kubricks 2001 winds up the tension in preparation for another release. This is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to never short on dazzle but unafraid to let us catch our breath once its been taken away. Correction May 16 2014 We originally listed the character played by Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichikawa. His name is Dr. Serizawa. The monsters name is still Godzilla.

Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Bryan Cranston. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 15 2014 238 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Patience is a virtue and youll need lots of it during the first half of ""Godzilla"" which threatens to be a lizardly variant of ""Waiting for Godot."" First theres Bryan Cranston in full obsessive mode and a fright wig slowly sussing out a secret. No he isnt obsessed with cooking meth but with uncovering whatever it is Japanese authorities have been hiding on the site of a nuclear power plant that was destroyed by something--some thing--15 years ago. Then theres the schematic struggle between Mr. Cranstons Joe Brody who managed the ill-fated plant and his son Ford a military bomb-disposal expert who thinks his old man is completely bonkers. (Ford is played blandly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Elizabeth Olsen doubles down on the blandness as Fords wife.) When the film finally gets around to monsters on a rampage youll get both more and less than you bargained for. More because in the tradition of the 60-year-old series Godzilla is not the only oyster in the stew. Humanity must also contend in this version with giant MUTOs--massive unidentified terrestrial organisms--that look like they were sculpted by Louise Bourgeois; that feed voraciously on radiation with Paris and Las Vegas for dessert; and are in the mood for mating if not love. (You can tell from the atomic glow of their sexual organs. When these creatures are in heat they are really in heat.) And less because the star of the show doesnt have anything to do until almost an hour has drifted by. Before that we get plenty of speculation about whether hes mankinds scourge or savior. The latter notion is advanced by Ken Watanabes Dr. Ichiro Serizawa a Japanese scientist who believes Godzilla has been aroused from his primeval slumber to restore balance in nature and who advocates letting the big guy duke it out with the lustful MUTOs. And duke it out they do in a San Francisco where fires rage and panic spreads while skyscrapers fall like digitized dominoes. The climactic combat is very loud and fitfully impressive when it isnt being intercut with Strangelovian silliness about a nuclear warhead that only Ford Brody knows how to disarm. (The director was Gareth Edwards who made a name for himself four years ago with a modest but effective alien-invasion flick called ""Monsters."" Seamus McGarvey was the cinematographer.) No one can accuse ""Godzilla"" of lacking plot elements or themes. The patchwork script which is credited to Max Borenstein resonates with the meltdown at Fukushima and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004; borrows freely from official behavior in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""; separates families reunites them finds Ford a little kid to protect when hes off on his own; and offers the ingenious theory that the hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific in the 1950s werent tests but attempts to kill MUTOs. But the more elements the movie piles on the more diffuse and disjointed it becomes. Whether or not Godzilla returned to save us his series may finally be beyond salvation. Watch a clip from the film ""Million Dollar Arm."" Starring Jon Hamm Aasif Mandvi and Alan Arkin. (Photo/Video Disney) Million Dollar Arm Disneys ""Million Dollar Arm"" presents a particularly flagrant case of a true story reprocessed into a feel-good fable that rings false. A sports agent JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) needs a fresh idea that will turn his languishing business around. Hes dismissive at first when an Indian associate points him toward the world of cricket. ""It looks like an insane asylum opened up"" JB says of the game ""and all the inmates were allowed to start their own sport."" Before long though hes in India staging reality-show competitions to find a cricket player who has the right stuff to become a Major League Baseball pitcher. The movie is grimly efficient on its own terms a string of ever more naked calculations. But it looks like a business school opened up and all the marketing grads were allowed to start their own studio. The main calculation concerns the agents character traits. (I was going to say his character but he doesnt have one until the very end.) Since Mr. Hamm is indelibly identified with Don Draper the deeply flawed but still charming protagonist of ""Mad Men"" the goal here was to fashion JB along the same lines. They got the deeply flawed part right. JBs flaws start and end with insensitivity. Its funny enough in a Don Draper way that he fixates on a plastic girlfriend and ignores his lovely tenant Brenda (Lake Bell) a physician who lives in his guest house. (Ms. Bell who made and starred in ""In a World..."" is too talented and original to be trapped in the nervous self-apologetic stereotype thats beginning to define her.) But it isnt funny at all only stupid and inexplicable that he treats his Indian athletes--he finds two promising candidates plus a would-be coach--with callous neglect after transplanting them from their rural villages to Los Angeles where they flounder like the out-of-water fish they are. ""Million Dollar Arm"" works as a parable of colonial exploitation but that may not be exactly what Disney intended even though theres a brief acknowledgment that throwing vast amounts of money at unworldly village boys isnt in their best interests. The movies obsessive intention is to dramatize JBs growth from insensitive clod to the nicest of nice guys. This transformation takes place belatedly and mechanically with the help of a crusty old baseball scout played--unfunnily--by Alan Arkin and with emotional coaching from Brenda who opens JBs eyes and soul to the plight of his tender new clients ""They just need to see that you care."" I needed to see that the movie cared about the boys Dinesh and Rinku theyre played respectively by Madhur Mittal from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and Suraj Sharma who was Pi Patel in ""Life of Pi."" But theyre used as amiable sitcom props and never get to say a single word about baseball--how they feel about the new sport theyve been drafted to play how theyre able to throw a ball so well. (In fact the winners of J.B. Bernsteins real-life talent hunt had never played cricket. While the production respects that awkward fact Disneys marketing campaign suggests otherwise.) The film was directed by Craig Gillespie from a script by Thomas McCarthy though the coarse texture of whats on screen suggests that the studio imposed its iron will on two artists who have made fine independent films in the past and will surely make more of them in the future. The New York African Film Festival Watch a clip from the film ""Half of a Yellow Sun."" Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Thandie Newton and Anika Noni Rose. (Photo/Video Monterey Media) With Nigeria beset by the savagery of Boko Haram the timing would seem to be right for ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" a drama set in the 1960s during the Nigerian civil war when that nations southeastern provinces tried to secede in a doomed effort to establish the Republic of Biafra. Whats more the film now in limited commercial release stars Chiwetel Ejiofor last seen in ""12 Years a Slave"" as well as the always appealing Thandie Newton. After seeing it as part of a series of African films presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center Im sorry to report that Biyi Bandeles would-be saga based on the celebrated novel by Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie is disappointing a romance pastiche that muddles the politics of the period beyond comprehension. But the Lincoln Center series included other features and documentaries that deserve to be seen widely. Among them ""Bastards"" In Muslim countries illegitimate children are usually outcasts. Deborah Perkins feature documentary (not to be confused with the 2013 drama of the same name by Claire Denis) follows Rabha El Haimer a single mother in Morocco as she struggles for official recognition of her religious marriage which has no legal standing--she was 14 when her parents gave her away to a brute who beat her regularly. Once that is accomplished Rabha hopes her daughter Salma can have the full benefits of citizenship. The legal system moves slowly but in the end justice is done. ""Winter of Discontent"" The 2011 uprising that began in Cairos Tahrir Square is powerfully depicted in a 2012 fiction film by the Egyptian director Ibrahim El-Batout. The pace is deliberate so that the evil of the Mubarak regimes security apparatus can exude fully. (Neither the filmmaker nor his activist hero Amr played by Amr Waked could have guessed that the apparatus would survive the revolution intact.) The torture scenes are chilling but so in their way are the workings of the state-run television station which tries to keep a lid on a boiling cauldron by spewing shameless lies. ""Sarraounia"" This fascinating dramatic film by the Algerian director Med Hondo was produced sumptuously in 1986. Its a fictionalized account of the reign of Queen Sarraounia who battled French colonialists at the turn of the 20th century in what is now Niger. The French come off as contemptible swine. They arent defeated by the queen as much as by their own moral corruption but Sarraounia (Ai Keita) tall and supremely self-confident is a formidable force who enunciates a stirring credo. ""Our community is tolerant"" she declares. ""Everyone lives according to his customs and principles. Worship any god you please--sky earth fire lightning or the crocodiles. Pray any way you like. Your soul is your own responsibility.""

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it In this latest version of the monsters tale Godzilla has been around for 60 years before tearing into San Francisco. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) By Michael OSullivan May 15 2014 ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwardss 2010 theatrical debut ""Monsters"" hardly lived up to its name. Though technically a sci-fi flick the British filmmakers first foray into creature features was basically an opposites-attract love story set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world beset by (barely glimpsed) aliens. If only it were more of an old-fashioned horror movie I wrote something featuring more monsters -- and cooler ones -- ""it might be a bit better than it is."" Be careful what you wish for. With Edwardss reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic (last rebooted in a mediocre 1998 update starring Matthew Broderick) the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. ""Godzilla"" not only has more monsters -- three to be precise -- but theyre way more interesting than any of the human characters. First mistake killing off Juliette Binoche before the butter has even congealed on my popcorn. Second mistake casting Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn and then giving them nothing to do. And whats with Bryan Cranston? As everyone knows by now from the trailer he plays doomed nuclear engineer Joe Brody a conspiracy nut obsessed with the Japanese governments cover-up of a 1999 nuclear-plant disaster ever since his wife (Binoche) was killed by a ball of radioactive steam. In his performance here the Emmy Award-winner chews through more scenery than the titular lizard. After a few demented early scenes with him ""Godzilla"" winds up in the far less capable hands of . . . Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Yes yes he was fine as the teenage nerd in the ""Kick-Ass"" movies. But as Joes son Ford an Navy ordnance expert who gets swept up in his fathers battle to save humanity the British actor -- all grown up and hunky -- registers as just another piece of Hollywood beefcake. Fortunately the monsters are actually kind of a kick. And isnt that why you go to see a movie like this anyway? In addition to Godzilla who the grainy opening credits reveal has been around since the 1950s there are two new creatures. Dubbed MUTOs for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms theyre giant buglike things that make a guttural clicking sound and feed on nuclear weapons. (Sometimes they use their mandibles. In one dimly lit scene one of them appears to shove a warhead between its legs. Ew.) One of them -- the male -- flies. His mate is carrying an egg sac filled with dozens perhaps hundreds of considerably less massive but even more terrifying babies. The film centers on Mr. and Mrs. MUTOs attempt to settle down and raise a family. At the same time we humans are trying to figure out a way to kill them that doesnt also kill us. And the movie is called ""Godzilla""? Trust me theres a reason he gets top billing but it would spoil the fun to explain why. In any case the MUTOs alone are worth the price of admission. Theyre nasty hard to kill and extremely destructive. The film boasts handsome CGI animation not just in the creature department but also in the plentiful scenes of mayhem which involve train derailments collapsing cranes and cooling towers as well as picturesque havoc on the Golden Gate Bridge. This Godzilla is ready for his close-up and he looks pretty great in Imax 3-D. The plot such as it involves humans centers mainly on Ford a hero whose attention keeps getting diverted from his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) to his father to his kid (Carson Bolde) to the MUTOs to Godzilla and back to Elle again. Though credited solely to writer Max Borenstein (""Swordswallowers and Thin Men"") the ""Godzilla"" screenplay derives from a story tweaked and retweaked by four other writers including Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption""). If anything it suffers from a form of ADHD. To be sure ""Godzilla"" is cheesy cliched and shallow. Though it exploits our fears of environmental calamity it gives short shrift to any deeper message. As Watanabes scientist character opines sagaciously before resuming his expression of concerned dismay ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around."" Thats a thought about as deep as Godzilla swims when hes cruising sharklike through the ocean his dorsal spikes rising ominously out of the water. Like the movie theyre primitive but effective weapons.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains frightening mayhem and destruction. 123 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Theres a large degree of faint praise in that assessment. The film is technically remarkable and takes its title character seriously. Hes come a long way from those 1960s Toho Studios cheapies starring a guy in a rubber beanbag suit doing pro wrestling elbow drops on dragon-monsters. The best movies in the 60-year-old series made the monster an archetype for each age. In Ishiro Hondas melancholy 1954 film Godzilla was a radiation-breathing symbol for post-Hiroshima atomic angst. Director Gareth Edwards epic reboot is a climate-change disaster allegory with the spiky city-stomper a stand-in for ecocatastrophes unleashed by heedless humanity. While the film doesnt achieve the level of Christopher Nolan gravitas and Spielbergian spectacle it aspires to its ambition scope and scale are commendable. The opening credits are smart sharp and telegraphic a swirl of old grainy military footage and redacted government documents that pack a kiloton of exposition into a tidy package. Some of that cleverness carries through in the film proper. Wisely it waits an apprehensive eternity before gradually revealing Godzillas scaly gigantitude. And its battle scenes are well-paced. Unlike ""Transformers""-style endurance tests theyre abrupt cataclysmic and over before your fingernails have quite ripped through the armrests. However -- and this is a 30-story ""however"" -- even blockbusters with world-class technology need emotional magic. Its stirring moments succeed despite thinly drawn characters. It roars yes but too often mumbles and repeats itself. Its attention to the human details is wobbly at best. The screenplay reportedly was worked over by a battalion of uncredited writers including Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption"") and it feels quite patchwork. The storys humans remain uninteresting stock types -- stoic military commander steely serviceman protective mother absent-minded scientist. Warner Bros. Elizabeth Olsen as the wife of a Navy weapons expert beholds ""Godzilla."" The quick way to get us emotionally invested in cardboard characters is to give them a child to protect. This is a strategy the film repeats with slight variations a half-dozen times. I havent seen this many waifs since the orphanage scenes in ""Annie."" With a prologue set in 1999 we meet the first among these threatened families the Brodys. Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) are scientists advising the operators of a Fukushima-like nuclear power plant near Tokyo. The Happy Birthday banner crayoned for dad by their 10-year-old son Ford goes unnoticed as the couple race off to work. Following a seismic event that breaches the nuclear core that very day the boys family life is forever ruptured. Ford grows up to be a square-jawed U.S. Navy weapons expert (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) deeply invested in his own marriage (to Elizabeth Olsen) and son. Hes gone years without seeing Joe who remains in Japan looking for clues to what he insists is a coverup of the earthquakes real cause. When the present-day scientific team of Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins finds signs of life in the ancient egg of a huge spider-pterodactyl-whatzit Joes suspicions begin to look plausible. Its just a matter of time before iconic city skylines from Honolulu to Las Vegas are torn asunder. The plain old human beings come off as afterthoughts to smashathons. Cranstons Perform-O-Meter starts at 11. He wants us to know that whats happening is tragic Tragic Watanabe ably performs The Spielberg Stare(tm) upward-tilted face agog with wonder. Taylor-Johnson sleepwalks through the kind of blandly attractive guy role that would have gone to the pre-""Green Lantern"" Ryan Reynolds. Will you have fun watching this movie on opening weekend with friends? No doubt. Will you remember it in a year? Dubious. Irony of ironies this ""Godzilla"" leaves a shallow footprint.

Kimberley French This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Aaron Taylor-Johnson left and Elizabeth Olsen in a scene from ""Godzilla."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Kimberley French) Italian mega-producer Dino De Laurentiis famously explained the appeal of ""King Kong"" ""When the big monkey die everybody cry."" Japanese audiences have a similar investment in Godzilla. The original 1954 film (titled ""Gojira"" in its homeland) echoed the lingering toll of the war in Japan a decade earlier. In later cheesier monster movies radioactive behemoths like Godzilla and Gamera evolved into friendly protectors of baseball-hatted schoolchildren.The latest Hollywood version of the Godzilla story is neither fun nor fearsome. Its an empty spectacle in which the humans are as meaningless as the monster.The opening scene of scientists discovering some kind of massive hatchery offers false hope for a ""Close Encounters""-style tale about a terrifying discovery; yet its almost a full hour before we meet the big guy face to face. Before that were introduced to sleuthing nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston); his sailor son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson); Fords nurse wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen); and token Japanese scientist Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe). Dr. Serizawa has reason to fear that ""nature is out of balance"" and that spikes in underground radiation indicate a huge creature is about to go on a rampage. No not Godzilla but an insectoid giant dubbed a Muto.When the Muto escapes from Japan the authorities (almost all of whom are Americans) are able to cover up the damage as an earthquake but by the time the monster and the military converge on Hawaii the rabid cat is out of the bag. Director Gareth Edwards whose previous flick was the low-budget creature feature ""Monsters"" has an uncanny knack for not portraying how real populations would react to catastrophe. The CGI devastation (in badly retrofitted 3-D) is interspersed with a few images of a wide-eyed girl and a runaway dog yet theres no believable sense of global panic. Its almost laughable when late-for-work Elle tells her son (Carson Bolde) to turn off the news broadcast about Honololu being decimated and then its downright offensive to show oblivious gamblers beneath a headline-news feed in Las Vegas -- where the Muto has a date with a special lady. Amid these missed opportunities to depict a detailed collision between the human and natural worlds Godzilla swims to the rescue -- specifically to San Francisco where Ford shows up with a battleship full of nukes. (Wait till the censors see what the amorous lady Muto does with one of the warheads.) The inscrutably wise Serizawa persuades the military to let the monsters duke it out. Yet while Godzilla roars and the city is incinerated were supposed to focus on Ford reuniting with Elle and on his sons school-bus full of bratty kids outrunning the cops.Theres a word for the kind of technocratic brains behind ""Godzilla"" unbalanced.What ""Godzilla""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 203  Content Intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Godzilla (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Godzilla (PG-13) An exciting and fresh take on a familiar monster. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/15/2014 Editor rating 3 In Godzilla director Gareth Edwards sets out to revive something that has practically disappeared from big-budget Hollywood spectacles A sense of awe. Instead of revealing his hand right from the start and then trying to top himself a la Transformers or Pacific Rim Edwards makes you wait for the good stuff teasing you along the way with crumbs but keeping his main attraction offscreen until the second half (Spielberg is an obvious influence here specifically Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind). Everyone knows an enormous fire-breathing lizard is eventually going to emerge from the ocean and stomp on puny humans. But by raising your expectations and making you anticipate the stars entrance Edwards ramps up the excitement so the payoff is even bigger. Here finally is a giant monster movie made in the anything-goes CGI era still capable of making your jaw drop. Thats not to imply the first hour of Godzilla is all set-up and talky exposition. Working from a script by Max Borenstein who cleverly pays homage to the 1954 original and the sequels that followed the movie opens in 1999 Japan when a nuclear reactor disaster sets the plot in motion. The film then flash-forwards to the present-day and the consequences of the accident become evident. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche play nuclear scientists; Aaron Taylor-Johnson is their U.S. Marine son who is married to Elizabeth Olsen. Ken Watanabe is another scientist who may know more than hes letting on and David Strathairn is the American military commander whose resources are about to be sorely tested. The previews for Godzilla have thus far done a stellar job of preserving the movies plentiful surprises so you wont get any plot summarizing here. The performances are fine even though the characters are on the thin side the way they always are in this genre (Taylor-Johnson and Olsen do exactly whats required of them which is to make you care for them as a couple and hope they manage to survive the carnage). Edwards whose previous (and only) movie the low-budget Monsters centered on the effects of an invasion by giant aliens uses the big-bucks studio resources for ingenious setpieces and scenarios such as a suspenseful sequence in which a train must cross a trestle bridge while a huge creature is hiding in plain sight from the audience and the characters. And when the director finally pulls back the curtain on the big guy Godzilla eschews the rapid-fire editing of most contemporary blockbusters and lets you take in the monster and the disasters hes causing in long uninterrupted takes (Edwards version of Godzilla is so humongous this is the rare movie that really deserves to be seen in IMAX 3D; the sense of size and dimension is astounding). Unlike Roland Emmerichs lousy 1998 take on the character this new Godzilla plays everything seriously although the film is littered with funny Easter eggs for the hardcore fans. The picture doesnt quite cross over into must-see territory; Godzilla cant impart the shock of novelty the 1954 version had (and just last summer we had Pacific Rim). But Edwards manages to balance the monstrous with the human to engaging effect The movie is a cartoon and it doesnt leave much of an imprint but watching it is a blast and Edwards proves he knows how to craft a memorable image or three. This is an impeccably made movie. See Godzilla on the biggest screen you can and youll come away tickled if not entirely entranced. And the film manages to appropriate a Japanese cinematic icon with the utmost respect and care paying homage to its roots while relocating the action to America.

Picture Warner Bros. Image 10 of 10 Godzilla review Smashing success - but lacks humanity 1 / 10 Back to Gallery Godzilla Action. Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Bryan Cranston. Directed by Gareth Edwards. (PG-13. 123 minutes.) ""Godzilla"" that tail-swinging menace from the deep is back along with a pair of friends in a movie that comes in two distinct waves. The first wave is all people; the second wave longer is all monsters - and also people looking up at monsters and running down the block screaming. Theyre screaming in Japan then in Honolulu and then in Las Vegas. And just as youre thinking about the Golden Gate Bridge the monsters are tearing through San Francisco too swinging tails and crushing buildings. After all why go to the beach to stomp around when every metropolis has a downtown just waiting to get destroyed? Well leave it to the psychiatrists to figure out why our most popular entertainments in recent years depict the toppling and smashing of our landmarks. Is this a healthy outlet for fear or some mass neurosis thats so widespread; no one calls it what it is? In either case whats particularly weird about ""Godzilla"" is that for long stretches all it shows is destruction. We get the obligatory context followed by monster fights - just stuff getting smashed and knocked down. Perhaps in five years action movies will stop pretending and just dispense with context altogether. Theyll simply fade in on a couple of monsters fighting and show them banging into things for two hours. When we get to that point ""Godzilla"" will be hailed as a significant step in that direction. Yet for the first 45 minutes ""Godzilla"" promises to be something better than that. Bryan Cranston plays a scientist in Japan working in a nuclear plant and like all fun characters at the beginning of a monster movie he notices something on his computer ... something very wrong. Theres a pattern of some kind and it doesnt make sense. It doesnt have to. All we need to see is Cranston bugging out growling and showing his lower teeth and we know things are really really bad. In those first 45 minutes ""Godzilla"" has everything a monster movie needs. Theres the one man who knows the truth. Theres a monster of legendary proportions. And there are painful and dramatic encounters between human beings. Its pretty clear that nobody broke the news to Cranston that ""Godzilla"" was slated to be a throwaway summer movie. Hes red-faced terrified anguished enraged - he plays every scene like its the last season of ""Breaking Bad."" But this is a summer movie despite whatever the calendar might tell you and so the focus must switch to younger characters. So we get Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Cranstons son a lieutenant specializing in disarming bombs and Elizabeth Olsen as his wife. Unfortunately nobody bothered to write either of them a personality probably on the assumption that it doesnt take much charm to run full out while stealing the occasional backward glance. In fact thats when individuality is needed most. Its too vague to ask an audience to care about the fate of humanity but every ""Godzilla"" movie must have at least two people you absolutely positively do not want to see get stepped on. This has no one. Taylor-Johnsons idea of playing a military guy is to have a stone face and all Olsen gets to do is fret. Perhaps director Gareth Edwards concentrated too much on the action to worry about the performances. In any case for at least 75 minutes of the movie theres not a single moment of human peril thats made vivid or consequential. Its all just spectacle whether its people or buildings getting destroyed. For some spectacle will be enough. The visuals are impressive - these days they usually are. In addition to Godzilla there are two flying monsters a male and a female who thrive on radiation and cant wait to mate. Las Vegas faux Eiffel Tower is knocked over like its a toy and the Golden Gate Bridge is mauled. In one scene we get a shot of Honolulu from what remains of a high-rise and the devastation looks like Warsaw at the end of World War II. The movies big visual showpiece is a monster battle taking place in downtown San Francisco. Its just monsters breaking things in a powdery haze of pulverized plaster and to its credit the scene really does look as if its actually happening. Still without any human participation of any importance its hard to get worked up about any of it - and thats even if you happen to be watching the movie in downtown San Francisco.

Inside Halseys Troubled Past Chaotic Present Godzilla By Peter Travers May 15 2014 More News How an Indie Director Built a Better Godzilla Alexandre Desplat Talks Godzilla Score All Stories >> Say this for the big guy The camera loves him. The new Godzilla best seen in 3D IMAX to revel in his textured scales his heaving gills his deafening digital roar is a rock star the effing real deal in FX monster cool. Godzilla has come a long way since he (actually a dude in a rubber suit) starred in the 1954 Japanese original that spawned 27 spin offs plus comic strips video games and a titanic turd of a 1998 Hollywood remake. In the last third of this lumbering reboot the latest Godzilla springs to life and wakes up the wide-eyed kid in all of us. More News How an Indie Director Built a Better Godzilla Alexandre Desplat Talks Godzilla Score All Stories >> Why the wait? Gareth Edwards the Brit director making a leap from his 2010 indie debut with the low-budget Monsters is following the lead of Steven Spielberg in Jaws. That means you withhold the shark or the Zilla as long as possible and in the process build suspense and a rooting interest in the characters. Spielberg pulled it off triumphantly. Edwards does not. Hes hamstrung by a script by Max Borenstein from a story by David Callaham that never met a cliche it didnt like. The topheavy plot kicks in when Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his partner Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins) chopper into a Filipino mine where they discover a pod containing a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) and evidence of another MUTO that has escaped. In Tokyo engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his scientist wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) work in a nuclear plant whose product is mothers milk to the MUTO. Cue the tremors. Start the explosions. Jump ahead 15 years to Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) Joes son an explosives expert working for the Navy in the person of Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn). Ford thinks Daddy is crazy preferring to spend time in San Francisco with his nurse wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and their young son Sam (Carson Bolde). And then at Honolulu Airport Godzilla shows up on a rampage. It would take an insomniac to wade through all these plot complications without dozing. The actors are top-tier but they over-emote to sell a human drama that never rises above soap opera. Cranston deserves better than a script that confuses hysterics with breaking bad. Luckily Godzilla and those punk MUTOs finally go at it full romper-stomper. Nothing equals the original films use of Zilla as a symbol of the Atomic Age. But seeing the scaly dude side with Mother Nature against the freaks is almost worth enduring the blather that precedes it. I said ""almost.""

Comments click to enlarge Godzilla Video Rated PG-13  123 minutes  2014 Mise-en-scene the art of telling a story through visual composition more than editing rarely comes up in discussion of Hollywood blockbusters. In the age of green-screen technology and computer graphics its increasingly difficult to distinguish production design from special effects and even when you can the settings of these films are typically uninspired. In Peter Jacksons Tolkien adaptations and in most of the Marvel Studios output (to name two popular examples) the environments never look quite inhabitable however impressive they may be on a technical level. One can easily imagine walking around in the palpable richly textured worlds of the original Star Wars trilogy or the musical spectacles produced by Arthur Freed at MGM in the 40s and 50s (Meet Me in St. Louis Singin in the Rain). But modern-day blockbusters often seem to exist under shrink-wrap inviting spectators to look but not touch.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A prehistoric creature threatens modern-day civilization. Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence) BOTTOM LINE A slapdash crash-and-bash treatment of the iconic movie monster. He looks bigger and more expensive than ever yet somehow seems diminished. CAST Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen Bryan Cranston LENGTH 203 My how hes grown. The star of the latest ""Godzilla"" movie has come a long way since 1954 when a nuclear bomb disturbed his prehistoric slumber and sent him rampaging through Tokyo. In reality he was a guy in a foam-rubber suit crushing tiny buildings and chomping on Lionel trains but the effect was captivating -- so much so that ""Godzilla"" spawned dozens of sequels over the decades most of them driven by scenes of diorama-scale destruction. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? The latest Godzilla is a bigger and costlier monster even more than when we last saw him in 1998 opposite co-star Matthew Broderick. Godzilla towers over todays taller skyscrapers (made not of balsa wood but of pixels) and his distinctive metallic bray now resonates in seat-shaking surroundsound. Somehow though the iconic movie monster feels diminished in this multimillion-dollar disappointment. For starters Godzilla barely appears in ""Godzilla."" A long backstory involving an ill-fated Japanese nuclear plant (Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche play married staffers) introduces a raptor-like creature nicknamed MUTO for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism. This monster which has magnetic-pulse powers and can fly (isnt that a MUFO?) is the one threatening civilization specifically picturesque San Francisco. Thats where solider-on-leave Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is heading to rescue his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and their young son Sam (Carson Bolde). The characters are even thinner than the plot and they all wear out quickly. As the MUTO demolishes other tourist towns like Honolulu and Las Vegas director Gareth Edwards (2010s ""Monsters"") repeatedly cuts away from the action -- a confoundingly strange decision in a ""Godzilla"" movie. Seriously what else are we paying to see? Certainly not Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his near-silent assistant (Sally Hawkins) trying to explain monster behavior to Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn). 232 MoviesGodzilla trailer When Godzilla fully reveals himself in a climactic battle that wavers between WWF slapstick and ""Braveheart"" pathos we havent spent enough time with him to care. The film doesnt really care either. As a character the original Godzilla was born from genuine horror -- his Japanese creators were thinking of Hiroshima Nagasaki and the Bikini Atoll -- but here hes just another generic city crusher. Though updated and inflated hes as devoid of personality as the humans underfoot. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A prehistoric creature threatens modern-day civilization.

Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ----- GODZILLA DIRECTOR GARETH EDWARDS ON NATURES POWER In ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards presents a cautionary tale about environmental collapse and the dangers of nuclear energy. An early flashback to a reactor meltdown in Japan recalls the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster that devastated the east coast of Japan -- which the director admits could surprise audiences expecting pure summer movie bombast. ""Our film doesnt preach"" Edwards said. ""But we tried to respectfully show that we opened a Pandoras box when we started doing all this stuff. Obviously our monsters are metaphors and theyre never going to really appear but we should be very careful in terms of this amazing power of nature that were trying to control. The reality is we cant always contain it."" 030 MoviesMovie trailers Edwards aspired to give ""Godzilla"" the same poignancy as the crowd-pleasing sci-fi cinema by George Lucas Steven Spielberg and James Cameron that initially inspired him. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Im always looking for the bit where they [the audience] might tear up"" Edwards said ""even if its not tearing up in a sad way just that youre so much in awe of what youre looking at that you get goose bumps and you start to well up."" -- Los Angeles Times Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Lets get this out of the way Did we need another Godzilla? With more than 30 movies to choose from--the last American adaptation came in 1998--it wouldnt seem so. But this new 3-D version directed with verve by Gareth Edwards more than justifies its existence. Mr. Edwards has Ken Watanabe playing Serizawa--a nod to the mad scientist in Ishiro Hondas original 1954 version. His Godzilla is loud and grandiose at times but its also an elegant understated and welcome approach to the kaiju genre. Godzilla  (3/4 stars) Written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham Directed by Gareth Edwards Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Bryan Cranston Running time 123 min. Mr. Edwards knows how to build suspense. He waits some time before giving us a full-body shot of the giant lizard emerging from the Pacific to tower over the island of Oahu. By this time a pair of giant parasitic bug-like creatures--referred to as MUTOs or massive unidentified terrestrial organisms--have run amok in search of radiation to hatch their eggs sending electromagnetic pulses through the ground. Honolulu and Las Vegas are razed as the bug-like creatures make their way to San Francisco for an epic Mothra-like showdown with the King of the Monsters as Godzilla is also known. (In the cartoonish 1998 version which pales in comparison to this rendition you wince when the Chrysler Building comes tumbling down though maybe not so much when Madison Square Garden is incinerated.) Mr. Edwards previous film Monsters was a low-budget effort about tentacled alien invaders--dangerous but harmless if left alone. Godzilla may be a city-stomping jump from his indie roots (and indie budget) but he stays with his theme painting a sympathetic portrait of the lizard. And he does it without sinking into mawkishness though a love story between Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen feels overwrought. Mr. Edwards doesnt shy away from humor either. Its tough not to laugh when Godzillas imposing anthropomorphic figure is first shown and that feels intentional You get the sense the director is in on the joke. Is he--she?--really all that bad or just too big? This is the question behind most Godzilla films. If your tail is large enough to knock over the Eiffel Tower it might mean youre a clumsy lizard not a mass murderer. If a helicopter whizzes by your ear and you swat at it as you would at a gnat it could just be that you were taken off guard. In Godzilla Mr. Edwards sides with the monster.

"Godzilla A city shaker roars back to life review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGodzilla A city shaker roars back to life reviewDirector Gareth Edwards wants to do more than make our eyes bulge and our popcorn crunch.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. May 14 2014GodzillaStarring Bryan Cranston Aaron Taylor-Johnson Juliette Binoche Elizabeth Olsen Ken Watanabe David Straithairn and Sally Hawkins. Directed by Gareth Edwards. 123 minutes. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. PGCinemas largest superstar roars back to life with Gareth Edwards stirring Godzilla reboot no small feat considering how badly the big guy had been stomped.Rolands Emmerichs bilious 1998 remake of Godzilla killed all hopes the creature could lumber intact into the 21st Century. Sold with the ad line ""Size Does Matter"" the biggest thing about the 98 film was how dumb it was and also how unfaithful it was to decades of monster movie lore. Critics panned and audiences yawned at this radioactive bomb.Article Continued BelowNo haz-mat suit is necessary when approaching Edwards Godzilla. For the most part the British director maintains fidelity with 60 years of pop-cult tradition regarding this glorious brute -- the grey skin back spikes and atomic breath are backAt the same time Edwards is careful not to let bigness get in the way of the story even though his city-shaking mutant dino is fatter and stands a third taller than Emmerichs while also being twice the size of the Toho Studios original. We dont even get our first good look at Godzilla until near the one-hour mark but the tease builds anticipation.Edwards wants to do more than make our eyes bulge and our popcorn crunch. Its a philosophy he previously pursued for his acclaimed 2010 indie debut Monsters which envisioned a future no-mans-land across the U.S.-Mexico border where giant alien creatures roam free. Monsters was more about the human drama in part because Edwards didnt have much of a budget to spend on computer-generated critters.For his studio-backed Godzilla hes still more interested in the people running away from a behemoth than he is in the beast itself despite having a considerably bigger budget to throw at the screen.So we get a lot of preamble before the thrilla from zilla by way of tense family drama involving Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. They play crusading nuclear scientist Joe Brody and his heroic soldier son Ford who almost single-handedly must alert the planet about impending doom even though most people natch dont believe it at first.The skeptics include Ford who grumbles about his dads ""crackpot cuckoo theories"" until giant feet and teeth start rearranging landmarks from Bikini Atoll to Las Vegas and from Honolulu to San Francisco. Juliette Binoche and Elizabeth Olsen play the concerned wives of Joe and Ford and the film also features Ken Watanabe David Straithairn and Sally Hawkins as scientific and military types whose job it is stand stare and shout when needed. The casting is almost too good since the story credited to Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham (The Expendables) doesnt always serve the talent. Watanabes scientist character is reduced to a cipher one who for the most part simply gapes in astonishment. Lets hope that he and other underutilized actors will have larger roles in the sequels which now seem inevitable and even welcome.The film also assumes perhaps vainly that most viewers already know about Godzillas mythic origins and the bruisers somewhat ambivalent attitude toward humanity which makes it both villain and hero depending on circumstances. True to the Godzillas Japanese roots theres also a back story about how mankinds carelessness with the environment has unleashed this hell. The 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami and subsequent radiation breach at the Fukushima nuclear plant is recalled in a terrifying and all-too-realistic dramatization of the folly of messing with Mother Nature.For most of the first half of the film we get mainly tantalizing glimpses of Godzilla and its new sparring partner a giant insect parasite called MUTO -- short for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism -- that eats radiation for breakfast and which also has a yen for snacking on public transit vehicles submarines and other moving objects.The MUTO seems to be related to the fast-evolving creatures of the Alien and Prometheus franchises especially their lethal desire to reproduce.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (The Avengers) follows a peep-show esthetic putting viewers in the position of watching through a window or down a street as the monster mash unfurls. This strategy works particularly well in a scene where a school bus full of students waits in horrified anticipation for approaching terror. But when the time comes to stop the fan dance Edwards makes sure Godzilla is ready for its close-up letting out a mighty roar directly to camera. The theatre literally seems to shake.You could accuse this dino diva of chewing the scenery in multiple ways especially when it finally decides to show the MUTO why its known as ""the King of the Monsters.""But then Godzilla is a genuine legend one well served by Gareth Edwards and it deserves to play the ham.

Director Gareth Edwards (203). PG-13 Mayhem. Opens Thursday night. In 3-D. Wow Godzilla is really showing his age. Some 60 years after he first stomped on Tokyo the big green lizard has been given fresh scales for the rebooted ""Godzilla."" Yet despite a few fiery breaths theres mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it. Worshipers at the Church of Godzilla hold sacred the original 1954 film from Toho Studios. An obvious metaphor for Hiroshima and mans abuse of nature the initial movies serious cred was buried as the franchise became a beastly version of All-Star Wrestling with ol G-La fighting villains like Mothra Rodan and King Ghidorah. He became an antihero (and a dad) and even survived a 1998 remake in which he was a mutated komodo dragon. The superlizard knows how to make a big entrance in Godzilla. (Warner Bros. Pictures) This ""Godzilla"" nods to that first film then adds needlessly complicated twists. Like the 98 remake credits show Eisenhower-era atomic blasts near the Bikini Atoll -- and stop reading now if you want a bit of mystery. We jump to 1999 as a scientist (Bryan Cranston in a goofy wig) watches a seismic tremor in the Philippines destroy a nuclear facility and kill his wife (Juliette Binoche). Hes sure the cause of it is being covered up. Elizabeth Olsen spots trouble ahead in Godzilla. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Fifteen years later the scientists son Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a military explosives expert. He sees his dad warn again of some mysterious force in the ocean. Sure enough a giant egg is found under the facility. Human interference brings two huge prehistoric mantis-creatures to the surface. The scientists call them M.U.T.O.s -- Mutant Unknown Terrestrial Organisms. They absorb radiation and drain the power from everything around them. One can fly. They raze Las Vegas and San Francisco -- but their frenzy awakens the hibernating dorsal-finned ocean-dwelling snouty gargantuan that monstrologist Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) calls Godzilla. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins suit up for some science. (Kimberley French) The arrival of our short-armed brand-name beast takes an hour though director Gareth Edwards gives coy glimpses. Once Godzillas on the scene the battles between the giants are fun up to a point. They eventually get dull -- and respectable actors go B-movie bad. Elizabeth Olsen playing Brodys wife does not have a good ""look at that giant monster"" face. David Strathairn (""Good Night and Good Luck"") is a supercalm military commander and Sally Hawkins (""Blue Jasmine"") is Dr. Serizawas assistant. When echo-location devices reveal a monstrous shape under the sea she says ""Do you think its him?"" CGI not foam-rubber suits brings the monster to life in Godzilla. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Oh its him all right and the cosmetic facelift on Godzilla -- done via CGI that nods to the old foam-rubber ""suitmation"" -- is honorable. The reptilian wreckers screech-roar still resonates too but as in the 1960s he has no beef with humanity. He should He ends up a supporting player in his own underwhelming movie.

I hated the 98 version of Godzilla but I would take it over this one. This is one of the worst movies ever made. The special efect in particular the ""MOTO""s were awful putting modern day CG and trying to make it look like stop motion. Whats the point in that? acting was bad script was bad directing was ....yep you guessed it...bad. I give it an F for fail Adriansaid on Sunday August 24 2014 74553 PMI fell asleep in Godzilla movie.

It was a well made thrilling good quality movie. Lots of people saw and liked it and it should be more compared to Jurassic Park and movies of that nature. Because it was a movie about Godzilla it was derided by fans of the Japanese movies which I feel are low quality anyway. NickyWhatsaid on Friday May 16 2014 80455 AMHi Richard Roeper Just wanted to say that I am pleasantly surprised you gave this movie a pretty high rating Im actually seeing it today on its release and as a LONG time fan of Godzilla since I was a kid I am glad to hear positive remarks aimed at the film Aside from wanting more Godzilla would there be anything else you;d have changed or like to have added/cut?

To experience vicarious terror as tiny humans cower and perish before the onslaught of nightmarish natural forces? Well theres some of that I guess. Is it to nod in appreciation over an updated exploration of nuclear anxiety in the wake of Fukushima? To delight in the perfectly pitched performances of fine actors like Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe in an old-fashioned monster movie? Um not so much. Anyway Godzilla is now the only alpha predator besides man who doesnt eat what he hunts. But somehow he still exists to restore the balance to nature -- even if that means saving humanity and its practice of nuclear fission. Bonkers and boring. Oh well.

"Godzilla | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; godzilla_2762 ) Godzilla (United States/Japan 2014) May 14 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Where Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin failed spectacularly Gareth Edwards has succeeded. Although the 2014 edition of Godzilla isnt the be-all and end-all of monster movies its a respectable big-budget effort. Most importantly for legions of fans across the globe its a Godzilla movie honoring not only the look and feel of the Big Green Lizards most famous outings but paying homage to his entire history. Many of the wrongs committed by Emmerich and Devlin are corrected here. If only the 3-D had been abandoned... This incarnation of Godzilla transpires in the same universe where at least some of the Toho Godzilla movies were set. It explicitly references the 1954 debut feature and refers to the title creature by the name of ""Godzilla."" At the very least that should allay some of the die-hard fans worst fears that this movie might continue from where the universally despised 1998 film left off. That GINO (Godzilla in name only) has not been exhumed from its shallow grave. In many ways Godzilla is a cousin to Edwards earlier movie Monsters in that it focuses more on the ineffectual humans than the monsters. Godzilla is a force of nature like a hurricane or a tornado. Men can prepare for him and execute search and rescue missions but theres not a lot they can do to stop him. And while were treated to several epic lizard-on-giant insect skirmishes these are observed from the human vantage point. The movie is about Godzilla but its not viewed from Godzillas perspective. The movie takes its time with the big reveal keeping Godzilla mostly hidden until about midway through the movie. The early scenes transpire 15 years in the past in Japan where unexplained tremors are threatening the integrity of a nuclear power plant. The husband and wife team of Joe and Sandra Brody (Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) are tasked with investigating the situation and preventing a disaster. Later in the present day the Brodys now-adult son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) finds himself in the same part of the world facing a similar situation. But this time things go beyond the ground shaking and collapsing. A huge insect-like creature mutated by radiation rises up and wreaks havoc before going in search of its mate. And an unknown creature out to sea attracted by the activity begins to make its way toward land. Las Vegas Hawaii and San Francisco end up in the pathway of one or more of the monsters. Godzilla offers a slow build-up punctuated by various teasing moments many of which pay homage to classic monster movies. It provides us with the time and opportunity to get to know the humans before the monsters start rampaging. For Ford we get a fairly compete backstory seeing him as a boy facing the evacuation of his home and the destruction of his lifestyle then as an adult with a family of his own. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isnt asked to do much more than be an all-around good guy willing to sacrifice himself - a role he capably fills. Juliette Binoche makes the most of very limited screen time. Bryan Cranston despite looking odd with a full head of hair offers a considerably toned down performance from what Breaking Bad viewers might expect. Elizabeth Olsen soon to join The Avengers alongside Taylor-Johnson is wasted as Fords wife who has pretty much nothing to do except look worried. One of the greatest points of interest especially among Godzilla fans is whether Edwards version of the creature honors its roots (which the Emmerich/Devlin incarnation didnt) - something it achieves. The Godzilla of this movie is strongly based on the 1954 version but without the ""man in a suit"" element. This looks how one might expect a giant radioactive dinosaur to appear in this age of top caliber CGI. The iconic roar has been changed to make it deeper and more ""throaty."" In general the special effects are excellent although its baffling why this was post-converted to 3-D. I know I sound like a broken record but it adds nothing. To the extent that summer movies are all about mayhem and destruction Godzilla delivers everything expected of it and perhaps a little more. At the very least it argues that Hollywood can deliver a Godzilla movie without completely screwing up. Monsters postulated that Edwards might be the man for the job and Godzilla has vindicated his selection. The movie has its weaknesses (the build-up is too long and some of the subplots could have been truncated) but it works. This may not exactly be the Godzilla I grew up with but its a more than acceptable upgrade.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 218 p.m. EDT May 16 2014A scene from ""Godzilla.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)""Its not the end of the world"" says Elizabeth Olsen who plays a nurse in Godzilla. Shes talking about her husband (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) taking off for Japan to see his jailed scientist father (Bryan Cranston).But she could just as easily be referring to the monstrous mayhem that comes soon after threatening global annihilation. Either way shell come to eat those words.Godzilla (    out of four; rated PG-13 opening Thursday night in select cities and Friday nationwide) has an impressive cast though few are given the chance to shine. In a movie about a legendary beast humans -- no matter how talented -- are secondary to the main event.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersCreature features are all about gargantuan snarling monsters and great balls of fire not awards-worthy performances. And the titular leviathan is a majestic beast indeed.British director Gareth Edwards wisely builds dramatic tension by letting the story unfold at a stately pace also following the hallowed Spielberg playbook. Think Jurassic Park meets Jaws. The film gathers momentum early drawing viewers in from the artful opening credits. Audiences are compelled to wait for the big reveal. About an hour in the fierce-looking Godzilla shows himself in all his terrifying glory. Its a riveting spectacle.Edwards pays respect to Ishiro Hondas original tale. The story honors the legacy of the 1954 classic and its symbolic connection to the atomic devastation of World War II.The retooled story also resonates in contemporary times with shades of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster hanging over the film.At 355 feet Godzilla towers over previous screen incarnations. A reptilian Goliath with a jagged spine he may look like a dinosaur and lumber like a gorilla but he roars with a dragons fiery breath.An extended family is at the core of the story. In 1999 tremors shake up a nuclear power plant near Tokyo where Joe Brody (Cranston in a bad wig) and his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) are scientists. They live near the plant with their young son Ford (CJ Adams). Joe detects unusual sounds in the seismic activity which his colleagues dismiss as earthquakes. A meltdown ensues and Sandra is killed.Earlier scenes focused on a caved-in mine in the Philippines where scientists Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) discover fossilized radioactive remains.Cut to 15 years later Ford (Taylor-Johnson) is now a Navy lieutenant married to Elle (Olsen). They have a 4-year-old son Sam (Carson Bolde).Joe remains obsessed with figuring out the source of the power plant disaster. He learns of a government cover-up Something is feeding on nuclear reactors. Serizawa labels it a MUTO or massive unidentified terrestrial organism.Serizawa clashes with bomb-happy Admiral William Stenz (David Strathairn) citing the arrogance of humans who try to control nature.Fortunately for humanity this new iteration of Godzilla is about restoring order -- though the explanation for it is murky.A behemoth meant as natures imposing defense weapon Godzilla glides in the Pacific with a gators stealthy grace then stomps out to set things straight. When he battles malevolent winged monsters its an epic clash filled with chilling growls bellows and metallic-tinged wails.The climactic fight grows a bit wearying and plot holes loom. Cleverly though destruction is not always shown head-on; sometimes its glimpsed through a hazy airport window or car windshield.Godzilla 2014 is a more somber and frightening reboot than the cartoonish 1998 movie. Disaster sequences are not slap-happy destruct-a-thons but emotionally devastating and horrifying as originally envisioned.Aiming for a titanic tale that is also seriously ominous Godzilla opens with a bang and concludes with an exhilarating roar. 265 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1goHBIK",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/14/godzilla-review/8321681/,200,godzilla200034,godzilla2000,usatoday

Entertainment Inc. For his 60th birthday the old Japanese dinosaur gets a dawdling American version of epic destruction The trailers -- here here and here -- were great. They showed glimpses of devastation a long trough of earth clawed by some huge beast on its way to the sea; a high-rise building with a bite taken out of it; the Statue of Liberty missing its raised arm. We saw flashes of You Know What the Big G as flare guns briefly illuminated its scales plus the metallic crab foot of another giant creature crashing onto the street of a city it was in the process of leveling. The sound track crackled with prehistoric roars a keening choir and the urgent warnings of scientists in the know. ""You have no idea whats coming"" Bryan Cranston screams. ""It is gonna send us back to the Stone Age"" Sally Hawkins when asked if this It is a monster whispers ""No. A god."" Even a movie critic is allowed to hope. This one dared dream that English director Gareth Edwards whose only previous feature was the low-budget post-apocalyptic sci-fi film Monsters might show the same ingenious savvy in updating the Godzilla brand that Rupert Wyatt also from the Brit indie scene displayed with the 2011 Rise of the Planet of the Apes -- a witty rethinking of and improvement on a venerable fantasy franchise. If ingenious simians could be reborn why not a dinosaur awakened from a hundred-million-year snooze by nuclear tests? (READ Corlisss paean to Rise of the Planet of the Apes) Ishiro Hondos original Gojira opened in 1954 and was released a year later in an Americanized version as Godzilla King of the Monsters. (Nice coinage by the way God + gorilla to link him to King Kong.) Surfacing from his cold deep storage this 200-ft.-tall metaphor for Atomic Age anxiety snacks on fishermen from remote islands then comes to Tokyo to be a star carrying all the modern stars baggage nasty disposition need to demolish things insatiable appetite for mischief. The big brute spawned 27 Toho sequels in which he devolved into a friend and defender of children and a 1978 animated series from Hanna-Barbera. Twenty years later director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) imported him to New York City -- an expensive lazy remake. Somebody figured that for the first films 60th birthday the mutant deserved to live again in all raw majesty. Nope. Edwards Godzilla dawdles toward its Doomsday climax; the movie could win a prize for Least Stuff Happening in the First Two-Thirds of an Action Film. The title character looks imposing in the CGI work of Peter Jacksons Weta Digital sorcerers but the movie is often so dark using a palette of gray and brown as if coasted in rust that hes hard to see. (The sound effects do most of the scary work.) And he gets little screen time. Godzilla isnt even the main monster he is the referee rival or enabler -- we wont say which -- to a pair of other creatures. And the human drama mostly involving Joe Brody (Cranston) his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) never clicks. The problems of these three little people dont amount to a hill of beans when San Francisco is getting Sanforized. (No spoiler alert needed for the news that the creatures never get to New York Harbor to disarm Lady Liberty.) (READ Lights Gamera Action -- a tribute to Japans other favorite movie monster) David Callaham who scripted Sylvester Stallones first Expendables movie wrote this films story which was poked and polished by a trio of pricey scribes David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight Man of Steel) Drew Pearce (Iron Man Three) and Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption The Walking Dead). The only screenplay credit goes to Max Borenstein (Swordswallower and the Thin Man -- no we havent seen it either) but the movie carries echoes of the debate that must have gone on during rewrites. We have an iconic monster but whats he to do? And How can we get audiences to care about the humans fleeing from him? The final film doesnt answer those questions doesnt fill the two-hour running time. Its a concept lacking a magnetic story a package without a product. In 1999 Joe Brody is the sensitive American sensei at a Japanese nuclear power plant. An unknown catastrophe requires the plant to be shut down endangering Joe and Sandra and leaving their young son stranded. Fifteen years later -- right now -- Ford is an Army officer with expertise in bomb disposal and Joe is still pursuing his conspiracy theory about the cause of the plant meltdown. Like Kevin McCarthy in the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers which matched Gojira as a vibrant Cold War parable in sci-fi garb he is the lone sane man in a world myopic to the truth; his research got him a serious prison term. When Ford comes to Japan to get Joe out of jail father persuades son to join him in the supposedly radioactive waste of his 1999 life. Back home Joes wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) had reassured him with a smiling ""Its not the end of the world."" But she doesnt know shes in a disaster movie. Joe does and now Ford agrees with him. (FIND Gojira and Invasion of the Body Snatchers on TIMEs list of Top 10 50s Sci-Fi Films) I may have erred by making the emotional dialectic of this Brody family seem as fraught and compelling as that of the Brody clan in the first two seasons of Homeland. This one is strictly formula plus shouting. Cranston plays Joe with so much high-decibel huffing and such a preposterous hairpiece in the 1999 scenes that the Emmy committee may consider rescinding his Breaking Bad awards. And Taylor-Johnson the young English actor so fine in Nowhere Boy Kick-Ass and Anna Karenina can invest only the terse strength of a War on Terror combatant. (Toward the end we learn hes the only bomb-disposal expert available to the Army in all of Northern California.) When not fighting to keep the world from ending Ford is shepherding lost children out of peril -- the cheesiest stratagem for an audiences sympathy. But youre no more interested in the people than the screenwriters were. You want to know What about the new monster? Thats the Muto (for Massive Unidentifiable Terrestrial Organism) a flying insect that snacks on radioactivity looks like a spawn of H.R. Gigers creature from Alien -- in other words like most sci-fi creature villains since that 1979 classic -- and has an appetite for destruction. But no personality for all its ferocious power in demolishing property values. The Muto could be an earthquake a hurricane or a tsunami on stilts. But when the creature eventually finds a mate it provides the movie with its one fabulous weird moment. For purposes of reproduction the male gives the female a nuclear warhead which she inserts inside her body -- leaving the moviegoer to wonder Is she using the warhead as a suppository or a dildo? (SEE More monsters in the all-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies) The two Mutos you see were born in the 1950s near sites of atomic testing the male in Japan in 1954 as collateral damage from a deep-sea mission by the U.S.S. Nautilus the first nuclear-powered submarine; and the female in Nevada where the government tested its H bombs. References abound to other nuclear events from Hiroshima in 1945 to the Tohoku quake and tsunami three years ago. Plenty of action films have exploited the World Trade Center nightmare. This one leaps halfway around the world and a decade ahead for a different tragedy from 9/11 to 2011. Either way these movies say its all our fault. As Godzilla scientist Ken Watanabe notes ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way round."" All these political implications are for screenwriters and critic to purr and wrangle over. Every other moviegoer just wants to see the end of the world threatened and averted. This coming weekend with that simple pleasure in mind millions will be off to see the lizard. I may be in the minority disappointed by Godzilla because the trailers teased me into expecting too much. Anyway Ive decided to bide my time and stoke my fervor for the next Natures Revenge movie the Matt Reeves sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes due July 11th. My spring optimism proved groundless; but for this critic hope summers eternal. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Daily Edition Login to download Godzilla Film Review 900 AM PDT 5/11/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS On a second try Hollywood does the behemoth justice. Almost. TWITTER British director Gareth Edwards brings the iconic Japanese monster back to the big screen in Legendarys revival of the classic creature. The king of movie monsters has grown bigger than ever -- in size as well as in the budget resources and zealous seriousness devoted to his exploits -- in this grandiose celebration of his 60th birthday. Even older than James Bond and with more films to his credit Godzilla has never before been accorded the sort of lavish respect that the talented young English director Gareth Edwards bestows upon him here and its almost too much; as if he were an elderly stage star being deferentially treated the title character barely shows up until the second act. PHOTOS Godzilla Over the Decades Superbly made but burdened by some dull human characters enacted by an interesting international cast who cant do much with them this new Godzilla is smart self-aware eye-popping and arguably in need of a double shot of cheeky wit. Domestic commercial prospects look very strong for this final co-venture between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures but even better overseas; in a potentially apt comparison the studios Pacific Rim did 75 percent of its business outside North America. Its not that a Godzilla movie cant be made with the utmost seriousness; to the contrary the original 1954 Gojira seen today in its fully restored version now being distributed by Rialto is beyond serious to the point of startling grimness in its forthright allegory of the nuclear age born in Japan just nine years earlier. The monster began life as neither good guy nor bad guy more as a terrifying force of nature unleashed by the new technological frontiers of warfare. STORY Box Office Godzilla Roars in Early Tracking Through 28 Toho productions over the years Godzilla became generally more cuddly and human-friendly as he took on a string of adversaries although he occasionally reverted to rampant destructiveness when Tokyo needed another trampling. He also became camp and silly at times and the first stab at a big-budget American studio version by Roland Emmerich for Sony in 1997 was so thoroughly embarrassing that the Japanese declared it not to be a ""genuine"" Godzilla movie. That will not be the case here. Edwards who was selected to direct on the basis of his exceptional 2010 debut Monsters a micro-budgeted sci-fi drama resourcefully shot throughout Central America and on which the British director created his own special effects knows his Godzilla lore. With story writer David Callaham and screenwriter Max Borenstein Edwards takes pains to re-establish Godzilla and his new nemeses as products of the nuclear era first with a nifty little opening credits reel of vintage atom bomb test footage climaxed by a quick glimpse of certain kaiju. Jump to 1999 and radiation is detected in a huge mining pit in the Philippines where Japanese scientist Serizawa (Ken Wantanabe) and his cohort Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins) are among those who go bug-eyed upon discovering a skeleton far bigger than a blue whale. In coastal Janjira Japan American couple Joe and Sandra Brody (the intriguingly matched Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) are scientists working at the local nuclear power plant where some increasingly strong tremors officially blamed on earthquakes. Joe suspects otherwise but too late as whatever is down below shakes things up so badly that the entire facility is reduced to rubble. VIDEO New Godzilla Trailer Pits Godzilla Against Other Monsters Fifteen years later Joe and Sandras only child Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has grown up to become conveniently enough a bomb disarmament expert for the U.S. Navy. His father has stayed behind in Japan all these years and has all the earmarks of being a crackpot a looney whose tiny apartment is crammed with would-be evidence of a government cover-up of what really happened at Janjira. When Ford arrives to bring him back home his old man shows him that the quarantine in place for 15 years is another sham warning that something is ""going to send us back to the stone age."" That something is a M.U.T.O short for a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism a giant long-legged black-and-red creature whose Praying Mantis-like body is topped by a triangular head rather resembling that of Godzillas late 60s opponent Gyaos. Once this critter is out of the box the fun really begins as do the series hallmarks The military figures who have to pretend they have an idea how to fight such a foe mass panic during the wanton destruction of major cities and landmark sites and the eventual toe-to-toe battles between titans of monsterdom. Given the improvements over the toy-like technology the scientists had at their disposal during Godzillas 1950s to 60s heyday the Navy personified by David Strathairns admiral determines that the M.U.T.O is heading due east that is straight for Hawaii. After some frisson-inducing looks at Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field Edwards builds to a great set-piece that of a monster-provoked tsunami hitting Waikiki Beach. Along the way we crucially learn that the M.U.T.O not only likes but needs to eat nuclear devices (bombs rockets torpedoes) popping them in his mouth like popcorn and thereby enriching his store of fuel and that Godzilla is on his trail. Next stop is Las Vegas no doubt because the M.U.T.O can have a feast at the nearby Yucca nuclear waste facility while having a little side fun trashing the Strip. Wittily Edwards shows much of the destruction via the live TV coverage that the rest of the world sees which has the effect of making the attack seem more banal and somehow palatable. VIDEO Gareth Edwards Talks About His Approach to Godzilla Reboot With the M.U.T.O so firmly established from the outset as the great villain any ambiguity about Godzillas status is quickly dispelled; even more hes branded as an ally of the U.S. by virtue of his traveling alongside the Navys vessels on the way to California (cant the creature swim faster than a ship can move?). The government with key help from the conveniently skilled Ford decides the only way to stop the M.U.T.O and her newly arrived companion whos in a mating mood is to transport some nukes by train to San Francisco which is where the ultimate showdown takes place. Humans be damned its two against one the 335-feet-tall Godzilla the biggest anyones ever seen duking it out with the atomically charged insects from the Golden Gate Bridge over to the financial district (San Francisco in general and the Golden Gate Bridge in particular have been especially popular targets for destruction in movies of late in MegaShark vs. Giant Octopus Monsters vs. Aliens Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Pacific Rim in the last five years alone). As a shrewd judge of creature-related suspense and mayhem Edwards well knows not to reveal too much monster too early; certainly the original Godzilla was seen sparingly in the 1954 film until late-on. But you want to see more of him than you do; after all hes the title character the calling card the main attraction and youd like to get a sense of his abilities in a couple of teasers that could have been judiciously placed along the way. A bit thicker around the neck and bigger chested than the Japanese original (but nothing like the silly lizard-like revamp in the Emmerich film) this is one impressive kaiju but it would have been good to see him in action for more than what feels like about two rounds. If and when this Godzilla returns for further installments it would be imperative to see more of him. Generally Edwards honors the trust invested in him taking his responsibility seriously delivering the action goods and bringing it all in at a well-paced two hours. Where the film lets down is in the interpersonal scenes with the younger characters which engage virtually no interest. Crucially Ford is a bore a cookie-cutter beefcake figure interchangeable with any number of roles played in recent years by Channing Tatum Taylor Kitsch and others. Taylor-Johnson attracted favorable notice playing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy and to a lesser extent in Kick-Ass but his character here is standard-issue military hunk. Elizabeth Olsen has a thankless role as his often frantic wife. Aside from Cranston whos all charged up as the overwrought scientist who pries open the authorities deeply hidden secrets most of the other distinguished castmembers are a welcome presence but havent much to play. By contrast craft and technical contributions are absolutely splendid in all respects. Composer Alexandre Desplats score fulfills the generic requirements but often goes beyond them to add extra excitement and grace notes. Opens May 14-15 (Europe) May 16 (  U.S.) (Warner Bros.)

Its kind of a mating ritual. The world probably wishes theyd stuck to dinner and drinks.It does involve feeding namely the consumption of nuclear power. As we learn from the backstory a scientist named Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) years before was present for a natural disaster -- so the authorities say -- that destroyed the Japanese nuclear plant he helped run. In the present he is still in Japan still searching for answers and generally considered insane by his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a soldier who returns to his San Francisco home on leave to visit his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam (Carson Bolde).A scene from the 2014 film ""Godzilla."" (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Its a short-lived visit; Joe has been arrested in Japan raving that the conditions from the previous disaster are repeating themselves that something big is up.Hes right of course. Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) have been harboring a secret along with the worlds governments for decades.Without giving too much away lets just say that all those experimental nuclear explosions in the 50s werent what they seemed.Naturally the action is eventually going to center on San Francisco and naturally Ford is going to play a major role in it. This is a movie after all. And like most ""Godzilla"" movies the monster has a somewhat ambiguous role. Is he good or bad? (Be sure to look for the cable-news headline toward the end which is funny but no more ridiculous than anything CNN has blared about the missing Malaysian jetliner the past few weeks.)Its all about the balance of nature as Serizawa reminds us repeatedly. Nature doesnt really have heroes and villains. But movie audiences crave them so we look for them anywhere we can find them even in a giant scaly lizard who steps on buildings when he feels like it.The thing about ""Godzilla"" is that despite a fight at the end for most of the movie we have to look too hard.Review Godzilla 3 starsDirector Gareth Edwards.Cast Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen Bryan Cranston.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

If you are likely to complain about spoilers and want to keep yourself in a state of complete and virginal innocence it might be best to return after viewing the movie. Americas newest Godzilla is the feel-good movie of the year. True until the last 20 minutes its choppy and withholding (Can we see Godzilla for more than two seconds -- pretty please????) but the climax Cowabunga Heres the setup An altruistic humongous monster battles two meanie humongous monsters while the hero attempts to keep a bunch of monster eggs from hatching and also disarm a nuclear warhead. Downtown San Francisco goes down baby. The final exultant deathblow is indescribably satisfying. (""Suck on this"" it could be captioned.) Go you crazy monster go The first section isnt terrible. It features run-of-the-mill monster-movie foreplay but its always fun to know (having seen the coming attractions) what the characters dont. Were in the Philippines 1999. A foreman leads two scientists (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) into a titanic underground cavern (""Ive been diggin holes for 30 years Ive never seen anythin like it"") where theres a pocket of radiation and what might be fossilized eggs. (""This one looks broken ... like something came out of it"") Then were in a Japanese nuclear power plant where Bryan Cranston under dark luxuriant locks confronts strange seismic activity and as things go boom tries to keep his scientist wife (Juliette Binoche) from perishing. ""15 Years Later"" his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a U.S. Marines specialist (""My job isnt dropping bombs -- its stopping them"") married to pretty Elizabeth Olsen. He has just arrived home (San Francisco) after a long absence when a call comes from Tokyo. His dad -- now a fanatical troublemaker convinced the government is hiding something big bad and radioactive -- has been thrown in jail. When Ford gets to Japan its clear there are unnatural forces at work Cranstons hair has become even thicker. Worse the seismic patterns are similar to the ones observed 15 years ago. Something is talking Cranston tells his son and something else is answering back. The audience by now is primed for the best CG FX ever Show us the money In 2010 director Gareth Edwards amazed the world with a micro-budget giant monster picture with the generic titleA Monsters. Presumably he had 100 times the bucks for Godzilla but he holds to the strategy of less is more. On one level thats laudable. Monsters was better for what we didnt see. So was Cloverfield which got away with depicting a giant-monster attack on New York City entirely through the lens of a video camera carried by ordinary citizens -- it was The Blair Godzilla Project. In Godzilla Edwards goes heavy on refraction a piece of a mammoth spidery leg landing in the foreground a spiky tail sliding between skyscrapers a reflection of a demonic head in the window of a moving train. He does the Spielberg thing of dollying in on people whose eyes are goggle-y from what theyre seeing. Children clutching adults hands are especially effective subjects and so is Elizabeth Olsen with her waifish peepers on that flat wide face. Edwards puts her at the forefront of crowds where she really registers like a round-eyed-kitten painting. The problem is that he --A unlike most modern sci-fi directors who throw so much CGI at you that they make miracles cheap -- seems peculiarly stingy when its time to deliver. The buildup to the first creature a spiderlike thingie with flaming slits for eyes and the endearing acronym M.U.T.O. (for ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"") is like a Gypsy Rose Lee striptease. Godzilla shows up later also one bit of (green scaly) skin at a time. In an already-notorious bit of fightus interruptus Godzilla and a M.U.T.O. begin to go at it -- finally -- whereupon Edwards cuts away to soldiers locking and loading military commander David Strathairn arguing strategy with Watanabe and Ford trying to make himself useful by tagging along after the bomb in case anything goes wrong. Wont someone remember the monsters? Taylor-Johnson is noticeably not up to his big moments and Watanabe and Hawkins are barely filled in. The only engaging character -- played by Cranston -- makes an early exit a semi-relief given his cringeworthy coiffure. I was ready to write off Godzilla as the biggest dud since ... well Roland Emmerichs 1998 Godzilla in which the lizard was boringly anatomically correct and though male capable of bearing little Godzillas. (Any creature that would travel halfway around the world to lay its eggs in the middle of Madison Square Garden does not seem equipped -- Darwinianly speaking -- to survive.) But then at long last Edwards decided to get unreal. I loved the shot included in the earliest teasers and trailers that kicks off the last act Ford and fellow soldiers leap out of a plane and down to the besieged city -- a blackish inferno -- to the eerie Ligeti music from 2001. The two M.U.T.O.s make whoopee and then snatch up the nuclear warhead as if its a baby-shower gift. (They feed on radiation.) The sound designers give Godzilla the voice he deserves -- a roar that is also a nuclear shriek. I confess that however much I enjoyed the boffo finale I was taken aback by the upbeat slant. The 1954 Japanese Gojira (which I wrote about at length here) was made when the trauma of the A-bomb was fresh the title creature an unholy fusion of reptile and radioactive automaton the movie a vision of nuclear Armageddon that remains the most somber giant-monster picture ever made. The new Godzilla by contrast is sunny-side up. The slant isnt entirely new In later Japanese films the big lizard joined forces with Mothra Rodan etc. to foil extraterrestrials. (You could say the Japanese finally learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.) But Edwards and Co.s reassuring message is tone-deaf to our own time. The M.U.T.O. were created by destructive human technology but Nature they say is self-correcting a Higher Power that dispatches an agent from the depths to protect us from the consequences of our arrogance. Its a sci-fi version of Psalm 68 Our Godzilla is a God of salvation. This article appears in the May 19 2014 issue of New York Magazine.

"Godzilla review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Godzilla  1/2 Video Godzilla is not only clever but you may shed a tear Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli discuss the new ""Godzilla"" film. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli discuss the new ""Godzilla"" film. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In one fell swoop and a pretty swell fell swoop it is the new ""Godzilla"" makes up for the 1998 Godzilla movie the one with Matthew Broderick up against the sea beast klutzing around New York like Jack Lemmon in ""The Out-of-Towners."" The latest ""Godzilla"" fine and fierce removes the camp (though its not humorless) and takes the smartly considered step of not over-exploiting its star.Already it has become the water-cooler topic for this unusually classy summer picture Is there enough Godzilla in ""Godzilla""? Folks there is. There is just enough. For one thing Godzillas not the only creature wreaking havoc in Japan and America. For another theres such a thing as pacing oneself if one is a Godzilla movie. While it does indeed take close to an hour for the prehistoric being to get his first full-on gangway-world-get-off-of-my-runway close-up director Gareth Edwards lays the expository groundwork nicely and hands the audience what it craves in the second half. ""Godzilla"" tells two tales one of a nuclear family reuniting the other of a more literally nuclear family working through its problems by fighting it out. The premise of screenwriter Max Borensteins script taken from a story by David Callaham rewrites cleverly the Godzilla lore as we know it. Earths most radiant yet most marginalized shut-in first seen in 1954 was not it turns out awakened by atomic testing in the South Pacific. Those A-bomb blasts were intended to kill or at least contain the beast. The new ""Godzilla"" begins in 1999 in a Filipino mining quarry where disruptions to the earth in the name of capitalism have generated unusual seismic readings. Scientists played by Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins discover a pair of massive sacs attached to a skeleton of ... something. One is empty and theres a trail from the quarry site leading to the ocean. The other intact but threatening is whisked to an undisclosed location near Las Vegas.In the manner of Steven Soderbergs ""Contagion"" the human character roster in ""Godzilla"" isnt neatly divided into obvious impervious protagonists and clearly marked villains biding their time before their death scenes. Following the late 20th-century prologue the pictures early scenes focus on a married pair of nuclear power facility workers played by Bryan Cranston (terrible rug even with a 160 million production budget) and Juliette Binoche. What first appears to be a plant meltdown is of course being caused by the radiation-seeking monster. The disaster leaves the couples son devastated; 15 years later hes a U.S. Navy explosives expert played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson whose wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and child are separated from the films nominal hero as things heat up in San Francisco and the monster-on-monster smack-downs arrive. Those who loved last years ""Pacific Rim"" which reveled in an all-star series of cage matches are the ones destined to be most frustrated with ""Godzilla."" I found that pileup entertaining but crowded. Here theres room for a creature or three to breathe and bide some time in between clashes. The director thinks visually which sounds redundant until you realize how many monster movies are flat effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect the paratroopers jump scored (wrongly I think) to a famous piece of music used in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" imparts the same sense of vertiginous thrill as a view from a railroad trestle bridge looking downward at a river of flaming debris.There are weaknesses starting and ending with Taylor-Johnson whos dull in a crucial but dull role. I find the screenplays attempts to make us care about the humans rather touching which isnt the same as saying the characters crises are dramatically vital. But so much of ""Godzilla"" works on a sensory atmospheric level the workmanlike material cant kill it.Edwards sole previous feature ""Monsters"" was made on a budget of less than 1 million and concerned an alien invasion. In that modest but satisfying debut Edwards played peekaboo with the audience keeping its monsters under wraps until they were truly necessary. Now working with a budget approximately 160 times larger Edwards surely felt the pressure of commercial expectations regarding ""Godzilla."" Even so the film has the air of confident almost serene folklore. Theres a full complement of computer-generated effects (duh) but the battle scenes never arrive quite when you expect. Glimpses of horrendous destruction are often captured on television screens or witnessed from behind airport terminal windows. When the Watanabe character says the big line -- ""Let them fight"" -- youre good and ready for a fight. While Edwards has a few things to learn about handling human-based dramatic sequences its heartening to see a couple of big producing entities Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures take an intelligent risk on a relatively untested director. mjphillipstribune.com ""Godzilla"" - 3 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence)Running time 203Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Godzilla (2014) Reviews Aaron Taylor-Johnson Ken Watanabe Bryan Cranston Elizabeth Olsen Godzilla a creature of his time Scene from Godzilla Godzilla Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-godzilla-review-20140514,0,3595449.column",200,godzilla200039,godzilla2000,chicagotribune

Share Tweet ""Size does matter"" bragged the ads for Godzilla Roland Emmerichs 1998 attempt to convert the most famous of Japanese monsters into a Hollywood heavyweight. But the slogan and the awful movie it was selling miscalculated Size matters yes but not nearly as much as proportion. For something to look truly profoundly huge it must be convincingly placed next to something tiny. Thats a lesson that the makers of this new and improved Godzilla have clearly taken to heart. Gargantuan creatures duke it out against smoldering skylines but almost always from the perspective of human witnesses--the little people gazing in terror from street level or out of the windows of a school bus. The audience as a result feels like its standing right there next to them at ground zero a bystander to the city-leveling bouts. Were a long long way from guys in rubber suits trampling on model buildings.Both conceptually and dramatically Godzilla preserves a human dimension though it may prove better at placing viewers alongside its civilian cast than making them care for the characters that arent as tall as skyscrapers. To achieve intimacy within the framework of a bank-breaking spectacle the studio tapped director Gareth Edwards whose only qualification for the gig was a low-budget creature feature called Monsters. Not that the lack of experience shows Edwards makes the leap to the majors with confidence adapting his grounded approach to sci-fi to a much larger scale. In many respects his true source of inspiration is not Tohos vast library of kaiju flicks but the elemental event movies of Steven Spielberg. Godzilla borrows the delayed gratification of Jaws the towering menace of War Of The Worlds and a commingling of fear and awe familiar to any Jurassic Park fan. It is if nothing else a better and less slavish imitation of the masters moves than Super 8.For a while Edwards even seems to be recycling the broken-home pathology of Spielbergs most soulful works. The film begins in 1999 with scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) losing his wife (Juliette Binoche) in a nuclear power-plant mishap. Flash forward 15 years and the boy of the family Ford is now a Navy man (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) estranged from his increasingly obsessive father. Cranston pours himself into his stock role bellowing accusations with scary conviction and mournfully sifting through the wreckage of his abandoned home a la Walter White. One could imagine a whole movie built around this compelling broken character; soon however scenery-chewing duties pass to literal scenery chewers as the Japanese authorities accidentally release an ancient behemoth onto the world. As more humongous beings (including the title one) rise from the depths of the Earth and the military starts strategizing Ford makes his way home to his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young child in San Francisco. Guess where the monsters end up convening?In some respects this new Godzilla is as much a Roland Emmerich movie as Roland Emmerichs Godzilla. Edwards crosscuts among cities and supporting players staging panoramas of mass destruction as a typically trigger-happy commander (David Strathairn) argues with a reluctant researcher (Ken Watanabe whose character shares a name with one of the protagonists of the original Godzilla). Yet while Emmerich possesses a clear apocalypse fetish turning mass collateral damage into weightless CGI spectacle Edwards takes a more empathetic approach His eye-level set pieces keep the focus on the human lives being threatened by the monsters resulting in fewer numbing depictions of cities going boom. The director also proves himself a superb purveyor of eye candy staging several instantly memorable scenes a nighttime attack on Honolulu a siege at the Golden Gate Bridge and a scene of paratroopers plummeting into an ashen fire-red war zone godlike combatants looming in their periphery. He excels at the small details too using rolling pens the same way Spielberg used a cup of water--to tease the arrival of his main attraction. Speaking of which Godzilla himself is a marvel of state-of-the-art craftsmanship looking bigger and bulkier than he ever has before and shaking the whole theater with his timeless metallic bellow. Despite a few fleeting references to Fukushima the monster is not much of a nuclear allegory this time out; Edwards sees him more as a mythological wonder--what Watanabes gravely philosophical scientist describes as an ""alpha predator."" As a result this Godzilla doesnt tap into deeper cultural anxieties the way its 60-year-old ancestor did. Nor does it engender much dramatic investment in its hero Conveying little in the way of terror or awe Taylor-Johnson is much less expressive than his towering co-stars. (The human-sized approach means less when the human in question is so mechanically driven.) Yet as pure popcorn entertainment Godzilla delivers plenty of goosebumps; the rest of the summers prospective tent poles will have to work hard to dwarf its pleasures. Size may not be the only thing that matters but it counts for something in a mega-budget blockbuster.

Godzilla is the movie monster with the mostest. King Kong may be just one gorilla-chest-hair behind but not even the greatest of apes can quite match the half-dragon half-dinosaur who first stomped and chomped his way through Tokyo in Ishiro Hondas 1954 Toho Co. Ltd. extravaganza Godzilla. In that picture -- even more so than in the sliced-and-diced retelling featuring Raymond Burr released in U.S. theaters two years later -- our hulking scaly friend embodies the kind of existential rage most of us never dare to express. Bigger than life sadder than the sea hes a being created by mans mistakes Nuclear radiation has made him what he is an origin story with an all-too-vivid real-life parallel. And so he stumbles through the city on a mindless bender thrashing at power lines and crushing tiny houses beneath his mighty clawed toes. Clumsy unreasonable and disconsolate he is us on a very bad day. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - That first Godzilla and that first Godzilla spawned dozens of spin-offs including an overblown 1998 Roland Emmerich epic; for a time he was ubiquitous and unstoppable. But if he was irritable in 1954 Tokyo Gareth Edwardss new desecration of his legend should make him want to eat Hollywood for lunch. This latest Godzilla features lots of actors you might really want to see -- people like Bryan Cranston Juliette Binoche and Sally Hawkins not to mention Ken Watanabe Elizabeth Olsen and David Strathairn -- fumbling around in a story that hits all the wrong beats. To boil the plot down to its essence -- a radiation-eating sub-H.R. Giger-type creature arises from the depths of the Earth and Godzilla may be its only match -- makes it sound so much more cogent than it is. The action jumps from the Philippines circa 1999 where a scientist investigating some weird formations in a cave helpfully observes ""This one looks broken like something came out of it"" to Japan around the same time where some very bizarre things are happening in the vicinity of a nuclear reactor to the present day where we might be in Hawaii San Francisco or anywhere in between at any given time. Its hard to keep track or to care.If youre a Breaking Bad fan and specifically a Bryan Cranston fan you should know that he appears in the film for approximately 20 minutes beating out Binoche by about 15. Their few brief scenes particularly Cranstons make for the best dramatic moments in the movie Cranston plays one of those dogged half-unhinged nuclear science dudes who knows something is wrong with the Earth though no one will listen to him. Its your stock crooked-glasses role but somehow Cranston makes you feel the sorrow and anxiety thrumming inside his chock-full-of-knowledge cranium. The fact that hes lost his wife in a nuclear accident -- shes played with admirable breeziness rather than nobility by Binoche -- makes his crackpot urgency easy to buy.Film Details Godzilla RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time123 More Info Trailer But who cares about any of that? Edwards and screenwriters Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham apparently dont or at least they believe the audience wont. Mostly Godzilla trots around at the heels of Aaron Taylor-Johnson a not-bad actor in a thankless role and an even more ungrateful movie who plays a Naval officer adept at defusing bombs. Because you know that might come in handy.Then again none of these humans no matter how gifted or hardworking stand a chance against the movies true star anyway. Edwards earned his stripes as a visual-effects artist and hes directed one previous feature the 2010 sci-fi thriller Monsters. To Edwards credit the G-guy when we actually get to see him isnt too shabby With his tiny id-brain head and slow-moving free-thinking tail he looks prehistoric enough to make you forget at least briefly that he was probably created on a 2000 laptop. He has a great moment when he looms glamorously and ominously from behind a row of orange-red lanterns strung up in San Franciscos Chinatown They tremble in the air their cheerful serenity disrupted by the vibration of his bad-mood footsteps and even more punishing glare. (It helps that Alexandre Desplats score bears fossil-footprint echoes of Akira Ifukubes original ""Godzilla March"" one of the grandest pieces of movie music ever written and one befitting a 350-foot legend.)There are two other great moments in Godzilla One when the scientist played by Watanabe -- a wonderful actor whos as underused here as everyone else is -- captivates a roomful of unimaginative military brass with a heartfelt story about the Japanese origins of our nuclear-radiated troublemaker capping it off with the unbeatable kicker ""We call him Gojira"" In the other Godzilla uses his super-powered radioactive heat-ray breath to fry a something-or-other whose identity the spoiler police forbid us to reveal. You could make a Vine of this moment and charge people 13.50 plus 7.50 for 3D glasses just to watch it over and over again for two hours -- or better yet show it at MOMA. Its that awesome. But its just one tiny beat in an otherwise way-too-big movie that weirdly doesnt give us enough of the one big guy we showed up to see in the first place. Instead we get massive elaborate sets -- of destroyed cities of caves of nuclear-reactor innards -- that could be anywhere but look like nowhere. Godzilla is one of those generic omnipresent blockbusters thats undone by the very spectacle it strives to dazzle us with Everything is so gargantuan so momentous that nothing has any weight. This Godzilla no matter how cool his fire breath is cant live up to the monster of our dreams. That one we still call Gojira.t Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Godzilla Running time 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense creature violence). Opens Thursday night at the Empire the Union Square others. Like more than a few senior citizens Godzillas midsection now betrays what looks like some extra trips to the all-you-can-eat buffet at the early bird special (still strictly vegetarian in his case). But the big guy demonstrates hes still got the old mojo when he finally waddles out of the Pacific after an hour of sporadic action alternating with sub-Spielbergian family drama in Gareth Edwards prestigiously cast and satisfying reboot to mark the movie monsters 60th anniversary. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson play father and son in ""Godzilla.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Rest assured Godzilla is more than up to the challenge of trying to save San Francisco from an infestation of what looked to me suspiciously like giant cockroaches on steroids. The Navy would just as soon apply the nuclear version of DDT to the problem but a Japanese scientist (Ken Watanabe) keeps urging the admiral in charge (David Straithairn) to let Godzilla ""restore balance."" It doesnt hurt that the CGI colossus not only has a tail he isnt at all reluctant to put to lethal use but breath that can literally kill. The second half of ""Godzilla is definitely more fun than the first part of a film I enjoyed overall if less than last years similar dip into giant monster blockbusterdom ""Pacific Rim."" The first hour of the new film introduces ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston in the first of a series of amusing wigs as a scientist who survives a disaster at a Japanese nuclear plant that has a predictably less fortunate outcome for his wife (Juliette Binoche). The monster of all monsters is back in ""Godzilla.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Fifteen years later even their son (a newly buffed Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Kick-Ass) a Navy explosives expert thinks the old man is nuts. That somehow doesnt dissuade Junior from joining in a trip to their now-quarantined Japanese hometown where the aforementioned cockroaches have been breeding in a top-secret international experiment. It comes as no surprise when the roaches escape nor when they turn up in Honolulu where Taylor-Johnson is on a layover on the way back to nurse-wife Elizabeth Olsen (finally cashing in during what amounts to her 14th minute of fame) and their young son in San Francisco. Taylor-Johnson is almost always in the wrong place at the wrong time including on a monorail memorably set upon by the cockroaches in an homage to Godzillas one-time wrestling opponent King Kong. (Director Edwards seems most influenced by ""Jurassic Park."") Elizabeth Olsen stars as Aaron Taylor-Johnsons wife in ""Godzilla.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Our human hero is MIA when the cockroaches level much of Las Vegas -- I say good riddance to an overused location -- but is front and center when a couple of the giant roaches engage in mating rituals among the few Frisco skyscrapers still standing prior to laying eggs in the subway system. Even in 3-D these human characters are barely one-dimensional but in the end that doesnt really matter very much. Edwards -- a Brit whose only previous directing credit was the micro-budgeted ""Monsters -- knows people dont go to these kinds of movies to watch an international cast of Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning actors. ""Godzilla"" climaxes in a welter of expertly staged monster-on-monster action that honors the memory of Ishiro Hondas 1954 classic Godzilla debut (and its numerous sequels) far more effectively than did Roland Emmerichs jokey 1998 reboot. Heres hoping that next time Warner Bros. will get the big old guy a reunion with Mothra. And I hear the other Olsen sisters are available to play the flying monsters tiny singing companions.

If youre a commuter you might want to call in before you go to work just to make sure your building is still there.Like they say you cant make a reptile omelet without breaking a few reptile eggs. Or ticking off his fans. Godzilla has remained a fascination among sci-fi lovers for more than 60 years and because of his status as perhaps the longest-tenured (and tallest) popular figure in the genre fans want to see their star get his props on the big screen. Think about Bryan Singer trying to reboot Superman. It wasnt terrible but you cant just make any Superman movie. It has to do the character justice or else the crowd turns on you.That brings us to the last time Hollywood tried doing a Godzilla film -- Roland Emmerichs 1998 version a colossal dud that had many people questioning whether Emmerich had ever seen a Godzilla film. Fortunately director Gareth Edwards and writers Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham fare much much better in the new ""Godzilla."" Theyve managed to update the story while leaving enough of the legend intact to satisfy longtime fans. Instead of being a product of the atomic age as in the original story this time our hero was apparently a target of the atomic age (or were you wondering why we blew up so many nukes in the Pacific back in the 1950s?)Advertisement Bryan Cranston is appropriately frantic as a scientist on a quest to expose what caused a nuclear meltdown (a big animal) at a power plant on the other side of the Pacific during the 1990s that killed his wife (Juliette Binoche in a role requiring about three minutes of screen time). His ensuing quest alienates him from his son (played by a buffed-up Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a Navy bomb expert who lives in San Francisco with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son.But the humans are the least of Godzillas concerns. A couple of giant slimy things are on his radar -- radiation-gobbling MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) one of which emerges from the Pacific and as giant radiation-eating monsters with heads shaped like potato chip baggie clamps are prone to do starts wreaking havoc in Japan.Meanwhile another MUTO -- which apparently was dumped years earlier in a cave near Las Vegas with other nuclear waste -- emerges stops by the casinos for a couple quick hands of blackjack then starts moving west (at one point someone mentions that the beast is about to pass through Livermore presumably for a quick bite at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory). Meanwhile we see bits and pieces of Godzilla roused and for some reason racing across the Pacific to do battle with the MUTOs who have reunited in San Francisco and are trying to raise a family despite the pesky militarys insistence on shooting at them (and what self-respecting disaster movie set on the West Coast doesnt have a school bus in peril on the Golden Gate Bridge?). As the film engages in some serious suspense-building we dont actually see the big guy until about halfway through the film. Good move. It makes him look even more menacing when he does appear. When he finally decides to show off his new and improved fire breath I nearly jumped out of my chair with a fist-pump. While the monsters are computer-generated the destroyed landscapes come via old-school model-making. The combination makes for fantastic visuals especially in 3-D. The experience is made even more threatening with an exceptional musical score by Alexandre Desplat (""Argo""). Lost in all the action is the question of whether Godzilla is a good guy and if so why. And whats his motive? But really who cares? As the Japanese scientist played by Ken Watanabe says we shouldnt mess with nature. Just let the big brutes fight it out. And fight it out it they do. This is the ""Godzilla"" fans have been waiting for and any other big budget summer action flick will be hard-pressed to equal the fun. This film image released by Warner Bros.

Pictures Kimberley French) Share PhotoNo one can blame Gareth Edwards for admittedly feeling nervous when asked to helm a remake of the biggest monster movie of all time. Sure the only other film he had directed happened to be 2010s ""Monsters."" But this time it was Godzilla.Well the latest iteration of the 60-year-old franchise is in capable hands. Edwards ""Godzilla"" is a pleasingly paced 3-D spectacle that pays chilling homage to the artful legacy of the original 1954 film -- Ishiro Hondas ""Gojira"" -- while emerging as its own prodigious monster movie.Created as a symbol of the nuclear threat following Americas atomic attacks on Japan in World War II Godzillas reappearance suggests the nuclear tests conducted by the U.S. in the Pacific after the war were really meant to hold the radioactive dinosaur back.This story begins in Japan in 1999 as nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston edgy in an unbearable wig) investigates questionable seismic activity at the Janjira nuclear power plant.When a team at the plant including his scientist wife Sandra (an underused Juliette Binoche) dies in what everyone believes is a natural disaster Joe dedicates his life to proving that what caused the devastation was anything but natural. His obsession creates a rift between himself and his son Ford.Fifteen years later we catch up with Ford (played by a placid but sexy Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in San Francisco where he lives with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and their son.Serving in the U.S. Navy Ford disarms bombs a skill that later helps him save the planet from MUTOs -- ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" -- that emerge from a long dormancy and begin traveling the globe feeding on radiation.Screenwriter Max Borenstein working from a story by Dave Callaham doesnt bombard us with multiple narratives or a multitude of characters (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins play scientists and David Strathairn plays an admiral).Instead the film focuses on Fords family story which Borenstein takes his time developing. When we finally see Godzilla -- just shy of an hour into the film -- the anticipation has built to such a degree that we expect to be awe-struck. And we are.The tallest of any Godzillas before him this one stands 355 feet high -- about 30 stories -- with glistening scaly skin and dorsal fin spikes down his back. His terrifying yet textured roar shakes the theater.Aiming for a realistic take on how we might react to an invasion by giant creatures Edwards makes sure our view of them rarely shifts from the human perspective.Honoring the eerie music of the original this films score by Alexandre Desplat (""Argo"") is equally menacing rich with horns that complement the consistently serious tone of the movie.In the original film made using stop-motion photography an actor stomped around a miniature Tokyo in a latex suit. But in the hands of visual effects guru Jim Rygiel (""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise) the contemporary take looks incredibly fluid and Godzillas movements appear far more natural.But were not bombarded with excessive CGI here. Godzilla isnt oversold although for some his lack of screentime wont be satisfying enough. However the balance between the family-focused story line and intense action sequences is bound to please others.A threat to the planet in the 50s version Godzilla isnt out to take the world down this time. Hes here to be its hero and his massive showdown -- fiery radioactive breath and all -- against the MUTOs is the highlight. Hes more than a catastrophic beast and were on his side when he swims off into the sunset.While the predictable sequel has not yet been confirmed one thing is clear Edwards version of ""Godzilla"" remains the ultimate monster movie. The legacy has been upheld.""Godzilla"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense sequences of destruction mayhem and creature violence. Running time 123 minutes. Three stars out of four.MPAA rating definition for PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 12 2014 at 858 PM updated May 14 2014 at 1243 PM comments Watch out Japan. (Also Oakland San Francisco Las Vegas and various other U.S. cities). Its that big green guy again. And as usual his breath is awful and hes pretty careless about where he swings that tail. Welcome back Godzilla. Of course in some ways its as if he never went away. Last years ""Pacific Rim"" had its share of giant monsters (Kaiju theyre called in Japan.) The shaky-cam ""Cloverfield"" mined similar material in 2008 as did the creatively low-budget ""Monsters"" in 2010. And Ive been at this long enough that I reviewed the original ""Godzilla"" reboot in 1998 -- as well as the Japanese ""Godzilla 2000"" and the 50th-anniversary re-release of the original in 2004. Still as influential and imitated as hes become the G-mans still a pleasant popcorn thrill particularly when in classic (albeit updated) fashion he starts stepping on skyscrapers and roaring that window-rattling cry. The new film is directed by Gareth Edwards who helmed the mini-budgeted ""Monsters"" and is at heart a special-effects guy. And to be fair that shows. Although the script hes been given isnt very good he doesnt do very much with it either. It sounds like an old Method-actor joke - ""Whats the monsters motivation?"" -- but a lot of the movie just seems to happen arbitrarily. (The smartest stars get killed off early -- Im guessing it was in their contracts.) In fact although there are some hints at an origin story -- unfolding mostly under the stylish credits -- this almost feels like a sequel. Giant insect-like creatures dubbed MUTOs -- for ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism(s)"" -- are sucking on our nuclear power plants and destroying our cities. Luckily Godzilla then rises from the depths to stomp on the creatures and announces one scientist ""Restore balance."" Why? The unlikely answer -- offered here -- is that hes an ""alpha predator."" The most plausible one? That its the franchises kiddie-matinee multi-monster sequels the studios really trying to replicate. And that ""Godzilla"" delivers. To his credit Edwards brings on some new creatures -- the two MUTOs look like crosses between the ""Alien"" monster and a cricket. The director also although his budget has increased exponentially mostly sticks to his smart battleplan from ""Monsters"" -- hint dont show. For the longest part of the movie we see Godzilla only in glimpses -- his tail the ridges on his back one massive foot. The most exciting moments come in the background -- as something starts to move in the distance a claw begins to scuttle over a bridge. While Edwards paying attention to the monsters though the humans get short shrift. About the best thing you can say about our globe-trotting hero Aaron Taylor-Johnson -- who has all the charisma of a Stratego piece -- is that hes not Taylor Kitsch. The usually excellent Elizabeth Olsen mostly widens her already huge eyes and looks concerned. None of it seems to matter much -- nobody we care about is at risk here -- which the filmmakers clearly understand and overcompensate for putting not only three little kids in jeopardy but a cute dog too. But if you dont care about actors or even characters if you dont question why a monster would want to save the Earth if you really dont ask for anything more than a solid hour or so of giant creatures beating on each other well then this new ""Godzilla"" is for you -- just the way all the old ones were. But this time without some poor actor in a rubber suit. Godzilla (PG-13) Warner Bros. (123 min.) Directed by Gareth Edwards. With Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen.

Someone should tell Warner Bros. that when theyve got a presence as big as Godzilla they dont need movie stars because frankly who remembers the characters in a rampaging-kaiju movie anyway? Still just to be safe the studio has stuffed Gareth Edwards deafening effects-driven reboot with an Oscar winner (Juliette Binoche) three Oscar nominees (Ken Watanabe Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn) an Emmy winner (Bryan Cranston) and an Olsen sister leaving scarcely enough screen time for the monster itself. Worldwide B.O. will be massive when ""Godzilla"" stomps into theaters beginning May 14 bound to crush the 379 million earned by Sonys underwhelming 1998 version. As risky decisions go entrusting microbudget ""Monsters"" director Edwards to helm a 160 million tentpole -- Warners first Godzilla pic since acquiring the character rights from Toho in 2010 -- looks downright sensible in retrospect as the filmmaker makes good on his ability to conjure enormous scope and scale via clever staging and visual effects. If anything it was ""Monsters"" stilted live-action bits that left something to be desired which might explain why Edwards has overcompensated so drastically when it comes to the human performances this time around. It takes nearly an hour for Godzilla to make his entrance in a film that begins with lots of hyper-secretive government types debating seismic activity that can only point to one thing enormous prehistoric creatures awakened from their millennia-long slumber. Where traditional Godzilla lore presented the monster as a warning against nuclear proliferation after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki this revisionist version suggests ""all those nuclear tests"" the U.S. conducted in the Pacific between 1946 and 1962 werent tests but an effort to contain a giant amphibious dinosaur. This time its Filipino mining that stirs a giant MUTO -- or ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism."" In a ""Jurassic Park""-like prologue two scientists (Watanabe and Hawkins) helicopter into a huge computer-generated quarry where they discover two perfectly preserved chrysalis-shaped pods attached to an enormous skeleton. One of the sacs has ruptured with whatever escaped digging a messy trail to the sea. The other is taken back to the States for further study conveniently close to Las Vegas. Meanwhile in Tokyo Joe Brody (Cranston hyperventilating in a crazy-person wig) and his wife Sandra (Binoche) live a short drive from the computer-generated nuclear facility where they both work. Whatever busted loose in the Philippines craves radioactive energy a compulsion at least as strong as the one driving screenwriter Max Borenstein to work character development into a franchise where humans have traditionally been glorified ants. Tragedy strikes nuclear reactors implode and the couples son Ford is left partly parentless and oddly ultra-disciplined. The story picks up again 15 years later with Ford (""Kick-Ass"" star Aaron Taylor-Johnson no longer a skinny John Lennon lookalike) serving as an explosive ordnance disposal jockey for the U.S. Navy -- a job that makes him uniquely qualified to defuse the ticking atomic device that threatens to blow San Francisco off the map in the third act. Speaking of bombs Edwards and his team seem desperate to distance their ""Godzilla"" from 1998s Roland Emmerich-directed disappointment which treated attack by giant Gila monster as yet another disaster-movie premise. Instead Edwards cribs from the Spielberg playbook where its not the big-picture threat of nuclear power but the more intimate threats to the nuclear family at stake while anticipation for a long-delayed group hug fuels the narrative. This latest ""Godzilla"" shifts the theater of operations from Manhattan to the Pacific Ocean where monsters are free to pillage the coasts of Japan and California alike but repeats Emmerichs most common mistake by focusing on a relatively banal group of characters. Yes it would help to get a ""Godzilla"" with interesting humans for a change but failing that theres no shame in putting the reptile front and center. Edwards seems to have miscalculated our investment in his cast (including Elizabeth Olsen uncharacteristically bland as Fords wife) simultaneously underestimating how satisfying some good old-fashioned monster-on-MUTO action can be. The hero of any Godzilla movie is -- or should always be -- Godzilla and this one presents the mighty dino as a sort of scaly Shane When big radioactive bullies start throwing their weight around he lumbers out of the deep to defend the helpless then rides off into the distance every bit as mysterious after the deed is done. At first the humans are terrified by the lizards appearance but soon enough they come around embracing the philosophy that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" or as Watanabe puts it ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around. Let them fight"" That would be splendid advice for the filmmakers to heed as well since we often get the sense that while the movie is distracted by what the people are doing a terrific battle is raging somewhere else in the city -- the mere sound of which (in its bass-blasting ""Dark Knight""-indebted way) threatens to bring the theater crumbling down around us. No previous Godzilla movie has worried much about the issue of plausibility (the most obvious exception being the unofficial kaiju epic ""Cloverfield"" which went the found-footage route in trying to pass things off as ""real"") but it seems to be an almost crippling concern here. The creative team spends entirely too much time attempting to treat the threat as authentic resorting to myriad tricks even when audiences would be more than willing to suspend their disbelief Nearly all the significant monster scenes happen at night; much of the creature footage is shown either directly from a human p.o.v. (like the shot seen through Fords facemask as he skydives past Godzilla) or over their shoulders from ground level (as when closing bomb-shelter doors obscure a particularly juicy bout); and TV monitors in most locations broadcast eyewitness footage of cities under siege. Godzilla movies like wrestling matches are ultimately judged by the quality of the mayhem and Edwards excels at blowing things up. Though some of the first visual effects we see onscreen (the Filipino mine the Japanese nuclear plant) look phony especially projected in post-converted 3D the creature effects are terrific using phosphorescent accents -- glowing gold for the MUTOs blue fire for Godzilla -- to make the monsters look even more menacing after dark. And though the film banishes most of their fighting to the background the visual effects crew at MPC made an inspired choice in using motion-capture humans as a reference for Godzillas hand-animated performance thereby updating the lo-fi B-movie tradition in which audiences charitably forgot that they were cheering for a guy in a rubber suit stomping through a cardboard city.

Dogg says June 2 2014 at 559 am i was somewhat entertained by this Production; its a Monster Movie. Feature the MONSTERS Saw so little time of Godzilla in this 2hr+ Production and Godzilla wasnt as clever with attitude or savagely brilliant amp; brutal in his attacks till the very last scene of fighting. And what a very SSSSSSSSSLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW build-up to FINALLY using his atomic-like fire-breath I wanted to see GODZILLA far more than the military amp; CNN but it was appreciated for the multimedia fiasco. I do have to ask though Didnt somebody - ANYBODY - notice the HUGE GAPING HOLES the newborn MUTUs made in the side of a MOUNTAIN both in Japan or Las Vegas-???? ..Anyone..? Anyone...? Beuller? Reply therealeverton says June 2 2014 at 858 am A Monster Movie really does NOT have to feature the monsters for the majority of the time. Their effects their presence unseen and peoples reactions to them are what you get in the classics and the ""first"" instalments. Even in Jaws where the final section is 100% them hunting the shark you see it scarcely. King Kong doesnt appear for some time in either the original or P Jackson versions. Similar in Alien and many others The Thing from Another World etc.. The film is inn good company when trying to be the ""anti-Transformers"". Build up the tension build up the action and tease the monster through the devastation. A little restraint is welcome these days but sure not everyone will like that; but it is classic Monster movie making. Reply therealeverton says June 2 2014 at 851 am Id have to see it again but the impression I had at the time was that there was nobody to notice the holes. They had very recently happened a matter of hours at most and it wasnt as if they were in the centre of town. When I see it again I may find that I had that wrong but it did seem that way at the time. Reply mikemoviereviewer says May 20 2014 at 836 pm Id never seen a good movie with the word ""Godzilla"" in the title. Now I have seen a good one. Reply Cliff Johnson says May 19 2014 at 715 am You have a critics eye to be sure. But as a historian you might want to look at the original Godzilla Rodan and the subsequent ""versus"" film. In both intro films the characters were important as representative of human psyches when presented with repercussions of our hubris. In the current film the human element is presented to ensure appreciation of Godzilla as a ""savior"". Reinforcining the Japanese mythology since the 1970s. If there was a serious fault it would have been time constraints for character development; which is a flaw in most giant creature movies. Reply Steve Martin says May 17 2014 at 644 pm The first part of the film was surprisingly compelling with a tinge of mystery. After the first monster appeared it turned into a lousy cartoon with a few good technical effects. Thats not enough to make it interesting. I certainly would not recommend this movie to anyone who has seen ""Gojira."" Reply Bobby K says May 18 2014 at 417 pm Number One Godzillas head was way too small. 2. Although a big fan of Cranston that whole part was unnecessary and didnt help the movie. 3. The little Japanese kid? 4. Not enough Godzilla. 5. The other monsters were so-so. 6. The Cool stuff Godzilla bashing the bad monsters. All the military stuff. Overall I give it a B- only because I appreciate the concept effort and scale. Reply lavafire1 says May 17 2014 at 456 pm I thought it was a really good movie the only problem that I thought there was. Is that Godzilla was a bit to big I guess they were trying to go with the original idea of Godzilla looking part Gorilla and part whale so I wasnt at all disappointed by the movie Reply Relentless Vidtrekker says May 17 2014 at 1002 am A real waste of time. The film was murky dark as was the storyline. The dialog was largely unintelligible and devoid of any real emotion (save Cranston). The acting from most of the principles was wooden and cliche ridden. With all the CGI expended on the film it was no more exciting than the rubber suit predecessors. The only thing the film makers got right was the trailer that successfully piqued more interest than this film deserved. No sequels please Reply Jay says May 17 2014 at 1230 am Look this movie too me was okay. But as far as to call it Godzilla I dont think so. I grew up at 4 years old watching Godzilla you first made the picture to dark second the blue flame sound should have been similar to old Godzilla third I think it should be called hogzilla like the Japanese are saying. I mean really all you had to do is thin his neck and ass. Lets say really 45 min till you actually see him the creatures he faught look stupid an when Godzilla went down what happen its so dam dark I cant tell. Big fan of Godzilla saw everyone this in my book is not Godzilla maybe a Zola of something. Reply Steve C. says May 17 2014 at 1216 am Dear God what an absolutely awful movie. Reply BDC2 says May 16 2014 at 1003 pm Not enough character development in a Monster movie? Who woulda thunk? It was a great update to a classic. See a romatic comedy for lovable in-depth character potrayals......and lots of yawns and courtesy laughs. See Godzilla for fun monsters and mayhem. Reply ric says May 16 2014 at 609 pm One of the worst movie I have ever seen. It was an ordeal watching it though its 2-hour run. The drama and the action did not meld well. It was corny. Reply Dale says May 15 2014 at 1120 pm I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I will admit when the humans were front and center I was desperately wishing for less people and more Godzilla. Reply Dogg says June 2 2014 at 602 am I SO AGREE Reply Paul says May 15 2014 at 727 am This reviewer should never write again. What an a-hole. People read reviews to know if the should watch the movie. Not for a complete freaking synopsis. The movie was ruined for anyone who read this. Just atrocious. Reply Carl says May 15 2014 at 928 am I totally agree with youman Reply harry georgatos says May 14 2014 at 904 pm This was better then I thought it will be. Far better then the Emmerich atrocity. Basically the director Gareth Edwards is reworking his non-budget cult-classic MONSTERS. At times it feels like Im once again sitting in the cinema watching MONSTERS. At the end of the day this is a really good Godzilla movie and the director really understands these movies better then what Emmerich gave us. This director really knows how to create atmosphere and an end of the world scenario on the brink of collapse. Reply RAClements says May 14 2014 at 516 am For the record Im not intending to see this movie on the big screen Im happy to wait for the DVD. But this is an appaling review. Just saying this happens and then this happens and then this happens is not a review. It is a lazy way to get to your word count as well as spoilering the movie for people who care. Reply shakenbake192 says May 13 2014 at 1011 pm Do you really think its necessary or funny to put computer generated in front of whatever noun you are describing? You act like you are upset they used CG instead of actually demolishing a nuclear facility or that Godzilla isnt truly real. This is probably the first review Ive read where someone acted like they genuinely did not like the film. Based on your critiques you sound way too uptight to enjoy a movie like this regardless of who was directing it. Some people just cant go to the movies anymore and enjoy themselves. Reply William Gazecki says May 13 2014 at 348 pm What a terrible review Totally spoiled any anticipation... the entire review is a reiteration of the plot Thats not what reviews are for. Tell me about the filmmaking; dont just fill up space recounting the story. Whereas the trailer was magnificent in the opposite. It revealed nothing and made me want to see the pic. Reply cxg says May 13 2014 at 927 am Despite this lame review I cant wait to see this film. BUT I will be mildly disappointed if Godzilla looks exactly like the T-Rex from Jurassic Park. The original rubber suit Godzilla always looked just a little cuddly-ish which made him even more the hero. Reply therealeverton says May 13 2014 at 957 am I know what you mean but the Original Godzilla wasnt cuddly he was as scary as was possible for the period especially with thee Black amp; White. He wasnt the hero until the 5th film and even then he actually refused to help save the world as he didnt like people until Mothras courage in fighting a much more powerful monster alone shames him into joining in. Thee 2nd and 3rd series of Godzilla films made Godzilla look much fiercer than the first set I think this film falls somewhere in between but they were definitely careful to avoid a rounded head as that does tend to make animals seem ""cuter"". Reply Joe says May 13 2014 at 719 am This was hardly a review. Debruge fails to state any indication of the quality of the movie or his level of enjoyment from it. I rate this review 3/10. Reply Jason M says May 13 2014 at 616 am I believe monster movies should be more than a dumb action fest. Personally I am happy this Godzilla is not some brainless monster mash. Reply Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says May 13 2014 at 508 am Reblogged this on HORROR BOOM and commented You know this is only the second mixed review Ive seen (Dread Central loved it-said it wasnt perfect but any flaws could be forgiven just for the geek-gasm fans will get seeing this Godzilla actually breathe fire) Reply Jackie says May 12 2014 at 329 pm Adjusted for inflation the 1998 movie made more like 600. That was before widespread IMAX usage and no 3D premium. Its not quite the failure you make it out to be. You also dont seem to know what you really want to say. You praise and attack the cgi mayhem. One gets the feeling you were never going to ""get"" this movie. Reply Asok Smith says May 12 2014 at 1209 pm Im pretty much done with CGIed movies. The last couple have been so awful weve walked out before they were half over. Almost non-existent story pathetic dialog and lame acting. How about some more movies like ""Silver Linings Playbook""? Cost 21000000 to make and grossed 132000000 at the box office. Reply Jackie Jormpjomp says May 12 2014 at 612 pm Nothing against Silver Linings Playbook but if every or even most movies were similar to that flick the world would really suck. Reply therealeverton says May 12 2014 at 125 pm Because people want ALL kinds of films. They arent cancelling Silver linings type films to make this???? Reply chvad says May 12 2014 at 1217 pm How about that doesnt have Godzilla? How about you post something remotely close to relevant. Reply rocky-o says May 12 2014 at 1110 am rotten tomatoes considered this a good review?...man id hate to see a bad review...this is why i dont pay attention to rotten tomatoes...just a bunch of hacks listening to other hacks hacking up idiotic thoughts so that crap like man of steel can try and make it plausible to have a sequel...and for the person who said this film (godzilla) was gonna bomb define bomb...according to reviews it looks like ""spider man 2"" is a bomb yet it will still bring in a gazillion dollars which the studio (and most of the world) will view as a success...very few care about art anymore...if youre looking for a movie that isnt a bomb then stay away from the multiplex theatres and check out a little art cinema...there your spirit can feel hope again... Reply Robert Kreiling says May 12 2014 at 1124 am ""Man of Steel"" got a 56% on the Tomatometer which makes it ""rotten"" and therefore bad by RottenTomatoes standards. How is that supposed to help it get a sequel? Reply Godzilla says May 12 2014 at 913 am the same critics love all the cheesy super hero movies weve been bombarded with lately because they are so plausible. In real life can beat Scarlette Johanson to death in about 5 seconds. Reply Chvad SB says May 11 2014 at 1124 pm "" because frankly who remembers the characters in a rampaging-kaiju movie anyway?"" I stopped reading the review here. Raymond Burr much? Not to mention a number of notable Asian actors over the years. But you wouldnt be bothered to remember them either Im sure. If the rest of the review was half as poorly stated as the first sentence Im sure Im not missing much. Reply therealeverton says May 12 2014 at 1207 am Mate that is possibly the least asinine thing in the review it genuinely does get worse even more ignorant if you can believe that. Reply therealeverton says May 13 2014 at 641 am Mrs. Horror Boom Critics that complain about loud noise in films like this should be barred. Its loud and...? Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says May 13 2014 at 545 am I agree completely Also he complains twice about the deafening soundtrack. How is THAT relevant to the movies quality and entertainment value? Dude if it bothers you that much bring a set of earplugs with you to screenings and quit bitching. Also when it comes to insulting Bryan Cranstons acting my advice would be to tread lightly. The whole review just drips with disdain and ignorance along with a snotty tone. Also he says ""Speaking of bombs Edwards and his team seem desperate to distance their ""Godzilla"" from 1998s Roland Emmerich-directed disappointment"" like thats a bad thing. I mean I guess his perceived desperation sounds bad but really? The movie tries to go a different route from that horrible shiteshow? Fine with me. Im still psyched up and have read reviews written by fans of monster movies who admit its not perfect but still had a blast. Jeff says May 11 2014 at 412 pm This movie is going to Bomb. Big time. Reply Shaheed says May 13 2014 at 933 am Saw the movie last night. It will not bomb. It was actually a good movie. My daughter enjoyed and shes not a Godzilla fan. She wants to see it again. Reply therealeverton says May 12 2014 at 1213 am You seriously think a Godzilla film with the extra boost of Pacific Rim putting ""Kaiju"" films back into global minds (or there for the first time) wont get 450m or more? Even with X-Men and Maleficent opening 1 amp; 2 weeks after this theres no way this film will miss that mark. The awful film from made the equivalent of 600m+ Even with stiffer competition this will at least hit the break even point of 450m especially with IMAX amp; 3D. X-Men will hurt it for sure but it won""t bomband definitely not hard. Reply JoeE says May 11 2014 at 924 am Yeah this was pretty bad. Not as bad as the Matthew Broderick version. Nothing is as bad as that. But this was just a complete waste of time. Dont understand why they dont remake Monster Zero and have Godzilla fight off an alien invasion or King Ghidera or something. Like the reviewer said Godzilla should be the hero. Reply therealeverton says May 11 2014 at 1050 am Well after Sonys 1998 film Toho announced that th monster in that film was NOT eve Godzilla; they renamed it Zilla. Here the head of Toho said this was the Godzilla of his childhood. So it seems they got this right. Why should Godzilla be the hero? Hes been a force of nature (neither enemy nor friend and the actual enemy in more films than hes been the hero. As this is meant to be the ""first"" film then its ""lucky"" he isnt the direct enemy as he was in the Toho restarts and the first 3 of the first 4 films. Even in many of the films where he ""saved"" us he was a reluctant anti-hero deciding the new Kaiju where more of a threat to him than we were; or basically just going home after winning a fight rather than trampling another city. Reply Daniel Garrett Irwin says May 11 2014 at 823 am I dont care what the critics think. The new Godzilla will kick ass fair and square. Pacific Rim better take notes Reply valhallaarwen says May 11 2014 at 734 am I plan on seeing this movie regardless of what this or anyone else have to say. I have wanted to see a real Godzilla movie since the real ones from Japan (I dont count the ones in the 90s) they suck. But I know this director doesnt like Godzilla because he seems to be upset that the action does not take place in New York. Anyone who knows anything about Godzilla would know that 99% of the older movies take place in Japan which near the pacific ocean so wouldnt it make sense for the new movies to take place near the pacific if Godzilla was going to come to America? And as for the star of the movie duh its Godzilla. I dont need stars I need Godzilla and what he will do. Reply marinh says May 11 2014 at 716 am Why not use A-list talent? What are we saving them for? Moms Night Out? Reply therealeverton says May 11 2014 at 759 am What they have used is quality talent which is sometimes preferable. But more to the point the film has cost 160m and by using quality award level talent they get enough recognisable faces and respected around the globe without having to take money away from the films real star Godzilla and the effects that it will take to make a film like this look good. This way you get a decent but not irresponsible budget Reply rocky-o says May 11 2014 at 440 am the problem with most films and film audiences nowadays is their expectation for stuff to happen immediately...older films explored the human aspect of stories before getting into the supposed action of the piece...(for a reference...check out ""the poseidon adventure"" versus its latter-day counterpart ""poseidon"")...most (and i stress most not all) people dont have the patience nowadays to actually listen to dialogue...they dont care who dies just as long as someone dies or something gets blown-up destroyed cgi-fied mayhem with very little storyline...(for that reference check out ""man of steel""...no wait...please dont bother...i wouldnt want you to have to put yourself through that...)...but you get the point... Reply therealeverton says May 11 2014 at 531 am Part of the problem here is that you get reviewers falsely it seems moaning about the lack of characters and too many explosions and effects instead or adhering to formula. Then whenever a ""big"" film does do this you get complaints. (And yes ironically by keeping the big guy largely OFF the screen for so long it is keeping to the conventions of 1st monster films like Gojira Godzilla 1984 Jaws King Kong Jurassic Park and so on) Reply Godzilla says May 12 2014 at 922 am Look at all the awful Transformer movies that blow their wad five minutes in then have no where to go and were stuck with 2 hours of blurry special effects Micheal Bay style. Everton Carter says May 10 2014 at 1145 pm Your ignorance of what makes a Godzilla film let alone a rampaging Kaiju film is astounding. The star monster not appearing for long time is pretty standard especially in the first film. Human characters however much you may or may not remember them are very important. Oh and I know you kind of qualify your comment with the word ""traditional"" but Godzilla films have been about more than just nukes and nuclear energy; with several films being primarily about damaging the environment with pollution mankind thinking it was special and hence all powerful genetic enginering and even warning against the hubris of Japan itself after their post WWII economic boom saw many thinking they would take over the world with money having failed to do so in the war. Godzilla literally smashing the prosperity his character had helped to achieve and the character most responsible for it in the film. You dont have to be a Godzilla expert or a kaiju expert to review this film but you better be if youre going to try to beat the film over the head for not being what you think it should be. By what youve said here the film makers (hooray) have a far better understanding of the character and genre than you do. Reply ZEUS says May 10 2014 at 1103 pm THE WRATH OF GODZILLA FANS KNOWS NO BOUNDS......RELEASE THE FANS Reply therealeverton says May 10 2014 at 1150 pm Maybe but from what Ive heard and what this reviewer says the fans who know Godzilla films will be just fine. Anyone who thinks not fully seeing Godzilla for almost an hour or having a message other than nukes are bad is unusual/unheard of for these films does not have a clhue about Godzilla films. (Clearly forgets how long after the start it is before we see a T-rex in Jurassic Park or King Kong in any version of that film either. Reply Joey Hegele says May 10 2014 at 1101 pm Was this a positive review or not? Even though I read whole thing I honestly cannot be certain whether Debruge liked the movie or not. I guess I will just wait to see whether RottenTomatoes classifies is as fresh or rotten. Reply Joey Hegele says May 12 2014 at 1049 am Well as a follow-up RottenTomatoes says it is a positive review. http//www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla_2014/ I am not sure I would call this a positive review particularly not with sentences like this ""If anything it was ""Monsters"" stilted live-action bits that left something to be desired which might explain why Edwards has overcompensated so drastically when it comes to the human performances this time around."" When I was a little kid I loved two things Godzilla and Transformers. As long as this film is better than those awful Michael Bay movies I will be happy. Reply schmeg says May 11 2014 at 445 am Rotten Tomatoes? The McReviewer of our time. Reading for comprehension is taught in the 2nd grade and its reasonably clear where this review stands. Read it again - with a pen and paper if you must. Reply therealeverton says May 11 2014 at 1100 am RT is used poorly and too many critics see it as a way to make a name for themselves. The reviewers choose themselves if a film is fresh or Rotten; so you get nonsensical situations where two films have 3 stars or 6 out of 10 yet one is fresh and one is rotten. The real problem is the Fresh / Rotten amp;/or percentage of reviewers who voted fresh is what gets used. The more important part is surely how good they thought it was. Surely youre more impressed wen 7 of your friends tell you a film is excellent than when 10 tell you its O.K? Ken says May 11 2014 at 1035 am And this is one of the many problems w/ Rotten Tomatoes how does one ""rate"" an ambiguous review like Debruges? Is it a ""Fresh""? A ""Rotten""? What is RTs criteria for deciding how a flick gets slotted? The once-noble craft of movie reviewing reduced to a peculiar algorithmic aggregate featuring the opinions of dozens of mysterious online ""critics"" no one has ever heard of - and we as ticket buyers are supposed to pay attention to this messy load of data? After re-reading this GODZILLA review 3 times I THINK I get Debruges take on it...and Im STILL gonna go see it. therealeverton says May 11 2014 at 516 am No hes right. The review makes a lot of criticisms mostly baseless and founded on what ws a very poor idea of how these films have worked in the past (T?he reviewer has clearly seen none ever; or what should be done in monster films despite the evidence to the contrary of almost every monster film of note; and a quite staggeringly rude an ill informed piece of nonsense about how they have never tried ot make these films look as real as they possibly could in the past a nonsense for several of the films and pretty much all of the ""serious"" ones where they spent a lot of time making these things look as real and as ""plausible"" as possible. And yes with more than just man in rubber suit tech too.) They are making a 160m Hollywood film in 2014 what should it be Stop motion by Aardman? (That isnt me knocking the gods at Aardman by the way) George Valentin says May 10 2014 at 1059 pm I hope ""Godzilla"" will become the highest grossing movie of all time. Reply BillUSA says May 10 2014 at 1052 pm If I wanted to see Shakespeare Id see something else. But a film like this wont spend time on character development. I liked ""Monsters"" and thought Gareth Edwards was a fine choice to helm this film. I didnt like the goofy storyline of the Broderick-starrer but the creature-on-a-rampage is just supposed to be eye-candy anyway. I cant wait to see this one even if 10 is too much to waste on the best that Hollywood can offer these days.

Posted June 5 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Let me put my cards on the table. I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching Creature Double Feature smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah. There was something about seeing these behemoths stomp Tokyo to dust that made me absolutely giddy the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by A-bomb radiation the model-shop ingenuity the laughable man-in-a-rubber-suit campiness. Its been 16 years since Hollywood nearly soured that love affair thanks to Roland Emmerichs 1998 atrocity. And I was hopeful that the splashy new 3-D reboot might rekindle the old flame. Unfortunately Gareth Edwards Godzilla feels like two movies Scotch-taped together. In one Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past whos racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies Aaron Taylor-Johnson is his estranged soldier son and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition-spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankinds hubris. In the other mammoth CG beasts knock the snot out of one another. Only one of these movies is any good. Thankfully its the monster one. Edwards whose only previous film was 2010s low-budget Monsters has been given a quick call-up to the majors with the reported 160 million Godzilla. He doesnt seem too interested in his actors -- theyre more plodding than their reptilian costars and you dont care about a single one of them -- but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem. Taking a cue from Jaws he wisely delays Godzillas appearance building suspense. In movies like these its all about the slow tease and the big reveal. As an appetizer though he gives us a pair of ""MUTOs"" (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms) -- a male and female duo of giant Giger-esque creatures with sleek pincer jaws that resemble humongous staple removers. The MUTOs who arrive on the scene after leveling a Japanese nuclear reactor care about two things feeding on the radiation that created them and mating with each other in...San Francisco of all places. Tony Bennett would be proud. When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ""restore balance"" he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new. As big as a Sheraton and with a shriek that rumbles your insides he appears beefier and meaner than you remember. But looks can be deceiving. Godzilla is humanitys only hope for destroying the MUTOs. Or as Watanabes Dr. Serizawa says ""Let them fight"" And fight they do in an epic clash that turns the Bay Area to rubble. Unlike last year?s disappointing Pacific Rim Godzilla actually shows us its monsters without a scrim of rain and a cloak of darkness. And the thrill of the film is getting the chance to fetishize their sheer size and physicality as they rip through power lines and demolish buildings with their lashing tails. In its handful of moments like these Godzilla almost makes you feel like a kid again.

Now everyones favourite mean green city-stomping machine gets the big-budget 3D treatment courtesy of Brit director Gareth Edwards whose 2010 DIY indie Monsters impressed many. If all you need for a good time is full-on shots of wondrously realised CGI creatures turning to the camera and giving an almighty spit-flecked roar youre in luck. But those hoping this Godzilla might have brains as well as bulk could be disappointed. It starts strongly with eerie stock footage of Pacific nuclear tests followed by a nailbiting opening sequence at a Fukushima-style power plant bluntly but effectively echoing the original 1954 films post-Hiroshima atomic angst. Flash forward 14 years and we find chief engineer Joe (Bryan Cranston) obsessed with theories about the accident while his estranged son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) tries to bring his dad back down to earth. Then something stirs in the deep... Edwards is an absolute whiz when it comes to creature design. Godzilla himself is chunky tactile and pleasingly old fashioned particularly in comparison with Roland Emmerichs ornate spiky 1998 reboot while his adversaries the winged insectoid Muto (aka Mothra) are delightfully grotesque. But his handling of storytelling is not so confident following a couple of gripping action scenes (and one distracting plotting blunder early on) Godzilla settles into a simple fairly standard cross-Pacific chase movie. The script is derivative and lacks humour and the characterisation is weak actors like Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe have little to do while a bland Taylor-Johnson is miscast as the square-jawed hero. Its fun to watch scaly skyscraper-sized behemoths lay waste to civilisation but a bit more human drama would be welcome.

Its everyones old pal Godzilla -- welcome back buddy First on-screen in 1954s film of the same name the title terror is back in a 150-million production directed by Gareth Edwards that tries to rescue everyones favorite giant lizard from decades of brand dilution camp references and 1998s disastrous Hollywood revision. The best thing about this new ""Godzilla"" is that it spares no expense or effort to deliver big burly IMAX-ified action. Godzilla and diverse other radioactive giant creatures feud flail at and fight each other and lay waste to huge cities as part of their combat here and its all amazingly shot. The worst thing about this new Godzilla is how thats the best thing about it. Dont misunderstand me for thrills and spills and rock-em sock-em monster-fighting action this is a must-see. Director Edwards (of ""Monsters"") and his technical crew combine motion-capture 3D and megaformat filmmaking to convey the clash and struggle of fascinating beasts and the net result is embarrassingly enjoyable urban destruction and action. This iteration has technical prowess and computing power that the early franchise efforts by Toho Studios could only dream of with their stomp-able miniatures and-man-in-suit effects; but by upping the effects without paying attention to the affect ""Godzilla"" gains majesty and loses meaning. The 1954 ""Godzilla"" no matter its flaws was a terrifying allegory of nuclear fear gone mad unimaginable destruction unleashed by scientific ""progress"" and the arrogance that the primal forces of the universe were ours to control. You can laugh at the original all you want but it was a powerful exciting metaphor for a not-so-brave new world of anxieties and terrors unleashed by the decision to use the A-bomb at Hiroshima; this new film feels like a powerful exciting metaphor for how much we like monster movies. Theres destruction in it but no darkness; power but no purpose; bulk but no gravity. The film has as they say no spurs to prick the sides of its intent besides its ambition. But what sides The new-school Godzilla is a majestic massive beast with bulk and power in every step; using motion-capture and good judgment Edwards and his effects team make a film thats quantum leaps above and beyond the silly Power-Rangers-on-steroids shallowness of the hard-to-endure ""Pacific Rim."" But the plots turns and happenings are more narrated and intoned (by Ken Watanabe) than they are actually explained or proven; it often feels like the film is operating from a cheat sheet finding all the right answers while failing to show us the actual work it takes to arrive at those answers. The human actors are good-to-adequate. Bryan Cranston gives good mad scientist; Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are present to give a human sense of scale and progress to the proceedings. But when the camera has to switch from emotive close-ups to gods-eye-view panoramas of grappling leviathans somethings going to get lost in transition and the actors suffer for it. Screenwriter Max Borenstein (""Seventh Son"") has given us a movie informed by the hypnotic rhythms and easy rules of modern big-budget screenwriting not the nightmare jolts and uneasy ideas one might hope for. As Godzilla faces down two long-gestating monsters who feast on radiation and devastate all in their wake the sight feels more like a particularly high-gloss videogame than it does an apocalyptic struggle with the world in the balance more like ""Monday Night RAW"" than the opening of the seven seals. If theres a bright light here its Edwards whose first film ""Monsters"" was made for less than 100000 while still delivering strange sights actual characters and a sense of something going on under all the trappings. He has an infinitely bigger budget here and while that comes with some liberties and more than a few obligations it does not ensnare him as disastrously as it has other directors whove made the same leap. There are a few uninspired moments -- a shot that multiplies the scale of a similar shot in ""Jaws"" with a fraction of the same impact a pulsating literally-and-figuratively transparent egg-sac that evokes both Camerons ""Aliens"" and Emmerichs disastrous 1998 take on the material -- and that mars the movie too. The original ""Godzilla"" turned our greatest fears into uneasy entertainment; the most uneasy thing about this new film is how eager it is to simply entertain in hope of a legacy of sequels.

Upgrading to the studio arena with ""Godzilla"" Edwards again manages to show more than tell even as his substantially upgraded resources allow him to show much more. With its legendary creature given a matching scale the titanic story of the worlds most famous deep-sea invader doesnt always gel with Edwards greater interest in the storys human elements. But its exactly this component that creates a radical contrast to the cartoonish 1998 version of the story from master of overstatement Roland Emmerich. Edwards ""Godzilla"" has its fair share of plot holes and questionable twists but just as the reptilian beast keeps battling ahead the movie attempts to wrestle outrageous material into something worthy of serious consideration. READ MORE Gareth Edwards On His Little Passion Project Godzilla and Why Hes Bracing for a Meltdown While theres no doubting the prominent role of its eponymous figure ""Godzilla"" spends nearly an hour building up to its first gratifying reveal. Before then its predominant focus is the tale of an American physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) stationed in the late nineties at a Japanese nuclear power plant with his wife fellow researcher Sandy (Juliette Binoche) and their young son. Following a traumatic event with cryptic origins the family is torn apart -- at which point we shift to modern times when Joes son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has grown into a young lieutenant for the U.S. military and attempts a normal life with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen). Drawn back to Japan after hearing about his disgraced fathers ongoing attempts to determine the cause of the accident years earlier Ford finds his father in mad scientist mode spouting theories about echolocation and the presence of a giant being somewhere beneath the waves. In these introductory scenes ""Godzilla"" retains the aura of mystery associated with Steven Spielbergs better spectacles hinting at ominous forces and relishing in the excitement of possibilities lurking just out of sight. Yet for all the mastery of its build ""Godzilla"" cant possibly satisfy our curiosity as well as it generates it. As soon as the first supernatural creature comes to life the movie automatically loses touch with the sophisticated characters at its center. After poking around together at the site of Joes former employment the pair comes across a research facility harboring a huge dormant being feeding off radiation that the scientists have termed M.U.T.O. (an acronym for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). While incarcerated by Japanese authorities led by the researcher Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) the creature wakes up revealing a large shadowy winged entity that suggests Mothra by way of the Batplane. From there the plot neatly falls together Another M.U.T.O. arrives from the depths of the planet and the two creatures set on a path toward San Francisco presumably to mate; detecting their activity the ever-elusive Godzilla shows up to intervene. Government authorities track their every move and strategize about desperate measures but despite the implication that many smaller events are taking place around this massive showdown no amount of intelligent pacing can fully obscure the basic elements in play Ultimately ""Godzilla"" involves a gigantic lizard fighting other huge beings and destroying the city in the process. But its fascinating to watch Edwards and his collaborators attempt to work around the movies inevitabilities. The atmosphere is grimmer and the dialogue less blunt than the generally cheesy Toho-produced Japanese installments but ""Godzilla"" is especially notable for how often it turns away from the central events until theres no other choice but to allow them to dominate. A snazzy opening credits sequence stretches back to the dawn of the nuclear age using 8mm film and military documents to hint at a clandestine attempt by the American government to eliminate the monster with nuclear devices decades ago. Culminating with a sudden blast and only a fleeting glance of the beast emerging from the waves the slick collage seemingly addresses the countless viewers bringing a set of expectations to the table By effectively positioning Godzilla as a mythological figure shrouded in vagaries it sets us up for an entirely new way of looking at him. Thats an ideal scene-setter for the following two hours which attempt a realistic immersion into the outcome of cataclysmic developments. Every seemingly prominent character is buried in the pileup of backroom strategy sessions and military prep work as millions trace the monsters path of destruction on innumerable screens. While the original ""Godzilla"" smartly echoed nuclear fears at the time the new installment has more of an apolitical element exploring the unfocused means by which globe-spanning events are processed by the mainstream media In multiple circumstances Edwards cuts away from tidbits of showdowns between Godzilla and the two M.U.T.O. creatures to play up the ripple effect of their behavior with snapshots of blaring news headlines on televisions often spotted in the background of dire conversations. The effect is at once enthralling and frustratingly muddled chopping up the suspense instead of allowing it develop urgency. The screenplay (credited by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham but reportedly tailored by several others over the last two years) contains the usual blend of made-up scientific blather and military gobbledygook and it struggles from setting up too many ingredients leading to several loose ends. But Edwards seems far more interested in taking this silly premise as seriously as possible a mandate thats particularly notable in the movies look. As he did before with the New York showdown in ""The Avengers"" cinematographer Seamus McGarvey captures the grey-toned cityscape of the climactic San Francisco battle in impressive wide shots that reflect the sheer helplessness of human defense measures. Unfortunately with the monster-on-monster action almost exclusively set at night the finale of sparring of silhouettes leaves much to be desired. While the spindly creatures of ""Monsters"" maintained a cryptic poetry that matched the movies subdued means of depicting a broken world ""Godzilla"" doesnt have that workaround so its dark-hued climax feels like something of a cheat. Still the path it takes to get there contains a number of startling visual details. The strong suit in ""Godzilla"" isnt coherent storytelling so much as the individual moments sprinkled throughout. Edwards finds poetry in the pauses between the battles an ant-sized human locks eyes with the ginormous Godzilla as he tumbles into dust and fog; a spectacularly-rendered parachuting sequence includes one jumpers perspective of Godzilla through the mans goggles. Naturally ""Godzilla"" must deliver on the promise of its title and even with its nighttime workarounds it doesnt entirely disappoint. A lengthy pan upwards of the 30-story figure capably foregrounds his hulking presence. Once it gets there however ""Godzilla"" becomes the very movie it consciously avoids -- a spectacle in which the people barely matter at all. Even as Edwards keeps pushing his cast back into the picture disaster-laden images overwhelm the human element. Only Cranston delivers an expertly textured performance veering away from his lunatic on ""Breaking Bad"" to convey an equally tragic figure driven by obsessive tendencies. When the story turns away from him after the first act his absence is felt through the mechanical qualities hindering the rest of the cast Watanabe generally just looks shocked and amazed while Taylor-Johnsons one-note hero barely emotes at all and the brilliant David Stathairn surfaces as a barking admiral on autopilot. But the most frustrating aspect of the uninspired cast is a strange neglect of the storys female characters Both Olsen and the recently Oscar-nominated Sally Hawkins (who plays Watanabes assistant) hardly do more than express worry when the camera calls for it. The actors underdeveloped aspects make it hard to care much about the stakes at hand We hear minor characters chatter about the prospects of nuclear defense mechanisms but the possibilities come and go so quickly that they never develop any genuinely thrilling qualities. Still Edwards manages to sustain a grim cerebral atmosphere all the way through as if fighting the inevitable demands of the material. The movie contains enough basic money shots to please hardcore Godzilla fans without indulging in them at every opportunity. By contemporary blockbusters standards its practically a minimalist enterprise. As with ""Monsters"" Edwards newest project requires careful consideration albeit for different reasons. What it lacks in plot development in makes up in a series of unstated implications particularly with respect to the motivations of the big guy in question. Godzilla may look like a threat but as anyone versed in various installations of the franchise knows hes often closer to a solution when other colossal horrors enter the picture. The projects intentions are rendered in similar shades of ambiguity Is it a layered form of big budget artistry under the guise of simpler concerns--or a typical CGI-heavy tentpole with some modicum of ingenuity? Edwards certainly displays a penchant for working against the expectations of crass product. That valiant struggle casts the battle of art and commerce in a curious spotlight Like Godzilla himself the movies substance is simultaneously alien and familiar. Grade B Warner Bros. releases ""Godzilla"" nationwide on Friday.

Yes the film is good in the initial stage and the build up is perfect. Also agree with the blandness of the leading man - though one youtube reviewer points out that real life millitary personnel are stoic too (maybe not the best choice of occupation by the screenwriter then). But I think the rating is too high for a flawed film like this. The real problem with Godzilla is not that it abandons its humans - it is that they do not matter at all in the film. Godzilla is practically the protagonist and that in my opinion is a glaring hole in the plot. I would have loved to see mankind devastated by this ""God of monsters"". Instead we get to see heroic rescue shots featuring not the army or the scientists - but the beast. The mugshot of the monster looks almost benevolent - like a mutated overweight bulldog that wants to save your ass and jump back into the ocean after doing that. Maybe the biggest reason I was disappointed with it was that the trailers suggested a very different tone than the final film. The trailers seemed to say that ""Look here is a beast that H-bombs wont kill. It exists in our world and it is going to end civilization and nothing we do can stop it"" There was a desperation in the shot of men falling into a burning city against a monster that the camera could not capture in one shot. That was nowhere to be seen in the movie. All in all I enjoyed the movie for what it was worth. It was a nicely made movie with some very good atmospheric scenes. But it did not terrify me and it did not make me worry for its central cast of characters. I would not rate it a game changer reconfiguring the blockbuster genre.

They both became famous for doing one specific thing smashing cities and battling other giant monsters and swimming and diving in complexly choreographed musical numbers respectively. When you think back on Williams lavish musicals for MGM however youll be hard-pressed to remember a single moment that doesnt take place in or under the water. Similarly affectionate recollections of the Japanese Godzilla films have more to do with screeching and stomping and showdowns with Mothra and Hedorah than they do with those interminable scenes of concerned scientists and distraught moms. See video Godzilla Isnt Alone in New Trailer Packed With Monsters All that padding was a necessity of budget neither building a miniature Tokyo nor putting a guy in a rubber suit to step on it comes cheap so youve got to fill the rest of the film with relatively inexpensive scenes of guys in lab coats anxiously staring at radar screens. Now that a big Hollywood studio like Warner Bros. is making its own ""Godzilla"" of course you would imagine that they could go wild with the special effects and give us scene after scene of Godzilla inflicting property damage and saving humanity from scaly slimy leviathans right? Apparently not if this new movie is any indication. When Godzilla all too infrequently gets to be on screen to do his thing ""Godzilla"" hits that monster-movie sweet spot with the kind of action that kaiju fans have come to crave. Most of the time however this feels like a retread of ""World War Z"" with a handsome American trotting the globe in the hopes of quelling an international crisis. The handsome American this time is soldier Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson); we learn in flashbacks that he spent his childhood in Japan where his nuclear engineer parents Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) worked on a reactor until an underground earthquake caused a catastrophe that killed several people and closed down the entire area due to supposed radioactivity. See video How the U.S. Air Force Would Fight Godzilla for Real Over the years Joe has become a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist convinced that there was more to the earthquake than the government would admit and it turns out hes right. The reactor awakened two flying monstrous creatures (their flat heads make them resemble Gyaos from the Gamera movies but they arent Mothra despite early internet reports) on different continents; these hideous beasts will travel the world toward each other leaving destruction in their wake in the hopes of mating. And while the U.S. military (led by David Strathairn) insists on trying to use force to keep them apart -- never mind that these monsters literally eat nukes for breakfast -- scientist Ichiro (Ken Watanabe) and his sidekick Vivienne (Sally Hawkins) know that mother nature has provided a creature to restore balance. Cue the Big Gs theme music. (Actually dont; Alexandre Desplat provides an often-rousing score but hes chosen not to reference the familiar Akira Ifukube theme from the original Godzilla epics.) Also read Godzilla The Japanese Original Stomps Into Limited Release Director Gareth Edwards (""Monsters"") gets the money shots right but neither he nor screenwriter Max Borenstein (working from a story by David Callaham) makes the human characters interesting enough to get us through two mostly Godzilla-free acts. Three of the best actresses in contemporary cinema -- Binoche Hawkins and Elizabeth Olsen (as Fords wife) -- are reduced mostly to set dressing while Watanabe Cranston and Strathairn get one note to play over and over. As for Taylor-Johnson hes a very pretty blank here. While ""Godzilla"" stages many of its battles at night or in the rain at least cinematographer Seamus MacGarvey (""The Avengers"") keeps things visible unlike many of the murkier moments of ""Pacific Rim."" IMAX audiences wont be disappointed with the clarity of the action even when it unfolds in foggy San Francisco. (To be fair yes this version is a marked improvement over the disastrous 1998 ""Godzilla"" from director Roland Emmerich. But thats like saying the recent ""Robocop"" remake is better than food poisoning.) See photo Godzilla Draws Fire in New IMAX Poster Is it too much to ask that a ""Godzilla"" movie feature more Godzilla than say ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" features Hamlet? Sixty years after debuting on the big screen Godzilla is still a global superstar; if Americans are going to build big-budget movies around him they could at least give this legend more screen time. Esther Williams after all could be counted on to hit the pool within the first 10 minutes. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
