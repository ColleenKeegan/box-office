A striking adaptation of Dostoevskys ""Notes From Underground"" Zeki Demirkubuzs existential drama ""Inside"" convincingly transposes the novellas action to contemporary Ankara and allows the Turkish multihyphenate to once again explore the bestial side of human nature. Riveting viewers with a tour-de-force performance from lead Engin Gunaydin and eye-catching cinematography the technically sublime pic should prove more accessible to international audiences than Demirkubuzs previous work has and enjoy a longer shelf life as a modern take on a literary classic. Further fest play is assured. The pic world-preemed in Istanbuls national competition where it garnered director and actor kudos as well as a peoples choice award from Turkeys Radikal newspaper. Distributor Tiglon opened it in Turkish theaters following the festival screening. One of literatures most notable antiheros comes to life as slothful civil servant Mr. Muharrem (Gunaydin) a social outsider locked in his own obsessive world. Intelligent but oversensitive he is disillusioned by the corruption of the society in which he lives. The intense elliptical story of his self-destructive tendencies and insatiable desire for the shameful unfolds through his highly self-conscious point of view and occasional voiceover narration. Like other Demirkubuz protagonists Muharrem is a troubled soul quick to take offense and convinced that others despise him. Overly self-involved he lives alone in near-squalor watching wildlife behavior programs on television and masturbating on the couch. When not paralyzed by self-doubt he wanders in dark places and has joyless sex with prostitutes. Envious mean-spirited and unable to give or receive love he is both villain and victim. One of the main narrative threads involves Muharrems perverse desire to attend a dinner honoring a former friend (Serhat Tutumluer) now an award-winning author to rankle him for past offenses. Another centers on Muharrems unhappy cleaning lady (Nihal Yalcin) and the abuses she suffers at the hands of their landlord. The most visually striking but narratively murky strand revolves around the protags interactions with a melancholy prostitute (Nergis Ozturk). Much of a piece thematically with Demirkubuzs other tales of darkness ""Inside"" also boasts slyly humorous moments. Many of these involve the eggs Muharrem voraciously consumes and the motif of men howling like beasts. The protags calmly delivered but irrational suggestion of a murder plot also elicits titters. Recognized for his literary approach to filmmaking Demirkubuz early on took Dostoevskys leitmotifs as the inspiration for his entire oeuvre having devoured the novelists writings as a young political prisoner. His take on ""Notes"" is highly cinematic and finds an equivalent for the words and punctuation of the source material via visual composition editing sound and performance. Appearing flabby and unwashed star Gunaydin (a well-known comedian playing against type) makes human frailty palpable as a man tormented by his heightened consciousness; he uses body language brilliantly as shots of him in his grimy briefs speak volumes about his life. Although they receive less screen time the other actors are fine. Widescreen nighttime lensing with the high-resolution Alexa (Arriflexs answer to the Red One) allows the helmers technical precision to reach new heights. The painterly compositions stress Muharrems alienation and isolation and the layered sound work is sensational.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The worst movie of this very new year has a good chance to retain the title for all of 2012. Ripping off The Exorcist while adding the ""found footage"" scam from the Paranormal Activity franchise The Devil Inside manages not only to scrape the barrels bottom but to drill a hole in said bottom and funnel deeper into the scum. And yet this bilge took in a whopping 35 million on its opening weekend showing the publics appetite for scares. So why couldnt The Devil Inside deliver better on its promise? The simple answer is  it doesnt have to. Audiences are so primed for horror they fall for the flashy marketing. After seeing this crap movie were all ready to scream our rage at the screen. The plot goes from dumb to dumber as we follow a dutiful daughter (Fernanda Andrade) who begs two priests (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) to perform an exorcism on her mother (Suzan Crowley) whos been locked up in a funny farm since committing a triple homicide. Poor mom. It wasnt her it was the devil inside. From the amateur acting writing and directing to an ending that is shocking only in its stupidity The Devil Inside will make you puke for all the wrong reasons. It sure as hell wont be terror.

Director William Brent Bell. (127) R Language jolts. At area theaters. ""Its not a matter of possession"" says someone in ""The Devil Inside."" ""Its a matter of brain function."" Or in this case a lack of it. A terrible recombination of the ""found footage"" trend (see the ""Paranormal Activity"" films ""Apollo 18"" etc.) with the exorcism genre of horror ""The Devil Inside"" pulls out all the stops -- profane language odd contortions a fear of religiosity nuns -- as it stumbles along to what may arguably be the most abrupt nonsensical ending since Luis Bunuel stopped slicing cows eyes for the sake of surrealism. ""Devil Inside"" is supposed to be the chronicle of an amateur filmmaker who follows a woman in Italy named Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) as she recounts how her life ""becomes defined by exorcism."" Her mother is in an asylum drugged up and shut in for some 20 years following a horrific multiple murder despite her daughters assertion that she was and is still possessed by a demon. (The marking on the inside of her lower lip is either a sign of that or perhaps of very bad dental care.) Isabella enlists the help of a priest Father David to get the demon out of her mother. The demon of course resists. This is the kind of exorcism movie where the demon calls the (naturally disenfranchised disaffected) priest by the title ""priest"" and people say they try to keep all religious symbolism out of the victims eyeline despite there being crucifixes everywhere. And then sure enough the demon decides to keep trading up in human hosts so that eventually its in more bodies than Joan Rivers. The fact that ""The Devil Inside"" tries to fob itself off as some pseudo-scientific exploration of something that really happened in 2009 isnt new; thats what these types of movies have done since 1999s ""The Blair Witch Project"" made people believe a pile of sticks was a thing to fear. What is new is the level of craven brazen unambiguous shell-game the filmmakers engage in. The fact that the movie ends with a note saying ""For more information about the ongoing investigation visit this website..."" is more shocking than the car crash that precedes it. Director William Brent Bell didnt even bother to put a slight trill of tubular bells behind the end credits; that would have been too ""artistic."" ""Exorcism rites can take minutes or years"" says the priest. Minutes actually seem like years during ""The Devil Inside"" and instead of upturned eyeballs itll likely produce an epidemic of eye-rolling. Magic Moment A baptism goes bad. Really bad. As in ""Get that baby out of the holy water"" bad. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In 1989 Mom slaughtered three people who were conducting an exorcism on her (pity the fool who tried to write that years round-robin family Christmas letter) and is now languishing in a psychiatric hospital in Rome. With the Catholic church unwilling to help Isabella recruits two renegade exorcists (Simon Quarterman Evan Helmuth) to take on her mothers quite literal demons while an increasingly creeped-out documentarian (Ionut Grama) captures the ensuing mayhem with his cameras. Alas the mayhem doesnt ensue for all that long. While this religio-horror effort does contain some nice scares and a memorably unnerving turn from Crowley The Devil Insides biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends -- just as it hits its stride. The result is a found-footage movie whose third act remains missing. C+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"The Devil Inside review Any actual horror seemingly exorcised - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesThe Devil Inside review Any actual horror seemingly exorcisedTired faux documentary footage and poorly executed exorcism scenes are just a few of the problems The Devil Inside cant shake.January 07 2012|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Suzan Crowley left and Fernanda Andrade star in ""The Devil Inside."" (Paramount )People of the world If you find some footage leave it be. You will likely be doing the rest of us a huge favor. ""The Devil Inside"" is the latest in the apparently endless supply of ""found footage"" fake documentaries that present themselves as cobbled together from the artifacts of a hapless filmmaker on an especially doomed project. A woman confesses to a triple homicide and is eventually shipped to a hospital for the criminally insane in Rome with ties to the Vatican. (Its seemingly no big deal for an American citizen to be extradited to an Italian mental facility for a crime committed in Connecticut.) Twenty years later the womans daughter travels to Italy to find out if her mother is mentally ill or possessed. There is of course a cameraman in tow and after walking into a class for exorcists they team up with two young priests who practice their own techniques outside the guidelines of the church. Part of what makes the movie so frustrating in its essential flatness is that there is an interesting idea for a film tucked away in all that something about the intersection of mental illness and possession the point where faith must pick up what science can no longer explain. But instead of exploring that there is lots of tedious exposition with an over-reliance on direct-to-camera confessionals as dutiful setup to a handful of dreadfully handled exorcism scenes. One of the key ad images for the film an elderly nun whose eyes have no pupils is seen only in passing and there is a lame attempt to milk a big scare out of a dog barking on the street. Directed by William Brent Bell from a script co-written with Matthew Peterman ""The Devil Inside"" plays like a horror film conceived on graph paper. The film is being released under Paramounts low-budget Insurge Pictures banner and its filmmakers apparently could not afford an ending.

Starring Fernanda Andrade Simon Quarterman Evan Helmuth Ionut Grama Suzan Crowley Director William Brent Bell Running time 127 Release Opened Jan 6 2012  Editorial Review Low-budget low-concept zero-plausibility horror movieBy Mark JenkinsSaturday Jan. 7 2012The premise of ""The Devil Inside"" is that supernatural evil is contagious. But hey we knew that. Look how the scourge of the phony-found-footage horror movie leaped from ""The Blair Witch Project"" to the ""Paranormal Activity"" series to this low-budget low-concept zero-plausibility flick. Its a pestilence of infectious claptrap. The story directed and co-written by William Brent Bell riffs on the Roman Catholic exorcism rite you may have seen in some other movie. So naturally most of the action is set in the shadow of the Vatican not far from the tourist sites debased by ""Angels and Demons."" (""Devil"" was shot in Romania but that sounds a bit like Rome.) The actual terror begins in Anytown USA where Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) brutally killed two priests and a nun. Seems they were trying to evict a demon. Found not guilty by reason of insanity Maria is sent to an asylum near the Tiber perhaps because fresh pasta is good for schizophrenia. Twenty years later Marias now-grown daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) travels to Rome to visit her mom. Naturally shes making a documentary about the trip so she drags along a video guy Michael (Ionut Grama). He doesnt have a big role in the story but hes a heck of a cameraman; he gets every blurry hand-held shot the movie needs even ones that are technically impossible. Isabella soon falls in with two young priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth) who are renegade exorcists. They tend to victims of demonic possession that their church superiors refuse to acknowledge taking an oh-so-scientific approach to medieval superstition. They let Isabella and Michael videotape a dark-basement exorcism during which a spiritually polluted young woman screams levitates and contorts her limbs to the accompaniment of loud cracking noises that would make any vertebrate wince. Naturally the boys want to try their techniques on Maria. One problem though Sometimes a freshly exorcised fiend gloms onto an innocent bystander turning him or her into a twisted howling bag of hate. You can see where this is going and the filmmakers can see that you can see. So they rush to the hideous yet hilarious climax in little more than an hour and then pad the running time with the slowest-moving credits ever. Even Satan trapped for all eternity in his sulfurous kingdom would probably get antsy watching them crawl - except for one thing the name of the movies contortionist Pixie Le Knot. Good to know that someone has a sense of humor about this diabolical foolishness.Contains violence grisly images and profanity.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 05 2012 1150PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English This is the time of year for hot cups of cocoa warm woollen mittens and oh yeah low-budget exorcism movies. And just your luck theres one opening today. As many of you know January can be scary when it comes to visiting the multiplex. In this case I dont mean low-budget-exorcism-movie-scary but rather roller-coaster-ride-scary - an unpredictable mix of highs and lows. Films released early in the new year are typically either art films that would have been lost in the holiday gift pack of awards contenders or studio pictures you suspect are getting dumped perhaps with a gentle marketing shove. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new horror film ""The Devil Inside"" Movies The Devil Inside The official trailer Which brings us to The Devil Inside the low-budget exorcism movie in question (and in case you were wondering not a screen version of the well known INXS single). The Devil Inside was not previewed for the media in time to make Friday print editions. For jaded film reviewers this is generally an ominous sign. Paramount which bought the independently-made film clearly wants to avoid the opinions of critics who might not you know ""get it"" and repeat the word-of-mouth Twitter-verse buzz that turned a low-budget flick it bought in 2007 called Paranormal Activity into a box-office juggernaut that spawned two sequels. While it doesnt exactly reinvent the inverted cross The Devil Inside definitely puts a nifty indie spin on the demonic possession genre. With a cast of competent unknowns including lively foreign bit players the film is mostly set and partly filmed in Rome. Thats Rome Italy. This is an asset because unfortunately the style is faux documentary which was used to great effect in another nifty low-budget film The Last Exorcism which was released last summer. The screenplay was co-written by director William Brent Bell another unknown entity who sets a brisk pace and sustains it throughout. The film opens with a tidy set-up. In 1989 Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) called 911 to report that she had killed three people - two priests and a nun who were conducting an exorcism on her. Ten years later her daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) decides to find out what really happened that night - is her mother mentally ill or is something else going on? Conveniently for us she decides to make a documentary about her quest. This involves travelling to Rome where her mother is locked up in the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Does the film need to explain why her mother was mysteriously moved from the U.S. to Rome? Nope. She arrives with her cameraman (Ionut Grama who provides much of the comic relief) and soon meets a pair of young priests (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) trained by the Vatican to conduct official exorcisms. After some mumbo-jumbo chatter that sounds like it was lifted straight from the script research they reveal theyve got a little off-the-books business. When the Vatican wont give approval to conduct an exorcism on a clearly possessed person the priest duo steps in to help. They take Isabella to one of their sessions - a dark and chilling but not particularly frightening scene - after which she convinces them to visit her mother and assess her. When the sedative drugs wear off Maria seems stable but then the voices unusual strength and bugged-out eyes begin. Crowley is eerily convincing a real treat particularly if you enjoy scenes of demonic possession. Since the spoiler watchers are out there lets just say well after that all hell breaks loose and its a heck of a lot of fun to watch. The Devil Inside ends rather abruptly which may annoy some viewers but leaves things open. After all if the first new release of 2012 receives paranormal box-office activity The Devil Is Still Inside is sure to follow.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Buried somewhere within the abysmal new faux-documentary The Devil Inside lies a zany 80s-style lowbrow comedy about competition between renegade exorcist slobs and hoity-toity rule-following exorcist snobs at the Vatican Exorcism School. The hilariously convoluted thriller contains all the elements for a wacky parody of exorcism movies except a sense of humor about itself The Devil Inside never acknowledges its innate ridiculousness so the laughs are unintentional. Fernanda Andrade stars as a traumatized young woman whose mother has been held in a Catholic mental hospital in Rome since the late 1980s after killing three people during an unsuccessful attempt to rid her of unsightly demons. With a camera crew in tow a now grown-up Andrade travels to Italy to look for answers behind her mothers curious condition. While sitting in at Exorcism School Andrade befriends two people who perform unauthorized exorcisms in their spare time and--like everyone in The Devil Inside--are happy to have a fragile possibly mentally ill woman and a camera crew following them around as they perform their secret private life-and-death work. Andrade seemingly has free rein over all of Italy; nobody for example thinks twice about granting her unsupervised visits with her deeply unhinged potentially violent mother. The Devil Inside is considerate enough to highlight its shortcomings in dialogue Andrade underlines one of the scripts main flaws when she admits her mothers botched exorcism and her response to it completely define her as a person. And its difficult to argue with the director of this supposed documentary when he frets that hes devolved into an obnoxious asshole with a camera. The Devil Inside keeps adding elements and plot points it has no interest in resolving It doesnt build to a close so much as it gives up unexpectedly with a shockingly abrupt ending. The Devil Inside opens with the exquisitely unnecessary information that the Vatican did not endorse the film nor aid in its making. The filmmakers flatter themselves unnecessarily if they imagine this schlock is worthy of the Churchs consideration let alone cause for close collaboration. The Catholic Church was wise to want nothing to do with The Devil Inside. Everyone else should follow suit.

Even before the first scene theres a title card informing us that ""the Vatican did not endorse this film nor aid in its completion."" Thats huge Normally the Roman Catholic church is heavily involved in the production of cheap uncreative horror films Its pretty much their main focus. Why I cant remember the last awful scary movie I saw that didnt have the Vatican logo on it I wish that ""disclaimer"" were the dumbest thing about this derivative faux-documentary but it isnt. Not by a long shot. The dumbest thing about it is that even though it doesnt feature a single original idea or scary moment a group of movie-industry professionals chose to put it in theaters. Theaters that charge admission And it never even rises to the level of Fun Bad where at least you can find enjoyment in the train wreck. A train cant wreck if it never tries to go anywhere. Its like they tried to make the blandest most derivative least memorable horror movie possible carefully avoiding anything that might resemble actual entertainment. Like 98 percent of all horror movies made in the last five years The Devil Inside pretends that it is a documentary. The subject is Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) a young woman whos trying to find out what happened to her mother Maria (Suzan Crowley) during an exorcism 20 years ago. The filmmaker Michael (Ionut Grama) follows Isabella to Rome where her mother is being held in a mental hospital. Mom has been under lock and key ever since some Catholics tried to exorcise the demons out of her and she killed them (the Catholics). At some point she got transferred to this Italian facility because for sure the United States is always handing criminally insane people over to foreign asylums just for fun. Anyway Isabella drops in on a class at the Vaticans School of Exorcism which not only exists but permits random tourists to drop in. There she befriends two young priests named Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth) who have a secret project where they try to cast the demons out of people the Church has given up on. After visiting Mom in the loony bin Isabella is convinced shes still possessed by Satan (or by whichever of Satans interns was assigned to her 20 years ago) and so then theres a lot of wheel-spinning and time-wasting before the movie finally gets to the point which is obviously to have Ben and David try to exorcise Isabellas mom. All of which sounds like potentially good fodder for a creepy demonic-possession thriller if not exactly a groundbreaking one. But instead its a weak tedious waste of time with even the reliable gimmicks of the genre rendered impotent by apathetic execution. And I really do think ""apathetic"" is the right word. The screenplay by director William Brent Bell and Matthew Peterman isnt just devoid of wit and flavor -- it doesnt even try to have any. (Bell and Peterman were also responsible for 2006s dumb Stay Alive about a deadly video game.) Bell directs with all the enthusiasm of a guy who was called into work on his day off. Most damning of all? The movie has no ending. Apparently unable to devise a climax and resolution for their mundane story Bell and Peterman pulled the old ""and thats where the tape suddenly ran out"" maneuver -- the ultimate lazy cop-out for the found-footage genre. The message is clear the filmmakers didnt feel like coming up with a satisfying conclusion to a movie that already wasnt trying very hard. Moviegoers are sometimes very easily entertained its true but I find it hard to believe that Bell and Peterman honestly believed this pile of nonsense would please anyone.

And if ""The Devil Inside"" 2012s entry in this ever-enervating genre isnt the stupidest of the lot it still maintains the tradition of the years first month offering some of its very worst movies. Mind you this silly film cost a million bucks to make and earned twice that in the Thursday midnight screenings alone so we have only ourselves to blame. Unless the devil made us do it. ""The Devil Inside"" takes the radically new and different tack of being a mock-documentary so the entire film is shot from the POV of a filmmaker who finds himself in a terrifying ... oh you know. Its the same old ""Blair Witch"" rehash this time following Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) to Rome to visit her mother Maria (Suzan Crowley). Maria has been institutionalized since she murdered two priests and a nun in 1989 when Isabella was 7 and mother and daughter havent seen each other in the ensuing 20 years. While the Catholic Church never officially admitted that the murders took place during an attempt to perform an exorcism on Maria the fact that she was transferred from the US to Rome speaks volumes. (""The Devil Inside"" opens with a hilarious disclaimer that the Vatican does not endorse the movie; we already have a contender for this years list of ""no duh"" moments.) Operating without the endorsement of the Holy See Isabella and director Michael (Ionut Grama) enlist the help of exorcism students David (Evan Helmuth) and Ben (Simon Quarterman)to perform the rite on Maria once again. Things dont go well particularly since demons can hop from body to body -- you know like cooties. In the decades since William Friedkins landmark ""The Exorcist"" weve seen this sort of thing in countless movies and its pretty much the same formula -- skeptical outsider earnest priests Catholic pageantry a restrained woman twisted in weird positions and speaking multiple languages and revealing painful truths that the exorcist has kept to himself etc. ""The Devil Inside"" dutifully touches all the bases and to its credit it does muster a few spooky moments. The scenes of exorcism provide some chills thanks mostly to the performances of Crowley (as well as Bonnie Morgan whose contortionist skills are on full display here as another possessee) but director William Brent Bell (""Stay Alive"") and his co-writer Matthew Peterman offer way too much set-up for too little payoff. Once the characters start talking to the camera about the filmmaking process you can feel the actual filmmakers stalling for time. Bell also indulges in a lot of tired horror shtick from the were-making-a-movie-here narrative to the ""camera in a car thats flipping over"" routine that everyones been stealing from ""Let Me In"" of late. And then theres the ending which I wont spoil here -- suffice it to say that Twitter was full of reports of people booing. (While my fellow viewers didnt react quite as viscerally people did laugh out loud and make other sounds that suggested that eyes were rolling all over the auditorium.) ""The Devil Inside"" wont be 90 minutes in hell -- and its more fun to watch than say last years ""The Rite"" -- but youre better off popping in your ""Exorcist"" DVD for the 20th time than venturing out for this hooey.

TWITTER William Brent Bells horror film follows a young womanas investigation into the events that landed her mother in Italyas Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Dabbling in the same shaky handheld horror arena as The Last Exorcism The Devil Inside purports to follow documentary-style a young American womans investigation into the events that landed her mother in Italys Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane two decades earlier. While that 2010 film ultimately failed to deliver on some admittedly chilling atmospherics this latest variation directed and co-written by William Brent Bell never gets off the ground trotting out the same predictable twisting heads and psycho-babble without a whiff of originality or discernible visual flair. PHOTOS The 10 Least Scary Movies of All Time As a result the would-be thriller proves as scary and unsettling as a slab of devils food cake -- only considerably less satisfying. Horror fans hungry for a demonic possession fix could initially take the bait but subsequent word-of-mouth should mean that Paramounts Insurge genre label wont have a new Paranormal Activity on its hands. All that endless talking into cinematographer Gonzalo Amats handheld camera begins back in 1989 with emergency responders working their way through a domestic crime scene in which a distraught woman (Suzan Crowley) has brutally murdered three people--all belonging to her church. Determined to find out what happened to her mother that night daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) with a trusty videographer in tow travels to Italy and hooks up with a pair of ordained priests (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) who happen to perform forbidden ritual exorcisms on the side. PHOTOS Iconic Horror Movies After much debate about whether their subjects are mentally ill or possessed by il diavolo the group finally gets down to the business at hand where Isabellas institutionalized mom is concerned only to get more than they bargained for when it appears shes harboring not one but four demons with nasty powers of transference. Saddled with its tired docu format the production can never extricate itself from all those directly-into-the-lens personal confessions and its constant rehashing of the same previously shown footage to establish any sort of prevailing mood other than random hysteria. With the exception of veteran British actress Crowley whos efficiently disturbing as Isabellas damaged mother the rest of the cast is less convincing coming across as actors self-consciously playing their earnest roles often to chuckle-inducing effect. And then theres that opening statement that ""The Vatican did not endorse this film or aid in its completion."" Good call.

No the Holy See apparently is waiting to back an exorcism movie thats a little less hilariously lame.""The Devil Inside"" joins a long woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures among them ""The Blair Witch Project"" the ""Paranormal Activity"" films and certain wedding videos that wont go away. Twenty years after killing three meddlesome Catholic exorcists an American woman possessed (Suzan Crowley) and confined to an asylum in Rome is visited by her grown daughter (Fernanda Andrade Brazilian-born with an American dialect thats flatter than the flattest thinnest pancake). The daughter and a weaselly documentary filmmaker along for the ride want the truth they want answers and some interesting footage.The Twitter waves of anticipatory love (some rigged some legit) crashed onto the jagged rocks of the first public screenings of ""The Devil Inside"" Thursday night. From the mighty ocean of pre-Thursday tweets""so im trynna see that new movie coming out friday the devil inside. Who coming w me? Lol.""""The Devil Inside seems like such a scary movie omg.""""If I ever watch the devil inside me I will probably end up running out of the movie theater notjoking.""Then came the screening of the movie itself which ends (oh quit with your spoiler concerns) with a scene set inside a car cameras running running running the way theyre ALWAYS running in these found-footage jobs long past any plausibility. The capper pitting soul-hopping devil against his human playthings provoked instant unified derision at the Chicago preview. It was like that all across the country. This films a uniter not a divider One tweet ""Our Austin TX crowd reacted quite uniformly to The Devil Insides final moments. A rare experience."" And from IFCs Matt Singer ""Guessing your audience reacted the exact same way ours in NYC did.""William Brent Bell and Matthew Peterman wrote the film. Bell directed it. It runs 87 minutes and while its only routinely poor until the last two minutes those last two minutes prove that in the right circumstances...the power of crap compels youmjphillipstribune.comThe Devil Inside -- 1 starMPAA rating R (for disturbing violent content and grisly images and for language including some sexual references)Running time 127Opened Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesLocal film taps into devilish 80s horrorMay 30 2008Im Still Here a time-waster believe it or notSeptember 8 2010Provocative Footage Eclipses `Titanica DramaApril 14 1995Film Face LiftsOctober 22 1998The Natural goes back in time gains 15 minutesApril 3 2007Find More Stories AboutFilmDevilScreenTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0106-devil-inside-20120107,0,5472814.column",200,thedevilinside12,thedevilinside,chicagotribune
"`The Devil Inside review It came from Hell |       NJ.com comments `The Devil Inside review It came from Hell Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 06 2012 at 754 AM updated January 06 2012 at 806 AM View/Post Comments (PARAMOUNT)Simon Quarterman looks worried in ""The Devil Inside."" He should be. I know its awfully early but I think Ive already heard my favorite movie slogan of 2012 ""The Vatican does not endorse this film."" I mean really. Really? The venerable institution that signed off on the Crusades the Inquisition and those Mrs. Pauls fishsticks I had to eat on Fridays wouldnt give ""The Devil Inside"" a pass? Well they were right. This vile thing is a heck of a lot worse than Mrs. Pauls tartar-sauced rectangles - and if my old schools Dean of Discipline were still around the cast and crew would all get a trip to detention and maybe a rap or two across the knuckles. Of course I should point out this is all a marketing gimmick. In reality the Holy See is not trying to keep you from seeing this movie (although the studio did try hiding it from critics). The Pope had nothing to do with any of this. And if youre smart neither will you. Made up of parts from ""The Blair Witch Project"" ""The Exorcist"" ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Rite"" - but not the best parts - its another one of those found-footage things in which were supposed to believe that no matter what happened the cameraman never stopped filming (but also never bothered to buy a tripod or learn how to focus). The film begins in 1980s America when two priests and a nun come to exorcise a housewife. The night ends with three new martyrs and a murderous madwoman soon on her way to an Italian asylum for the criminally insane. Why Italy? Dont ask yet. Just stay tuned as 20 years later her grown daughter now goes to Rome to ask that and a few other questions - accompanied by a wannabe documentarian and eventually two unorthodox priests. And pretty soon its time for Italian curses random violence crude sexual suggestions overturned furniture and raspy screams of ""The pig is mine"" You know like ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" but without the shopping. Without the budget either. Horror movies dont have to be lush - in fact theres a certain power to the ones like the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" that had to rely on chocolate syrup and a bucket of butchers offal for special effects. But after ""The Blair Witch Project"" got by with sticks and stones and offscreen noises filmmakers started thinking they didnt have to show anything. Well no. Its better when you dont show too much - but if your story is about the supernatural eventually youre going to have to come up with something. ""The Devil Inside"" cant. Oh it has a few nice European locations and the smart idea of using a contortionist for one of the possessed victims. And Simon Quarterman who plays one of the exorcists is solidly believable at least - hes like what Hugh Dancy might be with a worse agent. But Fernanda Andrade makes no impression as the questing daughter. Suzan Crowley is merely screams and a frightwig as dear old Mom. And like many of its ""inspirations"" - legalese for ""ripped-off sources"" - the whole thing ends in a muddle of action and yelling and the by-now-obligatory shock cut to black. ""What the hell kind of movie was that?"" the kid in front of me asked when it was all over. The kind not endorsed by the Vatican supposedly. Or really by anyone still in possession of their faculties. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. The Devil Inside (R) Paramount (87 min.) Directed by William Brent Bell. With Fernanda Andrade Suzan Crowley. Now playing in New Jersey.

Despite the palpable air of deja vu that hangs over it like a light fog ""The Devil Inside"" generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario. Pic works best during its first half as helmer William Brent Bell gives his low-budget high-concept suspenser the look and feel of a cable TV doc (think ""MSNBC Investigates"" only creepier). But theres a marked downtick in verisimilitude as the faux documentary gradually devolves into found-footage gimmickry. Pics 34.5 opening weekend shows moviegoers are ready for a scare particularly from the first wide-release of the year. Working from a script he co-wrote with co-producer Matthew Peterman Bell kicks off with an effective mix of ersatz newscasts and crime-scene video as Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) a deeply troubled and perhaps demonically possessed housewife and mom is arrested tried and ultimately institutionalized after brutally slaying three would-be exorcists in 1989. Flash-forward to 2009 and Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) Marias grown-up daughter is determined to discover just what the hell happened to her mother -- and why for reasons no one wants to explain Maria was spirited away to a mental hospital across the ocean near Vatican City. Accompanied by documentarian Michael Schaefer (Ionut Grama) who provides the p.o.v. for most of the pic Isabella travels to Italy in the hope of reconnecting with her mom and just as important getting a crash course at whats described as the Vatican School of Exorcism. Two medically trained priests (Simon Quarterman Evan Helmuth) offer to accelerate Isabellas learning curve by allowing her and Michael to accompany them when -- in the pics most potent sequence -- they cast demons from a tormented young woman (Bonnie Morgan). But when the priests attempt a similar cleansing of Maria they learn the hard way that the devil is in the details. And sometimes in the exorcists. Moodily lensed on Italian and Romanian locations by Gonzalo Amat ""The Devil Inside"" benefits from persuasive performances by its lead players (Quarterman and Helmuth are particularly impressive) and special effects that are all the more striking for being used so sparingly. Overall storytelling is adroitly fleet and economical; so economical in fact that the pic clocks in at 83 minutes only because of the slowest final credits roll in recent memory.
