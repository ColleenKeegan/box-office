By David Denby Texas hold em Shirley MacLaine Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey.   Credit Illustration by Carlos Aponte Richard Linklaters ""Bernie"" is devoted to a young man with exceptionally beautiful manners. Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) stout and soft-spoken works as an assistant funeral director in the small town of Carthage in East Texas. He puts on a good show. He dresses the bodies with care (the movie begins with him cosmetically enhancing a corpse); he sings at the services in a lovely light tenor; he consoles the bereaved. When a husband dies he shows up at the widows house with flowers and candy. And his benevolence isnt always self-serving--he gives away money when he has nothing to gain by it and stages musicals at a local school. A gentle closeted gay man he brings light to Carthage gracing the parched town with culture and refinement. No one is surprised when Bernie starts spending time with the wealthy elderly widow Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) a miser given to screaming fits. Who else would put up with her? By degrees Bernie becomes her friend and business manager and eventually her travelling companion and sole heir. And no one is much surprised or bothered when Bernie exhausted by Marjories demands on him (everything we assume but sexual demands) shoots her four times in the back with a .22 rifle normally used for killing armadillos. As far as the town is concerned she deserved it. Anyway Bernie is too sweet a man to be punished for the crime. This comedy of generosity money lust and skewed perception is based on a true story. In 1998 two years after the murder the journalist Skip Hollandsworth wrote about it for Texas Monthly (""Midnight in the Garden of East Texas""). He and Linklater who grew up in East Texas collaborated on a screenplay and after more than a decade finally got the picture made. Its an odd movie--mild in tone and circumspect yet darkly funny and done in a hybrid form that I dont think has been used so thoroughly before. Linklater cast good actors in the leading and subsidiary roles but devotes perhaps forty per cent of the screen time to interviews with the real residents of Carthage who years after the events talk about the actual Bernie and Marjorie. (You see some of the incidents they describe performed by the actors.) ""Id never seen a movie told from the perspective of a group of gossips"" Linklater has said. ""But in this case it seemed like the proper narrative technique that would reveal everything you could ever really know about the town and the people involved."" What it reveals is both touching and strange. On porches in living rooms and in stores ebullient women in bouffant hair and drawling cautious men with neatly trimmed beards and mustaches explain how much they liked and admired Bernie. Some of the women asked him to ""do"" their funerals; even after death they wanted his caressing attention his touch of class. The men are somewhat less ardent. A few noticed that he was gay--""a little light in the loafers""--but they accepted him as a harmless fellow who had a friendly way with everybody. Linklater wickedly suggests that this ingratiating style combined with Christian piety consorts well with a tyrannical Southern insistence on civility. That Bernie was also a liar and a murderer is not something that most of Carthage ever took in. The local voices--foolish proper occasionally stinging--make a daft but instructive music. Linklater has made a smart movie with a mordant satirical edge but he almost falls victim to his own sense of authenticity. The interviews prevent the picture from developing much momentum or suspense. Every time Linklater gets some tension going he returns to the women on the porch. What we need to see is more of the relationship between Bernie and Marjorie which as portrayed here doesnt go much beyond what people describe. We never develop our own understanding of what happened. It might have been fun if Linklater had been a bit more inventive--if he had made a sort of East Texas ""Sunset Boulevard""--but he seems to feel that he would have betrayed his corner of Texas if he had made too much up. Shirley MacLaine with a masklike face and scratchy caterwaul is frightening as the aging termagant but shes hardly on the screen. Matthew McConaughey plays Danny Buck Davidson the indignant and boastful prosecutor who went after Bernie in court. Now forty-two McConaughey has lost some of his buttery blond-beauty dullness. Hes leaner tougher almost acid. Hes the acting surprise of the movie yet its Jack Blacks film. Without him ""Bernie"" would have been little more than an intelligent misfire a curiosity. The comic actor suppresses his smirk and his devilish stare and stays within character. He gives Bernie a mincing walk--but not too mincing. He makes him over-precise in his speech and movements a devious man who knows that graciousness is both armor and weapon. Its a fine disciplined piece of acting and it binds us to the mystery of Bernies character in which self-seeking and the genuine desire to be useful exist side by side. Spreading Marjories money around after shes dead Bernie sets people up in business gives them home-repair cash or a new swing set for the kids. In a kind of epilogue we see the real Bernie Tiede as Jack Black interviews him presumably picking up hints. In prison now busy as ever distributing good cheer and preaching Christian virtue to the inmates Bernie seems a happy man. Whats funnier--intentional or unintentional comedy? Nothing could be more intentional than ""The Three Stooges"" a successful re-creation of the antic mayhem of the finger-in-your-eye trio. The movie is so infantile that it achieves a special kind of purity and gentleness. The Stooges--the enraged Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) the naively hopeful Larry (Sean Hayes) and the massive shrieking baby Curly (Will Sasso)--slap bonk knuckle-punch hammer-blow and stomp on one another. The picture of course is a love story. The old Three Stooges shorts were made in the nineteen-thirties and forties and if you watch them now they look cramped airless and smudged. The slapstick of this movie photographed in color and staged in open space is larger and weirder and its so far divorced from any imaginable reality that it lodges in a pleasant zone of square surrealism. The Farrelly brothers who directed take physical comedy to levels of intricacy not seen since silent movies. The bodies get pretzelled together limbs and heads intertwined the three men working as a unit. Even when separated they seem connected; their conjoined flow is as spiritual as it is physical. The movie runs down--repetition is built into its DNA--and the plot is meaningless. But there are incidental pleasures such as the recurring appearance of Larry David as a bespectacled irascible nun named Sister Mary Mengele. Then theres the unwittingly funny ""Lockout"" starring Guy Pearce as an outer-space Galahad. The movie is set in 2078. The President of the United States daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) who curls her upper lip when shes angry or excited journeys to MS One an experimental prison orbiting the earth where five hundred of the most dangerous--or at least the ugliest--criminals are locked in pods asleep to be removed now and then so that unspeakable experiments can be performed on their bodies. Emilie wants to expose this outrage. But when she gets to the prison a riot breaks out the zombies are released from slumber and shes captured and menaced especially by one Hydell (Joe Gilgun) who has a sunken tattooed chest a head that cranes off to one side and eyes that glare in different directions. The press notes helpfully tell us that Gilgun an Englishman ""comes from one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Manchester"" which makes us wonder who comes from the most dangerous neighborhood in Manchester. He looks like a psychotic turkey. Back on earth Snow (Pearce) yet another C.I.A. guy who has been set up on a murder charge and has gone rogue is dispatched to MS One to liberate Emilie before her father orders the prison destroyed. At the screening in between laughing fits people around me whispered in awed tones ""B movie 1956."" When Snow arrives Emilie is dead and he resurrects her by sticking a syringe through her eyeball to her brain. Awakened she falls into sandpapery sexual banter with him; they slug each other almost as often as Moe and Curly. The rest of the movie consists of the couple escaping into one green air-locked room after another as the prison beasts rage outside. If you were to watch ""Lockout"" a few months from now at home alone it wouldnt produce more than a shrug. Movies this bad need to be revered in public places. Go see it in a mall and try to sneak a beer or two in with you.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Comments click to enlarge Lockout Video Rated PG-13  95 minutes  2012 The latest action flick from French screenwriter Luc Besson begins with a close-up of Guy Pearce sitting in an interrogation room where he responds to every question with a Carson-worthy joke gets slugged in the face each time but just cant stop. The scene is a pretty good forecast of the movie that follows its cliched ridiculous and very entertaining. In the year 2079 the U.S. has built an orbiting penal colony in space where incorrigibles are placed in suspended animation (practical logic is not the movies strong suit).

"Bessons Lockout cobbled together from other movies |       NJ.com comments Bessons Lockout cobbled together from other movies Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 13 2012 at 845 AM View/Post Comments EuropacorpMaggie Grace and Guy Pearce in ""Lockout."" For decades the stock image of French cinema has been films so sophisticated so thoughtful and so full of world-weary melancholy that their greatest climax might be a particularly expressive shrug. For years director Luc Besson has been gleefully putting one meaty thumb firmly in that images eye. His movies -- ""Subway"" ""The Fifth Element"" ""Leon"" -- are over the top fantasy/thrillers with wry muscular heroes boyish heroines and lots of firepower and frenetic editing. There are a few exceptions like his awful Joan of Arc epic or the current ""The Lady"" (occasionally even Besson feels a fatal urge to be serious). But generally theyve been huge successes and as far from classic French films as you can imagine. Theyve been successful enough that Besson now oversees a sort of factory turning out similar movies many of them in English. ""Lockout"" is the latest based on his ""original idea"" but made by other hands. Its not that different from his other movies. In fact its not that different from a lot of other peoples movies. The basic plot -- disgraced but still honorable convict gets a reprieve if he survives a suicide mission and rescues a VIP from a futuristic prison -- is right out of ""Escape From New York."" The two chief villains -- a pair of tattooed murdering brothers with the big one the exasperated ""minder"" of the smaller crazier one -- is a lift from ""From Dusk Til Dawn."" The rest of the thefts -- bits and pieces of ""Blade Runner"" ""Die Hard"" and ""Face/Off"" -- are mostly petty. As is the film. Guy Pearce -- who has pumped up remarkably since he was the languid gigolo of HBOs ""Mildred Pierce"" -- is Snow the stubbly ex-CIA agent whose every line is a tough-guy quip. Maggie Grace is the presidents daughter a soft-hearted reformer whos investigating penal conditions -- when a riot breaks out and shes taken hostage by 500 violent felons. Oh and theres one more problem The prison is in space. Time to get that shuttle out of mothballs -- and break Snow into the penitentiary so he can help the First Daughter break out. Once he reaches the prison though the film itself turns weightless. It has some great sets but does nothing with them or the situation. Although the script puts Snow in radio contact with a friendly agent on the outside theres never any sense of where he is on this floating jailhouse or what the next obstacle is. As for the direction the tag-team of filmmakers seems to have only two ideas -- having stupendously ugly characters shove their mugs into the camera or staging action sequences so dizzily you have no idea whats going on. (An early chase scene on what looks like a borrowed Batpod isnt much more than a painful blur.) Pearce is bearable enough as the wise-cracking and indestructible Snow -- at least he doesnt take himself too seriously. And the films production design from the outer-space prison to its womblike cells is terrific. But then Besson has always been very devoted to his toys. Which perhaps is why his films so rarely have any real people in them. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Lockout (PG-13) FilmDistrict (95 min.)

It was the specific mention of ""oxygen-fed weapons"" guarding said space prison a phrase casually tossed off in a hasty exchange between that prisons warden and the visiting daughter of the President of the United States Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace the taken party in Bessons own Taken). Brought up amid much exposition and before much more silliness ensues its a detail that -- whether created by Besson or one of his co-writers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger (co-directing here) -- suggested a certain modicum of thought going into this fundamentally goofy outing. Lockout goes on to imply that gravity selectively remains whenever our heroes are leaping from spacecraft to spacecraft and that one characters noble self-sacrifice in the name of preserving oxygen would actually result in restoring some of it to a sealed environment. But I digress. You came here to read about Escape from New York But in Space and make no mistake thats exactly what this movie is. Thankfully a brisk pace and Guy Pearces leading turn as Thomas Jane playing Snake Plissken prove vital to lending Lockout a certain matinee-level B-movie charm. Snow (Pearce) a disgraced Secret Service agent has been charged with murdering a government operative and stealing state secrets. The only plea bargain offered by Secret Service head Langrel (Peter Stormare not even trying to hide his accent)? Snow has to ship off into space sneak aboard the very same super-max facility orbiting Earth that was originally intended to imprison him and rescue poor Emilie from many recently thawed riot-happy convicts. Inescapable lens flares and evident PG-13 trims aside Mather and St. Leger generally take a no-nonsense approach to this all-nonsense material back-loading the film with the quest for Snows innocence on Earth (where highway chases resemble a garish blur of would-be digital wizardry) and keeping plenty of clocks a-tickin while our protagonist takes a lickin. The films first scene sees Snow spitting out quips and blood as he endures a beating and Pearce quickly establishes his wise-cracking and vitally endearing persona as a hardboiled knucklehead worth following into low-gravity situations. Once he and Grace finally team up she proves to be a surprisingly suitable foil -- easily disgusted by Snows demeanor of course but viably vulnerable and nowhere near as aggravatingly dim as her previously abducted character in a Luc Besson project. Together they go about avoiding chief villains Alex (a cool-headed Vincent Regan) and Hydell (Joseph Gilgun spastic to a fault) resuscitating one another with needles through the eye (dont ask) and trying to find Snows brain-fried partner-in-crime among countless tattooed ruffians. Lockout may never get quite as silly-inspired as ""oxygen-fed weapons"" again but it does a fine job of continually coming up with obstacle after obstacle for our two leads to dodge -- not the least of which happens to be good old-fashioned logic.

Its filling all right satisfying a basic hunger for red meat and carbs but with nary a sprig of garnish (let alone a side salad). Enjoy it in moderation. Its your recommended weekly allowance of schlock. Set on a futuristic floating penitentiary in space the sci-fi action adventure stars Guy Pearce as Snow a tough guy who has been framed - naturally - but who is offered his freedom if he agrees to rescue the presidents do-gooder daughter (Maggie Grace) after she is taken hostage by convicts during an uprising. Of course Snow says yes. Actually its more like some smart-alecky rejoinder than a simple ""yes."" Snow is a poor mans John McClane the Bruce Willis character in the ""Die Hard"" movies. He spends virtually all of ""Lockout"" either kicking tail or cracking wise even when hes getting punched in the head. The dialogue between Snow and Graces Emilie after shes rescued but before they can escape from the orbiting prison is boilerplate movie banter half sexual flirtation and half nyuk-nyuk jokes about say bowling. Yes bowling. The script by first-time feature writer-directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger is functional though filled with as much flat-footed repartee as holes. Although based on an ""original"" idea by filmmaker Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element"") the movie is anything but. Youve seen it a dozen times and it makes no more sense this time. After the first half-hour its easy to forget that its set in outer space and not say on Alcatraz Island (""The Rock"") or on an airplane (""Con Air""). The only interesting character tension comes from a pair of violent prisoners who also happen to be bickering brothers with thick Scottish accents (Vincent Regan and Joseph Gilgun). There is one mildly interesting plot complication. Although Snow has ostensibly agreed to save Emilie he has an ulterior motive in accepting the prison mission. It seems an accomplice (Tim Plester) in the events leading to Snows wrongful conviction also happens to be an inmate of the floating jail and might hold a secret that could exonerate our hero. So theres that too. It adds a bit of spice to the proceedings but not much. Its ketchup not steak sauce. The de rigueur twist ending isnt that great either. In fact a critic sitting next to me had to ask what just happened at the end of the film after he looked away from the screen for a second and missed a crucial shot. Thats never a good sign. If the films big payoff scene is so blink-and-you-miss-it quick the filmmakers had better work a little harder to keep our eyes glued to the screen. Contains action violence some obscenity and sexual dialogue.

Besson co-wrote and produced this cheesy mash-up of elements from James Bond and ""Battlestar Galactica."" Directed by James Mather and Stephen St. Leger its the kind of movie where someone tumbling in space above the earths atmosphere opens a parachute and lands gently on earth without even gasping for a breath. Guy Pearce plays Snow a rogue spy who issues sardonic one-liners while being beaten by dudes from the CIA who think hes been giving away state secrets. (Actually hes been protecting them.) All of this is mixed up with a missing briefcase Snow was given by a dead fellow agent whom he is wrongly accused of killing. Snow is about to be sent to the space station/prison as an inmate but instead he goes there as a rescuer after the inmates riot and take over the place. Their chief hostage is the presidents daughter (Maggie Grace) who is visiting on a fact-finding mission but the rioters dont know that. The long episode in space which features a few mild fights and shootouts amounts to a long detour from the main plot which manages to be both convoluted and dull at the same time. The chemically induced coma with which the bad guys threaten to punish our hero sounds more interesting than anything in this movie.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 13 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 12 2012 917PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Far off in some mean future a VIP is held hostage by gnarly inmates in a maximum-security prison whereupon a wisecracking anti-hero gets dispatched on a one-man rescue operation. Nope this isnt 1981s Escape from New York but its certainly headed in that general direction - same old premise same old banter. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new action film ""Lockout"" starring Guy Pearce and Maggie Grace Movies Lockout The official trailer Different result though. Over 30 years and many computer generations later Lockout somehow manages to lose the suspense from the tale and even more impressively to deaden the special effects. On the other hand it does a splendid job of putting the pale into imitation and draining the life out of derivative. The time is 2079 apparently far enough into the century that Guy Pearce has acquired a whole new body. My but our Guy has bulked up since his Mildred Pierce days the better to play Agent Snow a barrel-chested and squinty-eyed laconic fellow who treats dialogue like tweets. Snow used to be white but now he has fallen framed on a bad rap and about to be packed off to ""MS One."" That would be Maximum Security One as in so secure that the prison is located in outer space and the prisoners are obliged to serve their sentence in a state of ""stasis."" In short theyre put to sleep - a condition that threatens to prove contagious here. It happens that the Presidents daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) is visiting MS One on a fact-finding mission there to investigate rumours the slumbering inmates are being used as guinea pigs in nasty medical experiments. Oops she inadvertently awakens a sleeping ugly an especially brutish lad with a scarred eye and a thick Scottish burr. In turn he wakes up his even more brutal brother and so on until the cons are in full revolt and Emilie is their prize hostage. Naturally only Snow can save her. Thus in return for his freedom he rockets off into the black yonder occasionally pausing just long enough to discharge a few bits and bytes of that cynical banter. To this point Irish co-directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger no doubt excited by their feature debut are doing their level best to pretend that the script is indeed derived as the credits proudly insist ""from an original idea"" by Luc Besson. Alas since Luc surely knows better as do we that pretence is hard to maintain. The action sequences a stale amalgam of noise and clutter dont help the cause. Nor do the not-very-special effects although a free fall in space suits a re-entry plunge from that orbiting jail all the way down to mother Earth definitely captures our attention if only by so flagrantly defying all logic. Actually some help finally arrives and to their everlasting credit the cast provides it. Two in particular. With that dead eye and live accent Joseph Gilgun puts a deliciously scary face on the villainous punk - think Begbie from Trainspotting but wired even tighter and partying like its 2079. And Pearce pumps a surprising amount of levity into his one-liners - sure its still hot air but at least the banter comes fully inflated. Grace fares less well with Emilie although it must be said that in sheer blandness her Presidents daughter does make for a convincing Presidents daughter - Chelsea Clinton maybe with a hint of Julie Nixon. In the end Lockout is just another minor flick guilty of that most common aesthetic crime borrowing too much and repaying too little. A stern judge would probably toss it in debtors prison but there may not be any room.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 2079 a secret agent infiltrates a high-security space-prison. BOTTOM LINE A creaky old script dressed in futuristic space-garb. Even by trash-cinema standards this is pretty bad. CAST Guy Pearce Maggie Grace Joseph Gilgun. LENGTH 135 The year is 2079 but some things havent gone out of style according to the sci-fi action flick ""Lockout."" Secret agents still lug around metal briefcases they still hide things in low-tech train-station lockers and they still calm their nerves by having a smoke. Apparently even Zippo is still in business. These are sure signs that the makers of ""Lockout"" werent paying close attention when they reworked their antiquated script into a futuristic space-prison movie. Thats too bad because ""Lockout"" has an appealing lead in Guy Pearce whose tightly coiled intensity worked so well in ""Memento"" and its producer and co-writer is Luc Besson the French king of the cheap thrill (""The Transporter"" ""Taken""). But theres cheap and then theres this rip-off. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Pearce plays Snow the usual ex-operative whos so tough that he cracks jokes while taking a beating ""I guess thats why they call it a punch line."" Snow is infiltrating a maximum-security space station (where Joseph Gilgun livens things up as a psychotic convict) to rescue a hostage named Emily (Maggie Grace of ""Taken"") who happens to be the presidents daughter. Emily turns out to be Snows equal in the lousy one-liner department. Her best comeback ""Are you always this obnoxious?"" ""Lockout"" might have gotten by if it displayed a little creativity but writer-directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather cant even reach basic believability. Its one thing to stage a prison riot and forget to include any guards. But hurling characters through space down to Earth -- with nothing but parachutes -- does not pass the laugh test. From the overall story to the niggling details nearly everything in this ostensibly high-tech movie feels hopelessly outmoded. Would you believe that in 2079 cops still show up to interrogation rooms holding paper cups of coffee? Even Java Jacket is still in business.

Guy Pearce right and Maggie Grace appear in a scene from ""Lockout."" Photo Open Road Films Lockout review Rescue mission to outer space 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lockout Action drama. Starring Guy Pearce and Maggie Grace. Directed by James Mather and Stephen Saint Leger. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Luc Besson knows what hes doing. When he gets a good idea for a movie - for example ""The Lady"" which also opens Friday - he directs it himself. But when he gets an idea like the one for ""Lockout"" about a tough guy in 2079 who has to rescue the presidents daughter from an outer-space prison he delegates the authority. So Besson conceived ""Lockout"" and wrote part of the screenplay but the ones who actually got their hands dirty on this one were directors James Mather and Stephen Saint Leger. Like ""Taken"" another action film derived from a Besson idea ""Lookout"" tells the story of a young woman (once again its Maggie Grace) being held prisoner. But where ""Taken"" had the great advantage of a fathers need to save his own daughter and of Liam Neeson in vengeance mode the relationships in ""Lockout"" are lukewarm. Our hero doesnt care if he rescues her and the audience doesnt much care either. At one point its even uncertain whether her being rescued is good for the country. This sort of muddled focus in a screenplay - not to be confused for complexity - is a hallmark of faulty story construction. Yet most of the time ""Lockout"" is pleasant enough not something to recommend to a friend but enjoyable in the moment. Guy Pearce has a lot to do with that as the most impervious action star imaginable. At the start of the film he is tied to a chair and being interrogated by a government official. Every time he is asked a question he makes a wisecrack and gets punched in the face. This happens about a half dozen times and to the screenwriters credit every single wisecrack is funny. Later when offered the assignment of saving the presidents daughter he answers ""Id rather castrate myself with blunt rocks."" Could Noel Coward ever write repartee like that? I think not. Pearce stays funny throughout but ""Lockout"" itself isnt funny and perhaps it should have been. The movie never bogs down and the filmmakers arent self-important enough to overstay their welcome. But as is inevitable with a movie like this - that is one stuck on a spaceship and with nothing worth pursuing in terms of relationships - the action piles on and acquires a sameness. Too much of ""Lockout"" consists of Pearce and Grace running through a dim corridor with people shooting at them. Spoiler alert They keep missing.

"Movie review Lockout - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-LockoutMovie review LockoutGuy Pearce stars in the futuristic Lockout in which he tries to rescue the presidents daughter from inmates in a prison in space. The film has a lot of action and one-liners but is pretty weightless.April 12 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ex-secret agent Guy Pearce must rescue Maggie Grace from a prison in space... (FilmDistrict FilmDistrict )""Lockout"" is about a troubled prison in space starring Guy Pearce as an ex-secret agent all muscled up and throwing as many one-liners as punches. The mission is improbable the films logic loosey-goosey and there are many explosive shortcuts a as in if it doesnt make sense just blow it up big time and maybe the audience wont notice. Ah but they will. The film is based on an idea from espionage/action specialist Luc Besson whose interest in the genre seems to know no bounds a writing directing producing sometimes merely thinking. Some of that inspiration and execution is better than others a ""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Taken"" fall into the better category a with Besson directing only a few of his brainstorms. He turned over ""Lockout"" to up-and-coming Irish filmmakers James Mather and Stephen Saint-Leger known primarily for the low-budget sci-fi wizardry of ""Prey Alone"" a short they wrote and directed that created an Internet stir. ""Lockout"" marks their feature film writing/directing debut and for all of its rough edges and dead-ends there are still flashes of that indefinable quality a promise? talent? a that makes you hope they get other chances to try for more top-to-bottom polish and panache. The movie is set some 60-plus years in the future but a lot of things remain the same. Pearce is Agent Snow. Make that ex-agent since he discovered some double-crossing in a CIA-like operation a but instead of getting a promotion he ended up doing jail time for murder. ""Lockout"" opens as agency investigators are trying to beat him into revealing where to find a briefcase that holds some state secrets. But it only serves to bloody his face strengthen his resolve and sharpen his comic timing. Meanwhile Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) is the U.S. presidents do-gooding daughter who is dressed to the nines to tour the maximum-security prison orbiting not too far from an international space station. Her aim is to interview the inmates who serve most of their sentence in stasis a a medically induced sleep state a and shes looking into rumors that it has well drawbacks early dementia among them. After some bonehead moves by the Secret Service agent attached to guard her all hell and most of the prisoners break loose and you guessed it theres only one man who can infiltrate the place and get her back safely. But it wont be easy because in addition to the trillion-mile shuttle trip the bulky spacesuits and the prison mayhem Snow and Emilie turn out to be like oil and water. So basically nothing you havent seen before. With the inmates taking over the asylum lots of hidden agendas opposites out there attracting and some pretty impressive pyrotechnics and high-risk stunts the filmmakers had a lot to work with. But they only get about halfway there and despite the jeopardy at every turn your palms never sweat. Still the filmmakers inventiveness with special effects and action which landed them this job gives the film a good deal of visual punch. As Snow and Emilie try to outwit the most lethal gang of inmates they seem to face a firefight around every corner and the slick high-tech lines of the spaceship are a perfect backdrop for the shootouts. It is entertaining to see Pearce try his hand at laid-back and laconic since hes often tightly wound and slightly tortured (""Memento"" comes to mind). And Lennie James as Shaw the one agent in Snows corner is excellent in this very solid ensemble. But mostly ""Lockout"" is lost in space. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Caesar Must Die is Shakespeare like youve never...February 22 2013Wanted New Home for Brazilian Drug KingpinMarch 28 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTLockoutMaximum Security PrisonGuy PearceCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-lockout-20120413,0,3923091.story",200,lockout9,lockout,latimes

Directed by feature-film newcomers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger who co-wrote the script Lockout wants to be Aliens 3-meets-Die Hard. But it doesnt muster the tension or energy to come within a galaxy of either. VIDEO Pearce packs a punch in futuristic LockoutThe film is set in 2079. Pearce plays Snow an ex-CIA super-operative framed for the murder of his partner. Hes sentenced to 30 years on MS One a prison orbiting Earth.The premise -- that prisoners are induced into comas to keep them docile -- is promising. The cast including Pearce Maggie Grace and Coen brothers favorite Peter Stormare is enough to anchor any picture.About the movieLockout 1/2 out of fourStars Guy Pearce Maggie Grace Peter Stormare Director James Mather Stephen St. LegerDistributor FilmDistrict Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and language including some sexual references. Running time 1 hour 35 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBut there is no overcoming this mess of a plot which calls for Emilie (Grace) the presidents daughter to lead an investigation of abuses on MS One. It doesnt take long (or much) for a prisoner to break free kidnap Emilie and unfreeze hundreds of inmates.No need for the military or police. This job requires one man Snow whose first name is kept secret until the films end perhaps for dramatic tension.There isnt much else to keep you guessing except trying to figure out the actors motives. Pearce who made a career out of retrospective heroes must have wanted to play an action hero. And he beefs up well.But his one-liners often uttered through a cigarette or gum can be laughably clunky. If he isnt dropping cliched lines hes the subject of them ""Hes the best there is"" one agent says. ""But hes a loose cannon."" The villains are fine led by Vincent Regan and Joe Gilgun. Theres also a funny visual joke involving Snow his cigarette and an interrogation.But none of this is worth the time.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 12 2012 228 PM Title Lockout Film Info With Guy Pearce. A convict must save the Presidents daughter from a futuristic prison. Directors James Mather Stephen St. Leger (135). PG-13 Violence language. At area theaters. This blatant ripoff of ""Escape From New York"" comes via writer-producer Luc Besson who directed this weeks less bombastic ""The Lady."" Here in a gritty future wisecracking tough guy Marion Snow (a tattooed affected Guy Pearce) is framed for murder and about to be put into ""stasis"" -- that is a frozen slumber on an orbiting space station prison reserved for deadly convicts. But then the Presidents daughter (Maggie Grace) is stranded on the prison during a humanitarian visit and Snow is sent to get her out and away from hundreds of defrosted angry demented prisoners who still use phrases like ""tough as a Sherman tank"" as the 22nd century approaches. Directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger stage a few good action set pieces but unlike the 1981 midnight movie classic it imitates the blandly titled ""Lockout"" never busts out of its cheesy concept. And Pearces Snow for all of his I-hate-this-stuff swagger is no Snake Plissken. Even his name is weak. Go ahead -- call him ""Marion.""

Actually hes not just some guy hes ex-CIA agent Snow - Guy Pearce doing his best Bogart tough-guy act spitting out snappy one-liners every time he gets whomped. More about Lockout >> But Snow isnt long for D.C. or even long for planet Earth. In Lockout a breakneck B-movie that borrows from Blade Runner Die Hard and Escape from New York (to name a few) our abs-flexing hero has been framed for the murder of his ex-partner. Hes sentenced to 30 years of ""stasis"" - deep sleep - on MS One a maximum security penitentiary floating in space. But as luck would have it - bad luck good luck take your pick - the First Daughter Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) is also on MS One on a humanitarian mission to see how the prison station is treating its guests. One of the convicts - a tattooed toothless psycho (Joseph Gilgun) - is awakened from his beauty sleep to be interviewed by Emilie. Next thing you know he has a gun he has the girl and he has his finger on the button that lets loose every prisoner in the place. And so Snow is dispatched to MS One - not to do time but to rescue the presidents daughter. And to crack wise within an inch of his life. Lockout hails from French film wizard Luc Besson (he cowrote the screenplay and produces) and director newbies Stephen Saint Leger and James Mather a pair of Irish lads who came to Bessons attention via a series of action-packed shorts (including one about an agent on the hunt for a fugitive in a military prison). The duo deploy big clanking sets and a modest arsenal of computer visual effects to evoke a cold cruel orbiting jail. Lockout is genre all the way. The film wears its colors proudly but it also alas wears out its welcome. Pearce maintains an amusingly imperturbable attitude throughout while Grace - the object of Liam Neesons rescuing in Taken - does her best to project feisty independence in the damsel-in-distress role. Gilgun is so over-the-top violent and virulent that he ceases to be menacing Vincent Regan plays his more sensible sibling a nonetheless malevolent force and various thugs and mugs run amok. Momentum-wise the action rocks on but near the midway mark a kind of creative fatigue sets in - not that things were terribly creative to begin with.

"Lockout movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Lockout Space prison mayhem both vicious and silly ?April 12 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDeep space isnt big enough to contain Guy Pearce his impudent lock-jawed smirk and the deliriously cruddy ""Lockout"" set in 2079 a time when Zippo lighters will still be used with impunity because who doesnt like that snappy click they make when you flick the lid open or shut?Pearce plays Snow an ex-CIA operative strong-armed into a trip to a space station prison where 500 of Earths most venal criminals are doing time in ""stasis"" or an artificially induced form of deep sleep. The aftereffects of stasis include dementia and psychosis. The aftereffects of watching ""Lockout"" include an inability to focus or to complete a simple declarative sentence without an ill-timed cutaway in the middle.Snow is forced to travel to MS One because theres a mutiny on board and the convicts are running around killing people and the presidents daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) is up there on a fact-finding mission and needs rescuing.Filmed in Serbia by the Irish team of James Mather and Stephen Saint-Leger ""Lockout"" features a great deal of point-blank handgun killings with the moments of impact elided just enough to retain a dubious PG-13 rating. Fantastic. The documentary ""Bully"" gets slapped initially with an R rating before wheedling its way down to aPG-13 after trimming three bad words and this thing has no problem securing a PG-13?The leaders of the prison mutiny are a couple of ruthless Scots played by Vincent Regan and Joe ""Travis Bickle Glasgow Division"" Gilgun. This being a Luc Besson production the simplicity of the story concept (from as the credits say ""an original idea by Luc Besson"" -- well an idea anyway) guides the show. The pacing is relentless and monotonous. The editing by Eamonn Power and Camille Delamarre appears to have been handled while running from one gate to another in an airport somewhere. Half the time you dont know how a character got where hes supposed to be; a quick shot of Snow hanging on to the outside of the space station comes out of nowhere and then three more people get shot in the head. The climactic space jump ending in a drab section of urban freeway somewhere in Serbia is so spatially and rhythmically off its as if the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" guys paid Besson to shoot the sequence that way for heckling purposes.mjphillipstribune.comLockout -- 1 starMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action and language including some sexual references)Running time 135Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesCity Renews Pact For Union StationNovember 20 1996Craig Wasson Does Hard Time On `Deep Space NineApril 5 1996Joliet Cops Eager For New HomeNovember 14 1997`L5 Offers A Visually Stunning Look At FutureOctober 13 1996Find More Stories AboutLockoutTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0411-lockout-20120412,0,5285414.column",200,lockout15,lockout,chicagotribune
"Lockout | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lockout ) Lockout (France 2012) April 12 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Lockout is painful. Not painful in the way Uwe Boll or Sex and the City movies are painful. But painful enough that I kept waiting for Nicolas Cage to show up. Or Katherine Heigl. Or god forbid both. Instead however we have Guy Pearce and Maggie Grace picking up paychecks. Luc Bessons name is attached but that has never been indicative of quality. Besson likes making Hollywood-type movies. That means loud flashy and dumb - three adjectives that would apply here if the filmmaking (by directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger) wasnt so inept. The premise would seem to be of the cant-miss variety cribbed from Escape from New York which is the subject of constant remake rumors. It says a lot about how poor the execution is that the cant-miss misses. Lockout takes forever to get going stumbles through the action-centric main chapter then ends with a brief third act that is chaotic rushed and ultimately unsatisfying. When it was over I felt like half the movie was missing. The average Michael Bay movie has more heart than Lockout; the only thing this has going for it over a Transformers movie is that its mercifully short. Thats worth something I guess. The story is set in 2079 when all the expected futuristic hardware is in use air cars commercial satellite transportation prison space ships etc. (Cell phones havent advanced much though - everyone seems to use an iPhone or iPhone clone.) This iteration of the late 21st century looks like a mashup of Blade Runner and The Jetsons. The bare bones plot has the Presidents prissy do-gooder daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) abducted while visiting MS-1 a maximum security prison in geosynchronous orbit where the cryogenically frozen psycho prisoners are waking up. To escape a frame-up ex-CIA operative Snow (Guy Pearce) is shuttled up to the prison on a rescue mission. As a nice coincidence the only man who can clear Snow of the fraudulent charges happens to be an inmate on MS-1. Of course the operation is complicated by the head of the Secret Service Langral (Peter Stormore) who would be delighted to see Snow fall. Theres no reason this hairbrained plot couldnt be made into a rip-roarin action film like Die Hard on a Space Ship. Unfortunately the crew behind Lockout doesnt have a clue how to generate suspense or excitement. Theres a lot of running around but little in the way of action to quicken the pulse. The anti-gravity bit might have been moderately entertaining if we hadnt already seen it almost shot-for-shot in Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Theres no big showdown with the bad guys; the sequences in the prison ship end in an anticlimax but thats only a prelude to worse things to come. The ending which attempts to wrap up as many loose ends as possible straddles the line between ugly mess and unmitigated disaster. Even those willing to forgive Lockouts lackluster action are likely to throw up their hands in disgust at the abrupt contrived way everything is brought to a conclusion. There are issues with the characters as well. Both are boring in their own ways. Emilie has little in the way of a personality and exists primarily to do dumb things to prolong the running length. She belongs in a horror movie. Snow is a clichA(c)d misanthrope with a heart of gold - your basic Han Solo without the charm. Hes more annoying than interesting more grating than appealing. The problem with Snow isnt Pearce who can scowl and spit out sarcastic one-liners with the best of them; its the way the screenwriters have penned the character. The problem with Emilie may be Grace. This is not a winning performance. It appears that a fair amount of money was spent on the special effects (although not enough) indicating that whoever controlled the purse-strings had seen Transformers and come to the reasonable conclusion that for cinematic science fiction stupidity is a quality prized above all others. There are some nifty futuristic shots and some nice model and/or CGI (hard to tell) work but the visuals are inconsistent. 3-D has been rejected in favor of 2-D - thats always a plus. Pretty images aside Lockout might well be intended as a one-word description for what happens to viewers who attempt to become involved in the diluted by-the-numbers action.

She also happens to be on a humanitarian mission to study prisoner conditions in an experimental penal colony when shes caught in the midst of a violent jailhouse riot. In outer space. With no thriller cliche left unused the gaily outlandish plot is matched by tin-eared dialogue ripe tough-guy overacting from the very game Pearce and best-that-she-could acting from Grace. For good measure Peter Stormare rumbles through as a generic government heavy. What could be fun though is just a big hunk of cheese -- fromage really since its a French production from Euro-schlock fancier Luc Besson -- and not nearly the clever idiocy it should be. Irish directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger who co-wrote the screenplay with Besson are just off enough in their tonal calculations to make each scene a little slacker and clumsier than it ought to be to pull off this kind of gulp-and-toss entertainment. Too serious to be a parody and too stupid to be a viable action pic Lockout floats like space junk in the final frontier.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For years after Die Hard set the template for modern action movies--predominantly single location pitting tough and often irreverent loose cannon against a pack of sneering Euro-terrorists or gangsters--the ""Die Hard in a"" subgenre thrived on a plane (Air Force One) a boat (Under Siege) and a hockey rink (Sudden Death) before the related ""Speed but with a"" sub-subgenre took over and Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich drove an ice-cream truck into cinema history. Though a hat-tip is owed to John Carpenters Escape From New York the Die Hard-in-a-prison-floating-in-outer-space thriller Lockout is a pleasingly ridiculous throwback to that tradition co-written by producer Luc Besson who knows his way around a quality knockoff. Replace the sneering Euro-terrorists with prison insurrectionists add the presidents daughter as the damsel-in-distress and the script is just a few zingers away from writing itself. Donning a T-shirt that reads ""Warning Offensive"" Guy Pearce stars as a government agent who in action terms plays by his own rules--or at least the rules of Harrison Ford as Han Solo or Kurt Russell as John Wayne as Snake Plissken. A reluctant hero of the cynical wisecracking kind Pearce stands falsely accused of conspiracy to commit espionage but a revolt at a Supermax prison in outer space gives him an opportunity to redeem himself. Because the outer-space-prison hook isnt pulpy enough the powers-that-be send Pearce on a mission to rescue the daughter-in-chief (Maggie Grace) an entitled yet feisty Princess Leia-type who the prisoners are holding for ransom. Everything about Lockout is patently absurd starting with a facility so costly and inefficient that it might as well have sharks in astronaut helmets patrolling the perimeter. Pearces directive is also far-fetched because it requires him to break into the prison dodge a gauntlet of rebel thugs and inmates off their meds slip away with a high-value hostage and break for the nearest pod out of there. But Besson and his writer-director team James Mather and Stephen St. Leger are comfortable with the ""impossible"" side of their mission impossible. They humbly suggest the audience keep its disbelief suspended like Neil Armstrongs sack. More than any masculine heroics Pearces primary job is maintaining the tone smug irreverent and giddily punch-drunk.

In addition it deftliieny has more heart more likeable characters? and it ultimately feels less manipulative than Twilight. Plus it has better direction especially in regards to action sequences compared to Twilight. Maybe Twilight wouldve been good if Sofia Coppola signed on like she was supposed to.

Cast Guy Pearce Maggie Grace Peter Stormare. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and language including some sexual references. You can skydive from a space station. You can revive people who died from a lack of oxygen by stabbing a needle full of ... something ... into their eye and rooting around till you hit whatever youre supposed to hit that brings them back to life. Motor oil toilet water and a little cigarette ash make an excellent hair dye. You can skydive from a space station Im sorry. Movies like this are supposed to be ridiculous on some level. Its part of the fun. But dang. Falling through space popping your parachute and landing on the one empty stretch of freeway in some bustling future city? Cmon. We all have our limits. Top 10 movies set in space Interview Guy Pearce There are things to admire after a fashion about ""Lockout"" a film set in 2079 thats directed by James Mather and Stephen St. Leger who wrote the script along with Luc Besson. Guy Pearce would be chief among those things to admire. He plays Snow a smart-aleck former government agent who has been set up to take the inevitable fall for some crime. We meet him as he is being pummeled during questioning rattling off glib answers to the question of how one of his friends a fellow agent wound up being killed. Without a trial thanks to the efforts of government muckety-muck Langral (Peter Stormare) hes convicted and sentenced to MS One a maximum-security prison in space. Meanwhile Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) is on the way to -- yes -- MS One on a fact-finding mission to determine whether the inmates are harmed being put into a sort of cryogenic state. Oh also Shes the daughter of the president of the United States (Peter Hudson). Once Emilie arrives a riot takes place and soon the entire prison is under the control of inmate Alex (Vincent Regan) and his psycho brother Hydell (Joseph Gilgun). Snow is offered a deal Go to MS One and save Emilie or go to prison himself. (""Escape From New York"" comparisons are doubtless welcome at this point.) Off he goes and once he finds her he learns that she isnt going to be the grateful damsel in distress he might have figured. They spar while trying to avoid the bad guys and find a way home. Although there are some amusing moments along the way with Pearce cracking wise as he cracks heads the whole thing seems disjointed. Among other problems a final epic confrontation -- a requirement for these sorts of movies -- is avoided making the resolution while ludicrous also anticlimactic. (One plus Future medical treatment heals crippling wounds in a jiffy so theres no pesky limping around while trying to outrun villains. Handy that.) Back on Earth a more-traditional mystery unfolds sort of -- it doesnt really make any more sense than the story that takes place in space maybe even less. But truly even with an actor as smart as Pearce romping around in it this isnt the kind of movie for which making sense is required. He seems to be having a grand old time but with gaping plot holes and ridiculous developments the feeling is not contagious. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

If a futuristic space prison with 500 of the worlds most violent and dangerous criminals cryogenically frozen was to somehow undergo an inmate revolt who would emerge as the unquestioned leader of such an intergalactic gang of gruesome murders?Why the Scots of course.At least thats according to the sci-fi circa 2079 action flick ""Lockout"" directed by a pair of Irish filmmakers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger. They co-wrote it with producer Luc Besson the prodigious if seldom proficient French action filmmaker.The MS One is a hulking orbiting jail that puts its prisoners in ""stasis"" or a deep sleep. (And you thought incarceration costs are high now?) But while the presidents daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) visits MS One to question its methods a prisoner easily gets loose and soon the ship is overrun by criminals who immediately fall in line behind the Scottish Alex (Vincent Regan) and his more psychotic sibling Hydell (Joe Gilgun).Two secret service men take charge of the hostage rescue -- the hawkish Langral (played by the always interesting Peter Stormare whose odd Swedish rhythms made him a Coen brothers favorite) and the more measured Shaw (Lennie James).Obviously such awkward circumstances can only be resolved by a solo heroic mission from a reluctant irascible protagonist. Ours is Snow (Guy Pearce) an agent who has been unjustly deemed a criminal after a mission gone wrong but is given the chance to win his freedom by saving the presidents daughter.Hes seemingly the last person left in a grim briefly glimpsed industrialized world (the Oval Office has been lowered into a bunker) who still smokes and carries a Zippo. Clad in a T-shirt that reads ""Warning Offensive"" he speaks almost entirely in sarcastic one-liners. We first see him taking a brutal interrogation beating and explaining his whereabouts to Langral as busy ""trampolining your wife.""Though few of these lines land Snows relentless tongue-in-cheek patter has a mounting effect like an annoying TV ad campaign. This is a brawnier Pearce (""L.A. Confidential"" ""Mildred Pierce"") and if ""Lockout"" is meant as an action hero audition he certainly has the needed charisma.Hes the only reason to see ""Lockout"" along with Grace who has an easy chemistry with Pearce. They spend much of the film bantering competitively while navigating the corridors of the MS One a labyrinth of ""Star Wars""-like hallways. (Just what is our fascination with horizontally closing ""blast doors"" that makes us so certain this is the future of doorways?)The cheap visual effects are so bad that youll be wondering if you misplaced your 3-D glasses. But no the digital backgrounds of some scenes really are that undefined the kind of work video game makers would scoff at.Such deficiencies could and perhaps should be overlooked when it comes to B-movies whose electricity are ideally fueled from raw immediacy rather than deep budgets. But in the case of ""Lockout"" the cheapness only reinforces the overall slipshoddiness and lack of inventiveness.Its of a piece with the rest of ""Lockout"" cavalierly conceived generically titled and derivatively plotted. It feels like a missed chance because Pearce and Grace came ready to play.""Lockout"" a Film District release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and language including some sexual references.

(Todays action heroes have to speak too much dialogue and love kids.) Mementos Guy Pearce on something of a roll following his peevish Monty in HBOs Mildred Pierce is our taciturn hero Snow an ex-CIA operative living in a dingy future. Having been set up for a crime he didnt commit Snow is bound for an outer-space prison where coincidentally the Presidents adult daughter (Maggie Grace) is visiting. Things get scarily out of hand in orbit the inmates run wild and Snows got to rise to the stature of Escape from New Yorks Snake Plissken in a hurry. Some of the digital effects have a regrettable cheesiness about them (Frances Luc Besson is a producer and writer) and there are a few unintentional laughs involving cryogenic freezing. But where else are you going to find terse Hawksian flirtation and--that perennial chestnut--a foreign-accented baddie (wiry Joseph Gilgun as a deranged inmate)? These were once pleasures enough; they still are for those who can leave behind the yammering.

The only man who can extract Emilie from this peril is in the bad graces and custody of national security--but wrongly accused agent Snow (Guy Pearce) agrees to the suicide mission since the only person who can clear his name is also on MS One. The committee product of newbie directors James Mather Stephen St. Leger and producer Luc Besson Lockout is not unexpectedly a potluck of derivative references. Among the recognizable 80s-actioner tropes the ""maverick whos the only man for an official suicide mission"" premise exemplified in Escape From New York; Snows wisecracking under pressure tossing asides to the audience in self-amused Bruce Willis fashion; the on-the-run odd coupling of the first daughter and the sullied Snow in which each finds the other is more than what they seem. Such scavenging might be overlooked if the action were legible the one-liners crisply written or the chemistry of the leads bonding. As is Lockouts dystopian future of expendable lives comments principally on a dystopian present of expendable entertainment.

TWITTER Directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather fill the films obvious narrative gaps with enough witty banter and tongue-in-cheek humor for audiences to overlook the subpar special effects used throughout. Guy Pearce reveals impressively bulging biceps and the deadpan delivery of a Borscht Belt comic in Lockout the new sci-fi actioner in which his character cracks more jokes than he does heads. This low-budget effort produced and co-written by genre specialist Luc Besson compensates for its cheesy special effects and production values as well as its utter derivativeness with redeeming doses of tongue-in-cheek humor. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus Clearly inspired by John Carpenters Escape from New York as well as borrowing a significant plot element from its L.A.-set sequel the film takes place in the year 2079. It begins with its hero Snow (Pearce) -- one name is much cooler than two in this sort of film -- getting beaten to a pulp by a government agent (a glowering Peter Stormare) while responding to each blow with an insouciant wisecrack. It seems that Snow a former agent himself has been falsely accused of a crime and is about to be sent off to begin a 30-year sentence at MS-1 a maximum-security prison in outer space. But when the hundreds of convicts suddenly wake up from their cryogenic state and take hostages including the presidents daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) Snow is offered his freedom in return for a solo rescue mission. There are more complicated aspects to the plot -- the prison is also home to the one man who knows the whereabouts of a mysterious briefcase than can prove Snows innocence -- but theyre handled with such indifference by directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather who co-wrote the screenplay with Besson that theyre hardly worth relating. VIDEO Lockout First 5 Minutes of Sci-Fi Thriller Starring Guy Pearce Released Landing on the orbiting prison which resembles a 50s era North Korean factory Snow quickly finds himself battling the jumpsuit-wearing bad guys led by the erudite Alex (Vincent Regan) and his psychotic brother (Joseph Gilgun) who besides engaging in horrific acts of violence speaks with such a thick Scottish brogue that subtitles would have been helpful. Indeed the prisoners include a strange preponderance of Brits which makes one wonder about the demographics of futuristic America. When Snow finally encounters Emilie shes near dead from lack of oxygen and hes forced to revive her with a hypodermic needle to her eye. Unfortunately for him she proves to be the sort of feisty dame who doesnt easily cooperate with even a would-be rescuer so the two are quickly trading insults even while fending off numerous attackers. The action setpieces -- including a motorcycle chase so heavily dependent on ineffective CGI effects that it looks like a decades-old video game -- are ultimately far less memorable than the devil-may-care one-liners so breezily tossed off by Pearce. Resembling a two-eyed version of Kurt Russells Snake Plissken the actor seems to be having a good time even as hes no doubt contemplating the films franchise prospects.

""Lockout"" the latest Besson producing effort falls into the latter category but doesnt go down quietly. Casting Guy Pearce as a shockingly derivative tough guy lead directors Stephen St. Leger and James Mather deliver an overly familiar barrage of dystopian imagery assaultive action choreography and other vapid devices that have a distinctly Bessonian quality. Besson shares a screenwriting credit with the directors and conceived of the original idea which isnt saying much except that he owns this joint. In both premise and execution ""Lockout"" combines elements of Bessons ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Escape from New York"" clinging to those and countless other movies B-movie thrills so faithfully that it at least remains watchably bad. The filmmakers know the kind of movie they want to make a rowdy space action-adventure with a proto-John Wayne anti-hero gunning his way through hordes of baddies and trading barbs with the damsel in distress hes assigned to rescue. That would be Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) the daughter of the president on this near-future Earth where much of the grimier aspects of society-most notably prisons-have been relegated to orbit. Its here that requisite badass Snow (Pearce) arrested for a crime of espionage he didnt commit gets a chance for redemption by infiltrating a prison colony gone amuck. Snow establishes his hard ball credentials in the movies clever first shot which has him barely flinching from repeated punches to the face over the course of a vain interrogation session by a less humorous cop (Peter Stormare) for the aforementioned crime. Pearce humorously eggs on his captors the credits cropping up each time he recoils from another blow illustrating the combination of smarmy one-liners and brawn that follows. Its the most coherent viscerally satisfying moment in the entire picture. Flashbacks explain that the confusion of events involved a close set of negotiations for the mysterious contents of a suitcase (a nod perhaps to Robert Aldrichs great apocalyptic thriller ""Kiss Me Deadly"" also referenced in ""Pulp Fiction""). Snow protects the contested object from a set of gun-wielding goons with the help of right hand man Mace (Tim Plester) and some cunning motorcycle skills demonstrated over the course of a speedy highway chase scene rendered in a blurry hyper-digitized single take. Once the suitcase is hidden within the confines of a vault it promptly drops out of the plot for the bulk of the running time as the hostage scenario takes charge. From a purely technical standpoint ""Lockout"" consists of disciplined action pastiche but much of its thundering engine borrows from better movies. The filmmakers frame the material in a typical routine of shooting and screaming that diminishes its more engaging qualities decent CGI of hulking space crafts and a committed self-deprecating turn by Pearce chief among them. But the villains and the predicament they create never keep pace. The revolting prisoners take orders from a vicious ringleader (Vincent Regan) who lumbers about and grunts demands into the ships ubiquitous cameras while his equally nefarious sibling (Joseph Gilgun) chuckles in the background and scores of American officials watch dumbstruck from the planet below. Theres a near-reflex state of fatigue emanating from this scenario; rather than offering the hint of deja vu ""Lockout"" encourages viewers to shrug at the blatant sense that they have seen better. Mostly set on a drab prison ship filled with metallic walls and elevators the minimalist set-up calls to mind a superior space western that looks downright subtle by modern blockbuster standards the 1981 Sean Connery vehicle ""Outland"" a serviceable ""High Noon"" update that finds Connery facing down hordes of baddies on a lonely space colony. The earlier movie has a restraint virtually absent from ""Lockout"" although the new work gets away with general clumsiness precisely because movies like ""Outland"" and ""Escape from New York"" laid the groundwork. Both ""Outland"" and ""Escape from New York"" date back to 1981 a decisive moment in the history of the modern blockbuster when the ripple effects of ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars"" birthed a new standard for studio tentpoles. Since then said tentpoles have grown bigger louder and more erratic in ways that dwarf their Reagan-era precedents. Comparing ""Lockout"" with the earlier movies reveals Bessons stylistic tendencies as little more than imitations of better works. For everything excessive about ""Lockout"" the only trick it lacks is a sense of imagination. As a director Besson has made a few strong movies (""Angel A"" being the last example) and plenty of forgettable ones (unless Im missing something and ""Arthur 3"" which I did not see deserves special consideration). However while Besson doesnt direct ""Lockout"" his authorship pervades the work which isnt really directed at all so much as assembled out of a patchwork of gruff confrontations and loud jarring noises. From the moment Bessons name appears onscreen the movie belongs to his brand and testifies to its diminishing returns. Criticwire grade C- HOW WILL IT PLAY? FilmDistrict releases ""Lockout"" this Friday where it may attract some interest among Besson and Pearce fans but most of the genre crowd is more likely to check out ""Cabin in the Woods"" whereas the mainstream popularity of ""The Hunger Games"" will also threaten its returns. This is one for the VOD/DVD market more than anything else.

A mass breakout at an outer-space Alcatraz yields a few cheap thrills and an amusing leading-man showcase for Guy Pearce in ""Lockout."" Tossing off cynical one-liners like a spacewalking Sam Spade Pearce sets the pace and tone for this quick-and-dirty offering from Luc Bessons Europacorp factory which tackles a nifty futuristic premise with bargain-basement efficiency and a deadpan devil-may-care attitude. Its an initially invigorating tactic that proves slapdash and unsatisfying over the long haul reducing a potentially rich sci-fier to the level of a halfway decent time-killer that should enjoy a brief but profitable B.O. voyage. Working from a script they wrote with Besson debuting helmers Stephen Saint Leger and James Mather establish a darkly playful mood from their opening shot of hard-boiled ex-CIA operative Snow (Pearce) getting punched in the face by a government heavy. Its the year 2079 and Snow framed for the murder of his old partner is sentenced to 30 years on MS One a maximum-security prison hovering in orbit. But Snows sentence turns into a rescue mission when Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) a humanitarian worker investigating reports of inmate abuse aboard MS One inadvertently triggers a prisoner uprising and is taken hostage. Complicating matters further Emilies father happens to be the president of the United States a development that calls for a reluctant Snow to infiltrate the spacecraft beat up a bunch of uglies in orange jumpsuits and get the first daughter out of harms way before the government blows the prison higher than sky-high. In short the setup is basically ""Escape From New York"" in space and in its swift mechanical execution ""Lockout"" lives up to that intriguing but derivative logline. Theres a pleasing single-mindedness to the way the script gets down to brass tacks initially; the exposition is minimal the key details lightly tossed off as the story maneuvers from twisty neo-noir to cut-rate space opera. Absent the lavish spectacle or weighty subtext typical of much speculative fiction the pic compensates for its lack of heft or texture with a few inventively nasty setpieces as well as a pair of memorable lead villains among the inmates played by Vincent Regan and a particularly skin-crawling Joseph Gilgun. Yet the films chief asset and sustaining force is the relentless stream of quips and putdowns that constitutes the bulk of Pearces performance. Rattling off his one-liners with quick-witted panache Pearce not only projects an amusingly world-weary resignation but also signals the viewer that nothing here is meant be taken too seriously. Indeed the performance feels more like a verbal feat than a physical one; refreshing as it is to see this versatile actor caked with grime sweat and blood he isnt allowed to give the sort of satisfying butt-kicking demo that would herald the birth of an action star. Snow spends less time fending off attackers than he does arguing with the headstrong Emilie and while Grace more or less holds her own opposite Pearce their combative tough-guy-meets-tough-girl banter isnt exactly the second coming of Bogart and Bacall. At a certain point the pics unpretentious B-movie style like its generic and uninformative title seems to indicate a simple lack of ambition. Suspense is short-circuited before it can begin to develop; even a cleverly conceived anti-gravity battle sequence is over too quickly to really register a casualty of an editing scheme that tends to abbreviate the moment of impact. The tension goes slack even as the pacing remains relentless and the climactic unraveling of story threads is the result of fairly desultory detective work. The Serbia-shot production reinforces its no-nonsense approach with appropriately grubby visuals; spaceship interiors seem to have been influenced by abandoned warehouses sewer tunnels and gas-station restrooms with windows that offer screensaver-like views of a computer-generated Earth hovering in the background. Longtime d.p. Mather handles lensing duties in functional fashion and the f/x avoid overkill.
