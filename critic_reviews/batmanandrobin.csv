"Holy `Batniks - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Holy `BatniksIts George (pow) Chris (bang) And Alicia (zap) Battling Evil In `Batman amp; Robin The Fourth Big-screen Version Of The Caped Crusaders AdventuresJune 20 1997|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.`Batman amp; Robin"" bat-hype and all turns out to be the fourth and worst of the blockbuster movie series based on Gotham Citys legendary caped comic-book crimefighter. Drowning in money and big-movie effects seething with campy guest supervillains this film somehow lacks snap or surprise humor or real thrills. Its good-looking but oddly lugubrious and disconnected like a fancy dress ball interrupted by explosions and mugging actors.Its enough to drive you batty. Back in the 50s ""Batman"" the comic cost a dime -- as did ""Superman."" And there were few events I looked forward to more as a 10-year-old than the appearance of each new D.C. issue on the stands with the bat-masked sleuth-superhero and his sidekick ""Boy Wonder"" Robin soaring on bat-lines between buildings and through the night skies of Gotham hot in pursuit of crooks and colorful fiends.So why has the movie series begun to pall? With their 100 million budgets and galleries of guest stars the Warner Bros. ""Batman"" movies have been a sure-fire Hollywood franchise series. And ""Batman amp; Robin"" is cunningly constructed to look pretty much like the three others -- even though theres a different Batman (George Clooney replacing Val Kilmer who replaced Michael Keaton for one film) and new villains including John Glover as the contemptible Dr. Jason Woods Uma Thurman as the seductive Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the icy tormented Mr. Freeze.Once again we go through all the motions laid down in the 1989 Tim Burton-directed mega-hit ""Batman."" The villains here are monstrous new crime personalities who have erupted from the wreckage of human lives gone bad (Mr. Freeze is a tragic idealistic scientist Poison Ivy a murdered and resurrected idealistic botanist). Batman and Robin -- and their alter-egos handsome socialite Bruce Wayne and spunky ward Dick Grayson -- battle the baddies and bicker with each other. The fights escalate. The backgrounds grow weirder and more flamboyant.For novelty screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (""Batman amp; Robin"" director Joel Schumachers regular writer on both Schumachers ""Batman"" movies and John Grisham adaptations) throws in a mysterious disease Macgregors Syndrome which afflicts possibly unto death the Wayne mansion butler Alfred. Alfreds niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) pops up from England sporting an unlikely Yank accent and eventually metamorphosing into the feistier chopper-riding Batgirl.Superficially the game is the same as in the previous highly successful three shows. But despite ritzy production design by Barbara Ling a slam-bang spaceship cliffhanger scene a highly amusing villain (Thurmans vampy Ivy) and a good outing from Clooney as Batman -- this movie doesnt ignite.Why do Batmans keep skittering out the Batdoors in this series? Though Schwarzenegger gets top billing playing his first unabashed movie villain since 1984s ""The Terminator"" Clooney does the job with bat-panache. Physically and temperamentally hes probably the best Batman of the series so far. Clooneys physical appearance his regular movie-star good looks (and even his husky voice) conform more closely to the way the character was drawn for the comics and the way readers might have imagined him. His personality more casual than either Keaton in the first two movies and Kilmer in the third gives the part more confidence and a different kind of humor. Clooney and ODonnell also seem less like older and younger brothers than Kilmer and ODonnell.And Goldsman has written Robin as such a rebellious malcontent competitive brat you may sympathize with Bats parenting problems.Good as Clooney is -- sacrificing most of the torment of the earlier ""Batmans"" but gaining charisma -- the movie is like a game thats gone on too long. Schwarzenegger indulges his worst movie vice grandiosely exaggerated comic mugging with every joke telegraphed and underlined. Freeze is a potentially interesting part -- a suffering victim turned monster like Jack Nicholsons Joker (in ""Batman"") or Tommy Lee Jones Two Face (in ""Batman Forever""). But Schwarzenegger pushes the comedy and camp too hard.Thurman on the other hand makes a leggy lewd delight of Poison Ivy. Starting as a nerdy but right-on crusader she then -- after being murdered -- turns into a nightmare of ecological revenge the leafy temptress who can kill you with a kiss who insolently calls Batman and Robin ""Batface and Birdbrain.""You also may wonder why Silverstone though fresh from London acts like a ""Clueless"" Valley girl. Or why Wayne and Albert let her into the house so casually when its obvious she may stumble on a secret identity or two. Batgirl may be slated as permanent Batguest. But couldnt the writers have brought back Michelle Pfeiffers saucy Catwoman instead?1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesNo. 4 `Batman Strikes OutJune 20 1997POW `Batman (and Robin) get a TV Land marathonApril 24 2002Godzilla Is Biting The DustAugust 29 1995Find More Stories AboutPoison IvyBatman amp; RobinTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-06-20/entertainment/9706200277_1_boy-wonder-robin-batman-movies-poison-ivy,200,batmanandrobin1,batmanandrobin,chicagotribune
"WashingtonPost.com Batman amp; Robin Hero Blandwich Go to the ""Batman amp; Robin"" Page Batman amp; Robin Hero Blandwich By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer June 20 1997 George Clooney wears the Batsuit but Arnold Schwarzenegger has top billing in the overwhelmingly bland ""Batman amp; Robin."" Well why not? Like the Nightwings other nemeses Schwarzeneggers Mr. Freeze and his evil cohort Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) invariably upstage him in this fourth fly-by-night adventure. Not that Clooney puts up much of a fight. But then he can hardly move in all that fetishistic body armor. The poor fellow virtually vanishes into the rubber carapace last seen on the tedious Val Kilmer. Indeed the Batsuit seems to grow in size and scope while the characters and story line grow flimsier and more irrelevant. Joel Schumacher who also directed 1995s ""Batman Forever"" provides a series of jokey close-ups of the buff benippled garb as the Dynamic Duo suit up for their initial set-to with Mr. Freeze and his hockey-playing goons. Freeze a cryogenicist whose body temperature was permanently lowered in a lab mishap must live in his own refrigerated armor an elaborate contraption that runs on diamonds. Freeze is in the act of snatching his first rock when Batman and Robin (Chris ODonnell) confront him in the Gotham Museum. In this the first of many protracted frenetically paced action set pieces Batman duels the Fridge while Robin goes after the diamond with the hockey team in pursuit. Clearly no expense was spared but the scene provides all the ka-pow of a drag race between rival Zambonis. Akiva Goldsman who wrote ""Batman Forever"" coughs up a steady supply of lame puns (""Chill"" orders Mr. Freeze) but little in terms of new twists or narrative momentum. Poison Ivy the sinuous villainess is the only relief from the onslaught of spoofy humor special effects and meaningless comic book mayhem. Ivy previously a dowdy botanist mutates into a mammal-hating half-plant half-woman following yet another laboratory mishap. A cross between Mae West and a spear of asparagus the vampy veggie can infatuate a man with her breath and kill him with a kiss. She uses her flower powers to turn Robin against Batman but she cant lay a tendril on the duos athletic new partner Batgirl (inane Alicia Silverstone). Batgirl the butlers British niece by day spends the day railing at Batmans billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne for forcing her Uncle Alfred (Michael Gough) into a life of servitude. That along with Alfreds illness and the rebellious Robins whining supplants Waynes old mood swings and romantic infatuations. Elle Macpherson plays Waynes love interest but he hardly notices what with nursing Alfred and tending to the youngsters. Yes family values have come to the belfry. And now that weve got family values how about a little family planning? We have a surfeit of Bats and the guano lies thick on the cave floor. The current Bat cycle was already tired when Schumacher replaced Tim Burton behind the camera on ""Batman Forever."" This chapter -- so action-packed yet so insufferably dull -- makes it clear that theres nowhere else to go. Batman amp; Robin is rated PG-13 for violence and language.

Considerably later in this loud long and pointless spectacle Uma Thurman - decked out in chlorophyll green as vine-y vixen Poison Ivy - comments approvingly on the Cowled Crusaders ``anatomically correct Batsuit.Yes the nipples on the breastplate are back.In addition to the kinky rubber worn by Batman Robin and Alicia Silverstones Batgirl Schumacher resurrects the gang-rapist Droogs of A Clockwork Orange (in a cameo that also includes guys in West Side Story greaser gear) and takes us to a couple of nightspots that could easily pass as biker bars and gay discos.If Batman amp; Robin is about anything it seems to be about fetishism. By far the campiest of the four Batman movies (it gives the 60s TV series a run for its money when it comes to jokey excess and dumb double entendres) the movie is also the least entertaining.Problems? Well first theres George Clooney replacing Batman Forevers Val Kilmer as billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne a.k.a. the Bat guy. Square-jawed and furry-browed Clooney looks the part but he also looks lost - uncertain whether to play this stuff straight or for laughs. And theres something wrong with his voice too a kind of flat reedy delivery thats in marked contrast to the rippling musculature of his costume. As a TV doctor chasing gurneys and girls on ER Clooney has a certain amount of presence. As Batman/Bruce Wayne hes dwarfed by the mega-budget special effects kabooming all around him.After watching Clooney and Kilmer you begin to appreciate how effective Michael Keaton was in the first two Bat-pics He was actually doing something. He was broodingly funny. There was a character there - not just an actor in a silly suit.And speaking of silly suits theres Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze Batman amp; Robins subzero baddie. Wearing chrome-plated cumbersome armor (its designed to keep him refrigerated at a frosty 50 below) and silvery-blue body paint Schwarzenegger can hardly walk across a room. He looks like Robocop just escaped from a meat locker. And when it comes to delivering his lines - well his first line (as hes deep-freezing Gotham Citys Museum of Art) is a terribly droll ``The iceman cometh Its downhill from there. (Schwarzenegger gets his own drama coach in the credits and theres a dialect coach too but the stars line-readings amid a cacophony of overstaged fight scenes become increasingly incomprehensible.)Schumacher and his production designer have cartoonized the Gotham City of Tim Burtons 1989 Batman It now looks more like Disneyland (a Disneyland taken over by Russian Constructivists) than the dark dramatically decadent place it once was.Playing Poison Ivy - a misguided horticulturalist who has an accident that transforms her into an evil babe with flaming orange hair two-tone fingernails and a literally lethal kiss - Thurman gets off a few amusing quips. She seems to have modeled her performance on the husky-voiced sex bombs of Old Hollywood Shes Mae West with moss.Decorating a few scenes are Elle MacPherson (as Bruce Waynes commitment-hungry girlfriend) Viveca A. Fox (her characters oh-so-clever moniker Ms. B. Haven) and supermodel Vendela assigned the thankless and mostly motionless role of Freezes very sick wife. She has something called ``McGregors Syndrome - also the ailment it turns out that Bruce Waynes lovable manservant Alfred (Michael Gough) is suffering from. In Batman amp; Robin it looks as if good old Alfred might kick.What else is going on? Robins in a funk because Batmans always stealing the limelight and the spotlight - as in the Batsignal. The Boy Wonder wonders why he cant get a Robin-signal to light up the night sky. And theres some icky stuff near the end with Batman Robin and Batgirl (Silverstone playing a niece of Alfreds has hied over from ``Oxbridge University and discovers the Batcave) talking about teamwork and family values.You know The family that fightsexorbitantly-paid-Hollywood-actors-dressed-as-ridiculous-bad-guys together stays together.BATMAN amp; ROBIN  Produced by Peter MacGregor-Scott directed by Joel Schumacher written by Akiva Goldsman photography by Stephen Goldblatt music by Elliot Goldenthal distributed by Warner Bros.

While no worse than a lot of whats out there this summer Batman amp; Robin nevertheless strikes me as the least distinctive chapter in the ongoing bat-saga.As youve doubtless heard ERs George Clooney takes over the cowl from Val Kilmer who filled in for Michael Keaton. As usual Batman is eclipsed here by his fellow costumed characters which this time include Robin (Chris ODonnell) and Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) as well as the chilling Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the lethal Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman).Whats different this time is the degree to which Batman has been batted out of his own movie.Clooney does have the advantage of being the only one of the cine-Batmen to actually look like the tall dark athletic hero that we former comic-book fans have always imagined. But hes given so little of substance to do in Batman amp; Robin that you could call him the Lite Knight.In fact Gotham City has gotten so crowded that its tough for any of these characters to make an impression.ODonnell gives what Ive already come to think of as his usual adequate performance as Batmans petulant junior partner. Silverstone of Clueless makes an agreeably crisp Batgirl but shes not so much in this movie as in what amounts to a trailer for the next one.Speaking of clueless Schwarzenegger seems mostly defeated by the role of Mr. Freeze which like all Batman villains requires broad operatic-scale emoting. Arnold has always been best when he has been simple.There are two sides to the character played by Thurman (Pulp Fiction) who pretty much walks off with the picture.She starts off as a nerdy scientist whose passion for plants is hilariously intense. Transformed into Poison Ivy (whose kisses can kill) she acquires a slinky green outfit and a Mae West lilt in her voice.The cast also includes supermodel Elle Macpherson in the perfunctory role of Bruce Waynes girlfriend supermodel Vendela K. Thommessen in a cameo as Mrs. Freeze and non-supermodel Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Gough has quite a bit to do in his fourth go-round as Batmans butler. (Alfred it turns out is Batgirls uncle.)If Batman amp; Robin gets by thats partly because the filmmakers do respect the main characters still-mythic stature. Its also because theres enough going on that some of it is almost bound to be fun or at least diverting.I laughed when Mr. Freeze interrupted by a henchman while viewing a video of himself and his beloved wife fired his deadly freeze gun at the offending party.I hate when people talk during the movie he explained.The main problem isnt simply that there are too many major characters running around (or even that the action is sometimes incoherent). Its that the filmmakers cant seem to to decide what kind of movie this is.Director Tim Burtons first two films were disturbingly dark - bats out of hell you might say. And the third from director Joel Schumacher was a flamboyant action flick kind of like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.This new one however is a bat-smorgasbord of action camp pathos spectacle (an early action scene reminded me of the Ice Capades) and whatever. The styles dont clash so much as they cancel each other out.Although the film is credited to Schumacher and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman his frequent collaborator its blandness suggests a committee effort.Much of Batman amp; Robin in fact seems recycled from Batman Returns as if the Warner Bros. honchos still smarting from the mixed audience reaction to that especially dark series episode had decided to do things right this time.As good as Thurman is as Poison Ivy for example the conception of the character recalls the Catwoman of the earlier film. Mr. Freeze meanwhile brings with him a wintry chill that brings to mind the snow-filled scenes of Batman Returns.Drastic freshening is what this troubled bat-franchise desperately needs to fly high again.Im not talking about new heroes to help Batman or new more bizarre villains for him to fight or even elaborately restyled costumes and hardware. Im talking about a genuinely fresh vision that would affect everything as Burtons shocking view of Batman did.Thats not something you get by committee. Thats something that strikes without warning.In the dead of night most likely.

With George Clooney Arnold Schwarzenegger. Directed by Joel Schumacher. At area theaters. Running time 130 mins. Rated PG-13. 2 STARS IF YOU ENJOY THE SOUND of metal clanging against metal and who doesnt? youll love ""Batman and Robin"" the fourth installment in Warner Brothers hugely successful superhero series. For those less enchanted by digitally reproduced industrial clamor ""Batman and Robin"" has a lot less to offer than its predecessors. After a grandiose painfully overamplified opening its the first time Ive ever felt mugged by the main titles Joel Schumachers film settles into a numbingly predictable rhythm of overproduced incoherent action scenes followed by underdeveloped insincere dramatic sequences. Its a film singularly devoid of humor joy and bounce though Barbara Lings retro-surreal production design does make it look as good as any 100 million movie of the last few years. Under Joel Schumachers direction (he took over with 1995s ""Batman Forever"") the Batman movies have backed away from the brooding expressionistic qualities of Tim Burtons first two entries. Instead theyve become our decades answer to the Jackie Gleason or Ed Sullivan show essentially old-fashioned variety revues featuring the biggest stars of the moment each performing a condensed version of their regular routines backed by multiple costume changes extravagant production numbers and spectacu lar sets. Except now the June Taylor dancers are armed and dangerous. The violence though rated PG-13 is intense and consistent enough to make the film inappropriate for younger children. Stepping into the Batman role a character so vaguely written that it seems to make little real difference who plays him George Clooney effortlessly imports the lightness and irony of his TV work. He makes good company whenever hes on screen his casual manner providing a happy contrast to the straining gigantism that surrounds him. But the unassuming Clooney is upstaged by the films gaudy villains Arnold Schwarzenegger spray-painted silver and spouting endless puns (""Keep cool"") as the renegade cryogenics scientist Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman vamping it up as a nerdy botanist turned into a leggy if leguminous femme fatale named Poison Ivy. Engaged in a negligently defined plot to avenge themselves on all mankind (Ivy on behalf of the plant world Freeze for having fallen into a vat of cryogenic liquid) the two heavies are disappointingly glum figures played with none of the anarchic delight that defined Jack Nicholsons Joker or Jim Carreys Riddler. Clooney loses more screen time to Chris ODonnell returning as a Robin with dangerously raging hormones and Alicia Silverstone markedly less radiant than she was in ""Clueless"" as a female intruder in the all-male Batcave. In the last reel she slips into leather gear just like the boys and becomes to no particular effect Batgirl. Theres a perfunctory attempt to establish a romance between Batman and an obviously dubbed Elle Macpherson whose combination of dazzling good looks and complete physical klutziness suggests she might have been more effectively cast as Mr. Freezes cryogenically frozen wife. A hint of suspense is established by giving Batmans loyal butler Alfred (Michael Gough) an exotic rare disease a plot device making a rare appearance outside daytime television. Otherwise the film marches through a series of action set pieces a deadly hockey game some space surfing in the outer atmosphere the now standard attacks on various charity balls that dont skimp on the sound and fury but cant cover up the lack of a story. Theres plenty to look at but nothing to feel. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Share Tweet The fourth installment of the lucrative Batman series is the weakest yet but anyone not expecting that after 1995s Batman Forever will probably be too dazed by all the bright lights in the theater lobby to notice anyway. Having abandoned all traces of Tim Burtons dark Gotham director Joel (D.C. Cab) Schumacher simply piles on the spectacle while moving the movies sensibility ever closer to that of the 60s TV series. The opening scene--in which a flashy new Batmobile is unveiled with all the reverence afforded to a relic of The True Christ--pretty much sets the tone but it may also be the quintessential big-budget 90s Hollywood ""come hither fools and gaze upon our expensive hardware"" moment. The story involves Arnold Schwarzeneggers quest as the mad Dr. Freeze to find a cure for his wifes dread MacGregors syndrome. Meanwhile Uma Thurmans Earth First-ish Poison Ivy--a combination of Mae West Rachel Carson and Aileen Wuornos--seeks some revenge of some sort. Helping hunk doctor George Clooney and his titular sidekick to ward off this peril is Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse backwards. In fact with the exception of Chris ODonnells Burt Ward-like Boy Wonder most of Batman And Robins poorness cannot be blamed on its actors. After all how much room for interpretation is there in such pun-riddled dialogue as ""Its time to kick some ice"" or ""Freeze the heat is on"" especially when its set against a neon-drenched backdrop? Somewhere someone decided that the world needed a superhero movie that looked and felt like a bad Broadway musical without the songs--all vacant camp and hollow flash with virtually no reference to anything beyond itself.

Directed by Joel Schumacher from a script by Akiva Goldsman. Alderwood Auburn Cinema 17 Bella Bottega 7 Crossroads Everett 9 Factoria Issaquah 9 Kent 6 Lewis amp; Clark Meridian 16 Metro Mountlake 9 Oak Tree Renton Village SeaTac Mall SeaTac North South Hill Mall Totem Lake Valley drive-in. 130 minutes. ""PG-13"" - Parental guidance advised because of ""strong stylized action and some innuendos."" Fourth times not the charm in this rambling sequel which gets off to a roaring start then quite literally crashes. Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) whose silver-blue gun instantly turns people into icicles engages Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris ODonnell) in an ice-skating battle that escalates when he takes off in a spaceship with Batman trapped inside and Robin clinging to the ships rapidly cooling exterior. A complicated situation turns more so when Robin finds a way inside Mr. Freeze abandons ship the vehicle is set to detonate and all three find a novel way back to Gotham City. This opening sequence is scary exhilarating and utter nonsense. It promises plenty of mindless summer-sequel fun in the style of ""The Lost World"" rather than ""Speed 2"" yet nothing else comes close to matching its excitement or casual absurdity. Theres no narrative hook to carry the picture for two-hours-plus and most of the new additions to the cast have zero impact. In place of the enigmatic neurotic Batman previously played by Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer we get George Clooney who plays him as Mr. Nice Guy. When the script turns sappy as it tends to do in the second half this begins to look like a particularly inappropriate choice. Once the mush starts flowing Clooney doesnt know how to stop it or wink at it and the picture grinds to a halt. Elle MacPherson turns up as Julie Madison the most perfunctory of Batmans girlfriends. Its a shock to discover theyve been dating for a year; they barely seem to exist on the same planet. Alicia Silverstone is game enough as Batgirl but in spite of a few flashes of naughtiness the script lets her down. Schwarzenegger is not at all a bad choice for the chief villain and his makeup and costumes are pretty wonderful. But hes not given enough to do after that first battle and his threats begin to sound empty. More successful is Uma Thurman whose lethal bad girl Poison Ivy steals whats left of the show. She vamps her way through the final scenes appearing Dietrich-like in a gorilla suit brassily declaring her sexual powers (""I really am to die for"") and tempting the hormone-driven Robin to abandon the increasingly exasperated Batman who wonders why ""all the gorgeous ones are homicidal maniacs."" Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman spends more time creating chill-out jokes (""The iceman cometh"" declares Mr. Freeze) and frosty one-liners (""Who killed the dinosaurs? The ice age"") than he does constructing a workable plot. You get the feeling hes working from a thesaurus or a book of Mr. Freeze puns; the actors have a difficult time making them sound fresh. Clooney and the director Joel Schumacher are already threatening a fifth installment. Perhaps its time to get back to basics and examine what made this series work - at first. Tim Burtons inspired noirish ""Batman"" (1989) overturned the campy cliches of the 1960s television series and the Z-movie cheapness of the 1940s serials based on Bob Kanes DC Comics. But it led three years later to Burtons depressed ""Batman Returns"" which suggested that neither Burton nor Keaton were interested in repeating themselves. Both bailed when Warner Bros. decided to make another sequel and Kilmer and Schumacher took over the franchise in 1995. Schumachers ""Batman Forever"" was a mess but it wasnt as deliberately unpleasant as Burtons follow-up film so it was more popular. Hence we have Schumacher again just two years after the last installment. The longest Batman movie to date ""Batman amp; Robin"" is also the most expensive. Variety recently estimated that the total cost will hit 160 million; apparently 25 million of that went to Schwarzenegger who gets top billing. At this rate if the next one doesnt gross 1 billion it will be considered a loser. ------------------------ `Batman - 1960s and now ------------------------ NEW BATGIRL Played by Alicia Silverstone.

"No. 4 `Batman Strikes Out - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies. Flicks picks.No. 4 `Batman Strikes OutJune 20 1997|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ""Batman amp; Robin"" a sniggering exhausting overproduced extravaganza that has virtually all of the humanity pounded out of it in the name of an endless parade of stunt sequences. You know youre in trouble when the most appealing character in the film is Bruce Waynes dying butler Alfred. Because hes ill hes quiet and because hes quiet we are allowed to get close to him. Everyone else in the picture -- every thing in the picture -- is part of a noisy adventure scene that slams us back into our seats.George Clooney turns out to be a good-looking bore as the Caped Crusader; Chris ODonnell is a perfectly serviceable Robin and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Uma Thurman are indelible villains. So why is it all such a bore? Because sequence after sequence turns out the same; you could switch their order and it wouldnt make much of a difference. A loud musical chord introduces a scene change followed by action and then a couple of characters trade one-liners. Its as if 20 directors each created a single scene and they all worked at the same fever pitch.The story has Batman trying to deal with two villains and a jealous partner. Robin wants his own signal in the sky after his ego is toyed with by a perfume-dispensing babe nicknamed Poison Ivy (lanky Thurman) who together with an ice-hosing Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) wants to -- what else? -- -- take over the world. Also popping up in the story is Alicia Silverstone foolishly playing an English teen who comes to live in Wayne Manor and ends up in black leather too.Speaking of leather and such an offensive part of the screenplay of ""Batman amp; Robin"" is the number of crotch and sex jokes. Poison Ivy must have found some Rusty Warren records in her parents closet because her every utterance is aimed below the belt. Sample dialog After a smitten Robin asks ""Is your thumb the only part of you thats green?"" she responds ""Youll just have to find out."" Now who is that line for? The teen-age set? Believe me there are at least 20 lines like that.Significantly my favorite action sequence in ""Batman amp; Robin"" is the first one -- a battle in the Gothams Museum of Natural History that devolves from rollerblading into ice hockey. After that the whole movie is a blur of noise and gangs and gadgets. Rated PG-13. (star) (star)- HERCULES. The least of the new Disney animated features a lamely drawn story about how the son of Zeus must learn to achieve greatness on his own in the earthly world of human beings. Sort of a male version of ""The Little Mermaid"" this tale comes up way short by comparison. Zeus and his heavenly lair are no match for that of King Triton under the sea. Indeed the only memorable character in the film is the nicely drawn villain Hades (voice by James Woods) who seeks to turn Hercules to the dark side. Hades supplies the genie-like patter that Robin Williams provided in ""Aladdin."" Hes funny but the rest of the story is generic rites-of-passage material. And the biggest surprise is how soft and cheap the animation looks. This ""Hercules"" doesnt even look like a Disney film. G. (star) (star)- MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING. A charming sometimes even smart romantic comedy about a New York food critic (Julia Roberts) who is invited to an old boyfriends wedding to serve as the maid of honor only to discover that shed rather be the bride. So she plots to break up the wedding and becomes part of a love quadrangle that includes her old flame (Dermot Mulroney) his upbeat young fiance (the beguiling Cameron Diaz from ""The Mask"") and her editor (Rupert Everett in a rare gay role that doesnt devolve into stereotyping). Because most of the characters are writers the script is necessarily literate and that is a refreshing change of pace for a juvenile summer movie season. All four actors perform with intelligence too working with eyes that reveal longing regret and hope. PG-13. (star) (star) (star) 1/2- PONETTE. A poignant story about a 4-year-old French girl whose mother dies in a car accident in which the girl and her father survive. She suffers ridicule and guilt from her playmates and prays to be able to communicate with her mother. Aside from any psychological insights into childhood trauma the movie is most effective as simply a chance to vicariously experience a childs nightmare because the performance by 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol is so absolutely credible. In French with English subtitles. No MPAA rating. (star) (star) (star)- TEMPTRESS MOON. Chen Kaiges study of the dissolution of a 1920s Imperial China family wracked by sexual politics and drugs. His story focuses on the restrictive sex roles in traditional China that make love between the sexes an afterthought. Gong Li stars in a fine-looking albeit convoluted story. R. (star) (star) (star)- ULEES GOLD. One of the years best films from the fine writer-director Victor Nunez (""Gal Young Un"" ""Ruby in Paradise"") about a Florida beekeeper (Peter Fonda) hard-pressed to keep his family together after his one grown son goes to jail. The performance by Fonda is certain to be remembered at Oscar time next year; he simply glows with a mixture of pain and resolve as he battles to survive unrelenting travail including a daughter-in-law on drugs. In a summer of films where action replaces humanity ""Ulees Gold"" is welcome relief. R.

The series began under Tim Burtons twisted gaze with a grave Gothic grandiloquence that appealed to kids and grown-ups alike. Now its just silly. Batman amp; Robin is a costume party for 9-year-olds - albeit with kinky Samp;M-inspired costumes. Noisy campy overproduced its abdicated all solemnity in pursuit of a boom-kaboom videogame esthetic.As his sidekicks proliferate the new Batman (George Clooney) almost seems superfluous to the story which is turned over to the villains. This time out its Arnold Schwarzeneggers Mr. Freeze - a giant human popsicle who turns his enemies to ice - and Uma Thurmans Poison Ivy - an eco-freak femme fatale with a deadly venom kiss - who team up to bring Gotham City to its knees. Arnolds silver-skinned Mr. Freeze makes a wonderful objet dart but """"Revenge is a dish best served cold is not a line that trips mellifluously off the Big Guys tongue. Uma is amateurish as the mousy botanist Dr. Pamela Isley but once she metamorphoses into the vampy Mae West-ian Ms. Ivy her appeal is self-evident.As for our heroes Chris ODonnells Robin has become a petulant brat Alicia Silverstones Batgirl is a Valley Girl lightweight and the attempt to wring pathos from Alfred the butlers terminal illness produces not a single genuine emotion. How is Clooney? Hes got all the right stuff to be terrific and nothing to play. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman has written quips not characters in lieu of a part Clooney just wears a mischievous little smile to go along with his anatomically enhanced rubber suit. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Joel Schumacher still seems miscast as a Bat-action director he stages the mayhem confusingly and the comedy too broadly. He does however have an eye for spectacle the one aspect of """"Batman that remains seductive is designer Barbara Lings Gotham City. Theres a potent dangerous allure to these looming cityscapes.

A pair of noseplugs wouldnt hurt either. The fourth installment in the Batman franchise is one long head-splitting exercise in clueless cacophony that makes you feel as though youre being held hostage in some haywire Planet Hollywood while sonic booms pummel your auditory canal. The ostensible villains of the piece are Uma Thurmans Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzeneggers Mr. Freeze but the real bad guy is Mr. Sound. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The first two Batman movies--Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (92)--were Tim Burton dark fests in which Bruce Wayne carried on like a Wagnerian sufferer. Batman much more than its dank poisonous sequel was an amazingly serioso gothic fantasia. Burton may have drawn on pulp sources but his movie wasnt remotely pulpy; it was far too obsessive and full-bodied for that. When Joel Schumacher took over the franchise with Batman Forever he clearly wanted to move the proceedings from the opera house to the toy store; if Burton took his lead from Frank Millers revisionist Dark Knight Returns Schumacher went all the way back to the Bill Finger/Jerry Robinson Batman of the 50s. Batman Forever (95) felt like it went on forever because its only allure was a seemingly endless supply of frou-frou frills and in-your-face special effects. It was a colossal video-game movie Nothing in it not even Jim Carreys Riddler or Val Kilmers sneaky-somnolent Bruce Wayne/Batman had any more staying power than a blip on a screen. Batman amp; Robin features George Clooney as Batman whos as staunch and square-jawed in the role as . . . Adam West. Clooney doesnt go in for a lot of heavy brooding like his predecessors particularly Michael Keaton; Clooneys Bruce Wayne isnt tortured any longer just a little annoyed. Schumacher and his screenwriter Akiva Goldsman concoct a tender confab between Bruce Wayne and his ailing long-term manservant Alfred (Michael Gough) who spouts ""wisdom"" like Obi-wan Kenobi. (Sample ""For what is Batman but an attempt to contradict death itself?"") They also work up peckish rivalries between the Batguy and Robin/Dick Grayson (the ever-bland Chris ODonnell). But any display of bona fide human emotion in this enterprise is quickly quashed by the din. The addition of Batgirl (Val-gal Alicia Silverstone)--Alfreds niece Barbara Wilson--doesnt significantly punch up the proceedings. She seems to be in the movie not so much to give young women in the audience a heroine but rather to set straight our nagging thoughts about two guys wearing capes who live together. Despite the films pseudofeminist angle this new Batman is as macho fetishistic as ever The opening credits give us full frontal body armor and codpieces and in a touching display of gallantry on the part of the filmmakers Batmans and Robins body-suit nipples are far more pronounced than Batgirls. To be fair we dont get any nipples on Mr. Freeze either--which seems remiss since hes encased in clanking climate-controlled platinum armor. Freezes get-up is the one original touch in the movie; hes like a cross between a steroid-pumped Tin Man and Brigitte Helm from Fritz Langs Metropolis. Freeze got this way because in his previous life as a Nobel Prize-winning scientist he screwed up an experiment and now must freeze his body temperature to stay alive. Hes still the warmest character in the movie by default. What gets to you isnt Freezes attempt to revive the wife he froze until he could cure her wasting disease. No what touches the soul is Schwarzeneggers heroic attempt to get his mouth around the English language--still. Schwarzenegger is game enough to work his accent into a semblance of a comic style--he pronounces it ""Bat-min""--but he sounds like a Prussian Mike Mazurki. When you can make out whats hes saying at all. Thurmans Poison Ivy is a slinky creeper who spends most of the movie in various botanically tinted body stockings or magenta gorilla suits. With Freeze Poison Ivy wants to take over Gotham City--the world--and save the plants. Shes a cartoon nightmare of a Greenpeacer--or she would be if the filmmakers had any penchant for satire or humor above the level of an after-school special. But Thurman has her moments especially when shes blowing pink love dust at her victims; shes like a rain-forest Mae West. Since shes the only actor in the film who seems to know what to do with a laugh line we find ourselves in the unusual position of actually laughing. The people who made this movie--which as always is set up for a sequel--will be laughing all the way to the bank. But isnt there someone in that bank who can lock them all inside a safety-deposit vault and throw away the key? Batman amp; Robin Directed by Joel Schumacher.

In Batman amp; Robin he slips on the old rubber ears as comfortably as he suits up in surgical scrubs on TV each week on ER. In Clooneys first scene with Chris ODonnell -- himself fully installed at this point as the perkiest of frat-brother sidekicks -- Robin enviously eyeing his mentors Batmobile whines that he wants wheels too. ""Thats why Superman works alone"" mutters Batman as he zooms away solo. Clooney delivers this bit of commentary with such gracious oomph that we relax immediately instinctively recognizing that unlike Michael Keatons Batman (a brooder) or Val Kilmers Batman (a scowler) this superhero is accessible urbane TV-friendly. Hes Batman the Guy All the most interesting stuff in Batman amp; Robin and all the wittiest dialogue in screenwriter Akiva Goldsmans lively script take place all in the family in the brother-brother relationship between the title duo (Robin expressing feelings of competition and horniness -- for babes that is; Batman teaching the importance of partnership and trust); in the father-son bond between Alfred (Michael Gough as ever) and Bruce ""Batman off duty"" Wayne; in the new brother-sister bond forged between Robin and motorcycle daredevil Barbara Wilson a.k.a. Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone sweet appealing and no pushover). But unfortunately the charming Batfamily cant stay in their cave indefinitely; theyve got to go out and fight crime. And thats where this elaborately high-style production from Batman Forever director Joel Schumacher hits an iceberg. Two big new villains are up to no good Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a former molecular biologist who threatens to chill the town to death and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) a former botanist who packs a toxic kiss. The double trouble of the icy and the hot the frigid and the sexual has an elegant symmetry to it. But each character is such a one-dimensional idea -- and each actor is such a dramatic clunker -- that they slow down the works every time they appear. Schwarzenegger in particular (billed above Clooney and paid a price far above rubies for the burden of stepping into a fancy Bubble Boy suit and intoning quote-me punchlines like ""The Iceman cometh"") is a monolithically heavy presence. Thurman aint heavy but neither is she the chlorophyll-filled femme fatale she aspires to be. Separately or together the two are distractions rather than attractions. And that spells trouble in Gotham City. By now the dispatching of various comic-book meanies is the least satisfying part of the deal no matter how many disco scenes or gizmos are thrown onto the screen. Its in our interest in the mature suaveness of Batman the blooming hunkiness of Robin and the nymphy possibilities of Batgirl that the franchise has a heartbeat. Its an odd day in Tinseltown when Schwarzenegger in sci-fi makeup is less exciting than a TV actor who does battle in his tights. But as they say in the comics thats charisma baby. When youre hot youre hot and when youre not youre a frozen stiff.

Comments Batman amp; Robin ""Try not to leave a mess when you die"" intones Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) in this loud uninspired and interminable third sequel; but the movie doesnt take her advice. Theres a lot of designer leather and designer heavy metal and one designer disco set after another plenty of tacky camp references to Marlene Dietrich and Mae West plus Star Wars beasties AIDS metaphors computer details stupid ""cold"" puns from Arnold Schwarzenegger (playing villain Mr. Freeze) and dollops of insincere sentimentality involving the heroes butler (Michael Gough). But its clear that writer Akiva Goldsman and director Joel Schumacher are bereft of ideas and using the MTV clutter as a cover-up. A few nice moments are offered by spunky Alicia Silverstone but the standard for humor and ingenuity is set by Robin (Chris ODonnell) calling Batman (George Clooney this time around) a ""dick.""

The villains Arnold Schwarzenegger and especially Uma Thurman in this instance remain the highlights here as the rest of the gargantuan production lacks the dash and excitement that would have given the franchise a boost in its eighth year. Nonetheless all the commercial elements are in place for B.O. that will follow in the flight path of the three previous blockbusters. Mr. Freeze/Dr. Batman loses a bit of altitude and velocity in this fourth installment of Warner Bros. hugely successful series. The villains Arnold Schwarzenegger and especially Uma Thurman in this instance remain the highlights here as the rest of the gargantuan production lacks the dash and excitement that would have given the franchise a boost in its eighth year. Nonetheless all the commercial elements are in place for B.O. that will follow in the flight path of the three previous blockbusters. The series has remained aloft due to highly effective all-star casting of the baddies as well as refreshment and expansion of other talent in front of and behind the camera. George Clooney as Batman and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl are the new arrivals this time out with Chris ODonnell back for his sophomore appearance as Robin and director Joel Schumacher up to the plate for a second time as well. Unfortunately the operative word is bland as the newcomers dont add much to the formula leaving it to their nemeses to enliven the proceedings. Narrative drive and humor are also in short supply which creates a serious sag in the middle when the novelty of the fresh components has mostly worn off. Initial suiting up of the black-caped duo constitutes the most self-consciously conspicuous fetishizing yet of the anatomically sculpted Batgear this in preparation for their initial battle with Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) a warrior bedecked in climate-controlled armor and equipped with an awesome frost-spewing gun that freezes everything in its sights. Initial set piece in which Freeze unleashes his ice-skating goons on the winged twosome is somewhat silly since the minions spend more time playing hockey with a giant diamond coveted by Freeze than trying to accomplish their mission which is to kill the good guys. But the follow-up is pretty spectacular  with Freeze blasting off in a private spaceship with Batman captive inside and Robin clinging outside followed by some radical air surfing back to Gotham City. Like nearly everyone including the heroes in a Batman story Mr. Freeze is a tortured soul driven to an extreme double life due to a past tragedy. In his previous life he was Dr. Victor Fries a brilliant scientist who due to an accident must now maintain his body temperature at zero. He is also a hopeless romantic who keeps his beautiful wife (supermodel Vendela K. Thommessen) the victim of a degenerative disease in a state of frozen suspended animation until he can devise a cure for her. In the meantime revenge is the word as it is for a nerdy horticulturist (Thurman) who emerges from of a near-fatal incident in the curvy form of an outrageously sexy vamp Poison Ivy bent on destroying the human race for its offenses to all things green. The slinky Ivy needs only to blow some of her special love dust in the face of any man in order to subdue him and a kiss from her is literally a kiss of death. Back at Bruce Waynes mansion there are also problems as the billionaires beloved butler Alfred (Michael Gough) doesnt appear well. But the old man is buoyed by the arrival from England of his niece Barbara (Silverstone) whose demure good-girlishness belies a secret taste for the souped-up motorcycles stashed in the Batcave. The latter spur the silliest sequence in the picture in which Barbara hangs out with a bunch of lowlifes at night prior to an utterly gratuitous motorcycle drag race that looks like something out of ""The Lost Boys."" The Bruce Wayne side of the story has always posed a problem in the current series and this installment is no exception as the at-home chitchat consists of this group of orphans discussing the need for trust and family and Bruce/Batman having to throw cold water on Dick/Robin whos hot for both Barbara and Poison Ivy. Midsection is woefully low on conflict and incident with Mr. Freeze temporarily in custody Barbara lolling about and Poison Ivy failing to fatally seduce either Batface or Birdbrain as she calls her adversaries. Things pick up when Ivy frees Freeze and informing him that the flying rodents have pulled the plug on his wife (when she in fact has jealously done so) inspires him to join her in a partnership of Adam and Evil to freeze Gotham City and decimate the worlds human population. Late in the game Barbara transforms into Batgirl to less than electrifying effect to help her protectors fight the ultimate battle which sees Freeze turning Bruce Waynes powerful telescope into a giant ice gun with which he can spray the entire city. As the victims must be thawed within minutes or be frozen forever Batman Robin and Batgirl shift into high gear resulting in a protracted sequence as thunderously numbing as the climax for any other  100 million action film in recent memory. Ongoing technological advances have made the effects if not the production design even more grandiose than in the previous Batman outings although not necessarily to more edifying or thrilling effect. Batmans abilities were never about special effects (he cant even fly really) and shouldnt have to compete with things that morph in the night. Physically Clooney is unquestionably the most ideal Batman to date but none of the series screenwriters has ever gotten a handle on how to make the character as interesting as those around him and Clooney is unable to compensate onscreen for the lack of dimension on paper. It is difficult to think of another superhero series in which it would matter so little who plays the part and it is indicative of the ongoing flaw in the Batman franchise that the changes in leading men have so little impact on the films popularity or effectiveness. ODonnell mainly conveys a boyish eagerness that must continually be channeled and tempered by his guardian while Silverstone in her first bigscreen appearance since breaking through in ""Clueless"" makes a particularly disappointing impression as she brings no special flair or energy to her potentially choice role. That leaves it to the villains. Schwarzenegger painted a silvery blue and heavily encased is forced to deliver every cool/cold/chill/ frigid/frozen pun in the book but the Freeze character is so unusual and imposing that he easily holds the interest. But best of all is Thurman imaginatively coifed in red tresses and green body stocking a man trap who taunts her intended victims like a leafy Mae West and is assisted in moments of physical need by a hulking obedient manservant Bane (Jeep Swenson). Her performance has comic wit conspicuously lacking elsewhere in the picture. The production is as physically huge elaborate and expensive as the audience expects it to be. Concluding tag makes it clear that all three Bat heroes can be anticipated in the next installment. Freeze Frames Push Icy BatmanProductionBatman amp; Robin A Warner Bros. release.

Starring George Clooney Chris ODonnell Arnold Schwarzenegger Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Chalk it up to velocity visual wit or Uma Thurman but ""Batman and Robin"" the fourth installment of the series isnt bad. Its the lightest of the Batman movies the most cartoony the dumbest and the least ambitious. But it holds the audiences attention brings on a few laughs and never really gets boring. The movie combines pomp and absurdity -- grand special effects play off against self-mocking dialogue. At times its amusing but it also seems like the easiest reach. A Batman movie convincingly able to inhabit the grandeur of its art direction and special effects would be a real achievement. Instead we get towering music and the pomp and dazzle of the Batcave undercut by Robins turning to Batman and saying in the movies first lines ""I want a car. Chicks dig the car."" Better he should have said ""What happened to Val Kilmer?"" Or ""Holy acting class Batman whats happened to your performance?"" George Clooney is the big zero of the film and should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series. Beyond the sheer bad luck of looking 20 years older in his Batmask Clooney -- hes not a doctor but he plays one on TV -- makes a smug complacent one-dimensional Caped Crusader. Last time out Val Kilmer at times seemed narcissistic in the role but at least Kilmer can act ambiguity. Its as if Clooney didnt spend any time figuring out what makes Batman tick. This is a rich man who is so weird and troubled that he dresses like a bat and chases criminals every night for years and years. Would a normal person do that? The rubber suit alone should have been the tip-off. This guy has problems. THE HEAD-SHAKE THING But Clooney tries to make Batman a smooth dude. Also warm and fuzzy. He looks at people as if hes deeply sensitive and might say something nice if only he werent so cool. Then he does his head- shake thing. Whenever Clooney wants to seem sincere here he nods his head this way and that. Its as emotionally convincing as Bill Clinton biting his bottom lip. As it has evolved ""Batman"" has become a movie series for youngsters a 1990s analogue to the campy TV show of the 1960s. On that show the villains had more to do with the success of an episode than the heroes and thats the case here. This time Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Thurman) come to destroy Gotham City and save the movie. Poison Ivy is the films best creation. Shes a a radical environmentalist who gets bitten by snakes and buried in vines only to rise up gorgeous and redheaded like Botticellis Venus. Like Americas original femme fatale Beatrice in Hawthornes ""Rappaccinis Daughter"" Ivy has a poisonous kiss. Like Dietrich in ""Blonde Venus"" she shows up at a ritzy affair in a gorilla suit. Ivy is a witty combination of visual literary and film references and it doesnt hurt that Thurman is funny. She takes pratfalls makes herself silly. Thurman may be beautiful but shes not vain. Thurman keeps her end of the picture alive and as Freeze Schwarzenegger does his part. Freeze for one thing has that wonderful head shaved frosty gray-blue and speckly. He precipitates all the films action scenes the most impressive of which shows him shooting a freeze gun into Gotham City and freezing people and buildings on the spot. They might as well be frozen. Cluelessness is a state common in Gotham City. No one for example figures out that these guys who live together and show up everywhere together are Batman and Robin. Whats worse Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson never figure out that theyre gay. Its like some sort of crazed sublimation. BATGIRL DOESNT MATTER Instead Robin chases after Alicia Silverstone who becomes Batgirl. Silverstone doesnt embarrass herself and thats about all that can be said for her. Things go by so fast that she doesnt have time to matter. The movie slows down only for the protracted illness of Alfred the butler (Michael Gough) which will make even the kindest member of the audience wish hed just hurry up and die already. In the eight years since the first ""Batman"" the series has become a lightweight commercial franchise capable of occasional delights. But it could have been more. For example it might have been interesting to see how Michael Keaton would have handled the relationship with Robin. A troubled odd Batman probably would have necessitated a far different Robin from ODonnells carping kid. Imagine -- two misfit oddballs fighting crime in a decadent nightmare metropolis. In a better world ""Batman"" might have been an action series for grown-ups.

"The Schumacher Hypothesis Slate Sign In Sign Up The Schumacher Hypothesis The Schumacher Hypothesis Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 22 1997 330 AM The Schumacher Hypothesis Can the director of Batman amp; Robin be said to have an oeuvre? By Alex Ross Batman amp; Robin Directed by Joel Schumacher Warner Bros. I staggered out of a showing of Batman amp; Robin into Times Square. The world looked evil and sad. The sun was sinking out of sight at the end of 43rd Street where signs no longer read ""43rd Street"" but instead ""43rd Street Adolph S. Ochs Street"" in tongue-twisting homage to the patriarch of the New York Times. Five or six neon-striped storefronts seem to have sprouted in the past five or six days. The Disney Complex now has a Hercules Store not to mention a Hercules complex. Billboards high above 42nd Street advertise Amsterdam Beer; fake movie marquees draw attention to them with chortling messages like ""Dont Look Up."" Those fake marquees first appeared during the filming of the Arnold Schwarzenegger bomb Last Action Hero. Afterward they bore pseudo-provocative art-slogan messages of the Jenny Holzer variety. So were looking at fake ads parodying fake slogans parodying fake movie titles. I wish Schwarzenegger would come back now and blow everything up again. I went into McDonalds hoping to find solace in an order of Super-Size Fries. They were stale. Where can you go these days for decent trash? Advertisement When I say that Batman amp; Robin is a punishing ordeal I want you to know where Im coming from. I have an appetite for Hollywood blockbusters of the sort that some literate people consider big and dumb. I thought the first Warner Bros. Batman Tim Burtons pulp opera had genius in it. It invented a huge movie world in which the eyes could go dreaming. It also had the wit to set a menacing hero against a merrymaking villain--the line between good and evil grew scribbly. The last Batman Joel Schumachers Batman Forever was nowhere near as cool but it was clean campy fun from beginning to end and it rode high on a maliciously daft Jim Carrey performance. I was also lucky to see Batman Forever in more pleasant surroundings than the New Times Square--in a high-modern movie palace in Helsinki with an audience of hip Finns who giggled at subtitles that seemed to go their own way from the script. (At one point the Finnish text made some kind of joke about Chevy Chase. No one was saying ""Chevy Chase"" on-screen or possibly could have been.) Now Schumacher is not a talentless filmmaker. Indeed a sophistical argument could be made that his films while meretricious are always at least mildly entertaining. If your next dinner party threatens to turn dull you might try antagonizing sophisticates with a Revisionist Schumacher Hypothesis. St. Elmos Fire? An unflinching descent into the shallowness of the Brat Pack notable for the discovery of the brooding dramatic craft of Demi Moore. The Lost Boys? An innocently homoerotic vampire spoof notable for the discovery of the brooding dramatic craft of Jason Patric. Flatliners and Dying Young? Best passed over in silence. Julia Roberts is found not to be a tragedian. (Dying Young was really notable as the first big whoosh of air out of the balloon of Roberts megastardom.) Falling Down? A descent into white-male white-collar vigilante fantasies. The Grisham diptych The Client and A Time to Kill? Bad movies done in style. Schumacher is once again the maestro of the 8 by10s unveiling the teen idol Brad Renfro and twentysomething dreamboat Matthew McConaughey. ""But this Schumacher is a pompous idiot"" your dinner guests sputter. ""He once said on TheCharlie RoseShow that he made commercial pictures like Batman so he could afford idea pictures like A Time to Kill?"" All too true. But lets at least admit his flair for trash. At his best he offers an empty but internally consistent flamboyance. He is skilled at evoking places Falling Down captured with precision what Los Angeles looks like on a vicious summer day. He is also good with faces particularly male faces. This is not to make assumptions about the mans sexuality--he might just happen to be as gifted a director of slow-witted male models as say George Cukor was of fast-witted female actors. I enjoy this aspect of Schumachers work although I wonder in the case of A Time to Kill whether he worried about McConaugheys inability to enunciate or to assume different facial expressions. The acting is not always an embarrassment; in Falling Down the one Schumacher film that threatened to be decent Michael Douglas delivered one of the creepiest slow burns of the decade. B atman amp; Robin quashes the Schumacher Hypothesis for the time being. (I will have to return to my old contrarian standby the Unsung Greatness of Oliver Stone.) It has none of the minor virtues of Schumachers other films. It looks bad cluttered surfaces production design reminiscent of overblown Broadway musicals editing too fast for the eye to catch up poor staging of fast action. The first few minutes are particularly trying--direction seems to have been handed over to a fractious committee of prepubescent speed freaks. And while this kind of movie doesnt cry out for a coherent plot it does need surprises. Most of Batman amp; Robins cliches were parodied in advance by Austin Powers. (When Commissioner Gordon shows up on a TV monitor warning that Mr. Freeze has taken over Gotham Museum Austin fans will think fondly of the plot-spewing monologues of Basil Exposition.) The smirky George Clooney has no screen charisma. Chris ODonnells strutting crew-cut Robin is a superfluous second superhero indistinct from the first. Uma Thurman tries to interject some vampish style as Poison Ivy but the inanity of her character--environmentalist turned plant woman?--has the audience snickering against her. Alicia Silverstone as a computer whiz turned Batgirl purses her lips uncertainly. Advertisement With so much wrong on every front its hard to single out a basic flaw. But Schwarzenegger has to take the blame for providing no immoral center to the Batman world. Each of the previous Batman films had a sly spry villainous turn with Jack Nicholson Danny DeVito and Jim Carrey dancing through their roles. Schwarzenegger slowly and methodically munches his way through reams of cardboard zingers. ""Winter has come"" ""Everyone chill"" ""The Iceman cometh"" etc. Hes Mr. Freeze see? Arnold has regressed to his ultraprimitive Conan the Barbarian manner except that in this case not even his big frame adds much to a waddling-icicle role. One of the movies few redeeming features is partially wiped out by one of its worst excesses. Elliot Goldenthal the best film composer now working has written typically imaginative music rich in jagged harmony and deft scoring. That eerie wailing at the end of the title theme is a team of trilling horns. Schumachers regard for this composer--he used him also in A Time to Kill--is one sign of latent tastefulness. In movies like Interview With the Vampire and Heat Goldenthal returned the obsolescent Hollywood orchestra to some of its old glory. But in the new Batman the score was apparently deemed insufficient. Its repeatedly blotted out by the sound effects that erupt in tandem with every move or twitch on-screen. One whip of a cape sounds like a rocket blasting off. An actual rocket blasting off--yes at one point Mr. Freeze escapes in a rocket just like Dr. Evil in Austin Powers--sounds like a dentist going to work on your ear. This indiscriminate racket more than anything sent me out into Times Square with the feeling of having been roughed up. The area hasnt changed so much after all.

"Meanwhile Back at the Batcave . . . - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsDepartment of Returns | Movie Review Meanwhile Back at the Batcave . . .Batman amp; Robin flies high on slick images and weaponry but the sequels dialogue and story arent on the same level.June 20 1997|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC The strutting bully that was the Batman franchise is no more. ""Batman amp; Robin"" the fourth film in the series still preens and blusters but theres no knockout punch. Lacking most kinds of inspiration and geared to undemanding minds this project is so overloaded with hardware and stunts its a relief to have it over.A film that boasts 10 Bat weapons specific enough to be mentioned in the press notes (plus four different ""Batarangs"") yet considers lines like ""Freeze youre mad"" to be acceptable dialogue ""Batman amp; Robin"" lives and dies by the aesthetic of excess the familiar idea that anything worth doing is worth overdoing. You may admire its surface but it is far too slick for even a toeholds worth of connection.While it would take more time than its worth to list all the wrinkles of the films Akiva Goldsman plot ""Batman amp; Robin"" has the eerie feeling of having no beginning no middle and no end. Watching it is like stumbling into the worlds longest coming attractions trailer or a product reel for a special-effects house. Director Joel Schumacher usually a genie of popular entertainment (""A Time to Kill"" ""Batman Forever"") has hit the repeat button once too often and found it stuck.Having exhausted other plot formulations this latest foray can be seen as thefamily values ""Batman."" Almost from the opening frame Robin (Chris ODonnell) the whiniest of heroes acts up like a rebellious teenager demanding a car and parental trust from the senior Bat (George Clooney this time around).Then paterfamilias Alfred (Michael Gough) develops a serious ailment leading to mumbles about mortality and Alfreds niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) shows up and demands parity as Batgirl. Its too bad no one thought of casting Dr. Joyce Brothers as an evil therapist giving deadly psychiatric advice.Instead ""Batman amp; Robin"" makes do with two more conventional villains both of whom as it turns out are perverted and demented idealists people who were frustrated in their attempts to do good in the world and ended up terrorizing the vulnerable citizens of Gotham.Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was once top scientist Dr. Victor Fries Olympic athlete Nobel Prize winner and all-around swell guy. But that was before his wife came down with a dread disease and Dr. Fries fell into a cryosolution that mutated his body something fierce. Now hes a walking Popsicle a one-man Ice Age who wants millions of dollars to do more research or else hell freeze Gotham till it turns blue.Freezes determination to chill everything in sight leads to a burst of verbal creativity inspiring--if thats the word--lines like ""Stay cool"" ""Talk about your cold shoulder"" and ""The iceman cometh."" A product tie-in with Fosters Freeze is presumably in the works.Villain No. 2 started out as mousy Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) a scientist devoted to giving plants a fighting chance to take back the Earth. A sinister laboratory accident turns her into the vixenish Poison Ivy a siren with lips so laced with venom that as she puts it ""Im literally to die for."" Using a potion that clouds mens minds she makes both Batman and Robin yearn for her charms which males being what they are leads to conflicts that threaten to rip the Batpartnership apart.While ""Batman amp; Robin"" is not lacking in events its crises are invariably bogus; once the movie is over its impossible to differentiate one chaotic stunt-and-special-effect-filled episode from another.Also despite the impressive names in the cast the film is indifferently acted as if the second team were in to give the regulars a breather. Clooney charming in ""One Fine Day"" neither hinders nor advances his chances at movie stardom here which is more than can be said for his cohorts.If all else fails and it invariably does it is possible to admire the scenery in ""Batman amp; Robin."" Really. Production designer Barbara Ling working with supervising art director Richard Holland and visual effects veteran John Dykstra has created a massive Gotham City that never fails to intrigue the eye. The films look is all that money can buy and as always with blockbuster wannabes like this its a shame that money cant buy even more. MPAA rating PG-13 for strong stylized action and some innuendoes. Times guidelines almost nonstop cartoonish violence.(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)Batman amp; RobinArnold Schwarzenegger Freeze/Dr. Victor FriesGeorge Clooney Batman/Bruce WayneChris ODonnell Robin/Dick GraysonUma Thurman Poison Ivy/Dr. Pamela IsleyAlicia Silverstone Batgirl/Barbara WilsonMichael Gough Alfred PennyworthReleased by Warner Bros.

"WashingtonPost.com Batman Winged Defeat Go to the ""Batman amp; Robin"" Page Batman Winged Defeat By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer June 20 1997 Like a wounded yeti ""Batman amp; Robin"" drags itself through icicle-heavy sets dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines before dying in a frozen heap. Unfortunately that demise occurs about 20 minutes into the movie which leaves you in the cold for approximately 106 minutes. Assuming youve ventured into this territory Id strongly advise you to hibernate. In Akiva Goldsmans dramatically frostbitten screenplay Batman (George Clooney) and his irrepressible sidekicks Robin (Chris ODonnell) and Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) must save Gotham City from a double threat the armored cold-blooded Mr. Freeze whose powerful ice gun can chill his opponents to death and a toxic vine-festooned temptress called Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) whose kiss is deadlier than a weekend in Chernobyl. The premise is way below zero but its an opportunity for gothic creativity. For director Joel Schumacher however who used to be a window-dresser movies arent about themes theyre about schemes. He arranges and choreographs his actors as if they were storefront dummies. He blasts the gothic gloom of Bob Kanes original ""Batman"" comic book series into goofy brightness. The requisite flashbacks -- where Batman recalls his painful childhood -- are delivered with a sense of reluctant obligation. He turns the story into a series of cluttered overextended action pieces. And he inflates every scene with cheap puns mediocre vamping and special effects that dont pump you up so much as wear you down. As with ""Batman Forever"" (which Schumacher also directed) the only subtext here is a salivating jones for powerful chests and firm buttocks. Says Poison Ivy upon seeing Batman ""Theres something about an anatomically correct rubber suit that puts fire in a girls limbs."" Speaking of anatomically correct Schumacher has found his perfect mannequin in Clooney. Bruce Wayne is meant to be a haunted orphan driven to engender civic goodwill by day (as playboy-philanthropist Wayne) and battle criminals to the death by night. Good and evil impulses roil his soul. Not here girlfriend. Clooney -- bless him -- wouldnt know psychic baggage if he had to check it at the airport. His two sidekicks arent exactly the deepest spirits that ever jumpstarted a bat bike. ODonnell plays Robin with high octane perkiness tempered with--more perkiness. And the doughy Silverstone fills Waynes manor with nothing but squishy ineffectual banter. The most compelling battle chez Wayne? Batman finds Robin ""impulsive."" Robin feels that Batman doesnt trust him. ""This is no partnership"" sputters Robin after Batman disables his motorcycle to prevent him from chasing Mr. Freeze. ""Youre never going to trust me."" Please supervillains you mutter quietly. Deliver us from the bland. Arnold and Uma try they really do. But despite evil agendas and a barrage of Bat puns (""Everybody chill"" says Mr. Freeze; ""My garden needs tending"" says Poison Ivy flirtatiously to Robin) they never seem powerful or dynamic. Schwarzeneggers character for one thing is always having to recharge his temperature-controlled body system with diamonds; and Thurmans vampy attempts look tentative and girlish. Of course they both look great Mr. Freeze in a frigid blue motif and Poison Ivy in tendril-ish garments that seem concocted by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the Jolly Green Giant. In Schumachers vision thats all that really counts. But throughout this emptily flashy meandering fashion show of a summer flick one conclusion is clear from the start Its time to discontinue the ""Batman"" line.

Robin Dougherty Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Arnold Schwarzenegger George Clooney Movies Entertainment News holy creative breakdown BatmanInstead of berating Joel Schumacher for spending by some reports upwards of 1.5 million per minute to deliver the summers most inert movie sequel lets stop for a minute and try to figure out what the director thought he was up to.Theres something almost maniacally heroic about packaging the fourth sequel of a superhero action series without resorting to the old standbys of good writing capable acting or inspired directing. With ""Batman amp; Robin"" Schumacher has daringly thrown tradition to the wind proffering instead a vision of Entertainment as a huge computer screen on which little blips -- machines superheroes particles of light -- vie for screen time.OK now heres the tsk-tsking.You wont find any writing acting or directing to speak of in ""Batman amp; Robin"" the most sentimental of the Batman movies and the second directed by Schumacher (in between his film versions of John Grisham thrillers ""The Client"" and ""A Time To Kill""). With George Clooney taking over the Bat-cape from Val Kilmer the franchise may be safe. Lost beneath the overproduced fight scenes the rubber nippled Clooney doesnt really get a chance to embarrass himself much less act. But the Bat-thrills are long gone. Worse Kilmers recent career path -- duds like ""The Saint"" and the bona fide turkey ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" -- seems downright glorious compared to any cachet the swoon-provoking ""ER"" actor is going to take away from this bomb.But then whats art compared to the sale of action figures?In fact when your last Batman movie was 1995s highest grossing film why clutter the next one with characters at all? Its much easier to make a two-hour tableau in which human beings are reduced to toy status by an overwrought production scheme. Schumachers puppets -- Batman Robin Mr. Freeze Poison Ivy and the new Batgirl -- cavort in a universe of industrial light and no magic. Theyre dwarfed by a be-statued Gotham that is itself reduced to a computer-generated collection of cavities shadows and multi-plane camera moves. Spatial relationships be damned. Watching the frenetic choreography of the fight and chase scenes -- Batman and villains sliding down a dinosaur tail in a museums antiquities wing or racing up the outstretched arms and fingers of a Titan-like statue -- its difficult to see whats going on.In fact one of the films best jokes is obfuscated by the inept direction. When Batman and Robin (Chris ODonnell) go after Mr. Freeze they slip and slide on the icy surface the villains created on the museum floor. Then recalling their vast arsenal of nifty gadgets they press buttons on their heels and out pop ice skates on their boots. Clever huh? I nearly missed it and only caught on when I remembered someone describing the scene to me beforehand. You Might Also Like Indeed ""Batman amp; Robin"" is a movie made by machines for other machines to watch. If there are any humans out there still interested heres a checklist of Bat-villains and heroes.Lucking out in the nifty costume department is Alicia Silverstones Batgirl. Despite the tortured way the film introduces her (shes butler Alfreds daffy schoolgirl niece whose parents death provoked her new hobby of motorcycle racing). With her charisma Silverstone would probably make a fine addition if human-scale actions ever find their way back into the Bat-story.Lost amid all the flashiness of the updated Batmobile (and Robins Redbird motorcycle) are cameos by John Glover Coolio Vivica A. Fox and supermodel Vendela K. Thommessen. Elle MacPherson as Bruce Waynes girlfriend is well just lost.The character most in search of better one-liners is Uma Thurmans Poison Ivy. As the only actor who actually compels your attention she plays the villainess as a pencil-thin Mae West in Marie Antoinette hairdos. (Her alter ego scientist Pamela Isley is a demure librarian nursing a revenge fantasy.) Shes saddled with verbal clichis -- from ""Its not nice to fool Mother Nature"" to ""The day of reckoning is coming."" Ted Baxter could write better copy. But could he deliver them with even a fraction of Thurmans panache? Nah. Lets give this villainess her own series. As for you Arnold Schwarzenegger fans -- sorry. As Mr. Freeze a scientist turned villain when he fell into a vat of cryogenic liquid Arnold looks like alternately the Tin Man the Terminator and the chrome parts of a gargantuan walking motorcycle. Under all that silver his eyes are a ghastly red. But the real crime is that Schwarzeneggers exuberance is pinned down. Hes like a moth squashed by an 18-wheeler. Hes also paralyzed by amazingly inert dialogue. How many lame jokes about cold can you fit into two hours? Buy a ticket and find out.In fact lets just line up and put our cash into Schumachers pockets.PHOTOS COURTESY OF WARNER BROS. | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Robin Dougherty is a frequent contributor to Salon.

"Batman and Robin | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; batman-and-robin ) Batman and Robin (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Batman and Robin the fourth entry in the recent Batman movie series the profitable franchise appears poised to take a nosedive. This film which places yet another actor in the batsuit has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless plodding plotting; asinine action; clueless comatose characterization; and dumb dialogue. Sadly for all the batfans who have been waiting with baited breath for this one Batman and Robin has become the latest blight on the long summer movie season. Fetishists will probably love Batman and Robin. There are rubber nipples crotch and butt shots as the dynamic duo (and later Batgirl) suit up bikers and crooks decked out in kinky Clockwork Orange-like regalia and Uma Thurman dressed and acting like a dominatrix. It all goes nicely with the films attempt at sensory overload. Director Joel Schumacher has taken Tim Burtons dark vision of Gotham City and shifted it into overdrive. This is a weird wild wacky world where gothic skyscrapers reach like twisted fingers into the clouds and where the batsignal shines brighter than the moon. However like the movie as a whole this aspect is as briefly captivating as it is hollow and soulless. It quickly becomes clear that the pictures lone selling point is that it looks great but in an era when blockbuster budgets are routinely topping 100 million thats no longer special. Never has Batman been less believable or human. Its not actor George Clooneys fault -- he gives it a game try but really his function is to provide a body to put into the costume. We see even less of Bruce Waynes heart than we do of his face. Gradually over the previous three movies bits and pieces of Batmans character began to surface. Not so here. All attempts at development are obligatory perfunctory and not terribly convincing. The same is true of Chris ODonnells Robin who comes across more as a spoiled brat with an ego problem than an integral member of an unusual family. Then to further complicate matters yet another cardboard-thin hero is added in the person of Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) who equals her caped cohorts when it comes to a ready supply of wisecracks and a lack of personality. In the previous Batman movies the villains took center stage. First it was Jack Nicholsons Joker (Batman) then Danny DeVitos Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman (Batman Returns) followed by Jim Carreys Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face (Batman Forever). Now Arnold Schwarzenegger and Uma Thurman add Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy to the roster. These are the two least-interesting bad guys to date. Schwarzenegger aside from looking like a cross between the Michelin Man and Robocop appears totally confused about what hes doing. Sometimes hes in Terminator mode; on other occasions hes chomping on a cigar like hes back in Last Action Hero. Meanwhile Thurman manages to do a pale imitation of Carrey. Her character is essentially a female representation of the Riddler (scientific experiments gone awry give a mentally-unstable nerd extraordinary powers) only far less engaging. Theres also a hulk of a creature called Bane (Jeep Swenson) whos reduced to playing Oddjob to Poison Ivys Goldfinger. His fate is rather pathetic which proves that it doesnt pay to be the henchman in a movie like this. Theres actually a poignant story behind Freeze. Hes a one-time peace-loving scientist who became obsessed with saving his terminally ill wife regardless of the cost. The forces driving him are therefore incredibly complex -- too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively (wasnt there a point when Patrick Stewart was being mentioned for this role?) or for Schumacher to care about exploring. As a result Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute whos out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice. Old friends like Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) and the ever-reliable Alfred (Michael Gough gamely trying to give a serious performance amidst all this silliness) are back. Both of these men have kept the same face while the lead character has gone through three changes. Supermodel- turned-actress Elle Macpherson is one of many newcomers but her role as Bruce Waynes girlfriend is so small that shes reduced to a background decoration. At times Batman and Robin comes close to matching the tone of the 60s TV series. Only two things are missing the on-screen cartoon captions (""pow"" ""bam"") and an Adam West cameo. Meanwhile anyone who comes to Batman and Robin expecting great action sequences will be disappointed. The fight scenes arent interesting -- theyre poorly choreographed badly edited and interrupted by too many one-liners. The ""hockey team from hell"" sequence is a perfect example it seems to go on forever but were never really sure exactly whats happening (or why its happening for that matter). Batman and Robin moves at a dizzying pace yet goes absolutely nowhere. Somewhere between the quarter and mid-point of this film things turn repetitious and tedious. We see basically the same fight scene re-enacted three or four times -- and it isnt all that impressive on the first occasion. We become numb to the glitz and glamour but looking beyond it we see only a vacuum. In trying to put the ""comic"" back into ""comic book"" Schumacher has reduced Batman to the equivalent of a daily newspaper strip -- disjointed and painfully shallow. The character probably deserves more respect but in Batman and Robin he doesnt get it. And for that matter neither does the audience.

"Batman and Robin June 20 1997 Batman and Robin By JANET MASLIN t a gala in Gotham City the fabulous Poison Ivy makes her entrance in a fluffy magenta gorilla suit made from 450 Santa Claus wigs. Then she peels this off slowly as the band plays her theme song. And out comes the most show-stopping character in ""Batman and Robin"" the fourth and most frenetically gaudy feature in the series. As played by Uma Thurman Poison Ivy is perfect flaunting great looks a mocking attitude and madly flamboyant disguises. Like Mae West she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen. Poison Ivy captures the essence of ""Batman and Robin"" a wild campy costume party of a movie and the first ""Batman"" to suggest that somewhere in Gotham City there might be a Studio 54. Joel Schumacher director and ringmaster piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big bold noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible. In this context its not surprising that even the opening credit sequence is at fever pitch. The movie begins with Batman and Robin caught up in a crazed hockey match taking off on a rocket and then surfing through space. Aiming for comic book fans with a taste for heavy sarcasm and double-entendres the lavish ""Batman and Robin"" cares only about delivering nonstop glitter. In the interests of this it is more than happy to steamroller over questions of character and plotting. Theres not much more to Batman now played affably but blandly by George Clooney and given only second billing than a heroic jaw line understanding gaze and anatomically correct rubber suit. The mixed-up melancholy Batman of Tim Burtons first two films looks like the brooding Prince of Denmark next to this. What ""Batman and Robin"" does deliver is outlandish visual mischief and the more the merrier. The architecture of Gotham City now incorporates huge hunky male statuary and the local punks suggest ""A Clockwork Orange"" and heavy metal bands. Gotham throws a Save the Rainforest costume ball complete with extras doing a Polynesian dance number. Mr. Freeze the lumbering villain played by Arnold Schwarzenegger plus a 45-pound suit equipped with a couple of thousand tiny blue lights is the occasion for crazy experiments in icy decor. Since ""Batman and Robin"" does its best to throw in something for everyone theres even a dinosaur in one of these frosty scenes. Like ""Batman Forever"" the new film was directed fancifully by Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman (one of several ""Batman"" writers last time). Like ""Batman"" characters these two lead double lives they also collaborated on two John Grisham adaptations ""The Client"" and ""A Time to Kill"" which concern real people experiencing life without benefit of special effects. In other words theyre a lot smarter than say Mr. Freeze whose deadliest weapon in the film is an arsenal of har-har puns. Like ""Im afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas"" And ""You are not sending me to the cooler"" Schwarzenegger wears his armor manfully and delivers such lines with suitable smirks. And his Mr. Freeze is introduced as a former two-time Nobel Prize winner in molecular biology which is surely the funniest thing in the movie. But the ""Batman"" formula now works best when the characters like the filmmakers can be tongue-in-cheek. Certainly the brilliantly costumed Ms. Thurman is teasing as she plays a mousy botanist who becomes a glorious Venus flytrap and green-rights advocate. ""The time has come for plants to take back the world so rightfully ours"" she threatens while also denouncing Batman and Robin. (""Militant arm of the warm-blooded oppressors Animal protectors of the status quo"") On the other hand several of the films characters conspicuously fail to find the fun in their roles. After all the irony on display in ""Clueless"" Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl dully straight. And Clooney who does look ideal in the Batman outfit is often seen listening thoughtfully grinning ruefully and not knowing what to do next. The performance works well enough for the roles limited demands but Clooney doesnt seem to believe that a suave level-headed grown man might actually be Batman. Actually you cant really blame him for that. While the film veers recklessly from neo-""Triumph of the Will"" to Hong Kong action to anything else the traffic will bear -- and thats just in the opening hockey match -- it trots out a lively supporting cast. Elle Macpherson Vivica A. Fox and Vendela K. Thommessen supply window dressing in small roles while John Glover flames amusingly as the mad scientist who gives Ivy her start. Michael Gough harrumphs heartwarmingly through the role of Alfred the incredibly patient butler whose presence this time is milked to create a semblance of emotion. And Chris ODonnells Robin really deserves to have his name in the title giving a much better performance as his much-improved Robin slyly comes into his own. ""I want a Robin signal in the sky all right?"" he complains to Batman. ""Im tired of living in your shadow"" This time Robin shows how to succeed in ""Batman"" playing it straight while getting the joke. PRODUCTION NOTES Batman and Robin.
