We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren) the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penelope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.The biggest difference though is that almost 50 years later director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers including the late Anthony Minghella also stress the humour of Guidos philandering often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard who conveys the sadness of being  Guidos wife although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.

However It wasnt. Aside from the fact they completely missed the point the talents of the actors was wasted.

Do not bother with this one.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 24 2010MARIENFeaturedI havent seen such a rubbish film for a long time my friend booked it.It was a total waste of money if it shows on TV I dont think people will watch it. It has no story no event no progression; it gives an impression of emptiness it is slow. There are too many close up on D DL as if he was a grat hero; yes some of the scenes are beautiful  the ligting the props the rythm but it stops there the singing is awful.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 23 2010LizFeaturedYes stuff grated yes it seemed facile but want there a metaphor here.? The film derides what grated and is facile. I also think in the grated and facile there was a bit that alot of the woman who watched it would maybe privately like to be a bit of. I loved to see Judy Dench playing her role...sexy and sensible. As I left this film with my two girlfriends it generated a surprising amount of discussion. What is real anyway...the lead man was indulging the apparently unreal but was there a bigger metaphor to be appreciated here? Maybe it depends who is viewing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 22 2010JulesFeaturedloved itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 22 2010JulesFeaturedloved itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 20 2010CarmelFeaturedDont understand all the negative reviews its as if some people were at a different movie I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE going to see it again and plan to buy the DVD we need more movies like this simply outstandingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 20 2010CarmelFeaturedDont understand all the negative reviews its as if some people were at a different movie I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE going to see it again and plan to buy the DVD we need more movies like this simply outstandingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 18 2010RFeaturedNow I understand why this was a limited cinema release... What a rubbish film The plot made no sense amp; missed out all the good bits from the stage version. What a waste of a good cast I actually feel sorry for them On a plus note I loved Kate Hudsons song amp; Marillion Cotillard is always brilliant. Still though dont waste your money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 17 2010CappybearFeaturedA visual treat which seems better on reflection than it did at the time but which is let down by really weak songs. Penelope Cruz ought to be in the frame once more for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 16 2010GeorgeFeaturedThis movie was ravishing lovely well lit in fantastic locations and beautifully shot. Unfortunately however it was self indulgent crap Just like the movie within the movie it had almost no script. A huge let down for me. What on earth were actors of this stature and ability doing in such a crap movie? God alone only knows. Beautiful but utter rubbish in my view. Do not waste your money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 16 2010maxFeaturednice filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 6 2010TomeFeaturedMissO How can you say the actors cant sing? They sang very well. However that didnt save this movie from being one of the most boring of all time. I felt like falling asleep. Every cast member has a song which feels quite randomly put in. Awful film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 5 2010PaulFeaturedI went expecting not to like it but after a shakey start really enjoyed it with my partner. Such a strong cast and great songs and performances. Like Broken Embraces and Day For Night it is a film about film making and moves between fantasy and reality. After seeing the puerile tosh that was Avatar it was good to see something for grown-ups with a double digit reading age. Real actors with a good story and script - if you love cinema its history Fellini and this genre go see it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 4 2010MissOFeaturedI could not believe how bad this movie was. Huge disappointment. I give it a 20% for the gorgeous lightening in some scenes and a very sexy dance by Penelope Cruz (despite the strong mysogenist tone of the movie). But this does not save this movie which has not storyline whatsoever (youve seen in the trailer that it is about a director that has lost his passion well you wont get more than that) and is relying way too much on a famous names but not a good cast for this movie as none of the actors - except Fergie - can remotely sing. Daniel Day-Lewis should stick to his brilliant acting and never ever submit us to his atrocious singing. It was boring many people left during the movie and I would have done the same if it wasnt for me being stuck on one end of the row. Dont waste your time or money on this movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 2 2010streak100FeaturedI do not understand some of the stupid snobbish comments made about this film.We have just been to see it and found it quite superb in its filming and just plain entertaining.Quite what some of the reviewers are talking about I dont know and Im sure they dont either.Go and see this filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 1 2010AnnieD.FeaturedWell lots of work on the part of cast and crew. Its a shame that its all rather boring. DDL working too hard to be Italian and doesnt come close to Marcello. Where was the humour? Marion exquisite the cameraman loved you; Penelope fun and easy to watch but I missed Claudia; Nicole; cant understand the attraction; Fergie best actress w/o lines and a great ""Be Italian""; Judi always plays Judi; Kate Hudson; forgettaboit. Sophia ah Sophia. What pleasure you gave us all. Dont resent you taking the part but we need to let you grow old and perhaps you need to let yourself. Some good numbers but mediocre cinema easily forgotten. Not entirely a waste of my APS9. but could have spent it on something more worthwhile.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 31 2009LaurenFeaturedUnfortunately I cant review this one properly because I fell asleep.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 31 2009LivFeaturedWhat a let down. This film is tedious and at best self indulgent. Fergie manages to out act all the actresses (and she doesnt even have any lines) Nicole Kidman had to have the key of her song changed so its turned into a dirge Day-Lewis is Day-Lewis with a funny walk and different costume Cotillard was decent Sophia Loren almost sent me screaming (that woman looks terrifying) and the story was just a bit pathetic. An egotistical man comes to terms with his egotistical ways and goes through an egotistical trip to find redemption... disgustingly he does- and were supposed to feel pleased for this revolting man... Kidmans character Claudia says these women arent real- its the only true moment in the film. I was so depressed coming out- the trailer had looked so good and Ive been a fan of the music for a while. I wish they had just got some musical theatre actresses for it instead of names. Im giving it one star due to bad story poorly written characters star casting without thought to quality and for just taking over an hour of my life away from me. BoooFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009KateFeaturedNowhere near as good as the promo clip made it seem. Wait for it to come out on dvd. Fergie and Cotillard were pretty much the only good things in it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009usman khawajaFeaturedi loved coutillard as the deceived wife -and there is one great scene in the movie where she confronts lewis at a screen test-other than that the style is great and so are the costumes and choreography -but the script is dull -dench and loren are wasted - kidman comes turns right and left and twirls around and vanishes -DDL is not really a convincing fellini by any count -if he is playing the marstro as he is supposed to -its ok but disappoints overall -cruz was just cruising DDL -FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2009ColinFeaturedThis is close to being amasterpiece. Day-Lewis is on Oscar winning form as he succincylt plays the emptiness of the singing dick. Guido knows nothing acccept hedonistic sexual betrayal. The film interweaves memory self-pity with the experiences of the women who Guido loved but did not love at all. All the supporting cast are great but Judi Dench proves that she can still do it - any genre any time any age. What a babe. Not quite a masterpiece because of its slight self indulgency bu the best fun at the movies in 2009.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2009sashaFeaturedSadly very disappointing- dont waste your money if its a musical you want. songs and singing were terrible. what was Dame Judi Dench doing in this Very weak plot of a womanising director who had lost the plot lots of chain smoking and shots of him as a fledgling about to be lothario. all those big names didnt make this film interesting for me and I went home yearning to play Cabaret or some decent musical.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 12 2009LonellFeaturedThis film is nothing short of a masterpiece. Its like a dreamscape of fantasy and memory merged with the harsh reality of devastingly broken relationships. Every member of this cast is used beautifully and bring their personal stories to each of these characters. It looks and feels beautiful I cannot believe most American reviewers arent embracing it.

Ahh. Flash bulbs and flesh. Ooh. While youre at it add a ""lah-lah."" Welcome to a Christmas release Italian style. ""Nine"" an homage to Federico Fellinis masterpiece ""8 1/2"" is rife with leggy women and low-cut views. Indeed the ample decolletage lovingly surveyed in Rob Marshalls zesty version of Arthur L. Kopit and Maury Yestons Tony-winning musical (adapted by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella) recalls the famous photo of Sophia Loren eyeing Jayne Mansfields plunging neckline at Romanoffs restaurant in 1957. Perfect then that Loren plays one of the nine muses to the movies flailing Apollo director Guido Contini. She appears as the directors Mamma whom he failed nearly as much as he did the church with his randy imagination. Portrayed by Daniel Day- Lewis Guido often is treated like a god by adoring fans from cardinals to shopkeepers. Only at the start of ""Nine"" mere mortals are beginning to pose questions. ""Are you running out of ideas?"" a reporter asks amid a seizure-inducing strobe at a press conference. Its the kind of query sure to erect a creative block as big as Mount Olympus. ""Nine"" reveals the mind and revels in the makeup of an artist trying to scale that edifice. In addition to Loren the film features Penelope Cruz Marion Cotillard Kate Hudson Nicole Kidman Judi Dench and Stacy ""Fergie"" Ferguson of the Black Eyed Peas. It is a beautiful talented bevy. And ""Nine"" is if not a grand work terrifically tasty eye and ear candy. Two numbers -- from somewhat unexpected quarters -- are worth the price of admission alone. Like Fellinis 1963 movie ""Nine"" muses more than it marches with deliberate rhythms. Its strange to find director Marshalls other play- to-screen musical ""Chicago"" a surer movie experience than this work which is so much about the cinema. ""Nine"" is a film of sustained moments. Early on we get a sense of the complicated cad Guido can be. After he flees not just the press conference but Rome where he was to begin shooting his lastest film he calls wife Luisa (played with warmth by Cotillard; inspired by Giulietta Masina). Hiding out in a flush hotel he begs her to come to him. She takes the bait. As soon as she does he changes his mind. He invites his mistress. Cruz plays Carla. By turns demanding and beseeching shes married too. Cruzs other-woman turn is not played for judgment. Like Guido this film loves its women. Hudson is a revelation as Stephanie the Vogue reporter. Not since her breakthrough role in ""Almost Famous"" has Hudson been so commanding. And like that character this one has a bit of the groupie in her. As Saraghina the crazed earthy prostitute young Guido and his herd of friends are obsessed with Fergies rendition of ""Be Italian"" rumbles like a train through a tunnel before tambourines and Bob Fosse- like moves make the numbers arrival jaw-dropping. Its as addictive a big Broadway song as one could hope for. For the quietly exquisitely cinematic theres the first of two Cotillard numbers ""My Husband Makes Movies."" (The other is a quasi strip tease called ""Take It All."") While Guidos exhausted mate sings this resigned ballad we watch her first screen test with ""the Maestro."" A final image of their initial movie magic together before she became his adored star and long before she became his neglected wife is a keen articulation of the romantic memories on which marital longevity is (or is not) built. Dion Beebes cinematography is wickedly fluid. Ditto the editing especially in Kate Hudsons wham-bam sock-it- to-us number ""Cinema Italiano"" one of three new songs written by Yeston for the film. Day-Lewis is soulfully spot on when it comes to Guidos angst with his situational morals. But we ached for more joyous notes yes even in their misery during his songs. Kidmans character the actress Claudia says it best. Standing in a fountain evoking Anita Ekbergs romp in ""La Dolce Vita"" she quizzes Guido about his elusive script. ""And these muses they fall in love with the man?"" she asks. He answers in the affirmative. ""Id rather be the man"" she says. ""NINE."" PG-13 for sexual content and smoking. 2 hours 20 minutes. Directed by Rob Marshall; written by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella; based on the Broadway musical ""Nine"" with book by Arthur L.

Filmmakers block Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) agonizes over starting his new movie in Guidos Song. ABOUT THE MOVIENine  (out of four)Stars Daniel Day-Lewis Penelope Cruz Marion Cotillard Nicole Kidman Sophia Loren Judi Dench Kate Hudson Stacy FergusonDirector Rob MarshallDistributor The Weinstein Co.Rating PG-13 for sexual content and smoking Running time 1 hour 59 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Wed all like to live in an Italian movie. So says a character in Nine and its probably the best line in this musical misfire. Nine has glamour. Rome looks fabulous as does Daniel Day-Lewis zipping around in his Fiat in dark shades skinny tie and slicked-back hair. But theres no substance beneath the gloss. For an homage to director Federico Fellini who made such psychologically complex and poetic films its surprisingly vapid. VIDEO Watch the trailer Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) has adapted the 1982 Broadway musical based on Fellinis seminal 1963 film 81/2. But rather than capturing the neo-realist directors singularly offbeat vision he peppers the film with superficial images from Fellinis work. Day-Lewis plays Guido Contini a filmmaker who is creatively blocked. Distracted and anxious he dallies with his mistress (Penelope Cruz) reassures his wife (Marion Cotillard) placates his producer (Ricky Tognazzi) and seeks inspiration from his muse (Nicole Kidman). He takes refuge in reverie even turning to his dead mother (Sophia Loren) and influential memories from his youth. Youll hear his first name repeated -- mostly in song -- about 50 times as if absorbing it will give a deeper sense of him. The dialogue is surprisingly lackluster given that the screenplay was written by Michael Tolkin (The Player) and the late Anthony Minghella (The English Patient). And then theres the music. The cast members musical talents are markedly uneven. Day-Lewis Italian accent works in speech but when he sings he sounds strangely like the Count from Sesame Street. The best performers are Cotillard (who won an Oscar portraying Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose) and Stacy Ferguson (aka Fergie) whose powerful voice works well in a small but distinctive part as sensuous Saraghina. Judi Dench as Continis costume designer sings capably in a French accent in her Folies Bergere-inspired number. Cruz does a steamy song and dance but her acting is strangely caricatured. Kate Hudson appears in over her head in her extravagant musical sequence and Sophia Loren talk-sings her role. Unlike Chicago there are no showstopping musical numbers here. It takes a couple viewings/listenings to appreciate -- or even distinguish -- its songs. (Be Italian is the most notable.) Nine should have been called 41/2 because it doesnt come close to the work of the master who inspired it.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Nine Free Video Rated PG-13  2009 Not to be confused with Shane Ackers dismal animation 9 this is another razzmatazz musical adapted by Rob Marshall (Chicago) from a Broadway show. The title is a reference to Fellinis 8 1/2 and the main character is an Italian film director (Daniel Day-Lewis) whos struggling to pull together a self-referential art-house epic in the supercool 60s as his wife (Marion Cotillard) and his mistress (Penelope Cruz) compete for his attention. With its stagy dance numbers this reminded me more of Bob Fosses confessional musical All That Jazz (1979) than 8 1/2 though it suffers from comparison to either given that Marshall is several steps removed from Fellinis feverish self-investigation. Its a movie about a musical about a movie about a mans inner life--surely we can eliminate some of the middle men. With Judi Dench Nicole Kidman Sophia Loren Kate Hudson and Fergie whose patronizing number ""Be Italian"" has become the movies marketing hook. PG-13. By J.R.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Nine amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Invictus Avatar >> Nine Movie makers place themselves on a pedestal next to messiahs politicians and rock stars--people who are forgiven (or even loved) for their sins. Sometimes they deserve it. Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) doesnt. Neither does director Rob Marshall. Yet both approach their latest projects with audacity yet no reason to exist. Contini was once a major force--right around the time when he married his muse Luisa (Marion Cotillard excellent). His last few films were flops and the industry is clamoring for him to make another--pressing him so hard in fact he starts shooting in days but still hasnt written the script. Instead like a petulant child he decides to go into hiding with his latest mistress (a wild and bawdy Penelope Cruz) but his entourage tracks him down by sunset. Seamstress Judi Dench star Nicole Kidman and Vogue reporter Kate Hudson are desperate for the genius to create. We arent. To us hes just a selfish child with too many decades and artistry removed from his originator Federico Fellini. Fellini modeled Guido on himself. That version of the truth was shaped by his own 81/2 then reshaped again to fit the stage before being slapped here. Where Fellini dared us to race alongside his imagination Marshall is thuddingly cautious. Hes so worried about audiences resisting the fantasy of musicals he has to set all of his ballads not just in the singers head but on a stage inside their head as if to say ""Dont worry folks People arent really singing their feelings--this is theatrical"" The best number ""Be Italian"" belongs to Fergie who allegedly packed on pounds for her 6 minutes as the whore Saraghina. Boy are those curves worth every bite--Marshall shoots the female figure with awe and every breast leg and hip is so statuesque it could have been carved in marble. Less thrilling is what passes for a lesson the idea that every great man deserves forgiveness if he keeps creating his art. Call it the Polanski defense. And boy does it feel cheap.

Nine Bad to fair Director Rob Marshall. Cast Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz. Rating Rated PG-13 for sexual content and smoking. RELATED Cotillard pushed herself into music of Nine Penelope Cruz ranges from drama to dance Theres perfect harmony among the all-star cast of Nine Nine ladies kick up their heels for Fellini Loren and 9 other mature beauties Spotlight Daniel Day-Lewis Musicals From stage to film The cast includes Daniel Day-Lewis (two Oscars) Marion Cotillard (Oscar winner) Penelope Cruz (Oscar winner) Nicole Kidman (Oscar winner) Judi Dench (Oscar winner) and Sophia Loren (Oscar winner); Fergie and Kate Hudson are wandering around in there as well. Surely theyve won something or other somewhere along the line too. Thats a whole lot of hardware. Maybe its too much of a good thing too much talent for director Rob Marshall to get a handle on. The film based on the musical which is in turn based on Federico Fellinis ""8 1/2"" - yes movie based on musical based on film - has some entertaining set pieces (the women get solos; Cotillard gets two) but it plays more like the most-expensive variety show ever produced than a full-on movie. Like Fellinis film ""Nine"" is about the struggle of famed Italian director Guido (Day-Lewis) who is supposed to be making his ninth film but who busies himself with smoking escaping and having various affairs. His long-suffering wife Luisa (Cotillard) is aware of his philandering and as a former actress of his talent. Carla (Cruz) is his enthusiastic mistress their affair an open secret. Claudia (Kidman) is his muse Lilli (Dench) his costume designer. Stephanie (Hudson) is a fashion reporter (the media is surprisingly interested in Guidos next film; he hosts press conferences to not talk about it). His late mother (Loren) appears to him in visions while Saraghina (Fergie) a prostitute from his youth lives in his memories. No wonder Guido cant get anything done. Thats a lot to pack into a life much less a two-hour movie. Some of the performances are good -Cotillard in particular is outstanding - but the overwhelming sensation while watching is to want to smack Guido upside the head and say ""Look Bub stop blabbering about how hard it is to make your movie and make it already."" Day-Lewis is a great actor maybe the best working today. If he cant make an audience sympathize with his character or at least have some connection to him its pretty much a lost cause. If the songs were more memorable the prudent thing to do would be to simply buy the soundtrack. But theyre no great shakes either. As it stands ""Nine"" is a movie with a ton of talent without an effective way to channel it. Heres wishing Guido better luck on ""Ten."" Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Rob Marshalls first musical since ""Chicago is ""Nine. Its based on a 1982 Tony-winning show which was based on ""8 1/2 Federico Fellinis iconic 47-year-old ode to himself and to Italian decadence. Marshalls movie is the Olive Garden version. You can easily imagine the movies catchiest song ""Be Italian used to sell bowls of spaghetti.While ""Chicago won the best-picture Oscar and rekindled enthusiasm for movie musicals ""Nine is full of the same mistakes Marshall made then. The numbers are locked away from the rest of the narrative action so the songs exist only in a kind of secret-fantasy thought bubble. The editing murders all the logic of the choreography. The camera shoots too many sequences from dubious positions ""Be Italian featuring the big-throated belter Fergie and a score of scantily clad dancers has been photographed from behind an assortment of props (is that a branch?). Its like having somebody in a huge hat sit right down in front of you only worse The director put that guy there.Loosely adapted by Anthony Minghella and Michael Tolkin ""Nine is meant to be a voluptuous tribute to one heterosexual moviemakers voracious appetite for women. As played by a thin cerebral Daniel Day-Lewis he seems like a vegetarian to me. His character a famed filmmaker named Guido Contini is coming off a critical and commercial flop. Hes already holding press conferences for his highly anticipated follow-up which has no script. It does have a theme ""Italia - ""as a myth as a woman as a dream or something to that effect. The movie is full of risible pontifications about the nature of art but falls well short of capturing the angst of creative frustration.Guido leaves the paparazzi of Rome for a peaceful villa to write but still has to juggle the women in both his daily life and his memories. His amorous mistress (Penelope Cruz) shows up desperate for more of him than she can have. His long-suffering wife (Marion Cotillard) wants more of him too. His costume designer (Judi Dench) contributes her admittedly valuable two cents. His muse (Nicole Kidman) refuses to begin shooting until she has a script to read. Fergie shows up in a flashback as the beachcombing hooker who introduced young Guido and his friends to the joys of - let me see rubbing sand on your breasts? And once or twice a nicely upholstered Sophia Loren appears as Guidos late mother to offer posthumous advice.Most of the women pull into view strut their stuff then more or less vanish. This was essentially true of the show as well. But in the 2003 Broadway revival there was intensity in the actors playing these roles - anger fire lust exasperation bitterness - which is missing from this movie. A musical needs stars who want to knock you out. Jane Krakowski who played Cruzs part in the revival probably isnt a star because shes always so needily on. Thats a nerdy theater trait that movie stars are too cool for. But on stage the need to wow is exciting. Catherine Zeta-Jones was hungry that way in ""Chicago and she was the best thing in the movie. In this film of ""Nine the prevailing cool is lethal.Numbers that should bring down the house just feel banal. Cruz is required to literalize an obscene phone call thrusting her butt at the camera and massaging her crotch all while wearing lingerie and sitting in a swing. Later Cotillard gives us a striptease version of Cruzs burlesque. For an actor this might be liberating - or at least fun. At the movies sequences like these are enticing but familiar like the Oscar winners edition of one of those Victorias Secret specials.No one fares as badly as Kate Hudson. She plays a writer for a fashion magazine who comes on to Guido. The punishment for her aggression is the films new song by the original musicals creator Maury Yeston. Its a brightly lit horns-and go-go number called ""Cinema Italiano and Hudson channeling both ""Austin Powers and her mothers ""Laugh-In years cant seem to keep up with the rush of embarrassing lyrics (""Those scenes I love to see/ from Guidos POV) or nail the swinging choreography.Pieces of the movie work. Dench in both speech and song is wonderful. The stick-on French accent she uses in her cabaret number (she gives her rs a good Eartha Kitt roll) has all the humor and vitality you could ask for. Kidman has a dreary song thats poorly staged (not the back of her head again please) but she also gets to speak with a womanly wisdom I had never heard from her. And Cruz gives the movies most complete performance trading the spiteful envy of being the other woman for genuine sadness.Shes so good you forget the man sharing her scenes. Day-Lewis does get in a decent workout. He supplies Guido with intellect cunning and great blasts of nervous energy. However whats missing from the performance - and from the entire movie - is sex. Marcello Mastroianni starred for Fellini. Raul Julia originated the part on Broadway and Antonio Banderas starred in the revival. Those are men who smolder. Im sure it was a thrill to get Day-Lewis to commit to this part and should someone want to film another ""Sweeney Todd hes probably your man. But a role about a slutty moviemaker needs a libidinous star. The glamour is authentic if complacently so. Marshall has assembled all these great stars and makes them work but he doesnt build much entertainment from all their effort. The script thins out the psychological tether that binds Guido to the women in his life - the closest we get is the stunning fact that Guidos mistress (Cruz) is a younger version of his mother (Loren). And only about half the shows songs are used so the ones that are here become less storytelling devices and more performance platforms. The way in which the women arrive and then more or less disappear is like the Hollywood issue of Vanity Fair Each star has a wow photo the movie turns the page and its on to the next.Indeed the movie ends by juxtaposing glossy clips with black-and-white footage from the films rehearsals so we see for instance a sweaty Dame Judi taking a breather. All thats missing is an editors letter saying ""See you at the Oscars. Not if were lucky.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 26 2009 -- 556pm David James Photo Credit David James Lilli (Judi Dench) and Showgirls perform ""Folies Bergere"" (Musical Number) in Rob Marshalls NINE. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Nine"" opens with Fellini-esque Italian director Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) lamenting the fragility of the visions he strives to capture on celluloid. ""You kill your film several times mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down you kill it with a camera. The film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it but then it dies again buried in film cans."" Prophetic words. ""Nine"" expires in every sluggish graceless scene. Based on the 1982 musical about a creatively blocked auteur the film aspires to be a dark fantasia like Bob Fosses ""All That Jazz"" or director Rob Marshalls own ""Chicago."" But those films follow characters in life-and-death predicaments. Guidos just stuck for an idea. Day-Lewis hunches his shoulders crams his fists in his pockets and scowls like Ralph Fiennes passing a kidney stone; his creative crisis comes across as self-glorifying masochistic mush. Hes an actor of prodigious gifts but hes on the wrong frequency here tight and dry in a role that begs for slapstick fury and comic-strip craziness. Wracking his brain for inspiration Guido drifts into reveries about the most important women in his life. Enter his superstar muse his mama his mistress an Earth mother from his childhood his wry costume designer a predatory reporter and last and least his neglected wife. The roles go to a crazy salad of actresses Judi Dench and Kate Hudson Fergie and Marion Cotillard together at last Each actress gets an overblown number to convey the nature of her relationship to Il Maestro. The chopped-up editing cant improve set pieces staged like an archaic big-musical circus. The weakly written songs tromp across the screen like a mule team. Cotillard must inject feeling into ""My husband makes movies/ To make them he lives a kind of dream/ In which his actions arent always what they seem"" To speak such lines let alone sing them would test any actress mettle. David James Photo Credit David James Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) agonizes over starting his new film in a scene from Rob Marshalls NINE ""Guidos Song"" (Musical Number). Penelope Cruz playing Guidos trampy tender-hearted mistress has the best turn in the spotlight aided by sexy choreography and a bejeweled bikini more memorable than any of the songs. Most of the high-priced stardust is irritating. The film ricochets from Guidos frantic production meetings and clandestine trysts to his fantasies and one cancels out the other. At least it looks great with characters whizzing around breathtaking locales on Vespas or in trim little Alfa Romeos. There are sensuously photographed sequences in black-and-white neo-realist style and the close-fitting costumes are elegant. Shuffling characters around to create the impression of action Marshall doesnt seem able to pull together the elements of filmmaking. There are many ways to kill a film; death by ennui is surely the most painful.

Nine Movie review Daniel Day-Lewis Penelope Cruz dont add up to much in Nine Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 25 2009 ""Nine"" bounces into theaters as a bright shiny bauble of cinematic self-reference and mythologizing begging so insistently to be loved that it winds up pushing the audience away. Rob Marshalls frantic fussy adaptation of the Broadway musical -- which itself was an adaptation of a classic film -- suffers all the distortion that its hall-of-mirrors provenance suggests. Its a film within a film about a film within a film and seems to lose layers of authenticity with each iteration finally becoming a profoundly alienating experience. This StoryRazzle-dazzle beauties kick up their heels for FelliniWatch the Nine trailerNine Music lyrics and stars dont add up to muchFind Nine showtimesView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story ""Nine"" is about Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) a legendary Italian filmmaker who in 1965 on the eve of directing his latest picture finds himself creatively blocked and preoccupied with the women in his life madonnas and whores alike. An insurmountable flaw of ""Nine"" is that it asks viewers so blithely to identify with a protagonist whose overwhelming ego insecurity and selfishness theyre meant to confuse with artistic genius. Guido of course was invented by Federico Fellini in his 1963 movie ""8 1/2 "" a semi-autobiographical reverie on art sex obsession and forgiveness. But the characters and material that in Fellinis hands made for such a delicate funny and self-aware meditation become in ""Nine"" a meaningless exercise in style for its own sake whipped by Marshall into a nearly incomprehensible froth. Its a measure of how disjointed the movie is that when a reel was shown out of order at a recent screening no one appeared to notice. The grabber about ""Nine"" is that it stars Nicole Kidman PenA(c)lope Cruz Marion Cotillard and Kate Hudson some of the screens hottest actresses in both meanings of that word. Judi Dench and Sophia Loren are also on hand to lend gravitas as well as Fergie the pop-star outlier who delivers one of many brassy bawdy set pieces as a prostitute from Guidos past. Where that number goes out of its way to be sexually aggressive by far the most crassly erotic performance goes to Cruz who as Guidos mistress sings an ode to carnality using two ropes as the rough analogue to a strippers pole. Every actress gets her moment each with a song that is more instantly forgettable than the last. In ""Chicago"" and ""Dreamgirls"" Marshall proved that he doesnt know how to film dancers compulsively cutting away from movement rather than letting it play. Oddly Marshalls edit-happy style matters less with ""Nine"" which doesnt feature dancing so much as metrically timed writhing stomping sashaying and posing. (The ""Glee"" kids would call it ""hairography."") Day-Lewiss singing voice is undistinguished but his spoken voice with its silken lower registers is seductively musical; still he cant imbue much interest in a portrait of the artist as a raging -- and aging -- narcissist. Of all his gorgeous co-stars Cotillard alone delivers something that resembles a true performance in a smoldering heartbreaking turn as Guidos long-suffering wife. Cotillards moments slow the proceedings a bit inviting viewers to contemplate a fleeting view of genuine human vulnerability. As for the rest of ""Nine"" its crammed and crazy and ultimately kind of craven baiting filmgoers with star power and showstoppers and delivering little more than pastiche. Heres an idea To experience all the joys of ""Nine"" do yourself a favor and rent ""8 1/2 "" and ""All That Jazz."" Pop some popcorn plump up the couch cushions and settle in for a delicious dazzling night at the movies.  PG-13. At area theaters.

Review Nine 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Nine Drama. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz Kate Hudson and Nicole Kidman. Directed by Rob Marshall. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The failure of ""Nine"" is complete and has many causes. The material itself presented problems. Though the original musical is from the 1980s and based on Federico Fellinis 1963 classic ""8 1/2"" the mind-set feels achingly 70s Its the story of Guido a film director who lies to his women and cheats on them - and yet were supposed to think of him as adorable and to see his transgressions as evidence of his restless creativity. Half the movie takes place in the central characters mind. The music is indifferent and the lyrics border on awful - everyone keeps singing about ""Guido."" So this time director Rob Marshall clearly had his work cut out for him. His last musical ""Chicago"" had us at hello with a catchy opening number ""All that Jazz"" followed by a succession of fun songs and vivid characters. This movie has sad-sack chain-smoking Guido moping around with writers block. But Marshall compounds his problems. First he casts Daniel Day-Lewis in a role previously played by Marcello Mastroianni onscreen and Raul Julia onstage men who were 10 years younger and more visceral in quality. To be a bad boy at 40 is stretching it but if you look at Mastroianni its understandable Women keep throwing themselves at him so what can he do? But to be out of control of your emotional and sexual life at 50 - to be lying and sneaking around - is neither cool nor interesting. It makes a man pathetic. Plus Day-Lewis has never looked so creepy. His idea of playing Italian is to walk around hunched over not shave and smoke constantly What difference does it make if Guido straightens out his life when he looks as if hes going to be dead soon? Then he sings but he doesnt sound Italian. He sounds like Bela Lugosi. But Day-Lewis cant take the fall for this alone. Another huge problem is that Marshall imports a strategy he used in ""Chicago"" that simply does not work here. In ""Nine"" all the songs take place in an imaginary world. When the songs begin the camera moves to a stage set and we see the featured character in a production number accompanied by dancers. Now in ""Chicago"" that approach was fine for two reasons 1. The songs were real expressions of what the characters were thinking; and 2. The songs moved the story along. They were active. They paralleled stuff going on in the real world so that by the time a song was over the story would be advanced if only a little bit. But in ""Nine"" neither of these is the case. Most of the numbers dont express what the characters are thinking. They express what Guido thinks the characters are thinking and for a great artist he doesnt have much of an imagination. Also because they really are just musical versions of his ruminations theyre static in terms of story. Each time someone sings one of these awful songs the movie comes to a crashing halt. Nor does it help that Marshall films most of the dance numbers in a kind of murky haze meant to parallel one might guess Guidos emotional state. Heres a guarantee Within 30 minutes of ""Nine"" you will really be sick of Guidos emotional state. However two numbers are worth saving from the fire. As Guidos mistress Penelope Cruz performs ""A Call From the Vatican"" and she is so sexy that I actually felt embarrassed watching her as if I were 14. And as Guidos wife Marion Cotillard brings a world of feeling to ""Take It All"" the only genuinely good song in the musical. Cotillard in fact is so good throughout ""Nine"" - so warm so clearly suffering with this awful husband - that shes almost a problem. She makes you hate Guido or rather hate him even more. Everybody else survives though we have to root for them and ignore the lyrics Nicole Kidman as a sex goddess Sophia Loren as Guidos mother Fergie as an Italian prostitute Judi Dench as a designer Kate Hudson as a journalist - all of them mere adjuncts and stations in the development of the glorious Guido. John Lennon once said ""Theres a great woman behind every idiot."" This time Im counting seven of them. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and Penelope Cruz dancing in a way that can turn men into boys and boys into men.

Rarely have so many Oscar-winners struggled so strenuously for such meager payoff.The cast is a dream. Daniel Day-Lewis plays the spidery Guido Contini celebrated tale-spinner maker of stylish movies and catcher of sensual women.With great fanfare Guido announces his ninth feature (hence the films title) the grandly titled epic Italia. Directorially speaking he has performance anxiety. Not unlike the movie Guido is trapped in he lacks a script.To get his juices flowing in his mind Guido invokes the women who nurture and coddle him among them his mother (Sophia Loren) mistress (PenA(c)lope Cruz) muse (Nicole Kidman) and wife (Marion Cotillard).But they are so much more obedient in Guidos dreams than they are in real life where they refuse to stay in the compartments to which hes relegated them. Like so many men Guido cant reconcile the contradiction that dream women take direction and real women give it.Marshalls handsomely wrought film aims to show how artists spin gold from such straw. But the movie which costars Judi Dench as Guidos costumer/confidante Kate Hudson as a journalist/groupie and Fergie (of the Black Eyed Peas) as the earthiest of prostitutes is essentially a girlie show purveying the seven flavors of womanhood from madonna to whore.Here Marshall who enjoyed a freshman triumph with Chicago and endured a sophomore slump with Memoirs of a Geisha doesnt so much build a musical drama as wrangle an indifferently paced variety show. Theres little modulation to the musical numbers most of which boast bump-and-grind choreography common to music videos and gentlemans-club revues. (It doesnt help the cause that Maury Yestons songs are more functional than fun.) Without much in the way of musical or dramatic foreplay the film gyrates from climax to climax.Given its luscious cast and lush cinematography (which segues from arty black-and-white to voluptuous color and not always because the monochrome suggests reality and color dream) Nine is gorgeous to look at. And despite the films overall failure to cohere Day-Lewis Cotillard and Dench powerfully act their songs giving a taste of the film that might have been - had their costars been directed to follow their example.(Cruz as Guidos mistress Carla exemplifies everything that is wrong with the film as a movie and right with her number as a stand-alone segment In the carnal carnivalesque ""A Phone Call From the Vatican"" she licks her lips parts her legs and vamps vamps vamps.)In Rex Harrison-speaksong Day-Lewis intones ""Guidos Song"" (""My bodys clearing 40 as my mind is nearing 10"") lucidly expressing his characters problem. Cotillard so terrific as Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose might be even better here as the aggrieved wife who becomes the burlesque queen of her husbands nightmares.It is a mark of Cotillards power and dignity that in ""Take It All"" a strip number that owes a debt to Rita Hayworths ""Put the Blame on Mame"" in Gilda she peels off a glove chastising her spouse ""You got your wish / You got your prize / Now take it right between your thighs"" and makes the clumsy lyric oddly eloquent. Would that this could be said of the rest of the film.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Both a remake of Federico Fellinis masterpiece 8 1/2 and a screen version of the Maury Yeston musical which won the Tony Award twice this new film will probably appeal most to those without strong feelings about either of its sources. Movie Information NineRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Rob MarshallActors Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Nicole Kidman Penelope Cruz Judi Dench Sophia Loren Kate Hudson Stacy FergusonRun time 113 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sexual content and smoking)Synopsis Daniel Day-Lewis and fellow Oscar winners star in a musical based on Fellinis 8 1/2.More movies from GuideLive.comClassic-movie buffs might find the many images directly purloined from the Fellini original (let alone some of the switches and simplifications in the plot) a desecration. Fans of the musical will almost certainly miss a favorite song since director Rob Marshall uses little more than half the original score (though Yeston has written three new numbers for the film).Still to the open-minded Nine can be fascinating. It follows Fellinis basic story closely. Daniel Day-Lewis plays an Italian director struggling to make a new film. The demands of the many women in his life are a major distraction.Count the Oscar winners among them Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose ) plays his wife Penelope Cruz (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) his mistress Nicole Kidman (The Hours) the star of his movie. Judi Dench is the longtime collaborator whose shoulder he cries on Sophia Loren his mother (dead but always in his thoughts) Kate Hudson a young writer with a yen for him Fergie the remembered prostitute that first fired him up erotically.The performances are all outstanding even better than those in Marshalls Oscar-winning Chicago. Although most of the stars are not known as singers the musical numbers generally strike pay dirt too. As in Chicago Marshall has divorced them completely from the movies real-time action. Instead they take place on an empty movie set - and in Guidos hyperactive imagination.The director obviously chose songs with the greatest potential for big production numbers. Perhaps surprisingly Dame Judi has the best of all. Those who know her only for her serious dramatic roles are in for a surprise and a treat. In impeccable French (although the character shes playing is British) Dench belts powerfully flirts shamelessly and shows off gams remarkable for someone 75.Hudson gets the other outstanding number Yestons new ""Cinema Italiano."" The star leads a sexy bunch of go-go dancers as she shimmies and struts a personification of the sexual revolution.One of the keys to Nines special flavor is the way all that musical sexiness butts up against the tortured psyches of the main characters. Day-Lewis always good at twisted and intense adds a dose of wry humor. Cotillard looking a little young as the wife (once Guidos star) is heartbreaking in the remembered scene when the two first meet during a screen test. Cruz so sexy in the bedroom scene modeled shot-for-shot on 8 1/2 is even more effective when distraught.On second thought fans of the Fellini film and the original Yeston musical absolutely need to see the new Nine.

"Nine What it lacks in logic it makes up in style | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNine What it lacks in logic it makes up in styleShut up and eat your ice cream.Penelope Cruzs number in Nine dazzlingly sexy.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 24 2009 Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz Judi Dench Nicole Kidman Kate Hudson Sophia Loren and Fergie. Directed by Rob Marshall. 119 minutes. Opens Dec. 25. At major theatres. PG Shut up and eat your ice cream.Wait I kid and I quote.Article Continued BelowThe ice-cream line is from the uppity producer character in 8 1/2 the surreal 1963 Fellini film that begat the 1982 Broadway musical Nine so named because songwriter Maury Yeston thought his tunes deserved a half nod in the title. Now Nine is an engaging musical film directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and scripted by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella (his final work) from Arthur L. Kopits stage book.But to get back to that petulant producer His ice-cream snipe is what he hurls at a bimbo starlet who is getting on his nerves. It serves as excellent counsel for the enjoyment of Nine a fractured film about creative and coital conundrums that is best sampled like an array of Italian gelatos. In other words dont complain about how it all works just enjoy the yummy bits.There are plenty of them mainly the songs by Kate Hudson and Marion Cotillard but lets get what plot there is out of the way first. Daniel Day-Lewis is Guido Contini a Fellini-esque moviemaker in mid-1960s Rome whose best work is behind him as everybody keep reminding him. We meet this rogue charmer ""Maestro"" as hes known as hes giving a press conference in Romes Cinecitta Film Studios explaining to bewildered journos how you ""kill"" your movies in the process of making them.The Maestro could be referring to himself. On the cusp of 50 Guido is in the midst of a full-blown midlife crisis more from his inability to keep his pants on than writers block. Rather than begin the epic film Italia that is to be his latest and greatest project once again starring his sultry muse Claudia (Nicole Kidman) he flees Rome in his vintage convertible Alfa Romeo. He takes refuge in a swank seaside resort where there is more marble than the Vatican and more spirits than a graveyard.Here Guido like Dickens Scrooge must confront his past present and future - but Scrooge was fortunate in only having to deal with ghosts. Guidos vexations are all flesh-and-blood although some of them - notably Sophia Loren as his mother - also appear in his vivid fantasies. He begins his follies by foolishly inviting both his wife (Marion Cotillard) and his lover (Penelope Cruz) to join him.Marshalls casting is the real draw of Nine. With the exception of Loren none of his choices are Italian which could have been a liability in the hands of a less creative director. Daniel Day-Lewis makes for a game Guido but not a perfect one the way Marcello Mastroianni was for 8 1/2. Day-Lewiss Italian accent is at best serviceable and his singing leaves something to be desired - which may explain why his two numbers are rushed and crushed. Day-Lewis was chosen for his acting ability not his song-and-dancemanship and he barely gets away with it. Marshall (and his editor) made a dancer out Richard Gere for Chicago but he cant quite make a singer of Day-Lewis for Nine.The same must be said of Judi Dench who as Guidos costume designer and personal nag Lilli vamps ""Folies Bergere"" in an ill-advised and incongruous number that services no fantasies and adds nothing to the proceedings. When inspiration strikes it does so as lightning. Kate Hudson stuns in her big-production number ""Cinema Italiano"" shimmying and smiling her way through a tribute to the Maestros cinematic achievements the musical high point of Nine. Who knew that Hudson had such great pipes?Cruz also dazzles with her sexy number ""A Call From the Vatican"" which is anything but religious.Equally impressive although on a downbeat note is Marion Cotillards ""My Husband Makes Movies"" and the new ""Take It All"" two songs that buttress the films meandering cheated-spouse narrative.Somewhere between okay and what-the? are the songs-and-dances by the Black Eyed Peas Fergie Kidman and Loren.Lensing was split between Italian locales and Englands Shepperton Studios and the latter shows in the slightly claustrophobic feel of several of the musical numbers. When cinematographer Dion Beebe is allowed to cut loose he delivers sweeping scenery that could have you breaking into your own chorus of ""Be Italian.""The one thing really missing from Nine is a consistent sense of fun. Legend has it Fellini filmed 8 1/2 with a note reading ""Remember its a comedy"" taped to his camera. Marshall and Day-Lewis might have profited from that example. The math on Nine doesnt quite add up yet it gets by.So ... shut up and eat your ice creamThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDundas St. W.s Fugo Desserts serves up a smores coneIf you cant make it to a campfire this summer this treats for youNewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 23 2009 406PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Nine Directed by Rob Marshall Written by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard and Penelope Cruz Classification PG Nine  the new film from Chicago director Rob Marshall is unassuming only in its title. Stuffed with Oscar-winning stars and elaborately staged production numbers it comes from a high-pedigree lineage Its based on the Tony-winning Broadway musical which was in turn based on 81/2 Federico Fellinis 1963 classic film about the absurdities of moviemaking. Fellinis film starred Marcello Mastroianni as the directors creatively blocked surrogate contemplating his youth his womanizing and his childhood. Fellinis self-reflective movie has inspired a number of other films most notably Bob Fosses All That Jazz and Woody Allens Stardust Memories. Nine takes the basic plot from Fellini though the screenplay is credited to Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella based on Arthur Kopits book for the stage musical. The story follows Guido Contini a 50ish Italian director who after illustrious beginnings has recently directed only flops. Hes about to shoot a movie but has no script and in a panic finds himself obsessing about the women in his life. Directed by Rob Marshall Nine stars Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard and Penelope Cruz. The movies first big scene in Romes Cinecitta film studios where Fellini worked sees the various women in Continis life emerging onto an unfinished set trilling ""la la la"" as they circle him. As the film progresses each woman gets a single production number - except for Marion Cotillard as Guidos long-suffering wife Luisa who gets two. The other women include his married mistress Carla (Penelope Cruz); his film star and muse Claudia (Nicole Kidman); his costume designer (Judi Dench); and an American fashion journalist Stephanie (Kate Hudson). In flashbacks Guido also recalls a prostitute from his youth Saraghina (Stacy Ferguson or Fergie of Black Eyed Peas); and his judgmental mother (Sophia Loren looking very much like a wax statue of herself). Ultimately theres no escaping that this is very much a case of mediocritys tribute to genius. Marshalls directorial style includes jumping haphazardly between colour and black-and-white with lots of edits pans zooms and crosscutting that turn the dance numbers into jigsaw puzzles. For all the bustiers and stockings crotch thrusts and breast shakes this all feels too anxiously busy to be erotic. All the performers are game but with the exception of Fergie and Kidman no more than competent as singers. The songs are memorable only in the awfulness of their lyrics. Sings Luisa ""My husband makes movies. To make them he makes himself obsessed. He goes for weeks on end without a bit of rest. No other way can he achieve his level best."" Fergie gets the biggest and loudest number called Be Italian . Cruz lounges in her pretty lingerie and waves her derriere while cooing to Guido in A Call from the Vatican . Dench - as Guidos confidant the warmest presence in the film - shakes it to a bit of quaint generic razzmatazz called Folies Bergere. The most grating may be Hudson gyrating in a sparkly mini-dress and singing a new song a sub-Madonna pungent slice of formaggio called Cinema Italiano  with the lyrics ""I feel my body chill gives me a special thrill each time I see that Guido neo-realism."" The movie improves in the scenes when Guido climbs into his blue Alfa Romeo and takes a spin out of Rome down the coast to a spa. Day-Lewis - who can carry a tune but no more - at least looks great lean and feral in his black Italian sports jacket and shades. The acerbic irony of Mastroiannis original performance is missing but at least Day-Lewiss bemused puckish expression suggests a man who finds real life a messy substitute for the relative coherence of the movies. Only in its second half does the film start to show a suggestion of coherence. When his mistress attempts suicide when his muse rejects him when the priests of his youth reveal themselves to be just more movie fans Guido has to face himself or more precisely his wife. Instead Cotillard who won her Oscar as Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose  emerges from the shadows and gives Nine some emotional substance. Even more to her credit she does so in spite of Marshalls crude staging which includes an overedited black-and-white striptease number where shes being grabbed at by various men. With her eyes and voice alone Cotillard communicates the ache and humiliation of the spurned spouse and the movies sole slender idea Behind every genius theres someone suffering for his art.

"Nine review Talent lights up uneven musical |       NJ.com comments Nine review Talent lights up uneven musical Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 17 2009 at 435 PM updated December 18 2009 at 1254 PM View/Post Comments David James/The Weinstein Co.Daniel Day-Lewis and Marion Cotillard in Rob Marshalls ""Nine."" Imagine a person who first spends months alone then rushes to surround himself with people; who asks for suggestions but demands he remain the supreme arbiter; who expects to be both absolutely unique and internationally understood. Give him a therapist and you have a patient. Give him a camera and you have a filmmaker. Nine (PG-13) The Weinstein Company (118 min.) Directed by Rob Marshall. With Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and substance abuse. Few directors were as talented or untamed as Federico Fellini a situation he himself recognized. He even gloriously explored it in ""81/2"" his 1963 classic about a director setting out on a new film who is unable to think of anything but all the women in his flawed and messy life. That movie eventually became the Broadway musical ""Nine"" starring Raul Julia (it was later revived with Antonio Banderas). Now its become a movie starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the singing-and-dancing Italian filmmaker Guido Contini. ""Nine"" directed by Rob Marshall -- who led the film adaptation of ""Chicago"" to Oscar glory in 2002 -- is a hugely theatrical often enjoyable experience. But like Guidos life its also a bit uneven. The idea is that Guidos life is full of females -- his wife his mistress his star even the memory of his dead mother. As he races frantically around Italy trying to come up with an idea for his new movie ""Italia"" they take the foreground in his mind. There are two problems with this and they are present from the start of ""Nine."" The first is that Arthur Kopit and Maury Yeston conceived the original show as a series of solo acts for the women. Their numbers rarely involve Guido and dont weave through the rest of the story. The second is that Yeston is a composer of limited gifts. There isnt a memorable melody; the one number that people do recall ""A Call From the Vatican"" is memorable thanks to the extremely sexy women who have performed it (onstage Anita Morris and Jane Krakowski; on-screen Penelope Cruz.) What ""Nine"" does have going for it though is six solid talents -- Marshall Day-Lewis and co-stars Cruz Marion Cotillard a surprising Fergie and the immortal Sophia Loren. (Neither Nicole Kidman as Guidos muse nor Kate Hudson as a journalist come off especially well in the film.) Day-Lewis is an unusual choice for the lead and in some ways the wrong one -- theres a spoiled indolence to the character he just doesnt get. His Guido is too espresso-driven too intensely intellectual; he seems far more likely to have written four scripts for a project than none at all. Day-Lewis is a decent singer though and while the numbers require more acrobatics than actual routines hes limber fearless and incredibly well-prepared. (But then when hasnt he been?) Even better is Cruz who gets the ""Vatican"" number and spends most of her scenes in the least amount of clothing. She plays her number to the hilt and nails the sex-kitten part. And a pleasant shock is Fergie of hip-hop group the Black Eyed Peas as the earthy animalistic older woman of Guidos childhood dreams. Two other women provide their own memories. Oscar-winner Cotillard as Guidos wife reminds us just how consistently wonderful an actress shes turned out to be (and what a strong Oscar contender she is this year if not for this then for ""Public Enemies""). And then theres Sophia. Lorens role as the spirit of Guidos dead mother is not large although her role in Italian cinema is immense. In some ways she is Italian cinema from its realistic dramas to its comic romps. She wears that history lightly but she brings it to every scene here. Its the whole film thats the problem. Even in Fellinis hands ""81/2"" always risked being a symphony of self-indulgence a mans demand that we take him on his own terms or not at all. Minus star Marcello Mastroianni -- and with its revue-style construction substituting for Fellinis streaming surrealism -- this movie spotlights those flaws. But it does have a director who loves theater and a star who will do anything to get it right. In Cotillard it has an actress of aching vulnerability and in Cruz one of steaming sexuality. And it has an icon in Loren -- who if Guido Contini were really serious about making a film called ""Italia"" would have to be in every frame.

But in the clumsy hands of director Rob Marshall this tacky all-star botch more closely resembles a video catalog for Victorias Secret. Penelope Cruz wriggling around in her underwear -- the heavily edited result cannot quite be called dancing -- in the best number ""A Call From the Vatican"" is about as good as its going to get in this faux-Fosse eyesore. Maury Yestons mediocre imitation-Kander-and-Ebb 1982 Broadway musical has been further edited and updated to suit the vocal limitations of its Weinstein-gerrymandered cast. PHOTOS WHO DRESSED THE BEST AT THE NINE PREMIERE? Or in the case of Kate Hudson as a journalist for American Vogue who vaguely tries to seduce our hero the character and her awful number ""Cinema Italiano"" (in badly lit black-and-white) are interpolations that could be cut without changing the movie one whit. Unfortunately unlike in Marshalls overrated ""Chicago"" none of the numbers in ""Nine"" really advance the story but rather merely announce whats already been stated in dialogue -- such as ""I Cant Make This Movie."" Not that any of the magic survives from Fellinis classic in this patchy adaptation of Arthur Kopits Broadway book credited to Michael Tolkin (""The Player"") and the late Anthony Minghella. Daniel Day-Lewis is fatally miscast as Fellinis alter ego Guido Contini who is having trouble coming up with a story for his about-to-shoot movie in a weakly evoked 1965 Rome which bears approximately the same relation to the real thing that Chef Boyardee does to fettuccine Alfredo. One of our best actors Day-Lewis unfortunately lacks the charm of stage predecessors Raul Julia and Antonio Banderas so it is difficult to care at all about Guidos anguish over his career and his very complicated love life. When he sings ""I have nothing to say"" he could very well be talking about ""Nine."" Guido is married to the long- suffering Luisa (Marion Cotillard) his former leading lady but carrying on a messy affair with the married Carla (Cruz) -- and quite possibly his current leading lady/muse Claudia (the barely seen frozen-faced Nicole Kidman). Our hero also is haunted by ugly black-and-white flashbacks to his youth where his involvement with a whore (Fergie not bad) meets the disapproval of his mother (Sophia Loren who sadly resembles a slightly melted exhibit from Madame Tussauds). Each of these ladies -- except for Luisa who gets two -- has a musical number as does Judi Dench as Guidos costume designer and confidante who gamely offers up the incongruous ""Folies Bergere."" All of the numbers for some inexplicable reason (budget?) take place on the same massive soundstage. It doesnt exactly make for gripping cinema and neither does the choppy editing required to splice together a series of star turns that simply dont flow as a movie. The jaw-droppingly awful ""Nine"" is the worst Broadway-to- Hollywood transfer since ""The Producers"" -- the cinematic equivalent of that movies show ""Springtime for Hitler."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Clooney Streep Bullock among SAG Awards noms Read Next Clooney Streep Bullock among SAG Awards noms Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 71343 How Hillary blew her big moment 38013 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 20134 Judge blasts Nick Denton for lying about Gawker stock value Now On Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him No pot for Snoop Dogg at DNC concert SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

By Dana Stevens After youve seen Nine come back here and check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Nine Late December is musical season time for the release of movies like Chicago Dreamgirls or Rob Marshalls latest Nine (The Weinstein Company) expensive ungainly screen adaptations of Broadway musicals packed with movie stars whose disproportionate off-screen fame makes them stick out like plums in a Christmas pudding. These musicals seem intended to remind us of the kind of movies ""they"" dont make anymore but really the only thing they remind us of is one another. (Last years Mamma Mia doesnt count in this category; it was released in summer not at Christmastime and was a fluffy jukebox musical with no aspirations to Oscar prestige.) This kind of movie is superfluous yet strangely compelling. We dont need to see Daniel Day-Lewis and Nicole Kidman sing a duet next to a Roman fountain any more than we need to see an elephant pirouette in a tutu but wouldnt you be crazy to pass up the opportunity to see either? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That elephant-in-a-tutu analogy works in more ways than one. Theres something about Nine that smacks of the freak show or the zoo Step right up pay 10 and you can see eight superstars six of whom have won Oscars singing songs in sparkly costumes. Two of them Penelope Cruz and Marion Cotillard will at some point get nearly naked. Never mind that the songs range from mediocre to actively unlistenable and that few of these actors know how to put over a song. Nine is abundantly stocked with star power but the energy these charismatic performers generate is never harnessed in the service of the movie. Advertisement As Guido Contini the tormented Italian filmmaker whose fantasy life provides a pretext for the musical numbers Daniel Day-Lewis has none of the suave dissolution of Marcello Mastroianni the hero of Fellinis 8 1/2 which inspired the original stage show. His Guido is neurasthenic and disheveled perpetually on the verge of either a laughing or weeping fit. At a creative impasse in his career Guido is under pressure to begin production on his next film but despite his blustering press conferences about how the results will change cinematic history he doesnt even have a script yet. So Guido retreats to a seaside resort town to pretend to write to fantasize about the women hes known and to carry on with his needy fragile mistress (Penelope Cruz) who like him is already married. That essentially constitutes the entire action of Nine. Once hes reached the resort town Guido does little but run his fingers through his hair and smoke while waiting for another musical number to begin inside his brain. Leave it to Day-Lewis the most cerebral of leading men to sell us on the idea that a character this uninteresting has a rich inner life. Luckily for the stir-crazy audience Guido has company for his sojourn by the sea. Lilli (Judi Dench) an old friend and the costume designer for his films arrives to harass him (affectionately) about his nonexistent script. And his wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard) shows up unexpectedly providing the occasion for some adultery-based melodrama and the films best musical number ""Take It All"" in which the astonishingly talented Cotillard performs a physical and emotional striptease. But when Guidos muse an Anita Ekberg-like Scandinavian actress named Claudia (Nicole Kidman) flies in for a costume fitting everything grinds to a halt again. Kidman and Day-Lewis duet by that fountain may be the movies musical and dramatic low point. Weve been given no idea what these characters past relationship is or what they mean to each other so her revelation that hes ""special to me in my life/ since the first day that I met you"" rings no truer than a junior-high yearbook inscription. (Then theres the fact that Kidman has entered some strange phase in her career in which she appears to have been replaced by her own Madame Tussauds figure. But thats a whole other column.) As in Chicago Marshalls big plan for dynamically transferring the spectacle from stage to screen is to stand in front of a proscenium stage and swoop his camera around. Full-length shots of singing and dancing bodies are rare and quickly interrupted by edits as if Marshall is afraid to let us see his cast in action. One of the more effective numbers ""Be Italian"" works largely because it tries less hard than the others to be cinematic and because the Black Eyed Peas Fergie playing the village prostitute Saraghina abounds in the broad sassy vulgarity the song requires. Ultimately Nines problem is simple. Translations of stage musicals to the screen rarely work unless the songs are really really good and even then its tricky. And these songs with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston are a far cry from Rodgers and Hart--when I say ""Be Italian"" is the catchiest song in the score Im grading on a serious curve. I wasnt a fan of Marshalls Chicago with its frantic camerawork and calculated Oscar-seeking behavior but I can still hum at least three songs from the score. Nine seems unlikely to garner any little gold men but in a way it already has them. Watching it is like watching six Oscar statuettes interact onscreen.Become a fan of Slate on Facebook.

Daniel Day-Lewis plays Guido the Italian genius movie director who is caught up in a maelstrom of his own making - hes set to direct a movie for which he hasnt even written the script and his mistress (played by Penelope Cruz) is vying with his wife (Marion Cotillard). Hounded by paparazzi hangers-on agents managers and assorted other predatory zoological specimens of showbiz Guido becomes his own best protagonist. The script that Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella fashioned from the musical - with a book by Arthur Kopit and music and lyrics by Maury Yeston - is deft and fast-moving but shouldnt a musical have at least a few songs you can hum on your way home? Call me old-fashioned but I can remember when musicals were about the music. No longer. (The biggest Tony Award-winning musical in history was ""The Producers."" Can you name me one song from it besides ""Springtime for Hitler""?) Its still worth seeing ""Nine"" for Day-Lewiss bemused intensity and for the showstopping appearances by Sophia Loren (still looking great) Kate Hudson Dame Judi Dench (yes she sings) and Cruz. But a lot more talent and energy is expended on this show than it warrants. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for sexual content and smoking.)

We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren) the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penelope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.The biggest difference though is that almost 50 years later director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers including the late Anthony Minghella also stress the humour of Guidos philandering often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard who conveys the sadness of being  Guidos wife although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.

The film derides what grated and is facile. I also think in the grated and facile there was a bit that alot of the woman who watched it would maybe privately like to be a bit of. I loved to see Judy Dench playing her role...sexy and sensible. As I left this film with my two girlfriends it generated a surprising amount of discussion.

Such a strong cast and great songs and performances. Like Broken Embraces and Day For Night it is a film about film making and moves between fantasy and reality.

Huge disappointment. I give it a 20% for the gorgeous lightening in some scenes and a very sexy dance by Penelope Cruz (despite the strong mysogenist tone of the movie). But this does not save this movie which has not storyline whatsoever (youve seen in the trailer that it is about a director that has lost his passion well you wont get more than that) and is relying way too much on a famous names but not a good cast for this movie as none of the actors - except Fergie - can remotely sing. Daniel Day-Lewis should stick to his brilliant acting and never ever submit us to his atrocious singing.

An egotistical man comes to terms with his egotistical ways and goes through an egotistical trip to find redemption... disgustingly he does- and were supposed to feel pleased for this revolting man... Kidmans character Claudia says these women arent real- its the only true moment in the film. I was so depressed coming out- the trailer had looked so good and Ive been a fan of the music for a while.

The vein of awe mined by the movie is nothing short of unbelievium. This is a new way of coming to your senses--put those 3-D glasses on your face and you come to a sense of delight that quickly gives way to a sense of astonishment. The planetary high doesnt last. The closer the story comes to a lumbering parable of colonialist aggression in the jungles of an extragalactic Vietnam the more the enchantment fizzles. Much of the time though youre transfixed by the beauty of a spectacle that seems all of a piece. Special effects have been abolished in effect since the whole thing is so special. ENLARGE The Navi versions of Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington in James Camerons Avatar. 20th Century Fox The word ""avatar"" wasnt invented by Mr. Cameron though everything else in the production seems to have been. (With the help that is of a few thousand colleagues around our own planet.) In Hindu myth an avatar is a deity descended to earth in human form. In computer parlance its an icon that represents a person in virtual reality or cyberspace. In the movie its a manufactured body thats remotely controlled--not by some hand-held clicker but through brain waves generated by a human being who functions as the bodys driver. If this sounds technobabbly in the description its dazzling in the execution. The main driver-to-be--or rather animating spirit-to-be--is an ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) whose combat injuries have left him confined to a wheelchair. Hes part of a scientific program run by a tough cookie named Grace Augustine; shes played by Sigourney Weaver. The program has begun to explore Pandora whose atmosphere is toxic to earthlings using avatars with recombinant DNA--part human part alien--constructed along the lines of the planets dominant species; theyre very tall very blue Giacometti-slender and Superman-agile. The movie offers several lyrical passages but one of the best belongs to Jake. Its when he inhabits his avatar for the first time and discovers that his new legs can take his lithe new body through some of the most sublime scenery on not-Earth. No description of that scenery will spoil the experience of the 3-D process (which dispenses with the usual eye-catching tricks) or the seamless integration of live action motion-capture animation computer-generated images and whatever other techniques went into the mix--maybe witchcraft or black magic. (I havent seen the IMAX version; thats for my next viewing.) Some of the flora suggest an anhydrous Great Barrier Reef (airborne jellyfish coral-colored conical plants that spiral down to almost-nothingness when touched) or in the case of Pandoras floating mountains represent an homage to the Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki. As for the fauna theyre not only prodigiously varied--flamboyant dragons six-legged steeds elephantine chargers with heads like battering rams nature-blue in tooth and claw--but creatures with convincing lives of their own unlike the cheerfully bizarre creations that filled the Mos Eisley cantina in ""Star Wars."" Then there are the indigenes the French term for natives being appropriate because Pandora evokes the Indochina that existed before Frances doomed war against an indigenous insurgency as well as the Vietnam that became a battleground for American troops. Theyre called the Navi and to describe them as humanoid may be to defame them inasmuch as they unlike most of the films Americans revere their planet and live in harmony with their surroundings. The most beautiful of the Navis--at least the one with the most obvious star quality--is a female warrior named Neytiri. As most of our planet already knows from the publicity Jake falls for her in a big but complicated way. Big because Neytiri as played by Zoe Saldana is so alluring--cerulean-skinned lemon-eyed wasp-waisted long-tailed anvil-nosed wiggly-eared (trust me its all seductive) and given to feral snarls in the heat of battle. But complicated because Jake is secretly working both sides of the jungle. Hes in love with Neytiri and soon embraces her peoples values. (Yes theres circumstantial evidence that Mr. Cameron knows about ""Dances With Wolves"" along with ""Tarzan"" ""Green Mansions"" ""Frankenstein"" ""Princess Mononoke"" ""South Pacific"" ""Spartacus"" and ""Top Gun."") At the same time Jake is spying for a gimlet-eyed military commander Col. Miles Quaritch. (Stephen Lang proves that broad cartoony acting can also be good acting.) The evil colonel has promised the ex-Marine a procedure that will restore the use of his paralyzed legs in exchange for information that will help chase the Navi from their sacred land which happens to be the only place where unobtainium can be obtained. Its no reflection on Mr. Worthington or Ms. Saldana both of whom are impressive--though how exactly do you judge such high-tech hybrid performances?--that their interspecies love story lacks the heat of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet clinging to each other on the storm-swept decks of ""Titanic."" Teenage girls will not return to see this film half a dozen times or more unless they possess a rogue gene for wigglable ears. But then ""Avatar"" revises the relationship between everyone in the audience and the characters on screen. Actors have always been avatars; theyve always represented our hopes and fears in the virtual reality of motion pictures. In much of this film however theyve been transformed by technology into a new and ambiguous breed of entertainment icon--not the quasihuman denizens of ""The Wizard of Oz"" or the overgrown glove puppets of ""The Polar Express"" but nearly palpable fantasy figures that inhabit a world just beyond our reach. The fantasy quotient of ""Avatar"" takes its first major hit when the Navi take their first hit from the American military. Mr. Cameron has devoted a significant chunk of his movie to a dark didactic and altogether horrific evocation of Vietnam complete with napalm Agent Orange and helicopter gunships (one of which is named Valkyrie in a tip of the helmet to ""Apocalypse Now."") Whatever one may think of the politics of this antiwar section two things can be said with certainty it provokes an adrenalin rush (what that says of our species is another matter) and it feels a lot better when its over. Other narrative problems intrude. For all its political correctness about the goodness of the Navis ""Avatar"" lapses into lurid savage rituals complete with jungle drums that would not have seemed out of place in the first ""King Kong."" While Ms. Weavers performance is a strong one it isnt clear what her character is doing as an avatar or how the Navi perceive her. What couldnt be clearer though is that Mr. Camerons singular vision has upped the ante for filmed entertainment and given us a travelogue unlike any other. I wouldnt want to live on Pandora mainly because of the bad air but Im glad to have paid it a visit. Nine Life is not a cabaret in ""Nine"" Rob Marshalls extravagant screen adaptation of the Broadway musical despite many Bob Fosse tonalities and tropes. Its a carnival in keeping with the source of its inspiration the Federico Fellini film ""81/2."" And as befits that overblown self-indulgent pseudopsychoanalytic and still fascinating source the carnival is loud brash brassy sexy and sometimes tacky or silly but always entertaining. ENLARGE Penelope Cruz belts out a number in Nine. IFC Films Daniel Day-Lewis as the Fellini surrogate Guido Contini does charmingly eccentric variations on the theme of Marcello Mastroianni doing his own version of Guido/Federico the blocked maestro who spends the whole film trying to figure out what his next film will be. (At times this slouching brooding director looks like a chain-smoking Ichabod Crane.) ""Nine"" isnt the equal of Mr. Marshalls ""Chicago"" but its a fine showcase for the women in its cast an extraordinary assemblage of stars who deliver a variety of high-quality goods in musical numbers of variable quality. The first shot of Penelope Cruz who plays Carla Guidos mistress finds her sliding down a fuchsia fabric slide; from there it gets even better as Ms. Cruz gives herself bravely and lustily to a hoochie-koochie dance routine that even has her swinging on a trapeze. Judi Dench as Lilli Guidos costume designer and confidante comes on stage with a Marlene Dietrich demeanor and a mile-long red feather boa. Her number is drop-dead stunning as well as an ad hoc seminar in sheer showmanship. Nicole Kidman as Claudia Guidos muse gets to sing the only first-rate song in the score ""Unusual Way"" and she does it gentle justice. The films most remarkable performance is given by Marion Cotillard as Luisa Guidos long-suffering wife. Her musical number ""My Husband Makes Movies"" has more range than any of the others from coiled calm to unchained ferocity. And Ms. Cotillards gift for mystery--the art of doing much while seeming to do almost nothing--serves her brilliantly in the movies best scene which couples humiliation with insight. I havent mentioned until now the most remarkable presence in ""Nine"" that of Sophia Loren as Guidos late but ever-present mother. Its always a pleasure to see Ms. Loren but seeing her in this context summons up half a lifetime of screen history. She no less than Fellini embodies the glory days of Italian cinema. Police Adjective Ionesco lives. The droll spirit of the late Romanian playwright who wrote such absurdist classics as ""Rhinoceros"" informs ""Police Adjective"" a not-so-absurdist oddity in Romanian with English subtitles. The movie comes on like a put-on--next to nothing happens for an excruciatingly long time--and ends as a fascinating dialectic between following ones conscience or following the law. (It doesnt open until next week but Im writing about it now because the Journal wont publish next Friday.) ENLARGE Dragos Bucur as a plainclothes officer in Police Adjective. The Weinstein Company Corneliu Porumboius second feature--his first was the well-regarded ""1208 East of Bucharest""--stars Dragos Bucur as Cristi a young plainclothes cop who spends long days conducting what he terms in his reports a pursuit. There is no pursuit since theres no fugitive. Cristi is conducting an elaborate avoidance maneuver. Assigned to shadow a high-school student suspected of dealing hash he comes to realize that the kid has simply been smoking an occasional joint then keeps shadowing him and shadowing him some more to avoid arresting him and in a country with Draconian drug laws destroying his life. Cristi is principled but inarticulate and maybe not all that bright. During a surreal conversation with his school-teacher wife about a silly popular song he cant begin to comprehend her pretentious deconstruction. When she corrects his use of a word however hes struck by how firmly she cites the lexical authority of the Romanian Academy. Authority and authoritarianism are the films real subjects and they surface in a chilling confrontation between Cristi and Anghelache a police captain played by the formidable Vlad Ivanov. Cristi cant define the word conscience though thats what guides him. The aggressively articulate Anghelache knows what the word means but he cant grasp its importance. Thats a good definition of a despot.

Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Thursday December 17 2009 500 PM Title Nine A perfect catch on paper ""Nine"" is the sort of movie you want to adore. But about halfway through youll have to admit the truth The magic simply isnt there.How is it possible that a movie with so much going for it doesnt generate more heat? After all its directed by Rob Marshall who dazzled audiences -- and Oscar voters - with ""Chicago."" Its packed with enough stars to outshine the heavens. And its award-winning inspirations are Federico Fellinis classic film ""81/2"" and the Broadway musical ""Nine.""Working hard to fit into his unlikely role Daniel Day-Lewis plays Guido Contini an Italian filmmaker tortured by writers block. But really its a wonder hed expect to get anything done given all the women distracting him.During a hectic week in 1965 Rome Guido bounces between his mistress (Penelope Cruz) his muse (Nicole Kidman) and his mother (Sophia Loren) while his best friend (Judi Dench) and long-suffering wife (Marion Cotillard) look on. Kate Hudson also turns up as a seductive reporter and Fergie is the prostitute he remembers meeting as a child.Unfortunately each interaction feels like the quickest of flings allowing us a brief flirtation with a superstar before we move on to the next affair. Everybody gets one or two big scenes interrupted by an awkwardly-inserted musical number.Some of the actresses are more successful than others -- Cruz is playfully sexy Cotillard soulful and Fergie impressively earthy -- but for the most part neither the songs nor the choreography are especially memorable. And because the music isnt integrated into the drama the staging often feels not just theatrical but false.Marshall and his screenwriters -- Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella -- appear less interested in specific stories than in the idea of an Italian character as related to women men religion and culture. So it seems especially odd that there are almost no Italians (and very little character) to be found.In fairness the numbers are flashy enough to entertain and the cast appealing enough to appreciate. Just dont expect to fall in love. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Federico Fellinis 8 1/2 famously opens with a fantasy sequence in which protagonist and Fellini stand-in Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is stuck in traffic looking desperate for some sort of escape. Hes hit a creative dead end with his latest project and the gridlock has crept into his dreams where--at least for a few blessed seconds--he can take to the air and fly. Maybe Guido should have dreamt himself into a musical a genre in which escape is only just a song-and-dance number away. So why does Nine Rob Marshalls adaptation of a 1982 Broadway musical derived from 8 1/2 feel like such a joyless trudge particularly when compared to Fellinis vibrant original? True Fellini provides a tough point of comparison for anyone but maybe Nine should have stayed on the stage where it could benefit from having a medium all to itself. In Nine director Rob Marshall who fared much better with Chicago does a pretty good job of aping the look and feel of the films inspiration in the non-musical sequences but comes up curiously short in the largely imaginative musical numbers. No scene in which Penelope Cruz writhes around in her underwear can be called unsexy but Cruzs big number remains alarmingly unsensual in spite of all the flesh on display. That Maury Yestons songs simply arent that memorable doesnt help. Cruz plays the mistress of Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) an acclaimed director unable to get beyond the title of his latest project Italia. Instead when not bedding Cruz he retreats into memory and recalls the women who inspired him from his late mother (a largely wasted Sophia Loren) to an almost-feral prostitute (Fergie who tellingly and distressingly has the films best musical sequence). Like Fellini Marshall uses this structure to break with reality but he never comes close to the wild abandon of his inspiration and he offers little to compensate for remaining earthbound. Day-Lewis is fine if overly glum as the lead and Marion Cotillard is even better as his oft-neglected wife. But the characters never find much room to breathe between songs that mostly stop the film when they should push it along and spell out motivations instead of developing characters. The new song ""Cinema Italiano"" performed by Kate Hudson is the worst offender It feels entirely inessential instead of just mostly superfluous and actively poor instead of like the film around it shockingly forgettable.

"Nine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nine ) Nine (United States 2009) December 15 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Nine represents director Rob Marshalls second big-screen musical spectacle. His previous effort Chicago won an Oscar; although Nine is likely to win its share of praise it probably wont come close to achieving the same level of acclaim. Although the production numbers are equally impressive this film is neither as inspired nor as rousing. Part of the problem may be that there are too many high profile actresses vying for the spotlight and each has to be given her moment to shine. Also despite following its stage inspiration and bringing structure to Fellinis 8 1/2 (the ultimate source material) Nine still suffers at times from a lack of narrative drive and it doesnt have the surreal dreamlike quality of 8 1/2 to fall back upon. The story unfolds in 1960s Italy where the biggest Italian film director Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) is about to embark upon his latest (and ninth) project. The production called Italia is shrouded in secrecy primarily because Guido is suffering from writers/directors block. He hasnt written a line of the screenplay. About the only thing he knows is that Italia will star his muse international sensation Claudia (Nicole Kidman). Feeling burned out and pressured by the ""money men"" Guido checks into a spa but his problems follow him. His mistress Carla (Penelope Cruz) turns up as does his long-suffering wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard). He is also being pursued by an American journalist named Stephanie (Kate Hudson). His favorite costume designer Lilli (Judi Dench) tries to keep him on the straight-and-narrow but without much success. He has daydreams and flashbacks of himself as a nine-year old interacting with his mother (Sophia Loren) and watching the erotic dancing of Saraghina (Fergie). As the threads of Italias framework slip through his fingers Guido appears headed for a nervous breakdown and perhaps a separation from his beloved Luisa. Nine contains ten songs three of which were written specifically for the movie. All are solos with Daniel Day-Lewis and Marion Cotillard getting two apiece while the other six actresses each receive one. Although some of the songs advance the plot several feel as if they have been included specifically to give an actress a chance to sing and dance. This is especially true of Kate Hudsons Stephanie whose ""Cinema Italiano"" was not in the Broadway production. Fergies ""Be Italian"" despite being one of the musicals best numbers is also extraneous. Too often the narrative portions of Nine feel like bridges to move from one song to the next. In the best musicals song and dialogue blend seamlessly; thats not always the case here. Regardless of whether they appear to ""belong"" or not the nine numbers are professionally staged. The actors some of whom are not known for their singing voices uniformly impress. Who knew Daniel Day-Lewis and Kate Hudson could sing? The most powerful song ""Take It All"" is delivered by Marion Cotillard with a level of passion and intensity that surpasses any non-singing moment. Cotillard is uniformly good however easily outshining her female co-stars. Her scenes with Day-Lewis are dramatically effective. By the end of the film although the average viewer wont care whether Italia gets made he may be wholly invested in the Guido/Luisa relationship. Thats where the payoff lies. It is however a little disappointing that theres no big number to close out the movie. Most musicals save their best for last; Nine closes on an oddly low-key note. The most awkward character is Stephanie who seems to have been shoehorned into the production to provide another excuse for a song. Her number the aforementioned ""Cinema Italiano"" is enjoyable; it just doesnt seem to belong. And Guidos near-dalliance with her occurs at a critical point during his marital strife when it is unlikely he would be interested in pursuing any woman other than Luisa. Stephanie disappears from the movie after this to reappear only when everyone gathers for a fantasy sequence near the end. A number of the songs are burlesque numbers - one of Cotillards as well as the dances of Fergie Dench Cruz and Hudson. The ""PG-13"" rating limits the amount of flesh that can be shown (there is no nudity beyond a brief hint by Cotillard at the end of ""Take It All"") but Nine is awash in innuendo hip gyrations and crotch grabbing. Still the proceedings seem tame - almost as if the practicality of avoiding an ""R"" restrained Marshall from taking a few of the numbers a little further (in particular ""Take It All"" and ""Be Italian""). Daniel Day-Lewis one of todays most serious method actors channels equal parts Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni. As far as hes concerned this is a serious endeavor that just happens to feature a few songs. Day-Lewis performance brings a level of dramatic heft to Nine that at times makes the tone funereal. This is not a happy motion picture which makes the peppy poppy nature of ""Cinema Italiano"" seem especially out of place as compared to the bitter angry ""Take It All."" Nines handling of two key themes from 8 1/2 - the struggle between commerce and art in motion pictures and the difficulty of breaking a creative block- are watered down to the point where theyre minor elements. Theyre present but the film doesnt do anything interesting or unique with them. Nine which was awarded numerous Tony awards during both its original 1982 run and a 2003 revival works better on stage where the audience is there experiencing things live. Marshall experiences difficulty melding the inherent spectacle of the musical numbers with the intimacy of the drama and the mix of fantasy and reality that are carry-overs from 8 1/2. Nine is entertaining (particularly when someone is singing) but this isnt on the crowd-pleasing level of a Chicago or a Dreamgirls. However theres little shame in being ""merely"" engaging in an era when big-budget musicals are members of an endangered species.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Rob Marshalls flawed but frequently dazzling Nine is a hot-blooded musical fantasia full of song dance raging emotion and simmering sexuality. We get to watch British acting dynamo Daniel Day-Lewis be Italian as Guido Contini a genius director of the swinging Sixties (ciao Federico Fellini) struggling to put the movie in his head up on the screen. That movie concerns the women in his life -- mother (Sophia Loren) wife (Marion Cotillard) muse (Nicole Kidman) mistress (Penelope Cruz) reporter (Kate Hudson) colleague (Judi Dench) and whore (Fergie). With an indisputably gifted actor playing ringmaster to such feminine life force whats not to like? You could argue that Nine a 1982 Broadway hit spun off from Fellinis own 1963 psychodrama 8 1/2 and revived in 2003 was never the equal of its source. But Maury Yeston composed a score of surpassing beauty. The challenge for Marshall following his Oscar-winning Chicago was to bring another hallucinatory musical to the screen without repeating himself or dimming the materials blazing untamed theatricality. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> By my score card Marshall hits more than he misses. Those who hated his music-video editing in Chicago will hate it here. He errs by cutting three great songs (""Getting Tall"" ""Be On Your Own"" ""The Bells of St. Sebastian"") for three inferior ones. ""Cinema Italiano"" sung by Hudson is a tacky overproduced misfire. He also shortchanges the influence of Catholicism on this man-child and keeps Guidos nine-year-old alter ego too much in the shadows. Otherwise his work is visionary and electric. And the script by Michael Tolkin and the late much missed Anthony Minghella is uncommonly witty. Guido begins the film at a press conference telling reporters that to talk about a movie is to spoil its mystery. So I wont intrude except to say that Day-Lewis (who replaced an exhausted Javier Bardem) handles his two songs in high style and acts the role like the maestro he is even if he looks as Italian as Big Ben. The women are smashing. Kidman tosses off her big number (""Unusual Way"") but Fergie sells hers (""Be Italian""). Dench is a sassy delight. Cruz does wonders as the mistress sizzling in a rope dance (""Whos afraid to kiss your toes Im not"") and going on to break your heart when Guido breaks hers. Best of all is Cotillard as the wife baring her soul in ""My Husband Makes Movies"" and her body in a new number (""Take It All"") that lets her throw the bum out. Cotillard beautiful and bruising all at once is perfection. As Marshall gathers his cast together for a finale with cinematographer Dion Beebe costume whiz Colleen Atwood and production designer John Myhre working at their highest capacity Nine fires on all cylinders.

An assault on the senses from every conceivable direction--smash zooms the ear-splitting eruption of something like music the spectacle of a creature called Kate Hudson--Nine thrashes about in search of ""cinema"" the way a child thrown into the deep end of a pool flails for a flotation device. Earlier this decade watching choreographer turned director Rob Marshall make an incoherent Oscar-annointed shambles out of Bob Fosses Chicago I wondered if Marshall had ever seen a screen musical before he got the assignment. Watching Nine I began to wonder if Marshall has ever seen a movie other than his own.A desperate bid by Marshall and embattled producer Harvey Weinstein to recapture the ""magic"" of their previous awards-season thoroughbred Nine was adapted by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella from a Tony-winning Broadway musical that itself transformed Fellinis acerbic self-portrait of a creatively blocked serial womanizing director into a treacly fable about getting in touch with ones inner child. Originally produced in 1982 with Raul Julia as the Fellini surrogate Guido Contini and revived two decades later with Antonio Banderas in the part the show itself was never anyones idea of a classic. But director David Leveauxs revival was able to improve upon the stage original--by shortening or excising a couple of the more egregious songs and favoring a more intimate abstract use of space.For the film adaptation in which Daniel Day-Lewis dons Guidos signature black hat the writers have further slashed and burned all but eviscerating the plays turgid second half (in which Contini mounted a musical film about the life of Casanova) and relegating the myriad women in Guidos life--wife (Marion Cotillard) mistress (Penelope Cruz) mother (Sophia Loren) muse (Nicole Kidman) confidante (Judi Dench)--to one forgettable song apiece. Chalk that up as a small victory against Marshalls otherwise unstoppable kitsch offensive.Extravagantly filmed on soundstages in London and locations in Rome--costumes studded with actual Swarovski crystals--Nine may be shiny but all the Oscar winners in the world cant disguise the absentee landlord at the helm. Perhaps hoping to channel something of Fellinis own improvisational energy Marshall proceeds without a map shooting in an arbitrary mixture of color and black-and-white while his cast slips in and out of a smattering of different accents. Then come the fantasy musical numbers most of which take place on a soundstage where the sets for Continis new film are under construction and which Marshall uniformly shoots with one camera dollying back and forth on a semicircular track and another zooming in and out on the glittering spangled couture. Those scenes are then haphazardly intercut with the movies ""real"" action (to ease the audiences presumed anxiety at seeing characters spontaneously burst into song and dance) resulting in the sort of unwieldy melange that is sometimes said to have been ""saved in the editing room"" but not in this case. At the center of the three rings the eminently resourceful Day-Lewis hasnt appeared this rudderless in a role since the justly forgotten Argentine dental comedy Eversmile New Jersey two decades ago.There have been and will continue to be great movies made about the struggle of megalomaniacal directors to reconcile their life and work--Fosse made one with his own musical Fellini homage All That Jazz and Charlie Kaufman another just last year with Synecdoche New York. Failing those high-water marks Nine might at least have been a guiltily pleasurable burlesque were Marshall not so intent on turning all his grande dames into vamped-up grotesques. While Fergie emerges relatively unscathed in part because her role--the feral prostitute Saraghina from whom the chaste young Guido learns the facts of life--is meant to be a vamped-up grotesque poor Hudson (as an enterprising Vogue reporter dumbed down from the plays Cahiers du cinema film critic) may never recover from gyrating her way through the atrocious ""Cinema Italiano"" a number that Marshall stages as something like Night of the Living Versace Runway Show. Wisely keeping her distance Cotillard mostly lurks along the sidelines projecting a wounded visage before finally stepping into the spotlight for the movies single moment of emotional sincerity. Its the only point at which Nine seems more than a total zero.

By Anthony Lane Penelope Cruz Nicole Kidman Daniel Day-Lewis and Kate Hudson in ""Nine.""   Credit Illustration by Andy Friedman The beginning of ""Nine"" feels like an end. The first words we hear are ""You kill your film"" uttered at a press conference by an Italian movie director named Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis). We then find him at the Cinecitta film studios in Rome on an echoing soundstage which starts to fill as if by magic with all the women he has known adored and worked with. They range from his mother (Sophia Loren) to his tigerish mistress (Penelope Cruz) his main muse (Nicole Kidman) and his long-suffering wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard). Also present are his costume designer and confidante (Judi Dench) a reporter from American Vogue (Kate Hudson) and from the shifting sands of his childhood a witchy hooker by the name of Saraghina (Fergie). Together they weave around Guido chanting ""La-la-la"" like a chorus without a song sheet. You wonder where the lyrics went but as the rest of ""Nine"" makes clear youre not missing much. Rob Marshalls film is based on the stage production of the same name and I cant say that I am racked with regret at having skipped it. There are big numbers aplenty--all the actresses get one apiece apart from Cotillard who gets two--and most of them are belted out with growls and gusto (Fergie being the belter-in-chief) but I woke up the next morning as I did after Marshalls previous choice of musical ""Chicago"" without a single tune or phrase still tolling in my head. ""My husband spins fantasies he lives them then gives them to you"" Luisa sings and her words might as well be spoken. You long for the ghost of Lorenz Hart to be unleashed on the whole affair with a hard blue pencil and a head full of rhymes. To be fair the theatrical project was a challenge in the first place having taken its cue from ""81/2"" Fellinis masterpiece of 1963. This means that ""Nine"" is a film of a musical of a film--which was itself the film of a life if you happen to believe that Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) was the harassed alter ego of Fellini himself. The story was that there was no story; Guido could not get his latest film started or even written and that remains the case in ""Nine."" One is forced to ask who wants to make or watch a major Hollywood musical about mental block? ""Singin in the Rain"" was also about obstacles in moviemaking but it found irrepressible joy in seeing them surmounted; each song pushed events along whereas the songs in ""Nine"" merely hold them up. A woman is introduced the action is paused and she gives us the melodious lowdown on her circumstances. Cruz for instance begins with the purring line ""Whos not wearing any clothes? Im not"" though she is in fact wearing about an acre of lingerie and sliding down a long pink slope a lubricious tribute to ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" although Cruz is hellbent on highlighting her rear whereas Marilyn Monroe was too busy stuffing her tongue in her cheek. The wisest figure by far is Judi Dench and its a pity that she is saddled with the most pointless song--a riff on the Folies-Bergere. Wrong country surely but then the movies grip on Italy feels tenuous at best. There are luscious locations and everyone will covet Guidos lithe little Alfa Romeo in powder blue but there is no getting around the ungainly fact that here is a bunch of non-Italian performers speaking like-a theess. (The script is by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella whose 1999 film ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" about foreigners dying to be sucked into Italys warmth and only half succeeding was a far more honest approach to cultural fusion. Just think what Minghella might have wrought at the helm of ""Nine."") Apart from the odd pronto and bene the ban on Italian is absolute without one subtitle. Could this be because the filmmakers are scared that ""Nine"" will be mistaken for an art-house picture? If so their fear is well grounded because ""81/2"" remains the most gorgeous item of festive modernism with its portrait of the artist ensnared by the goddesses of memory and desire. The entire theme of Marshalls film is set by and surpassed by Fellinis opening scene--wordless and breathy with a trapped Mastroianni pounding on the windows of his hearse-black gridlocked car. To follow in the footsteps of Mastroianni is no enviable task and Daniel Day-Lewis adroit as ever approaches it by changing the steps. Where his predecessor lounged and strolled or dipped into a clownish stagger we find Day-Lewis leaner in physique forever on the fast and wolfish prowl--hands in pockets shoulders forward not pushing his sunglasses cutely up and down his nose as Mastroianni did but keeping them on full beam like the Devils headlights. He belongs however in a more focussed movie; this one feels too sluggish for his predations although we do get a loyal reproduction of the scene from ""81/2"" in which Guido watches footage of his latest screen tests with Luisa sitting nearby. She was once his leading lady and Marshall has supplied (as Fellini did not) a flashback to her own test years before with Guido unpinning her hair in front of the camera. Now he does exactly the same to a grateful ingenue and there is no forgetting the look in Cotillards eyes and their tears of simmering wrath. ""To create is to forgive yourself in public"" she says and the line is like a switchblade. She has seen as Fellini saw all too clearly and as ""Nine"" shows only in flickers that the Guidos of this world are drawn toward a helpless and horrifying deal love for arts sake. The beast is not made human by his beauties whether they number eight nine or hundreds; he just becomes more of a beast. The new Terry Gilliam film ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"" has one of those roll-up roll-up titles that appeal to Gilliam who is not so much a movie director as a carnival barker with a bent for motion pictures. The last example was ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and some of its tropes return here the team of travelling players and the elderly fabulist who tries to dictate the proceedings. In this case our aging hero Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is perched inside a mobile theatre of antiquated design which is trundled through modern London; part of the movies charm is its brazen anachronism--a sense that the past can seep through time and burst into the here and now. (And the now is pretty wretched rusting wastelands beside the Thames.) Also in attendance are Tom Waits as a smiling Beelzebub in a bowler hat; a dwarf sadly compulsory in any work that flirts with the surreal; and as Parnassuss daughter the British model Lily Cole whose unearthly heart of a face is like a special effect. Above all we get four types of Tony the gadabout who consorts with Parnassuss troupe. He is played by Johnny Depp Colin Farrell Jude Law and Heath Ledger the first three deputizing for the last who died before the films completion. It should not be mistaken for his finest hour; we see his larking but not the undertow of frailty that tugged at ""Brokeback Mountain"" and his principal duty here like everyone elses is to go with the flow of phantasmagoria. Thus people are invited onto the Doctors stage and sent through a rickety mirror into a world where anything goes--a candy-colored landscape out of ""Mary Poppins"" an oily river that curls up into a snakes head you name it. Are these embodiments of each persons fancy or did Parnassus himself cook them up? I have no idea any more than I can decide whether C.G.I. was the best or the worst thing that could have happened to Terry Gilliam. His gifts of invention were already so fecund and so prolix that this newfound ability to construct anything that drifts into his minds eye--as opposed to the ramshackle hand-drawn delight of his earlier animation--spells both enchantment and chaos. He can follow any train of thought so he does and its no surprise when the trains run out of steam. No such mania infects ""The Young Victoria"" Jean-Marc Vallees account of the monarchs early years which veers in the other direction. From the start it feels handsome steady and stuck; the ties that bind the historical bio-pic are no looser than those which constrain a royal personage and the frustration to which Victoria would later admit (""I had led a very unhappy life as a child--had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection"") is legible in the face of Emily Blunt who takes the title role. She is attended by a host of British actors--Paul Bettany though too young makes a winning and cynical Lord Melbourne and Jim Broadbent resembling a Gillray cartoon detonates the stolid tale with a loud and well-attested explosion of rage at a banquet--but the movie like the age that it depicts stands or falls on the woman at its core. Blunt strikes me as the real deal languid but biting like Jeanne Moreau yet able to command a scene while somehow appearing to shift to one side (as Moreau would never do) and observe with a skeptics smile. The little puff of relief that Victoria gives after addressing the Privy Council on the morning of her accession is despite her duties the exhalation of a free spirit and one prays that films more liberating than this and more likely to feed Blunts appetites will come her way. The Colin Firth of ""A Single Man"" likewise rises above the atmosphere that encircles him. He plays George who teaches literature at a college in Los Angeles in 1962 while mourning the loss of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) in a car accident. When George walks through the snow toward the crash site not only are his pants perfectly creased but even the corpse preserves a certain je ne sais quoi. True this is a dream sequence but then the whole movie with its glazed and polished air could be a dream. We know for instance how English professors dress some trim-suited and clerical others avuncular in tweed many too deep in Dryden to be bothered with their outward crust and one or two no better than compost heaps. Not this lot. They look as spry and as spotless as an advertising spread in LUomo Vogue. Whos in charge here for heavens sake--a fashion designer? Well yes for ""A Single Man"" is the first feature to be directed by Tom Ford. The hero of the story adapted from the novel by Christopher Isherwood explains himself in voice-overs ""Just get through the goddamned day bit melodramatic perhaps but then again my heart has been broken. Feel as if Im drowning sinking cant breathe"" he says. Such wordiness seems unjust to Firth who is perfectly capable of showing any congestion of spirit by body language alone. The film is slowed by its own beauty but it is salvaged by two majestic scenes. In one George learns of Jims death in a phone call from a relative during which his voice (this being 1962) must betray nothing leaving his face (on which Ford is smart enough to keep the camera) to do all the work; in another George goes around for a long evening with his friend Charley (Julianne Moore) who likes to start boozing as she puts on her face in the morning. Two characters trying and failing to drown their hopes and regrets and two strong actors refusing to be tight-laced by a directors exercise in style here is a mood piece looking for a fight.

In Rob Marshalls spangly movie version of the lavishly bombastic 1982 Broadway show -- itself adapted from Federico Fellinis 1963 art-film landmark 8 1/2 -- Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a famous Italian film director who in 1965 is preparing to shoot his ninth motion picture. But hes in the grand throes of an existential midlife crisis and though hes trying to devise a way to put that bewilderment on screen hes incapable of moving forward. He dithers and pouts but he never does anything. Theres a naggingly abstract quality to his cosmic angst. Guidos life spins around seven bedazzling women who are all obsessed with him his demure wife (Marion Cotillard) his saucy-neurotic mistress (Penelope Cruz) his doting mother (Sophia Loren) his loyal costume designer (Judi Dench) his sex-bomb leading lady (Nicole Kidman) a Vogue reporter (Kate Hudson) and a mysterious spirit from his boyhood (Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas). Each of them gets to do one big number (the wife gets two) and when the songs are going on Nine at least has a pulse. Yet this musical to my ears hasnt aged well. The melodies tend to cluster into cliche hooks (theres a lot of honking burlesque and too many faux-60s-Italian carnival-of-life showstoppers) and Marshalls staging lacks the thrilling unity he brought to Chicago. The numbers while lively remain cluttered and stage-bound. The women however are spirited and sexy. Cruz performs a mock bump-and-grind with real heat and Fergie as an oh-so-Fellini-esque beach drifter turns herself into a wild electric siren. If only the lyrics werent so awful Cotillard a lovely presence is martyred by having to sing such gems as ""My husband makes movies/To make them he lives a kind of dream/In which his actions arent always what they seem"" No wonder Day-Lewis looks like hes having stomach trouble. He spends most of Nine as a haunted spectator and you want to tell the guy to lighten up. The ? movie Guido is trying to dream doesnt look like much fun and neither is Nine.

""Nine"" is a savvy piece of musical filmmaking. Sophisticated sexy and stylishly decked out Rob Marshalls disciplined tightly focused film impresses and amuses as it extravagantly renders the creative crisis of a middle-aged Italian director circa 1965. Given its basis in a 27-year-old Broadway show which itself had its unlikely origins in Federico Fellinis self-reflective 1963 classic ""81/2"" the Stateside Weinstein release will probably find a more receptive audience among culture vultures than with the masses. But a robust marketing push stressing the stellar cast strong notices and the ""another Chicago "" vibe should still generate solid returns especially in urban areas. Although the original 1982 production with a book by Arthur L. Kopit music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and Raul Julia in the leading role won five Tony Awards and ran for 729 performances many theater mavens preferred the 2003 revival and its star Antonio Banderas. But given its heritage and the profession of the central character the musical has found its proper place on the bigscreen along with a cast that could scarcely be bettered. Not only can they act but Daniel Day-Lewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz Judi Dench Nicole Kidman Kate Hudson and Sophia Loren can sing. Why didnt anyone know? As one the cast would undoubtedly respond ""Because no one ever asked."" First big scene at Romes Cinecitta Film Studios allows the film to establish its stylized method at the outset as the many women in the life of dashing cinema genius Guido Contini (Day-Lewis) musically make their way onto an unfinished set on giant stage five as he faces the imminent start of a movie he hasnt begun to write. Called ""maestro"" far too often for his own good Guido is the sun around which swirl innumerable lovers loyal workers acolytes and hangers-on all whom vie for his time and attention while peppering him with questions about the new picture. Instead of making Guido entirely self-absorbed and self-serious Day-Lewis at once places the viewer firmly in the palm of his hand and then in his pocket by emphasizing the characters humorous awareness of his position in life. He puts on a grand show at a press conference although one journalist noting that Guidos last two films flopped pierces the armor of jokiness by asking ""Have you run out of things to say?"" At this the director retreats to a seaside resort to recharge and tells his loyal wife Luisa (Cotillard) to stay home only to receive his lusty mistress Carla (Cruz) who proceeds to steam up the place with her number ""A Call From the Vatican."" Except for Luisa who has two the women define their roles in Guidos life by through single songs which are uniformly arresting in their own right even if they finally reveal themselves to be mostly straightforward ""statement"" songs with a similar nature in the Weill-via-Kander-and-Ebb mold. After Carlas declaration of the hots for Guido come ""Folies Bergere"" a celebration of dreams and sensual bewitchment from Lilli (Dench) Guidos old costume designer and confidante; ""Be Italian"" rousingly belted out by Fergie playing a beachside prostitute of Guidos boyhood; ""My Husband Makes Movies"" Luisas moving lament that her husbands profession takes precedence over her; ""Cinema Italiano"" a celebration of the Italy depicted in Guidos movies sung by flirty journalist Stephanie (Hudson); the reassuring mother-to-son lullaby ""Guarda la luna"" sung by Loren; ""Unusual Way"" an acute admission by Guidos muse and frequent lead actress Claudia (Kidman) of the strange hold he has on her; and the new ""Take It All"" in which Luisa brutally reminds her husband of the sexy woman he is losing. Some other songs from the show have been adapted or dropped and bracketing the womens numbers are two from Guido the egocentric ""Guidos Song"" and his throwing in of the towel ""I Cant Make This Movie""; ""Find another genius"" he petulantly challenges those who would listen. Cutting between black-and-white and color in the musical numbers and like Fellinis film constantly on the move as Guido is buffeted about with scarcely a moment to breathe much less write a script ""Nine"" takes the the matter of directile dysfunction seriously without being pretentious about it. With the distance of 45 years the glory days of Italian filmmaking are depicted more for their chaotic fun than for their grave chic or philosophical import and the double delight for the cast to be working in both a musical and a picture set in such a fabled era (one known personally among the cast members only by Loren) plainly shows in their spirited performances. The script sets the course in these matters as well as others notably in finding a way to honor ""81/2"" while enabling one to put it to the side of ones mind and in illuminating Guidos folly while still taking seriously his relationships with women. It was not for nothing that the writers engaged were Michael Tolkin author of ""The Player"" and Anthony Minghella whose ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" so evocatively captured the Rome of just a few years before. Working again with his resourceful lenser Dion Beebe Marshall shoots in a nimble style that keeps the film alive all the way; editing by Claire Simpson and Wyatt Smith is fast but not frantic.
