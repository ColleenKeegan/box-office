But its not such an odd marriage as it sounds when you consider that Sheridans last reach-for-the-tissues effort was In America a semi-autobiographical weepie about hard knocks bereavement and self-improvement in early 80s New York.Here 50 Cent plays Marcus - aka Young Caesar - a fictional version of himself in the rocky years leading up to his first gig. Its this event which marks the end of the movie and 50 Cent must hope the beginning of the rush to buy the new album and video-game of the same name. Die tryin? Laughin all the way to the bank more like.This is a predictable affair in which a boy from the wrong side of the elevated tracks (his mother is a murdered prostitute his father unknown his foster family unwelcoming) embraces street life from an early age (Im a gangsta grandpa and Im proud of it) by selling crack and making his way snappily up the local criminal hierachy. Sheridan and screenwriter Terence Winter (The Sopranos) present a local drugs war as a hackneyed mafia-type affair. Its no surprise when redemption arrives for Marcus via music and a good woman. Throughout characters awkwardily speechify left right and centre - there are so many signposts in the script that the Highways Agency could learn a thing or two from it. And as biographies go it has all the credibility of the ghost-written memoirs of a footballers wife.

With Jennifer Aniston Clive Owen. (100 min.)""Derailed"" is a penny dreadful with A-list stars. Clive Owen who really should have tried harder to be cast as the next James Bond plays a Chicago ad executive who meets a magnetically friendly commuter played by Jennifer Aniston on the morning train to work. Though both are married with children they soon find themselves booking a seedy hotel room. Enter Vincent Cassel who one might think had his fill of this kind of thing after starring in ""Irreversible."" What happens next shall remain a secret but heres a hint Retribution awaits. Heres another Stay home. Grade C- Peter RainerGet Rich or Die Tryin (R)Director Jim Sheridan. With 50 Cent Joy Bryant Terrence Howard. (134 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Lightning didnt strike twice. Eminem made an improbably strong movie debut in ""8 Mile"" but now theres ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" which stars his rapper protege Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson. I had high hopes - its director is Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In America""); and Terence Howard whos on a roll has a meaty part in it. But this thinly autobiographical gangsta odyssey never achieves liftoff and Jackson is unconvincing. Even if you are playing (essentially) yourself it helps if youre an actor first. Grade C-- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Sex/Nudity 11 scenes including nudity and sex Violence 19 scenes including torture. Profanity 295 harsh expressions. Drugs 5 scenes with drinking 7 scenes with smoking and 11 scenes with drug use or selling.Zathura A Space Adventure (PG)Director Jon Favreau. With Tim Robbins Frank Oz Jonah Bobo. (113 min.)Two squabbling brothers home alone for a few minutes find an old board game in the basement with mysterious not to mention dangerous properties. Once the duo sets the game in motion they not only find their home adrift in outer space but also have to learn teamwork to cope with a demented robot and attacks by Zorgons (meat-eating pyromaniac lizard-men). Here appropriately retro effects and family values outweigh an episodic script. After the screening a preteen next to this critic asked his mom ""Why did you think I wouldnt like this?"" Theres your endorsement. Grade B-- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity 1 instance of mild innuendo. Violence 15 scenes. Profanity 5 mild expressions. Drugs None.Still in ReleaseThe Legend of Zorro (PG)Director Martin Campbell. With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" starring Antonio Banderas as the masked one made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the great spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents were meant to sound deliberately fake. (Zorro kept referring to ""the people"" as ""the pipple."" ) Here even Banderas sounds like hes having a hard time sounding authentic. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Zorros swashbuckling wife Elena looks fetching but doesnt have much to do otherwise. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat played by Rufus Sewell sports heavy eyeliner and has plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-- Peter RainerParadise Now (PG-13)Director Hany Abu-Assad. With Kais Nashef Ali Suliman. (90 min.)Said (Nashef) and his friend Khaled (Suliman) are recruited as human bombs by an underground Palestinian terrorist organization in the West Bank in the intermittently powerful ""Paradise Now"" which was directed and co-written by Hany Abu-Assad. He attempts with mixed results to get inside the psyches of men who would blow themselves up for the cause. The film is better than the recent ""The War Within"" which tried for the same things but ultimately and perhaps unavoidably we are left face to face with the unknowable. Grade B+- P.R.Domino (R)Director Tony Scott. With Keira Knightley Mickey Rourke Lucy Liu. (127 min.)The real-life Domino a Bounty Hunter who died in June of an apparent overdose was the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey and supermodel socialite Pauline Stone. Clearly what lured director Tony Scott who knew Domino is the massive contradiction of her life Born into the glamour of London and Beverly Hills she ended up a female Rambo. Whatever reality the actual Domino may have possessed has been sliced and diced by Scotts usual barrage of whiplash camera work and rat-a-tat editing complete with flashbacks flash forwards and flash in-betweens. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 8 scenes including nudity and implied sex Violence 20 brutal scenes. Profanity 186 harsh expressions. Drugs 30 scenes with drinking and 28 scenes with smoking.Dreamer Inspired by a True Story (PG)Director John Gatins. With Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning. (102 min.)When racehorse Sonador breaks a leg trainer Ben Crane (Russell) sees a potential brood mare if he can at least get her well enough to walk. Weve seen it all before but this one is so well made its a sure crowd pleaser. Grade B- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity None. Violence 2 mild scenes. Profanity 4 mild expressions. Drugs None.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (R)Director Shane Black. With Val Kilmer Robert Downey Jr. (102 min.)As a petty thief turned aspiring actor and detective in Shane Blacks raucously entertaining ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Robert Downey Jr. is on screen almost all the time which is good news since few performers can hold the screen as well. His live-wire physicality is capable of just about anything. In his new film he uses it for comic effect; at times he is as jumpy and jerky as a cartoon character (Bugs Bunny to be exact). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" makes his directorial debut and he puts a fresh spin not only on that film but also on a whole slew of films noirs. Grade B+- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 13 scenes including nudity. Violence 20 gory scenes. Profanity 130 harsh expressions. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking. 8 scenes with smoking.North Country (R)Director Niki Caro. With Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson. (126 min.)Theron plays a battered wife who fights sexual harassment at her job in the iron mines. She has her best role since ""Monster"" but overall ""North Country"" is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. Grade B-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 16 scenes of innuendo and sexual harassment. Violence 8 scenes including one of rape. Profanity 76 harsh expressions. Drugs 11 scenes with smoking. 10 scenes with drinking.The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. (pg-13)Director Jane Anderson. With Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern. (99 min.)Evelyn Ryan rewrote the definition of resilience in the 50s and 60s supporting ten children and an alcoholic husband by composing jingles and 25-word essays to win hundreds of contests. Moore makes a perfect Evelyn always upbeat and Harrelson as her ineffectual husband is borderline tragic. The film veers from tongue-in-cheek documentary to gritty drama to sitcom but its true to the spirit of daughter Terrys book and of Evelyns life - lumpy but filled with expectancy of good and utterly charming. Grade B - M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 scenes. Profanity 25 expressions. Drugs 8 scenes with drinking.Shopgirl (R)Director Anand Tucker. With Steve Martin Claire Danes. (104 min.)Martin plays a dotcom millionaire who successfully woos Mirabelle (Danes) a salesgirl at Saks. Whether intentionally or not Martin has given us something truly spooky A full-fledged portrait of a hollow man. Grade B- P.R.Sex/Nudity 13 frank scenes of innuendo and sex. Violence None. Profanity 9 fairly mild expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 11 scenes with drinking.Ushpizin (PG)Director Giddi Dar. With Shuli Rand Michal Bat-Sheva Rand Shaul Mizrahi. (90 min.)On the eve of the Succoth holiday in Israel Moshe and his wifes prayers are answered when the destitute couple finds the money they need to buy the required palm myrtle willow and citron for the festival - with enough left over for groceries and rent. They also get a ""blessing"" they didnt pray for ushpizin (holiday guests) in the form of two convicts from Moshes criminal past. Compassion reverence and subtle humor help this collaboration between ultra-Orthodox Israeli actors and secular filmmakers to rise above its modest budget. Grade B- M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 mild scenes. Profanity 3 mild expressions. Drugs 5 scenes with alcohol and 10 scenes with smoking.

And tell you his life story. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Get Rich or Die Tryin Drama. Starring Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson Joy Bryant and Terrence Howard. Directed by Jim Sheridan. (R. 134 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) 50 Cent is a top selling hip-hop artist and ""Get Rich or Die Tryin "" provides an opportunity for his fans to hear a handful of his new songs and become better acquainted with his personality and to an extent his life. The film is not a straight biography; but like ""8 Mile"" in the case of Eminem it fashions fiction out of the grim details of the rappers pre-stardom existence He was orphaned became a drug dealer and five years ago miraculously survived after getting shot nine times including once in the face. This would seem dramatic enough and yet director Jim Sheridan and screenwriter Terence Winter have difficulty fashioning these events into a story that has a coherent point or purpose. Despite some pretense that the story is a moral journey 50 -- or rather his alter ego Marcus -- stays unchanged throughout neither particularly wicked at the start nor sympathetic at the finish. Hes not a go-getter with a fascinating drive to succeed. If anything hes passive. That he survives nine shots is not attributable to any special will to live but to random luck. We see him born into poverty and chaos. His mother whos beautiful and adores him is a drug dealer and when rivals move into her territory they tie her up and set her on fire. And so at 12 Marcus goes to live with his grandparents. Next thing he knows hes selling cocaine on street corners and posing in front of the mirror with his gun. These early scenes are in some ways the best in that the contrast between the aspiration of young Marcus and the squalor of his environment is most pronounced. Marcus dreams of becoming a rapper and its a nice touch that his first songs sound like something a young 50 Cent might have written. It also helps that Marc John Jefferies who plays the young Marcus has a voice that evokes 50. But once Marcus grows up and 50 Cent assumes the role the film becomes muddled. The filmmakers try to capitalize on the excitement and violence of crime without having its stigma tarnish our perceptions of Marcus/50. So were told that as leader of a crack-dealing crew Marcus was a master of efficiency. Thats not very inspiring. In a voiceover 50 tells us that the first and 15th of every month were his busiest days because thats when the welfare checks came in. ""Get Rich"" touches on the realities of drug-dealing but not so much that we begin to see Marcus as a parasite. Every so often theres a hint that the reality was probably a lot crazier than this as when Marcus tells his girlfriend (Joy Bryant) that he has a bullet fragment in his tongue and it inspires her to kiss him immediately. But the movie adopts no distance or irony and has no point of view about life in the hood except Marcus own. That perspective is limited. At one point Marcus drives home in a new Mercedes he bought from dealing crack as 50 comments in voiceover ""I had it all but something was missing."" He had it all? What did he have? He had no career no purpose no family no education no morality. He had a car. In his gangster scenes 50 Cent conveys no gangster pride and we come away with no clue as to his self-conception. That might be the fault of the screenplay but the problem might be 50 as an actor. He can hold the screen. He has a certain magnetism but his range is limited to smiling or smoldering. Surprisingly he does a lot of smiling -- even when hes on his way to shoot somebody. Whod have thought 50 Cent would turn out to be a smiley kind of guy? Ultimately the biggest failure of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin "" is that it doesnt do what ""8 Mile"" did -- it doesnt make the case for its protagonist as a gifted person and we dont come away understanding it as an artists story. Even fans of 50 Cent (and Im one of them) wholl go in knowing how good his music is wont come out knowing how that talent was integrated into his life and what it meant to him except as a commodity. Thats a huge missing piece -- the soul of the movie -- and without it all thats left is the curious tale of a young man who could have died but instead got rich. -- Advisory This film contains simulated sex full frontal male nudity topless female nudity strong language and graphic violence.

"Small Change washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Small Change (Michael Gibson - Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 9 2005 The rap star 50 Cent has led a storied life a rags-to-riches yarn that has become the stuff of pop legend Born Curtis Jackson and reared in Queens New York Jackson never knew his father and lost his mother a drug dealer when he was only 8. Later he became a dealer himself going in and out of jail for dealing crack until deciding in the mid-90s to pursue a career as a rapper. Columbia Records had signed him and his first record was about to hit the streets in 2000 when Jackson (Mr. Cent?) was gunned down; shot nine times he survived and went on to make headlines not only for his infectious beats and lyrics but for his frequent brushes with the law. Good stuff and ripe for the cinematic telling but ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" 50 Cents fictionalized life story in which the rapper plays himself is shockingly inert. While rap fans have no doubt eagerly awaited the big screen debut of their hero -- whose hulking tattooed physique belies the soft-spoken boy-man beneath -- film fans have been curious about the films director Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In America"") whose commitment to classical deeply humanist filmmaking would seem to be at odds with the grislier values of gangsta rap. Whether its because Sheridan indeed wasnt a good match with the material or because 50 Cent is such a poor actor or because a life of crime -- which at the end of the day is a life of base stupidity and greed -- is really quite boring ""Get Rich or Die Tryin "" aint rich its just tryin. The movie opens with a very cool credits sequence set to the pounding strains of ""Ill Whip Ya Head Boy"" (the soundtrack features all new songs) while an image caught in a rearview mirror shakes with each vibration of the bass line. But the street-level energy of those shots quickly gives way to an episodic -- and one suspects revisionist -- retelling of 50 Cents life in which the rapper plays a character named Marcus an enterprising hustler who only reluctantly resorts to violence. Familiar figures show up in fictionalized versions including 50 Cents real-life rival Ja Rule here embodied by a ""wanksta"" named Dangerous. Unlike ""8 Mile"" a similarly conceived film in which Eminem -- 50 Cents real-life patron and producer -- portrayed his years coming up in Detroit ""Get Rich or Die Tryin "" barely features any rap. (Viewers who want to see 50 Cent perform must slog through two hours of his increasingly tiresome thug-life story until the movies closing credits and forget about hits like ""In Da Club."") Instead Sheridan and screenwriter Terence Winter have inexplicably focused on the tiresome machinations of the drug trade wasting a lot of time on a feud with some Colombians and 50 Cents -- er Marcuss -- relationship with a self-important crime boss played by the great Bill Duke affecting his best Brandoesque whisper. Whether hes at a party or in prison Marcus dutifully writes his raps at one point ignoring a throw-down in his own house to scratch out lyrics in a marble-covered schoolbook. Later he gets together with a childhood girlfriend (the lovely Joy Bryant) who not only brings out his teddy-bear sweetness but after she gives birth to his son his ambition. Marcus always manages to stay above the most violent murderous parts of the fray but 50 Cent himself remains oddly distant and detached as a performer. The audience is supposed to take it on faith that with his admittedly disarming smile and shy demeanor he isnt simply a hood who got lucky but a warrior with the soul of a poet. Even if thats true it doesnt necessarily make for exciting cinema. In fact the movie only perks up about an hour and a half in when Terrence Howard -- who played a similar much more engaging character in last summers ""Hustle amp; Flow"" -- arrives as Marcuss prison-buddy-turned-manager. (The scene in which they meet looks like a prison fight as imagined by D.H. Lawrence by way of Larry Kramer.) This year Howard has joined Peter Sarsgaard as one of the best reasons to go to the movies; as he did in ""Hustle"" and ""Crash"" he delivers an indelible performance here as an aspirant to the American Dream who has all the verve humor and congenital charisma that the films star so sorely lacks. Throughout ""Get Rich or Die Tryin "" Marcus and his boys engage in the ritualized aggression celebrated in gangsta rap always couched in the rhetoric of respect potency and dominance. (The young Marcus played by Marc John Jefferies plasters his bedroom with Public Enemy and KRS-One posters wistful reminders that rap was once a vehicle for provocative agitprop rather than macho posturing.) But the pumped-up poetry has always seemed to be more about self-mythologizing than authentic street cred and ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" sadly is no different. As Howards character says in the films first genuinely observant moment ""I see you have a little Napoleon thing goin on there."" Word. Get Rich or Die Tryin (134 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong violence pervasive profanity drug content sexuality and nudity.

The massively successful rapper who goes by the nom de multi-platinum-album gangsta 50 Cent was 8 years old when his drug-dealing mother was shot to death in 1983; there was no father in the picture. Raised by his grandparents in Queens young Jackson knew early on that he wanted to be a rapper -- this was the era of Run-DMC after all -- but he took to drug dealing as a day job and got paid. He did jail time. In 2000 he was shot nine times. Jackson recovered and continued to write his experience-based lyrics never flagging in his confident hustle for fame and especially fortune. The grittiness of his resume the charming brazenness of his ambition and the immobile grandeur of his defiant unsmiling stare impressed rocketing colleague and fellow stoneface Eminem enough to call Mr. Cent ""my favorite rapper of the moment"" and ""the only one keepin it real."" And the endorsement changed Jacksons life A major-label deal followed along with gargantuan album sales awards a business empire and enough scratch to buy a multimillion-dollar 50000-square-foot Connecticut mansion formerly owned by Mike Tyson. Now theres this Get Rich or Die Tryin a rags-to-riches bio-inspired pic with a title taken from Jacksons debut album and high hopes extrapolated from the success of Eminems own impressive movie debut 8 Mile. In Get Rich the man who once declaimed ""Im the boss on this boat you can call me Skipper/The way I turn money over you should call me Flipper"" plays a star-to-be called Marcus from the Bronx (not Queens) hood. Hes got a murdered mother a felony rap sheet bullets in his body etc. Eventually he renounces his bad old ways and focuses his energies and battering-ram charms on winning friends (or at least demanding respect) influencing people making music and becoming r-i-c-h. The fictionalized version of 50 Cent is also given Joy Bryant as a ladylike girlfriend Hustle amp; Flows Terrence Howard (in yet another great 2005 performance) as a colorful prison buddy and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje from Lost as a mentor only slightly less flamboyantly evil or intimately entangled with our heros family history than Darth Vader. The screenwriter is Terence Winter acclaimed for his work on The Sopranos. The outstanding cinematographer is Declan Quinn who creates a gorgeously crumbly 1970s Bronx in colors of dirt and blood. The director is Jim Sheridan who although less known for his hip-hop cred than for his work with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot and In the Name of the Father has announced himself as a rap aficionado who sees in Jacksons story ""pretty powerful and interesting material to put on film."" But Get Rich or Die Tryin is neither powerful nor interesting. It is (distressingly as if what the heck does it matter since 50 Cent sells himself and the tie-in soundtrack album too) a run-of-the-mill movie ""product"" developed as part of a 50 Cent marketing plan the opposite in style and wiles of Curtis Hansons 8 Mile; its got the undifferentiated bring-in-da-noise pacing of a work for hire. It is also surely the first movie Ive ever seen that incorporates graphic prison violence (complete with an Oz-like naked brawl among showering inmates) graphic make-up sex (more nakedness this time gauzy and femme-friendly) unrelentingly raw language and the close-range shooting of the central character played by a man reenacting his own worst moment in real life -- and yet nothing shocks distresses or even registers. Which is itself you know kind of shocking. Really Jackson shouldnt be blamed for this His 50 Cent persona -- the glower threat eroticism and up-from-hell ballsiness of it -- works like gangbusters on stage in music videos in the recording studio and at the bank. Not raised to let softness out though and not at ease with the free exchange of facial expressions the centerpiece of the show looks exposed and vulnerable on screen and not in a good way. Hes clearly working hard approaching his gig with discipline. And yet under Sheridans watch in a production that regularly brings the camera in close on opacity hes regularly overmatched in two ways. For one thing the overbusy script with its many anecdotes to tell (the movie runs a baggy two hours) manages to distract from Jacksons importance in his own story rather than intensify it. And for another the wattage of the novice actor just cant match the brightness of his more experienced costars particularly Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Howard who are as delighted in and enthusiastic about the men they play however good or evil as Jackson appears to be ambivalent about representing himself. Theres nothing at all wrong with wanting to get rich as opposed to dying but not every business plan requires a feature film to achieve that American gangsta goal.

Mildly engaging this lurchingly structured story is a longshot to generate significant cross-over. Even though its inspired by the real life of rap megastar Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" has the pulpy feel of fictional gangsta melodrama that plays like a contrived cross between ""New Jack City"" and ""Hustle amp; Flow."" Mildly engaging but very far from being for 50 Cent what ""8 Mile"" was for Eminem this lurchingly structured story of survival against the odds looks to get off to a strong start thanks to the singers large following but is a longshot to generate significant cross-over or the conversion of new fans. Although 50 Cent is the big story here the pic is notable as a departure for director Jim Sheridan inasmuch as it marks his first feature on a non-Irish subject. All the same ""Get Rich"" can be seen as something of a companion piece to Sheridans last film ""In America"" in its view of striving against the tide toward vindication and success through self-reliance in New York City. Violent grabber of an opening has Marcus (50 Cent) and cohorts barging into a Latino-run money laundering office to pull off a big robbery a fiasco that leads to Marcus lying on the street about to be shot. Narration and a flashback then send the action to the 70s Bronx where young Marcus (a convincing Marc John Jefferies) who doesnt know who his father was is being raised by drug dealing mama Katrina (Serena Reeder) with the help of other relatives. When Katrina is killed in a turf war Marcus starts selling dime bags and buys a gun. At a little more than 20 minutes in 50 Cent takes over as Marcus who pursues the gangsta lifestyle by assembling his own crew of three cohorts and working under the auspices of local drug kingpin Levar (Bill Duke) and Levars volatile henchman Majestic (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Intermittent battles with Colombian dealers thin the ranks but Marcus gets fully into the gangsta life ""gettin paid and gettin laid"" buying a white Mercedes with cash (but without a drivers license) reconnecting with childhood sweetie Charlene (Joy Bryant) and toying with being a rapper under the moniker Young Caesar. The life eventually trips Marcus up however and he lands in the slammer where hes rescued during a vicious shower room knife attack by the loquacious Bama (Terrence Howard). In solitary Marcus realizes he must ""express myself or die"" and with Bama proposing to be his manager Marcus begins scratching lyrics on his cell wall. Back on the outside life tears at Marcus from every direction Majestic expects him to return to the fold as an important drug dealer Charlene delivers him a son and Marcus and Bama try to get the rap career going. In extremis without a record deal Marcus undertakes the botched robbery of the opening and proceeds as 50 Cent famously did to have nine bullets pumped into him. From there its a story of resurrection from the left-for-dead of summoning up the strength and determination to forge an American self-made success story that Ayn Rand herself would have been proud of. Nevertheless ""Get Rich"" spends far more time on the criminal story mechanics than on creating a revealing portrait of the artist as a young man. ""8 Mile"" managed to convey to the uninitiated a strong sense of what made Eminem tick the real life elements that fed his work and the circumstances under which he tested and developed his material. (An Eminem-like figure named Dangerous hovers inscrutably in the background of Marcus story.) In ""Get Rich"" Marcus wants to be a rapper from an early age but what drives him musically (as opposed to commercially) is vague and insufficient evidence from his work is offered to convince the uncommitted observer of his musical talent. Unlike with ""8 Mile"" or for that matter ""Hustle amp; Flow"" theres no moment that wins the audience over to Marcus artistic cause or by extension to the film. One is left with the feeling of having watched an imitation of life rather than something close to the real thing no matter how accurately the script by ""Sopranos"" vet Terence Winter may reflect 50 Cents own. As a bigscreen leading man 50 Cent possesses a degree of charisma and appeal. But he cant convey emotional turmoil the electricity of artistic ferment or a sense of unpredictable danger resulting in just moderate overall impact. When Howard finally explodes on the scene an hour in he forcibly reminds what a real actor can bring to a role. Bryant is smartly appealing as Marcus sweetheart while the thesps playing the villains lay it on pretty thick Akinnuoye-Agbaje with leers and taunts and the dapper Duke as a hoarse whisperer worthy of Brandos Godfather. Pic is dark to the point of murky inscrutability at times and the overall look is unattractive. Other tech contributions are routine. Only real performance footage of 50 Cent comes alongside the end credits. Get Rich or Die TryinProductionA Paramount release of an Interscope/Shady/Aftermath and MTV production.
