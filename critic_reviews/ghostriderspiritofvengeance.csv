A single viewing makes it obvious why Marvel Enterprises would move forward with the sequel to a feature whose box office performance was underwhelming. By making this film they are reminding us what a bad comic book movie is really like thereby elevating the relative quality of their recent stretch of mediocre efforts and lowering the bar for Marvels big summer twosome The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. Also I know Nic Cage is in financial distress and has to film pretty much every screenplay with which he is presented but doesnt the law of averages demand that somewhere along the way if only by accident he would stumble upon a good movie? In some circles Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance has been referred to as more of a ""reboot"" than a ""sequel"" although Im not aware of any reboots that have featured the same actor in the lead role. Admittedly pretty much everyone else both in front of the camera and behind the scenes has been jettisoned leaving minimal traces of the first Ghost Rider. The new directors Neveldine amp; Taylor are the Crank guys and the screenplay is credited to two TV writers (Scott M. Gimple amp; Seth Hoffman) and one of the men behind Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy (David S. Goyer who at some point probably tried desperately to get his name removed). Columbia Pictures showed admirable restraint in not selling Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance as being ""from the writer of The Dark Knight"" although that would have been technically accurate. A certain amount of cheese is acceptable even desirable in a movie such as this. Some of the most entertaining action/adventure movies layer it on like a pizza. In the case of Ghost Rider Sprit of Vengeance Neveldine amp; Taylor turn the ""campiness"" dial to 11 with as much limburger as they can gather but they forget a key element - the ""action/adventure"" one. This is a boring movie. The over-the-top outlandishness cant disguise that the whole 95 minutes represent one big snooze-fest. Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance is essentially a mixture of nonsensical story elements bad special effects and endless exposition. People talk and talk and talk like theyre stuck in a parody of a Dan Brown novel and they simply wont shut up. It can be a little difficult to decipher the plot because the screenplay reads like a comic book with a bunch of pages ripped out. I dont know whether a lot of material was removed from the final cut or whether it never made sense from the beginning. I suppose when you start with the premise that the lead character has a righteous demon trapped inside that causes him to burst into flame at inopportune moments anything goes. The starting point is that Johnny Blaze (Cage) hiding out in Eastern Europe where its cheaper to film desperately wants to be rid of the curse that changes him into Ghost Rider. Enter Moreau (Idris Elba) who claims to belong to a sect of ascetic monks who can rid him of the Rider. As payment for this Johnny has to escort sulky pre-teen Danny (Fergus Riordan) and his hot mother Nadya (Violante Placido) to a monastery while being pursued by Satan a.k.a. Mr. Roarke (Ciaran Hinds who never once utters the line ""Welcome to Fantasy Island"") and his henchman Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth). For some reason Cage seems trapped in movies about demons and devils the first Ghost Rider Season of the Witch Drive Angry and now this one. Neveldine amp; Taylor should have used Drive Angry as a template - it recognized what it was and never tried to be anything more. The chief problem with Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance is that it never embraces its utter awfulness. As a result its impossible to enjoy on any level. Its a complete mess. For acting to be this bad in movie not directed by Michael Bay or George Lucas it has to be intentional. Nicolas Cage cackles like a constipated chicken and Ciaran Hinds interprets Satan as a twisted imitation of Mr. Potter from Its a Wonderful Life with a bad case of pink eye. Violante Placido sounds like shes speaking English phonetically and Johnny Whitworth tries desperately to chew scenery with more gusto than Cage but finds himself overmatched. Still even though everyone seems on board in this attempt to earn an ensemble cast Razzie its less enjoyable than it should be - well most of the time. I wont spend much time on the 3-D because whats the point? In the ever-growing collection of 3-D offerings this is among the most ill-conceived of selections. Its not the worst 3-D I have seen (in fact it avoids a lot of the most common 3-D sins) but it adds absolutely nothing except a 3 surcharge. Im not going to recommend seeking out a 2-D version however since the only iteration of Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance worth exploring is one in 0-D. Comic book movies no matter how disappointing generally manage to deliver at least halfway competent action scenes but thats not the case here. It could have something to do with the shoestring budget that makes Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance appear to have been shot using a maxed out credit card with a low limit. In this production ""Action"" typically refers to a silly skeleton looking like a neighborhood haunted house reject twirling a fiery chain that immolates everything it touches. Exciting no? ""Anticlimactic"" doesnt even begin to describe the ending although it features something no other movie to-date can boast a car chase with Satan. Ill admit to having laughed a few times during Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance although I have no idea if the things that caused me to chortle were intended to be funny or not. Its that kind of movie. Even if the whole thing was intended as a send-up of comic books it doesnt work. Parodies should be engaging not sleep-inducing. This is one of those production disasters that offers little to bad movie aficionados and less to those who want to experience a coherent narrative. Limburger cheese is often referred to as stinking like dirty feet and thats a kind way to describe the stench given off by this film.

(Sony Pictures Imageworks) BY Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday February 17 2012 838 PM Title GHOST RIDER SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE Film Info With Nicolas Cage Idris Elba. A tortured loner remains inhabited by a demon. Directors Mark Neveldine Brian Taylor (135). PG-13 violence language. ""Im the guy who made the deal with the devil"" Nicolas Cages character tells us at the start of ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" and its awfully easy to hear a true-life confession in those words. Whether Cage is still paying off castles appeasing the IRS or rebuilding his comic book collection its clear hes decided for now to trade his talent for cold hard cash. Fortunately Cages B-movies tend to be truly ridiculous-and a ridiculous movie is always more fun than a blandly mediocre one. He knows this too and deserves actual credit for committing to so much inanity. With his over-the-top delivery and operatically intense facial expressions theres no way anyone could accuse him of phoning this one in. Its also a relief that directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor omit the aggressively nasty edge they bring to the sadistic ""Crank"" movies. Still theres so little substance here that the movie barely stands on its own let alone as a sequel. At night in the presence of evil die-hard stunt rider Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider a bounty hunter of rogue demons. (Sony Pictures Imageworks) Once again Cage is Johnny Blaze a tormented soul living a dual existence inside Johnny is the Ghost Rider a fiery demon compelled to destroy any evil he can find. His mission this time is to save 13-year-old Danny (Fergus Riordan) who turns out to be the son of Roarke (Ciaran Hinds) the Devil himself. The saintly Moreau (Idris Elba) points Johnny towards Danny and his mom (Violante Placido) just as theyre on the run from Roarke. Though Johnny arrives in time to rescue them from Roarkes sleazy henchman (Johnny Whitworth) Satan always has some surprises in store. If only the screenwriters could say the same. The original ""Ghost Rider"" failed to impress many fans of the comic books on which it was based and this one feels like a 10th-generation Xerox. Even the effects are likely to leave you cold turns out a flaming skull is only scary the first time around. But the filmmakers are wise to rely heavily on humor and Cage is as droll as ever. Theres no movie without him which is both a compliment and a fans lament it seems like his own deal with the devil has already lasted an eternity.

Hardly the worst discount-rate Nicolas Cage actioner to be released in the film calendars dead zone ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" reps a marginal improvement on the series first installment and contains enough idiosyncrasies to launch it ahead of the moribund ""Season of the Witch"" which lumbered through theaters around this time last year. Yet the pic is still much too rickety slapdash and surprisingly dull to qualify as a good barrel-bottom pleasure. 3D ticket prices and dearth of competition should help first-weekend B.O. with a subsequent dropoff all but assured. Directed by the Mark Neveldine-Brian Taylor team responsible for ""Crank"" one of the most enjoyably trashy actioners in recent memory ""Spirit of Vengeance"" imports only a few whiffs of that films Red Bull-drenched anarchy. Idris Elba for one goes for the gusto in his absurd role as an alcoholic motorcycle-riding French monk and Cage is gifted a sublimely extended freakout moment that should slot in perfectly after ""Wicker Man"" outtakes in one of the stars hall-of-shame highlight reels on YouTube. The rest however refuses to adhere to this what-the-hell principle stranding its players in a muddily shot morass. Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze a onetime stunt motorcyclist who once made a deal with the devils earthly incarnation the prosaically monikered Rourke (Ciaran Hinds) and now suffers from periodic bouts of demonological transformation turning into a biker with a fiery skull. At least thats the backstory. Cage actually spends the vast majority of the film in mournful human form starting off in hiding in Eastern Europe (the onscreen titles dont get any more specific than that) where rebel monk Moreau (Elba) tracks him down. Moreau needs his help finding a young boy (Fergus Riordan) who may be the devils spawn and promises to reverse Blazes curse if he complies. That this accentless boy has a gorgeous heavily accented Roma mother (Violante Placido); is pursued by a gaggle of indistinguishable thugs (led by the perversely nonthreatening Johnny Whitworth); and gets to re-enact the unlikely-father-figure bonding scenes from ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" with Cage is all par for course. The final setpiece finally gives the audience its moneys worth with a decently staged freeway chase but until that point the action sequences bear the brunt of the films budgetary limitations. Shot with low upward-facing angles and frequently cutting away to acid-trip dream sequences the fighting is hard to wrap ones head around and the titular heros movements are so blurred by jump cuts and quick closeups that he rarely comes into focus. Given a franchise based around a flaming chain-wielding biker-warrior hellspawn its strange that the filmmakers should be so quick to push the character into the margins. ""Spirit of Vengeance"" is weighted down for long stretches in the middle as it starts to treat its own religious hokum plotline with undue seriousness. But then again the script is probably best when it steers clear of attempted humor as Cages ""youre the devils baby-mama"" line reading and a 10-years-too-late Jerry Springer joke attest to. (Even the classless yet potentially riotous sight of Ghost Rider urinating flame fails to draw a laugh.) The f/x supervisors do yeomans work disguising the films limited resources and the 3D is adequate enough even though the color palette ranges from murky to washed-out with plenty of distracting lens flares in between.

Credit Columbia Pictures We now know why it has been such a mild winter in much of the United States. Nicolas Cage has been warming the atmosphere by riding around with his head and motor vehicles on fire again.Mr. Cage is back as Johnny Blaze in a new ""Ghost Rider"" film subtitled ""Spirit of Vengeance."" Theres good news the movie has a bit more coherence and considerably more humor than the first installment released in 2007. And humorously is the best way to view this silly enterprise in which Mr. Cages character (based on the Marvel comics) acts as a bounty hunter of sorts for the Devil and has a tendency to burst into flames.Here Johnny a former stunt motorcyclist has the task of keeping a boy safe. Not just any boy; this one Danny (Fergus Riordan) has semi-infernal parentage and his biological father has big plans for the lad.Johnny sets a terrible example for cyclists everywhere by riding without a helmet himself -- surely flameproof ones are available -- and letting Danny do so as well. The film though has some redeeming qualities including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order.Its rough going but that doesnt stop Danny from asking Johnny important questions like what happens if he has to urinate while hes on fire. The resulting visual gag will probably amuse the target ""Ghost Rider"" audience which is apparently large (the original film took in more than 115 million domestically) but perhaps not that discriminating.The funniest moment though comes courtesy of Blackout (Johnny Whitworth) an evildoer whose mere touch causes decay. Hes having trouble getting something to eat because when he grabs a piece of bread or fruit it shrivels. But one well-known snack food proves that some ingredients are beyond even the power of hell itself.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Supernatural superhero Johnny Blaze returns this time to save a child wanted by the Devil. RATING PG-13 (violence language gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE Surprisingly entertaining with impressive visuals snazzy directing and another gonzo acting job from Cage. CAST Nicolas Cage Ciaran Hinds Violante Placido LENGTH 136 If you think youve seen Nicolas Cage overact you havent seen ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" the sequel to 2007s ""Ghost Rider"" itself a high-water mark in Cages emotive career. Reprising his role as possessed biker Johnny Blaze Cage leaves no neck tendon unpopped whenever he transforms into The Rider a flaming skeleton cackling atop a roaring Hog. Perhaps you expected as much from Cage (""Drive Angry"" ""Bangkok Dangerous"") but you might be surprised at how enjoyable ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" manages to be. The best stuntmen in this action flick are its directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (""Crank"" ""Gamer"") who inject the movie with unrelenting violence yet never tip into gratuitous splatter -- a nifty way of retaining a PG-13 rating for their target audience. The result is an entertaining slice of teenage heavy-metal heaven. advertisement | advertise on newsday The first film is essentially forgotten Theres a new Devil Roarke (Ciaran Hinds nearly out-Caging Cage) and no mention of Johnnys old sweetheart (Eva Mendes). A new woman Nadia (Violante Placido) is mostly a plot device Shes the mother of young Danny (Fergus Riordan) whom Johnny is trying to save from Roarkes clutches. Idris Elba plays Moreau a gun-toting priest who joins the mission. There are gruesome but cartoony deaths. But Neveldine-Taylor as theyre professionally known are focused on spectacle filling the screen with flaming machinery and massive clouds of tar-black smoke. Theyre having so much fun setting everything on fire that they forget to put Nadia the films only female in a revealing outfit.

If captured the kid will become a superpowered vessel for evil on earth and nobody -- not the wine-guzzling French mercenary played by Idris Elba and certainly not the accursed biker-cum-demon Johnny Blaze (Cage) -- wants that to happen. Like the first Ghost Rider movie this one burns plenty of rubber trying to swerve around plot holes and thinly written characters. As a showcase for random acts of badassery the movie has its moments like when the Ghost Rider pees fire or eats a flurry of bullets and pukes them back in a molten stream. Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the team behind the raucously entertaining Crank movies clearly set out to push the series -- and its star -- to new heights of biker-gang lunacy. But most of the movies action-horror set pieces play like lame Gwar music-video outtakes and Cages signature mix of irony and off-the-rails mugging only works when you can see the actors face. In Ghost Rider form his character is just a skeletal automaton with neither a tongue nor a cheek to put it in.

Thats the good news. The bad news is that this sequel which wants to wow us with its unrestrained hyper-stylized WTF-ness is way too disposable for its own good. Lets not even worry too much about the plot which is some kind of cross between The Golden Child and Every Other Horror Movie Ever Made (Satan has fathered a child; he wants to transfer himself into this healthier younger vessel; a renegade monk played by Idris Elba enlists a reluctant Blazes help in protecting the child from this demonic parent; much screaming ensues; yada yada). No the real tragedy of Spirit of Vengeance is that it has all the pieces in place for total zonked-out craziness but stops short. The first Ghost Rider film lucked into a kind of ironic charm; too silly to work as a serious superhero movie (whatever that may mean) it caught Cage right at the moment when he was shedding his A-List persona and fully embracing his status as loony cult figure. The new film to its credit doesnt make even a halfhearted attempt at respectability. While the original was directed by anonymous journeyman Mark Steven Johnson (who gave us the instantly forgettable Daredevil and later um When in Rome) this new one is helmed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the deranged visionaries behind the nutty Crank movies a series whose unchecked visual sense and sonic playfulness had kind of a coked-out magnificence. Youd think that the combination of Cage Neveldine/Taylor a Marvel-sized budget and a strong supporting cast (including alongside Hinds a very welcome Christopher Lambert) would result in something special but sadly the directors are mostly in service mode here They certainly fancy up the proceedings with their brand of unmotivated camerawork and in-your-face editing choices and even toss in some animated bits early on but for the most part they stick to the thoroughly generic storyline outlined above. The Crank films are a maze of almost Dickensian distractions and digressions but Spirit of Vengeance is so focused and as a result so impoverished that you actually feel bad for Cage. The actor tries to bring the weird (though at this point one wonders if he can even do anything else) but the film more often than not leaves him high and dry saddling him with standard-issue action hero lines and boilerplate action set-pieces. Neveldine/Taylor have never been known for their flair for performance but ironically enough its when the action stops and the actors take center stage that the film comes close to shining. Hinds can do grim and playful at the same time; he gives Satan some gravitas even as he winks at us. He also brings the best out of Cage and you want to see more of them snarling at each other. The result is a sad final irony This most knowing of comic book movie franchises doesnt go far enough and you leave the theater wondering if it maybe should have pulled back all the way and just let its actors have the day.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The 2007 film Ghost Rider had many of the elements necessary for crackerjack entertainment or at least goofy guilty fun an iconic morally conflicted Marvel Comics superhero inspired by the early-70s popularity of Evel Knievel; narration by Sam Elliott; and a seemingly ideal leading man in famously comic-book-loving kook Nicolas Cage one of the most entertaining crazy-persons in the entertainment business. Yet the best journeyman director Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil When In Rome) could manage was slick mediocrity. The 2011 sequel is even more promising in the abstract. Johnson has been replaced by the uneven but sometimes gloriously manic awesomely over-the-top team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (Crank Gamer Crank High Voltage). David S. Goyer a prolific screenwriter and genre vet with credits on all three Christopher Nolan Batman movies provided the story and co-wrote the script. And the charismatic Idris Elba debuts in a key role as an alcoholic priest who recruits Cages unique services. Yet instead of elevating the franchise Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance ends up squandering even more potential. An alternately exhausted and twitchy Cage returns as a motorcycle-riding hotshot who sold his soul to the devil to save his cancer-stricken father decades ago and is now cursed to change into a rage-filled monster with a flaming skull for a head in the presence of evil. Elbas tortured priest offers to free Cage from his curse in exchange for tracking down a mysterious little boy (Fergus Riordan) with a dark history and emissaries from his Satanic old man (Ciaran Hinds) hot on his tail. In spite of the series big budget the hero in flaming-skull mode still resembles an unimaginative CGI version of something that might be found in a cheap haunted house. Even worse the character is surprisingly colorless whether Cage is playing him or hes handed over to the CGI folks. That lack of personality afflicts this surprisingly generic film as a whole which shouldnt be a problem for a glorified B-movie about a flaming demonic hero played by Nicolas Cage in a 3D sequel directed by Neveldine/Taylor. In a distressing omen of whats to come the first big action setpiece finds Cage interminably standing in front of a group of interchangeable heavies giving other henchmen more than enough time to grab more guns and/or get away. That irritating lingering may have its roots in the comic-book versions ""penance stare""--a power that forces bad guys to experience all the pain theyve caused others--but onscreen it just results in a disappointing protagonist whos nowhere near as badass as he should be. The character is matched to a Cage performance thats isnt much fun; it plays like a limp retread of both his underwhelming turn in the first film and the similar but much more enjoyable Drive Angry. At best the Neveldine/Taylor team is capable of transforming ingeniously trashy premises into pop art but here they inherit a promisingly trashy franchise and fail to give it the allure and go-for-broke energy of superior trash.

"Cage spins wheels on Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Cage spins wheels on Ghost Rider Spirit of VengeanceThe Ghost Rider sequel promises more than it actually delivers with Nicolas Cages Johnny Blaze again riding to the rescue.February 18 2012|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" covers the back story of... (Columbia Pictures )It has the makings of a trash-film lovers idea of heaven. In this corner the filmmaking team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor credited as Neveldine/Taylor purveyors of willful gleefully disreputable movies like ""Crank"" and ""Crank 2 High Voltage."" They are smart enough to know better and self-consciously shameless enough to go there anyway. And in this corner is Nicolas Cage who has over time transformed into a performer of such ridiculous earnestness that it is impossible to unravel whether he gets it or not. Cage is the opposite of irony. Putting the two together for the sequel ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" is like a laboratory experiment on how often a movie can spin from bad to good and back again. The new film covers the back story of how Johnny Blaze (Cage) went from daredevil motorcycle rider to head-on-fire supernatural avenger in a smartly done credit sequence. Things pick up quickly when a drunken French priest (Idris Elba) enlists Blaze and his powers to rescue a Gypsy grifter (Violante Placido) and her son from the mysterious deal-making businessman (CiarA!n Hinds) who also rendered Blaze into his current condition. As Blaze asks succinctly ""Youre the devils baby-mama?"" Like any deal with the devil ""Spirit of Vengeance"" at times makes a viewer regret what they wished for. Working with a script credited to Scott M. Gimple Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer leaves Neveldine and Taylor adding their oddball touches around the edges while simply stringing together a series of thudding action set-pieces. The duos innate outrageousness also feels neutralized by the films PG-13 rating. An effect in which Cages skull hollows out into an empty-eyed death-mask is both comic and eerie. The first ""Ghost Rider"" film directed by Mark Steven Johnson was sort of a fizzy goof the kind of movie where you dont expect much and then think ""Hey that was actually kind of fun."" ""Spirit of Vengeance"" though is undone by increased expectations as promising more only makes it feel they are somehow delivering less. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review True GritDecember 22 2010Movie review Kuroneko (Black Cat)November 19 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentMark Steven JohnsonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-ghost-rider-20120218,0,1897221.story?track=rss",200,ghostriderspiritofvengeance9,ghostriderspiritofvengeance,latimes

Sadly the results of that collaboration are ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" which sees Neveldine and Taylor succumbing to the Curse of Cage rendering what might have been a gloriously loony concept into a fairly pedestrian supernatural action flick shot in some of the less attractive corners of budget-friendly Eastern Europe. This is a movie about a flaming skeleton that rides a motorcycle -- theres no excuse for it to be this dull. Also read Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance to Battle Safe House for No. 1 Box Office Spot In the previous ""Ghost Rider"" movie (and in the Marvel Comics that spawned it) stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Cage) became Satans errand boy as the result of a deal to save the life of Johnnys dying father. (And you know how deals with the devil turn out.) The first movie ended with Johnny being let out of the bargain but choosing to keep his hell-born powers so that he could use them for good. Thats just one of many plot elements that ""Spirit of Vengeance"" chooses to ignore. (Also absent this time around are Eva Mendes as Johnnys true love as well as Johnnys affection for the music of The Carpenters.) In the sequel/reboot Johnny wants the Ghost Rider exorcised because he has no control over the creature and cannot stop it from taking away the souls of anyone with whom it comes into contact. Boozy priest Moreau (Idris Elba) finds Johnny somewhere in Romania and offers to drive the Ghost Rider from his soul in exchange for Johnny finding young Danny (Fergus Riordan) and handing him over for safe-keeping. Danny and his mother Nadya (the oxymoronically-named Violante Placido) have been on the run from black-SUV-driving goons out to take the kid on behalf of the creepy Roarke (Ciaran Hinds) the guy with whom Johnny once made his dark pact. (Another switcheroo from the first movie.) Also read Ghost Rider 2 Poised to Ignite a Lackluster Franchise That should be enough to let the directors go buck-wild with one eye-popping chase and fight sequence after another but the action is oddly muted. For directors best known for two movies about a guy who has to keep his heart from stopping theres a decided absence of adrenaline here. Even Cage seems restrained except for one gloriously hammy scene in which Blaze tries to keep the Ghost Rider from emerging -- its a Jekyll-and-Hyde moment thats insanely absurd and overdone yes but it winds up standing out as one of the films best sequences solely for not succumbing to the tameness that blankets the rest of the movie. Usually you can count on the slumming British actors in movies like this to bother to give a performance but not here Elba staggers around with a Pepe LePew-level French accent (his pronunciation of ""vengeance"" is pretty hilarious granted) while Hinds does the kind of embarrassing acting usually associated with...well Nicolas Cage. ""Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance"" doesnt just fail to live up to the original ""Ghost Rider"" -- its not even a very good Nicolas Cage movie. Youll actually have a better time renting ""Trespass"" or ""Drive Angry"" instead. And thats saying something. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The original ""Ghost Rider"" was at least a flaming mess but the followup is a cruddy bore alternating static talky scenes in which the characters explain the back story to each other (you wont care) to perfunctory abbreviated action scenes (you wont thrill). Its subtitle should have been Spirit of Downgrade what with the budget trimmed back by 40 percent and its bleak cheap-looking gray-brown locations in Eastern Europe the place where movie careers go to die. The only part of this movie anyones ever going to remember is the pair of scenes in which Ghost Rider pees flame although if the next installment is going to treat us to what happens when the Rider has to go no. 2 I think Id rather sit through ""Season of the Witch"" again. Tormented by his uncontrollable inner hothead a sort of flame-broiled Incredible Hulk Devil-cursed Johnny Blaze (Cage) flees to the Balkans for no particular reason. His dull sidekick (Idris Elba doing a dodgy French accent) informs him that a kid named Danny (Fergus Riordan) is being pursued by the Satanic Roarke (Ciaran Hinds) who tricked Johnny Blaze into becoming Ghost Rider. But if Johnny can save the boy his curse will be lifted. In that case hell be a regular guy again instead of a flaming hog-riding skeleton who gets to prowl the night breathing fire on bad guys spitting machine-gun bullets and whipping the malevolent with his motorcycle chain of righteousness but Johnny seems to think its a good deal so off he goes. The girl the kids hottie Gypsy mom is played by Violante Placido (see what I mean about budget cuts? They couldnt even afford Eva Mendes again). The paternity of the boy is unclear until Johnny figures it out for us telling her ""Youre the Devils baby mama."" A mild and uninteresting villain working for the Devil Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) is also in pursuit but he has no supernatural powers so it isnt much of a fight when Ghost Rider shows up and shares his hellfire halitosis with Carrigans henchmen until their heads explode. Far too late in the story Carrigan turns into a demon himself a creep with the power to make everything he touches crumble to dust (nothing can survive his touch except a Twinkie a gag that is the only funny one in the film). But his big scenes of mass corrosion merely add to the general sense of rust and decay about the production. The horror isnt scary the action isnt rousing (the Devils bodyguards can be distracted by simply throwing a bottle of wine in the air and then shooting them) and the comedy is not only lame but also undercuts any sense of demonic danger. ""So that happened"" Johnny Blaze says after one of Duraflame Dude tantrums. Other attempts at laugh lines sound merely like the sarcasm of the middle schoolers at whom the movie is aimed ""Im sorry did that hurt?"" ""Sorry Jackass but Im dead"" ""What are [the Devils] plans for his son? Is he putting money away for college what?"" The directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor previously made the hilariously hyperactive action comedy ""Crank"" and I never thought Id see a movie of theirs that needed to pick up the pace but the long stretches without special effects seem to fill no purpose except to drag the running time across the 90-minute mark. Theyre like that piece of extra bun in the middle of the Big Mac undisguised filler. As for Cage his Johnny Blaze seems less tortured than a torturer with the audience being the victim. His jaw clenched and eyes bulging Cage tries to shout some life into the character as he explains that his alter ego is always with him and ""Hes scraping at the door SCRAPING AT THE DOOR"" Youd think a guy who made both ""Raising Arizona"" and ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" would have an easier time playing ""internal conflict."" Cage has become the acting equivalent of one of those South American dictators who keeps ordering up more parades in honor of his greatness as the people starve and seethe. What international task force can be sent to depose him from the multiplex marquees?

Not in Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance a dishwater dull sequel to the hellishly bad 2007 original but in a special appearance a few weeks back on Saturday Night Live in which Andy Samberg brilliantly played Cage and Cage did a Cage so wonderfully demented you could forgive him anything even Bangkok Dangerous. Citing the Cage rule for Cage movies the actor clearly stated that ""every line of dialogue must be either whispered or screamed."" That definitely applies to Ghost Rider 2 in which Cage repeats his Marvel Comics role as Johnny Blaze the motorcycle stunt driver who makes a deal with the devil a deal that keeps turning him into a flaming skeleton head. I too felt my head would explode if I had to endure another minute of this blather from Cage and directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. As for the 3D Ive never seen worse.

Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance embraces that image quite literally in its attempt to up the edge and humor of Johnny Blazes supernatural exploits after 2007s criminally bland origin story but directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have nonetheless churned out an aggressively mediocre improvement on the first film that will also have the unlikely burden of remaining ranked behind Raw as far as on-screen depictions of fire-peeing are concerned. An animated prologue reminds viewers that once-desperate daredevil Blaze (Nicolas Cage) made a pact with the Devil which results in his unwilling transformation into a chopper-riding flame-wielding demon of the night whenever evil draws near. Now hiding out in Eastern Europe where its cheaper to shoot superhero sequels Blaze is approached by wino monk badass Moreau (Idris Elba playing it Fronch) with a proposition find an innocent boy (Fergus Riordan) that the Devil (Ciaran Hinds) intends to tap as his latest above-ground vessel in time for the nearing winter solstice and I can help to remove your curse. Its your basic protect-the-kid plot adhering strictly to the Terminator 2 blueprint (down to the protective mother played by Violante Placido) and echoing that of Cages last 3-D supernatural-action February release Drive Angry. Of course the 3-D is only of any use whenever the camera stays still but as with the previous helming efforts of Neveldine/Taylor (the more proudly provocative Crank 1 amp; 2 and Gamer) the action is often either jittery or roving shot from behind with the swerving rhythm that comes from one filming on rollerblades thus doing the format few favors. Their glib touches litter the screenplay (otherwise credited to Scott M. Gimple Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer) from quips about YouTube and the odd moment approximating a video game glitch to the aforementioned throwaway shot of Ghost Rider taking a flaming leak and nodding to the camera amid the unlikely inferno. Reliably eccentric by this point in his career Cage drops his jellybean-munching Elvis schtick from the first Ghost Rider but rarely ramps things up to match the consistently nonsensical directorial demeanor. The closest thing to a straight man around Elba doles out exposition and gunfire dutifully while Placido (The American) takes over for Eva Mendes in the eye-candy department. Johnny going the father-figure route means that were at least spared a requisite romantic subplot and his rapport with Riordan is well fine. Rounding out the villain end of things are Johnny Whitworth as the poor mans Matt Dillon who turns albino avenger halfway through; an ink-faced Christopher Lambert; and Hinds operating in what can only be called ""Demented Grandpa"" mode. The flaming head effects have improved in the past four years (if youre willing to split hairs on a charred skull that is) and the film generally throttles forward from showdown to showdown running twenty minutes shorter than its predecessor and all the better for it. Still its not quite a good time at the movies spastic to a fault. After two tries Im not sure what it would take to make a Ghost Rider outing thats worth a damn. Maybe some comic-book heroes are simply better left on the page.

A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure heros mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there. Its modest box-office prospects are helped by the absence of other superhero competitors during the next couple of weeks. Returning as the eponymous not-quite-hero Nicolas Cage spends stretches of the film on autopilot while waiting for scenes he deems worthy of his particular brand of crazy. Theyre not frequent enough to please the Cage aficionado but sequences in which the twitchy inappropriately giddy actor tries to choke back transformations into a bloodthirsty skeleton-on-fire are welcome in a film where often-charismatic co-stars Ciaran Hinds and Idris Elba are singing off-key. Cages Johnny Blaze hates being saddled with his super-powered alter ego and Spirit of Vengeance gives him a chance a la Superman II to unburden himself A French motorcycle-riding monk (Elba wearing unfortunate green contact lenses) offers to lift the curse if only Blaze will rescue a boy being pursued by the devil. It seems the boy Danny (Fergus Riordan) is actually the spawn of the dark lords Earthly incarnation (Hinds Roarke the trickster responsible for Blazes curse) and is now meant to be possessed by Daddy for good. Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor enjoy some of the oddball moments in Ghost Riders battles with various generic villains -- they cant bring the flaming skeleton head to life but shots of its gaping maw taunting evildoers have a quirky funhouse quality and somebody in a digital FX house should get a bonus for the bubbling tar on Ghost Riders motorcycle jacket. But the actual action surrounding these moments is sometimes incoherent especially an extravagantly murky showdown involving a mammoth piece of construction equipment and the plot tying one confrontation to the next is anything but on fire. If the screenplay is stale and contrived (Elbas monk knows everything about everything but cant guess the one twist no viewer will fail to foresee) the picture benefits from some eye-candy settings in Turkey and Romania -- which is not to say that this scenery is well served by Brandon Trosts photography or the limp 3D effects.
