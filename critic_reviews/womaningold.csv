"Small(er) Movie Roundup The Least Fast Least Furious Edition << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup The Least Fast Least Furious Edition Robert Viglasky/The Weinstein Company Movies April 7 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Woman in Gold Directed by Simon Curtis Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes. This one really works. Its immediately clear it has good pacing and the confidence of its stars. Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell the film recalls the years-long legal battle in the late 1990s and 2000s between a Los Angeles dress-shop owner named Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) and the Austrian government for custody of a Klimt painting the Nazis stole while excising and imprisoning the Jews of Vienna. The painting hung in the national museum of the Belvedere palace and it is considered the Mona Lisa of Austria. But the figure in it is Altmanns aunt Adele and it was at the Belvedere illegally. This is a good juicy infuriating story with a well-documented but extremely satisfying moral outcome one precipitated by an emotional tug-of-war between Altmann and Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) a young American lawyer. She convinces him to take the case. Increasingly moved by his own connection to the past (hes the grandson of the great Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg) he winds up having to convince her to keep fighting. Even as the movie flashes back to the Nazi era -- Mirren in the present cocks her head to one side or stares off somewhere and off we go -- its moving forward. This kind of parallel storytelling device and its transitions can be labored; directors and writers like the challenge of narrative double-dipping. But it works here because Altmanns family the Bloch-Bauers provides an opulent affluent contrast to encroaching Nazi barbarism. Tatiana Maslany plays young Maria who eventually has to go on the run looking for a way out of Vienna. Daniel Bruhl plays an Austrian journalist helping Maria and Randol with the legal case. Most of the other members of the cast -- Elizabeth McGovern Charles Dance and Jonathan Pryce (as William Rehnquist) -- have tiny parts that give the movie some PBS Masterpiece pedigree. (As Randols wife Katie Holmes does a lot of literal and figurative plate-cleaning and chest-nuzzling.) But the parts for Mirren and Reynolds are rich. The minute Altmann scolds Schoenberg for being late to their first meeting at her little home then offers him streusel you can sense a deep well of affection building between them. Putting these two alongside each other is an act of gumption. His height lends him an imposing quality that Mirren summons just in her carriage. But shes not going for ritziness just pushiness and the presumption of decorum. She brings out an actor in Reynolds -- hes patient watchful full of quick thought and mounting emotion. In the last year or so hes finally ripening as a performer. Who knew that all it took in order to see it was playing a Jewish lawyer? 2929 Productions Serena Directed by Susanne Bier You know how I was saying that with something like Woman in Gold you can tell within minutes that its going to work? Well there are movies for which the opposite is true where you know in the opening shots that youre about to spend the longest 109 minutes of your life. Biers movie begins with scenic images of treetops and landscapes and a place card that tells us were in the Great Smoky Mountains of 1929. Then theres a wide shot of Bradley Cooper standing on a porch at dawn (or is it dusk?) looking yonder. He plays a lumber baron named George Pemberton with what sounds like a mildly Boston accent (he doesnt get a proper full sentence for about 30 minutes). George fights environmentalists and is obsessed with capturing a panther rumored to be loose in the surrounding forest. In the meantime he gets Serena a wife who has come to the Carolinas from Colorado and who is played in what can only be called a coma by Jennifer Lawrence. ""Shes a pistol"" says George by which he must mean a tranquilizer gun. Their meeting on horseback is almost exactly the same as the one Cooper and Lawrence shared while jogging in Silver Linings Playbook except the garbage-bag poncho is replaced by garbage-bag moviemaking. Serenas competence (and jodhpurs) proceeds to set the men on edge especially Georges no. 2 (David Dencik) whose closet-case envy turns him hilariously untrustworthy. One character cant take his eyes off her and loses a hand. The movie tries to lose its mind in a rush of James M. Cain-style luridness. But its embarrassing the sex the accents (most of the locals are played by Europeans) the eagle training the conspiratorial glances the jealousy the prophecies the manslaughter. The dialogue requires Lawrence to drone things like ""Our love began the day we met. Nothing that happened before it even exists."" Id probably sleep my way through this role too. The film is bad enough that by the end of the week Serena could no longer be in movie theaters just on demand. The badness though is transfixing. Its rare to watch a movie made by a professional director -- albeit in Bier a maudlin overly rewarded Danish one -- with two major stars and some veteran actors (there are dumb parts for Rhys Ifans Kim Bodnia and Toby Jones) and have no idea what or why youre watching. Absolutely nothing works. No one seems to understand the place or the people. And the only thing gleaned from the lumber industry is that you can build an entire movie from performances made of wood. David Levinthal/Adopt Films Effie Gray Directed by Richard Laxton Now is a pretty good moment for modestly pitched adult-oriented movies. Theres Woman in Gold (a second cousin of 2013s Philomena); the very good Danny Collins; the not-that-exasperating Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; and Noah Baumbachs earnest messy mostly funny artistic-maturity satire While Were Young. This latest incarnation of Euphemia ""Effie"" Grays suffocating 19th-century marriage to the art critic John Ruskin (Greg Wise) would seem to be part of the club but its deadly dull clogged with all kinds of string and piano music and sunk by a perplexingly lifeless performance by Dakota Fanning as Gray. Its not all her fault but she seems hemmed by all the period and accent. This version of Gray is determined to be a good wife but is thwarted by both Ruskins haughty aristocratic parents (Julie Walters David Suchet) and his asexual interest in her. Theres a way to play disappointment and confusion but Fanning doesnt find it and Laxton doesnt appear to know how to help her. She makes a lot of long faces. Shes not playing the woman so much as the malaise implied by a name like Euphemia. It doesnt help that lively folks like Claudia Cardinale as a Venetian countess and Emma Thompson as the art critic and historian Elizabeth Eastlake arrive here and there to lay out the movies politics with both abandon and authority. Thompson wrote the script and is married to Wise. Casting herself as Grays guardian angel underscores the movies point-blank feminism while also giving it some desperately needed snap. There have been many retellings of this relationship. Some as this one does imagine it as a triangle of propriety between Gray Ruskin and the painter John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge). But its more of a slowgoing jailbreak narrative than a love story. The movie makes it clear from the start that it stands with Grays liberation. In the meantime youre left with a lot of dark rooms and foggy bogs. It is a film about art and artists with no visual imagination and emotional heat just heaps of repetitive right-thinking. Its as much a movie as it is a term paper. Magnolia Pictures White God Directed by Kornel Mundruczo It doesnt feel good not loving an oppression-and-revolution allegory -- mostly starring actual dogs -- that some other critics and filmgoers think is the cats meow. There is after all a real intelligence behind this movie. A Hungarian girl (Zsofia Psotta) is separated from her mixed-breed pet Hagen after her cheap cold-blooded conductor father (Sandor Zsoter) whom shes just moved in with refuses to pay a fine for the dog. Wandering the streets the homeless Hagen faces one humiliation after the next courtesy of other dogs and heartless human dognappers until enough is enough and sweet Hagen sours. The danger is meant to be pervasive enough to tempt you to bow down once the film reaches a moment of submissive divinity in its final scenes. But the allegory is something of a nonstarter Cruelty of every kind exists but what beyond that does Mundruczo whos 40 have to say? His previous movie Tender Son The Frankenstein Project a handsomer equally politically overburdened parable of suffering also got better the less like a parable and the more like an action-thriller it became. The movies best stuff involves streets flooded with dogs. Many of these dogs have a fascinating screen presence. The intimacy of their close-ups is something. Watching some of them makes you understand why Lassie and Benji were so popular Their sentience seems to explain the heretofore inexplicable. Here that sentience and the fascist critique to which its affixed just arent enough. The obviousness of the message -- follow the right leader -- would be more tolerable in a less badly acted less shoddy-looking film. Kino Lorber La Sapienza Directed by Eugene Green An acclaimed French architect (Fabrizio Rongione) and his education-theorist wife (Christelle Prot) head to Italy so he can research and write a book on the architect Francesco Borromini. The husband visits wondrous structures with a young architecture student (Ludovico Succio) while the wife sits with the young mans nervous ailing sister (Arianna Nastro). What actually follows involves the couple applying baroque-theater ideas to film interaction. They speak to each other while facing the camera turning face to face only once theyve recited their lines. The speaking that transpires among them is voluminous but it barely qualifies as conversation. These presentations of place and state of mind are presented self-seriously and snobbishly as a walking tour away from 21st-century modernity. I hate obnoxious public cell phone calls too but having the wife overhear one and give the camera a disdainfully blank look makes you roll your eyes. Green has been at this style of bone-dry theatrical moviemaking for most of this century. Hes an American-born French citizen and academic. What you do get here are new ways of seeing architectural space. Its a mystery why youd want to watch two actors not quite act when you can send a camera up toward the dome of majestic buildings. But you dont know what Green derives from working this way beyond an expression of cultural superiority. Hes asking us to open our minds as he appears to be thumbing his nose. This kind of formalism needs to do more than walk through classical wonders. It should want to create cinema that can stand near or beside them. This movie defensively consecrates whats already there. You dont need a film to do that.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Robert Viglasky) Robert Viglasky Katie Holmes (left) and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Robert Viglasky) Its a cautionary tale First the Nazis came for our neighbors. Then they came for us. Then they came for our paintings.The Weinstein Company keeps finding new angles from which to view the Holocaust and ""The Woman in Gold"" is a culturally lofty one. Its the true story of a postwar custody battle -- not for an orphaned girl but for a pilfered portrait of a lady.The painting by Gustav Klimt is known as ""Woman in Gold"" but to the art establishment in postwar Austria the painting in the Viennese museum is the nations ""Mona Lisa."" To Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) its a last link to her family.The woman in the world-famous painting is Marias late aunt Adele. At the California funeral of Marias sister (who is inexplicably shrugged off during the long flashbacks that follow) the aging Maria seeks legal advice about reacquiring the modernist masterpiece that had been seized 50 years earlier. Young lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds cast against type as a bespectacled bumbler) accepts the challenge partly because he himself is of Austrian heritage but mostly because it would mean a hefty commission. In the flashbacks beautiful Adele (Antje Traue) is like a surrogate mother to young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) whose father and uncle are wealthy Jewish art patrons sharing a lavish apartment. If you dont pay attention you might miss the fact that Adele dies a dozen years before Germany annexes Austria. And although the obligatory scenes depict the Nazis (and anti-Semitic locals) humiliating the Jewish shopkeepers leading to a race-against-the-clock escape for Maria and her beloved Fritz (Max Irons who likewise disappears from the film for the ensuing decades) ""Woman in Gold"" is essentially a 1990s courtroom drama. That means that on both sides of the Atlantic Teutonic bureaucrats are urging Maria to forgive and forget while the feisty old woman keeps talking about the principle of the thing. Meanwhile Randol risks his job and marriage (to Pam played by Katie Holmes) to file endless appeals.Despite a debatable focus and dubious moralizing --money plays a pivotal role in the final outcome -- ""The Woman in Gold"" works largely because of the odd-couple chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds. It just goes to show that broad strokes are appealing when theyre in the right frame.What ""The Woman in Gold""  Two and a half stars out of four  Run time 149  Rating PG-13  Content Some mature thematic elements and brief strong language  Where Plaza Frontenac Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Woman In Gold Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Joe Williams Gustave Klimt Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

AUDIE CORNISH HOST April is an awkward time for the movie industry. That lull when the Oscar buzz is gone and summer blockbuster season has yet to start. And our critic Bob Mondello says that makes it the perfect time for movies that might not get noticed during the busier times of the year. He points the two based-in-reality movies that opened this week - ""Woman In Gold"" and ""Effie Gray."" BOB MONDELLO In the opening shots of the ""Woman In Gold"" the gold which is to say real gold leaf is being cut and brushed and applied to a canvas. Gustav Klimt is painting a young Viennese woman in 1907. And as he gilds her portrait with tiny sheets of that most precious of metals the painting acquires a shimmering otherworldly air. It is a breathtaking work of modernist art and one that deserves an artful movie which is not quite what it gets in ""Woman In Gold"" a story about the decades-long battle for ownership of whats sometimes called the Austrian Mona Lisa. From Klimts studio the film flashes forward to 1990s California where Maria Altmann who fled Austria during World War II has begun working family connections to find a lawyer. When she does she shows him a photograph of the painting. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""WOMAN IN GOLD"") HELEN MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) Oh here she is. MONDELLO In an art history book. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""WOMAN IN GOLD"") MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) My Aunt Adele - she was taken off the walls of our home by the Nazis. And since then shes been hanging in the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna. RYAN REYNOLDS (As Randol Schoenberg) And now youd like to be reunited. MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) Wouldnt that be lovely? REYNOLDS (As Randol Schoenberg) Make you a rich woman Im sure. MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) You think thats what this is about. No I have to do what I can to keep these memories alive. MONDELLO Now if that sounds like a screenwriter setting out an agenda it is. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""WOMAN IN GOLD"") MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) Because people forget you see especially the young. MONDELLO An agenda for a film that wants to be educational part World War II refresher course part restitution law primer. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""WOMAN IN GOLD"") MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) And then of course theres justice. MONDELLO And biggest part - moral lesson. Director Simon Curtis is lucky to have Helen Mirren on hand since she can turn the films art history speeches into something that sounds like conversation. But the screenplay doesnt do either of them any favors - forever spelling out exactly whats at stake as it flashes back and forth between the young Maria escaping wartime Austria and Mirrens older Maria confronting Austrian bureaucrats who are as two-dimensional as the painting theyre determined to hang on to. Happily the star and her young lawyer played by Ryan Reynolds establish an odd couple routine that keeps things lively. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""WOMAN IN GOLD"") MIRREN (As Maria Altmann) You are quite rude youre a little uncouth and you are completely disinterested in the past. REYNOLDS (As Randol Schoenberg) And you have an unusual talent for making me feel good about myself. MONDELLO Which is useful when the plot gets bogged down in legalities and the ""Woman In Gold"" becomes less about art than about courtroom speeches about art. The courts have also figured in the story of ""Effie Gray"" though behind the scenes where a pair of lawsuits delayed the pictures release by more than a year. Effie played by Dakota Fanning was a Scottish youngster who considered herself wildly fortunate to be wooed and wed by influential art critic John Ruskin in 1848 until she got to the home he shared with his parents. Ruskins mom it turns out was a bit too devoted to her son. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""EFFIE GRAY"") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR (As character) Mrs. Ruskins just putting him into a bath. Shes been aching to get her hands on him. MONDELLO And then came the wedding night. Effie approached their marriage bed for the first time let her nightgown fall to the floor and watched as her new husbands eyes widened in horror - Victorian jitters perhaps. And thats where things stood for a good long time. Screenwriter and co-star Emma Thompson shows Effie doing her best to be a dutiful wife but after five years finally coming clean about whats going on. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""EFFIE GRAY"") EMMA THOMPSON (As Lady Eastlake) Let me understand you. You are telling me that you still to this day do not understand the details of the most intimate relation within marriage. You have not experienced them. DAKOTA FANNING (As Effie Gray) He has never so much as touched me. MONDELLO Thompson steers Effie to a doctor who examines her. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""EFFIE GRAY"") ROBBIE COLTRANE (As doctor) Im perfectly thunderstruck. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR (As character) He must be mad. MONDELLO Then a lawyer weighs in. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""EFFIE GRAY"") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR (As lawyer) Her madness unfortunately is not sufficient grounds for divorce. If it were half the marriages in London would be in jeopardy. MONDELLO And while youd think the arrival of a handsome young artist in the household to paint Ruskins portrait would move things along even hes trying to protect Effies virtue. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""EFFIE GRAY"") TOM STURRIDGE (As Everett Millais) John you cant leave her on her own with me. GREG WISE (As John Ruskin) Yes I realize its a bore Everett. STURRIDGE (As Everett Millais) No not at all. Im talking about the impropriety. WISE (As John Ruskin) Oh for heavens sake. STURRIDGE (As Everett Millais) John you seem to pay no mind to the safety of your wifes reputation to leave her entirely alone with another man single man. MONDELLO Yet thats what he does and nature does finally take its course - happily for Effie and happily for our audiences at the attractively shot appealingly acted and decorously eye-opening biopic ""Effie Gray.""

Randol Schoenberg Maria Altmann Starring Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Tatiana Maslany What might the real woman in gold have made of Woman in Gold?More than a century ago Adele Bloch-Bauer was a rebel a socialist socialite who with her industrialist husband hosted a popular salon that championed Viennas avant-garde. Gustav Klimt painted her portrait twice and likely bedded her even more. Decades later the portraits looted by the Nazis became the centre of a landmark art-restitution case - and now of a Hollywood film based on the case. In Woman in Gold Helen Mirren plays Adeles flinty frisky niece Maria Altmann who teams with the callow and hungry lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to become an ""odd couple"" David against the Goliath of the Austrian government.Beset by portentous dialogue and a clockwork screenplay Mirren and Reynolds (and Canadas Tatiana Maslany who radiates in her scenes as the newlywed Maria) breathe what life they can into their cardboard roles. Director Simon Curtis milks the predictable drama thrills and heartache of the Holocaust-era story but its a paint-by-numbers triumph a copy of something weve seen many times before.

But this is nevertheless the sort of film where younger folk wink and nod at one another to show they appreciate how much spunk the old bag of bones in the back seat is exhibiting. It has the sheen of serious drama but remains a not-so-distant cousin of that benchmark of the genre ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot.""Based on true events Mirren plays Maria Altman a Jewish refugee from Austria who fled from the Nazis long ago. The film opens with the burial of her sister an event that has Maria looking back at their shared past. They came from a wealthy arts-loving family and all the paintings from the familys lavish apartment were confiscated by the Nazis.Now those paintings notably a gold-encrusted one of Marias aunt are hanging in a museum in Vienna. Maria wonders if she might be able to get them back (theyre worth hundreds of millions). So she enlists the aid of a young struggling lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) -- grandson of the famed Austrian composer son of a famous judge -- to help her investigate.Together they fly to Vienna and begin looking into the past with the help of an investigative reporter (Daniel Bruhl). And it turns out the paintings do seem to legally belong to Maria. Now all they have to do is convince Austria of that.Austria it turns out is not easily convinced. And so your basic David vs. Goliath confrontation begins.Meanwhile director Simon Curtis is laying out the life of young Maria (""Orphan Black"" star Tatiana Maslany henceforward the go-to gal for young Helen Mirren roles) in flashbacks. The cultured life the Nazi invasion the destruction of families Marias flight to freedom with her young husband (Max Irons). Its inevitably moving but its also inevitably familiar.The chief weakness here is the script by Alexi Kaye Campbell which tends toward earnestness and depends on sudden moments of revelation (Schoenberg visits a Holocaust memorial and suddenly remembers hes Jewish; the investigative reporter blurts out that his father was a Nazi.)Still you cant go all that wrong with a feisty old lady trying to punch the ghost of Nazis past in the nose. ""Woman in Gold"" may be a bit obvious but its still a story worth telling. The moral is clear Dont mess with old bags of bones. They just might bite.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongWoman in GoldGRADE C+Rated PG-13 for some thematic elements and brief strong languageRunning time 109 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1bPaCvT MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2015/03/31/tom-long-helen-mirren-fights-art-stolen-nazis-woman/70745822/,200,womaningold4,womaningold,detroitnews

(Robert Viglasky) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 2 2015 445 PM Title WOMAN IN GOLD Film Info With Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds An Austrian immigrant seeks the rights to a precious painting. Director Simon Curtis (144). PG-13 Language. Area theaters. By Joe Neumaier Movie Critic Woman in Gold -- 2 stars IF YOUVE ever wanted to see Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds team up the civilized but sadly seriously dull based-on-fact film ""Woman in Gold"" is your chance. In 1998 an elderly Los Angeles shopkeeper Maria Altman (Mirren) drafts a friends lawyer son Randol Schoenberg (Reynolds) to put the belongings of Altmans late sister in order. Among the property is a will from a woman named Adele Bloch-Bauer. She was the Altman sisters aunt an elegant beautiful woman who died in 1925 -- and who modeled for the artist Gustav Klimt most famously for a painting known unofficially as ""Woman in Gold."" That painting like many precious objects was stolen from Altmans childhood home by the Nazis. Fifty years later as Austria aims to return some pilfered artwork to Holocaust survivors and their families Altman and Schoenburg lose a legal bid to get the painting back as Altmans detested homeland refuses to give up painting which has come to be known as ""The Mona Lisa of Austria"" worth 100 million. The struggle goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The idea that great pieces of art have amazing stories behind them is compelling. The script adds another layer of historical resonance as Schoenberg -- grandson of classical composer and Nazi refugee Arnold Schoenberg -- hears his grandfathers music with a renewed sense of identity. His Judaism like Altmans identity as an Austrian was an afterthought to him until the fight for the Klimt painting put it in a new light. Yet ""Woman in Gold"" is missing broad dramatic strokes. Director Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn"") keeps the story noble and truthful but it gets sluggish. An Austrian reporter (Daniel Bruhl) aids Altman and Schoenberg and conveys shame for his countrys behavior but his primary role is to annotate facts the film itself should bring home. Mirren as always is a chameleon with a way of letting vulnerability creep into the corners of stern reserve. Even when the ladies she plays are tightly wound (""The Last Station"" ""Hitchcock"" ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"") theres a sauciness bubbling up. But Altmans emotional pivots are built on events shown in flashback during the darkest days of World War II so their resonance is felt but not shown. As for Reynolds hes out of his depth with a character who has to undergo epiphanies. Hes best playing glib charmers and even then his surface smarminess has to be tamped down for him to be palatable. Next to Mirren hes like a dope in a museum trying to be respectful of the genius around him but unable to sit still.

Robert Viglasky/Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Robert Viglasky/Weinstein Company Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds star in Woman in Gold. Robert Viglasky/Weinstein Company Gustav Klimts famous painting of a dark-eyed beauty encased in shimmering gold lozenges is often dismissed by art critics as a disappointing excursion into kitsch by the avant-garde Austrian painter. But the portrait commissioned by a wealthy Jewish family not long before the outbreak of World War II has brought visceral pleasure to countless owners of postcards posters and key-rings who have yet to set foot in New Yorks Neue Galerie where the original hangs today. How it got there from Vienna makes for a sensational true-life tale however staidly told in the new film Woman in Gold. To Maria Altmann an elderly Los Angeles Jewish dress-shop owner played in the movie by Helen Mirren Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer was a precious reminder of her glamorous and beloved Aunt Adele lost forever in the wake of Nazi art theft. Before her premature death Bloch-Bauer had bequeathed the painting to Viennas prestigious Belvedere art gallery. Soon after the painting along with many other artifacts owned by her family was brazenly looted by Austrian Nazis; Maria was one of the few in her family who escaped death and ended up in the Untied States. After the War the painting resurfaced and remained in Viennas prestigious Belvedere gallery for six decades until Altmann -- with the help of a young attorney who happened to be the grandson of emigre composer Arnold Schoenberg a contemporary of Klimt -- returned to try to reclaim her family property. The epic legal fight that followed is the subject of Woman in Gold a stolidly sequential drama by British director Simon Curtis (My Week With Marilyn). With a directing style best described as reverently ceremonial Curtis plods through scenic tours of the baroque architectural grandeur of Vienna today regularly punctuated with flashbacks to the traumatic wrecking of Marias gilded youth. Dancing the hora at Marias wedding comes with a thudding overlay of Nazi jackboots. On the soundtrack lest you miss the message is ""O Mary dont you weep."" With star power more in mind than goodness of fit the movie is hopelessly miscast. Mirren is her usual entertaining blast of acerbic brio but here she improbably reprises her QEII testiness accessorized with an Austrian accent. For his part Ryan Reynolds a terrific physical comedian is all wrong for the earnestly idealistic Randy Schoenberg who found a novel way to help Maria sue the Austrian government for recovery of a painting it had now recast as a symbol of the countrys national identity. How they accomplished this is such a great yarn that for all its broad brush strokes Woman in Gold cant help but tell a moving populist parable about the will to power of an ordinary woman -- one among millions it turns out as the restitution of wartime cultural theft becomes a very big deal in the art world -- taking on powerful institutions to regain a tiny fraction of her familys appalling losses. To the credit of screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell and a nice turn by Daniel Bruhl as an Austrian investigative journalist with a guilty secret he is driven to expunge Woman in Gold does not shy away from Austrias reluctance to face up to its wartime record. Instead the film suggests that the affirmation of national pride that moved Austrian officials to fight Marias claim tooth and nail depended on a sustained denial of its own shameful history. After a Herculean struggle in the end an Austrian arbitration committee did right by Altmann who sold Klimts Adele to cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder for a fortune and donated most of the proceeds to arts institutions and Holocaust survivors groups. There it hangs in New York a refugee like its rightful owner -- and an enduring testament to the Austrian back-story that never made it into The Sound of Music.

Comments click to enlarge Woman in Gold Video Rated PG-13  111 minutes  2015 The Nazis illegal seizure of hundreds of thousands of artworks--the subject of the fine 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa--becomes the pretext for heavy-handed sentimentality in this British-American docudrama. Helen Mirren plays Maria Altmann a wealthy Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis settled in Los Angeles and in the late 1990s successfully sued the Austrian government to reclaim several valuable Gustav Klimt paintings that had been seized from her family; a woefully miscast Ryan Reynolds plays the nice Jewish lawyer who agrees to represent her. The characterizations are patronizingly simple--the Austrian officials who fight Mirren in court might as well be bullies in a high school sports drama--and the ridiculously genteel depictions of the Nazis persecution of Jews play like Mel Brooks without the jokes.

As per the title Helen Mirren predictably shines in the role. She fairly inhabits the role of Maria Altmann a woman of breeding whose wedding brooch ended up on the neck of Hermann Goerings wife and whose family art collection (including Gustav Klimts famed painting Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I) was declared a national treasure by an Austrian government that refused to give it up. Mobile users click this link As a movie however Woman in Gold is an object lesson in the fact that there are actors and there are actors. Everyone else in the movie - except for Ryan Reynolds who plays Altmanns lawyer Randol Schoenberg - gets only as much time as necessary to move the plot along. And this is a talented list including Daniel Bruhl (Rush The Fifth Estate) Jonathan Pryce Katie Holmes and every genre fans dreamgirl Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany as the young Maria. As for Reynolds he has the opposite problem. He has equal time with Dame Helen Mirren and dramatically bounces between straight-man and passenger. Hes an amiable actor but has yet to prove he can nail a superhero role. In Woman in Gold Reynolds has one truly demanding dramatic scene. As Schoenberg (the grandson of the great Austrian composer) he only appreciates Altmanns case as a possible record-setting award and career-making legal challenge. But his commitment turns to obsession at a Holocaust memorial where the emotional dam finally bursts. Reynolds does not yet have catharsis convincingly down. Bruhl as mentioned doesnt have enough to do as a crusading Austrian journalist out to make his country face its past. And Maslany certainly looks the part of a beautiful young 1930s socialite in Marias flashbacks one who ultimately makes a hairsbreadth escape from the Nazis leaving her family to their fate (and given that she plays umpteen parts on Orphan Black we are waiting for her to chew some scenery in some other film soon). As for Holmes who plays Schoenbergs wife the descriptor ""initially dubious but ultimately supportive spouse"" takes almost as long to say as it does to perform. The flashbacks indeed may be the problem. There is too much storytelling in a story that should be more about the present. (And how much film time is needed to convince the viewer the Nazis were monsters?) All that said Mirren is the single reason to watch the movie. In her eyes the 80-something Altmann is everything the flashbacks try to convey. She is teasing manipulative haughty afraid and stubborn. The real Maria Altmann stood and demanded her rights to a government in denial (and to a U.S. government that wanted no part of her crusade lest it affect foreign policy). She was a David facing two Goliaths with legal counsel. And Mirren is a worthy conduit for that kind of unique character - one only reality could write.

PGBased on a true story about a fight for justice wrapped in passion memory and determination and told using the considerable talents of Helen Mirren Woman in Gold should be a much better movie.Who wouldnt get caught up in this real-life drama especially with Mirrens deliberately crafted portrayal of Jewish Austrian Holocaust refugee Maria Altmann and her lengthy and often emotionally shattering court battle to reclaim paintings looted from her family home by the Nazis?Article Continued BelowOne painting in particular Gustav Klimts gilded art nouveau portrait of Altmanns beloved and beautiful aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer (played in flashback scenes by Antje Traue).Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds lack chemistry in Woman in Gold based on a true story about a womans lengthy battle to reclaim her familys Nazi-looted art.  (Robert Viglasky)  Instead screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell appears determined to just get to each key point in the story and move on while director Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) hews to his more familiar TV background as Women in Gold moves one deliberate step at a time to its conclusion while an attempt to insert some true emotion turns awkwardly overwrought.Mirren plays the widowed Altmann as emotionally cautious and strong-willed yet with a dry wit that because it emerges occasionally is worth waiting to hear.She tends the garden outside her tidy California bungalow in a neatly ironed shirt living with repressed memories of having barely escaped Austria during the Nazi occupation with a vow she would never go back.With the death of her sister Altmann discovers evidence she still has a claim on looted paintings deemed a pre-war bequest by her aunt to Viennas Belvedere Gallery. Among the treasures was ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" then renamed ""Woman in Gold"" to obscure the heritage of its Jewish subject. Altmann presses struggling young lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds not quite convincing) to help her fight back. Hes reluctant -- and not just about taking the case in an area of law where he has no experience.Unfortunately Mirren and Reynolds dont really click never engaging in dialogue as much as explaining to us how theyre moving the picture along. Thats especially true when it comes to legal complexities challenging to convey of course but still far too wooden.Enter Daniel Bruhl the Viennese reporter who introduces himself as ""investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin"" and then never writes a word about the battle to help return the painting known as the ""Austrian Mona Lisa"" to its rightful owner.Altmanns back story is told using flashbacks with Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany handling herself admirably (and in German) as the young Maria Bloch-Bauer who lived in an artistic and scholarly home before her Jewish family was targeted by Nazis. Austrian sympathizers seen furiously filling Viennas streets to target Jews further spur the newlywed Maria and her husband Fritz Altmann (Max Irons) to craft a dramatic and risky escape.Mirren compellingly conveys Altmanns struggles to suppress what she endured in fleeing Vienna steeling herself to return to Austria decades later to deal with a government that will fight with everything it has to keep the signature artwork and national treasure in the country. These are the most genuine moments in Woman in Gold standing out amid others that cant get past artificiality. That goes double for Katie Holmes who shows up occasionally as Schoenbergs wife getting little more than a cartoonish scene playing the calm pregnant woman going into labour while her husband panics.As for Mirren she is never less that perfect her accent as crisp as her demeanour emotions held in check until the last including touching flashback scenes that bring Altmanns ordeal into sharp focus reminding what was left behind and why she was so determined to have an adored piece of her past back.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The Weinstein Company gives Woman in Gold a prestige-picture veneer and its based on the compelling true story of Maria Altmann a WWII refugee who fought to win back the titular Gustav Klimt portrait decades after Nazis ransacked her familys Vienna home. Mirren is formidable as Altmann now a flinty Los Angeles matron (Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany plays her in soft-focus flashbacks). But Ryan Reynolds as the rookie lawyer who helps her make the case is miscast in a role as dull as his deglamorized teeth and the script doesnt seem to trust that well find a meaningful moment without having our noses rubbed in it. Gold aims to be a Philomena-style story of intergenerational friendship and triumph over tragedy; instead it ends up nickel-plating a narrative that already shone on its own.

Close Join the conversation... With GuideLive Contributor Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Quite often the phrase ""remarkable true story"" unfolds as a curse not a blessing when its Hollywoods turn to offer its rendition. As is usually the case with such stories a well-received book has already been published so now the movie has the daunting task of at least returning serve let alone trying to one-up its predecessor in print.Such is the case with Woman in Gold for which better is not the result to put it mildly. The book that preceded the film The Lady in Gold The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimts Masterpiece Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is a mesmerizing read brimming with rich detail that critics all over the world have anointed with we-really-really-like-it reviews. (Disclosure Its author Anne-Marie OConnor is a friend and former colleague of mine.)The film is not based on OConnors book though both deal with the same ""remarkable true story."" Sixty years after she and her husband fled Vienna Maria Altmann (played by Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren) seeks to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Those possessions include a jewel valued far more highly than any other plundered artifact Klimts portrait of Altmanns aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer. Its a stunning work of art and one deeply prized by the Austrians who in the movie appear almost Nazilike in their craven zeal to cling to the portrait that hangs proudly in a Viennese museum. This photo provided by The Weinstein Company shows Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" Robert Viglasky/AP Altmann hires an eager but inexperienced lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) and together at times tussling with one another to the point of sabotaging their alliance they wage a battle fought on the artistic front lines of Vienna and even in the U.S. Supreme Court whose favorable ruling accelerates their claims against the Austrians.Heres the problem While the story is truly one of a kind the film often feels like a TV movie of the week even one of those treacly Hallmark productions. Mirren is well-suited to the inspirational role of Altmann but Reynolds terrific in such romantic comedies as Definitely Maybe seems oddly miscast.The film relies heavily on flashback as a narrative tool. Some of the time its cinematic journeys back in time work well but at other points not at all. The movie does maintain your interest because the story is quite unlike any youve ever heard before but to use a clichA(c) that sadly fits this as well as any Read the book.By Michael Granberry.

Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Woman in Gold starring Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Daniel Bruhl Katie Holmes Tatiana Maslany Max Irons Charles Dance Elizabeth McGovern and Jonathan Pryce. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Thats quite a painting"" someone says in ""Woman in Gold"" on first glimpsing Gustav Klimts celebrated ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" and anyone seeing the artwork in person during its brief visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art or at its current home at New Yorks Neue Galerie would have to agree.The saga of how this dazzling work sometimes known as ""the Mona Lisa of Austria"" came to leave the walls of Viennas august Belvedere Gallery to take up permanent residence in the United States is quite a story as well. And as the fact that three documentaries touch on its narrative makes clear any tale involving art history Nazi thievery conflicting wills and complex international legal wrangles is certainly worthy of cinematic treatment.With all these good things going for it its regrettable that ""Woman in Gold"" is no more than adequate more old-fashioned Hollywoodization than incisive modern dramatization. But the film does have an asset that cant be ignored and thats Helen Mirrens tip-top performance as the films costar. Its not enough to save the picture but it certainly makes a difference. Mirren stars as Maria Altmann Adele Bloch-Bauers niece an imperious Los Angeles matron we first meet in 1998 burying her only sister in a local cemetery. After the service Maria reconnects with an old friend and fellow Austrian emigre Barbara Schoenberg (Frances Fisher) the daughter-in-law of the great composer Arnold Schoenberg. Woman in Gold Robert Viglasky / The Weinstein Company Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" (Robert Viglasky / The Weinstein Company) It turns out that Maria is in need of a lawyer she can trust and Barbaras son Randol a.k.a. Randy the composers grandson is a struggling local lawyer in desperate need of a significant case. It sounds like a match made in heaven except that for quite some time its anything but.One of the things that makes this a story of interest is that even though its ending was a glorious one not only was its outcome uncertain for years but also its two main participants were not always eager to collaborate.For one thing Maria interested in the return of five Klimt paintings including the ""Adele"" portrait that the Nazis seized from her family is looking for an expert in art restitution an area Randy (a game but overmatched Ryan Reynolds) knows nothing about.

What do you do after you painstakingly re-create one of the most famous paintings on Earth? Hide it from sight of course. This likely will be the fate of a reproduction of Gustav Klimts 1907 masterpiece ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" painted by a scenic artist for the film opening Wednesday... (Jessica Gelt) Randy for his part is just starting a new job (Charles Dance is his no-nonsense boss) and a family (Katie Holmes is the standard-issue mostly understanding wife) and has no time for a wild goose chase especially in the company of a woman whose manner he clearly finds off-putting.Audiences however will likely feel otherwise about Maria Altmann. Though this kind of bossy performance can be viewed as falling off a log for Mirren the actress expertly creates Marias Mittel-European hauteur and leavens it with enough humanity to give the film an integrity it definitely needs.Not that director Simon Curtis and screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell dont try hard (maybe too hard) for significance and heft. There are several German-language flashbacks to the familys time in Vienna most effectively to the days when Maria was a child (Tatiana Maslany) and the favorite niece of her aunt Adele (Antje Traue.)Once the Nazis come to power in Austria however the scenes of storm-trooper depredation cant avoid a standard-issue feeling and remind us that Curtis earlier ""My Week With Marilyn"" felt similarly pro forma despite another strong lead performance in this case from Oscar-nominated Michelle Williams.Back in the present Randy finally gets interested in the case initially because he spies a potential payday. Despite the general feeling that paintings that get to be refrigerator magnets do not often leave their home countries he persuades Maria to come back to Vienna with him and pursue the case.Things get increasingly complex legally from here on in with everything from an appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist (Jonathan Pryce) to discussions of the relevance of the little-known Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act figuring in the mix.Even without including speculation about a possible Klimt/Adele relationship or acknowledging the controversy around how Adele and family eventually disposed of the paintings there is enough incident here to support a film.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 31 2015 The true story of Maria Altmann an Austrian woman who fled the Holocaust and many years later sued the Austrian government for the return of family-owned artworks that had been looted by the Nazis is a great one. Its also one that has been movingly told before on film in such documentaries as ""The Rape of Europa"" (2006). Newly dramatized with Helen Mirren in the starring role it unfortunately has lost a bit of its power. [The splendor of Helen Mirren] ""Woman in Gold"" takes its title from the informal name of a 1907 portrait of Marias aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer by the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. Stirring at times soggy and overly sentimental at others the film moves surprisingly slowly even though its action which takes place over many years of legal maneuvering has been condensed for narrative expediency. ""Woman in Gold"" really tells two stories. The first takes place in the recent past and covers Marias pursuit of restitution from her home in Los Angeles using the services of a young untested American lawyer played by Ryan Reynolds in full nerd mode. The second is told in flashback showing us Marias childhood and early life in Vienna from which she escaped after the annexation of Austria by the Germans. One of the films small pleasures is the sometimes contentious relationship between Randy Reynoldss earnest whippersnapper of an attorney and his somewhat starchy senior-citizen client. It adds a bit of crackle to the film. The contemporary part of the story sorely needs it. Although Maria jokes to Randy at one point -- as theyre dashing off to look for documents in some dusty archive -- that ""this is like a James Bond film"" it clearly isnt. The legal story line is sluggish and talky alternating between scenes of Randy staring intently at a computer screen and passionate conversations between him Maria and Austrian investigative reporter Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Bruhl) who assists in their case. Randy -- the great-grandson of Holocaust victims -- is given one scene in which Reynolds is called upon to emote deeply but the actor is not up to the task. The back story however which features several non-American actors and mostly German dialogue is far more gripping as Maria narrowly escapes with her new husband (Max Irons) in 1938. The young Maria is played by Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany with real soul. At several times the screenplay (by playwright Alexi Kaye Campbell) draws connections between what is going on in the past and whats going on in the present featuring dialogue meant to suggest that characters from Austrias past are speaking -- metaphorically -- to those in modern-day L.A. ""Your only enemy is fear"" Adele (Antje Traue) tells her young niece Maria (Nellie Schilling) but shes really speaking to the adult version of that little girl who has to overcome her aversion to returning to Austria if she wants her paintings. Its easy to guess how this story ends  even if you havent read up on the case which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Thats because of the heavy-handedness of the film which includes clumsily villainous caricatures of Austrian cultural officials. It gets you where you need to go but by pushing instead of gently leading you there. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains anti-Semitism and brief crude language.

"Woman in Gold review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Woman in Gold Woman in Gold Robert Viglasky /Weinstein Company Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold."" (Robert Viglasky /Weinstein Company) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Helen Mirren stars in a disappointing fact-based account of a Klimt and its fortune In ""Woman in Gold"" a paint-by-numbers account of a gorgeous Klimt and its tortured history of ownership theres really no other word for what Helen Mirren is doing in certain reaction shots out of subtle interpretive desperation mugging. Shes mugging. She is a sublimely talented performer and this is material with fascinating implications and I doubt theres a moviegoer in the world who doesnt like Helen Mirren. But even the best actors need a director to tell them to tone it down.Even so Mirrens the best reason to see this disappointingly shallow chronicle of the woman who waged a lengthy legal battle to regain rightful ownership of Gustav Klimts ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" along with other Klimt paintings. Mirren plays Maria Altmann the Jewish World War II exile who arrived in America in 1945 with her husband. Altmanns aunt was the Adele immortalized in the gold-flecked 1907 wonder. Seized by the Nazis along with the wealthy Altmann familys other effects the painting ended up in Viennas Belvedere Palace gallery on display after the war according to the portrait subjects wishes.But was the Klimt really the subjects to bequeath? Decades later spurred by the discovery that relatives unsuccessfully sought to reclaim ownership of the paintings Maria took up the charge seeking a fair restitution hearing in Austria. Her partner in this expensive legal long shot was Randy Schoenberg a fledgling Los Angeles attorney played by a wan Ryan Reynolds. Rebuffed by Belvedere officials who contended they came by the Klimts honestly and who seem roughly as sympathetic as the Third Reich Altmann and Schoenberg countered by pursuing the case in the U.S. judicial system all the way to the Supreme Court. You dont have to know the storys 2006 outcome ultimately settled in Austrian arbitration to get that foregone-conclusion feeling from watching director Simon Curtis film. First-time feature film screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell is concerned foremost with narrative clarity. But too often intriguing matters of provenance and legal maneuvering are ground into simplistic expository nuggets bread-crumbing the audience through the woods. The relationship between Altmann and Schoenberg sometimes testy but always loving plays out like two actors acting rather than two actors inhabiting a real situation. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. And was Reynolds really the guy to play this guy? In repose or in conversation the actor struggles to convey much of anything as Schoenberg (who is composer Arnold Schoenbergs grandson). Katie Holmes as Schoenbergs wife has little to work with; the same goes for Daniel Bruhl as the investigative reporter whose research helped pave the way for the paintings outcome. Other familiar performers come and go among them Jonathan Pryce (briefly seen as U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist) and Charles Dance (as Schoenbergs gruff employer). The film includes a string of flashbacks detailing the Anschluss of 1938 and the Altmann family members various fates. As depicted in ""Woman in Gold"" none of this is particularly difficult to watch. And for any movie whose story lives in the shadow of the Holocaust a tasteful remove is rarely a sign of dramatic truth.""Woman in Gold"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some thematic elements and brief strong language) Running time 150Opens Wednesday at Landmarks Century Centre Cinema opens wide Friday.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Reviews Scenic artist hit a masterwork mother lode with Woman in Gold Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-woman-in-gold-review-20150331-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,womaningold15,womaningold,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For decades art lovers in Vienna knew her only as the Lady In Gold a nameless raven-haired beauty immortalized through oil. But to Gustav Klimt creator of this ""Mona Lisa Of Austria"" she was Adele Bloch-Bauer a Jewish socialite whose likeness the artist twice committed to canvas. Woman In Gold about the real-life battle for a disputed national treasure argues that hanging Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I under a generic new name--as The Belvedere did years after Nazis stole it from Bloch-Bauers family--was emblematic of how Austria tried to paper over its involvement in Hitlers reign of terror. Thats a credible thesis. Its also pretty rich coming from a film that performs its own historical makeover. An early contender for the most Weinstein movie of the year Woman In Gold bends a complicated legal quagmire--heavy on questions of ownership and national responsibility--into a crowd-pleasing David and Goliath story. The title too generic for Klimts masterpiece suits the movie just fine.Swapping her native British accent for an impeccable Austrian one Helen Mirren brings a zesty eccentricity to the role of Maria Altmann grown niece of the lady in gold. In 1998 a half-century after she fled her homeland for the sanctuary of the States the widowed Maria begins quietly investigating ways to reclaim the pilfered paintings including the famous rendering of her late aunt. For legal counsel she looks to Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) whose grandfather the revered Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg was a friend of the family. Randy doesnt know much about art nor does he have the full support of either his new boss (Charles Dance doing another stern variation on Tywin Lannister) or his spouse (Katie Holmes in a housewife role as thankless as the one she played for Tom Cruise). Nevertheless the attorneys interest is piqued especially when he sees the price tag on that iconic artwork.What follows is a kind of biographical buddy picture entwining the fates of two easy-to-root-for characters the driven survivor forced to finally confront her traumatic past and the crusading lawyer putting everything on the line for a case he believes in. Despite vowing never again to set foot on Austrian soil Maria begrudgingly accompanies Randy to Vienna where the two enlist the assistance of a muckraking reporter (Daniel Bruhl) in building a case against the Austrian government whose officials are roundly depicted as a bunch of sour bureaucrats who talk of reparations but do everything in their power to prevent them. Alexi Kaye Campbell the playwright who penned the script does an admirable job of summarizing the complex legal maneuvering this odd couple engaged in. But he also manages to make real people look and sound like bantering archetypes. Randy especially could have walked out a John Grisham novel. (It doesnt help that the green lawyer is played by Reynolds poorly concealing his movie-star swagger behind a pair of just-passed-the-bar spectacles.)In part perhaps to pad out the narrative Woman In Gold also cuts away from its present-tense plotline for flashbacks to Marias youth featuring Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany as the heroines younger self attempting to secure safe passage out of occupied Austria. Theres a certain integrity to actually shooting these scenes in subtitled German and the spectacle of shopkeepers forced to scrawl their ethnicity on the doors of their businesses will never lose its horrible historical resonance even when staged with tasteful anonymity by My Week With Marilyn director Simon Curtis. (He makes one long for the relative verve of John Madden.)By its second half Woman In Gold has devolved into a series of time-passing montages and courtroom showdowns (including one that casts Jonathan Pryce in an amusing cameo as a Supreme Court justice). Mirren who could play this part in her sleep manages to keep the poignancy of her characters plight simmering below the surface of most scenes. For Maria the point of the whole fight isnt money (though the Klimts would net her a pretty penny) but accountability To wrestle the paintings from Austria would be to force the government to acknowledge complicity and to really commit to efforts to make things right. At one point the expatriate seems to admit that any victory would be a bittersweet one as theres no way to truly repair the damage the Nazis (and those that welcomed them with open arms) did to her life her family and the nation she once called home. On the whole however such ambivalence doesnt fit Woman In Gold a legal drama that aims for a much less prickly brand of cathartic comeuppance--the middlebrow equivalent of an ""oh snap"" Share Tweet Filed Under Film Ryan Reynolds Helen Mirren Woman In Gold Simon Curtis More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Scientology doc Going Clear eviscerates the faithful famous and greedy Next Movie Review Lambert amp; Stamp is a glossy spotty piece of rock history Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

"Woman in Gold | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; woman-in-gold ) Woman in Gold (United States/United Kingdom 2015) April 01 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hollywood loves stories about crusading lawyers. For as long as there have been movies there have been courtroom dramas and although attorneys may be regarded with skepticism in the real world they are more often than not heroic on-screen. Although Woman in Gold has a larger agenda than merely lionizing another lawyer the skeleton of the movie is formed by the transformation of Ryan Reynolds Randol Schoenberg from a low-profile worker bee into the man at the center of an international controversy. Woman in Gold bears the ""based on a true story"" moniker and as is almost always the case that means certain elements of the narrative have been scripted to improve the cinematic experience. Essentially however this is an accurate account of what happened. The story begins in the late 1990s and follows the efforts of Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) an octogenarian Jew to retrieve paintings stolen from her family when the Nazis occupied Austria in the 1930s. To help in her dealings with the Austrian government which is highly resistant to giving up several Klimpt paintings they believe to be rightfully theirs Maria hires the inexperienced Randol. Despite initially being a reluctant participant in the drama Randol becomes dedicated to the cause and when his early attempts to restore the paintings to Maria are rebuffed he sues the Austrian government in U.S. court and litigates the case all the way to the Supreme Court (where it was heard in 2004). Woman in Gold is arguably of more interest for its historical perspective than for its drama. Although there is some suspense in the courtroom proceedings no one would mistake this for the next To Kill a Mockingbird or The Verdict. Additionally while an attempt is made to fashion a (platonic) relationship between Maria and Randol the result is superficial. The insight the film brings to the tenacity with which Austria fought against returning stolen property to Jewish exiles (or the heirs) is telling. The further in time we come from the Holocaust the easier it is to forget (or deny). A central theme in Woman in Gold is that the passage of time doesnt wash away the sins of the past. The crimes of the Nazis do not have a statute of limitations. Current possession of stolen items does not mean they shouldnt be returned to the owners from whom they were taken. Director Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) jockeys back and forth across the years frequently flashing back to the 1930s when Maria (played in this era by Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany) and her family fall under the Nazi shadow. The story of how Maria and her husband escaped from Austria (and were forced to leave behind loved ones to their certain doom) while being pursued by German officers plays out in parallel with the modern-day narrative of Marias return to the country of her birth. The 1930s segments are more compelling than those that transpire around the turn of the century but thats the nature of telling a tale set in such a volatile time. As befits an actress of her stature and capabilities Helen Mirren is given top billing. She brings a sense of long-suffering dignity to Maria but in truth hers is a supporting role. This is Ryan Reynolds movie. Although Reynolds is often associated with lightweight films he has shown himself to be an effective actor and his performance here exhibits the right mixture of earnestness and likability. He breathes life into the somewhat predictable arc traversed by Randols character. Woman in Gold like most courtroom dramas is invested with a crowd-pleasing element. The films demographic is probably limited to older art-house audiences - it has little to offer multiplex crowds seeking outrageous action and more outrageous comedy. Like most dramas it seeks to connect with its audience and providing they are open to the story its telling it works both as a reminder of past wrongs and an assurance that justice sometimes triumphs.

Woman in Gold is an extraordinary true story turned into an exemplary motion picture about one brave German Jew who bites the bullet and fights overwhelming odds to cut through the red tape in the Austrian government and reclaim the art treasures stolen from her family 60 years earlier by the Nazis. Its a touching film that entertains with warmth and humor while teaching us something about history law and justice with enormous heart subtlety and compassion brilliantly acted and skillfully written. Is there anything Helen Mirren cannot do? WOMAN IN GOLD 1/2 (3.5/4 stars) Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell Directed by Simon Curtis Starring Helen MIrren Ryan Reynolds and Daniel Bruhl Running time 109 min. Whatever else you feel about her theres no doubting her versatility. Simultaneously shes on Broadway playing the Queen of England in the smash hit play The Audience and now on the big screen as Jewish Holocaust survivor Maria Altmann. Dont debate which one to see first. Just make sure you see them both. Woman in Gold impeccably directed by Simon Curtis begins in Los Angeles in 1998. Mrs. Altmann the widowed proprietor of a small dress shop was lucky enough to escape to America in the nick of time; hoping the rest of her family would follow. It was not to be. They all died unspeakable deaths at the hands of Hitler after the Reich confiscated her affluent familys possessions including their elegant apartment in Vienna and a lifelong collection of valuable paintings especially five Gustav Klimts that hang in Viennas renowned cultural pantheon the Belvedere Gallery museum including the world-famous Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer that Klimt painted of her favorite aunt valued at 10 million and now called simply Woman in Gold. When her last surviving sister dies she finds letters linked to the Nazi theft and hires a young lawyer to seek art restitution (a recurring legal tangle that currently involves millions of claims and a subject investigated impressively in the George Clooney film The Monuments Men). The initial personality clash between the elderly strong-willed woman and the clean-cut but inexperienced preppie lawyer Randy Schoenberg (an awesomely adept and relentlessly convincing Ryan Reynolds in a performance that will amaze you) with a wife and family whose grandfather was Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg gradually eases once Randy begins his research revealing a real-life story of greed and terror more suspenseful than any fiction. Cutting from Mrs. Altmanns predicament exacerbated by unyielding opposition from the Austrian government to scenes that unfolded during the Nazi occupation of Vienna the film brings vibrantly to life a heritage worth defending and a wrong even the young lawyer believes is worth setting right. Her first trip in half a century to Vienna a city she vowed never to visit again where the savage events tore her family apart ends in defeat. With the aid of an Austrian journalist (Daniel Bruhl) she is able to cut through some of the bureaucratic red tape open her sisters will and open her case for review by the government authorities. Viewing the treasured Klimt canvas in the museum intercut with the Jewish persecutions her familys arrest and their lost treasures--tracing jewels artworks and a priceless Stradivarius cello to Hitlers private resort in the Alps--Mrs. Altmann comes face to face with many contemporary points of view from Austrians who want to leave the past alone and those who are still tortured by it. Back in California Maria throws in the towel but now its Randy who refuses to give up or give in. Searching for the legal loophole that will allow them to sue the Austrian government at home in the U.S. he loses his job neglects his wife and new baby and needs money badly. But something within him based on what he learns about his own familys involvement in the war drives him to regard the art works stolen by the Nazis as the wars last prisoners. Ignoring all attempts to dump Randy for powerful legal forces with deep pockets she and her idealistic attorney make it all the way to the U. S. Supreme Court and the outcome will leave you cheering. (A sense of pride for Mrs. Altmanns invincible spirit also put a few tears in my eyes.) Helen Mirren is a miraculous blend of grit grillades and grace in a performance of class and wit and unforgettable naturalism and Ryan Reynolds who is fast becoming one of the screens most reliable presences matches her every step of the way. The events are well documented so there is no such thing as a spoiler here but I think you still deserve the thrill of seeing what happens for yourself. I will simply say that in addition to a fine film if you want to see the actual Woman in Gold its on view in the elegant Neue Galerie in New York City from April 2 to September 7.

(The Weinstein Company) Photo Robert Viglasky McClatchy-Tribune News Service Woman on a quest for family justice 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The engaging but perfunctory ""Woman in Gold"" isnt exactly an exercise in subtlety but this eager-to-please film -- about a feisty Jewish woman trying to reclaim a painting stolen by the Nazis -- proves that the formidable Helen Mirren can provide interesting nuances even in a story where few exist. Mirren plays Los Angeles resident Maria Altmann who upon the death of her sister in 1998 discovers that a priceless Klimt painting of their beloved aunt Adele Bloch belongs to her not to the Belvedere Palace in Vienna. Maria is not pursuing the artwork for the big bucks -- instead she longs for the precious memory of her family from whom she was forced to flee because of the Nazi terror decades earlier. With the help of some apple strudel she enlists nerdy attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) and so begins their quest for justice. Were not entirely sure why Randol is going along for the ride but hey this is the movies. Some of the films strongest moments occur after Randol and Maria arrive in Vienna and Maria comes face to face with the beautiful painting titled ""Woman in Gold."" At this point Maria begins to relive her days in Vienna up until the time when the Nazis destroyed her close-knit familys way of life. Weve seen the images of Nazi persecution before -- many times -- but theres no denying their power. And theres no denying that director Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn"") does an excellent job of mounting these set pieces particularly a chase involving Maria and her new husband through the streets of Vienna. Making these flashbacks all the more powerful are two excellent performances Tatiana Maslany (look out for the ""Orphan Black"" star in more breakout roles) as the young Maria and Allan Corduner (heartbreaking) as Marias father. The tension tends to slacken once we return to the main story as Maria and Randol confront one-dimensional Austrian bureaucrats who seem incapable of having a reasonable discussion. None of them makes any impression beyond the ridiculous. The film based on a true story doesnt seem interested in exploring in any depth the complexities of Marias case. Its the good guys versus the bad guys -- and nothing in between. One of the other glaring issues in the script is the back-and-forth between the two main heroes. The goofy yet charming Randol provides a nice foil for the sharp-tongued Maria -- and Curtis mines this for all its comic worth -- but sometimes the odd-couple routine comes off more like a schtick than a dynamic relationship. The problem here is that Reynolds role is so underwritten that he eventually gets trapped. We dont know where hes coming from or what he really wants. When in Vienna he has an epiphany about his Jewish heritage during a visit to a Holocaust memorial the episode comes off more like a case of indigestion than self-revelation. The script leaves other good actors in the dust too. Frances Fisher as Marias friend is criminally underused (perhaps most of her performance ended up on the editing floor). Katie Holmes meanwhile gets stuck with the ever-dull role of Randols empathetic spouse; maybe she needs to have a heart to heart with her agent. Faring better in small roles (there are lots of glorified cameos here) are Elizabeth McGovern as a rational judge; Jonathan Pryce as a ditzy judge; and especially Charles Dance the lordly head of Randols law firm. Above all though its Mirren who keeps us interested. We completely believe that shes an Austrian Jew her accent her manner her pressing inner need for moral justice. Even when shes doing something as simple as brushing her hair folding a shirt or holding a doughnut she has our undivided attention. ""Woman in Gold"" wants both to delve into serious issues and to be an old-fashioned piece of Hollywood entertainment. Those arent necessarily mutually exclusive goals but the film tilts too much on the side of the latter. Maybe most viewers will prefer it that way.

The first is the story of worldly pre-war Vienna a beating heart of European culture finally stilled under Nazi oppression. The second is the story of Maria Altmann the Viennese refugee who some 60 years later fought to get back the paintings - some glorious Klimts -- that regime had stolen from her family. The third is the story of the young lawyer Randol Schoenberg who helped her take her fight to the courts. The first scenario is the most interesting one. The second is rather standard feisty-old-actress Oscar bait. The third is the dull old plot about the handsome selfless young crusader. So naturally ""Woman in Gold"" concentrates on the last two stories and only occasionally returns to the first. Thats too bad because that scenario - the story of a world we will not see again - is a fascinating one. And its full of great beauty (as we see Gustav Klimt hard at work turning out his masterpieces) and great horror (as the gay music at a wedding is drowned out by the sound of jackboots on the cobblestones). The other two stories though - those are ones weve seen before. And the fact that theyre true doesnt make them more dramatic. Helen Mirren is Altmann an elderly woman with a slight accent a small boutique and a modest life in Los Angeles. When she comes across some old family papers she realizes that the masterpieces now hanging in some Viennese museums still legally belong to her family. And shed like to get them back. So she hires Schoenberg another Austrian-American - yes his grandfather was the composer - who happens to be a family friend as well as a young and not particularly successful lawyer. And together they decide to go to Vienna to press her case. This is the largest part of the movie and unfortunately its the least interesting. Weve seen any number of these on-the-road movies recently - whether it was the Barbra Streisand comedy ""The Guilt Trip"" or the Judi Dench drama ""Philomena"" - and they derive too much of their occasional humor from a bluntly impatient old lady annoying a long-suffering and somewhat uptight young man. Its all a little tired and condescending - like some screenwriters self-serving memories of his last trip to see Mom - and having Mirren occasionally exclaim what fun or thrills theyre having doesnt make it so. (It doesnt help that there have already been several documentaries about this story.) Worse this movie keeps cutting back to Schoenbergs dull home life so bland hes married to Katie Holmes (who in the midst of labor picks out his tie before asking him to just drop her off at the hospital). Not too much conflict here and coupled with Ryan Reynolds typically inert performance - his gaze has all the fire of a teddy bears - the drama dissipates. It picks up again whenever the movie slips into flashbacks - and how could it not with Viennese salons and Nazis and a rush-to-the-airport escape that plays like ""Casablanca""? And there are a few moments of real emotion from Mirren mixing both her hunger for justice and her eagerness to forget the past. Except its only when the movie remembers it that it really connects. Ratings note The film contains some strong language. Woman in Gold (PG-13) Weinstein (109 min.) Directed by Simon Curtis. With Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds.

But the film is too straightforward and rote even though its a true story.Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynolds in a scene from the film ""Woman in Gold.""(Photo Robert Viglasky/Weinstein Company/AP Photo)Story Highlights2.5 stars (out of 5)The film is based on a true story.Reynolds is a good actor but he is miscast. Mirrens presence is always welcome and elevates the film.""Woman in Gold"" is one of those movies with a message and one of those movies thats going to make damn sure you receive that message no matter what.That can make it kind of a drag at times as director Simon Curtis slogs through moral certainties he evidently does not trust us to pick up on though most people would probably side against Nazis no matter what the context. His heroine -- played by Helen Mirren which helps a lot -- is a complex character and Mirren is always fascinating to watch.But everyone else in the film simply fills out obvious roles. Yes its based on a true story a story that is compelling in its own right. But that doesnt mean the filmmakers get a free pass in presenting it to us.Mirren plays Maria Altmann a refugee from Vienna who escaped to America with her husband during World War II. When her sister dies she goes through old papers and realizes that she has claim to several works of art by Gustav Klimt most notably ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" -- a portrait of Marias beloved aunt.The portrait eventually revered as Viennas ""Mona Lisa"" (and known as the ""Woman in Gold"") was displayed in the Belvedere Palace according to Adeles will. But Adele did not actually have rights to the painting; her husband commissioned it. How it went from Marias family to the palace involves Nazi theft of art a crooked curator and more. But now in the 1990s Maria wants it back.Related Director Simon Curtis concentrating on films for nowShe employs Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) the son of a friend a good lawyer who has made some bad career decisions. But now he has a new job a wife (Katie Holmes doing almost nothing) and a baby on the way.What he doesnt have -- few people do evidently -- is any experience in this kind of case which has very little precedent. He meets with Maria because his mother makes him but he simply has no time or interest.Until he finds out the painting is worth millions.Curtis cant decide from this point what kind of movie he wants to make. Its part mismatched-buddy comedy with Randol convincing Maria to travel back to Vienna with him (she swore she would never return and insists on speaking English while there).But in flashbacks we see the younger Maria (Tatiana Maslany of ""Orphan Black"") a member of a wealthy Jewish family humiliated and stolen from; she and her husband flee in an exciting chase scene.Then there is Randols metamorphosis. Hes the grandson of the Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg. Hes aware of the Holocaust of course but it hasnt haunted him.Yet.Meanwhile there are the legal proceedings -- another genre heard from. Theyre mostly an opportunity for Randol to deliver speech after speech. Maria can get to the point with an economy of expression. Randol does not possess that gift.Then there are the art officials in Vienna. I dont know who the Viennese version of Simon Legree is but these people would certainly suffice in the role. Theyre greedy and evil.Luckily we have Mirren on the other side so our rooting interest is clear. But the story is so one-sided wed root for her if Megan Fox played the role.Thankfully she didnt. Reynolds is a good actor but hes miscast. Mirren is great and she makes ""Woman in Gold"" better than it otherwise would have been. Still its just kind of boring and straightforward even if its inspiration is not.Woman in Gold2.5 stars (out of 5) Director Simon Curtis.Cast Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Daniel Bruel.Rating PG-13 for some thematic elements and brief strong language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo Credit AP / Robert Viglasky advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The true story of a woman trying reclaim a valuable Klimt painting stolen by the Nazis. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE Rich details but thin characters make for a disappointingly flat drama. CAST Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Katie Holmes LENGTH 140 ""Woman in Gold"" opens with the image of gold leaf being gingerly handled by the painter Gustav Klimt. The leaf is so thin that a breath can flatten it and so delicate that static yanks it toward a canvas. We are watching Klimt played briefly by Moritz Bleibtreu painstakingly create the titular star of this movie a 1907 painting titled ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I."" It graced the Vienna apartment of the Jewish family that commissioned it until the Nazis annexed Austria pulled it from the wall and kept it for themselves. ""Woman in Gold"" tells the true story -- with some poetic license -- of Maria Altmann a relative of the Bloch-Bauers who as a young woman escaped the Anschluss and began a new life in America. In the late 1990s Maria (Helen Mirren) now a widow living in Los Angeles decides to reclaim the portrait of her Aunt Adele. Easier said than done Klimts canvas has become one of Austrias national treasures a centerpiece of the famed Belvedere Gallery. Maria however is determined to right this wrong. ""People forget you see"" she tells her newly hired lawyer Randol ""Randy"" Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds). ""Especially the young."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Its one of many noble sentiments in ""Woman in Gold"" but the movie feels about as substantial as that gold leaf. Its filled with rich factual and visual details -- the glossy direction is from Simon Curtis and the painting itself is a dazzling re-creation by scenic artist Steve Mitchell -- but the characters and story are paper-thin. Reynolds Randy is an amiable blank (Katie Holmes as his wife barely even appears) while Mirrens Maria wavers erratically between crusader and quitter. Nuance is absent The Austrian bureaucrats are so snide and superior that they nearly resemble the Nazis we see in flashbacks; Daniel Bruhl plays Hubertus Czernin a helpful Viennese journalist with his own sob story. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsMore coverageRafer Guzmans latest Alexi K. Campbells screenplay follows a predictable blueprint of other Weinstein Company movies particularly ""The Kings Speech"" ""Philomena"" and ""The Railway Man."" Its an ankle-deep story that feels even shallower when we learn what ultimately became of Adeles portrait (and a handful of sister Klimts). No spoilers but the outcome does not fully stir the heart.

Helen Mirren left and Ryan Reynoldsstar in Woman in Gold. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Robert Viglasky) ORG XMIT CAET224(Photo Robert Viglasky AP)Woman in Golds true story of a gilded painting stolen by the Nazis is intrinsically fascinating but it lacks luster due to stodgy storytelling.The standard bio-pic approach seems too simplistic for the subject matter ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13) and it comes across as even stodgier when compared to the contested painting of such luminous beauty Gustav Klimts 1907 masterpiece dubbed ""Lady in Gold.""Helen Mirren plays the imperious Austrian-born Maria Altmann a member of a distinguished Jewish family who fled Vienna during WWII at age 21 with her husband Fritz. They eventually settled in Los Angeles as did her sister. She did her best to block out the savagery of Nazi soldiers who stormed into her familys palatial apartment and confiscated what they wanted.

VPCMaria doesnt look back but she discovers a letter in her late sisters belongings about recovering five stolen Klimt paintings all on display in Viennas Belvedere Gallery.In 1998 she enlists the help of lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) a family friend and grandson of the composer Arnold Schoenberg. Maria asks Randy to help her reclaim Klimts masterwork which depicts her beloved aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer.USA TODAYWoman in Gold relives a lesson in art and historyInitially hes not interested but when he learns of the paintings importance Randy travels to Vienna to challenge the Austrian government.Maria has not returned to Vienna and isnt sure she can face the painful memories. But she summons the courage and goes. The film traces their dogged effort to reclaim a work of art that became an Austrian national treasure. The struggle takes them to the U.S. Supreme Court then back to Vienna to face government hierarchy. The case was settled in 2006 when the famous painting (and four others) returned to Altmann.Along the way the story also focuses on the emotions haunting the octogenarian Maria. It is in those scenes that Woman in Gold shines brightly. However riveting chunks from her real-life history are omitted. Fritz was detained in Dachau. How did he escape? The couple made it out of Austria to England and then to the U.S. But how? Granted its a sprawling and complex saga but it might have benefited from fewer repetitious scenes of Maria and Randy facing off against one-dimensional Viennese officials and more about her past.Gold is blandly directed by Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) with speechifying and thudding dialogue undermining the extraordinary nature of the tale. About halfway into the film flashbacks of the young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) and her harrowing escape from the Nazis infuse the film with much-needed life. A scene in which she says goodbye to her father Gustav (Allan Corduner) is particularly poignant.The film is saved by engaging performances from Mirren and Reynolds who shine as their characters relationship deepens. (The subject was also covered in more depth in a wonderful 2006 documentary called The Rape of Europa.)Woman in Gold is an inherently heartwarming story made particularly satisfying by the fact that justice is served in time for Maria to savor it. But its hard not to wish it had delved deeper. 63 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bP7oIG",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/31/woman-in-gold-review/70720204/,200,womaningold23,womaningold,usatoday

EntertainmentMovies Woman in Gold sparks interest in true tale of stolen art Originally published March 31 2015 at 305 pm Updated April 1 2015 at 934 am ""Woman in Gold"" stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds. (Robert Viglasky / The Associated Press) A movie review of ""Woman in Gold"" starring Helen Mirren as a woman who spent many years fighting the Austrian government to reclaim paintings stolen by the Nazis. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic A great story doesnt always translate into a great movie even when Helen Mirrens on hand. ""Woman in Gold"" the based-on-fact tale of an elderly woman who spent many years fighting the Austrian government to reclaim paintings stolen from her family by the Nazis is not at all a bad movie particularly when Mirrens on screen doing that wonderfully imperious-but-vulnerable thing that she does so very well. But you watch wondering how much is the real story and how much is movie sweetening -- and after seeing the films touching final title cards briefly describing the fates of the characters I couldnt help wishing for a documentary version. Mirren plays Maria Altmann a woman from a wealthy art-loving Austrian family who fled Vienna and the Nazis as a newlywed in the late 1930s eventually settling in Los Angeles. When we first meet her its 1998 and shes all too aware of the fleeting passage of time. Buttonholing a young L.A. attorney (Ryan Reynolds) whos a family friend she tells him of Gustav Klimts ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"" a glittering gold-encrusted painting of her aunt. Now a famous work of art it hangs in a gallery in Austria and Maria has learned that her late sister made attempts to return the work and others to their family. Taking up the cause with the help of idealistic lawyer Randy she becomes determined to see justice -- and restitution -- done. The storys told with frequent flashbacks to wartime Austria with Tatiana Maslany (""Orphan Black"") as the young Maria and Antje Traue an arresting beauty as her aunt Adele. Movie Review    Woman in Gold with Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Daniel Bruhl Katie Holmes Tatiana Maslany Max Irons Charles Dance Antje Traue. Directed by Simon Curtis from a screenplay by Alexi Kaye Campbell. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some thematic elements and brief strong language. Several theaters. Maria Altmanns story was a small part of the fine documentary ""The Rape of Europa"" a few years back; it well deserves a film of its own. ""Woman in Gold"" falters in places Reynolds bland screen quality doesnt help his underwritten character and every scene of his home life (with Katie Holmes as his wife) manages to be both dull and implausible. But Mirren as you might expect takes hold of the movie and steers it home. Her Maria is unfailingly tough (""I have decided to face the ghosts"" she says of her return to Austria after 60 years) with the precise posture of a woman who perpetually expects to face challenge and when she finally breaks down late in the movie its extraordinarily moving. Its a performance that leaves you wanting to know more about this woman and her life; more than the intriguing ""Woman in Gold"" is set to tell.

(Weinstein Co.)The painting stolen by the Nazis and after WWII found hanging in Austrias national museum is a portrait of the litigants aunt.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted April 02 2015The woman in gold in the true story Woman in Gold was Adele Bloch-Bauer a patron of the arts in turn-of-the-century Vienna a regal beauty who posed for Gustav Klimt. Her portrait hung in the familys apartment on the Elisabethstrasse until March 1938 when Hitlers Third Reich annexed Austria. The lives of the citys thriving Jewish community were forever changed and the Klimt along with other artwork jewelry and valuables belonging to the Bloch-Bauers was seized by the Nazis.After World War II the painting found its way to the national museum where it hung for decades. Austrias Mona Lisa. Enter Maria Altmann Adeles niece who as a young bride on the eve of war had escaped Europe ultimately landing in Los Angeles. Altmann as sprightly octogenarian is played by Helen Mirren.""What do you know about art restitution?"" she asks an inexperienced California lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) thinking that perhaps its time to get back what is rightfully hers.He doesnt know much.With that the Simon Curtis-directed film chronicling Altmann and Schoenbergs five-year-plus battle in courtrooms from California to Washington to Vienna is off and running. Similar in ways to Philomena - a young man accompanying an older woman on a journey through history each learning from the other - Woman in Gold finds Mirren delivering her lines with bite and humor and a Bavarian lilt. Her Maria is a stolid heroine whose adventures as a refugee are revealed in flashback (Tatiana Maslany plays her as a young woman). When the film returns to the present tense (the first decade of the new millennium) defiance and determination well up in Mirrens eyes.Aiding Maria and ""Randy"" Schoenberg (grandson of Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg) in their daunting pursuit is Hubertus Czernin (Daniel BrA1/4hl) an investigative journalist on a mission to expose his countrys culpability during Hitlers reign.For a film with such dark themes Woman in Gold has an almost jaunty step. Mirren Reynolds and BrA1/4hl each get their chance to display apt emotions - rage regret sadness shame the pluck to stand up to powerful officials and high-priced lawyers. But Curtis whose first feature as a director was the (real-life) Hollywood fairy tale My Week With Marilyn doesnt appear to have a gravitas gear. Even when he heads into a Holocaust flashback the movie hums along well-oiled heading for triumph. The transformation of Reynolds lawyer from a bumbler and stumbler to a victorious litigator sticking it to an entire nation is the stuff of a Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart pic.Not that theres anything wrong with that. Woman in Gold has a great story to tell and the filmmakers have opted for the safest slickest way to tell it. A Woman in Gold  (Out of four stars) Directed by Simon Curtis. With Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Daniel BrA1/4hl Katie Holmes.

Which brings us to ""Woman in Gold"" a film that could have been a stirring saga of family pain and artistic restitution but instead feels like a movie youve already seen more than once and didnt care for all that much the first time. Director Simon Curtis (""My Week with Marilyn"") and first-time screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell take everything unpredictable and moving about this real-life struggle and break it down into obvious and easily-digestible components as though they were adding water to packets marked ""underdogs against the system"" ""sharp older lady befriends quiet young man"" and ""Nazi occupation of Europe."" See Video Helen Mirren Ryan Reynolds Reclaim Nazi-Stolen Art in Woman in Gold Trailer (Video) Helen Mirren the one reason to see this film at all stars as Maria Altmann a woman who emigrated to Southern California decades earlier after fleeing Nazi-occupied Austria. She and her husband managed to flee but they had to leave behind family friends and treasured objects chief among them Gustav Klimts legendary ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer."" (Adele played here by Antje Traue was Marias aunt.) Learning that Austria is making some efforts at restitution to those whose properties were seized by the Nazis Maria engages attorney Randy ""Randy"" Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to help her in her quest to reclaim the painting. Randy having just landed a job at a prestigious L.A. firm after his attempts to go into business for himself failed isnt exactly in a position to take on any extracurricular work but when he discovers the painting is worth around 180 million he convinces his bosses to let him take the case. Returning to Austria dredges up painful memories for Maria the beauty of growing up in a household where artists and intellectuals visited as well as the horror of the occupation when Jews were stripped of property mocked in the street and ultimately carted off to the camps. Randy the grandson of legendary composer Arnold Schoenberg also lost Viennese relatives in the Holocaust but neither the film nor Reynolds performance gives us much of an idea of what impact that has on him although he does go through the requisite shift of believing in Marias cause and no longer caring about the money. (Maria doesnt even want the painting for herself; its justice she seeks.) The Austrians efforts at restitution are mostly lip service per local journalist Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Bruhl) who happily provides some inside help to Maria and Randy to state the case that the painting was stolen from Adele and not as the authorities argue bequeathed by her to a local gallery. The legal battles against the Austrian government take our plucky heroes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before they ultimately face off in a Viennese arbitration hearing. Also Read The Audience Theater Review Helen Mirren Peter Morgan Dust Off Their Queen You can pretty much see every story beat coming from Maria briefly giving up on her seemingly impossible quest to Randys wife (Katie Holmes badly underused) lamenting that hes going to lose his job when theyve got another baby on the way. Even the flashbacks to the Nazis (featuring ""Orphan Black"" star Tatiana Maslany as young Maria) feel like an amalgam of moments weve seen in decades worth of other better films about the Third Reich. (And lest were ever unclear about how we should feel about any plot twist the score by Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer hammers it home with very little subtlety.) See Images Deadpool First Look Ryan Reynolds Channels Burt Reynolds Lounges in Front of a Fire (Photo) Mirrens work is the standout here making Maria proud defiant bitter sad and resourceful in turn but always an empathetic human being. Its a marked contrast to see her and Reynolds side by side - you can see her creating her character from the inside out while hes working from the externals (starting with an oversize pair of eyeglasses doing most of the heavy lifting) inward. Elsewhere Reynolds has superior comic timing and is capable of genuine screen charisma but in ""Woman in Gold"" you can see the effort and he never registers as anything but an actor acting. Unless youre a Helen Mirren completist ""Woman in Gold"" offers nothing that a documentary or even a long magazine article about Altmann and Schoenbergs triumph couldnt have captured better. For a film about a timeless painting its surprisingly artless. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

All Rights Reserved. The story of Gustav Klimts painting The Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer (confiscated by Nazis displayed as Austrias Mona Lisa in a Vienna museum test case in the law granting reparations to Jewish descendants) has already been detailed in articles a book and several documentaries. What Woman in Gold has over nonfiction portrayals is emotion and director Simon Curtis (My Week With Marilyn) milks every scene for its heart-tugging potential. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Alexi Kaye Campbells script makes it easy for Curtis The relationship between Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) whose aunt is depicted in Klimts famous golden portrait and attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) is constructed as a platonic romance. From their awkward first meeting through trials that test their union to a life-altering conclusion the legal case is always recounted through the filter of their relationship. Mirren and Reynolds have great chemistry and their odd couple -- shes regal and sharp-witted hes rumpled and steely-eyed -- banter with easy humor and deep affection. Curtis also flashes back to a lost Vienna where the wealthy Bloch-Bauers were major art patrons (and friends of Randols grandfather composer Arnold Schoenberg) scenes enlivened by Tatiana Maslany. Film Details Woman in Gold RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time110 min. More Info Trailer Mirrens Maria is a careful construction but Maslanys Maria is intense and quick-witted saying goodbye to her parents with profound tenderness and fleeing Nazis with heart-pounding determination. Woman in Gold suffers from biopic oversights (Marias children arent mentioned nor is her husbands brief internment at Dachau) but Curtiss greatest oversimplification is viewing this fraught process as primarily a form of family reunification.1 Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I by Gustav Klimt.Wikipedia Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Serena Donadoni Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Photo The Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW Woman in Gold Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (tastefully evil Nazis). Even the great Helen Mirren can do only so much to elevate this relentlessly mediocre fact-inspired drama. She plays Maria Altmann an octogenarian refugee living in California who successfully battles the Austrian government to recover Gustav Klimts famous portrait of her aunt (Antje Traue) which was stolen from her family by the Nazis. Under Harvey Weinsteins sponsorship this remarkable story has become a paint-by-numbers variation on the producers far better ""Philomena."" Here Mirrens feisty Altmann recruits the son of a family friend whos a corporate lawyer -- and grandson of noted composer Arnold Schoenberg -- to help in her quest. Ryan Reynolds and Helen Mirren.Photo The Weinstein Company Played by a severely miscast Ryan Reynolds hes at first a reluctant partner with a pregnant wife (Katie Holmes). But he becomes obsessed with obtaining justice for Altmann after an Austrian journalist (an under-used Daniel Bruhl) helps uncover documents hidden by government officials. ""Woman in Gold"" is directed without inspiration by TV veteran Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn""). Working from a heavy-handed script he deploys an impressive ensemble (Charles Dance Elizabeth McGovern Jonathan Pryce Henry Goodman Frances Fisher Max Irons) all confined to one-note roles that flash back and forth between prewar Vienna and 1990s courtrooms.

March 31 2015 -- 333pm Weinstein Co. Ryan Reynolds Helen Mirren and Daniel Bruhl in ""Woman in Gold."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Gustav Klimts haunting masterpiece his 1907 ""Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" mixes vivid classic-style portraiture with innovative modernism. It gives Adele a wealthy art-loving young socialite the beautiful facial features of a woman of great standing covering her with clothing of glittering gold leaf. Austrians considered it their equivalent of the Mona Lisa treasuring it in their national museum when the Jewish heiress died decades later. Unfortunately for Bloch-Bauers heirs the Austrian State Gallery refused to return it to family survivors. The rich but uneven human interest story ""Woman in Gold"" follows the bitter court battles of elderly Maria Altmann niece of the prewar owner. Directed by Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn"") and the scripting debut for English playwright Alexi Kaye Campbell the film copies Klimts dazzling fusion of classic and art nouveau techniques but stops short of creating a masterwork. Marias remembered scenes of Nazi violence against Jews are suitable for an Anne Frank tragedy. But to avoid a downer drama the film focuses equally on Marias 1938 wartime flight from Vienna and her new life as a refugee in Los Angeles. Superbly played by Helen Mirren Maria is no boring character from the Marigold Hotel but a gruff smart invasive sometimes annoying drama queen determined to give the new generation of Austrian state art thieves the fight of their lives. ""It would have been a lot better for us all"" she declares ""if Hitler had spent his life doing tacky paintings."" Humor meet tragedy. Ryan Reynolds is miscast as her rather bashful lawyer Randy Schoenberg moving into nebbish territory we have never seen from him. His partnership with the difficult Maria feels like a role reversal of ""Philomena"" the far more entertaining Steve Coogan and Judi Dench intergenerational drama. Maria an acerbic octogenarian is bulls-eye sharp about what she wants whether or not Randy likes it. woman in gold  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some thematic elements and brief strong language. Theater Lagoon. When Randy learns that the painting is worth a staggering 135 million he begins late-night sessions in bed boning up on art restitution law provoking the not-always-supportive response of his pregnant wife (Katie Holmes in a superficial cameo). When not returning to the Nazi regimes war crimes the story becomes a rather legalistic quest for justice. Campbells cumbersome dialogue often sounds copied from legal documents. Randy becomes so focused on returning Marias lost treasure that the boss of his firm insists that he drop the case grumbling ""Do you think that a painting that ends up as a fridge magnet will ever leave Austria?"" A visit to a Holocaust memorial triggers a torrent of memories connecting him with his own long-ignored Jewish heritage. Rushing into a nearby public toilet he frees a melodramatic surge of tears.

For elderly Los Angeles resident Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) the paintings a uniquely personal touchstone. A portrait of her beloved Aunt Adele its also a painful reminder of the lives home and property wrenched from her Viennese family during the Nazi occupation of Austria. By the late 1990s however changes in Austrian law allow for the restitution of looted treasures to their rightful owners so crotchety but the always indefatigable Maria and her junior lawyer Randol (Ryan Reynolds) begin an against-the-odds battle for justice against a Viennese gallery thats run by the state. Its potent material that becomes the stuff of a workmanlike true-life drama spoon-feeding its audience a steady diet of speeches and schmaltz. Matters proceed along smoothly pedestrian lines with scheming Austrian bureaucrats balanced out by a conciliatory local journalist (Daniel Bruhl). Mirren and Reynolds capably riff on their comedic odd-couple dynamic and the legal processes are reduced to a string of neat sound bites. Marias return to the city of her traumatic youth prompts ungainly structured flashbacks but Mirrens performance conveying both vulnerability and determination is a moving evocation of the travails and rewards of seeking accommodation with a nightmare past. But the clunky often superficial movie around her tames the anger and anguish of memory for a well-meaning but feel-good ""prestige"" product.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Robert Viglasky) Share Photo""Woman in Gold"" has a rich story to tell. The true account of Maria Altmanns fight to reclaim a famed Gustav Klimt painting of her aunt ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" first stolen by the Nazis and then appropriated by Austria after the war is laced with riveting history deep and complex emotion and fascinating bureaucracy. Yet director Simon Curtiss rendering of Altmanns tale though respectful and pretty is somehow lifeless.There is almost too much here for a single movie. Curtis who charmed with his Marilyn Monroe slice of life ""My Week with Marilyn"" relies on a combination of flashbacks of Marias pre-war life in Vienna and the present day tick-tock of her legal quest to take ownership of the painting.Played in the present by Helen Mirren Maria is a prickly woman with a thick Austrian accent. She owns a boutique in a fancy part of Los Angeles and following the death of her sister has made up her mind that she would like to claim what is hers. The man she convinces to help her is Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) a dull corporate lawyer with a prestigious pedigree and a few poor career choices on his resume.Its been over 60 years since Maria fled Austria during World War II and she is sickened by the thought of returning refusing to even speak the language when they arrive abroad to plead their case. In Vienna theyre helped by a young native journalist (Daniel Bruhl) who functions mostly as a human exposition vehicle.With two actors as charming as Mirren and Reynolds anchoring the story its a bit disarming that their charisma never really manages to energize the sluggish tale. Part of that is for effect -- theyre supposed to grow to love and admire one another while he learns to respect her history -- but the eventual payoff doesnt connect. These characters arent equipped to deliver the lively generational comedy that this story so desperately needs.The flashbacks ranging from Marias childhood to her early 20s (""Orphan Blacks"" Tatiana Maslany) are meant to contextualize Marias plight. We see a spirited girls life upended by the war the brutality of the Nazi regime and the faceless indifference of her fellow countrymen. But seeped in the obligatory sepia and lace these sequences are as adventurous as a paint-by-numbers with the exception of a heart-pounding chase sequence.A recurring theme throughout the film is that everyone has forgotten the horrors of the Holocaust -- that no one really cares about the living history of so many. Its an interesting question but ""Woman in Gold"" doesnt have the guts to go too deep on that or any of the complexities around Marias quest.Also instead of engaging in any dialogue about the idea of reclamation the film has a predetermined moral narrative. From the beginning the Austrians are portrayed as thieving greedy petty and wholly disinterested in the past traumas of its exiled citizens.It doesnt even really function as a thrilling legal drama even when they reach the Supreme Court of the United States. Every victory and ""ah-ha"" moment plays like a shrug. Perhaps the lesson is that there is no actual triumph in reclamation.As for Randy with a wife and a baby at home and a brand new job at a prestigious firm on the line he has no reason to get tangled up with Maria. At one point he cries that he only said yes because he discovered the worth of the paintings but as his professional life caves in around this long fight his motives become even more bewildering. The movie tells us that he matures but it fails to show it in a meaningful way.""Woman in Gold"" reaches for glossy based-on-a-true-story cinematic heights with the depth of one of its made-for-television counterparts.""Woman in Gold"" a Weinstein Company release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""some thematic elements and brief strong language.""

Theres a long history of mediocre filmmaking being given a pass because the phrase ""remarkable true story"" is attached and Woman in Gold will likely slot into that tradition. Criticizing Simon Curtis emphatic chronicle of the battle of Austrian-Jewish Holocaust refugee Maria Altmann to recover the Gustav Klimt painting stolen by the Nazis from her family risks being misread as disrespect for the countless people who endured similar violations many of them still awaiting restitution. But while Helen Mirren elevates the material with her usual aplomb and the events being depicted inevitably are stirring this is a stodgy crusade-for-justice drama directed and written with minimal flair. Altmann had lived in California since fleeing Europe with her husband during World War II when the death of her sister brought documents to light concerning a number of Klimt paintings and other valuables looted by the Nazis from the home of her well-heeled Viennese family. One of the Klimts in particular had special significance to her. A dazzling art nouveau masterwork richly embellished with gold leaf it depicted her beloved aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer who had lived with the Altmanns until her untimely death from meningitis at age 43 and was virtually a second mother to Maria and her sister. Hanging in the Belvedere Palace since the war the painting had come to be regarded as Austrias ""Mona Lisa"" while the museum had conveniently buried the paperwork concerning its provenance. This first step into screenwriting for Brit playwright Alexi Kaye Campbell suffers from a general lack of economy and a tendency to spell out its righteous indignation in speechy dialogue even when the characters arent at a podium or in a courtroom. Mirrens characterization as Maria however is the classy exception. Shes first seen speaking at her sisters funeral in Los Angeles in 1998 and instantly we understand this woman from her impeccable Euro-chic appearance to her proud bearing to the acerbic edge that suggests her internalized sense of moral outrage. Even Mirrens Austrian accent is crisply understated. With brisk wont-take-no-for-an-answer efficiency Maria enlists the help of struggling young lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to look over papers and see if she has a case to retrieve her family possessions including the Klimt portrait. If Mirren is well cast Reynolds is the opposite and not just because everything about him screams ""goy."" The son of a judge and grandson of the famed composer Randy represents a generation descended from Holocaust survivors who have often struggled to share the burdens of memory. Playing against type with a nerd makeover of cheap suit glasses and physical clumsiness Reynolds gives a routine impression of the characters arc from guilt-induced obligation through professional opportunity to dogged determination and ennobled conviction. That latter galvanic transformation comes in a ham-fisted scene in which a visit to the Jewish Holocaust Memorial in Vienna sends Randy scurrying to the mens room to vent scalding tears of anger. Its not that the emotions wont be real and relatable for millions of refugee descendants but the actors characterization is too superficial to be convincing. Scenes of Randy obsessively boning up on restitution law at home add little with Katie Holmes on thankless duty as his supportive wife. Despite some inelegant lurching between past and present the film is most absorbing when Maria rethinks her refusal ever to return to Austria and accompanies Randy on their first trip to file a request with the national restitution committee. That visit uncorks a flood of memories in which shes played as a soulful young woman by Orphan Black breakout star Tatiana Maslany. Maria relives her courtship and marriage to handsome opera singer Fritz (Max Irons); the elegant salons of her youth in a sumptuous old-world apartment frequented by the most distinguished artists of the time; and the intoxicating influence of her glamorous Aunt Adele (Antje Traue). Hers was a family that relished such rituals as the Saturday-evening recitals of her father Gustav (Allan Corduner) on his Stradivarius cello another treasure seized by the Nazis. Aided by a local journalist (Daniel Bruhl) driven by his own moral compass to redress the injustices of the past the present-day Maria and Randy encounter bureaucratic hurdles at every step. The Belvedere administration and Austrian culture minister are predictably defensive over the threat of the museums star attraction being removed. These experiences trigger increasingly disturbing memories for Maria the stationing of a Nazi watchdog in her home; the cruel public humiliation of fellow Viennese Jews; the closing of the borders for departing citizens; and the heartwrenching choices she is forced to make when Fritz finds a means of escape. While that backstory is highly compelling Campbells script too often gets in the way with its on-the-nose dialogue. One notable example is a farewell scene in which Gustav switches from German to English telling Maria ""Listen to me now in the language of your future."" As justification not to have to subtitle an emotional climax its pretty feeble. A brief prologue showing Adele posing for Klimt (played as a mad monk by Moritz Bleibtreu) is handled awkwardly. But director Curtis who previously dramatized history in My Week With Marilyn generally does well enough with the recreations of the past assisted by solid work from production designer Jim Clay and costumer Beatrix Pasztor. But when the newly impassioned Randy refuses to comply with the wishes of the disheartened Maria hauling the case through American courts and then back to Vienna for another inspirational showdown the film becomes a pedestrian legal drama. The appearance in judicial robes of name actors like Elizabeth McGovern and Jonathan Pryce serves mainly to underline the productions somewhat self-congratulatory feel about relating a story of sociopolitical importance. Failing to layer suspense into the drama by more subtle means Curtis instead attempts to stuff tension and emotional weight into every scene via an omnipresent score by Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer that leans hard on every button. Through it all the ineffably dignified Mirren rises above the occasion even when the movie abandons restraint to milk her characters legitimate pain and eventual bittersweet triumph for sentiment. Its a moving story of social injustice put right and it deserves a less heavy-handed retelling. Opens Friday April 3 (Weinstein Co.)

Gustav Klimt may have been celebrated for his gilded portraits of elegant Austrian ladies but that doesnt necessarily mean the same approach suits ""Woman in Gold"" director Simon Curtis garish ""good taste"" account of how a determined Jewish exile (played by Helen Mirren) sought the restitution of a Klimt painting seized by the Nazis. Weinsteined to within an inch of its life this compelling true story forbids any room for perfectly reasonable arthouse audiences to question Maria Altmanns case striking back at the anti-Semitism of the time with an equally noxious caricature of modern Austrians as law-bending art-thieving monsters. In other words ""My Week With Marilyn"" director Curtis and screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell (a theater talent making his bigscreen debut) have taken the position that theres no room for debate where rectifying the wrongs of Austrias past is concerned which makes for a reasonably dull ride as both director and scribe take a fairly predictable paint-by-numbers approach to the subject of fine art -- a category for which the film itself could scarcely be mistaken. This is manufactured sentiment less interested in provoking thought than in manipulating emotion constructed of human obstacles overcome stirring speeches delivered and heart-rending flashbacks unveiled all suspended like so much Spam in the jelly of its own score -- so much heavy-handed strings-and-pianos business from Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer plastered on more liberally than the gold leaf applied by Klimt himself. Ah Klimt. The artist makes a distractingly corny cameo early on (played by popular German actor Moritz Bleibtreu) in which he caresses his model Adele Block-Bauer (Antje Traue) as she sits for her famous portrait. He will resurface at the end to smile approvingly upon the outcome of Altmanns case despite the fact that the Austrian government had effectively honored the wording of Adeles will proudly displaying ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" for some 60 years in Viennas Belvedere Palace. But -- and this is no small thing -- the painting was not Adeles to give. It was commissioned and paid for by her industrialist husband (renowned Jewish stage actor Henry Goodman) confiscated by German authorities under false pretenses and acquired eight years later in 1941 by Belvedere curator Bruno Grimschitz -- one of the movies many bureaucratic supervillains whose unfortunate-sounding moniker Campbell exploits for a cheap laugh. (Nearly all the jokes amount to schoolyard-quality jibes.) Obviously not all Austrians are as evil as the film would have audiences believe but Grimschitz was a heel He knew the artworks provenance scrubbed its Jewishness and rechristened the painting ""Golden Portrait"" (later ""The Lady in Gold""). More than half a century later now living in Los Angeles and played by a lightly accented and eccentrically fussy Mirren Altmann sets out to reclaim what was rightfully hers though the odds are against her Though Austria has publicly stated it intends to return stolen artworks to their rightful owners this particular piece has since become the countrys Mona Lisa. ""Do you think that a painting that ends up as a fridge magnet will ever leave Austria?"" asks the wonderfully stern Charles Dance evidently on loan from ""The Imitation Game"" (hes just one of many distinguished thesps doing day-player duty in the film including Elizabeth McGovern and Jonathan Pryce as federal judges respectively). Working family connections to find a lawyer Altmann enlists nervous ""schoolboy"" Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds shockingly miscast) the grandson of Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg whose music was deemed ""degenerate"" by the Nazi culture police (but if sparingly applied might have made a more fitting score than the one slathered thickly over every scene). With a pregnant wife (Katie Holmes) at home the young Schoenberg is far out of his depth handling a case such as this for which there is very limited precedent and though Campbells screenplay attempts to convey the finer legal points raised by Altmanns claim the film is ultimately more interested in some higher sense of justice. One dimension of that justice involves the films right to re-create in painfully melodramatic terms the mistreatment of Jews by their Austrian countrymen in the early 30s. In stark contrast with the hyper-saturated contemporary footage (unusually bright for typically gothic d.p. Ross Emery) Curtis depicts festive rallies in which the Viennese people enthusiastically welcomed their Nazi occupiers. He shows Jewish families forced to scrub sidewalks and kneel quietly while rowdy onlookers cheered their humiliation. Seeing as how the national attitude was permitted to unfairly denigrate an entire race at the time the film returns the favor presenting all Austrians as cardboard villains -- cruel greedy and staunchly unhelpful -- with just two exceptions Profil magazine editor Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Bruhl) who assists Altmann in the present and a kindly washerwoman who helped her to escape a fleeing Nazi officer (rising star Tom Schilling) so many years ago. The film makes it a point to dramatize this cruelty in German presenting English as Altmanns liberated language going so far as to transition between the two in a choked-up scene between the young Maria (""Orphan Blacks"" Tatiana Maslany) and her father (Alain Corduner). Nuance is nowhere to be found in Curtis strong-arm approach and though a certain audience wont object to being forced how to feel theres a monumental issue at stake here that the film scarcely acknowledges Does (or should) anyone really own art? At a moment when the music and movie industries have all but lost control of their own product and the public feels more entitled than ever to access such media for free what does it mean for the worlds most valuable paintings to remain in private hands? (The prickly subject served as the backbone of the 2006 docu ""The Rape of Europa"" but is hardly limited to Nazi activity affecting everything from looted antiquities in the Getty collection to the return of Pragues Lobkowicz Palace after the fall of communism in the Czech Republic.) After winning her case Altmann removed the Bloch-Bauer portrait from the Belvedere Palace and sold it to Ronald Lauder (ghoulishly portrayed in a short scene here) for the record sum of 135 million. Now like Altmann herself the Austrian masterpiece was sent to live abroad. The film goes out of its way to stress that her fight was not about the money. It would be nice to buy a new washer machine she admits at one point. As for the filmmakers theyre doing it to see the looks on the faces of all those nasty Austrians. Picture a screengrab of that moment displayed in the Belvedere where ""The Lady in Gold"" once hung. Priceless.

Kate says June 22 2016 at 830 pm Exactly what is the writers problem? Why minimize the Holocaust or criticize a film that focuses on its lasting effects? Yes...that is the true subject of the film. Apparently Mr. Debruge has a problem with that? It appears that this piece was written by someone in love with their self-supposed dazzling sarcasm and wit. Those surly Austrians depicted in the film have the same issue that your article does. They dont take a wide scale loss of livelihood and life seriously and have only their own interests in mind. I look forward to reading your nostalgic reviews of ""Schindlers List"" and ""Life is Beautiful."" Reply donnajeanne says June 19 2016 at 1050 am This movie was a wonderful story and very well done personally I loved it so very much. It was so unlike all the shoot um up action movies out there this was a story of love survival and courage and best of all it was based on a true story and the acting was superb from all the actors. Want to see it again and again. Reply Traci says June 11 2016 at 636 pm Wow. Im having a hard time understanding why this reviewer is employed by Variety. Are your owners and editors as anti-Semitic insensitive and blind to historic facts as the reviewer? His discontent with the movie seems to stem largely from a vague idea about who owns art but he never really explains his thesis or his position using it instead as the fulcrum of his awful ""critique."" Gee I dont know but Im guessing he himself is recompensed for his own so-called art as are his editors and publishers. And as it should be (though if I were paying singly for a review after reading this one Id be sure to put this reviewer on my do-not-buy list). So his real beef with the movie seems to be a truly ugly belief that Jews and others whose very lives and family heritages had been ripped from them should have no legal recourse. To the victor goes the spoils right? Except the Nazis ultimately were not the victors and every person who survived their unbelievably cruel persecution should have at the VERY least had their property returned to them. Im just flabbergasted that anyone with even a mediocre education could be so sadly ill-informed as this reviewer and simply floored that your editors saw fit to allow his review to be published though it is clearly based at the very least in ignorance or at worst in actual hatred. As another commenter said shame on him and shame on you. The casual and lazy anti-Semitism of the writer who saw fit to write this review and the editors who saw fit to allow its publication are at the root of why our society is still as bigoted and hateful as its ever been. You have a higher duty as the free press. I dont care if your publication is a news outlet or entertainment outlet; it enjoys a privelege and therefore carries a responsibility to its readers and its society at large. You should be ashamed. Reply Frank Farrar says June 10 2016 at 1142 am I suggest this reviewer look at all the footage of the Nazis entering Austria and the thousands upon thousands who welcomed them. Resistance was very little and fraught with danger from betrayal. Reply Alex Cranberg says February 15 2016 at 701 pm Does anyone own art? Fortunately the answer is yes and thereby artists make a living by selling their art. The Nazis had a different attitude which was that the ownership went to whoever could take it. And lets see the Soviets thought that the State should commission all art and thereby dictate its content. Are you kidding me that this Debruge guys writing is the stuff of a respected arts magazine? How appropriate that he chooses to write about art theft by suggesting the theft of more art... Reply Pat Reeder says January 31 2016 at 506 pm Watching Woman in Gold was far more interesting than reading DeBruges snooty critique. Reply Tom Foley says January 7 2016 at 900 pm My first question while reading this review was ""is the reviewer being paid by the word?"" His review is unnecessarily long and as overwrought and painfully inaccurate as he portrays the film to be. Mind you I do not think the film was a masterpiece nor is it my opinion that it is as pointless as the reviewer found it. I respect that he is simply sharing his option also. However if paid attention to it was educational entertaining and wonderfully acted while taking the usual film making liberties necessary to condense 70 years to 2 hours. Reply Chris Chris Wolfe says September 22 2015 at 233 am The movie was a wonderful experience. The reviewer is jaded lacks empathy and has some troubling notions about what occurred during WWII to Jewish people. He seems to be under the impression that the Jews while rounded up to be sent to the camp just LOST their belongings on the way or something. THAT is not what happened. They were forcibly taken from their homes. Their lives and all their belongs were stolen from them. They were raped murdered and almost genocided off the face of the planet by those Nazi maniacs. It is a matter of historical record what these people have had to endure in dealing with Austria Switzerland and Germany (and several other countries) trying to get their belongings back That anyone could be so callous as to think this movie has made too much of too little ... Well Mr. Debruge lets see what you do when YOU have everyone you know and love murdered and your belongs are stolen en masse from you. Im guessing the people treating you like youre nothing and what they did to you is meaningless WOULD make them appear to you like selfish monsters. Get that you fool? The story we watched is HARDLY the only time this has happened Its just another one of many where the people who ripped off Jewish people DUE to the Nazi horror try to get away with it AGAIN. Its not enough that these people already has suffered so very much .. .too top it off their belongings and monies are kept from them and THAT is theft .. of the worst kind. The Nazis did the dirty work and now todays Austria gets to keep the stolen goods ... why? We dont know why but I do know they should have given it to that family straight away. Honest people would have done. Reply Erica R. says August 15 2015 at 520 pm I have just watched this movie. I found the story engrossing and emotional. It told a simple story from the view point of Maria and Randy and exposed very simply the views of each side over thethe rightful home of the Klimtz paintings. In short it accomplished what it set out to do. On the contrary I found this review to be cynical jaded and callous. Reply H. Chaim Birnboim says August 5 2015 at 803 pm I saw this movie on a plane trip across the U.S. yesterday. I found it very interesting but not particularly well-acted or constructed. By contrast I found your review of it horribly insensitive to the plight the victims and horribly sensitive to the plight of the perpetrators. Just one example will suffice. ""Anti-Semitism of the time with an equally noxious caricature of modern Austrians as law-bending art-thieving monsters"". The antisemitism of the time persisted well after the post-war period. Although much abated unfortunately it continues to this day. I have close friend in Canada from whose parents living in Austria had paintings that were confiscated by the Nazis. Ten years ago (not 50 years ago) my friend and his brother did manage after much effort to overcome obstacles to get this stolen art (in the possession of an Austrian museum) returned to its rightful owners. A particularly obnoxious piece of logic in this review is the following statement ""... theres a monumental issue at stake here that the film scarcely acknowledges Does (or should) anyone really own art?"" What does this have to do with this story? This piece of art was stolen from the legal owners who were subsequently murdered. Does this reviewer believe that present-day Austrian authorities have no obligation to redress past events at least this to minimal degree? Reply Lily Rose says July 25 2015 at 750 am Mr Debruge I just saw Woman in Gold and while looking up information on the events of this film I stumbled upon your review. You sir should seriously consider another line of work....perhaps go back to school and study history..instead of trying to rewrite it. Shame on you and shame on Variety Reply Potter Novel says July 24 2015 at 636 pm I dont think the Austrian proved to be any different than the Germans. The museum knew they had stolen art and the story did an excellent job of making this point. As far as the Austrian looking bad in the movie they were for turning in the Jews at every point. Im glad the paintings are no longer in the Nazi sympathizer Museum. I just wish the others who lost art to the murdering Nazis would receive reparation to their families or to those who have no families the art should be noted that it was stolen. Reply Ann says July 13 2015 at 904 pm Ok. Nazi. Reply maf2scribe4screen says July 9 2015 at 136 pm After having seen the DVD release of ""Woman In Gold"" and reading this review from Peter Debruge it is readily apparent that his scathing review of this film could NOT be any more lacking in objective serious consideration/critiquing of its content acting direction and historical significance -- perhaps most glaringly evident by his routine misspelling of the central figure Adele Block(sic)-Bauers name in his first glossing-over reference in this very poorly edited and written review. What also really makes me question Mr. Debruges talents/skills to be a film critic is his subsequent INANE illogical reference questioning whether ""is art really owned by anyone?"" and drawing a clearly disjointed comparison to ""digital music"" rights being so routinely pirated and stolen today in Cyberspace -- some 70 years after the fall of Hitlers Nazi Germany?? Did the Nazis have some kind of ""digital rights"" in order to tear paintings from walls or cart statues off into military transports? Does any of this make any damn historical sense in comparing the different time frames of 1938 Vienna with the 21st century world of Cyberspace?? It is these innocuous and illogical type of commentary and Debruges clearly disturbed ""reverse discrimination"" allegations against ""Woman of Golds"" filmmakers that all Austrians in this historical recounting are made out to be ""two-dimensional cardboard"" characters just makes me wonder if he has ANY GRASP of history to know how many Jews were systemically looted dehumanized and SLAUGHTERED by Germans and with the readily apparent support of Adolf Hitlers fellow Austrian citizens Either Mr. Debruge is that patently IGNORANT of history or is really carefully disguised ""Holocaust Denier"" of the worst kind? For that I truly pity Mr. Debruge of knowing NOTHING or CARING THE LEAST about the kind of most depraved levels of inhumanity and cruelty dealt by the Nazis and some complicit ""occupied"" nations (lets not forget that a good number of Polish people also loaded cattle cars packed with Jews destined for Auschwitz Treblinka and other Nazi DEATH CAMPS around Europe) could ROB and LOOT the Jews and other peoples (Gypsies some Catholics Russians etc.) of their personal cherished BELONGINGS and ultimately of their LIVES at mass extermination camps Perhaps it is because Mr. Debruge and none of his own relatives suffered this type of personal loss in LIVES and cherished POSSESSIONS directly? It just boggles the mind to think there could these types of SOULLESS human beings inhabiting the earth...and in the employ of Variety as Chief International Film Critic...just mind-blowing Reply Randy Ranson says June 23 2015 at 237 am Tatiana Maslany was phenomenal and gave the kind of performance that lifted the film into any realm of believability she outperformed Helen Mirren and Helens honest shed say so herself. The only one I find hard to believe in is Ryan Reynolds the depth of his character was shallow but steady. Overall it was an interesting movie but Tatiana Maslany was the glue that held it together. Reply Vladimir Bayer says June 23 2015 at 150 am The artical is overly critical. Period. What I question is the producers motivation in telling the world yet again and again something that has been told in myriad forms already myriad times....? Reply Mari says June 18 2015 at 905 pm My aunt lived in an apartment on the Ring circle in Vienna like Maria before the war until her death a few years ago. She had a saying that the Austrians were so clever because they managed to convince the world that Hitler was not an Austrian and Beethoven was. I was reading a book by D.E. Stevenson in which she had an Austrian character say that he felt safer in England because they had a bedrock of freedom and civilization whereas in Austria civilization was just think crust. I asked my mother about that who had lived through WWII and its aftermath in what was once Austria-Hungary and she said it was quite true. Some of the Austrian people could be very barbaric once you scratch the surface civilization off. There arent many subtle films these days certainly not films like American Sniper and I think youre asking too much of this one. Certainly its not a film of evil villains like most adventure films. I think youre too harsh about the portrayal of Austrians. Of course the present day government and curators didnt want the picture removed from the Belvedere Gallery they were making a lot of money on it. The question of whether you can own art gets answered every time someone pays iTunes to download music or a show or pays money for a poster or a painting. But for Maria it wasnt about owning art it was about the picture of an aunt she dearly loved who had been stolen from her family and who was now being prostituted to make fridge magnets to profit those who had stolen her. Thats kind of an easy answer no matter what you think of the Austrians.. Reply Richard Famous says June 17 2015 at 157 pm Peter your question "" Does (or should) anyone really own art?"" makes you the winner of the award for the stupidest thing said this year by someone who is not running for the republican nomination for president -- and the year isnt even half over yet. Congratulations Reply Danny K. says June 15 2015 at 749 pm I just saw the movie today and I have to agree with Variety on this one. Something was missing from this movie. The first third of the movie was downright boring. The rest of it was gratuitous and presented gratuitous caricatures of people. And speaking of art theft that scene at the end where she is in her old home and is teleported back to her wedding was pretty much the ending scene of Titanic. I nearly expected Leonardo DeCaprio and the Titanics architect to show up and start clapping upon Helen Mirrens entry. Overall I give the movie a C maybe C+. Not awful by any means but Ive seen better. Reply Debi D says June 13 2015 at 137 pm Variety-You smell. This was an amazing well made and interesting movie. I loved it. Nothing nasty for the sale of a rating. A story well told well directed it kept my interest. I could find nothing at fault. Only 3rd time in my 58 years I give a ten out of ten. Get over yourself and your insane bling bling fake self worth when you critique a movie. It is what it is and it is good. Reply Nijole J. Salkunas says May 31 2015 at 158 am We recently went and saw the film in Melbourne Australia. We wanted to see it because we are great admirers of Gustav Klimt and we wanted to see how the subject of restitution would be handled in the film. We expected an amazing film of this extraordinary story. Helen Mirren do her best with the role she was given however she could not save the film Instead of sympathy it ended up making us angry - so over-the-topic and not very subtle in its message. Its turned us off any future films of the same genre and stories. Beating the same old drum The skins beginning to wear a bit thin. Well and truly. Reply Carole Bartolotto MA RD says June 4 2015 at 902 am Well I beg to differ with you. This was an amazing film. Your perspective is both disturbing and nonsensical. See the film. You will not regret it. It was the best I have seen so far this year. Reply Carole Bartolotto MA RD says May 30 2015 at 319 am What a terrible review. And I cannot believe he says ""Does (or should) anyone really own art?"" What?? Art is stolen from the Jews and now he brings up should anyone own art? Really????Peter Debruge has missed the point. Disregard this crummy review and see the film. Its great. Reply Lydia Lombardo Gallucci Lombardo says May 26 2015 at 529 am You and the other reviewers who panned the film have produced another KRAMER VS. KRAMER ROCKY and FATHER OF THE BRIDE mistake. The public loved these films and actually changed how they were critique later based on audience appeal. And thats whats happening to WOMAN IN GOLD. Friends are telling friends In spite of the bad reviews go see the film. I saw it yesterday and was very moved by it as were others in the audience. You missed the boat. The womans story is true and the treatment of the Jews in Austria is accurate. I have spoken first hand to people in America who were Austrians and Bavarians and they WERE NOT UPSET WHEN THE NAZIS CAME. Why because they already felt German and that this a natural and good thing. I am not Jewish but we all need to understand that it was not only the Nazis who persecuted the Jews. I am not going to give you a history lesson but it will be easy for you to trace how the Jews were led to their slaughter and Europe not only didnt care they were compliment. Reply Lydia Lombardo Gallucci Lombardo says May 26 2015 at 540 am I meant complicit. But others in their comments said it for me. The reviewer should take note not one comment agreed with his premise. Reply Peggy Hamburg says May 18 2015 at 831 am How sad that this movie has been so terribly trashed by ""professionals"" who are looking for a rare and priceless diamond and deem anything else to be a charcoal briquette. I LOVED the movie didnt feel anyone out of place or poorly portrayed. I was held captive by the quirky friendship of the Randy and Maria the bitter defeat Maria felt at having to return to Austria the perceived (or real) dislike of the Austrians toward her plight the whole 9 yards. Im glad Im not a critic and can just choose to like a movie for what it is. Reply T. Grant says May 17 2015 at 1213 am This movie had enough impact on a mysterious someone who decided to delete several scenes depicting how the Nazi doctors experimented on the prisoners. One such scene was of a woman who was strapped to a chair in a room that was infused with gas and of course it killed her. I viewed the movie twice at two theatres. The 2nd viewing was missing those scenes described above. We need to be reminded of the horrors of war because there are far too many on this planet who have no conscience no heart no love and who are ready and willing to repeat those deplorable acts on innocent people. Reply Rex Chandler says May 7 2015 at 405 pm My first time here looking at a Variety review....very disappointing. I can appreciate that everyone has their own opinion about a movie but this review seems to be a review of history and how accurate this movie was to recorded history. As a movie I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Shouldnt a movie review be about the movie? Reply manorbooks says May 5 2015 at 125 pm Maria wanted a new dishwasher not a washing machine. Get your facts straight before you start spouting off. You were wrong on so many fronts. Reply Hugo Aspinall says May 3 2015 at 1159 am This review suggests that Woman in Gold is distorting history and making both the WW2 Austrians and the Austrians who opposed Maria Altmann look too bad. This is not the case. The reviewer should watch the ""Stealing Klimt"" documentary which (according to the end credits of ""Woman in Gold"") ""inspired"" ""Woman in Gold"" to see what really happened. ""Stealing Klimt"" shows that ""Woman in Gold"" is not that far from the historical truth in fact Simon Curtis probably underplays the level of violence meted out to the Jews at the time of the Anschluss. He just hints at the menace without showing any real violence and doesnt mention that Maria Altmanns husband Fritz was sent to Dachau for a while. Reply Ani Kirschner says April 29 2015 at 551 pm Your review of the woman in Gold shows how you have no concept of what it is to lose family in this horrific way I have lost many of my family members to the Nazis and my father was a slave in a labour camp that few returned from just on the outskirts of Vienna called Mauthausen ;perhaps youd like to suggest these were nice people... your attention to details is as inaccurate as to Marias reference to her dishwasher. Clearly the story is not meaningful to you so it bores you you are insensitive clearly lacking empathy; I suggest you take a tour of Syria or other killing fields to educate yourself Reply Danny K. says June 15 2015 at 755 pm Ari I feel your pain but this is a review about a movie. The subject of the movie World War II and the Holocaust doesnt automatically make it a good move. Variety is correct on this one. It was two dimensional and it was slow. Worth the 2.25 matinee price but I wouldnt pay 11 for this one. Reply Peggy Hamburg says May 18 2015 at 837 am I cried in empathy of Gods chosen people really any people being so brutalized just because evil found a way to do so.

Reply Lev Raphael says April 29 2015 at 509 pm No it doesnt portray all Austrians as cardboard villains but it rightly shows those who are unjustly holding on to paintings that dont belong in The Belvedere as greedy and cruel. The movie isnt melodramatic-but the reviewer is. And naive too. He should try reading what Austrians have said about the hoarding of stolen art.

Reply John Green says April 24 2015 at 445 pm Peter Debruge your review of Woman in Gold which I just saw is the most pitiful and idiotic excuse for a movie review Ive ever read. It makes the amateurs perennial mistake of demanding historical veracity as though it is a documentary. Its not dont you know? Its a feature film a fiction an interesting entertainment and a captivating introduction to a story many of us know little about. The acting actors direction and production values are superb. Are you settling some scores here or simply out of your mind? Heres another of your howlers ""theres a monumental issue at stake here that the film scarcely acknowledges Does (or should) anyone really own art?"" This ""issue"" has little or nothing to do with this particular film but might be a good axe for you to grind somewhere else far away. But every paragraph of this so-called review is full of howlers. And what pray tell is a ""Chief International Film Critic""? Is it a self appointment. Are you the Chief of all film critics on the planet? Or did you have strange dreams the morning you wrote this woeful piece? Anyway better luck next time. John Green Reply Rob F says April 23 2015 at 349 am The movie was good but way over dramatized. The majority of the movie scenes never happened the way they were depicted (i.e. Marias tearful goodbye with her father before she fled Austria-her father had already died by then and her escape was even less dramatic then depicted in the movie). Read the book The Lady in Gold for a more accurate telling of this story. Reply JoAnne Braley says April 21 2015 at 642 pm I loved the movie and Debruge is a Scrooge (if that is how you pronounce his name It was edifying and entertaining not a documentary as Peter seemed to have wished. My strict unbending e-mail friend also said she would not see it because the Rape of Europa was superior (how to tell unless you watch both). My first husband was a child in Berlin during WWII and I know many of the things they said in the movie are TRUE. My nephew lives in Vienna. I was a music major and captivated by the thought of the lawyers grandfather being Schoenberg. The flash back scenes are superb as I learned in writing that our look-backs and memories are OURS and not necessarily the same as others who were there at the same time. I had tears in my eyes in many scenes especially at the airplane when the Gestapo looking for another two people. Although my father was Air Force military career my in-laws were a combination of ""fake"" Germans (Jewish) and S.S. which I didnt know until I visited there. They had the Russians shoot up their apartment and attempted rape of my mother-in-law in front of my young then husband. Helen Mirran caught the way my German relatives were very neat industrious and could make fantastic strudel. Also I was told how some would change flags for preservation of life. So dont listen to the critic. I really enjoyed as didnt know what the movie was to be about and didnt know it was true...Bravo the movie did what movies are supposed to do...transported me to another time another persons trials and happy outcome (everyone likes a happy ending...remember how they changed ""Pretty Woman?"" ) Reply Milly Kopecky says April 20 2015 at 159 pm I agree with Mike Schwager I too found the review unreasonably negative. I found the movie awesome and the characters well portrayed. Helen Mirren was at her best and Ryan Reynolds was wonderful as Randy. I sensed the reviewer must have been very young or somewhat anti-Semitic. It was as if we were to ""get over"" the past (i.e. the Holocust) and pretend the world is all sweetness and light now. It isnt and films like this bring the past into our present consciousness to remind us again to never forget. Reply Mike Schwager says April 19 2015 at 500 pm The reviewer must be anti-semitic. I found his review disgusting. My own take on the film was that it WAS a masterpiece. The portrayal by Ms. Mirren was extraordinary; and the story itself a true story about the Austrians intransigence in rightfully returning works of art to surviving Jewish families whose property was stolen outright by the Nazis and most of whose relatives were murdered by the Nazis - was told brilliantly. Having lived in Vienna in the 60s I can say that anti-semitism didnt leave that city then and undoubtedly at least in part still lingers now as in other parts of Europe. Reply Danny K. says June 15 2015 at 758 pm ^^^ Race card. Not liking a movie about the Holocaust does not make one anti-semitic. It just means the movie left a lot to be desired. And it did. Reply Frank Farrar says June 10 2016 at 1155 am Helen Mirren was mesmerizing as Mike says and stole the film in my opinion. If it had been Meryl Streep she would have won an Oscar And I prefer this film to The Monument Men. Joanne BB says April 17 2015 at 732 pm I just saw the movie and enjoyed every minute of it. The story portrays a part of history that we do not often hear about revealed one persons journey in life was interesting and well portrayed by the actors. For anyone that likes movies based on actual history this one is for them. If the portrayal of that history is not agreeable to some people - tough. It is what it is.

Reply Mike Berliner says March 30 2015 at 522 pm Not yet having seen the film I cannot comment on the aesthetics as negatively reported by Peter Deburge. But what seems particularly galling to Debruge is the films premise that art should be privately owned. Well if not by private individuals galleries and museums then by whom? The ""people"" the nation the community? That fits perfectly with the Nazis view of art it belongs to the Reich. The meaning of that is clear Art (including books films and musical compositions) are not the rightful property of their creators. And since in fact all products (art technical services etc.) are ultimately the products of individuals (and in voluntary cooperation with others) and are the products of an individuals mind and life then the only ethical/political conclusion is that ones life belongs not to oneself but to some amorphous collective and usually controlled by the government. So much for individual liberty. Reply Karen Anne says April 3 2015 at 122 pm The movie AND Helen Mirren was excrllent Please enough opinions from those who havent even seen it WTF Reply C.

This to DeBruge and only to DeBruge is the ""monumental issue at stake here..."" Could there be a more lightweight or wrongheaded critic? Reply Holly says March 24 2015 at 1004 pm I lived in Europe for many years and at times as an American Jew found it to be uncomfortable. If you read any current European newspaper you will find anti-Semitism on the rise. However during tbe time the Nazis rose to power by far the worst country was Austria in their pro-Nazi stance. For example in 1938 Austria had an estimated 198000 Jews but in 1942 only 7000 remained. So to say the Austrians werent complicit in aiding the Nazi in killing Jews is ludicrous. While you cannot blame every single Austrian for the sins of their great grandparents the Austrians atrocities are well documented. So the movie didnt appeal to you fine; but a dissertation on why Austria really didnt do anything ""bad"" during WWII isnt what I was looking for in a movie review. Reply Simon Cox says March 20 2015 at 150 pm Cant comment on the quality of the film as I havent seen it - but a family friend who was Austrian (who died recently aged 93) was a teenager there when Hitler united Austria and Germany. I remember him saying over a beer in Bern ""I recall it of course. Some of us were were poor there was no work and suddenly all us young men could join the German army and have shoes and clothes and three meals a day - so we did. We didnt even think about it us young men. As for Austria claiming they were against Hitler at all its rubbish. The Austrian people welcomed him with open arms and many agreed with his disgusting anti-Jewish policies."" So little nuance there on the national level for sure. But on the personal of course there is some nuance. The question is is this film about the national or the personal? Sounds to me like its more about the national and therefore the lack of personal nuance makes sense. But then like most here I havent seen it.

Reply Mary Rosewater says February 21 2015 at 124 pm I worked for several years writing for an art law publication about Nazi-looted and other stolen art. Having considered the topic in depth as both a lawyer and an art historian it is my opinion that people most often engage in these David and Goliath fights not for financial gain but because the restitution of these objects is the only kind of justice available to families who lost everything in the most depraved and horrific of ways. There is a metonymy involved where the objects serve as stand-ins for the actual human beings who once owned and treasured the artworks. While there are no remains and no graves of those victims in a few cases there are objects that can be traced and possibly reclaimed. It is an insufficient inchoate justice when these objects are returned but it is a kind of justice nonetheless. If this film lacks nuance perhaps that is because there is no nuance available in the telling of these stories. What could possibly be said in defense of a genocidal regime that looted not only fine art but also such prosaic items as childrens toys and pots and pans from its murdered victims? Further what could be said in defense of any person or institution that would seek to hold onto those stolen possessions? In any case whose business it is to judge whether the recovered works are ultimately sold by their rightful owners? For a family fortunate enough to win a restitution claim (and unfortunate enough to be in a position to have such a claim to begin with) the proceeds might pay for medical care or education or philanthropy. Indeed the cost alone of keeping protecting and insuring priceless art is far beyond the financial reach of an ordinary person. But really if the proceeds are used for sports cars and caviar its not my business. (Indeed any diffuse and hypothetical right that I might have to view and enjoy these artworks because art theoretically -- though not actually -- ""belongs to us all"" is so weak as to be irrelevant.) These objects are theirs and theirs alone and in all cases the claimants would trade it all if they could go back and re-write their families histories. Reply Tommi Trudeau says February 13 2015 at 1212 pm I lived with Maria Altmann for almost four years up until her death in 2011. I can tell you with absolute certainty that it was NOT about the money She sold the paintings because her legal bills were in the tens of millions of dollars. She never spent a dime of that money on herself; NOT A SINGLE DIME She insisted on wearing clothes that were over 40 years old and being driven around in her 20 year old beat up Ford Taurus with faded paint that we nicknamed the ""Klimt-mobile"". Reply Ben says February 11 2015 at 539 pm One point that i read everywhere is if its not about money then why does she sells the portrait afterward. First of all this painting always belonged to her family. It was STOLEN by the Nazi Austrian. She can do whatever she wants with that painting. You describe more the fact that there is no nuance in between the good and the bad people. Is there a way to quantify the degree of good and bad according to you? When victims were in the camps when once they were not chosen to die this day because one guard blinked an eye and sent them to another side. Do you call that Good or just act of luck because one evil person had a second where he saw a prisoner who could do some more work for them. In that case this is totally irrelevant good or bad. This is not a documentary. You cannot show to people in such a short moment than a movie that they were maybe 1% of resistant while 99% collaborated Reply See All 64 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Divorce Marks Sarah Jessica Parkers Return To HBO But...
