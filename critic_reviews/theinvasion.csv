"The Invasion reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Invasion reviewed. The Invasion reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 17 2007 415 PM Invasion of the Iraq War Metaphors Nicole Kidmans sci-fi movie gets lost in a quagmire. By Dana Stevens Nicole Kidman sees pod people in Invasion If youre going to make a movie about a lone heroine battling a worldwide epidemic of alien body-snatching Nicole Kidman is an odd choice to play the lead. I admire Kidman but not even her most ardent fan would call her the warmest of actresses. Her best performances have a chilly deliberate slightly detached quality and her beauty is precisely unearthly. Its impossible to know whats inside that perfectly modeled head or behind those icy eyes. Shes easier to picture as the victim of brainwashing from outer space than as a fierce defender of imperfect human passions. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In The Invasion (Warner Bros.) the fourth film based on Jack Finneys sci-fi novel Invasion of the Body Snatchers Kidman plays Carol Bennell a Washington D.C. psychiatrist whose longtime patient lodges a sudden complaint that her husband is not her husband.  Also suddenly--a lot of stuff in this movie happens suddenly--a space shuttle has exploded over the southern United States and Carols ex Tucker (Jeremy Northam) has resurfaced asking to see their young son. As it turns out Tucker and the patients husband are two of the earliest victims of a viral space goo that turns people into dead-eyed facsimiles of themselves bent on making the rest of the world just as soulless as they are. (Doesnt that pretty much describe Washington D.C. already?) Advertisement Carol must have recently Netflixed the far smarter 1956 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers because she takes surprisingly little time to figure out the secret of the space spores. Shes aided by Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) a scientist who specializes in rapid-fire story exposition and Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) a kind hunky doctor whom Carol likes only as a friend (more evidence that she must have been body-snatched already What flesh-and-blood earthling isnt attracted to Daniel Craig?). Having permitted her son to spend the weekend with his father Carol now has two tasks before her She must find her little boy before hes brain-napped by Dad and then smuggle him to safety while Galeanos medical team races to invent an antidote. Along the way she will make many tough moral choices practically none of which will make any sense. The Invasion tries to update the political relevance of the first film (which treated the body-snatching threat as an allegory for McCarthyism and postwar conformity) with a constant stream of cable-news chatter about the war in Iraq. But in addition to ringing false--did we go to war in Iraq because were mindless conformists or because we were fed bad information?--these parallels clash with the movies ham-handed humanist message. If (as expounded at length here by Roger Rees playing a cynical Russian diplomat) its our predilection to defend our selfish interests that makes us truly human then shouldnt the peaceful advance of the body-snatched herd be regarded as a good thing? If like Kidmans character we struggle mightily against the onslaught of the pod people are we then affirming chaos and violence including the violence of the current war as our inevitable lot? Luckily all of this philosophizing is too clunky to stick with you much past the parking lot. The films German director Oliver Hirschbiegel is best known for Downfall a claustrophobic melodrama about Hitlers last days in an underground bunker. After he completed The Invasion the Wachowski brothers of Matrix fame were brought in to juice it up with some action scenes and the graft is very visible. A late chase scene contains some striking images including a speeding car completely covered with writhing body-snatchers but it feels like a lift from a George Romero film. The Invasion functions just well enough to accomplish the poor mans version of suspense It makes you jump when scary things pop out of dark corners and go ""ew"" when the snatchers spread the virus by their favorite method--barfing on the victims face. But it falls far short as an effective sci-fi thriller not to mention the brainy political allegory its determined to be. Correction Aug. 17 This piece originally called The Invasion the third movie based on Jack Finneys novel. It is the fourth. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)

"War good movie bad | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWar good movie badHeres a helpful suggestion for the entertainment committee at next summers Republican Party convention. How about a screening of The Invasion on opening night?By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 17 2007 (out of 4)Starring Nicole Kidman Daniel Craig Jeremy Northam Jeffrey Wright and Jackson Bond. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. 93 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Article Continued Below Heres a helpful suggestion for the entertainment committee at next summers Republican Party convention. How about a screening of The Invasion on opening night?You could hardly ask for a better illustration of the essential Republican message that war is good for humanity and proof of compassion facts only godless zombies and passionless peaceniks would dispute. There wouldnt be a dry eye in the house as conventioneers realize that finally - finally - someone in Hollywood had listened to reason. They might even get stars Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig to walk the red-state carpet.Granted the hilariously awful The Invasion likely isnt intended as balm for the Bush Administration but whos to say what its mission really is? As the fourth and infinitely worst movie adaptation of Jack Finneys classic 1955 novel about space alien squatters best known as Invasion of the Body Snatchers the film itself is a victim of abduction.Credited director Oliver Hirschbiegel (Downfall) was reportedly booted by producer Joel Silver late into the production after test screenings returned bothersome results. Hirschbiegel was replaced by the uncredited James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) hand-picked by Silvers proteges the Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix) who proceeded to reshoot scenes and to pump up the action.Hirschbiegel wanted a thoughtful picture one that drew provocative parallels between 1950s Red Menace fear mongering and todays ""War on Terror"" triumphalism. Finneys main argument was the necessity of independent thinking not promoting ideologies of either the left or the right.Such art-house niceties have been stripped from The Invasion which is what you get when you have a very good cast following a lobotomized script (newcomer David Kajganich is to blame) and rudderless direction.The movie retains the basic story of alien spores landing on Earth which proceed to infect and occupy humans and to turn them into unsmiling automatons. Kidman plays Carol Bennell a Washington D.C. psychiatrist who is obliged to sprint in high heels to free us her cute son Oliver (Jackson Bond) and her wannabe lover Ben (Daniel Craig) from slimy intergalactic occupiers.Thats because Bennells aloof ex-hubby Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam) is being a bigger pain than usual. As a top disease specialist hes amongst the first to be infected by the alien spores which arrive in the debris of a wrecked space shuttle. Hes also in the best position to spread the infection which is most effectively achieved via projectile vomiting from one mouth to another (Im not making this up). The alien presence takes root when the victim next goes to sleep using the REM phase to launch itself. People awake to find themselves covered in slime and converted to surrender monkeys unwilling to wage holy war of any kind. They are no longer themselves as horrified spouses attest.This is plainly un-American as TV broadcasts reveal. All across the globe as the aliens assume human form tanks rolls to a halt suicide bombers gather flowers and antagonists turn into pacifists. Imagine how terrible this would beTheres real potential for this premise either as cautionary parable or wicked parody especially when you recall Kidmans recent work in The Stepford Wives in which she played a different kind of automaton. But The Invasion squanders its abundance of resources by reducing it all to just another moronic chase thriller - especially in the tacked-on finale involving a flaming car and a helicopter. Kidman careers from one scrape to another dodging advancing aliens and the impending sleep that could change her into one of them. Co-stars Craig and Northam lurch in and out of the frame bad editing being another of this pictures problems. Most laughable of all is the underwritten role assigned Jeffrey Wright a research scientist and insane optimist who seems to have lost his mind long before the aliens arrived.Theres no telling how The Invasion might have turned out had director Hirschbiegel been allowed to pursue his artistic vision. Theres a hint of lost complexity in an early speech by a Russian diplomat about how ""civilization is an illusion"" and that anyone is capable of violence under certain circumstances. Well have to wait until the inevitable directors cut DVD to find out what Hirschbiegel really wanted to say. It would have to be a whole lot more interesting than this accidental agit-prop which equates pacifism with mindlessness.

Starring Nicole Kidman Daniel Craig Jeffrey Wright and Jeremy Northam. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Invasion"" is the fourth version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and before seeing it anyone should be excused for wondering ""Does the world need another?"" The answer strangely enough is yes. Though by now ""pod people"" has become a catchphrase and the whole notion is almost a cliche there is something about this story that speaks to the experience of life. When Nicole Kidman walks down a crowded street expressionless and emotionless pretending to be one of the aliens we know what shes going through because weve done it. Probably yesterday. Likewise we know the dread of the hostile group and we all know what its like to look at people and realize theyre not really there that they havent been there for a while. ""The Invasion"" connects on a gut level in two ways political and existential. In political terms its a metaphor for how all societies periodically go crazy surrender their discernment for groupthink and behave in cruel ways. In existential terms its a frightening reminder of the true nature of life which we frantically try to gloss over with everything we do say and create Were alone. ""The Invasion"" like all versions of this tale speaks to the human fear of utter and complete isolation. But the movie doesnt coast on the work of previous versions. Screenwriter Dave Kajganich completely reimagines the story including the nature of the pods. In ""The Invasion"" the pods are an alien virus that comes to Earth when a space shuttle explodes upon re-entering the atmosphere. The pieces of the shuttle spread out over miles carry the virus and soon as more people come into contact with the fragments and with those whose blood has been infected folks start acting weird emotionless placid and disengaged. The story shrewdly places the main characters where they need to be. Kidman is Carol a psychiatrist and so shes up on the behavioral changes. Her best friend Ben (Daniel Craig) is a physician and medical researcher so hes able to find out whats going on medically. And Carols ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) who is one of the first to be infected is at the Centers for Disease Control. Needless to say having been infected he does everything he can to spread the disease. Like all cultists the pod people are alarming not because theyre happy being pod people but because they insist that everyone should become a pod person. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel fills the screen with frightening images of group madness. In one scene our heroine tries to escape with her son and finds her car covered in a swarm of bodies - about 40 people trying to break in and convert them. At the same time ""The Invasion"" adds a note of ambiguity about the nature of these aliens which doesnt confuse the film but rather adds to its richness and complexity The pod people live in a world of placidity and mutual harmony. If everyone were like them there would be no war and violence - except against those people immune to the virus. In ""The Invasion"" Kidman has to do a few things. She has to seem a worthy focus for our sympathetic interest. She has to become someone wed not like to see become a pod. And she has to look scared out of her mind. All three things are a lot easier than playing Virginia Woolf and she hits them out of the park. Kidman makes the case for flawed and emotional humanity by just standing there. As the best friend Craig shows that hes not turned into a James Bond pod always a danger after a career-transforming role and Jeffrey Wright as the researcher who figures out the nature of the virus again demonstrates that hes one of the finest character actors around. Its hard to say what makes Wright so special or so interesting except that though the roles change an impression of alert intelligence and integrity remain consistent. He doesnt call attention to himself but then he doesnt need to. -- Advisory Disturbing images and strong language.

Friday August 17 2007 400 AM The Invasion Sci-fi thriller in which an alien virus turnshumans into emotionless zombies. With Nicole Kidman Jeremy Northam Daniel Craig. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel (136).PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. One of the first inadvertent laughs one gets from Oliver Hirschbiegels godawful ""The Invasion"" comes when the psychiatrist played by Nicole Kidman steps out of a cab in Washington D.C. and notes that most of the people on the street have dead expressions on their faces. You know what she has to be thinking ""What is this a scene out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers?"" Thats what anyone whos seen one of three earlier movies adapted from Jack Finneys classic 1955 sci-fi novel would think. The other body-snatching movies include 1978 and 1993 versions of Finneys work by Philip Kaufman and Abel Ferrara but the idea of soulless human replicants first became indelible in Don Siegels 1956 film. But here Kidmans Dr. Carol Ben-nell moves on putting off her suspicions until later after leaving her young son with strange-acting ex-hus-band Tucker (Jeremy Northam). Her ex is one of the first humans infected by an alien supervirus brought to Earth by chunks of the Columbia shuttle that disintegrated over Texas in 2003. Exploiting that tragedy for a commercial movie is bad enough but obliterating the original structure and intent of ""Body Snatchers"" is cinema-lit blasphemy. While Finneys book and its first three movie adaptations used the alien invasion of humans as allegories about contemporary social and political issues ""Invasion"" is a simple chase film with Kidmans Dr. Carol Bennell trying to rescue son Oliver (Jackson Bond) while her boyfriend Ben (Daniel Craig) and lab wiz Dr. Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) search for an instant cure. I suppose the new film may be playing on our fear of Asian or bird flu. But it is so comically bad I was hoping that Dr. Bennells generous dispensing of anti-depressants was sort of a conciliatory nod from Kidman to her Scientologist ex-husband Tom Cruise. After all as the infected bodies take over the world they look and act like Cruises dark fantasy of Prozac zombies. But there is nothing here to be taken seriously let alone fear. The movie doesnt even have those creepy pods in which humans are replicated. The virus is simply passed on through the vomit of the infected. Yep they just barf in their victims faces.

Daniel Craig stars as Ben a doctor who tries to help Carol played by Nicole Kidman in The Invasion. Photo Peter Sorel The Invasion 1 / 2 Back to Gallery IN her post-Tom Cruise career ascent Nicole Kidman was bound to take tumbles and The Invasion is one. Then again not even James Bond can save this low-tech War of the Worlds in which Daniel Craig dawdles as a doctor and Kidmans love interest. Sometimes sheer star power isnt enough as evidenced by costly reshoots spurred by poor test screenings. What did director Oliver Hirschbiegel fear most? Comment cards. This fourth film of a tale born in the 50s subverts that eras blacklisting and Cold War paranoia by suggesting all is well on a planet rocked by terrorist threats and arms buildups. After all at least were still human. A bad thing would be absorbing rogue interstellar DNA from a crashed space shuttle and becoming calmly cooperative peaceniks -- I guess. Invasions takeover is so sudden and widespread that it skips past the eerie unease of dawning fear -- previous editions best parts -- and puts the pedal to the mettle of freakout action with fiery car chases blazing gunfire and frantic escapes as Kidman seeks her son and succor. Yet the aliens domination is so swift and sweeping that her defiance seems hopeless. Resistance is futile -- unless your screenplay can offer pat absurd plot turns. Even 1978s best-of-the-bunch Invasion of the Body Snatchers had moments of macabre mirth but this spin is as chuckle-challenged as the poker-faced automotons that humans become when taken over. And how does that happen? Not with seedlike pods as bedfore. For the iPod-era alien DNA is spread by projectile vomiting. Then when you fall asleep you grow and shed a sticky skin and become a drone with no free will. Of course try falling asleep with vomit on you. Thanks for small favors. At least some homage is paid to Invasions ancestors notably by casting the 78 films Veronica Cartwright as one of Kidmans psychiatric patients. When her husband turns even more soulless Cartwright cranks up crying hysteria as only she can do -- bless her. Kidmans kid also is a winner as bravely and sweetly played by Bond -- Jackson Bond. He even keeps a straight face when alienated humans act like clueless Coneheads ditching contractions and masking their impassiveness with forced pleasantries. ""We are from France."" But even after adrenaline-drenched reshoots by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and The Matrixs Wachowski brothers (Andy and Larry) this movies a mess with awkward flash-forwards and gotcha flashiness for a concept whose sneaking needed no tweaking.

Theyre built for it. Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars At a Czech-hosted dinner party of bantering colleagues a Russian diplomat turns to Washington D.C. psychiatrist Carol Bennell and begins one of the few interesting riffs in ""The Invasion"" starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. In heavily accented English Yorish (Roger Rees) scolds Kidmans Carol about the primal nature of man and the conflicts bedeviling the globe. Humankind is hardly kind. And Americans in particular are incapable of finding peace without taking little pills for what ails us he says pointedly. The constant chatter coming from newscasts only supports his arguments. We are a world in a perpetual state of war. Theres something mildly inspired in having this set-piece tease the conflict many critics thought author Jack Finney was addressing in his 1955 sci-fi novel ""The Body Snatchers"" in the first place - the Cold War. Unfortunately its power is fleeting like a number of promising moments in German director Oliver Hirschbiegels middling and muddled return to Finneys thriller about citizens overtaken by an alien seed. As they sleep theyre transformed into emotionless versions of themselves. The uninfected begin to seem psychotic as their numbers dwindle but their well-founded paranoia about loved ones takes root. My husband is not my husband. My wife is not my wife. Or in the case of the good doctor Bennell my secretary is not my secretary. Set in the present the movie gets underway when a space shuttle crashes. The Patriot has strewn debris from Dallas to D.C. That phrase - from Dallas to D.C - is repeated enough to draw a far-from-subtle connection between our sitting president (whom we see in various newscasts playing in the background) and disaster. Carols ex-husband. Tucker a government honcho visits a wreckage site. He learns that the shuttle brought back some type of spore. People have been warned not to touch the debris. But this doesnt stop a young girl from handing Tucker (Jeremy Northam) a piece. That quickly hes infected. And soon the U.S. government and the media are floating story after story about a flu epidemic and a national move toward innoculation a plan to speed up the takeover of the title. Dogs - our friends our sentinels our babies - recognize the imposters. Though why they snarl instead of urinate given the plantlike origins of the invaders goes unexplained. ""The Invasion"" has a frustratingly arrhythmic beat. Its not the effects-laden action that suffers from this herky-jerkiness. Its the human ties. One wishes for more from the pairing of Kidman and Craig moonlighting here as friend and suitor Ben Driscoll. The filmmakers (and rumor has it there were more than those credited) cant seem to decide whether audiences know the novel and the movies previous incarnations. Of course if youre familiar with the earlier films ""The Invasion"" is even less satisfying. Don Siegels 1956 B-movie- style thriller and Philip Kaufmans 1978 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" starring Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams remain the best. As cheesy as the original looks today something in Mill Valleys Dr. Matthew Bennell and Becky Driscolls relationships - to each other to their friends and their neighbors - still feels tragically vulnerable. And even with its slightly dated critique of 70s psychobabble Kaufman and screenwriter W.D. Richter made sure authentic bonds were at stake. In casting Kidman as a protective mom and putting her characters son Oliver at risk ""The Invasion"" should rattle just as many nerves. It doesnt - even with more advanced horror effects. Which poses this question Can a movie be all adrenaline and still have no rush? Young Jackson Bond delivers a loving smart believable Oliver. Hes the movies surprising light. But there are a couple of other beacons in the murk. Jeffrey Wright plays scientist and friend Steven Galeano. Veronica Cartwright (wonderful in the Kaufman movie) plays one of Bennells patients. The wife of a emotionally abusive man she recognizes a larger disaster in his new conciliatory manner. My husband is not my husband indeed.

"Creative compromises are the real enemy in Invasion - The Boston Globe Lifted Up (1985) | Passion Pit Listen Live Boston.com HomeTodays GlobeNewsYour TownBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal Estate Movies Restaurants Music Theater/Art Television Celebrity news Events Games Comics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Creative compromises are the real enemy in Invasion By Ty Burr Globe Staff / August 17 2007 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Buried somewhere within the bipolar extravaganza that is The Invasion is an awfully good movie that got away.The Nicole Kidman thriller is the fourth film version of the alien-paranoia classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers -- previously filmed in 1956 1978 and 1993 -- and to understand its problems you have to know some Hollywood back story.Written by hot young screenwriter David Kajganich and directed by German filmmaker Oliver Hirschbiegel (who made the 2004 Hitlers-last-days movie Downfall) The Invasion was filmed in 2005. Producer Joel Silver that purveyor of commercially successful wham-bam decided Hirschbiegels cut didnt work and put it on the shelf for a year ultimately bringing in the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix) to dream up some action scenes and James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) to reshoot them last fall.Memo to Silver This never works. It never has. Get it through your head -- trusting the original vision is always the better idea. As an example of creative (or desperate) editing meant to salvage a compromised project The Invasion is a fascinating object lesson. As a sci-fi thriller sadly its a mess.From what I can tell Hirschbiegel and Kajganichs original had two great notions. The first is that Kidman already seems like an alien replicant. The Invasion is set in Washington D.C. where Dr. Carol Bennell (Kidman) is a psychiatrist and single mom with a young son named Oliver (Jackson Bond). The action kicks in seconds after the opening credits with the unexpected crash landing of the space shuttle bearing alien spores. Within hours -- or days or weeks; its hard to tell -- people start behaving oddly emotionlessly. Theyre no longer who they were but part of an eerie hive mind.The gimmick is that Kidmans heroine starts the film as a cool maternal zombie -- never has the actress more resembled a porcelain doll -- only to fall apart and become a stressed-out human as the virus takes root in the population. She has to lose control to remember she has a soul. There are no pods this time; as Carols ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) demonstrates the spores are passed from person to person in an icky spew of green bile. Then you go to sleep your DNA is re-engineered and you wake up part of an alien ant colony.The movies other brilliantly perverse idea This might not be such a bad thing. In shards of overheard news footage we realize that peace is breaking out all over the planet Iraq Israel North Korea. Why fight when were all one big organism anyway? Is individuality a fair trade for global harmony? As The Invasion hurtles forward fraying at the seams the audience is put in the extremely odd position of rooting for both the humans and the aliens. Thats the intent. At least I think it is. There are two movies here and the more simplistic one ends up in charge. Carols friend and brooding love interest a doctor named Ben (Daniel Craig) gets a fair amount of business but other characters have been thwacked back to brief appearances Josef Sommer and Celia Weston get one good scene as Bens aging Eastern European friends the Belicecs as does Roger Rees playing a cynical Russian diplomat. The gifted Jeffrey Wright is handed chunks of exposition as a lab researcher then hustled off-screen.Also present is Veronica Cartwright -- nice to know she survived the 1978 version -- as one of Carols patients. Her failure to go alien on schedule tilts The Invasion into an increasingly preposterous final 30 minutes where characters hastily theorize about immunities and embark on long frenetic car chases. The spectacularly eerie vibe the earlier scenes have built up almost in spite of themselves dies in a din of crushed fenders and gunshots. The films rewritten ending is -- theres no other word for it -- pathetic a laughable attempt to patch closure onto a nightmare. Is there irony intended? Are we supposed to mourn the serene dull alien Earth that almost is? By now the storytellings much too confused to tell.In the way that certain baseball games become pitchers duels some movies are cutting-room battles. The credited editors on The Invasion are Hans Funck and Joel Negron; the first cut Downfall the second movies like Man of the House and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning. One is Hirschbiegels man the other Joel Silvers. At times you can actually see their two versions of the film wrestling as scenes leap forward in time and then suddenly jump back.At other moments you sense the stately almost monochromatic dread of Funcks cut between the sutures of meat-and-potatoes suspense the nip-and-tuck of the hired plastic surgeon. Who knows what this movie could have been? The Invasion died on the operating-room table and were just watching the wake.Ty Burr can be reached at tburr%globe.com.

The cause of Daniels immediate distress is obvious -- its the day of his fathers funeral and here is the undertaker with the wrong corpse. ""Wrong"" is the operative word with ""Death at a Funeral"" which in the first very funny 30 minutes shows its hand and then unfortunately continues to wave that hand frantically for the next hour. In one of the movies few successful running jokes the wrong fellow -- would-be writer Daniel -- is slated to deliver the eulogy. Really shouldnt it be his brother Robert (Rupert Graves) a self-centered best-selling novelist? A niece of the deceased gives her fiance what she thinks is a Valium to blunt his panic at meeting the clan; in fact the pill is a powerful hallucinogenic. Worst of all a mysterious guest (Peter Dinklage) threatens to besmirch the reputation and memory of the deceased (and couldnt the screenwriter have come up with a better fresher scandal?) unless his terms are met. Ah if only blackmail were the worst of this interlopers offenses. ""I tried writing once"" he observes after checking out a few pages of Daniels novel-in-progress. ""It didnt work for me either."" ENLARGE There is throughout much locking and slamming of doors broad physical humor ever-escalating skirmishes between family members and this being England plenty of bathroom humor. But whatever head of steam ""Death at a Funeral"" gathers is dissipated by the repetitive predictable jokes and by the cowardice of its sugary ending. Superbad Gross-out jokes the rat-a-tat spewing of obscenities and the ever-so-colorful expressions that describe certain secondary sexual characteristics and certain intimate acts -- theyre the high octane fueling contemporary comedies aimed at adolescent boys. But sweetness? Not so much. Which brings us to the subject of the wonderful ""Superbad"" a movie that shares its bawdy big-hearted DNA with ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) -- the characters are named for ""Superbad"" screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg -- are lifelong boon companions and state-of-the-art nerds who are about to graduate from high school and go their separate ways. The skinny gentle and socially inept Evan who has worn a deep groove in the straight and narrow is headed for Dartmouth; the economy-sized potty-mouthed Seth is headed for oblivion. An unexpected invitation to a party at the house of cool girl Jules (Emma Stone) gets Seth and Evan fantasizing -- maybe theyll get drunk maybe theyll get lucky -- and sets off a chain of events that tests their alcohol tolerance and their relationship. A hilarious -- if slightly protracted -- intersecting plot involves the boys super-twerp friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse in a terrific debut) and a couple of policemen (Mr. Rogen and Bill Hader) with a very elastic interpretation of civic responsibility. The business about the fake I.D. -- funny; the liquor store holdup -- very very funny; the tutorial on fooling the Breathalyzer -- funnier still. But whats most memorable most striking about ""Superbad"" is the canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity. The Invasion Look at them the residents of Washington D.C. moving down the street like sleepwalkers. Civil servants beaten down by the bureaucracy? Elected officials worn down by Senate probes and the 24-hour news cycle? If only. At the beginning of ""The Invasion"" the uninspired fourth version of the 1956 sci-fi classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" a space shuttle explodes sprinkling wreckage almost the length of the U.S. That detritus carries a peculiar payload -- a clear malleable substance able to survive the extreme chill of space and the flaring heat of re-entry. Those who come into contact with it suddenly dont seem like themselves. Beltway psychiatrist and divorcee Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman whos been given the same last name as the doctor in ""Body Snatchers"") simply reaches for a prescription pad when a longtime patient hysterically insists that her husband is an impostor. He looks like the man she married but hes so well calm so free of emotion. Then Carol takes a hard look at the affectless citizenry waiting at the bus stops walking alongside her takes note of the odd substance hanging off a piece of the candy her son Oliver (the very good Jackson Bond) brings home on Halloween. Officials attribute the symptoms to a new strain of flu but Carol is unconvinced sharing her concerns with fellow doctor and sometime date Ben (Daniel Craig). Under the circumstances maybe it wasnt such a smart idea for her to let Oliver spend the weekend with his dad whos got a lofty position at the Centers for Disease Control and was one of the first responders when the shuttle crashed. What helped give the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" its nightmare creepiness -- the movie has lost no power to haunt -- was the low-key low-tech feel. The small-town setting made the story all the more personal and immediate; it unfolded coolly and inexorably. Except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway there is nothing understated about ""The Invasion."" With all the shoot-outs the screaming the chases collisions and fireballs there isnt much time for storytelling (unless you count the piffle spouted during a dinner-party scene thats meant to illuminate the movies theme) very little time devoted to the search for an antidote to the bizarre ailment (its found with comic speed) and next to no time for the resolution. In any case the sound and fury will keep audiences wide awake and thats a good thing. When aliens invade nodding off can be a risky business. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

As alien spore brought to Earth via a crashed Space Shuttle works its viral way through the populace people become indifferent emotionless - walking down the street oblivious to the poverty homelessness and crime all around them. Its like theyve been enveloped in their own little worlds as if they are . . . yes plugged into iPods. Theyve become iPod people But while Hirschbiegel - making his English-language debut after gaining Hollywoods attention with Downfall his adrenalized take on the final furious days of Adolf Hitler - works in some Apple product placement (Kidman uses an iBook) there are no iPods. Worse yet there are no pods. Fans of Don Siegels 1956 original Philip Kaufmans 1978 re-do and Abel Ferraras 1994 Body Snatchers should gird themselves as the extraterrestrial virus spreads across the land warping the DNA of slumbering masses all that happens is that the infected get clammy and icky bits of gelatinous goo cling to their skin. Then they wake up take a shower and go about their business a crowd of soulless conformists doing the work and buying the stuff that makes the country hum. If The Invasion is about anything other than jumpy chases rampant paranoia and projectile vomiting (thats how the organism is transmitted) its about personal freedom versus social control and government/corporate guardianship. Thats a big amorphous ""about"" - kind of what The Bourne Ultimatum touches on between its jumpy chase sequences and rampant paranoia. (The two films also share a breaking-into-a-pharmacy opening scene.) But The Invasion is mostly about delivering thrills and chills and this it does with moderate success and a bunch of fast no-nonsense edits. As Carol Bennell a Washington psychiatrist Kidman speaks softly carries a big prescription pad and relishes her time with her cute little son (Jackson Bond). Dad (Jeremy Northam) a government disease-control honcho has moved out - the exes are haggling over visitation rights and its no surprise that one of the first of the movies players to come down with this insistent new ""flu"" strain is the slick sinister former spouse. But will handsome and resourceful colleague Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) manage to stave off infection to help Carol? And what about that tech-talking immunologist played by the ever-cool Jeffrey Wright? Actually with its ironic references to the war in Iraq (U.S. troops pull out) and a chummy agreement between President Bush and Venezuelan lefty despot Hugo Chavez The Invasion seems to suggest that if we all just zoned out on Zoloft there would be an end to war to conflict to criminals. But then there might also be an end to movies about plucky heroes - and plucky heroines - fleeing from threatening mobs and dark conspiracies overcoming their own fears and custody battles to save their kid and save the world.

What is Nicole Kidman doing in this movie? Movie review Showtimes""The Invasion"" with Nicole Kidman Daniel Craig and Jeremy Northam. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel from a screenplay by David Kajganich. 93 minutes. Rated R for language. Several theaters. lt;As invasions go this ones a Bay of Pigs. Its not enough to say that the newest in the lineage of 1956s ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" -- which includes the great 1978 remake and Abel Ferraras respectable 1993 ""Body Snatchers"" -- got the recessive gene. Its such a laughable scareless train wreck that you dont need to know the disastrous insider-baseball behind its production to hate it. The beginning is familiar Alien spores come to Earth -- this time via an exploded space shuttle; filmmakers better hope the damaged one currently in orbit doesnt go boom -- and turns humans into automatons. ""My husband is not my husband"" a patient (1978 vet Veronica Cartwright) complains to her psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman). Neither is Bennells own husband -- well her ex a CDC man (Jeremy Northam) who was one of the first transformed. Absent for years now he wants their little boy (Jackson Bond) for the weekend. His robotic delivery and movements -- more Conehead than pod -- drew laughs from the audience I was in. But there are no pods in this version. The changed people infect others by ... wait for it ... throwing up in their faces. So instead of Pod-People we have Puke-People. And several chases in which victims are running from pursuers who want to catch them and vomit in their faces. A scene in which a late-night ""census-taker"" (Uh land-shark) dry-heaves at Bennell through a cracked door is funny enough. But an attack aboard a subway comes off more like the group-barfing scene in ""Stand By Me"" than anything horrific. As the Puke-People begin to take over Bennell must look emotionless (not hard with the cosmetic work Kidmans apparently had) to avoid detection and enlist her smitten doctor pal (new Bond Daniel Craig) to help rescue the boy -- who may hold the key to humanitys survival. The movie was reportedly yanked from director Oliver Hirschbiegel (see his riveting ""Das Experiment"") and given to the Wachowski brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy) who rewrote nearly a third of it and had their ""V for Vendetta"" director James McTeigue do reshoots. So it was once even worse? Whoevers responsible time-disjointing editing at key points is ineffective and confusing. The quickly transformed world -- where India and Pakistan immediately disarm the Iraq occupation abruptly stops and Bush takes a long shower with Chavez -- looks pretty good. (While the original was a Red Scare allegory this one weakly tries and badly fails with some sort of medication reference. Attention Paxil folks.) And the unbelievably lame lazy seemingly improvised wrap-up is cheaper than any I can remember from a 50s B-flick. The good news is there was no pod under my seat. Because Im sure I nodded off.

But wait - whats that icky stuff clinging to the wreckage? Could it be microspores intent on turning humans into a race of zombies?""The Invasion"" is yet another adaptation of Jack Finneys classic 1955 science fiction novel ""The Body Snatchers."" After Don Siegels 1956 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Phil Kaufmans equally classic 1978 remake this new mutation has a lot to live up to. The filmmakers probably felt the same way To distance themselves from the competition theyve shortened the title. Maybe the next director to rework this material will call his film ""The.""In this go-round the chief non-pod protagonist is Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) a Washington D.C. psychiatrist whose estranged husband Tucker (Jeremy Northam) just happens to be a top level official with the Centers For Disease Control. He also was one of the first investigators at the crash site and got slimed by that sticky stuff. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Tucker has been something of a deadbeat dad to his young son Oliver (Jackson Bond) but suddenly he wants to help the boy. To Carol this turn of events is almost as unnerving as Tuckers newfound Zen calm. At the same time one of her patients (Veronica Cartwright) tearfully confesses that her bullying husband has changed overnight into a placid stranger. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Instead of initiating group therapy sessions for women whose husbands have turned into zombies Carol turns to her doctor friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) who doesnt buy the official line that whats going around is just a new form of flu. Squinting through his microscope Bens colleague Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) confirms the worst ""One things for sure - it aint from around here.""You may have noticed that the acting talent is top drawer. (For good measure Roger Rees shows up playing - what else? - a Russian ambassador.) The director Oliver Hirschbiegel made the excellent ""Downfall"" the Hitler-in-a-bunker opus that was like a high-art zombie picture.You may also have noticed that ""The Invasion"" which has been gathering dust on the shelf and was completed before ""Casino Royale"" is being released in August - a dead zone for major studio movies. (Reportedly the Wachowski brothers did some uncredited reshoots.)How bad is it? Bad enough - and yet this source material has such a high creep quotient that on some level it still scares. The 1956 version was wildly interpreted by Deep Thinkers as a metaphor for the McCarthyite Red Scare and the 1978 version was a Vietnam/Watergate metaphor although setting the pod people scenario in San Francisco at the height of the human-potential movement was a satirical masterstroke.In ""The Invasion"" we are constantly bombarded with TV news flashes about warfare in Iraq Kabul Darfur. As the Snatchers take over the news becomes happier - Iraq is cleaned up George W. Bush and Hugo Chavez reach an oil accord crime is down everywhere. Being a pod person even though they seem more menacing here than their peacenik reputation warrants has its advantages.In fact the pro-pod arguments that Tucker and the others offer up to Carol are so persuasive that you wonder why she doesnt enlist. Is it because as a rule - though less so here - Kidmans acting is already a bit pod-like?But Carol who attempts to flee with Oliver to safety is an old-fashioned heroine. At times ""The Invasion"" comes across as a mishmash of ""Rosemarys Baby"" and ""The Stepford Wives."" (Kidman starred in the remake of that one too.) The films message is straightforward Better the derangements of humanity than the blandness of zombiedom. Fatherhood may come in for a trouncing in ""The Invasion"" but motherhood survives intact. Grade C Rated PG-13 for violence disturbing images and terror.

"Invasion The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; invasion-the ) Invasion The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Based on the evidence at hand its impossible to say whether director Oliver Hirschbiegels (Downfall) original cut of The Invasion would have been any good. What can be said is that the mismatched blending of Hirschbiegels low-key horror and the Wachowski Brothers anything-but-low-key action sequences results in a cinematic dud. The Invasion doesnt know what it wants to be - an action film a horror movie a science fiction allegory a mother/son bonding picture - and  as a result it ends up being none of the above. After an atmospheric and well-paced first two reels the movie loses coherence as it rushes through potentially slower sequences to get to the pyrotechnic payoffs that result in an abrupt unsatisfying conclusion. This is the fourth screen adaptation of Jack Finneys The Body Snatchers. The strong beginning promises an effective re-imagination of the Cold War tale but the film never delivers. As the tone vacillates between creepiness and mayhem we begin to wonder if the movie has a split personality. Poor test screenings caused Hirschbiegels final cut to be scrapped. The Wachowski Brothers and their (uncredited) hand-picked director James McTeigue were brought in to do substantive re-shoots designed to position the film less as an ""art house"" offering and more as ""mainstream"" fare. The new sequences are so awkwardly incorporated that they couldnt be more obvious if a neon sign was displayed above them. Hirschbiegels material is moody; it inspires unease. McTeigues is over-the-top and ridiculous; it inspires either contempt or laughter (depending on your mood). There may be a good movie in there somewhere but its not the one I saw projected on the screen. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) is a divorced psychiatrist who is upset about being parted from her son Oliver (Jackson Bond) when he goes to spend time with his dad Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam). Her (platonic) best friend Ben (Daniel Craig) tells her not to worry but Carols unease is well founded. It seems that Tucker has been taken over by an alien species and his 1 goal is to make everyone like him. It doesnt take long before humans are being converted en masse and the transformation happens easily all it takes is being sneezed or spat on by someone already infected followed by a good nights sleep. The government is calling the epidemic a ""flu"" and is setting up ""vaccine centers"" - but those with inside knowledge like Carol recognize that the only way to avoid contamination is to stay awake. The infection takes control during the REM phase of sleep and those who succumb to slumber will no longer be themselves when they awaken. Most of the movie consists of Carol searching for her son and once finding him trying to keep him from the aliens clutches. This results in a lot of running around that climaxes with an idiotic car chase in which Carols burning car is guided to its destination by a helicopter. This sequence might not seem out of place in a Die Hard movie but its incorporation in The Invasion is a miscalculation that singlehandedly torpedoes the films final quarter. The movie has other problems - most notably the way significant exposition and transition scenes have been eliminated - but this is one it cannot overcome. Fans of Nicole Kidmans acting will be disappointed. Despite a lot of screen time she doesnt do much. Shes mainly on hand to look good (as in an early shot where shes dressed in a sheer white tee-shirt) while playing the damsel-in-distress turned mother-protector. The role is physical but not challenging. One assumes that had Daniel Craig been offered this part after winning the 007 sweepstakes he would not have taken it. The word ""thankless"" comes to mind although Craigs limited involvement doesnt come close to the way Jeffrey Wright (as a scientist investigating the epidemic) is underused. The film tries to pay homage to one of its predecessors by giving a small role to Veronica Cartwright (one of the leads in 1978s Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Jack Finneys source material was a thinly veiled commentary about the Red Scare (not unlike Arthur Millers The Crucible). For The Invasion an attempt is made to tie the body snatchers work into a myriad of real-life current events mistrust of government the situation in Iraq and the fear of a worldwide medicine-resistant pandemic. Its done sloppily and haphazardly however. In the end allegorical aspirations have been shunted into the background by the need to enhance the films action quotient. Likewise the pyrotechnics put an end to suspense and tension. Both are present for a while as Carol fights off sleep to protect her son but the desire to ""dazzle"" audiences with spectacle undermines these fragile elements. In its current form The Invasion is an erratically assembled mess that fails to satisfy the expectations of any genres adherents. It moves fast enough that boredom is unlikely but the ending is so weak that it will leave many viewers wondering why they bothered going along for the ride in the first place.

All good things must come to an end -- in this case the lucky streak thats made every adaptation of Jack Finneys 1955 sci-fi novel ""The Body Snatchers"" distinctive and effective until now. Troubled production ""The Invasion"" -- of which the Wachowski brothers reportedly reshot at least a third after helmer Oliver Hirschbiegels cut failed to please suits -- emerges a slick but forgettable characterless thriller. Lure of Nicole Kidman Daniel Craigs first post-Bond role and large-scale PG-13 action-horror could produce OK opening numbers but steep falloff is guaranteed. Ancillary may drag pic into the eventual black. Though none has been a box office behemoth every prior version of this tale has worked on its own terms Don Siegels classic small-town-Americana ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956); Philip Kaufmans witty same-named 1978 San Francisco update; ""Body Snatchers"" (1993) Abel Ferraras creepsome military-base take; and even Robert Rodriguezs gleeful ""The Faculty"" (1998) an unacknowledged but obvious transcription that cannily turned alien possession into another form of high school peer pressure. Perhaps auds will eventually get to see what German helmer Hirschbiegel making his English-language feature debut and scenarist David Kajganich intended in directors-cut DVD form. Purportedly it was offbeat politically barbed and quasi-documentary in style. Those qualities are MIA in the current ""Invasion"" whose occasional nods to earlier versions (Veronica Cartwright memorable in the Kaufman version has a brief role here) only serve as a reminder of how much better they were. The disintegration of a space shuttle making unplanned re-entry into the Earths atmosphere leaves a trail of debris that turns out to be contaminated with highly contagious alien spores. Among the first infected is Center for Disease Control honcho Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam) whos thus in a position to help the pandemic swiftly infiltrate government media police and other social infrastructures. Thus whats publicized as a mere ""dangerous flu virus"" is in fact turning people into emotionless automatons whose first priority is to entrap human holdouts. Tuckers ex-wife happens to be Washington D.C. psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Kidman) whos not pleased when after years of disinterest he suddenly wants to see their young son Oliver (Jackson Bond). She reluctantly drops the boy off for a sleepover then spends the evening at a diplomats dinner party on the arm of Ben Driscoll (Craig) a doctor whod like to be more than her best friend. Returning home late that night shes nearly home-invaded by a scary alleged census worker. The next day almost everybody seems weirder -- and after just 40 minutes the movie starts unsubtly inserting jump-cut flashbacks (then flash-forwards) as if auds couldnt be trusted to catch already obvious clues that something is amiss. Carol is imperiled in successive overblown chase sequences trying to recover Oliver (whos conveniently immune to the infection) with allies Ben and his colleague Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright). While earlier interpretations made Finneys premise metaphorically vivid this ""Invasion"" feels like a self-canceling mix of creative and commercial decisions. Its a clever touch that backgrounded news reports show all global conflicts neutralized in the wake of the pandemic. But in the end pic seems to awkwardly suggest war and violence as primary things that ""make us human"" a message one doubts the director of Hitler drama ""Downfall"" intended. Conversely theres rote injection of family-values sentiment as a primary narrative drive (""No one touches my child"" yelps an armed Kidman as she blows away several replicants). Since the spores take over during sleep Kidman at least has stay-awake exhaustion to play. But neither she nor Craig who has relatively few scenes can make their dully written characters compelling. As is often the case Northam is the best thing here though even his deft sinister underplaying cant salvage a scene in which Tucker acts like a stereotypical bad-ex-husband rageaholic despite conversion to zombiedom. Tech and design contributions are pro but fail to create any unique atmosphere suspense or visual interest. Perhaps the sole distinguishing element in this ""Invasion"" is that it provides a new transmission route oh-so-characteristic of our filmic era projectile barfing.
