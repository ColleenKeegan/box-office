"At the movies Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever 092002 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the movies Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever By Jocelyn Noveck| Associated Press Friday September 20 2002 Two dueling spies one a handsome hunk and the other a sexy siren duke it out for 90 minutes of high-tech combat then settle down to a few long-awaited love scenes. Weve seen it all before havent we? Too bad we dont see it in ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever."" The action film stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as the agents and with an intriguing matchup like that youd think screenwriter Alan McElroy would have found some way to get these stars together. But no. The two barely crack a smile the entire film. They barely even talk. They battle each other and others sullen expressions pasted on their faces. They join forces just as sullenly. They each have their goals to achieve but the viewer will have a hard time getting excited about that. Whats left? Fire and explosions more fire and more explosions set to the incessant sound of automatic gunfire. This film apparently changed titles a few times but its unclear whether the producers considered ""90 Minutes of Stuff Blowing Up."" Of course action-film lovers will probably enjoy the stunts - the cars and buses flipping into the air the motorcycle fights people falling backward slow-motion onto cars and so on. Theres also a sleek look to the film which is directed by Kaos (the short name for Thailands Wych Kaosayananda whose previous movie was the Thai hit ""Fha"") and shot on the streets of Vancouver - a peaceful city thats been turned here into quite a violent place. But for many viewers the big question may be not whether Ecks and Sever will get together or why they are fighting in the first place but why am I sitting here anyway? The plot is so thin the holes so gaping and the characters so colorless that you end up disliking both Banderas and Liu - which is a shame - and not caring what happens to either one. Lius character Sever is a disaffected agent of the DIA or Defense Intelligence Agency. Banderas plays Ecks a former FBI star agent whos become an empty shell of his former self since his wife was killed years earlier in an explosion. Or so he thinks. Ecks is lured back into service by his former boss with promises that his wife is still alive. And she is - married now to Gant (Gregg Henry) a menacing DIA boss who uses his young son (or so he thinks) to smuggle a microscopic injectable assassination device into the country. This device - designed to lie inside the victim until activated killing without a trace - is the prize for which the combatants are fighting. And thats supposed to be the entire source of tension in the film. Ecks finds his wife Rayne before too long - they have a rather passionless reunion in front of a big tank at the aquarium where she inexplicably goes to escape the stress of her sons kidnapping. And then its back to the fighting. Rayne is played by Talisa Soto (best known recently perhaps for marrying actor Benjamin Bratt) who is beautiful but ineffective. You end up resenting her character too - because it soon becomes clear that with her in the picture theres no way Banderas and Liu will get together or even experience an iota of romantic tension. In the films publicity notes both Banderas and Liu are said to have suggested even further cuts to the dialogue with Banderas explaining that the action itself creates the character and ""can be more telling than words."" If only that were true here. And we learn that Severs character was originally written for a male actor - which explains the lack of romance between the leads. Anybody ever heard of rewrite? ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" a Warner Bros. release is rated R for strong violence. Running time 91 minutes. One star out of four the lowest rating.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Uttered with the proper degree of distaste ""Ecks"" just about sums it up. An action film starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu Ballistic Ecks Vs. Sever looks like a video-game promo has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show and feels like a headache waiting to happen. The subtitle that looks like a jumble of Scrabble tiles breaks down as follows Banderas is an FBI agent named Jeremiah Ecks a heartbroken man pining for his wife who apparently died in an explosion a few years back. Liu is Sever a renegade from the shadowy DIAs ""Orphan Class"" a division made up of unwanted Chinese orphan girls ""trained to do nothing but kill a thousand different ways."" And kill she does piling up a body count that would embarrass Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson. The film eventually explains away the pile of corpses by revealing that Liu was trying to save a little boy from danger which pretty much says everything that needs saying about the humanity invested here. After spending half of the movie fighting each other Liu and Banderas spend the second half fighting alongside each other often in slow motion. Thai director Kaos (a.k.a. Wych Kaosayananda) doesnt come up with anything that hundreds of Hong Kong films havent done before but he does seem intent on doing it louder. Theres scarcely a two-minute stretch without an explosion usually cued by one of the characters igniting one of the dozens of bombs they presumably set up between scenes. For some reason all of this takes place in Vancouver so for those seeking a temperate climate a reasonable exchange rate and international intrigue contact your travel agent today.

SEVER. With Antonio Banderas Lucy Liu Gregg Henry Talisa Soto. Directed by Wych (Kaos) Kaosayananda. Running time 91 mins. Rated R Much carnage. At Clearview Chelsea and Sutton 57th. 1 Star. Much as the pairing of Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu in a spy thriller sounds enticing their roles in the very loud very empty ""Ballistic Ecks Vs. Sever"" could have been played just as competently by cardboard cutouts in designer cape (her) and Cerruti suit (him). They play supposed enemies from government agencies with different acronyms as they kick twirl karate-chop and outrun fireballs all over Vancouver. After a great number of beatings explosions and pileups after machine-gunnings sniper attacks and rooftop struggles after plummeting leaping and leaving seemingly tens of thousands dead in their wake Ecks (Banderas) and Sever (Liu) realize that gee they have a lot in common. The nonsensical plot involves the kidnapping of a little boy but the real motivation for everything in ""Ballistic"" is to blow things up in crowded places to an ethereal soundtrack. To pay for all the explosions and stunt work the filmmakers must have decided to skimp on the screenplay. The rule of thumb is that one page of script equals one minute of movie but there is so little dialogue in ""Ballistic"" that it could have been written on a matchbook. Lius character is so busy fighting off hordes of bumbling assassins that she has time to explain only why she owns so much weaponry ""Some women buy shoes."" Thailands Wych Kaosayananda makes his Hollywood directing debut like a kid in a fireworks factory. Between explosions there is enough room left for only minimal character development Liu is determined Banderas is anguished Talisa Soto as the mother of the kidnapped boy is beside herself and Gregg Henry as the bad guy is sneering. Ecks and Sever come out of this mess with cutely matching facial scratches which can be taken about as seriously as anything else in this movie.

Comments Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever The climax of this hard-driving action picture is so stilted that Ill just dispense with the plot which pits rumpled FBI man Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) against sleek martial-arts punisher Sever (Lucy Liu) for possession of a kidnapped child. Here are the best one-liners and images of destruction During a shoot-out at a mall a cop plummets away from the camera in slow motion landing on the roof of a car. Surveying the carnage afterward an FBI honcho remarks ""What happened--somebody get too much foam in their latte?"" As Banderas is being transported to prison an explosion sends his bus sliding down the highway on its side. Asked about her impressive collection of firearms Liu replies ""Some women buy shoes . . . "" And during the final fury in a scrap-metal yard an explosion sends two junked cars flying into the air along parallel paths. Before seeing this film I couldnt understand why the producers had given it a subtitle; afterward I realized ""Ecks vs. Sever"" was probably the full script. Directed by Wych Kaosayananda. 91 min.

"Its Just Noisy Action and Thats Enough - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Its Just Noisy Action and Thats EnoughThe cool-looking Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas crank up the mayhem in Ballistic.September 20 2002|MANOHLA DARGIS | TIMES STAFF WRITER In Ridley Scotts ""G.I. Jane"" Demi Moores character in training for the Navy SEALs as the first woman recruit asks a medic why the guys join. Explains the medic ""To blow [stuff] up."" It would be hard to find a more perfect expression of the primitive pleasure involved with watching movies such as the new action movie ""Ballistic Ecks Vs. Sever"" than that. For years one of my preferred ends to an exasperating day has been to rent a Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer movie then settle back to watch stuff blow up. Theres no defense for movies like these but neither do they warrant apology; theyre irresistibly watchable like car wrecks.Big noisy nonsense ""Ballistic"" stars Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas as operatives who wear their world-weariness with all the insouciance of a couple of Milanese runway models. Directed by Thai newcomer Kaos who was born Wych Kaosayananda and written by the less flamboyantly named Alan McElroy the film brings the two stars together by way of all the usual rogue-agent complications and a doozy of a plot twist Lius character Sever is a member of something called the Orphan Class Chinese girls who instead of being adopted by nice American families have been raised to become assassins by the Department Intelligence Agency an outfit that really exists and presumably did not vet the script.The agents are supposed to be sworn enemies but seem on friendly enough terms to have coordinated their matching wardrobes of black on black with a few accents of color. As with Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" Liu also wears sunglasses with her overcoat a confusing combination when it comes to the weather perhaps but one that secures her place in a long movie tradition of killers whose appearance is as cool as their attitude. To that end Liu and Banderas both look great when running shooting guns sailing through the air shooting guns riding his and her motorcycles activities that essentially sum up most of the action and plot and along with the usual foreign-market concerns help explain why neither actor does much talking.As if to complement her minimalist dialogue Liu brandishes exactly two expressions as the flyweight terminator--impassive and slightly less than impassive the latter of which she reserves for wielding flamethrowers and involves a soft furrowing between her well-manicured eyebrows. When not furrowing running or shooting she generally can be seen firmly standing her ground while posed against the backlit sewer steam that wafts through every frame. Shes as ferocious as a Chihuahua (a really mean Chihuahua) which complements Banderas who brings his customary affability to the role of a former FBI agent in mourning for his dead wife. Even (or maybe especially when) throwing punches at Liu he comes across as a nice guy.As with many contemporary action movie directors Kaos whose only other feature was a 1998 film called ""Fha"" has made a study of John Woo James Cameron and the oeuvres of producer-auteurs Silver and Bruckheimer (at least before the latter started on the road to mid-cult respectability). ""Ballistic"" is a generic blur of metallic blue and fireball orange set to the contrapuntal sounds of throbbing techno and eardrum-puncturing noise. Theres nothing terribly original to any of it outside of some impressively choreographed stunt work specifically a chase sequence that culminates with two police cars pirouetting through the air with the sort of grace and precision you associate with Russian skaters not Chevy Caprices.If low-end kicks were all that ""Ballistic"" had to offer then there would be nothing left to say; but watching this action movie had an unexpected effect. Fairly early on in the film theres a frenetic sequence in which Sever almost single-handedly lays waste to several downtown urban blocks while fending off fleets of heavily armed agents and police. During the orchestrated mayhem automobiles crash civilians run screaming and in one disconcertingly lifelike stunt a sharpshooter falls to his death from a rooftop with the camera chasing right after him. However simulated the relentlessness of Lius blank purpose and the verisimilitude of the destruction shaded the whole episode far darker than the filmmakers probably imagined or wanted.This isnt a moral judgment; its just an observation about how life has a way of changing even our more trivial distractions.MPAA rating R for strong violence.

"Goosey Lucy Ballistic a Lot of Noisy Dumdum washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Correction to This Article The movie ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" is rated R. A Sept. 20 review in Style incorrectly reported the rating. Goosey Lucy Ballistic a Lot of Noisy Dumdum Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 20 2002 We like Lucy Liu. We like her a lot. But someone else who likes her is the director calling himself Kaos who would much rather watch her pose particularly in black leather with a gun than act. Thats all he lets her do in the idiotic banal ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" a movie every bit as stupid as its exceedingly stupid title. You could run this film backward soundtrack included and it would make no less sense. Its a Moebius strip of stylized stunt set pieces and slow-motion explosions with vehicles that fly through the air in perfect rhythm like syncopated swimmers. Its almost completely uninvolving as well as being impenetrable. Liu plays Sever some kind of Asian super-agent evidently recruited to the America DIA a play on A? duh A? CIA evidently betrayed by her own recruiters and now gone rogue. She opens the film in de rigueur black leather by kung-fuing the bejabbers out of some nasty boys and removing the object of their care from them a small boy whom she keeps caged in a warehouse and feeds microwaved macaroni and cheese. Lucy you may do this to me. I will eat any microwaved dish you prepare me though I do prefer the Stouffers Lean Cuisine Three-Bean Chili. You may even lock me in a cage. But please dont do this stuff to a kid. The boy is the son of A? oh I forget if I even knew in the first place. I think it changes. First hes one guys son then anothers. Anyway another super-agent named Ecks (why not I wonder Triple-Ecks?) is recruited from the local sad-guy bar where hes drowning his troubles in vodka and shaving-avoidance strategies and put on her tail. This is the charismatic Antonio Banderas though it appears he checked his charisma at the border. Also on her tail the entire machine gun owners community of greater Vancouver B.C. Thats another goofy thing about the movie Its set in a Canadian city that is referred to by name many times while all the agents are Americans and no Canadian police officers are anywhere in sight. Well parsing ""Ballistic"" for errors in fact logic physics and history is clearly pointless as is the movie itself. Let it just be said that Kaos (actually the Thai director Wych Kaosayananda) gives Liu the full mythic treatment but never lets her act human or even actressy. Shes just a Kabuki figure with guns and almost no dialogue appearing out of the fog on chilly Canadian evenings to spray-paint fleets of anonymous men in Tommy Tactical suits with 9mm droplets while modeling eyes that make you think that theres a better way somehow even if it only involves a single night in a cheap motel in Encino. Things blow up acres of glass are shattered (think of the wasted sand) Banderas gets to snarl and Liu gets to pose. I thought she didnt want to be a model. BALLISTIC ECKS VS. SEVER (PG-13 90 minutes) A? Contains violence and sexual innuendo. At area theaters.

Masons novel about a young British officer (Heath Ledger) branded a coward when he refuses to ship out to the Sudan with his unit in the late 19th century. The fourth of his delivered feathers which symbolize his cowardice comes from his fiancee. It tends to motivate a guy. More on the movies The Four Feathers (out of four) Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever But by the time Ledger dons Arab disguise to fight so-called ""Muhammaden fanatics"" in his own way the movie already has been done in by sluggish exposition involving an officer friend (Wes Bentley) who also is a rival for his intended (Kate Hudson). At least the combat scenes when they finally come are filled with lots of artfully composed Panavision sand. For those who thought director Shekhar Kapurs previous film Elizabeth was painfully overrated you are free to say ""I told you so."" His stodgy style halts the momentum of young actors who have impressed in other movies Ledger (The Patriot) Bentley (American Beauty) and Hudson (Oscar-nominated for Almost Famous). Theyre appallingly stiff in a screen bundle of leaden feathers unlikely to tickle anyone. (PG-13 intense battle sequences disturbing images violence and some sensuality) Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever For years people have joked about an action movie that might eliminate plot altogether and simply cut to the pyrotechnics. Someone has finally done it. Antonio Banderas is a former FBI agent and the facially immobile Lucy Liu is a kind of one-woman Charlies Devil. When not kicking and punching shes detonating explosions on Vancouver streets to extremes that extend well beyond self-parody. Two young children (one dead another threatened) motivate the actions of these initial adversaries though a legitimate world threat also is a factor. An international villain played by the sneering Gregg Henry has come up with an assassination device that can be implanted in intended victims. This is a movie in which you rarely know where you are or whos doing what to the next person. The director is Thailands Wych Kaosayananda who goes professionally by the name of ""Kaos.""

Directed by Kaos from a screenplay by Alan McElroy. 90 minutes. Rated R for strong violence. Several theaters. They used to do a sketch on ""SCTV"" called ""Farm Film Report"" with Big Jim McBob and Billy Saul Hurok (John Candy and Joe Flaherty) who would review films based on how many things got ""blowed up."" If enough things got ""blowed up"" well that was a good picture. ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" is a picture for Big Jim McBob and Billy Saul Hurok. Which is to say its a picture for idiots. A boy is kidnapped amid many slow-motion explosions by a slim hooded figure who at the last instant removes the hood to reveal -- gasp -- a woman Agent Sever (Lucy Liu). The child is the son of Gant (Gregg Henry) the head of a U.S. spy agency whose team recently stole a microscopic ""assassination device"" from a German laboratory. Sever herself is a former agent of Gants. Whats her game plan? Could she the star Lucy Liu be evil? Or is the evil one Gant -- he of the creepy drawn-on lips and sadistic sneer? To find out super-agent Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is forced out of retirement which he seems to have spent drinking and smoking (in slow motion) at the local bar. His wife was killed in an explosion some years back and hes never gotten over it. Now his boss tells him his wife is alive; but hell only divulge her whereabouts if Ecks tracks down Sever. The agency does this for him. They attack her in a Vancouver B.C. mall where shes been shopping (in slow motion) and where she quickly lays waste to all of them. Ecks gives chase and were treated rather early to the grand battle implicit in the title which since Liu trained for her role for months and Banderas apparently not at all isnt so grand and is mostly shot from a distance. The film only gets worse and the reunion scene between Ecks and his wife is seat-squirmingly awful. Its one of the few moments where there isnt an explosion and where we really couldve used one.

SEVER Action. Starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu. Directed by Kaos. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What we have here is a series of highly unpleasant incidents. There are countless shootings myriad explosions a plethora of beatings a brace of knife attacks and repeated sightings of Antonio Banderas needing a shave. Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all. Movies dont get much worse. ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" may be the future of action movies in that it takes a strain within the genre and brings it to its logical destination Virtually all action virtually no movie. But if thats where action is heading its heading for a dead end. The letdown of ""Ecks vs. Sever"" is so complete that it fails even to make good on the promise implied by its title. It suggests a spy-versus-spy movie in which two equally matched secret-agent masterminds go at it while we watch in awe. In fact the agents as presented here are not equally matched. If Sever played by Lucy Liu is a high-performance killing machine Ecks is a fuel-efficient killing machine. Shed win every time. Plus theyre never really enemies and its only for a brief period that theyre fighting each other at all. The trailers promised a movie a lot more interesting than the one that was actually made. WHAT REALLY MATTERS To talk immediately about the story would give the false impression that its an essential part of the experience of ""Ballistic"" so first lets deal with two things that really matter here The movies look and its sound. The look is metallic. Were seeing this a lot lately pictures in which the world seems steel-plated in which everything is a hard gray or a pale blue. In ""Ballistic"" the effect is cold even alienating. This coldness is emphasized by the soundtrack by Don Davis who did the music for ""The Matrix"" (a good movie not to be spoken of in the same breath as this one). Here the music doesnt get underneath and enhance the screen action but lies on top and flattens it. For the kinetic moments we get a computerized heavy-metal type sound -- as if the music were saying ""Here we go again with more of the same."" The music in the nonviolent scenes is equally distancing consisting mainly of choruses of women yodeling ""Ahhh ahhh ahh"" over a New Age synthesizer. In the latter case the music makes the scenes feel as though they already happened long ago and now were finally seeing them. PREPACKAGED SENTIMENT The story is just an amalgam of prepackaged sentiment there to serve as a pretext for the violence. For the last nine years Ecks has been under the impression that his wife is dead. By coincidence his wife (Talisa Soto) has been under the impression that he is dead. Ecks must be the worlds worst secret agent if other agents can keep the existence of a misplaced spouse from him for the better part of a decade. Either that or Ecks and Mrs. Ecks are a uniquely uninquisitive couple. As the action begins Ecks finds out that his wife is alive and Sever is the one who knows where she is. Thats enough to get things started. Banderas goes through the movie looking very tired -- so tired its easy to forgive him for making us tired. Lucy Liu just looks embarrassed but as if shes straight-facing it determined to get out with some dignity and she does. The picture was directed by a Thai filmmaker who goes by the name of Kaos and the moniker fits. But after ""Ballistic"" Id rather watch a movie by Control. Advisory This film contains almost nonstop violence.

Its still terrible Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News It doesnt bother me that the post-""Matrix"" new wave of Hong Kong-influenced Hollywood action films have abandoned any pretense of coherent storytelling and now treat plot exactly the way porn movies do -- as a device to get from one bang to the next. Action cinema has been moving in that direction for some time driven by commercials music videos and video games. And I suppose that you could argue that its more honest No one will give a crap for example about the vague and incomprehensible characters played by Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu in the new ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever."" What actually bothers me -- what may reveal me to be a pretentious aging aesthete unable to adjust to the new era of non-narrative post-whatever -- is the music. You know what Im talking about That stomped-by-robots electronica video-game soundtrack that refuses to stop no matter what the context. Youre sitting there watching any old scene in ""Ballistic"" -- a 6-year-old getting off a plane a car driving down a deserted street whatever -- and the soundtrack is all relentless wicky-wacky-humpa-thumpa complete with moaning female vocals. You get to the point where you cant tell if youre in a movie theater or some nightclub full of leather pants hair gel and Argentine women who wont talk to you. Set to that soundtrack most of ""Ballistic"" involves the mysterious Agent Sever (Liu) for unexplained reasons machine-gunning cops by the score destroying the Vancouver public library and blowing up boxcars. The director known as Kaos (thats the nom de boom of Thai-born Wych Kaosayananda) loves exploding boxcars. A lot of exploding boxcars. Some railroad was able to get rid of a whole bunch of outdated rolling stock here; the tax consequences must have been significant. Whoomp whoomp whoomp whoomp. The other part of ""Ballistic"" features the slightly less mysterious Agent Ecks (Banderas) delivering a smoldering glare inhaling Marlboros and blowing people away. During all the violence the techno soundtrack is generally appropriate; perhaps it was just too much trouble to turn it off during the non-boxcar scenes. Kaos -- at least his name has vowels unlike that of McG who directed the Hong Kong-influenced ""Charlies Angels"" -- can do two things or maybe two and a half. He creates cool deep-focus shots in the middle of his action sequences although the sequences as a whole are confusing and hard to follow. He also rips off little snippets of film noir a moody unshaven guy with a turned-up collar and fedora flicking away a cigarette. And his half-a-thing is his compulsive use of slo-mo shots in any scene and for no particular reason. The cigarette flick the inverted car sailing through the air Agent Sever leaping off an exploding boxcar -- it all slows way the hell down possibly to seem more momentous. ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" sure sounds like a title borrowed from a video game or comic book (and in fact it is a video game contrary to what I originally wrote here). Nintendo junkies might have better luck with the story than I did All I could really make out is that Banderas plays Ecks as a cheerful caricature of the wounded noir hero smoking and drinking in a dark tavern to soothe the wounds left behind by his dead wife (Talisa Soto). Except that wifey may not be dead after all but hooked up with some sinister double-agent type named Gant (Gregg Henry) whos smuggling some super-secret microscopic death gizmo into the country in the most evil way possible. You Might Also Like With his WASPy Mount Rushmore head virtually reeking of mendacity corruption and a Yale education Henry provides the most amusing of this movies overstylized performances. Plus he has a perfectly lovely home overlooking the water West Coast casual meets Japanese formal. Kaos and his production team do make pretty good use of Vancouver which is quite an attractive city when it isnt exploding. Lius long lean form is on screen a lot but shes pretty much just her own stunt double; Id be surprised if she has 60 seconds of dialogue in the whole picture. (Mind you the screenplay by Peter M. Lenkov and Alan B. McElroy would probably fit on a matchbook in the spaces around that pirate from the art-by-mail school.) Whoever Sever is -- a Chinese orphan girl trained to kill kill kill? A ""disaffected"" DIA agent? -- shes pissed at the world and seeking revenge for unknown offenses. Sever does meet up with Ecks but the two only do battle in two scenes before they team up against the bad guy. Clearly ""Ecks and Sever Blow Up Boxcars and Kick Everybodys Ass"" was way too long for theater marquees. Kaos the screenwriters and the actors occasionally seem to forget even the tiny handful of plot points that have been established such as the names of the characters. Looking at the pile of pills Ecks inhales a fellow agent who presumably knows him quips ""Is that why they call you Ecks?"" Um no -- Ecks is his name. (Although the question of whether his first name is Jeremy or Jeremiah depends on whos talking to him.) No one involved with ""Ballistic"" is any too clear on the United States of America and its boundaries either. Whats with the smirking federal agent boasting an East End Cockney accent (played by Ray Park of ""X-Men"")? Is the CIA recruiting thugs off third-division English soccer teams? And how come all these high-ranking American spooks are bustin heads and takin names in Vancouver anyway? I know Canada is kind of like the 51st state but at least in the narrow legalistic sense it isnt American soil. All these complaints are irrelevant of course. As far as random useless action movies go Ive seen worse. ""Ballistic"" will undoubtedly do decent business for a few weeks. But to compare a director like Kaos to Hong Kong action kings like John Woo or Tsui Hark (""Once Upon a Time in China"" and the ""Swordsman"" series) who always believe in their story and characters no matter how outlandish they may be is like comparing the director of ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" to Hitchcock. (Hey they both made English-language thrillers.) Just because a guy is Asian and likes to blow up boxcars doesnt make him a cinema revolutionary. This too like other stupid Hollywood trends shall pass. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

SEVER ""Ecks"" this one off your must-see list. Running time 93 minutes. Rated R (non-gory violence profanity). At the E-Walk the Chelsea the Union Square others. THE awkwardly titled ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever"" (try saying it 10 times fast) amply demonstrates how even a movie with wall-to-wall action can be a crashing bore. Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu play Ecks and Sever respectively a pair of crack secret agents whose numerous battles - involving explosions many wrecked vehicles bazookas and body bags - lay waste to downtown Vancouver. This 70-million mistake from the schlockmeisters at Franchise Pictures - the folks who have given us ""Feardotcom"" and ""City By the Sea"" in the last three weeks - is the Hollywood debut of Thai action director Wych Kaosayananda who also goes by the name Kaos. You might as well call him Inkoherence for all the sense this flick makes. The plot - something about a mysterious billionaire (Gregg Henry) a kidnapped child a stolen weapon and Ecks supposedly dead wife (Talisa Soto) - is the flimsiest excuse for an endless string of mindless stunts and mayhem which are all the more offensive because not a drop of blood is shed. Want to see a stuntman fall from the top of a skyscraper all the way onto the roof of a car? This is the movie for you. There isnt much for the rest of us in this proudly stupid movie which is rendered all the more confusing by the grizzled and bored-looking Banderas who mumbles and/or whispers most of his lines. Liu tries half-heartedly to recapture her ""Charlies Angels"" panache but her martial-arts moves here look stunningly phony - and she often seems to be reading her lines off cue cards. ""Where did you get all this ordnance"" Ecks - who joins forces with Sever in the last half hour effectively extinguishing whatever minimal interest ""Ballistic"" held - asks Sever when he discovers a formidable weapons cache in her hideout. ""Some women buy shoes"" Sever shrugs. Such is this humorless flicks idea of wit.

Stephen Cole Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 20 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 113AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever Directed by Kaos Written by Alan McElroy Starring Antonio Banderas Lucy Liu Gregg Henry Ray Park and Talisa Soto Classification AA Rating 1/2 Andy Warhols other great maxim about fame ""Dont read your press notices weigh them"" is relevant to the career of Lucy Liu. The once and future star of Charlies Angels is now considered the queen of kick ass even though her every big-screen performance from Payback to Shanghai Noon has been rendered in invisible ink. Ten minutes after the movie you forget she was ever there. Liu currently co-stars with Antonio Banderas freed from parenting duties in Spy Kids II in the action thriller Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever. Shes Sever and over the course of 90 minutes Liu acts out her name by tearing 100 or so villains limb from limb. Plus every now and then she pulls a bazooka out of thin air and -- fffpow -- sends a truck or train sky-high. Still as a film combatant Liu never really entertains or impresses. A lot of the hand-to-hand fighting is either speeded up or slowed down. Sure sign that the camera man and editor are doing all the hard work. And the actress can never summon the cold relish we look for in an action hero. To paraphrase Muhammad Ali If Liu even dreamed of whupping Michelle Yeoh martial-arts star of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon she should wake up and apologize. Perhaps because hes asked to throw his fights with Liu co-star Banderas normally a game and attractive action star goes into a film-long sulk here. Which is unfortunate because Ballistic a very loud action flick that flubs both its gadget premise and back story is in desperate need of charm and energy. The first Hollywood film from Thai filmmaker Kaos could also used a good script editor. I had to read the press material to remember that the bad guy (De Palma bit player Gregg Henry) hoped to take over the global espionage industry with an ingenious device that is injected in a victims body then lies dormant until activated blah blah blah. And theres just no figuring how Banderass lost wife Lius missing baby various assassination attempts and the bad guys plan for world domination ever fit together. About the only fun to be had in the movie is screenwriter Alan McElroys cartoon spook-speak. Connoisseurs of bad action-movie dialogue will delight in scenes that have ""DIA"" operatives dressed in what look like black beekeeper outfits racing about Vancouver with machine guns slung over their shoulders shouting directions into walkie-talkies trying to figure out what to do with Lucy Liu. Instead of saying as normal breathless people might ""Do you see her?"" and ""yep"" the DIA agents call out ""Do you have a positive visual?"" and ""Affirmative."" When one DIA drone wanders somewhere he shouldnt he is cautioned ""Thats an unacceptable level of exposure."" Unless youre looking to positively visualize more of the same it might be a good idea to go somewhere other than Ballistic this weekend.

Proof of this is ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever."" One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout but a hundred of them can be numbing. Proof of this is ""Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever."" Remote non-involving and finally incomprehensible chopsocky/blow-em-up U.S. debut of Thai helmer Wych Kaosayananda (credited except in the possessory line under the all-too-appropriate sobriquet of ""Kaos"") will hardly light a candle let alone a firecracker under early fall B.O. Homevid fans will pick up the slack. Project reps interest for Asiaphiles as the first case of a Thai filmmaker being recruited to lead a large-budget (70 million estimated) Hollywood production. Kaos 1998 debut ""Fha"" is one of Thailands all-time B.O. champs and its display of action staging drew trans-Pacific attention. First 10 minutes of nonstop action confirm reports that Alan McElroys script inspired a new videogame -- thus reversing the trend of game-into-movie. Concerned mom Vinn (Talisa Soto) watches as the operatives of her husband Gant (Gregg Henry) yank their son Michael (Aidan Drummond) out of her car followed by a silent deadly high-kicking killer staging an explosive auto pileup. The killer reveals herself as Sever (Lucy Liu) whose frigidly solid facial expression alone informs that she means business. An FBI task force headed by Julio Martin (Miguel Sandoval) -- which has been hunting for Gant and his prototype of a deadly ""assassination device"" that can be injected inside an unsuspecting victim -- unceremoniously pulls ex-agent Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) back into the force. Of course Ecks -like Sever -- displays his own swift moves early on so theres no doubt that these two will go to war against each other before film ends. The difference between the two as the script all too literally spells out is that Ecks is being forced into the hunt while this is all personal for Sever a former Defense Intelligence Agency agent whose only child was killed in a raid arranged by Gant. Not that Ecks doesnt have his own primitive backstory as well Thinking his wife was killed in a car bombing hes told both by Martin and later by Sever that shes alive and will be all his once he concludes this little assignment. Of course the assignment involves dealing with Sever who proves to be a one-woman army detonating half of Vancouver (used here as the actual rather than stand-in setting) when she isnt strafing the poor city with bullets. The storyline which in its best moments recalls Mad magazines sublime ""Spy Vs. Spy"" with all the humor excised is upstaged by a parade of stunts martial arts fighting car chases and endless explosions. Action fanatics will argue over their favorite bit from real cars hurtling over Banderas head to the slo-mo fetish shots of Liu whipping her long manes around to get off another shot. Yet for all of the conspicuous intent to stage action set pieces mainly on the set and with a minimum of digitally aided post-production pic fails to supplement this physical capacity with intense visual excitement.Of the starring duo Liu comes off far better if only because she shows fine instincts for playing a killer of extremely contained emotions and even fewer words. Its tempting at moments to imagine that all of this nonsensical skullduggery is a nightmare inside the mind of Banderas dad character in ""Spy Kids"" but Banderas -- who mumbles or outright swallows much of his dialogue -- manages only the most glum perfunctory moods and expressions making for ashallow hero. Once again Henry and his sculptural visage of supreme evil is extremely easy to boo but role reps yet another case of this superb actor being slotted into something far below his skill level. Free of his ""Phantom Menace"" and ""X-Men"" costumes and masks Ray Park is just another Brit-accented bad guy. The real stars on the production end are extremely active stunt coordinator Joel J. Kramer and fight choreographer Philip Tan who arranges moves that are cool by Hollywood standards (with a few nods to ""The Matrix"") but fairly commonplace by Asian ones. Julio Macats lensing is more about multiple camera coverage than aesthetics and Don Davis thrash-guitar score is all about noise.

Duck `Ballistic Missile Lands With A Thud - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Kidnapping Duck `Ballistic Missile Lands With A ThudMovies - REVIEW - Ballistic Ecks Vs. SeverSeptember 20 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticTo the civilized mind a movie like Ballistic Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement.A collection of explosions shootings high-speed chases and other assorted violent incidents loosely strapped together by a ludicrous kidnapping plot the film hardly qualifies as entertainment. But if monster-truck rallies and professional wrestling can command huge audiences based largely on their macho aggression Ballistic possibly will too.About that ludicrous plotWhen a mysterious woman known as Sever (Lucy Liu) kidnaps a young boy a former FBI agent called Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is pressed into service to find him. Also in there somewhere is Ecks missing wife and the merciless Gant (Gregg Henry) from whom the boy was taken.Among other absurdities were expected to believe that Ecks is unaware that his wife who supposedly died seven years earlier is still alive. (She still loves him and has not been prevented from contacting him. In fact there are extremely compelling reasons for her to have done so.)It makes about as much sense to talk about performances in a movie like this as it does to discuss special effects in a movie like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood If there are any in there youre not supposed to notice them.Ballistic (which opens today) was directed by Kaos a young filmmaker from Thailand making his Hollywood debut.Kaos is the perfect name for the man who made this picture. Even the variant spelling seems somehow to fit.A more chaotic and wrongheaded movie you are unlikely to see.

Cross Gregg Henry Ray Park Talisa Soto; Director Wych Kaosayananda; Author Peter M. Lenkov Alan B. McElroy; Release Date Wide 09/20/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 18 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT In 1995s ""Assassins"" Antonio Banderas squared off against Sylvester Stallone as well assassins trying to uh assassinate each other. Now in Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever directed by Kaos (not ""Get Smart""s evil organization but a nom de film for Thai tyro Wych Kaosayananda) Banderas faces an even tougher adversary...would you believe Lucy Liu? Actually with her cruel beauty and kick-ass ""Charlies Angels"" cred it is kinda believable for the first half hour. Then the heretofore silent Liu speaks a line and her baby-doll voice betrays her. Letting his I-dont-give-a-damn stubble do his acting Banderas plays Jeremiah Ecks an ex-FBI agent racing Lius killing machine codenamed Sever to recover a stolen plot device - er assassination device. ""Ballistic"" bombards moviegoers with a cacophony of automatic gunfire exploding vehicles and pseudo-techno music but what else would you expect from a guy who lists Michael Bay as one of his influences? Kaos was apparently aiming for a coolly stylized straight-faced take on ""Spy vs. Spy."" As Maxwell Smart used to say ""Missed it by that much.""
