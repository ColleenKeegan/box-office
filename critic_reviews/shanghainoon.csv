Starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Directed by Tom Dey. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jackie Chan is back long-haired and looser and goosier than he was in ""Rush Hour"" with another English-language crossover action comedy called ""Shanghai Noon."" This one is sillier and all the better for it. Screwball kung fu. The American co-star formula continues to work. Last time it was fast-talking Chris Tucker. Now its slippery Owen Wilson whose cubist nose goes off in several directions at once and who seems to be grinning at some private joke. Not many people saw Wilson his last time out as a serial killer in Hampton Fanchers ""The Minus Man."" ""Shanghai Noon"" is certain to make up for that oversight even as it goes up against the ""MI-2"" juggernaut this weekend. The multiplex head-butting pits the styles of two transplanted kingpins of Hong Kong movies against each other. John Woos sequel to ""Mission Impossible"" is so hard-surfaced that the fun bounces off it. Chans ""Shanghai Noon"" is a lot more playful -- and with nowhere near as much in the way of digital effects. Chan is his own digital effect. At 46 he continues to do his own stunts -- the younger Wilson needs some stuntman help -- even if the emphasis now is more on the comic than the acrobatic. A you-aint-seen-nuthin-yet exception comes when Chan hotfoots it over logs rolling off a moving freight train. It is the mid-19th century. Chan plays Chon Wang an Imperial Guard in the Forbidden City sent from China to the Old West to rescue a kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu). Wilson who is one quirky hombre plays outlaw Roy OBannon. Hes not the hotshot he thinks he is and the next thing he knows he ends up buried up to his neck in the ground which is where Chan finds him. OBannon charmingly anachronistic thinks karma has brought them together. Chon Wang becomes a John Wayne from Imperial Guard to outlaw. This is a buddy movie with a cross-cultural spin. Its Butch Cassidy and the Shanghai Kid which will be what Chanll be called on ""wanted"" posters. Wilson teaches Chan how to sling a gun and say ""howdy pardner"" and Chan teaches him a Chinese drinking game as they soak side-by-side in tubs. Chan works frontier variations on martial arts devices. He swings a mean pigtail ties a horseshoe to a rope for a weapon and comes up with an ingenious method to bend jail bars. He bends the rules too. All the Wild West types in ""Shanghai Noon"" are stock comic figures but with an ethnic twist. This is almost Mel Brooks territory The frontiersmen think the Chinese are Jews while the white settlers think its the Crow Indians who are. Whoosh Off-the-wall remarks fly like the tomahawks Chan tosses back at the Indians. The Indians call Chan in his Imperial Guard ceremonial gown the Man Who Fights in a Dress. Chon Wang who loosens up with a toke off a peace pipe discovers that Indian hospitality includes marrying the chiefs daughter which provokes a comment from among the assembled Crow ""At least hes not a white guy."" The irreverent ""Shanghai Noon"" was directed by first-timer Tom Dey who comes from TV commercials and who by the way studied philosophy of religion as an undergraduate. This is equal-opportunity nuttiness and theres a method to it. The rawboned straw-haired Wilson is the whitest guy around and all the ethnic banter suddenly folds back on itself with an overheard slur in a bordello that threatens the race-straddling buddy relationship. Putting it back together may have something to do with this comedy stretching out beyond an ideal 90 minutes. The women still get shortchanged. Brandon Merrill a genuine rodeo champion from Cheyenne Wyo. is seen too briefly as the Indian bride. Liu (""Ally McBeal"" ""Play It to the Bone"") is too much of a bombshell to be constrained in the role of a princess. Fortunately someone finally finds an excuse to let her bust out. Contains comic violence. ..

With a long black pigtail flowing down the back of his embroidered tunic fending off bad white men and rescuing good Indians (who in gratitude name him Man-Who-Fights-in-Dress) Chan clowns and whirls his way through American history panning for laughs and showing the inventively nimble moves hes still capable of -- at reduced speed -- in early middle age. And in case you missed the cross-cultural pun in the title heres another Disguising himself as a gun-toting cowboy in order to rescue the Chinese Princess Pei-Pei (Ally McBeals Lucy Liu) who has been spirited from the Forbidden City and held for ransom in frontier Nevada the diminutive acrobatic hero calls himself Chon Wang. Ha ha Pilgrim Certainly Chan is an unlikely pardner for Owen Wilson as Roy OBannon a Sundance Kid wannabe whose hankering for gunslinger fame is regularly undone by his corner-cutting attitude toward the business of robbery. Wilsons a charming portrayer of men who are wackier than their blase-yuppie exterior suggests but his Roy veers from comedically ornery to downright trying He looks for a big laugh everytime he pronounces the princess name as ""pee-pee"" rather than ""pay-pay."" Thus uncomfortably yoked the two amigos squabble their way through adventures mishaps and unexceptional fight sequences. There are a lot of one-liners heavy as tombstones in the strained script by Lethal Weapon 4s Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (""Theyre not Injuns woman theyre...Jews"" an ignorant local tells his wife in a particularly lame non sequitur). And in his feature debut director Tom Dey doesnt exactly have a light touch with the nonverbal comedy load either. (Roy makes fart bubbles in his bathtub -- tee-hee Pilgrim) Of the internationally famous Asian action stars who have kicked their way through crossover movies Chan with his elfin bounce is perhaps the most adept at fish-out-of-water gymnastics. With his exceptional gift for physical comedy hes the easiest to read wordlessly; his streaky and shrieky all-action and all-mouth pairing with Chris Tucker in Rush Hour was a great chemical success. But Shanghai Noon which lacks Rush Hours manic energy also lacks confidence in its own much bigger potentially fascinating story -- an American tale of pageantry and history whimsy and social resonance embellished by Chans fancy footwork and Wilsons drollery. This is an action-comedy after all that fleetingly acknowledges the miseries of 19th-century frontier Chinese slave labor but focuses instead on a hammy Chan getting stoned on a peace pipe. What a waste of wampum. C Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Yippie-ki-kung-fu Jackie Chan rides tall in the saddle -- when he isnt busy running up walls bounding over bad guys and generally kicking up a fuss -- in ""Shanghai Noon"" a high-concept action-comedy that may score an even bigger box office bonanza than 1998s ""Rush Hour"" the Asian superstars first American produced hit. Owen Wilson (""Armageddon"" ""Bottle Rocket"") adds to the fun with an immensely appealing breakthrough performance and first-time feature helmer Tom Dey does a canny job of bringing out the best in each of his odd-couple leads. Set for a May 26 North American release as counter-programming to ""Mission Impossible 2"" this enjoyable East-meets-Western likely will succeed on its own terms as a sure-fire long-legged crowd-pleaser. Pic should also lasso strong international B.O. and ancillary biz. Opening scenes unfold in the manner of a slow wind-up for a fast pitch. In Chinas Forbidden City circa 1881 princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) opts to avoid an arranged marriage by running off to the Wild West with her American tutor (Jason Connery). A meek imperial guard Chon Wang (Chan) is unable or unwilling to hinder her departure apparently because he has a crush on the royal beauty. Unfortunately the tutor isnt all that he seems and the princess winds up held for ransom in Carson City Nev. Meanwhile back at the palace Chon begs for permission to accompany three other imperial guards charged with delivering a fortune in gold to princess Pei Peis captors. His request is approved only because Chons uncle is the royal interpreter (Henry O) whos going along for the ride. Flash forward to the Nevada desert where Roy OBannon (Wilson) a small-time outlaw who fancies himself a living legend leads his gang in a train robbery. Yes you guessed it Chon the royal interpreter and the other three imperial guards just happen to be traveling aboard the train. During the hold-up Wallace (Walton Goggins) the newest member of the bandit gang defies Roys ironclad rules against unnecessary roughness and fatally shoots Chons uncle. During an ensuing scuffle -- Chans first opportunity in pic to demonstrate his fleet-footed martial artistry -- Chon and Roy are inadvertently bounced from the train cueing the inevitable evolution of bitter enemies into fast friends. From the moment Wilson first opens his mouth sounding more like a mild-and-hazy surfer dude than a dead serious West Wild outlaw the makers of ""Shanghai Noon"" indicate that period verisimilitude isnt going to be a major priority. In the unlikely event that the audience doesnt immediately snap to the joke Dey drives the point home during the first full-scale fight scene a barroom brawl set to the beat of ZZ Tops ""La Grange."" Writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar resort to historical accuracy only when it serves their purpose In Carson City the princess is hidden in plain sight among the multitudes of Chinese laborers working on railroad construction. Lo Fong (Roger Yuan) the villainous ex-imperial guard responsible for her abduction threatens to kill scores of those workers if she tries to escape. ""Shanghai Noon"" may look like a conventional Western -- Dan Mindels impressive widescreen lensing would pass muster in any serious sagebrush saga -- but pic most certainly isnt an old-fashioned cowboys-and-Indians story. For one thing the cowboys are somewhat smaller than life Chon can barely manage to mount or dismount his horse and Roy turns to outlawry only because he thinks being a bank robber is a cool way to attract girls. As for the Indians the Sioux tribespeople on view here are rendered as bemused sophisticates not blood-thirsty savages. After he presents his daughter to Chon as a reward for valorous behavior the chief (Russel Badger) expresses misgivings about the ""marriage."" ""Dont worry"" a friend says ""it could be worse. He could be a white guy."" When theyre jailed for their part in the aforementioned barroom brawl Ray and Chon agree to put their differences aside and plan to rescue princess Pei Pei. To be sure Rays motives are less than altruistic -- he offers his assistance primarily to get his hands onat least part of the ransom. But he finds himself warming toward Chon especially after Chons Native American ""wife"" (Brandon Merrill) breaks them out of jail. Ray teaches the imperial guard how to handle six-shooters -- and how not to handle his liquor. In return Chon saves Ray from a premature demise at the hands of a corrupt sheriff (Xander Berkeley) whose name -- Van Cleef -- is a sly tribute the late Spaghetti Western star Lee Van Cleef. (Its worth noting by the way that Lee Van Cleef numbered among the bad guys who went gunning for Gary Cooper in ""High Noon."" Coincidence? Probably not.) As usual Chan is nothing less than poetry in motion evidencing graceful exuberance in his physical comedy and cunning inventiveness in his fight scenes. At various points in ""Shanghai Noon"" he uses horseshoes tree limbs moose antlers and even a sheriffs badge as props in combat. Appreciably more at ease with English here than he seemed in ""Rush Hour"" Chan radiates enough megawatt charisma to power a mid-size city and gives the impression of someone whos generously sharing the fun while hes having the time of his life. Wilson is a perfect foil reacting with equal measures of amusement and amazement each time Chan opens up a can of whup-ass on an outmatched opponent. The beauty of his performance isWilson makes it abundantly clear that Ray not Chon is the real fish out of water. For all his bold talk about becoming a babe magnet by earning notoriety as a bandit Ray is singularly ill-qualified to be an outlaw -- hes basically too laid back and easygoing which Wilson underscores by bringing a nice touch of stoner insouciance to many of his line readings. When Ray and Chon become wanted men Chon is the one who gets a bigger price on his head much to Rays frustration ""A thousand-dollar reward for a sidekick? Thats not fair."" Ray remains convinced that Chon Wang is a terrible name for a cowboy. No kidding. Lucy Liu doesnt have much to do as princess Pei Pei but she rises to the occasion when its her turn to give a good swift kick to a bad guy. Brandon Merrill has even less to do as Chons Indian bride. In fact her character simply disappears for long stretches reappearing only when the two leads need to escape a jail cell or a public execution. Other supporting players including Yuan and Berkeley fare slightly better in less sketchy roles. Once he gets the premise established and the plot humming director Dey -- a veteran of TV commercials -- does a bang-up job of keeping things fast furious and quite often very very funny. It helps a lot that hes able to afford a top flight production team to give the pic an attractive polish. But it helps even more that his two leads generate the kind of potent chemistry money cant buy. Little wonder that a ""Shanghai Noon II"" already is in the planning stages.
