BOTTOM LINE Standard conspiracy fare though Gibson is effectively menacing in his first proper acting role since 2002. CAST Mel Gibson Ray Winstone Danny Huston Bojana Novakovic. LENGTH 152 If its a Mel Gibson movie chances are hes grieving over a dead somebody and looking to make another somebody pay. Its a role that came to him early in the 1979 cheapie ""Mad Max"" and it has served him well ever since in ""Lethal Weapon"" (dead daughter) ""The Patriot"" (dead sons) and ""Braveheart"" (dead wife). Gibsons trademark combination of grief and anger has made him one of our most indelible actors You probably didnt notice that after some well-publicized controversies he hasnt starred in a movie since the 2002 chiller ""Signs"" (another dead wife). Returning in ""Edge of Darkness"" a B-minus thriller with moments of A-plus violence Gibson doesnt exactly reinvent his persona. He plays Thomas Craven a gruff Boston cop whose 24-year-old daughter takes a fatal shotgun round to the chest. Maybe he was the target - or maybe not. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Edge of Darkness"" is as workmanlike as its dogged hero. The plot parboiled down from a 1985 BBC miniseries hinges on the usual conspiracy figures most of them played by excellent if overly familiar character actors the arrogant munitions executive (Danny Huston ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") the amoral U.S. apparatchik (Denis OHare ""Duplicity"") the Cockney hit man (Ray Winstone ""The Departed""). The dead daughter (Bojana Novakovic very pretty) returns in sentimental flashbacks. Martin Campbell who directed ""Casino Royale"" mostly punches the clock here but occasionally gets a brutal groove going. The climax is a doozy with Huston providing the films best bloody moment. Gibson of course snaps and snarls and blows out some brains with a joylessness that is thoroughly enjoyable. Its like he never left.

By Anthony Lane Mel Gibson out for vengeance in Martin Campbells new movie.   Credit Illustration by John Ritter Running at more than five hours over six episodes ""Edge of Darkness"" was a tense eco-drama--not something you see every day--which appeared on British television in 1985. It was directed by Martin Campbell who a quarter of a century later is revisiting the fray. In the interim he has made one lusty Zorro movie one limp Zorro movie two of the most propulsive James Bond films ""GoldenEye"" and ""Casino Royale"" and lest we forget ""Vertical Limit"" which sounds like a biopic of Tom Cruise but is in fact an enjoyably stupid thriller about mountaineers. Now Campbell has redirected ""Edge of Darkness"" trimming it to less than two hours moving the action from Yorkshire to Boston and taking on board as his screenwriters Andrew Bovell and William Monahan--something of a Boston specialist what with his Academy Award for ""The Departed."" Mel Gibson who looks and sounds not a day over sixty-five plays a policeman named Thomas Craven. The name is a joke since the movie insists time and again that he has all but dispensed with fear. Warned by a fellow-officer that ""someone armed and dangerous"" is on the loose Craven replies ""What do you think I am?"" This is delivered not with a wink and a wild grin--we are not thank Heaven in ""Lethal Weapon"" territory--but with a pared-down dead-eyed plainness which goes with Cravens salty hair thinning at the back and the frown lines carved across his forehead like rifts in a relief map. He wears a loose-fitting suit that he might have picked up at a morgue. ""Im the guy with nothing to lose who doesnt give a shit"" he says. Youre telling me. As a rule Gibsons characters look stranded unless they have sins to atone for or frustrations to vent. Craven smiles when his daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic)--a scientific researcher home on a visit--arrives at the train station but the smile is awkward and shifty as if he were anticipating trouble. And here it is a masked gunman at his front door presumably aiming at Craven but hitting Emma by mistake. She dies in his arms the only child of a single man and from this point Craven is set on his vengeful path--weirdly calm in the confident knowledge that blood will have to be spilled. The most rousing sequence comes much later as a hit-and-run driver having already picked off an innocent woman turns the car around and comes back to flatten Craven too. And does he flee or dodge or hurl himself aside? No he takes his gun and marches firmly toward the oncoming vehicle as if the road beneath his feet were the dust of the O.K. Corral firing at the windshield as he goes. Its been thirty years since ""Mad Max"" but when it comes to man vs. machine Gibson is still up for a fight. The original plot has not been altered much though perhaps it should have been. In both cases Craven soon discovers that Emma was the intended victim and that she had been an activist bent on exposing the crimes of the nuclear industry. In the Britain of 1985 riven by a miners strike and by continuing unease over the siting of American nuclear weapons on British soil ""Edge of Darkness"" all downpours and dour moods felt true to its title. (And people were haunted by the Eric Clapton score.) To nudge it closer toward documentary Campbell showed us Emma on her final night chairing a political meeting that was addressed by a real-life Member of Parliament. The new film unrolling in a prosperous city and released at a time when some environmentalists are arguing in favor of nuclear power settles for the stale conceit of an honest soul confronting a venal private sector. Emma worked at Northmoor a firm that conducts nuclear research under government contract while quietly building a few weapons for foreign buyers on the side. (Not I would venture the most plausible part of the story.) We know this before being told because Northmoors chairman is played by Danny Huston who being a Huston is so lofty fine-mannered and molasses-voiced that he might as well wear a T-shirt with the words ""Do Not Trust This Man"" picked out in plutonium. In short where the old ""Edge of Darkness"" was an ordeal digging up surreal images from the conspiratorial murk the reboot is an adventure--an efficient politically inert fantasy that uses the hammer blow of violence to palm itself off as pertinent and gritty. The Craven of twenty-five years ago searching through his daughters bedroom after the murder found a vibrator a gun and a Teddy bear; the Craven of 2010 comes up with just the gun. That says it all. As if in deference to the storys roots we also get a mysterious and dapper Cockney (Ray Winstone) who is brought in--by whom we never find out--with the sole purpose as he admits of making everything unintelligible. Well mate you done that all right. I liked the pace and the pulse of the film but it launches no genuine surprise and despite being irradiated with scenes of sickness and morbid one-liners has little afterglow. Compare a work like Fritz Langs ""The Big Heat"" which also showed a cop and his loved one assailed by the forces of grand corruption; where Lang left his anxious viewers in no doubt that society could chew up the best of them Campbell leaves us thrilled yet reassured. One man it seems can stanch the flow of evil--not difficult perhaps when the evil isnt half as forbidding as the man. Gibson is the best thing about ""Edge of Darkness"" at once despairing and decisive although Im not sure he was wise to agree to the scene where Craven says to a bigwig ""Youd better decide whether youre hanging on the cross or banging in the nails."" Sorry Mel. That was the other movie. By popular demand ""The Red Shoes"" is returning for another run at Film Forum beginning February 19th. New York has always been kind to the movie which to the dismay of its creators Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger faltered and flopped when it opened on British screens in 1948. Salvation arrived in the form of the Bijou Theatre at Broadway and Forty-fifth Street where the film showed for more than two years. Ballet-crazy children--or ""half the little girls in America"" as Powell put it--were an important sector of that audience and I trust that some of them now in their limber seventies will head downtown to reforge an old acquaintance. What will they find? A blindingly rich and refulgent print digitally restored by the Film Foundation and the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive. Ive seen the same version on DVD but watching ""The Red Shoes"" whatever the quality on the small screen is like drinking champagne whatever the vintage through a plastic straw. The movie should fill ones vision no less comprehensively than a sunset and Powell like Turner before him--another hearty romantic Englishman whose eye gloried unashamedly in a given world--knew that reds even at their most flaming are never the whole story of a sunset. Consider Boris Lermontov (the incomparable Anton Walbrook) the impresario of a ballet company who strolls into breakfast in a full-length gown of verdigris and gold. No Chinese emperor was more resplendently arrayed. As for the cigarette that he holds out half smoked to be taken and deposited by his valet a whole civilization--urbane authoritative preposterous and doomed--resides in that single gesture. The film is a legend built on a legend. Lermontov having acquired a new prima ballerina Vicky Paige (Moira Shearer) plus a new composer Craster (Marius Goring) mounts a production of Hans Christian Andersens ""The Red Shoes"" in which a woman is danced to death by her own footwear. We see that work in its entirety and the abandon with which it is sprung from the prison of the auditorium into an unfeasible freedom of space glances back to the opening scenes of Oliviers ""Henry V"" (1944) and forward to ""An American in Paris"" (1951). Yet this is not in the end a film about ballet; it is a hymn to the risks of investing all that you are and have in the fugue and fury of the imaginative act. Look at Vicky as she dances solo to a crummy gramophone in a tiny London theatre on a rainy afternoon. She is not yet a star but Lermontov has come to observe her; we see first his face watching fiercely and then hers staring back--a milk-white death mask filling the frame with red and black dashes swooping from the corners of her eyes and lips gleaming like the poisoned apple in ""Snow White."" It is the most striking closeup in the history of cinema not for Powell the yearning of Garbo or the perplexity that Bergman found in Liv Ullmann but a sudden bright ecstasy that verges on the demonic and more than enough you might think to scare those girls of 1948 out of their tutus. ""The Red Shoes"" is both suitable for children and beyond their ken it treats art not as sedative or diversionary but as hard and supercharged quite lethal to the danceless rhythms that most of our lives obey. No wonder Britain still rationed in color food and feeling in the wake of an exhausting war could not cope with what the movie proposed. Catch it here now and you will not just be seeing an old film made new; you will have your vision restored.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

From Paris With Love and District 13 Ultimatum prove the Frenchies have somersaulted over the Chinese in delivering acrobatic action pictures. Their formula is martial arts plus homegrown parkour (or lart du deplacement) which Wikipedia defines as overcoming any obstacle within ones path by adapting ones movements to the environmentthe environment being in this case fire escapes rooftops or any setting swarming with men and automatic weapons. Pierre Morel a former cinematographer and current ace director in the Luc Besson stable made the first District 13 the rousing Taken and now the big-budget From Paris With Love a mismatched-buddy thriller starring John Travolta with a big bald dome and wispy goatee as a gonzo but disciplined American agent and Jonathan Rhys Myers as his by-the-book pointy-headed sidekick. Unlike most bloated modern action flicks this is a hair over 90 minutes and goes by even more quickly. In scene after masterly scene hordes of bad guys turn into blood-spurting pinwheels that hit the ground the instant you manage to breathe out. Exhalations become gasps of amazement. Morel will inevitably be compared to John Woo whom he trounces. He has fewer mannerisms (no damn doves) and a keener eye; his fastest most kinetic shots flow together like frames in a flipbook. When he interrupts that flow for a snatch of slow motion you see the lyricism of a warrior at full extension or the floppy-limbed contortions of a body flung to its doom. The beefy Travolta isnt the first actor to spring to mind in connection with lightning reflexes but hes souped up and limber elated by his own Zen prowess and the choreography is so expert that I never detected the stuntmen substitutions. But Morels drollest scene represents the art of taking away. Travolta bursts through a door at the top of a circular staircase while Rhys Myers waits below as one body after another sails or bounces or crunches past him. Merveilleux Another Besson confrere Patrick Alessandrin takes over in District 13 Ultimatum which reunites Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle as a bald supercop and a tattooed underworld Robin Hoodmuscular compact parkour masters for whom every building is a collection of ladders slides and trapezes for making ones escape. Its campier than its predecessor but its gung ho union of black white and Asian gangs against reactionaries whod destroy them is a virtuosic assertion of punky Parisian multiculturalism. Despite his reverence for the New Testament Mel Gibson will do anything for an excuse to not turn the other cheek. In the brutal conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness his first acting gig in years Gibson is a Boston police detective who turns vigilante to punish those behind the death of his daughter. This isnt so much a departure as a grim distillation of all that came before. The formula as always is Make Mel Mad Kidnap or kill his kid or wife and he will hurt you. The drama of the past decade has certainly hurt him His face is not so much wrinkled as creviced by rage his Aussie jauntiness long gone. Hes stripped down to pure righteous anger. Edge of Darkness is a meathead revenge picture but its very satisfying. Director Martin Campbell coming off Casino Royale has a style thats blunt and bruising and the shootings are what violence mavens call weti.e. with maximum splatter. The audience goes nuts when Gibson taunts a bad guy and hypernuts when he blows one away. Hes a ferociously committed actor with a gift for making his bad vibes contagious. Go to my blog The Projectionist for longer reviews of the stunning Ajami a mournful tapestry of carnage co-directed by the Israeli Yaron Shani and the Palestinian Scandar Copti One revenge killing leads to two leads to four and no one survives the moral miasma of the Palestinian territories; The Red Riding Trilogy three hideously bleak Yorkshire-set features based on incantatory novels by David Peace in which the bottom falls out of the standard serial-killer policier and would-be do-gooders plunge into a hopeless thicket of police corruption; and Terribly Happy a nifty Danish rural noir that redefines happily ever after as Whats buried in the bog cant hurt you.

Photo Polay Macall No matter what you think of ""Mad"" Mel Gibsons exploits as an alcoholic bigot and wacko director he remains an actor to be reckoned with in the rousing revenge melodrama ""Edge of Darkness"" his first starring role in eight years. Bringing a new gravitas to a form-fitting role as a Boston police detective investigating his whistle-blower daughters death Gibson scores a bulls-eye -- actually a great many of them -- in the films unusually cathartic climax. But thats getting ahead of what amounts to a smart cross between ""Silkwood"" and any number of earlier Gibson revenge movies. Screenwriters William Monahan (""The Departed"") and Andrew Bovell have cleverly adapted a much-respected 25-year-old British TV miniseries of the same name -- which was like this feature directed with panache by Martin Campbell (""Casino Royale""). Gibson is excellent as Martin Craven a devoted dad who watches in horror as his adult daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is blown away on the front steps of their home. Everyone assumes that the assassin who escapes was gunning for Martin. Except for Martin who alone knows that his daughter was seriously ill -- and suspects her death is somehow connected with her internship at a shadowy nuclear research facility in a scenic valley in the Berkshires. Martin gradually learns the facility may be involved in the manufacture of dirty bombs for use by foreign governments. Along the way Martin has memorable encounters with the facilitys unctuous CEO (Danny Huston) his daughters terrified boyfriend (Shawn Roberts) and in an amazingly prescient touch a Republican Massachusetts senator (Damian Young played to icy perfection). Gibsons best scenes are with Ray Winstone who reportedly replaced Robert De Niro after a day of shooting. Winstone brings a rueful humor to his juicy role as Jedburgh an enigmatic world-weary chardonnay-sipping ""fixer"" who is brought in to clean up the ""mess"" by a mysterious double-talking government ""consultant"" (Denis OHare). Campbell and his cinematographer Phil Meheux create a pervasive sense of dread with danger lurking around every corner of Boston and its environs -- including a rest stop on the Mass. Pike. My main problem with the movie is a few schmaltzy touches with the daughter including the last scene which appear to have been added to soften the pictures impact after test screening. Nevertheless this remains a tough-minded thriller that treats corporations and governments with the same sort of paranoia as 70s classics like ""The Parallax View."" Gibson has always fit well into this worldview. He also excels at grieving scenes and indulges his predilection for martyrdom especially in a scene where he is kidnapped and strapped to a gurney. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay to his work in ""Edge of Darkness"" is that I wouldnt particularly want to see this movie with grumpy Harrison Ford starring instead.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 17 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday May 30 2013 1212PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English A small-time thief becomes the heroic protector of a group of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Agnieszka Hollands new film In Darkness. While this story of yet another ""righteous Gentile"" based on Robert Marshalls non-fiction book is conventional the setting - a rat-infested sewer lit by flashlights and candles - and the memorable central performance from Robert Wieckiewicz etch themselves on the imagination. YouTube Multimedia In Darkness official trailer Hollands film which is nominated for a foreign-language Academy Award is her third Holocaust-themed feature following 1985s Angry Harvest and 1990s Europa Europa also both former Oscar nominees. By now her familiarity with the material allows her to challenge the viewer both in the films forbidding look and its often unsympathetic characters.In early scenes in 1943 in the Polish city of Lvov (now Lviv Ukraine) we see how the Nazis genocidal Final Solution is a licence to commit mass atrocities (a group of naked women racing through the woods to their deaths) and petty acts of sadism by German soldiers on the streets. None of this is much concern to Poldek Socha (Wieckiewicz) a sewer inspector and petty thief whose drinking buddy is a Nazi subaltern a Ukrainian officer (Michal Zurawski) who turns a blind eye when Poldek goes scavenging in abandoned homes.A bigot by upbringing Poldeks convinced all Jews are out to swindle him and when he encounters a group of men women and children trying to hide in the sewers his mercenary instincts kick in. He could turn them in for an immediate reward or planning ahead get them to pay him over a longer period. Along with his young apprentice Stefek (Krzysztof Skonieczny) Poldek makes a deal with a wealthy man named Chiger (Herbert Knaup) to keep the refugees in exchange for regular payments including the last of their heirloom jewellery.The refugees who have little in common beyond a desire to survive are not a harmonious group. Chiger is hated because hes wealthy and disdains to speak Yiddish. One man has abandoned his wife and daughter to take his mistress down in the sewers with him. Another (Benno Furmann) is like Poldek a hustler with the makings of a hero. The most innocent of victims are the children who still find ways to play in the filth and darkness. Each time Poldeks calculating gaze strays in the direction of the kids who are little younger than his own daughter you can see his humanity gradually overtake his habitual self-interest. When the payments runs out he comes back with more food now motivated by a pride in saving ""my Jews.""With much of the movie set in a world of perpetual night In Darkness lives up to its title. But it is brought to life in the note-perfect performance of Wieckiewicz (hell next play Lech Walesa in Andrzej Wadjas new film Walesa). A stocky beady-eyed Polish everyman with a rough manner and unwavering toughness hes about as sentimental as one of the tunnel rats the classic example of your worst enemy or your best friend. When he crushes the skull of a young German soldier we understand hes not a man ever to let conscience get in the way of survival.Though the conclusion is foregone Canadian screenwriter David F. Shamoons script manages to extract suspense out of Poldeks ruthless calculating nature More than halfway through the film it still seems plausible that hell sell out his Jews for the reward money and to save his own family. That even this tough nut can crack makes the story that much more moving and unexpectedly even hopeful.In DarknessDirected by Agnieszka HollandWritten by David F.

Comments click to enlarge Edge of Darkness Video 2010 Perennially vengeful Mel Gibson stars as a widowed Boston police detective whose cute idealistic daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is shotgunned by masked bastards before his very eyes. Armed with Hollywoods most solemn warrant for payback he unravels a conspiracy that extends to the highest levels of tedium and confusion. This was based on a British miniseries and the narrative convolutions made me wonder if screenwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell felt obliged to cram all six episodes worth of talk and plot into 117 minutes. Martin Campbell directed displaying none of the flair that made his Casino Royale such a hoot; with Danny Huston as a corporate weasel and Ray Winstone as a cryptic black ops expert who serves as Gibsons Deep Throat.

Sanders Caterina Scorsone Gbenga Akinnagbe Bojana Novakovic Director Martin Campbell Running time 147 Release Opened Jan 29 2010  Editorial Review Revenge fantasy Gibson vs. goonsBy Michael OSullivanFriday Jan. 29 2010Theres nothing especially edgy or dark or darkly edgy or even particularly twilit about ""Edge of Darkness"" at least as thrillers go. Its title is one of those generic labels like ""Compelling Evidence"" or ""Deadly Affair"" that only hint at whats inside without telling you the exact flavor or nutritional content.Heres what youll find an elaborate -- and not entirely unsatisfying -- revenge fantasy about a cop who sets out to find his daughters killer after shes gunned down in front of him on his front porch.Did I say elaborate? Perhaps painstaking is more like it. Like its hero Boston police detective Tom Craven (Mel Gibson) ""Edge of Darkness"" is a methodical and workmanlike thing. After only about five minutes of mourning for his dead child (Bojana Novakovic) Craven washes the blood off his face and gets down to business running through the list of his daughter Emmas contacts from her cellphone and systematically contacting them one by one by one. Soon hes unearthed a vast -- okay medium-size -- cabal conspiracy and coverup involving Emmas defense-contractor employer (Danny Huston) a U.S. senator (Damian Young) and assorted suits goons shysters heavies fixers and hired guns.Like one of those highway machines that plows down the middle of the road painting white lines Craven goes after each of them with single-minded focus alternately punching questioning shooting threatening bashing over the head and cajoling in his quest for justice. Or something.Who is he someone asks. ""Im the guy with nothing to lose who doesnt give a [expletive]"" Craven answers. (After Gibson uttered that line at a recent critics screening all you could hear was the sound of 40 pens scribbling in the dark.)Surprisingly things arent quite so plodding as they sound. Yes we pretty much know as soon as we meet them who the bad guys are and who the good guys are.With one exception. As a mysterious man named Jedburgh who shows up knowing a little about everything yet doesnt do much of anything Ray Winstone will keep you guessing as to his characters allegiance until the very end. Hes the best -- and most ambiguous -- thing about the film.Meanwhile the more Craven digs the less mystery remains until the movie is less thriller than foregone conclusion. Let me see has Craven shot everyone yet? As with ""The Lovely Bones"" we sort of know -- or at least can guess -- whodunit early on. Theres even a ghost of the dead daughter here too gently guiding and talking to Dad from beyond the grave.But filmmaker Martin Campbell -- director of the 2006 ""Casino Royale"" remake along with the 1985 British miniseries on which ""Edge of Darkness"" is based -- has a flair for surprise. Even if the surprises are mainly of the car-speeding-out-of-nowhere variety.The movie isnt exactly full of twists and turns but neither is it a long hard slog. As Cravens dogged and (mostly) decent hero whos not above bending the law and jumping out of bathroom windows when being pursued by thugs Gibson makes suffering -- his own not other peoples -- appear well kind of fun. Like Campbell he appears to take pride in well-made cheese. It aint art but it serves its purpose.Contains strong bloody violence and foul language.

Edge of Darkness Mel Gibson returns with edgy role | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEdge of Darkness Mel Gibson returns with edgy roleIts been eight years since weve seen Mel Gibson in front of the camera in a major starring role instead of behind of it as director/producer.Mel Gibson left plays Thomas Craven and Shawn Roberts is Burnham in Edge of Darkness.  (MELINDA SUE GORDON PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. Jan. 29 2010  Starring Mel Gibson Ray Winstone and Shawn Roberts. Directed by Martin Campbell. 126 minutes. At major theatres. RIts been eight years since weve seen Mel Gibson in front of the camera in a major starring role instead of behind of it as director/producer.Article Continued BelowIn the interim Gibsons public image has taken a seismic battering over drunken anti-Semitic slurs and the very public desertion of his long-time spouse for a much younger woman.So whether he likes it or not Gibson comes into his latest film Edge of Darkness with a lot of baggage and facing the real prospect of antipathy from once-adoring fans and jaded film critics.The vehicle in which Gibson has chosen to return to acting has the kind of tired formulaic premise - a rogue father bent on revenge - which only adds to the high-risk gambit for a major box office name whose star has been so badly tarnished by personal missteps and misdeeds.But Edge of Darkness has a couple of things going for it that contribute towards Gibsons redemption at least on the silver screen.First Gibson demonstrates once again that he really can act as he demonstrates in his portrayal of Thomas Craven a veteran cop and widower with little left to lose following his only daughters brutal murder.No longer quite so movie star handsome Gibsons deeply lined features and thinning mane complement a performance that is finely tuned and textured - mournful cunning determined and explosive with rage.The second factor is the script itself a darkly taut and intricate political thriller by screenwriter William Monahan.Revised from a six-part BBC miniseries of the same title of more than 20 years past Monahan has thoroughly modernized the story setting it in post-911 America where the shadowy world of high-level intrigue and betrayal he creates evokes such an air of plausibility its sure to unleash a deep sense of unease and paranoia.Martin Campbell who directed the original BBC miniseries draws solid and intense performances throughout from the supporting cast. The versatile British actor Ray Winstone is particularly fine as a veteran spook and fixer brought in to help orchestrate a massive cover-up a worldly literate man whose lifetime of moral ambiguity is put to a final test.Despite its nearly two-hour running time Edge of Darkness never feels padded or drawn out thanks to Campbells breakneck pace a surfeit of nasty villains and a plot filled with plenty of unforeseen twists and turns. With minimal sentimentality its a dark harrowing and satisfying journey.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 29 2010 1201 a.m. ET Mel Gibson is a cop trying to avenge his beloved daughters violent death in ""Edge of Darkness"" an action thriller based on a 1985 miniseries produced by the BBC. In fairness the film is what its Hollywood producers meant it to be a serviceable star vehicle for Mr. Gibson who hasnt had a starring role since the 2002 ""Signs"" and an efficient machine for emotional arousal; you cant watch the fathers desperate quest without sharing some measure of his grief. For those whove seen the miniseries however being completely fair to this relentless by-the-numbers conflation is probably impossible ""Edge of Darkness"" was one of the most enthralling intricate and genuinely thrilling productions in the history of the small screen. The big-screen version--directed by Martin Campbell who did the original--offers an example of why the studios numbers often add up and why at the same time so many of todays Hollywood movies leave us cool if not downright cold. The story remains roughly the same though the setting is now Boston and its environs rather than London and the English countryside. Thomas Craven a veteran homicide detective and a widower living alone welcomes Emma his only child home for a brief vacation. When shes shot to death in his presence outside his house--Im not revealing anything that isnt highlighted in the trailer--he first assumes that the lone gunman meant to kill him then finds reasons to think otherwise. As before Craven carries on frequent conversations with Emma after her death. In the original his flashback visions of her as a child and a young woman were affecting; here theyre cloying and manipulative. As before Cravens investigations lead him to discover a labyrinth of political intrigue shadowy alliances and a planet-threatening plot. Yet specifics have been smudged in the interest of simplicity. In the original which took place during the turbulent tenure of Margaret Thatcher Emma was part of a sizable movement protesting the spread of nuclear power. In the film shes a young physicist and a whistle-blower at a giant corporation thats ostensibly working on fusion power yet the update feels perfunctory and unconvincing. (Are we really supposed to believe that a sizable movement is trying to ban all military research in Massachusetts?) Secondary characters have either been turned into caricatures (a lizardly U.S. senator an oily CEO) or trivialized into genre stereotypes. Darius Jedburgh the wondrously flamboyant CIA operative played in 1985 by Joe Don Baker was a proud Texan who wore a Stetson hat and drove a white Rolls Royce. He has become a sinister British whisperer played monotonously by Ray Winstone. It took time to understand which side the first Jedburgh was on but the miniseries had the luxury of five hours in which to sort everything out and the rationale for his shifting loyalties proved to be a chilling lesson in the vagaries of foreign policy. The loyalties of the current Jedburgh are as bewildering as the man himself is banal. Youre more than willing to believe him when he tells Craven with a wink and a nod that hes ""been making things unintelligible for 30 years."" Still secondary characters dont matter much to industrial enterprises like this new ""Edge of Darkness."" Theyre only there for the hero to push against in what amounts to monodrama--one man against the world. And this anguished cop does push--remorselessly and violently in the spirit of a classic Clint Eastwood vigilante. (An encounter with Emmas bleak boyfriend is the definition of gratuitous violence.) The new Craven as written by William Monahan and Andrew Bovell is nowhere near as smart as the old one written by the late Troy Kennedy Martin (and played by the late Bob Peck). Here again though a good mind doesnt matter as much as single-mindedness since the monodramas governing principle is monomania. Mr. Gibsons performance is certainly intense but the gleeful energy he once brought to such hits as ""Lethal Weapon""--or even to ""Conspiracy Theory"" an excellent flop--has turned toxic and his somber scourge is no fun at all. (Though I did enjoy Craven telling the despicable senator ""You better decide whether youre hangin on the cross or bangin in the nails."") In further fairness theres no way that this film could have risen to the level of its source material. For one thing a lots got to give when five hours are telescoped into two. And unlike Craven who refuses to play by the rules of society the filmmakers have subscribed to the increasingly rigid rules of an expensive studio feature in a global market Dont dilute conflict with nuance; dont risk losing the audiences attention for a single moment; dont risk alienating the audience with substance that may offend; dont dwell on substance of any kind at the expense of raw emotions. Cravens emotions are grief and rage. Mine was dismay. ENLARGE Steve Buscemi in Saint John of Las Vegas. IndieVest Pictures Saint John of Las Vegas In a better world than this one the independent film movement would provide reliable relief from the imperatives of studio production. Yet low-budget indie features can be just as disheartening as their big-bucks brethren. A case in point is ""Saint John of Las Vegas"" a ramshackle feature written and directed by Hue Rhodes. Steve Buscemi is John a compulsive gambler who leaves Las Vegas after many more downs than ups and takes an office job in an Albuquerque auto-insurance agency. Romany Malco is Virgil the firms fraud investigator and Peter Dinklage is the boss who sends both men out to investigate a questionable accident that may or may not have taken place near Vegas. Mr. Buscemi can be touching without trying and so he is; basset hounds have nothing on his hangdog demeanor. Were given to understand that John beats his gambling habit only through self-acceptance but the writing is semicoherent at best and the buddies of this meandering road trip are not only mismatched but dislikable. The first-time filmmaker displays an affection for the bizarre and picaresque. Among the characters encountered by John and Virgil are a stripper in a wheelchair a militant nudist and at a tacky carnival a human torch who is suffering from some sort of burnout. Whats most bizarre though is the apparent absence of direction. Actors intone their lines without energy or inflection faces go slack scenes drift toward vague conclusions. Giles Nuttgens cinematography on the other hand is first-rate from start to finish. It makes the movie look like a movie. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Pennies From Heaven (1978) Not the 1981 feature which starred Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters and was stirring in its own right but the magnificent miniseries with Bob Hoskins as Arthur Parker a sheet-music salesman struggling to make a living in 1930s England. Revolutionary in its use of music--Arthur and others in his life give voice to their deepest longings through lip-synched songs of the Depression era--the series was written by the late Dennis Potter and directed by Piers Haggard. Gemma Craven is Arthurs repressed wife Joan and Cheryl Campbell is Eileen the shy school teacher with whom he falls in love. The Singing Detective (1986) Not the 2003 feature an ill-conceived affair in which Mel Gibson had a role but the six-hour masterpiece that was broadcast by the BBC. Many people consider this the greatest series ever to appear on TV. Written by Dennis Potter and directed by Jon Amiel its a free-form drama about a mystery writer played by Michael Gambon who creates hallucinatory worlds--and explores his tortured past--while lying paralyzed by acute psoriasis in an English hospital. Once again popular songs are mimed at unexpected moments by a cast that includes Patrick Malahide Joanne Whalley and Bill Paterson. The Wire (2002-08) Inexplicably and inexpressibly remarkable David Simons HBO series set in Baltimore is nothing less than the portrait of an American city and its institutions--police courts unions schools press and yes criminal gangs which are not only institutionalized but persistently dominant. The level of violence can be shocking the portrait is grim in its depiction of rampant dysfunction and certain stretches of dialogue could use subtitles--theres been no softening of ghetto-speak But ""The Wire"" is a showcase of incisive writing flawless acting and inspired performance. Its brilliant in ways that contemporary feature films seldom approach let alone match. --Joe Morgenstern Find television listings at LocateTV.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 28 2010 534 PM Title Edge of Darkness ""Im a guy with nothing to lose"" growls Mel Gibson?agt;??s character in ""Edge of Darkness"" and the same could be said about the actor himself. On the other hand while Gibson has fallen pretty low personally that means an awful lot is riding on his professional resurrection.Its clear he has planned this comeback very carefully too. Both fast-moving and forgettable ""Darkness"" is just good enough to be embraced by Friday night audiences especially in Januarys cultural void. And though the movie features the brutal bursts of violence Gibson loves his role positions him as a righteous martyr whos impossible to criticize. Gibson plays Boston detective Tom Craven a loving father whose daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) returns home with a disturbing secret. Just as shes about to confess shes shot in the chest in full view of her horrified father. He makes it his mission to track down her killer a noble goal that becomes increasingly dangerous. Emma was working for a corporation designed to oversee the countrys nuclear stockpile but she believed they were doing far more than that. As Tom digs deeper he comes up against the companys slick CEO (Danny Huston) a sleazy senator (Damian Young) and a slippery government operator (a standout Ray Winstone). Gibson hasnt had a starring role in seven years but he has no trouble returning to work. That he looks a little wearier and a lot older simply adds to his characters pathos. And while the script -- based on a 1985 British miniseries -- is needlessly convoluted it barely matters since Gibson stands so firmly at the center of it all.Most popcorn movies are designed to make us forget our troubles; this one is designed to make us forget his. It may work too In Hollywood all is forgiven if you can deliver the goods. On-screen at least theres little difference between this Gibson and the one we remember from earlier films like ""Ransom"" and ""Payback.""

Pictures Mel Gibson stars as Thomas Craven a Boston police detective trying to solve the mystery of daughter Emmas death. ABOUT THE MOVIEEdge of Darkness    out of four Stars Mel Gibson Ray Winstone Danny Huston Bojana NovakovicDirector Martin CampbellDistributor Warner Bros. Rating R for strong bloody violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Mel Gibson is back to doing what he does best. For his return to acting after seven years off he chose wisely with the taut thriller Edge of Darkness. With Gibsons tired fiftyish countenance his continuing affinity for violent action films might seem incongruous. SEE A CLIP Mel Gibson on a mission But his receding hairline and lined forehead give him just the right careworn manner for the role of Thomas Craven a police detective whose only passion in life is Emma (Bojana Novakovic) the 24-year-old daughter he raised alone. He ably projects experience sadness and an astute strength. It works well for his part as a veteran Boston detective who must solve the mystery of his daughters death. Not only is Edge of Darkness Gibsons best work in a decade -- a big improvement over such drivel as What Women Want-- it is a well-crafted thriller. This tense tale of a fathers love for his daughter and his blinding sense of revenge artfully blends emotion and suspense. As it evolves into a complicated and slightly familiar crime and political thriller the film loses steam. Still its pacing is slowly captivating then suddenly unnerving. Craven embarks on a mission to unravel secrets in his daughters professional and personal life. We get only hints in the first few scenes amplified by flashbacks of her childhood. Thomas is clearly single and there is no reference to Emmas mother. Somehow this seems more honest than throwing a flashback to explain away a mothers absence. From the earliest frames when Thomas goes to meet Emma at the train station we find ourselves tensing for impending trouble. As soon as Emma appears looking green around the gills and dismissing it with ""Im just tired I think I got a bug"" its clear something much worse is afoot. Its a testament to director Martin Campbells expertise that when something does happen it still comes as a shock. Campbell has adapted his own acclaimed 1985 BBC miniseries. The director of Casino Royale he knows how to blend action and suspense. Though he doesnt stint on cruelty Campbell also doesnt shy from gentle moments. Casual brutality mingles with heartbreaking reminiscences. Gibsons restrained performance as a grieving father and sharp detective is top-notch but the films story wavers in its effectiveness. Its an anti-corporate anti-government screed with such evils as covert nukes and terrorism that tap into our collective paranoia. But plot holes crop up and motivational murkiness undercuts some of the conspiracy that comes to light. Still strong performances --Ray Winstone as a mysterious security consultant and Danny Hustons slimy corporate honcho -- compensate for plot weaknesses. Though the experience is nerve-racking and cathartic under Campbells skilled direction musings on family and grief and Gibsons intense but subtle performance stay with us longest.

Maria Schrader as Paulina Chiger in ""In Darkness."" Photo Jasmin Marla Dichant Sony Pictures Classics In Darkness review Humanity rises from depths 1 / 4 Back to Gallery In Darkness Drama. Starring Robert Wieckiewicz and Benno Furmann. Directed by Agnieszka Holland. In Polish German and Ukrainian with English subtitles. (R. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To give the highest recommendation to a Holocaust movie is to anticipate a certain resistance in the reader. Such resistance is understandable. One might think that years and years of seeing Holocaust movies would create an immunity a point at which you can feel no more. But in fact it works the other way. The more you see the worse it gets so that at the beginning of ""In Darkness"" watching the Nazis march naked Polish women into the woods toward their own mass grave I just didnt want to go there again. But ""In Darkness"" is an extraordinary movie and somehow good art creates its own uplift. This Agnieszka Holland film rises to its subject so that the overall experience of it is far from dispiriting. Polands candidate for the best foreign film Oscar - it has a real chance of winning on Sunday - deals with real-life events in the city of Lvov in the last year of the German occupation. Its a gripping piece of history and also an exploration into the mysteries of the human soul. The mysterious soul in question is that of Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz) a Polish Christian who works as a sewer worker but augments his income with shady deals and thievery. Socha is nice enough to his wife and daughter but there is no way to call him a nice guy. One day a group of Jews comes to him and asks for his help because he knows the sewers better than anybody and he can hide them there. He agrees but for a price. He has no apparent human sympathy and at first even considers double-crossing them. But something happens inside Socha - and this is a big part of what makes ""In Darkness"" so effective and truthful The change in him is never stated in an overt way. Nor is there some Movie Moment of transition in which he goes from mercenary to compassionate. Rather we just watch as his life becomes increasingly taken up with bringing food and provisions to the Jews in hiding despite considerable personal risk. We see the change in him expressed in action and in hints just hints in Wieckiewiczs wonderful performance that there are hidden depths here. The ""darkness"" of the title might easily describe the human soul and its where much of the movie takes place. Physically much of the movie takes place in the sewers (with part of the movie filmed in an actual sewer) and though the frame is dark the setting is vivid - you can almost smell it and feel the damp. If Socha isnt all bad the Jews are not especially virtuous. They are people under extreme stress each one handling it differently some worse than others not one Gandhi in the bunch. The spectacle is not of horrible things happening to good people but of horrible things happening to regular people - thats closer to home and more unsettling. And as they bicker underground atrocities are taking place above. Holland never loses track of the grand movements but shes at her most brilliant finding the subtleties of interaction in David F. Shamoons screenplay - the strange look for example that crosses Sochas eyes when he talks with his Nazi friend a Ukrainian who has found a place in Hitlers army. Perhaps the mystery of Sochas soul the reason he risked everything resided to a large part in simple orneriness an unwillingness to be told what to do. This may in the end be Hollands point though if you see ""In Darkness"" you might very well come up with something different Its possible to have courage without humanity. But its impossible to have humanity without courage.

"In Darkness review A Holocaust film of shadows and fog |       NJ.com comments In Darkness review A Holocaust film of shadows and fog Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 08 2011 at 1113 PM View/Post Comments The movie is called ""In Darkness"" and - being the true story of Polish Jews who escaped the Holocaust by hiding in Polish sewers for over a year - the title if certainly factually correct. Philosophically too. Because the film says when it comes to what people are really like - what their motives truly are and how they rise to or run away from challenges - all of us are truly in the dark. We may think we know everything when the film begins. Weve certainly seen enough Holocaust films by now. The Polish Jews who have just escaped to a Lvov sewer are heroes; the Polish Catholic (and occasional thief) who discovers them is a villain. Except when you shine a light on characters you see some surprising angles. Certainly the refugees from the ghetto are survivors - but they are also purely human. And that means that they are full of fear and lust and hunger too sometimes noble sometimes petty. And the man who discovers them - yes hes crude and uneducated and was fed prejudice with his daily bread. But that doesnt mean that he cant act with honor too or with courage. Because as his wife sometimes reminds him we are all human beings. And that means we carry contradictions within us. There are some striking images here (especially one ghostly one of naked women driven sobbing through the dark woods by soldiers). Better though are the simple gritty details of how life goes on - always - even under the worst of circumstances. (SONY PICTURES CLASSICS)Robert Wieckiewicz has an underground secret in ""In Darkness."" Crowded together in a rat-infested sewer these people still pray still play still celebrate Passover. Still curse and connive too and find time for furtive affairs. Robert Wieckiewicz - a Polish actor whose films have gotten little exposure here - is wonderful as the complicated Leopold Socha the man who becomes a ""Righteous Gentile"" in spite of himself. And Benno Furmann excellent in the mountaineering drama ""North Face"" is superb as the courageous Mundek Margulies - who in an extraordinary act actually breaks into a concentration camp just to make sure someones relative is still alive. Veteran director Agnieszka Holland - whose credits range from ""Europa Europa"" to episodes of ""The Wire"" - doesnt always have this sprawling material under control. The relationships among the Jewish characters arent clear at first and the pacing could be sharper; the (understandably) underlit photography doesnt help. But as many Holocaust stories as weve seen this one still has a fresh and important lesson about heroism - and how it has the habit of springing from some all-too-human places. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence sexual situations and nudity. In Darkness (R) Sony Pictures Classics (145 min.) Directed by Agnieszka Holland. With Robert Wieckiewicz Benno Furmann. In Polish German Yiddish Hebrew and Ukrainian with English subtitles. Now playing in New York for a one-week Oscar run; opens wider Jan. 27).

Pictures) By Sam Allis Globe Staff / January 29 2010 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""Edge of Darkness will be remembered as the vehicle for Mel Gibsons return to the screen after seven years. Based on an award-winning BBC television miniseries from 1985 it reminds us of his star power - and his limitations.An actor who can carry a movie is nothing to dismiss. Robert Redford comes to mind. Yet like Redford soaring performances elude Gibson. He remains a pro who delivers what hes got in him. Its nice to see him on the screen again however wacko his behavior has been off it.Shot in and around Boston by director Martin Campbell who also directed the six-part series the movie is a long complicated affair that has its moments but suffers from an overwrought plot.On one level ""Edge of Darkness fits squarely in the genre of vigilante movies including Gibsons earlier ""Payback as well as ""Death Wish where Charles Bronson plays a quiet architect who after his wife is murdered starts killing criminals on the streets of New York. ""Hard To Kill which came out in 1990 brought us Steven Seagal pre-hairpiece and beluga waistline as a Chicago detective whose wife is murdered.Unlike the protagonists in those films Gibsons character struggles with his need for revenge in ""Edge of Darkness. He kills without panache. Nothing comes easy. He is neither a force of nature nor a wizard detective. He fights to maintain his mental stability in the face of emotional collapse. (His Boston accent is tragic but no worse than those of countless other actors.)Gibson is Tom Craven a veteran Boston homicide detective and single father whose daughter Emma is murdered on the front steps of his house in blue-collar Roslindale. (Roslindale is a nice touch sited by Boston-bred screenwriter William Monahan who won an Oscar for ""The Departed and cowrote this movie.)Emma played competently by Serbian-born actress Bojana Novakovic returns home from her job as a research trainee at a top-secret nuclear facility that has scads of government contracts. Craven picks her up at the airport and she is vomiting blood before she enters the house. There the bleeding gets worse. She collapses and her father rushes to take her to a hospital. As they leave someone in a passing SUV yells ""Craven and shoots her.Gibson gradually learns that he may not have been the target as he first assumed and spends the rest of the movie tracking down and ultimately dispatching those responsible for her death.Despite his daughters MIT degree Craven never knew she worked in such a facility. He goes through her personal effects and finds her employee badge and a gun among other things. He visits her boyfriend in fear for his life for good reason and then the facility where he confronts the corrupt oleaginous head of the place played beautifully by Danny Huston who owns this kind of role. By then Craven knows hes being followed. The men in the dark suits try repeatedly to kill him while one after another the people he talks to are murdered.In good conscience I cannot divulge any more of the plot which culminates in a bizarre ending. You wish the free-floating fear that so successfully enveloped the BBC series had been better captured here.What I can say is that the movie revolves in part around an environmental group trying to expose illegal activities going on at the nuclear facility. A shadowy government operative named Darius Jedburgh played by the redoubtable Ray Winstone is on the scene too. We dont know much about him other than he is a ""cleaner brought in by someone to tidy things up as the killings mount. (Jean Reno was a memorable ""nettoyeur French for ""cleaner in ""La Femme Nikita.)The movies weaknesses include the overuse of grainy flashbacks of Cravens daughter as a child and the conversations he has with her after she is gone. Both are tremendously moving ideas but eventually succumb to bathos from repetition.Far better are the scenes in which we watch the detective show a stone-cold stare as he questions people. The lines in Gibsons face speak to the decades he has spent doing this. He is a real cop doing the legwork real cops do. Only this time it involves his daughter and thats shattering.Gibson returns to the screen stripped of his glamour. Its a smart way to go. His performance in ""Edge of Darkness is purely adult no bells and whistles no vamping. Hed be wise to pursue these kinds of roles in the future.Sam Allis can be reached at allisglobe.com.

Its a harrowing Holocaust tale but one that speaks to humankinds capacity to endure to fight on in the face of terrible cruelty. More about In Darkness >> Adapted from Robert Marshalls book In the Sewers of Lvov Hollands technically impressive film offers a grueling account of the true story of a group of Jews who spent 14 months living in a rat-infested underground sewer dark damp and redolent of human excrement. These were not heroes but ordinary citizens - flawed afraid ungenerous - who forced from the ghettos as the Nazis lined up Jews for the work camps and the death camps fled to the sewers instead. In Darkness is also pivotally the story of a city sewer worker Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz). A married man a Gentile whose moral core seems fairly coreless at first Socha takes money to harbor the Jews - guiding them to hideouts bringing food and supplies. It was a mercernary act not a missionary one but over the course of the year and two months that he served as their secret guardian Socha undergoes his own transformation. Like many of his Polish brethren he felt antipathy toward the folks with the stars sewn on their clothes living in the ghetto. But as he comes to know them playing with the children and befriending Mundek (Benno Furmann) a brawny thug who insists on returning aboveground to look for a missing girl Socha puts himself at risk sacrificing his own safety and standing in the community to help the frightened fugitives. Holland shooting in confined spaces with little light elicits taut performances from a strong cast. The filmmaker whose career took off with a very different sort of Holocaust film 1990s Oscar-nominated Europa Europa understands that most of these stories arrive at a point of unspeakable incomprehensible horror. These moments force us to ask questions about ourselves our existence about the nature of man and the nature of God - or if there is a God at all. In Darkness asks these questions. The answers are troubling inspiring frightening true. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at www.philly.com/onmovies.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Mel Gibson has been away from the cameras for a while and he appears a little scuffed up in Edge Of Darkness his first starring role since Signs in 2002. He looks greyer and craggier than before and his stiff movements make it easy to forget his former athletic grace. Whatever the source of that wear and tear it at least helps him look the part in this revenge thriller which casts him as a Boston cop looking for answers after seeing his daughter (Bojana Novakovic) gunned down on his own front porch. Director Martin Campbell adapting a well-regarded BBC miniseries he directed in 1985 goes further than merely failing to hide the ravages of time trouble and hard living. He puts his diminutive tough-guy star next to actors who tower over him in shots that subtly drive home the same point As often as weve seen Gibson get out of scrapes in the past his odds dont look so good this time. Those choices serve the film too which compels Gibson--sporting a thick occasionally believable Boston accent--to unravel a far-reaching conspiracy involving his daughters employer a private industrial concern overseen by a silky amoral Danny Huston whose character needs only a mute Korean manservant to qualify him for a supervillain license. With each lead Gibson follows he discovers hes taken on not a dragon but a many-headed hydra. Edge Of Darkness gathers all the elements of a smart politically resonant thriller but leaves them only half-assembled. That might partly be due to the need to compress a sprawling plot into a two-hour frame; a pattern of investigation interrogation exposition fisticuffs and repetition takes over the movie after a while. But its mostly because Gibson crowds out anyone and anything competing with the displays of righteous fury hes leaned on since Braveheart. In spite of attempts to make him seem vulnerable--which include a bunch of maudlin conversations with his characters dead daughter--this is really a movie about the power and grim pleasure taken by a man building up a static charge of rage as he searches for the right target. Huston Ray Winstone (playing a puppetmaster of puppetmasters) and other recognizable faces all do fine character work but Edge Of Darkness quickly devolves into another showcase for Gibsons snorting-bull act a routine he could happily have shelved during his time off.

In his first leading role since 2002 a notorious actor tries to rekindle his star wattage By Richard Corliss Monday Feb. 08 2010 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Related Top 10 Jesus Films Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Were deep into the new thriller Edge of Darkness. People are dying violently every few minutes; conspiracy theories are sprouting like kudzu. And Mel Gibson as a Boston cop trying to find his daughters killers tells somebody its the moment of truth. ""You had better decide"" he says ""whether youre hangin on the cross or bangin in the nails."" Ouch. Its a reminder that Gibson the movie star is also Gibson the director of the polarizing religious epic The Passion of the Christ in which his one onscreen appearance showed him driving the first nail into Jesus palm. In the three decades since Gibson first cruised the postapocalyptic outback as Mad Max hes forged a wayward career as one of Hollywoods top moneymakers. He fronted a couple of burly action-film franchises (three splendid Mad Max movies; four shoddy popular Lethal Weapons). Ten of his films earned more than 100 million from 1989 to 2002 back when that was real money. His Scots epic Braveheart won him Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. That was just Gibsons second film as director; his third The Passion of the Christ in 2004 was the all-time top-grossing film in both the R-rated and foreign-language (Aramaic if you recall) categories. (See the top 10 Jesus films.) Passion also made Gibson something of a pariah in Hollywood for what was perceived as the films blame-the-Jews sentiment. Gibson denied the charge. Two years later he was stopped for drunk driving; his arrest report states that ""Gibson yelled out The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Gibson then asked Are you a Jew?"" The officer was Jewish. Gibson got into an oddly similar tangle recently with Sam Rubin an entertainment reporter for the Los Angeles TV station KTLA. Rubin suggested to Gibson that some people think he should not have returned to acting ""because of ... the remarks that were attributed to you."" Not raising his voice but leaning in toward Rubin Gibson said ""That were attributed to me. That I didnt necessarily make. O.K.? But -- and I gather you have a dog in this fight ... You have a dog in this fight? Or are you being impartial?"" The implication was that if his interrogator was Jewish he must have been trying to nail Gibson. Rubin is Jewish. Aside from Mels Jewish problem he has the sizable challenge of rekindling his star wattage after being absent from leading roles since Signs in 2002. Edge of Darkness might seem just the vehicle for that mission. Based on an acclaimed BBC miniseries from 1985 with the same director at the helm (Martin Campbell who with Casino Royale rebooted the James Bond franchise) and with William Monahan the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Departed working on the script it focuses on a familiar Gibson character the haunted hero who solves problems by killing people. (See the top 10 James Bond gadgets.) Mourning SicknessIn modern movies when a father and daughter are shown in an affectionate relationship you know one of them has to die. Thomas Craven the cop is walking into his house with his 24-year-old daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) when she is gunned down. The official suspicion is that Craven was the target but he soon learns that she had been engaged in antinuclear espionage at Northmoor a nearby plant run by the usual oily CEO (Danny Huston). In streamlining the original shows cast of malefactors which included British and U.S. corporations and intelligence agencies trade unions and the IRA the movie reduces the story from a panoramic conspiracy to another one-guy-against-the-system thriller and Edge loses its political edge. Gibson who has always been an undervalued actor does a sturdy job as a grieving dad who still engages in conversations with his dead child; its almost a letdown when he puts aside his mourning sickness and spirals into melodrama. At 54 Gibson is aging interestingly with severe creases and sagging flesh. You look at him and think This guy should play Nixon -- another complex man of significant achievement with a debilitating belief that his enemies were bangin nails into him.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; edge-of-darkness ) Edge of Darkness (United Kingdom/United States 2010) January 27 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Considering the talent involved and the strength of the source material theres no way Edge of Darkness should have been this disappointing. Part of the problem is a direct result of condensation - theres no way to cram six hours of the dense mini-series upon which the movie is based into about 110 minutes without paying a penalty. More surprising however is the inconsistency of some of the production elements - acting dialogue direction - and these are delivered by seasoned veterans. Edge of Darkness has earned its January release date - this movie deserves to be dumped into theaters with little fanfare. The British mini-series which debuted on the BBC in 1985 comprised six episodes and was written by the late screenwriter Troy Kennedy Martin whose resume also lists such highly respected projects as Reilly Ace of Spies and Z-Cars. A tense convoluted Cold War series Edge of Darkness offered insurmountable challenges to adapters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell. The dialogue is often cheesy and their re-working of the story places it in a curious limbo between the incomprehensible and the obvious. When it comes to the more conventional murder-mystery aspects of the film the viewer is always too steps ahead. For example we know from the moment we first meet one secondary character that hes going to end up on the wrong side. The deeper aspect of the narrative which involves government-sponsored conspiracies is poorly explained despite frequent pauses for bouts of expository dialogue. Those expecting a testosterone rush are going to be disappointed. The movie has bursts of action but they are buffered by long tedious periods when not a lot happens. But at least we get that memorable one-liner ""Youd better decide whether youre hanging on the cross or banging in the nails"" Thomas Craven (Mel Gibson) is a lonely Boston police officer who dotes on his grown-up daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic). He keeps replaying old home movies of her as a little girl in his head. Hes delighted when she comes home for a stay but his excitement turns to concern when she becomes ill. As they leave for the hospital a masked gunman arrives at his doorstep and blows a hole through Emmas chest. Craven is devastated but determined to avenge his daughter. Common wisdom indicates Emmas death was a case of mistaken identity - that the real mark was Craven and the killer is an ex-con holding a grudge. Craven isnt so sure however. He learns that Emmas sickness was radiation poisoning and his questioning of her boss Jack Bennett (Danny Huston) enflames his suspicions. Meanwhile a shady government operative named Jedburgh (Ray Winstone) makes contact with Craven and lets him know that if hes going to pursue his investigation hes going to have to proceed outside of the law. The responsible parties will never be brought to justice in conventional ways. For Mel Gibson this represents an attempt at a comeback. His last starring role was eight years ago when he was among Hollywoods elite. Since then he has developed into a polarizing and controversial figure first for his direction of The Passion of the Christ then for the ugly incident in which a drunk and disorderly Gibson uttered a series of anti-Semitic slurs. Having stayed out of the spotlight for more than three years (his last involvement with any film was as the creative force behind Apocalypto) Gibson has elected to return to the screen by playing a familiar type a revenge-minded cop working outside of the law. Craven isnt Riggs without the wacky sense of humor however. Hes much closer to Porter the character from Payback. The difference is that Payback was solid popcorn entertainment - well-paced and drunk on adrenaline; Edge of Darkness is turgid and uneven. And as with a sports star who has returned to the game after a long layoff Gibson shows signs of rust. There are times when his trademark intensity emerges but other instances when he appears to be reading from cue-cards. Still he fares better than Danny Huston whose delivery of dialogue is so stiff its almost laughable. One of the movies pleasures is the work of Ray Winstone whose sinister character emerges from the shadows wreathed in mystery. Edge of Darkness works primarily when Winstone is on-screen and does so because the actor is hypnotic. As written Jedburgh is an inscrutable shell but Winstone makes him not only more human but also more dangerous. One senses that Edge of Darkness would have been significantly more compelling had the story focused less on Craven and more on Jedburgh. Director Martin Campbell is in an intriguing situation having been accorded the task of updating his own material (he helmed the mini-series). Perhaps Campbell is too close to the production to see its missteps but he never solves the riddle of how to smooth out the pacing and provide the dramatic momentum necessary to keep viewers invested. Campbell is a two-time Bond director having ushered in Pierce Brosnan with Goldeneye and performed the same task for Daniel Craig with Casino Royale and his finesse with action scenes is evident. However some of the less high-voltage material defeats him. There are times when events are presented with such awkwardness that the film almost plays as a parody. The first scene between Gibson and Huston seems like a filmed rehearsal. Occasionally it is possible to transform a long complex mini-series into a motion picture (Traffic being an example) but more often than not the result presents the cobbled-together feel of Edge of Darkness. With the material improperly focused the final product lacks momentum and direction. This is 2010s first big cinematic disappointment - instead of a tense tightly-plotted thriller were saddled with a lumbering misfire.

In Darkness Good Director Agnieszka Holland. Cast Robert Wieckiewicz Benno Furmann Agnieszka Grochowska. Rating R for violence disturbing images sexuality nudity and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. Director Agnieszka Hollands movie an Oscar nominee for best foreign film tells the true story of Leopold Socha who helped save a group of Jewish people hiding in sewers in the Nazi-occupied city of Lvov during World War II. (David F. Shamoon based his script on Robert Marshalls book ""In the Sewers of Lvov."") Ah some will say another story of the saintly gentile saving the Jew during the Holocaust. How many variations on ""Schindlers List"" do we need? That question has no real answer of course but if the stories are as moving and well-told as Hollands film one might say at least one more. For one thing Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz) is no saint. Hes also not a wealthy industrialist like Schindler. He is a Polish sewer worker and amateur thief whose actions initially are borne not of moral indignation but of greed. He and his co-worker Szczepek (Krzysztof Skonieczny) know every nook and cranny of the intricate sewer system offering them convenient underground travel from one place to the next loot in tow as well as a place to stow what they take. Socha a Catholic is hardly a Jewish sympathizer. But he is aware of the atrocities going on all around him -- while running through the woods he and Szczepek see soldiers herding a group of terrified naked women through the trees then killing them. Holland shoots the scene in a sickish blue the womens skin giving them the appearance that they are already dead. Degradations -- and worse -- occur on the streets every day. When Nazis begin liquidating Lvovs ghetto in force Socha sees opportunity in tragedy. He and Szczepek know that some Jews are using the sewers as an underground hiding place and that some of his friends and neighbors are making good money by turning them in. Socha decides that instead he will charge a group a weekly fee to harbor them and bring them food and supplies while keeping their whereabouts quiet. He tells his wife hes doing it for her and their daughter; shes not buying it and is terrified -- the Nazis hang 10 Poles in retaliation for the unsolved murder of a soldier so this is a dangerous game. Soon it will come as no surprise it becomes more than a game. Socha will warm to the people he is being paid to protect and will take several chances with his own life to prevent their discovery. Especially meddlesome is an old prison acquaintance turned officer in the Ukrainian militia (Michal Zurawski) who is constantly on the hunt for anyone harboring Jews. Eventually it is clear that Socha has created a genuine bond with the people who were paying him for safety. Socha is the protagonist of the film but Holland creates a dual reality that above ground and that below in the rat-infested sewers. The Jews living there make moving attempts at a normal life in the darkness (a darkness that while dramatically powerful makes it harder to get to know and relate to the characters residing there). Its like an alternate universe. A girl sings for the group. Affairs take place; one man cheats on his wife while she and their daughter lie a few feet away presumably sleeping. A child is born. And of course people die. So many people die in such horrific ways. Wieckiewicz is outstanding his open face expressing a full range of emotions often within the same scene sometimes within the same conversation. Is he a good man? Or is he a greedy man moved to do good things? ""In Darkness"" suggests both another layer of duality in Hollands captivating film. In Polish Ukrainian Yiddish and German with subtitles.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr POINT AND SHOOT Mel Gibson fires away in Edge of Darkness B Edge of Darkness Genre Drama Mystery and Thriller; Starring Mel Gibson Ray Winstone Danny Huston Caterina Scorsone; Director Martin Campbell; Author Andrew Bovell William Monahan; Release Date Wide 01/29/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 112; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 28 2010 -- 1200 AM EST The ability to get angry on screen -- to really light a fire with your fury -- has been a defining characteristic of more than a few great movie stars (Humphrey Bogart Jack Nicholson Clint Eastwood Russell Crowe). Its not a trait you really choose either; its one that chooses you. Mel Gibson was one of the chosen from the moment he first came to international prominence in Mad Max (1980). As Max the cop?turned?two-lane-blacktop vigilante he was a cocky kid in leather pants just enjoying the ride but when he cuffed a bad guy to an explosive handed him a hacksaw and said that hed have just enough time to saw through his own ankle Gibson established himself as a cold-eyed avenger who could bring an audiences blood to a righteous happy boil. Hes unleashed that rage countless times since in Braveheart and Ransom and the Lethal Weapon films; even his infamous tabloid tirade showed us the dark demons of a star whod made a point of revealing his demons on screen. So when you go to see Edge of Darkness the new political revenge thriller starring Gibson as a Boston cop investigating his daughters murder you know who youre really waiting to see Mad Mel. Gibson looks older now still lean and handsome but with cracked-leather skin and haunted eyes that give him a touch of Boris Karloff world-weariness. Early on Gibsons Tom Craven picks up his daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) at the train station and brings her to his home but something is wrong She keeps getting sick and when they walk out the door to go to a doctor a masked gunman blows her away. The authorities assume that the bullet was meant for her father but Craven a clean cop (he doesnt even drink) knows that it wasnt and he sets about uncovering the life of the daughter hed kept at arms length. Emma was a research assistant at Northmoor a privately owned nuclear facility that looks like a cross between MIT and a James Bond villains lair (the director Martin Campbell is the veteran Bond helmer who made Casino Royale and GoldenEye). Its the sort of place that cant be up to anything but dirty deeds done for maximum ? profit. Edge of Darkness is based on a British miniseries from 1985 (Campbell was its director) but as compressed and updated by screenwriters William Monahan (The Departed) and Andrew Bovell its just a conventional divertingly propulsive borderline boilerplate corporate-high-jinks thriller. Gibson speaks in a dry Boston accent and really gets the gruff blunt working-class Boston Irish tude behind those inflections. Every time he interrogates someone its a nifty self-contained face-off with Craven an instinctive tactician playing every suspect and witness just so. His daughters boyfriend (Shawn Roberts) who knows but wont say what she was up to needs to be slapped around a bit -- and so he is. The head of Northmoor played by Danny Huston with his trademark widows peak and amphibian leer (a more decadent echo of his father John Hustons) speaks in silky euphemisms as he and Gibson engage in tasty power stare-downs. With each new scene Cravens fuse burns a little shorter and hotter. Meeting the leader of Nightflower a cult of leftist agitators who broke into Northmoors top secret facility he asks the dude to take off his glasses then bashes him in the face. The efficiency of the brutality turns the moment into vicious comedy. Edge of Darkness has nervous whistle-blowers sleazy politicians out to protect their puppeteers and hitmen who drive an anonymous black van that might as well be marked ""The Hitmens Anonymous Black Van."" The picture also has Ray Winstone with his ironic Cockney civility as a sinister government cleanup artist so oblique about his loyalties that he often seems to be on the side of the people hes strong-arming. What the film doesnt have is a political revelation we give a fig about. The more that Edge of Darkness reveals about the Corruption of America the less it seems like anything but a conspiracy-of-the-week excuse to get Mel Gibson hot under the collar. His slow-burn fury keeps the movie going but not enough to invest us in any justice beyond payback.

Dont worry. War Horse Steven Spielbergs master blend of heartwarming artistry and entertainment is on the way. Meanwhile I fear too many people who cannot bear to endure one more film about the Holocaust will stay away from In Darkness the esteemed Polish director Agnieszka Hollands beautifully filmed sensitively acted and expertly written account of the true story of an anti-Semitic Roman Catholic who saved the lives of a dozen Jews hiding in the sewers of Nazi-occupied Poland in 1943. Its harrowing sometimes difficult to watch and wrenchingly moving to the point of tears. It is also brilliant. Do not miss it. The Nazis have begun their liquidation of Lvov randomly murdering Jews for the sport of it and trucking away thousands to concentration camps. Here is a time and place of torture and death where everyone steals from everyone else to stay alive and nobody can be trusted--especially a sour and burly hamhock of a sewer worker and petty thief named Leopold Socha. Between robberies he one day encountered some Polish Jews trying to escape from the ghetto before the Gestapo found them. For a price he showed them how to climb down from a hole in the street into the murk and foul-smelling slime of the underground tunnels. Living with rats eating a raw onion if they were lucky separating from their families giving birth to children surrounded by excrement they miraculously survived for 14 months. When their money ran out this accidental hero and his hardened calloused wife above ground somehow discovered a conscience they didnt know they had and protected their ""children of war"" from one near-fatal mishap after the next. In time the lives of dependants and reluctant saviors alike intertwine with such inspired candor and force that the ensemble cast literally takes on the souls of the characters. They are so real that after a while you forget you are watching actors at all. This is especially true of Robert Wieckiewicz an expressive and celebrated stage star in Poland who does wonders depicting the conflicting moral and religious instincts of Socha a tough emotionally detached sewer inspector and predatory crook whose criminal instinct for self-protection was betrayed by his new-found empathy for the disenfranchised. Only a handful of his Jews came through the ordeal alive but the real Socha has since been honored for his humanitarian efforts along with other brave Poles who altered human destiny by saving persecuted Jews from the gas chambers--specifically Oskar Schindler. Warsaw-born director Holland whose native epics about World War II such as Europa Europa have always surpassed her more commercial English-speaking work (The Secret Garden Washington Square) does such a thorough job depicting authenticity that the filth and degradation of the claustrophobic sewer eventually get to you. Theres an actual childbirth and the smothering of a baby I could not watch as well as a deathly flood that proves to be an act of betrayal. It is to the credit of a sound screenplay by David Shamoon that the film carefully balances the fear and selfishness of the victims without sentimentality. Neither Socha nor the Jews are angels. Some of them are despicable on both sides of the equation. Without overdoing the atrocities Ms. Holland attempts to illustrate the many cruel aspects of wars effects on its victims as well as its perpetrators. The title is apropos because most of the film submerges the viewer into a labyrinthine subterranean blackness that makes it difficult to share the experiences. We squint to watch them and struggle to feel the sexual and emotional attractions that keep their minds from closing the bridge to insanity. In Darkness is gloomy and hard to take for a running time of 145 minutes but its an important film related with deep conviction and uncompromising in its understanding of the remarkable things members of the human race have done--to for and against each other--in the wilderness of war. rreedobserver.com IN DARKNESS Running Time 145 minutes Written by David F.

The backstory might be the most interesting part of ""Edge of Darkness"" and no that doesnt refer to star Mel Gibsons somewhat checkered history. ""Casino Royale"" and ""Mask of Zorro"" helmsman Martin Campbell remakes a BAFTA award-bejeweled six-hour BBC miniseries he directed 25 years ago. Yet as with the recent ""State of Play"" the miniseries-to-movie transfor standing relatively limited action should also dampen box office prospects. Given his association with revenge plots both as a director and an actor Gibsons first star turn since ""Signs"" and ""We Were Soldiers"" in 2002 is well suited and finds him in fine form. Hes Thomas Craven a tough Boston cop who sees his only daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) gunned down in front of him early on. At first the assumption is that some enemy of Cravens must be responsible. Yet Emmas fidgety demeanor and bouts of nausea soon point to another more insidious culprit and a dense web of corruption -- one that involves the major government-connected corporation for which she worked headed by the imperious Jack Bennett (Danny Huston) from a sprawling hillside facility. Cravens search for answers also brings him into contact with a shadowy fixer named Jedburgh wryly played by Ray Winstone who seems content to let the cop pursue his mission so long as it doesnt interfere with his own. Haunted by visions of his daughter Craven assures him ""Im not gonna arrest anyone"" but that doesnt mean there wont be considerable collateral damage as he begins overturning rocks. Writers William Monahan (""The Departed"") and Andrew Bovell have done their best to update the Thatcher-era politics of the original but theyre hampered by the glut of similarly themed fare conceived during the intervening quarter-century. They also devote considerable time to conveying Cravens psychological torment which resonates emotionally but frankly bogs down amid the clue-sifting and revenge-seeking aspects of the plot. In terms of consistent visceral thrills ""Taken"" this isnt -- despite Campbells demonstrable flair for shooting action. Darkness"" is better served by its cast -- with Winstones world-weary conflicted character especially intriguing; its too bad there isnt time for more of him. Then again thats true of other supporting players as well whose motivations -- including Emmas -- would surely benefit from more detail. (One amusing footnote A senator in the movie is identified as a Republican from Massachusetts which might have sounded laughable were it not for the unexpected results in the recent election there.) Campbells topnotch production team yields predictably polished results but the directors decision to revisit the late Troy Kennedy Martins teleplay finally feels lacking. And while this is hardly the only mid-80s artifact being reanimated a generation later -- from the upcoming ""The A-Team"" to ABCs ""V"" revival -- ""Darkness"" returns with only its outlines intact while lacking much of its edge.
