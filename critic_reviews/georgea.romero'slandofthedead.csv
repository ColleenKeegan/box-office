Victims of violence are swiftly forgotten while undead monsters hardly inspire sympathy - unless youre a Romero walker that is in which case you may well have as much going for you as the chump whose jugular youve just torn out. Romeros fourth Dead movie comes even closer than its predecessors to offering a plea for zombie rights - a plea whose satirical application stretches from Americas underclass to the Iraqi insurgency. But while its subtext remains intriguing plotwise Land is the closest Romeros cycle has come to a conventional genre outing less survivalist screed than mission movie.The earth has been overrun by the cannibalistic living dead with humans restricted to areas such as the city sector run by Dennis Hoppers scenery-munching oligarch. Comprising a luxury skyscraper for the haves and slums and vice dens for the have-nots its kept stocked by raiding parties led by stoic heroic Riley (Simon Baker) and his souped-up tank-car. When bitterly aspirational raider Cholo (John Leguizamo) absconds in the tank Riley and a clutch of sidekicks are dispatched to recover it. On the action front Land exploits the (tired) tropes of John Carpenters 70s output more successfully than Carpenters own recent efforts and the gore quotient is as high as a US R certificate will allow. But the films most potent moments come with the walkers mobilisation as a figurative guilty conscience advancing on the citadel of plenty like an army of blank-eyed Banquos. The correlation with Americas left-behind was obvious even before Hurricane Katrina but now the sight of bedraggled hordes emerging from the water to a blasted city and an indifferent elite is more striking than ever.

"Land of the Dead Yuppies Add Zest to a Zombie Feast washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Land of the Dead Yuppies Add Zest to a Zombie Feast George Romeros iron-deficient zombie horde wades into Pittsburgh. (By Michael Gibson -- Universal Studios Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 24 2005 The dead are back but they dont want to party anymore. Now like everyone else they want to make a killing in real estate. Theyve got their eye on a fixer-upper too. ""Two million bdrms 750000 bthrms 3 riv vu."" Its called Pittsburgh. Thus ""George A. Romeros Land of the Dead"" in which the zombies take the Iron City. As Romero has it -- extrapolating into the near future from his famous (or infamous) zombie canon ""Night of the Living Dead"" ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"" -- the recently deceased all 6 billion of them have turned into shuffling flesh-eating bags of putrefying jellified flesh with really nasty hygiene teeth and wardrobes some even wearing white after Labor Day. Now theyve taken over the world except for the City of the Three Rivers. There a few remaining humans have barricaded themselves off from the universal death. But that society itself is riven Yuppies and haute-bourgie high-livers occupy a tower protected from reality by soldiers; this elite Romero lets us know in tropes that go back as far as De Mille is corrupt in its pleasure and its indifference. The streets meanwhile are a bazaar of prostitution weird haircuts and black markets filled with scalawags hustlers reformers and assorted other riffraff. In other words every movie future from ""Metropolis"" to ""Blade Runner."" Underneath the film is that grim old staple from oh what was it called you know that book I think it was . . . oh yeah the Bible. Its the one about Sodom and Gomorrah cities of sin and while we may weep crocodile tears at the fate of the nominal victims the secret pleasures of the tale are seeing those who got too much pleasure too cheaply being repaid by the righteous sword of vengeance. So on that primitive level ""George A. Romeros Land of the Dead"" could be said to satisfy Yes it shows us cannibal zombies eating yuppies. Along with gunsight camera footage and Wile E. Coyote cartoons I could watch that all day. Romero focuses on political squabbling in the last city. Between the corrupt rich and the hardscrabble poor are a class of freebooters one could only call the Cool. The Cool are the guys and gals who go out into the hinterlands and scavenge for necessities of life like Courvoisier and Band-Aids. They dress raffishly and have neat guns low-cut jeans and insouciant sexy manners; theyre the only ones who seem to have a lot of fun. The plot takes off when a dinner-jacketed dictator named Kaufman (played by a silky Dennis Hopper) betrays one of his scavengers Cholo (John Leguizamo) and orders him killed. Cholo hardened by years of mowing down zombies is too quick for his assassin however. He escapes with the citys only armored trailer truck and heads out of town where he threatens to use that truck -- helpfully its rocket-armed -- to blow up Pittsburgh if hes not paid off. So Kaufman sends a squad led by Riley (handsome-but-dull Simon Baker) to take him out. Meanwhile the dead have begun to notice things. Like the apes in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" they tumble to the idea of a tool except the tool they tumble to isnt a bone club its a Steyr AUG assault rifle that uses 5.56mm NATO ammunition. This is not good. Now theyre not just ugly hungry and dead but also heavily armed. They head to the three rivers and take another leap up the learning curve. It occurs to them We may stink and our heads may occasionally fall off but the one advantage we have is that we dont have to breathe. We can walk under the rivers. The movie isnt particularly scary. Its not about fear and it has almost no startles no long stalking scenes no ritualized fetishized deaths. It never reaches the squalid fury of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and it hasnt the sarcastic wit of ""Dawn of the Dead."" But it has something. It has zombies. Theyre weirdly impressive not just in the various states of decay that Romeros makeup artists are able to create. But that insistent shamble without panic without speed without focus remorseless stoical unstoppable even when those around them are being chopped down by gunfire. Theres something satisfying in the zombies progress almost poignant. Though they will eat us -- Romero loves to show us zombies feeding grossly on the only recently killed faces and fingers bright with blood -- theres nothing personal about it. They bear us no ill will they dont hate us or eat us from envy or malice; they just need to supplement their diets with iron and whats a man but a walking iron tablet? Romero also has got a lyrical streak as if theres a Japanese watercolorist lurking sensitively under the zombiemeister. Many of the images have a surprising beauty to them. One shot for example of the zombies on their ceaseless pointless nightwalks as glimpsed through a screen of fog and trees has an almost ethereal sense to it. And he can do things with the carnage that are more stunning than horrifying Two dead boys play tug-of-war with an arm until it splits slowly lengthwise and as repulsive as that sounds its oddly impressive even haunting on-screen. Too bad the plot held no surprises and the acting no revelations. No actor could be said to stand out and the movie never acquires much tension or momentum. The finale in which those walls come tumbling down and Pittsburgh is Sodomized is powerful but it has nothing to do with the drama weve been witnessing; its powerful as spectacle not story. George A. Romeros Land of the Dead (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme gore drug references and sexual innuendo.

But George A. Romeros Land of the Dead does have an ""old friends"" dimension that warms the heart as its familiar-looking zombies eat hearts -- plus other delicacies ripped from the bodies of screaming victims. Rivers cant stop them Big Daddy (Eugene Clark) leads his fellow zombies toward Fiddlers Green a city fortified against the undead. Universal Rivers This new graduating class of Dead are neither red- nor blue-state zombies but you do feel theyre at least marginally politicized. Certainly theyre disenfranchised In the supremely up- scale and mostly water-surrounded ""Fiddlers Green"" community string-puller Dennis Hopper sits in a penthouse office and smarmily looks down on practically everyone but especially these approaching marauders. What the water doesnt accomplish as a barricading device electric fences do. But with much of the continent already taken over by zombies you sense that Hopper isnt prone to hum the Rolling Stones Time Is on My Side. Much of the movie which is punctuated by a couple of good jolts and occasionally thrilling overhead shots deals with whether Hoppers Dead-combating mercenaries will or will not heed his increasingly hysterical orders. About the movie Land of the Dead    (out of four) Stars Simon Baker John Leguizamo Dennis Hopper Asia Argento Robert Joy Director George A. Romero Distributor Universal Running time 1 hour 20 minutes Rated R for pervasive strong violence and gore language brief sexuality and some drug use Opens Friday nationwide The mouthiest of these subordinates is played by John Leguizamo an actor who has just endured those blood-soaked grosses from The Honeymooners. And now like all the rest of Deads un-dead he always has to look over his shoulder because this is a movie where someone cant even rob a deserted liquor store without getting bitten by a zombie. For all Leguizamos efforts snob Hopper slurs his ethnicity. So you can imagine how potentate Hopper regards the zombies. Along for the ride are Australian actor Simon Baker Asia Argento (daughter of famed horror/thriller director Dario) and Robert Joy whose disfigured face here makes Al Pacinos Scarface look like someone who just needs a dab of Clearasil. On the zombie front we have a couple of marauders who carry musical instruments one in pom-pom cheerleader garb -- nice touch George -- and one played by my USA TODAY colleague Susan Wloszczyna who wrote a story about being an extra. Limiting Lands potency is its appearance just a year after being fabulously spoofed in Shaun of the Dead which battled it out with Team America World Police for the title of being 2004s funniest. Its fairly solid fun though without breaking any new ground just as Januarys remake of Assault on Precinct 13 was. As ever though its not much of a ""concessions"" movie -- and this at a time when exhibitors need all the help they can get.

(AP ... more Photo MICHAEL GIBSON Not dead yet Romeros zombies come back to life -- again. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Land of the Dead Horror. Starring Simon Baker John Leguizamo Dennis Hopper and Asia Argento. Directed by George A. Romero. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Has there ever been a better time for quality films about flesh-eating zombies? Just try stacking up the last three Tom Hanks movies against ""28 Days Later"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and last years ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake -- and watch Forrest run away with his decapitated head in his hands. All who follow George A. Romero owe their success to the godfather of zombie horror who has returned from whatever park hes been sleeping in for the past 20 years to release ""Land of the Dead."" Its packed with the same over-the-top gore and social satire that made his earlier films cult classics and the fright master still teaches his disciples some new tricks. Romero is the Brian Wilson of horror and those who followed his story realize the mere release of this film is a triumph of human spirit. The director invented the genre with his ultra-low-budget 1968 black-and-white film ""Night of the Living Dead"" and then perfected it with the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978. But his third movie in the series ""Day of the Dead"" was a bust. After a couple more non-zombie horror films failed between 1988 and 1993 the director couldnt find a major studio to let him in the door and his quest to create a fourth ""Dead"" film suffered setback after setback -- with the disappointments playing out on Internet fan sites to the point of embarrassment. It was only after the box office success of ""28 Days Later"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and the ""Dawn"" remake -- all zombie films made by Romero fans -- that Universal decided to give the 65-year-old a 17 million budget and this week Romero releases his first new zombie movie since 1985. ""Land of the Dead"" is worth the wait and dispels any fanboy concerns that the director was gone because he lost his mojo. Romero appears to have spent the past two decades doing nothing but thinking up crazy stuff for the fourth film in the series. The problems with the movie are limited to budget constraints and the incredible amounts of gratuitous carnage -- which will turn off 70 percent of the filmgoing public no matter how clever the writing. (Before you see this film take the following test Imagine the guy sitting next to you on BART snacking loudly on the severed leg of the old lady sitting across the aisle. Still want to go?) ""Land of the Dead"" begins a decade or two after the events of the last two movies with almost every human on the planet bitten by a zombie and turned into a lumbering homicidal corpse. ""When theres no more room in Hell"" the ""Dawn of the Dead"" poster explains ""the dead will walk the Earth ... ."" Romero is fascinated with the alternate reality he created and thinks up logical answers to questions about his zombie world. What would the zombies do after most of the humans are killed? They would return to their old lives staggering back to the filling stations where they worked and even getting the band back together. Which city would survive and how would the humans forage for food and medicine? Pittsburgh of course (the downtown is bordered by rivers) and the humans figure out that shooting fireworks in the air distracts the zombies enough for the living to walk around unnoticed. After ""Land"" takes its time establishing Romeros brave new world the conflict is set up with the slowly evolving zombies remembering how to use tools and the slum-dwelling leaders of the supply-collection team (Simon Baker and John Leguizamo as humans) clashing with the nattily dressed inhabitants of the citys biggest skyscraper. Yes among all the flying body parts and rotting bad guys feasting on steaming intestines theres a message here While Romero used the shopping mall in ""Dawn"" to satire materialism in the 1980s Romero lets the walking dead illustrate post-Sept. 11 paranoia and the expanding gap between the working class and the rich. The third act begins in the unfinished worksite of an upper-class housing development. The visuals dont disappoint -- ""The Evil Dead II"" makeup pro Greg Nicotero provides the decomposing flesh. Romeros dialogue is as sharp as ever. The best lines are saved for the post-apocalyptic Donald Trump figure played by Dennis Hopper who hasnt had this much fun since he was rigging commuter buses with explosives in ""Speed."" Leguizamo is also funny but its hard not to notice that the most memorable actors in the movie are zombies (expect big things in the future from Ross Sferrazza who plays ""Dead Trombone Player""). And although its clear early in the film that ""Land of the Dead"" doesnt have quite enough extras to fuel the directors vision of a world overrun by the dead the final 20 minutes fall apart mostly consisting of one big buildup without a worthy payoff. But dont let the fact that this movie cost about one-tenth of ""Batman Begins"" affect your judgments. The master is back and theres no shortage of exploding brain matter -- or fun -- to be had in the theaters this weekend. -- Advisory This film contains massive amounts of violence nearly unprecedented amounts of gore and a little profanity and nudity thrown in just for the heck of it. Seriously if youre squeamish dont see it.

"George A. Romeros Land of the Dead. Slate Sign In Sign Up George A. Romeros Land of the Dead. George A. Romeros Land of the Dead. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 23 2005 529 PM Undead Again George A. Romerosnew zombie epic. By David Edelstein The peasants really ARE revolting The heart sinks at the ""R"" rating for George A. Romeros new zombie flick Land of the Dead (Universal Pictures). Oh woe. Oh hold on Theres some mighty fine gut-munching here. Actually theres more than I need Gag me with a garden spade. True this zombie cannibalism isnt as anatomically exhaustive as it was in the last Romero Living Dead picture Day of the Dead (1985) but thats not necessarily a bad thing However flashy a showcase Day was for FX gruemeister Tom Savinis Vietnam flashbacks the disembowelments and partial beheadings were um overkill. No Land of the Dead might be dandier for its ""R"" rating. You could almost say it shows a new refinement. Savini didnt do the FX (although he has a cameo as a machete-wielding ghoul) but the splattery sight gags are very witty. The zombie with the flip-top noggin is an instant classic. And the sociopolitical subtext is good too. Advertisement Romero has quite the legacy to live up to. His Night of the Living Dead (1968) remains one of the masterpieces of the 60s distilling all the social and racial tensions of that era into one horrific 12-hour farmhouse siege. Authority has collapsed rifle-toting rednecks roam the countryside and the nuclear family is imploding Brother comes incestuously after sister; a little girl feasts on her mommys flesh. I saw it at age 12 and it didnt just scare the living crap out of me it turned my world inside out. The Me-Decade Dawn of the Dead (1978)was less devastating emotionally It featured zombies as the ultimate conformists/materialists converging on a mall out of a flickering memory of that American impulse to shop until they drop. (In this case they drop only after getting their brains blown out.) Dawn stretched its joke thin but it was brilliantly made and set a benchmark for onscreen hemorrhaging. It has been 20 years since Day of the Dead (1985)--which disappointed me at the time but looked much better on a recent re-viewing. Although hobbled by budget cuts Romero steered the saga into the 80s with an overweening military and a mad scientist who uses zombies for hideous experiments hoping to turn them into domestic servants (among other things). Land is the first Living Dead picture with name actors and its more formulaic than its predecessors; at times it feels like a hardboiled code-of-the-macho-man (and -woman) John Carpenter movie. But Romero still has a gift for expressive carnage and for turning zombies into something more than mindless festering plague-spreading viscera-chewers (not that they arent also mindless festering plague-spreading viscera-chewers). Advertisement Some years after the beginning of the plague the living dead still eat people but left to their own devices in deserted towns theyre struggling toward a higher consciousness forming bass-ackward social circles and even raging against the humans who like to blast and torture them for kicks. The most hateful villain is the supercapitalist Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who walls off wealthy white people in a high-rise condominium and keeps the underclass at bay distracted by sex and drugs and violent spectacle. Its a lefty paranoid fantasy complete with a largely ineffectual organizer who tries to stir up the proletariat. The leading man isnt African-American as he was in the first two films and came close to being in the third. But a black man is still Romeros social conscience. This time hes a zombie gas-station attendant--identified as ""Big Daddy"" in the credits and played by Eugene Clark--who moans and roars when he sees the slaughter of his fellow ghouls who are used for gleeful target practice by the bought-and-paid-for militia. Kaufmans henchman is Cholo (John Leguizamo) who delivers booze and takes out the human garbage and who dreams of making enough money to move into Kaufmans swanky condo. When told--in so many words--that hes not white enough he finds himself on the same side as the zombies. Broad yes but no one expects the politics in horror movies to be subtle. The hero Riley (Simon Baker) is both a stalwart man of action and a liberal who dreams of making a home in the Canadian wilderness. His sidekick Charlie (Robert Joy) is a burned simpleton--hes very much on the human-zombie continuum. Riley rescues Slack (Asia Argento--not coincidentally the daughter of Italys great gore maestro Dario) from a zombie cage where shes about to be eaten for the amusement of the rabble. Then the pair and a band of crack zombie-slayers take off after Cholo and his zombie-proof supertank known as ""Dead Reckoning."" They have to come back when hundreds of vindictive ghouls led by Big Daddy crash Kaufmans insular upper-class enclave and start slurping blue blood while the mogul makes like Fagin and tries to escape with his filthy lucre. The plotting isnt the thing here and neither is the acting--although Baker and Argento are charismatic Leguizamo is surprisingly compelling and Hopper for a change underplays amusingly. Romeros real gift is for urgent montage for claustrophobia and invasive terror and for images that transcend the splatter genre. In one scene Cholo sees on the video monitor in his tank a zombie pushing a skeletal lawnmower--maybe a Mexican gardener to some wealthy landowner in a former life. He blows the poor ghoul away with a kind of hatred reserved only for someone who cant manage to escape his cultural and economic disenfranchisement even in (un)death. (The killing is even more effective for being seen only on that little video screen.) The living dead are once again fascinating in the tatters of their previous lives Theyre cheerleaders punks crones side by side with people so rotted you cant quite tell what they were. In Land of the Dead humans have learned to distract them with fireworks. They send them up from their tank and the zombies stop in their tracks rapt like small children. As the ghouls evolve toward humanity and the humans toward ghouldom we can appreciate Romero for using horror to show us How We Live Now and How Were Living Dead now too.

"Land of the Dead All Guts No Glory washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Land of the Dead All Guts No Glory Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 24 2005 DYING as an old actor once said is easy. Comedy is hard. A similar sentiment might be expressed about ""George A. Romeros Land of the Dead"" the latest offering from the so-called father of the modern horror film revered for the 1968 zombie classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" and its sequels. Dying -- or in this case undying -- is easy. Scary is hard. Dont get me wrong. ""Land of the Dead"" is fairly intense. Intensely gory and violent that is as has come to be expected from the genre. Its just not very frightening. Not half as frightening as say last years ""Dawn of the Dead"" a remake of Romeros own 1978 film. That remake was not just gory but way scary funny and smartly self-aware with a touch of social critique and a deliciously pessimistic unhappy ending thrown in. Other than the opening shot of ""Land"" however in which Romeros camera pans past a battered diner sign pointing in the direction of ""Eats"" (get it?) theres no real joy in this undertaking which seems to prize grossing out the members of its audience above freaking them out. Set in a hypothetical present (an on-screen title identifies the time ominously as ""today"") ""Land"" takes place in a heavily fortified city where the last of the living have barricaded themselves against the sea of hungry zombies staggering around outside. Surrounded by rivers and an electrified fence the citizens of this community have been divided into two strata the elite who luxuriate in exclusive gated communities and high-rises and the riffraff who serve them a few of whom work as mercenary scavengers slipping out of the city under the cover of night in armored vehicles to collect food and supplies from outlying communities. Among these mercenaries are Cholo (John Leguizamo) an opportunistic hotshot who makes money on the side in the black market and as an errand boy for the citys heartless ruler Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) and Riley (Simon Baker) an idealist who dreams of one day getting away from all this to Canada (where presumably there are no zombies or if there are you cant tell them from the living). As you might expect the films central tension arises between these two opposites one of whom Cholo has gone off the reservation with the citys sole armored car a jury-rigged and missile-equipped tank known as Dead Reckoning. Cholos mad because Kaufman has not only refused to pay him but has also denied him an expensive condo reminding Cholo of his lower-class status. Riley along with a crew of (surprise) hard-boiled but lovable misfits (Asia Argento and Robert Joy) is sent by Kaufman to bring back Dead Reckoning before Cholo can turn its guns against the city. Meanwhile the zombies (or the ""stenches"" as they are called for obvious reasons) are evolving from a disorganized cretinous cannibalistic horde into a kind of disorganized cretinous cannibalistic army led by a quasi-sentient corpse-general named Big Daddy (Eugene Clark). At least thats the name stitched on his service station jumpsuit. No one actually calls him Big Daddy. I mean they may act like soldiers but theyre still zombies. Anyway Riley has to save the city from Cholos guns while remaining uneaten. Imagine the tension. No seriously youll have to imagine it because Romero just doesnt provide it. Blood and guts hes got in spades with on the one hand innumerable shots of zombies feasting on the stringy gooey drippy flesh of the living and on the other countless instances of Riley and others shooting the heads (and other body parts but mostly the heads) off the undead. As fans of the genre will recall a bullet to the brain is the only effective defense against zombies leading me to think that I must have taken one between the eyes without knowing it. All of which is not without a certain satisfaction. Its just that despite the mindless fun of the yuck factor theres no real emotional payoff here. (And no nausea doesnt count as an emotion.) The cast all of whom run around with looks of gravely theatrical seriousness on their faces seem less aware that theyre surrounded by zombies dead set on eating their characters alive than by movie cameras. Theyre not the last living human beings in the land of the dead but a bunch of actors in the ""Land of the Dead"" where everyone looks like Norman Batess mother and John Waters on a bad hair day. Romero himself seems to have forgotten one crucial thing too Making us sick to our stomachs by showing us a zombie snacking on a mans organs by pulling them up through his mouth is far easier -- and far less rewarding -- than reaching somewhere even deeper than that and scaring the bejesus out of us.

Romero may have been the originator of the modern zombie movie but at least with Land of the Dead he hasnt done much to refine it. The zombies are creepier looking than in the past and the gore is more hard-core but the story still boils down to the same old same old humans running away from hoards of slow-moving zombies. In a strange way the film feels like a hybrid of last years Dawn of the Dead remake crossed with Danny Boyles 28 Days Later. Theres a sense that Romero has run out of ideas and is recycling. (I felt the same way about the third installment of this four-movie series Day of the Dead.) The title although appropriate breaks the cycle. First we had Night of the Living Dead. Then it was Dawn of the Dead. Next Day of the Dead. Shouldnt this have been Twilight of the Dead? In an attempt to add a little variety to things Romero splits his focus between the dead stalking humans and humans screwing each other. This aspect of the movie reminds me of Ripleys quote from Aliens ""I dont know which species is worse. You dont see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage"" This time around the dead are starting to show signs of cooperation and low-level thought. Their leader a burly black zombie (Eugene Clark) employs a gun and a jackhammer. But the real villain of the piece is a Trump-like opportunist Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who has used the zombie takeover to amass wealth and power. He rules a zombie-free Pittsburgh from the top of a high-rise called Fiddlers Green. Privileged humans live there. Everyone else dwells in slums and shantytowns in the streets. The city is protected from the dead by water on three sides and an electrified fence on the fourth. Among Kaufmans henchmen are scavengers Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo). Their reasons for working for the boss are different. Riley wants to help people. Cholo is in it for the money. He hopes to buy his way into Fiddlers Green. Together these two go on raids of nearby cities and towns in an indestructible armored vehicle looking for supplies to bring home. For Riley canned goods and medicine are top of the list. For Cholo its liquor than he can sell in the streets. During the course of the movie both men have a falling out with their boss. Riley runs afoul of Kaufman when he saves a condemned woman (Asia Argento) from being mauled in a cage match with two zombies. Cholo loses his position when his social climbing aspirations mark him as a liability. Riley ends up hunting Cholo whos blackmailing Kaufman while the dead close in. Surprisingly theres little tension. The movie has a straightforward feel and you have a sense from the beginning whos going to live and whos going to die. There are a couple of good visceral scares but the relentlessness of the previous films has been replaced by a series of ""boo"" moments. At least theres one iconic scene the dead gradually rising from the river after they have discovered that water isnt a barrier. This is one of those scenes meant for posters and nightmares and its one of only a few instances when Land of the Dead strikes exactly the right chord. Dennis Hopper is well cast as the scheming Kaufman - the sadistic coward who isnt in as much control as he thinks he is. Simon Baker recently seen as the reporter in The Ring 2 is fine as Riley although the character comes across as a little too much of a do-gooder. John Leguizamo cuts back on his tendency to go over the top and become irritating. The result is a nicely controlled performance of a character who is more believable and less likeable than Riley. Asia Argento who may have been hired because of her name and reputation (shes the daughter of Italian horror master Dario Argento) gives a portrayal thats half tough-as-nails and half spacey. Its odd but it works. Eugene Clark doesnt get to do much other than look mean and make a lot of bellowing noises but he accomplishes that with aplomb. In the final analysis Land of the Dead comes across as generic. Despite being steeped in darkness it lacks the taut pacing and nerve-jangling suspense of 28 Days Later and doesnt have the tongue-in-cheek approach evident in Shaun of the Dead. Its got great makeup though. Credit Gregory Nicotero (who replaces Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Deads Tom Savini) for making the zombies more frightening than campy. Ultimately however copious gore and rotting flesh can only do so much for a movie and the lack of ambition in Romeros storyline is where Land of the Dead fails. The movie will appeal to those with a penchant for zombie flicks but is unlikely to reach further - not even to the broader ""general horror"" market. Its not startling or frightening enough.

Romero shows em how its done in ""Land of the Dead"" resurrecting his legendary franchise with top-flight visuals terrific genre smarts and tantalizing layers of implication. Nerve-shredding fourth installment may not fully reclaim the visceral or satirical impact of the writer-directors 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" but its still a satisfyingly splattery feast of guts and ideas.

George A. Romero shows em how its done in ""Land of the Dead"" resurrecting his legendary franchise with top-flight visuals terrific genre smarts and tantalizing layers of implication. Nerve-shredding fourth installment may not fully reclaim the visceral or satirical impact of the writer-directors 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" but its still a satisfyingly splattery feast of guts and ideas. Though Universal isnt flogging it half as aggressively as last years ""Dawn"" remake pic should grope its way to killer B.O. with no small help from Romero cultists whose devotion will be nothing short of zombielike. The horror maestro has come a long way since the third film in the cycle 1985s ""Day of the Dead"" and an even longer way since his seminal 1968 classic ""Night of the Living Dead."" This time around Romero is playing with bigger stars and a higher (though still modest) budget of about 15 million as well as a new shooting location (Toronto instead of his native Pittsburgh). That said ""Land"" is a tour de force of not only independent filmmaking but independent thinking rigorously worked out on all craft and technical levels yet enlivened by its twisted engagement with the real world. Romeros apocalyptic vision of an earth beset by endlessly self-perpetuating flesh-eaters remains as relevant and resonant as ever and this time hes even injected some not-so-subtle political invective into the proceedings. At one point Kaufman a corrupt gray-haired city official declares ""We dont negotiate with terrorists"" making this the second actioner in recent months after ""Star Wars Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" to lob a grenade in the direction of the White House. The city in question is one of humankinds last remaining holdouts an island metropolis surrounded by water and electric fences that keep out the walking undead. Perched in a high tower that dominates the skyline Kaufman (Dennis Hopper his brow furrowed with self-entitlement) owns everything and everyone in the exclusive community of Fiddlers Green advertised as the place ""where life goes on"" and where upper-class citizens are admitted only via waiting list. Those still outside on the streets meanwhile are in the early stages of revolution. Cholo one of several soldiers sent out on rescue missions to bring back food and supplies sets things in motion when Kaufman refuses to let him move into Fiddlers Green. The disgruntled mercenary (a hot-headed John Leguizamo) promptly hijacks Dead Reckoning an armored military vehicle that holds enough firepower to bomb out the city which he threatens to do unless Kaufman meets his demands. In response Kaufman commissions Cholos superior Riley (Simon Baker) to recover the stolen tank accompanied by sharpshooter sidekick Charlie (Robert Joy) and gold-hearted hooker Slack (Asia Argento putting a tough-talking spin on a familiar role). Tension between Riley and Cholo effectively fleshed out by Baker and especially Leguizamo reps only one of the storys intriguing contrasts. Both guys want out of a nightmare situation but where Riley hopes to start over away from civilization social-climbing Cholo wants to retreat inside into the ranks of the citys elite. Romero clearly has a lot on his mind working through issues of class segregation individualism and personal responsibility. As always the scenario eerily and amusingly mirrors the times Astute viewers will laugh at how the undead phenomenon has already become commercial fodder in the form of theme-park-style attractions and bloodsports. More chillingly the gleaming facade of Fiddlers Green implies an entire nation struggling and failing to lead normal lives in a war zone turning against itself in the process. Most suggestive of all are the zombies themselves who have become frighteningly resourceful and smart having learned to communicate as well as use tools and weapons. Unlike the trendy fast-moving denizens of the recent ""Dawn"" redux and ""28 Days Later"" Romeros walkers still shamble along slowly yet with an increasingly purposeful gait that makes them seem all the more human. They also look more realistically undead than ever thanks to pics ace makeup team (led by Greg Nicotero) and special contact lenses that lend their eyes a bluish otherworldly glaze. Pics ideas about continual evolution and advancement extend equally to the carnage which for most auds will be ""Lands"" ultimate test. And Romero rises to the occasion with a mastery discipline and gleeful sense of invention that shows just how far a slim budget can go given the right sensibility. Fans of the trademark spewing sausage-like intestines will be quite appeased; few will be prepared for the semi-decapitated zombie (emphasis on semi) or the ugly disadvantages of having a pierced navel (youve been warned). Romero has a way of at once honoring and updating modern horror-pic conventions relying more here on shock cuts (with super-sharp editing by Michael Doherty) and surprise zombie ambushes than the queasy claustrophobia that pervaded ""Night"" and ""Dawn."" The upshot happily is a similarly blissful sense of unease. Miroslaw Baszaks nuanced lensing finding endless varieties in a predominantly gray palette accentuates Arvinder Grewals chilly production design at every turn. Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimeks score is serviceably grim with repeated patterns that evoke the restless walk of the damned. George A.
