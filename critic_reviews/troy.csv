Smart and well-acted.In ""My Golden Days"" Paul (Quentin Dolmaire left) recalls his days with pals played by Theo Fernandez (from left) Yassine Douighi Raphael Cohen and Pierre Andrau.(Photo Magnolia Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 out of 5 starsThe easiest way to describe ""My Golden Days"" is as a coming-of-age romance but Arnaud Desplechins film with its memories and carefully nursed grudges and moments of heartbreak and betrayal feels weightier than that.The memories belong to Paul Dedalus (Mathieu Amalric) also the protagonist of Desplechins 1996 film ""My Sex Life ... or How I Got into an Argument."" The film begins with Dedalus now an anthropology professor saying goodbye to a lover as he leaves Tajikistan for a job in France. There is a problem with his passport which leads to a flood of memories which come to him in three parts.Quentin Dolmaire stars in the French-language drama ""My Golden Days."" (Photo Magnolia Pictures)""Childhood"" recalls the adolescent Paul leaving his home unable to bear his unstable mother any longer. He moves in with an aunt (Francoise Lebrun) someone he will long remember. ""Russia"" finds the teenage Paul (now played by newcomer Quentin Dolmaire) on a high-school trip to the Soviet Union where he and a friend break away from the group and smuggle money and other items to Jewish refuseniks -- and gives one his passport the source of the problem he runs into later.But it is the third memory ""Esther"" around which the film is centered. At this point Paul is a student living in Paris but he spends some time in his hometown of Roubaix with his sister and some of her friends. There he sees Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) perched on a pedestal entertaining the attention of boys something she has obviously done before (""get in line"" Pauls sister says).Mathieu Amalric in ""My Golden Days."" (Photo Magnolia Pictures)Paul is smitten to say the least. Esther is or at least seems to be supremely confident. (""I have that effect"" she says simply when he tells her she blocks out all others.) They begin an affair that is almost stereotypically French with each taking lovers on the side while he goes back to Paris to study.But the affair takes on unexpected dimensions. Roy-Lecollinet also a newcomer manages a wide range of emotions that she carries off with commitment. There is more to her than being just a beautiful flirt but not necessarily what you would expect.Desplechin floods the movie with images that seem to swirl past but anchor the film in its time the 1980s. There is Boris Yeltsin on TV or the fall of the Berlin Wall (an event that thrills everyone but Paul who sees it as a symbol of the fall of his youth). The music is key too. Desplechin sets many scenes to 80s-era hip-hop and funk and hes exceptional at picking just the right beats.Its just another device to immerse us deeper into the film (there are others including Desplechins use of the camera). By the time Amalric returns for a scorched-earth epilogue were fully in thrall. ""My Golden Days"" is a trip down memory lane and more.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Photo courtesy Why Not Productions/TNS) Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet in ""My Golden Days."" (Photo courtesy Why Not Productions/TNS) Photo Handout TNS Golden Days an intense and radiant portrayal of young love 1 / 1 Back to Gallery French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin has a gift for pairing unexpected genres to produce something new and strange. In his new movie ""My Golden Days"" we learn the stories of a youngsters troubled family life and his later complicated first love separated by an episode in which as a student abroad he carries out a secret potentially dangerous mission. But the element of spy story isnt about stimulating your pulse -- the point is the characters depth of commitment and what he values. Its a story about the happiness and despair that passionate young love can bring an ancient theme that gets vivid new life in the hands of an exceptional director. If you know Desplechins work youll recall the name Paul Dedalus a character played by the inimitable Mathieu Amalric in the filmmakers highly regarded 1996 work ""My Sex Life ... or How I Got Into an Argument."" (Amalric has appeared in a number of other Desplechin productions including ""A Christmas Tale"" 2008). The young Paul -- engagingly portrayed by newcomer Quentin Dolmaire -- is the main figure in ""My Golden Days"" but Amalric turns up in a modest role as the adult. Most of this new film consists of his memories. I wont spoil the details of Pauls childhood except to say that his mother is troubled enough to bring great grief to her husband and three children and Paul winds up making his own way. And as for his high school trip to Russia which winks an eye at conventions of espionage thrillers he winds up getting involved in efforts to aid Russian Jews (at a time when the Berlin Wall was still standing). But the movies real heart is Pauls relationship with Esther a very appealing and idiosyncratic schoolmate of his younger sister. As finely played by Lou Roy-Lecollinet she is acutely aware of her intoxicating effect on the opposite sex telling Paul with perfect accuracy ""You cant forget me and you never will."" It will be an on-and-off affair marked by numerous interludes with other lovers. Desplechin is a highly intelligent energetic sort who loves to fill his movies with both classical and pop culture references -- its a style that might put you in mind of the French New Wave. In fact he tries to accomplish so much here that the film goes off on a few tangents that perhaps dont quite fit. Still the details -- some funny some intensely painful -- of Paul and Esthers relationship over the years have a cumulative power that isnt diminished by a few loose ends. That power partly results from the performances Desplechin extracts from these two talented young actors. Its a pleasure to watch them. Paul often says that he feels nothing but he is mistaken. He does and so do we. This is a film that steadily deepens -- putting the epilogue aside the story ends on a somber note thats unexpected in light of the movies nostalgic title. Remember these are memories of youth recollected in later life. The adult Paul seems to think that something extraordinary happened in his past and this time hes right.

Photo Magnolia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW MY GOLDEN DAYS In French with English subtitles. Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (graphic nudity profanity). Director Arnaud Desplechin (""A Christmas Tale) channels Francois Truffaut for this intoxicating sequel to Desplechins 1996 comedy ""My Sex Life or How I Got Into an Argument in which the now-middle-aged anthropologist Paul (Mathieu Amalric) recalls his youthful adventures while being interrogated for being a possible Russian spy. There are brief segments devoted to Pauls childhood (his mother commits suicide after he moves in with his great-aunt) and a school visit to Minsk by a teenage Paul (Quentin Dolmaire) who smuggles money and documents to Russian Jews. Most of ""My Golden Days is devoted to Pauls heady 6-year relationship with the beautiful headstrong Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) as the two of them drift in and out of other peoples beds during the years our hero is at college. Desplechin draws uniformly superb performances from his young cast making the coming-of-age genre seem fresh and vital.

Join the ConversationTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQsReview Golden Days looks back on young lovers Tom Long The Detroit News 1130 p.m. EDT April 7 2016""My Golden Days"" is so French it should come with a croissant.Theres smoking (lots of smoking). Theres sex (lots of sex). Theres existential angst (so much existential angst). And regret a smidgen of political intrigue betrayal and longing for love lost.Theres also a sense of wandering through a life. That life would belong to Paul Dedalus (Mathieu Amalric) who we first meet as an anthropology professor being called back to Paris after decades spent living in far-flung territories. As hes returning his passport is called into question; it seems theres someone else using a passport with his same name and date of birth.This brings on the films long flashback. We see a young Paul dealing with a mentally ill mother taking refuge with a lesbian great-aunt and then marching along in his mothers funeral procession after shes committed suicide.Jump forward a few years and teenage Paul (Quentin Dolmaire) is taking a trip to Russia with a Jewish friend part of a touring group. He is asked by some shady political players to deliver a care package to oppressed Jews there. Hes also asked to turn over his passport so that a young man his age can use it to escape to Israel.So right around here it looks like this is going to be a movie about espionage. Except its French. So instead it turns into a movie about -- what else? -- love.Paul makes it back from Russia unharmed and leaves his provincial birthplace to study in Paris. But one weekend he returns home and meets the mesmerizing and self-assured Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet). Hes smitten shes coy but then she comes around. They become lovers even as Paul is living most of the time in Paris.He has a mistress she takes on other lovers - again because theyre French and there are laws that require such things. They break up get back together ache cry and take on more lovers. And thats pretty much the movie until the adult Paul returns to Paris and we find out that hes still yearning for the Esther of his youth. Ah the agony of romance.All of this is laid out in earnest seriousness by director and co-writer Arnaud Desplechin and while the ghosts of teen romances past no doubt hover over many of us after a while you might find yourself wanting to slap Paul Dedalus across the face. Dude that was 30 years ago get over it Except the French probably dont speak dude.Tom Long is a longtime culture critic.My Golden DaysGRADE CRated R for some strong sexual content graphic nudity and languageRunning time 123 minutesAt the Detroit Film TheatreCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1MXxN8z MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/04/07/movie-review-golden-days-looks-back-young-lovers/82777164/,200,troy3,troy,detroitnews

They are a decade younger than Amalric and Devos were when they starred in the first film and both are at the beginning of their own very promising careers. If their work over the next 30 years follows paths as interesting Amalrics and Devoss it will be a great boost to French films. Also Read Wanda Group Invests in 3.1 Billion French Entertainment Complex ""My Golden Days"" begins with a middle-aged Paul again played by Amalric forced into reflection through a fairly contrived narrative device an airport immigration interview related to a discrepancy with his passport. It seems that there is another Paul Dedalus exactly his age and from his home town roaming around the world with his passport. Paul knows why there is a second Dedalus but this is a tale that will take a bit of framing (French dramas always do) so we settle in with Paul and his interrogators for a story during which we experience a series of flashbacks to a period before the events of ""My Sex Life."" While all these cinematic machinations are clever they are not the point of this movie. ""My Golden Days"" is about regret and yearning for a time and a self that have past never to return. Its about trying to reconcile the decisions of yesteryear with the holes in our lives today. Paul has his own holes some left by his mother; broadly referenced in ""My Sex Life"" those issues are revealed in detail here. And theres the hole left by Esther who broke up with him 20 years ago in that other movie. But now we understand that breakup better at least from Pauls point of view by watching this movie. Also Read Jacques Rivette French New Wave Director Dies at 87 ""My Golden Days"" is lovely and thoughtful yet it has elements of a thriller too. Before meeting Esther young Paul takes a school trip to Soviet Russia in the early 1980s when Russian Jewish Refuseniks were at issue. The young Paul is asked to take on a daring task that involves helping a young Jewish man get out of the Soviet Union. This sequence has all the tension of a John le Carre adaptation and it explains that other Paul Dedalus hopping the globe. (Framing is everything in French films.) We also spend a bit of time with the very young Paul (Antoine Bui) his sister Delphine (Ivy Dodds) and his younger brother Ivan (Timon Michel). Paul must protect his siblings from their insane mother and often has to threaten her with a knife to keep her from hurting them. Overwhelmed he goes to live with his elderly lesbian aunt and her lover where he begins to understand the greater world. But for the most part we are with the adolescent Paul after he meets Esther beginning the decade-long relationship we already know will end with regrets that the older Paul expresses during his interrogation.

In interviews Desplechin has said that he did not ask his young actors both making their film debuts to see the original film and as far as he knows they never have. In any case ""My Golden Days"" is classic post-French New Wave filmmaking from one of the best of the era alongside Benoit Jacquot and Catherine Breillat among others. One of the directors crowning touches is his mix of a dramatic score from Gregoire Hetzel and Mike Kourtzer (along with a touch of Stravinsky) with contemporary pop music from the era including everything from Ska and De La Soul to the Specials. Those musical choices blended with the ever-so-slightly overly dramatic performances from its wonderful young actors makes ""My Golden Days"" incredibly French.

Magnolia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Adolescent love in all its ardor is the ostensible subject of Arnaud Desplechins ""My Golden Days"" but its real subject is moviemaking itself. The film is an arty grab bag of lifts and homages drawn from French films most pointedly director Francois Truffauts. Its the kind of movie that probably appeals best to film critics who can congratulate each other for spotting all the ""in"" references. Divided into three sections its mostly about Paul Dedalus (played as a young man by Quentin Dolmaire) whose devotion to the captivatingly flirty Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) is the on again off again core of his existence. There are some perceptive passages dealing with the infuriating inconstancy of young love and a few pointed scenes featuring the adult Paul (played by Mathieu Amalric) but overall this overlong movie is too knowingly coy for its own good.

Slideshow My Golden Days Desplechins prequel to My Sex Life ... gets young love right Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Mathieu Amalric the busy French actor and filmmaker is back as Paul now a successful anthropologist reflecting (via an amusing interrogation framing device) on pivotal episodes from his life. The original title of Desplechins new film translates to Three Memories of My Youth and thats what we get wonderfully evocative funny sad complex and essential passages from a mans childhood and adolescence. Cut to the kid actor (Antoine Bui) playing Paul in the opening section where he grapples (literally) with his mentally unstable mother. He runs away to live with his great-aunt (Francoise Lebrun) who hands him a sketchbook and a box of pencils and encourages him to draw. The ""Childhood"" chapter gives way to ""Russia"" in which a teenage Paul (the terrific Quentin Dolmaire - the real star of the movie) is off on an adventure in the old Soviet Union peeling away from his tour-guided classmates to fall into some amateur spy business with his best friend. But the longest richest chapter in My Golden Days is ""Esther"" a stirring account of first love as Paul meets Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) a radiant wide-eyed cigarette-smoking schoolgirl. Hes dazzled by her aloofness and her confidence and in their first conversation confesses that hes useless at pickup lines. It is his candor that first charms Esther who ultimately brushes off her beaux (yes plural) to be with Paul. We see the pair as high schoolers and then later - as Paul goes to Paris and she stays in their hometown Roubaix - as young adults. They write letters. They visit. They argue. They make love. Dolmaire and Roy-Lecollinet both new to acting convey the roiling all-consuming nature of the relationship and the way each changes and grows their identities shaped in fundamental ways by the other. My Golden Days feels connected to Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel stories but also to a wide sample of films and filmmakers (the 80s clothes the American cars and the beating Paul takes from a gang on the street all echo early Scorsese playfully). The storytelling is simple the emotions intense the way Desplechin dives into a life - into these lives - is a marvel. sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 My Golden DaysDirected by Arnaud Desplechin.

Comments My Golden Days Recommended Rated R  123 minutes  2015 The lazy-minded will call this a coming-of-age drama but its the exact opposite the hero (Mathieu Amalric) a French anthropologist living in Tajikistan looks back on his teenage years with angst and disappointment as if hes never really gotten past them. Writer-director Arnaud Desplechin reviving the Paul Dedalus character from his 1996 success My Sex Life . . . or How I Got Into an Argument lets the late-80s flashbacks take over the narrative and they trace a complex romantic journey between the teenage Paul (Quentin Dolmaire) and a classmate (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) whom he manages to take away from a stronger guy (getting his ass kicked in the process) but then alienates as pain over his mothers death a few years earlier overpowers him. An adventurous and psychologically acute storyteller (A Christmas Tale Jimmy P) Desplechin presents the high schoolers relationships with an adult complexity from which the grown-up Paul seems to stand back in awe.

(Magnolia Pictures) ""My Golden Days"" is a movie about looking back in more ways than one. The film consists of the nostalgic reveries of a middle-age man whos about to trade his globe-trotting existence for a quieter life back home in France. But its also director Arnaud Desplechins second shot at the story of Paul Dedalus played here as he was 20 years ago in ""My Sex Life . . . or How I Got Into an Argument"" by Mathieu Amalric. The movie begins as Paul is traveling from Tajikistan to Paris. Questioned by customs officials who think he may be a spy Paul explains himself while flashing back to his boyhood. The movie is broken into three parts (the French title translates to ""Three Memories of My Youth"") childhood Russia and Esther. And in the movie as in the mind of our protagonist Esther takes up the most space. Paul (played during flashbacks by Quentin Dolmaire) was a moptopped 19-year-old college kid when he met her. Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) was a few years younger although hardly intimidated by an older guy. ""I always have that effect"" she tells Paul breezily when he says he cant keep his eyes off her. What follows is a coming-of-age love story exploding with emotion. The themes in the script co-written by Desplechin with Julie Peyr are nothing new but ""My Golden Days"" feels vivid and fresh. The movie bears more than a passing resemblance to Francois Truffauts films about Antoine Doinel. Like Truffaut Desplechin doesnt shy away from the serious stuff -- the suicide of Pauls mother his fathers deep depression -- but lighthearted even farcical moments are never far off such as when friendship blooms between Esther and the other married woman Paul has been sleeping with. Even dangerous stories seem less threatening in hindsight. When Paul recalls scurrying around the old Soviet Union helping Jewish radicals the scene feels less like a mission than a romp. The movie masterfully crystallizes the unruly episodic nature of memories re-creating the way certain small things stay with us while other much larger events recede into a haze of cigarette smoke. There are also surreal moments as when a teenage Paul has a conversation with his beloved dead aunt or when as an older man he sees himself as a little boy sitting before him. Desplechin puts as much emphasis on form as function. The characters directly address the camera on occasion and some scenes look as if they were shot through a peephole. No matter how eccentric all the flourishes feel purposeful. Even as it delves into the messy patchwork of recollections ""My Golden Days"" always looks like a movie that was lovingly pieced together.

Photo Magnolia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com March 17 2016 356 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS After seeing ""My Golden Days"" an enchanting memory piece by Arnaud Desplechin I cant stop remembering scene after vivid scene. (The language is French with English subtitles.) And I cant shake the feeling not that I want to that this isnt only a wise and graceful film but in its tossed-off way a great one with a debut performance--by a young actress named Lou Roy-Lecollinet--that will prove to be unforgettable. The hero Paul Dedalus is played by Mathieu Amalric who first played him two decades ago in Mr. Desplechins ""My Sex Life...or How I Got Into an Argument."" Now Paul a professor of anthropology is looking back on his life as he prepares to leave Tajikistan for a foreign ministry post in his native France. His recollections are organized as much as swirls of memory can be into three sections--a turbulent childhood blighted by his mothers madness; a high-school field trip to the Soviet Union where Paul a good Christian gave his passport to a young Jewish refusenik (who successfully escaped became his globe-roaming twin); and his university days when Ms. Roy-Lecollinets Esther became the bewitching and bedeviling love of his life. More Reviews Midnight Special Krisha Paul first spots Esther perched on a circular planter in a schoolyard . Then we see her through his eyes in one small panel of a screen split into three. (Irina Lubtchansky did the lovely cinematography.) But her panel swiftly expands to take over the screen and Esther takes over the film. The hero in adolescence is played by Quentin Dolmaire; its another exceptional debut performance. Bright and verbal Paul cant help being charming with Esther; its how he evades himself and avoids dangerous feelings that keep threatening to boil up from childhood. But she cant help being by breathtaking turns triumphantly self-satisfied alarmingly fragile or effortlessly droll as well as willful and cruel at certain moments and kind and nurturing at others. I cant imagine how Mr. Desplechin elicited such a performance from someone with no professional experience but Esther evokes in dazzling flashes Jeanne Moreaus peerlessly mercurial Catherine in Francois Truffauts New Wave classic ""Jules and Jim."" Will ""My Golden Days"" which the director wrote with Julie Peyr also come to be considered a classic? Id like to think so and not only because of the films winning grace and buoyancy. I havent talked until now about Mr. Amalric but this singular star is seen at his best in an epilogue of astonishing ferocity when Paul finally opens himself with a vengeance to the hurts and betrayals the grief and rage that he has managed to avoid for most of his life. Its a riveting spectacle and a thrilling one. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download A Christmas Tale (2008) Arnaud Desplechins long improbably funny and affecting film is a tale told as Christmas approaches of a family riven by dissension and as once before by deadly illness. Junon the mother played imperiously by Catherine Deneuve has leukemia the disease that took her firstborn son. If she can be saved its only by a marrow transplant from a blood relative so a black-comedy competition gets under way as those who love her get tested for compatibility. 1 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

By Anthony Lane Michael Shannon stars in a new film from the director Jeff Nichols.   Credit Illustration by Rune Fisker The films of Jeff Nichols who was born in Little Rock in 1978 are both easy on the eye and hard to watch. The visual command in the framing and the pacing of his tales rarely slackens or stalls yet the air of miasmic dread that rises from them is enough to make you duck out of the cinema to breathe. He has made four features ""Shotgun Stories"" (2007) ""Take Shelter"" (2011) ""Mud"" (2012) and ""Midnight Special"" his latest and his largest movie to date. The actor Michael Shannon appears in all four films starring in three of them and if you seek a reliable guide to Nicholss work consider Shannons face. Smiles do not become it; the mouth tightens by reflex to a crinkled line and once in ""Take Shelter"" it gapes wide in a terrible and soundless O as the hero wakes from a nightmare. The eyes not quite matched are set far apart in a square and noble head which feels too heavy with care to be borne upon his shoulders. Although he is rangy and tall anxiety freights him down or brings him to a devastated halt. Shannon does not look alien exactly but never even in company do his characters seem like happy members of the human tribe. In ""Midnight Special"" he plays Roy who is sought in connection with the kidnapping of a child. A news report identifies the kid as Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) age eight and Roy as the suspect. We see the two of them plus another guy named Lucas (Joel Edgerton) holed up in a motel room. The hour is dusky and tense and we are bracing ourselves for unpleasantness or for something worse when Roy picks up the boy--who instead of struggling puts his arms gently around Roys neck. That submission is ambiguous (could Alton be under his spell?) and the uncertainty grows as we switch to another location where a salty-haired fellow (Sam Shepard) gives orders to two subordinates. ""You have four days to get the boy back"" he says. He is neatly dressed in a jacket and tie but none of them are in uniform. If theyre not cops however what are they? And to whom does this child wanted and hunted belong? These early scenes show Nichols at his best--and his best is as good and as keenly distinctive as anything now being done by an American director. He keeps us guessing entrusts us with the task of figuring out what on earth is going on and proves that the mysteries of that earth however confounding are the enemy of the vague. A dream can be delivered in a brisk and businesslike fashion. Just because something is unexplained need not deny it the hard-edged clarity of a fact. Hence the russet rain that pools in a mans palm in ""Take Shelter"" or the crack of thunder that he alone can hear; hence the boat near the start of ""Mud"" perched calmly in the branches of a tree. Likewise as Alton and his captors or companions take to the road (and ""Midnight Special"" is among other things a thoroughgoing road movie) Lucas at the wheel dons night-vision goggles kills the headlamps and powers on into the dark. Such gestures are unquestioned; they are driven by the engine of necessity--the unreasoning force by which the denizens of Nicholss films are charged up and often against their better judgment compelled to act. In ""Shotgun Stories"" the compulsion was family vengeance with brothers named Son Kid and Boy. In ""Take Shelter"" Nicholss first brush with the supernatural there was a terror of apocalypse. In the new film which he both wrote and directed compulsion stirs within Alton himself. Roy it turns out is the boys father not his abductor in other words but his protector. Alton was taken from his parents and housed at the heart of a religious cult (Shepard plays its leader) which hung on the childs every word. Now that Roy has retrieved him they are headed for the home of his mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst). One recurring theme in Altons speeches is a date toward which he--and according to the cult world history--is somehow tending. What is due then and where it will occur only he knows and his parents mission is to get him there. But are they his parents? Might he be a messiah? Stigmata of light emerge on his hands and sometimes a fierce blue ray erupts from his eyes which have to be covered with goggles. The glow of day is dangerous for Alton and he needs to be moved around by night. Yet heres the thing hes a nice kid polite and undemanding played in a tranquil key by Lieberher and content to sit in the back of the car and read comic books. (""Whats Kryptonite?"" he asks.) He tells his father not to worry about him. ""I like worrying about you"" Roy replies. When in an astonishing sequence great balls of fire descend on a lonely gas station Alton says sorry the fire is his doing. Its not a meteor shower but a satellite which has been tracking him and has to be brought down. By now everyone is on his trail the cult the F.B.I. the military and the N.S.A. in the person of Sevier (Adam Driver). This being a Nichols movie (as opposed to a Marvel production say) the pursuers are not outright villains or credulous dolts but plausible souls in extremis and I liked the uncritical tone with which Sevier interviewing cult members asks what they saw in the blaze that emanates from Alton. ""I wouldnt know where to start"" one man says. Nichols is a laureate of the heartland staying away from cities sticking to back roads and lighting upon unregarded folk with little money to spare. His previous movies were set in Ohio and his home state of Arkansas and the new film travels from Texas to Louisiana and from blacked-out rooms to shining reed beds by the sea. Comparisons have been made with Spielberg and there are sprinkles of ""The Sugarland Express"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" yet he and Nichols could not be more distinct in their emotional signatures. Contrast the two Roys both of them obsessed one played by Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" his face lifted eagerly toward the miraculous and the other in ""Midnight Special"" his features fraught with the fear that though the world might be saved he could yet lose his son. Should we be surprised then that the climax is a letdown? Nichols prefers the quick and the oblique (only once is a firearm discharged in ""Shotgun Stories"" and its pointed at a tire) and finales of any grandeur dont suit his skills. ""Mud"" was marred by a shoot-out and ""Midnight Special"" lingers way too long on its concluding spectacle--both a vast computer-generated solution to the puzzle of Altons nature and a strange diminution of the impact he has had on peoples lives. (With the light show that ended ""Close Encounters"" by contrast everything fell into place.) Yet Nicholss movie though smudged by its denouement is not wrecked and already I am desperate--with a Roy-like yearning--to return to it and to revel anew in its group portrait of those who are haunted by the will to believe. As one man says having stared into the ice-blue inferno of Altons gaze ""I had to see again."" Amen to that. The hero of ""My Golden Days"" bears the Joycean name of Paul Dedalus. We have met him before. He was a philanderer-philosopher played by Mathieu Amalric in ""My Sex Life . . . or How I Got Into an Argument"" in 1996. Twenty years on the films director Arnaud Desplechin circles back to the character as if nagged by a sense of something half explored and digs down into his past. Amalric shows up again briefly as the restless middle-aged Paul now an anthropologist who returns to France after years abroad. A problem with his passport on arrival triggers a long flashback to his teen-age self. (The role is taken by Quentin Dolmaire making his screen debut and displaying a nicely amused intensity.) On a school trip Paul crosses the Iron Curtain and goes to Minsk having agreed at some personal risk to smuggle money and papers to Jewish dissidents. Hes neither Jewish nor given to ideological fervor; he just warms to the adventure. We then jump to his college days during which he dwells in an attic apartment and as expected punctuates his bookishness with love and sex. This is a portrait of the sack artist as a young man. The movie runs along a well-worn groove both in its fealty to adolescent sorrows and in its stout conviction that cigarettes constitute a major food group. As in all Desplechin films however surprises are continually sprung; the screen will suddenly split or dwindle to an iris shot. Shaggy-dog stories hound the plot. Major events even deaths get tossed away while tiny sideshows--like a fracas between Pauls girlfriend Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) and the mother of a pal--are revealed in full. Oddly the effect of that imbalance is not just to heighten the charm of the film but to render it more credible the course of true memory never did run smooth. When Paul is beaten up by Esthers ex for instance the pain quickly fades. ""I felt nothing"" he says. Yet the thought of her goes on throbbing like a wound.

You dont have to see My Sex Life first since My Golden Days stands on its own as an origin story. More News 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 The Witch Inside the Horror Movie of the Year Don Cheadle Why I Had to Make My Miles Davis Movie All Stories >> Related 15 Great Movies You May Have Missed in 2015 From a French EDM film to a single-shot heist thriller -- the years cant-miss movies you need to see Now in his 50s Desplechin has made something vibrantly alive and fueled by teen hormones that are ready to howl. The great actor Mathieu Amalric once again plays Paul Dedalus an anthropologist returning to Paris after years in Tadjikstan. Held by security at the airport on charges of possible espionage he recounts his story to a government interrogator (Andre Dussolier). Thats the movie told mostly in flashback. We meet the young Paul now played with irresistibly awkward charm by the terrific newcomer Quentin Dolmaire. Desplechin guides us through Pauls unsettled childhood with a suicidal mother and then switches to spy thriller mode as Paul travels to Russia and smuggles cash and passports to Russian Jews (hence the interrogation). But the main focus is on Pauls all-consuming love affair with a heartbreaker named Esther  played with a tough core of intelligence and wit by Lou Roy-Lecollinet. Its here that Desplechin and these two captivating actors capture the euphoria of first love and the sting that comes when adult trouble intrudes on  paradise. In Desplechins best films including Kings amp; Queen and A Christmas Tale the comic and the tragic regularly bump heads. My Golden Days brings out a playful side in Desplechin and also an aching tenderness. Memory gives the movie a formal frame but Desplechin laces the past with such raw emotion that nothing is hemmed in. Love hurts thats for sure. And Desplechin makes sure we feel it. He crafts My Golden Days as if hed never made a movie before as if youthful emotions were spilling all over it. The result is an exhilarating gift.

"Review In My Golden Days the pangs of first love are felt again - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES In My Golden Days the pangs of first love are felt again In My Golden Days the pangs of first love are felt again Magnolia Pictures A youthful romance burns between characters played by Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet. A youthful romance burns between characters played by Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet. (Magnolia Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Arnaud Desplechins Cannes sensation ""My Golden Days"" contains an intoxicatingly realistic portrayal of the intense emotionality the intertwined joy and pain of first love. Its not the whole film but its power is so strong it feels like it is.The translation of the pictures original French title ""Three Memories of My Youth"" gives a more accurate idea of what Desplechin is up to here. This is essentially an omnibus film featuring a trio of stories all dealing with the early days of Paul Dedalus the alter ego of co-writer (with Julie Peyr) and director Desplechin. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link As played by Mathieu Amalric the die-hard romantic Dedalus was the protagonist of one of Desplechins earlier films ""My Sex Life or ... How I Got Into an Argument."" But enjoyment of this new tale created with tangible warmth and emotional precision is not linked to familiarity with that earlier effort.Amalric does make a brief but crucial appearance as the adult Dedalus in the framing device that opens and closes the film. We meet him as an anthropologist working in Tajikistan but returning to Paris to take on a government job a return that triggers the three memories of the title. The first memory titled ""Childhood"" has the very young Paul growing up in Roubaix (Desplechins home town as well) and dealing with a difficult family of origin trying to comfort and protect his two siblings from both a deranged mother and a depressive father.Next comes ""Russia"" the story of a high school trip to Minsk (now in Belarus) where he agrees to give his passport to a young Russian Jew desperate to leave the country and start a new life.Both of these stories (which take up 30 minutes of the films two-hour running time) present a Dedalus who feels things very deeply. Its a trait that makes life difficult for him more often than not but he wouldnt have it any other way. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The lions share of ""Golden Days"" running time is devoted to the third story ""Esther"" named after the young woman who turns out to be not only Dedalus first love but also the most significant passion of his life. It starts with a 19-year-old Dedalus (newcomer Quentin Dolmaire) an impoverished student working toward a bachelors degree in anthropology in Paris returning to Roubaix to visit his younger brother and sister.There he locks eyes with the 16-year-old Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet another newcomer) whose come-hither blond sensuality makes her the femme fatale of the local high school.""My eyes devour you"" he tells her and she confidently replies ""I always do that to guys. I have that effect because Im exceptional. You cant forget me you never will.""The ups and downs of what goes on between these two plays out amid the chaos of his siblings and their circle of friends (a portrait of the hectic nature of the young adult years that feels exactly right) but Esther and Dedalus are always front and center.We see them playing out the drama of attraction and insecurity inexorably drawn to each other but having to face the problems different personalities invariably bring to relationships.Their passion makes them mad with both desire and despair and their intimate love scenes are convincingly filmed by cinematographer Irina Lubtchansky. Yet their union is as spiritual as it is physical as each is able to see the other person whole in a way the rest of their circle cannot.The difficulties they face however are formidable starting with the one of distance as both are forced by their school lives to spend most of their time in different cities. This leads to a soulful exchange of letters some of which are read to the camera by the actors to great effect.These young actors guided by the veteran Desplechin are so effective in their roles that we feel we are watching them live out a lifetimes worth of emotions right in front of our eyes. Film has always been especially effective it portraying what it can feel like what it can mean to be in love and ""My Golden Days"" is right up there with the best of them.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------My Golden DaysIn French with English subtitlesMPAA rating R for some strong sexual content graphic nudity and languageRunning time 2 hoursPlaying Landmark West Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-my-golden-days-review-20160318-column.html,200,troy14,troy,latimes

Courtesy of Magnolia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Magnolia Pictures Lou Roy-Lecollinet and Quentin Dolmaire in My Golden Days. Courtesy of Magnolia Pictures Paul Dedalus can be a man of action. The middle-class protagonist of the dynamic yet ultimately melancholy My Golden Days carries a gun into a tense negotiation with a drug dealer and happily accepts a secret mission to carry documents and cash to Jewish refuseniks while on a high-school trip behind what was then the Iron Curtain. Yet Paul -- like his Irish cousin James Joyces Stephen Dedalus -- is more observer than doer. In fact hes an anthropology student who will grow up to be the central character in director Arnaud Desplechins 1996 film My Sex Life or ... How I Got Into an Argument. The older Paul is played by Desplechin regular Matthieu Amalric who also had the role 20 years ago. He appears only in brief framing stories set in Tajikstan and Paris. The movie belongs to Quentin Dolmaire soulful and selfish as the teenage Paul and Lou Roy-Lecollinet who movingly plays Esther the troubled girlfriend he cant comfort and will never forget. Despite its references to ancient Greek literature My Golden Days doesnt try for classical symmetry. Its French title means ""three memories of my youth"" and the film does consist primarily of a trio of episodes set in the 1970s and 80s. But the first two are quick and open-ended while the third is a movie in itself. In the elliptical first chapter Paul protects his two younger siblings from their manic mother and then seeks refuge with his lesbian great-aunt. He hears a story about a Stalinist execution and attends a funeral. The circumstances wont be explained until later. The second part sends Paul and a Jewish pal to Minsk where they meet the refuseniks. Paul makes a spontaneous gift that will inconvenience him later and also provide a metaphor for his detachment. ""I feel nothing"" is Pauls refrain although its not always true. Finally Paul meets Esther one of his younger sisters classmates. Shes a headstrong siren whos certain of her attractiveness yet has doubts about her other qualities. Their relationship is roiled by infidelities on both sides and also by distance. Paul is studying in Paris while Esther still lives in Roubaix Pauls -- and the directors -- Belgian-border hometown. Like My Sex Life Desplechins latest effort is as much novelistic as cinematic. Indeed it might benefit from being longer and more discursive so as to fill in such sketchy characters as Pauls enigmatic younger brother and to show more of how Esther became the person she is in the earlier film. The overall style is realistic and Irina Lubtchanskys hand-held cinematography emulates documentary. Yet the director includes such movie-buff touches as split screens (most popular in the 70s) and iris shots (which recall silent movies). Although the performances are immediate the goal is to evoke a sense of the past. This lost age is not particularly golden. Wispy classical-style music is interrupted by the earthy rap and funk of George Clinton Run D.M.C. and Roxanne Shante and Pauls historical and anthropological interest in the former Soviet Union is tempered by his experience of Communist oppression. But then this is a movie where Paul greets the demolition of the Berlin Wall with regret; he sees not freedom for millions but the end of his childhood. Years later in a startling scene with the middle-aged Paul a hometown rival and the latters wife Esther also becomes a symbol of private loss. Its impossible to say how autobiographical My Golden Days is but theres no question that its profoundly personal.

It is the former center of a textile industry the finish line of the storied Paris-Roubaix bicycle classic and the hometown of the gifted French writer-director Arnaud Desplechin. Desplechins latest My Golden Days represents a three-point return to Roubaix previously the setting of his family ensemble piece A Christmas Tale; to the rap and college rock 1980s of his youth; and to the archetypal characters of whats still one of his best films My Sex Life... Or How I Got Into An Argument the freeform three-hour hip relationship drama to end all hip relationship dramas. Desplechin tackles drama with wildly confident eclecticism sometimes even besting Martin Scorsese in pure movie-mad feverishness iris shots radically different camera styles unexpected musical and literary quotations theatrical flourishes scenes broken up in collage. His take on the coming-of-age film however is one of those cases where the framing devices and framing stories are more compelling than whats being framed. In a typically offbeat move Desplechin begins My Golden Days--a movie thats mostly about horny teenagers in 80s Roubaix--in Tajikistan with a slowed-down arrangement of the theme from Shoot The Piano Player playing under dialogue in Russian. Paul Dedalus (Mathieu Amalric Desplechins charmingly fidgety regular leading man) is an ethnologist returning to France after nearly a decade abroad; he isnt exactly the same Paul Dedalus that Amalric played in My Sex Life.. though he has the same pensive and neurotic qualities. Stopped at the airport Paul is taken into a grayish room to be interrogated by a nameless agent (Andre Dussollier) who tells him that theres a man with his exact name birthplace and birth date living in Australia. This question folds out into an unconventional Cold War thriller and the story of how the teenage Paul (Quentin Dolmaire) helped Soviet Jews during a school trip to Minsk but not before an extended foray deeper into his childhood and his bad memories of his mentally ill mother and his fond memories of his great aunt. Then after a few more detours My Golden Days settles into its third and central chapter titled ""Esther"" after Pauls insecure first love. Again this isnt exactly the same Esther who was Pauls girlfriend in My Sex Life... though shes played by Lou Roy-Lecollinet who bears a strong resemblance to Emmanuelle Devos who played the character in the earlier film. Toning down his dizzying style just a notch Desplechin evokes small-town teenage life in the pre-cell phone age set to a soundtrack packed with everything from jangly twee to classic hip-hop to first-wave ska. But though Dolmaire and Roy-Lecollinet both first-timers are good in their roles their characters lack the neuroticism and anxiety needed to match Desplechins manic omnivorous style. The directors longstanding preoccupations are all here ethnography the Cold War therapy (parodied in Pauls interrogation) classical literature. But in lieu of his usually unpredictable narratives there is a more or less traditional coming-of-age piece laced with pity and nostalgia in which undergrad Paul studying in his first year in Paris falls in love with the high-school-age Esther over weekend visits home. Desplechin loves his Shakespeare and his best films like My Sex Life... and Kings amp; Queen seem to be aiming for the Bards range following countless interesting characters from farce to naturalism with a creative vocabulary that tries to create an audiovisual equivalent to Shakespeares inventive and imaginative language. But despite some striking uses of direct-to-camera address (a Desplechin staple) My Golden Days undercurrents of regret remain just that never breaking in a gush over the colorful surface of the film. Still its a treat to watch covered in eccentric strokes and oddball details that seem too specific not to be extremely personal. What comes effortlessly to the film--sensuality the specifics of place and era droll humor the atmosphere of teenage social life--leaves more of an impression than the elegy for things past it tries to squeeze out of Pauls point-of-view.

Later protagonist Paul Dedalus (Mathieu Amalric) declaims on what he considers ""the one pleasure"" that will never go away in life ""the surprise when I stick my hand in the panties of a girl I dont know."" For a bravura 90-second take (background music Stevie Wonders ""Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away"") Desplechin locks in on Paul with a long lens as Amalric slides side to side back and forth dodging people in a shoulder-to-shoulder room so he can deliver his furious sermon without interruption.In his new My Golden Days Desplechin finds this same Paul Dedalus (still Amalric) 20 years later but in characteristic form quipping ""I love organized women"" to his latest lover as she helps him prep for his return trip to France. But the bulk of the movie takes place in flashback imagining the earlier years of the teenage Paul (played by Quentin Dolmaire) and the first stages of his life-altering round-and-round love affair with Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet). Desplechins perspective on this younger Paul is more tender less critical than it was in My Sex Life Here the camera moves not with amped-up restlessness but with slow concentrated pans and the overall smoothness of a still pond.Film DetailsCritics Pick My Golden Days (Trois souvenirs de ma jeunesse) RatingR GenreDrama Running Time120 min. More Info EXPAND My Golden Days still abounds in Desplechin hallmarks An episode of Cold War-era political rebellion leads to the elder Pauls being accosted and interrogated by a mysterious official in a depressing room as Emmanuel Salinger is in The Sentinel; an episode of sudden paranoia has the teenage Paul belting himself in the face as Summer Phoenix does in Esther Kahn; and as in My Sex Life friends swap lovers with a nonchalance that inevitably leads to jilted feelings grim arguments and periods of great sorrow. Paul has a habit of declaring ""I feel nothing"" when met with physical and emotional hardship -- which might seem charming once when he says it after getting into a fight on Esthers behalf but gradually takes on disturbing edges.Despite these unsettling moments -- which include a scary memory of parental violence set in a stairway in the middle of the night -- the general impression of My Golden Days is of infectious warmth. The bracing recollections of youthful political action; the fond memories of idle afternoons spent on carpets reading and listening to records; and the sweet evocations of first love as it grows from chit-chat on the grounds outside school to long strolls the morning after a house party Desplechin views all of this with a touching complex nostalgia. There is serious pain in this movie -- pain that endures throughout the years -- but also a sincere love for life lived and life remembered.My Golden Days Directed by Arnaud Desplechin Magnolia Pictures Opens March 18 Film Society of Lincoln Center Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Danny King Follow thekingbulletin Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

""Life is strange"" Paul Dedalus declares more than once in Arnaud Desplechins ""My Golden Days"" -- and its also rich and intensely personal as we experience firsthand in this marvelously vivid origin story for the hopelessly romantic French academic played by Mathieu Amalric in 1996s three-hour Gallic gabfest ""My Sex Life or ... How I Got Into an Argument."" Amalric mostly hovers around the periphery of this feature-length flashback taking a backseat to young leads Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet (both making a superb screen debut) in a roving restless tale of unhappy childhood amateur espionage and agonizing first love. If the result offers less of the manic volubility of ""My Sex Life"" or the dazzling cinematic experimentation of the directors more recent work its nonetheless ushered along by some of the most fluid emotionally resonant filmmaking of Desplechins career and should be warmly embraced by his followers in local and international arthouse play.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Much has already been noted of the fact that Desplechin -- one of Frances most prodigious filmmaking talents and a five-time Cannes competition veteran (most recently with 2013s idiosyncratic English-language drama ""Jimmy P."") -- was passed over for a sixth shot at the Palme dOr with ""My Golden Days"" which is instead screening in the parallel Directors Fortnight program (a week ahead of its May 20 French release). As is often the case with programming politics the films ostensible rejection turns out to have very little to do with its quality though its possible festival organizers were less enamored of the storys coming-of-age trappings and beguilingly modest touch at least compared with the more aggressive visual/musical syntax and emotional extremity of works like ""Kings and Queen"" and ""A Christmas Tale."" Still in its intellectual curiosity and narrative sprawl the result is a Desplechin movie through and through and it all but pulses with life over the course of two fast-moving hours. During that time the film (scripted by Desplechin and Julie Peyr) freely drops allusions to 18th-century French painting and Greek mythology (not limited to the protagonists surname) mixes classical pieces with George Clinton on the soundtrack and juggles split-screen frames and iris shots -- the latter a subtle yet oft-used device that aptly conveys the sense of someone peering into and carefully reframing the past. After years spent working in Tajikstan professor-anthropologist Paul Dedalus (Amalric) is preparing to return to Paris triggering a series of chapter-like memories not all of which turn out to be quite as golden as the films English title would suggest. It wouldnt be a Desplechin movie without its fair share of dangerously fractious family dynamics and the very first flashback treats us to the frightening specter of our heros neurotic overbearing mother Jeanne (Cecile Garcia Fogel) whom we see 11-year-old Paul threatening to stab with a knife if she doesnt leave him alone. Not long after Paul impulsively moves in with his loving great-aunt (Francoise Lebrun) his mother kills herself sending his father (Olivier Rabourdin) into a permanent depression and leaving him ill equipped to take care of Paul or his younger siblings Delphine and Ivan. While audiences may well recall Pauls mother as being a holy terror from a brief childhood flashback in ""My Sex Life"" theres so little direct narrative overlap between the two films that ""My Golden Days"" could easily represent a standalone work and indeed requires little familiarity with its predecessor to be enjoyed. Given the playfulness of Desplechins sensibility and the many different characters Amalric has played for the director over the course of their career-long collaboration (going all the way back to 1992s ""La Sentinelle"") its hard not to wonder if the life were seeing here might belong to another Paul Dedalus entirely. In perhaps winking acknowledgment of this charming possibility the film next finds Amalrics Paul returning to France and being questioned by the authorities who have reason to suspect him of being a Russian spy. This curious misunderstanding is explained by a flashback to Pauls high-school years during which he (now played by Dolmaire) and his friend Marc (Elyot Milshtein) willingly smuggled money and documents (including Pauls passport) to Russian Jews during a high-school trip to Minsk. Desplechin has some fun making use of spy-thriller devices in the way he frames this suspenseful and mischievous episode (complete with a deadpan Andre Dussollier peering out of the shadows as Pauls present-day interrogator) but what mainly comes through is Pauls openness loyalty and honest desire to look after and help others in need. These are qualities that will serve him well during his teenage years and beyond which are recounted in the films third longest and most free-flowing chapter which Paul mostly spends bouncing between his family house in Roubaix and his studies in Paris. At home he maintains close ties with Delphine (Lily Taeib) and Ivan (Raphael Cohen) and forms a gradual yet increasingly intense attachment to Delphines beautiful schoolmate Esther (Roy-Lecollinet). In Paris he pursues a bachelors degree in anthropology staying at hostels and subsisting on the hospitality of others; meanwhile the Berlin Wall comes down the U.S.S.R. dissolves and Boris Yeltsin is elected as seen in contextualizing snippets of news footage that mark the possible end of Pauls childhood -- though it could certainly be argued that this is a kid who for better and for worse had to grow up far too soon. Rightly described at one point as having an ""angel face"" Dolmaires Paul is a soulful charmer a smooth operator who also happens to be entirely sincere (or at least damn good at convincing you of his sincerity). Its this gift -- a silver tongue and a heart of gold -- that enables him to ingratiate himself with an in-demand professor (Eve Doe-Bruce) who becomes more of a mentor figure than either of his parents; to gently talk his brother Ivan (who prays piously to God when hes not planning to rob banks) out of a sticky situation involving some local roughs; and to fall into a torrid affair with Gilberte (Melodie Richard) the girlfriend of the young man who occasionally tutors him and offers him a couch to sleep on. These various episodes cohere beautifully despite the pictures shaggy digressive narrative structure woven together by the spry rhythms of Laurence Briauds editing and a gently melancholy score composed by Gregoire Hetzel. As ever the sheer richness and variety of Desplechins human circus is such that even a stray episode involving Pauls younger cousin Bob (Theo Fernandez) and his stormy confrontation with his own overbearing mother (Anne Benoit) feels utterly of a piece with everything else. But what ultimately unifies the proceedings dramatically and emotionally is Pauls six-year stop-and-go relationship with Esther wonderfully played by charismatic newcomer Roy-Lecollinet (leading with her pout but slowly revealing much more) as a young woman whose awareness of her effect on the men in her midst has made her sullen independent-minded and boldly indifferent to the thoughts and feelings of others. Yet Esther also proves needy and fragile especially when Pauls studies and anthropology work take him far from home and she repeatedly leans on both Bob and another friend Jean-Pierre (Pierre Andrau) for romantic attention. On one level the open nature of Paul and Esthers relationship -- during which he racks up seven other lovers to her 15 -- may seem a quintessentially French social convention and the looseness of their commitment is as crucial to their sustained connection as the tenderness of their lovemaking (lensed with frank sensuality by d.p. Irina Lubtchansky). Yet Desplechin perfectly times the moment when drollery ends and anguish begins and its that sense of vulnerability that lends the film an unexpected emotional force as it moves toward its return-home epilogue. While Amalric isnt the star here he gets to set off a few dramatic fireworks as Paul gradually realizes the extent to which his first and still most important relationship affected him transforming what could have been an aimless nostalgia trip into a piercing elegiac rumination on how the past even as it slips through our fingers never quite abandons the present.

Love affairs are pretty much all-consuming when youre an adolescent and if French cinema is any indication madly-in-love Gallic youngsters rarely grow up. My Golden Days (Trois Souvenirs De Ma Jeunesse) from one of the Frenchest of French directors Arnaud Desplechin (A Christmas Tale Kings and Queen) is a prequel to his 1996 title My Sex Life... or How I Got Into an Argument and that films lead Mathieu Amalric is glimpsed here a few times reprising his role as the older Paul Dedalus. However the film belongs to hypnotic newcomer Quentin Dolmaire who plays Paul in the long flashbacks to his occasionally a even literally a golden-hued youth. As the English-language title and the French subtitle Our Arcadias suggests this is a film about adolescence seen with the benefit of a kind of melancholy hindsight even if no knowledge of Desplechins Sex Life is necessary to enjoy his latest. And though it doesnt skimp at all on rhapsodizing and philosophizing about love politics and identity in that endearingly earnest way that only teenagers (and French adults at least in the movies) are capable of Days is also one of the directors most heartfelt and accessible titles in well years. This can only be good news for an art house feature from an august director that besides those few scenes featuring Amalric features great newcomers but otherwise no marquee names. The film will be released in France on May 20. The French title which roughly translates to ""Three Memories from My Youth"" hints at the films three-part structure though the first two parts the brief ""Childhood"" and slightly longer ""Russia"" feel somewhat detached from the 90-minute third segment simply titled ""Esther."" The older Paul (Amalric) recalls his youth as hes returning from long years abroad to take up a desk job for the French government in Paris. ""I dont know who I am"" sighs Paul and hes not just referring to the fact that after a long period of careful planning he once ""lost"" his passport to a Jewish boy while on a school trip to the USSR. This memory is revealed in ""Russia"" an interlude that plays like an exciting Cold War-era story with Bond-like touches that reveals an event thatll echo throughout Pauls life and introduces the idea of double or potential paths not taken. See more Cannes The Red-Carpet Arrivals (Photos) The adult Dedalus will in fact become an anthropologist obsessed with the East -- the film opens in Tajikistan -- and with the areas where universal human behavior and cultural specifics intersect and diverge. Throughout young Dolmaire Desplechin and co-writer Julie Peyr (Jimmy P.) infuse Paul with a welcome immediacy and openness that gives him for example the courage as a teenager to walk up to the pretty Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet) and try to flirt with her while simultaneously talking about the fact he doesnt know how to flirt. Using his own insecurities to make her laugh and make her understand hes something of an open book he manages to charm her and the two will finally start a relationship that becomes one of the defining elements of his emotional life (those who have seen My Sex Life will recognize this films Esther as the younger version of the character earlier played by Emmanuelle Devos). Esther is mighty pretty but she isnt an easy girl. And other boys are interested in her too which complicates things when Paul moves away from provincial Roubaix to study in Paris. From then on their relationship is conducted mainly by phone and passionate letters forcing the youngsters to constantly try and put into words what they feel. The flashback structure suggests not only Pauls nostalgia for his own past but simultaneously reveals Desplechins yearning for the romantic realities of the pre-Internet age when long periods of absence of a loved one made the heart ache. Though the characters watch the fall of the Berlin Wall on TV -- one of the characters perceptively suggests its a symbol of the end of their childhood -- My Golden Days more often privileges emotional truths over historical veracity. This helps not only to make the past dilemmas of the protagonists feel more immediate and real but also suggests how looking back we see our lives as a succession of emotional experiences not dry historical facts. This is an entirely welcome development in the evolving oeuvre of an auteur whose filmography includes some films where the head was made to work much harder than the heart. All the actors a from Amalric here in his sixth collaboration with Desplechin a to the entire cast of youngsters most with next to no film experience inhabit their roles fully. Even the walk-on cameo of French veteran actor Andre Dussollier who plays a high-placed French government official is highly suggestive and fully inhabited. But theres no doubt that Roy-Lecollinet a and particularly Dolmaire a are the true stars of the film. Without their combustible rapport the narrative would lack any tension but thankfully their exchanges crackle with the excitement and callowness of youth and the naivety and certainty of inexperience all perceived through the lens of someone who fondly looks back on his formative years. In this regard Dolmaires work is especially impressive subtlety incorporating some of Amalrics speech patterns and mannerisms without ever simply aping the actor leaving some room for Paul to develop and grow in the intervening years that separate him from his older self. Beyond the occasionally literally golden light of Irina Lubtchanskys cinematography the idea of nostalgia is further reinforced by employing old school stylistic flourishes such as iris shots and having the actors recite their letters directly to the camera.
