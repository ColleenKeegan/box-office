If it falls short of doing for chopsocky cinema what ""Airplane"" did for the formerly friendly skies neither is Steve Oedekerks ""Kung Pow Enter the Fist"" the unwatchable embarrassment Fox clearly thought it had when the studio delayed its release and declined to screen it for the press (the first such picture of 2002). As a result of this strategy consistently silly and intermittently laugh-out-loud funny spoof will be consigned primarily to genre fans with cult biz and possible college drinking games erupting in ancillary. In much the same way Woody Allen re-recorded the dialogue and turned a 1964 Japanese spy movie into the egg salad intrigue epic ""Whats Up Tiger Lily?"" industrious hyphenate Oedekerk has sliced and diced the 1976 Mandarin-lingo ""Tiger amp; Crane Fists"" into an affectionate burlesque of martial arts sagas. Fresh pass at pic supplements vintage footage with newly shot sequences and the kind of surreal biologically oriented CGI helmers have been fooling with for some time now both in live action (the Ace Ventura and Nutty Professor franchises) and animation (""Thumb Wars"" and a handful of other recent ""filmettes""). Oedekerk essays the title role of the Chosen One with a Bruce Lee-Jackie Chan bowl cut glued to his head. Following an oddly serious title card reminding auds theyre watching an old movie redubbed prologue finds the infant Chosen One beating the crap out of Master Pain (Lung Fei). As a grown man ""Chosen"" as hes sometimes called must do battle with his evil nemesis who for some reason changes his name to Betty while protecting the dotty Master Tang (Chen Hui Lou). Along the way hes attracted to the flighty Ling (Hsieh Ling-ling) is advised by the mono-breasted mystery warrior Whoa (Jennifer Tung) and does battle with a very angry and tenacious cow. Finale finds him victorious over the unseen Evil Council which of course lives in France. Per Oedekerk new cast was supposed to speak alongside original thesps but he had such a ball dubbing everybody that his and Tungs voices are the only two heard -- except for Chosens faithful dog who obliges by barking out of sync. This helps to keep things moving as he freely mixes a broad range of accents and textures into the mix and even falls back on what sound like vocal exercises when all else fails. During the course of skewering most of the genres tropes the gags run the gamut from silly to the not-so-silly Theres a brief fake intermission Chosens facial contortions result in a popped blood vessel and Betty has a habit of pounding on Master Tang while a digitally added assistant plays ""U Cant Touch This"" and ""Baby Got Back"" on a boombox. Tech credits are purposefully and skillfully crummy with lenser John J. Connors distressed footage matching seamlessly with the original. Story actually ends at the 72-minute mark followed by a preview of the fictitious sequel ""Kung Pow II Tongue of Fury."" Outtakes staged gags and behind-the-scenes bluescreen sequences run under the credits during which a clapperboard bearing original title ""The Dubbed Action Movie"" can be seen. Pic bears a 2001 copyright and thanks Jimmy Wang Yu who helmed and starred in 1976 pic as well as the three original leads -- while clarifying that none of them had anything to do with this production.

Kim Fei Lung20th Century Fox Film Corporation D Kung Pow Enter the Fist Genre Comedy Action/Adventure; Starring Steve Oedekerk Tad Horino Joon B. Kim Fei Lung; Director Steve Oedekerk; Author Steve Oedekerk; Release Date Wide 01/25/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 81; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted February 8 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Steve Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams and Nutty Professor II The Klumps. He wrote and directed Ace Ventura 2 and Nothing to Lose. His audience does not prize subtlety; it prefers talking butt cheeks. But even hardcore Oedekerkians may roll their eyes during stretches of this processed comedy chop suey. Its a scrambled version of Tiger amp; Crane Fists a mediocre 1976 Hong Kong martial-arts flick that the writer-director-star has redubbed and digitally altered to suit the tastes of novices who have never seen Woody Allens Whats Up Tiger Lily? Or watched Mystery Science Theater 3000. Or Saturday Night Live. Or parodies of The Matrix and The Lion King. Or turned on a television. Oedekerk plays an orphan (raised by rodents) whos looking for the villain who killed his parents. During the long sequence in which the hero fights a digital cow with much attention paid to squirting udders why not take a break and purchase some Milk Duds.

The Chosen One (STEVE OEDEKERK) battles a masked foe. Kung Pow packed with cartoonish gags 1 / 1 Back to Gallery KUNG POW ENTER THE FIST Action spoof. Starring Steve Oedekerk. Directed and written by Steve Oedekerk. (PG-13. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Raised by rodents with no true home a man wanders the wilderness in search of the bandits who killed his parents and torched his home. His name is the Chosen One and hes the avenging kick-boxing hero of ""Kung Pow Enter the Fist"" a willfully dumb spoof of Hong Kong martial-arts flicks of the 70s. In a sense this really is a martial-arts film from the 70s. Writer- director Steve Oedekerk (""Ace Ventura 2 When Nature Calls"") found ""Tiger amp; Crane Fists"" an obscure 1976 karate movie redubbed it with an all-new soundtrack and digitally spliced in footage of himself as an inappropriately Caucasian hero. One neednt know the genre to get all the jokes but it helps. Instead of making one ham-handed zoom shot per scene Oedekerk tosses in a dozen in a row. Instead of making faces and waving his arms to assume a battle position Oedekerk scratches his butt and gives himself an animated tongue called Tonguey that has its own eyes and mouth. Its a bit like watching ""Whats Up Tiger Lily?"" the 1966 comedy that Woody Allen made by looping nonsensical dialogue into a cheap Japanese spy flick. Only Oedekerk (he also wrote ""Patch Adams"" and ""The Nutty Professor"") expands the level of appropriation re-creating the films sets at a Mexican location body-doubling the Hong Kong actors from the original film and adding new characters scenes and visual effects. Cultural massacre with a goony grin. The narrator has a Chicano accent brawny warriors are dubbed in ill-matching voices (nelly queen Southern goober) and the dialogue is amusing on a fifth-grade Mad magazine level (""Your story makes my heart heavy and my prostate weak"" or ""Let your anger be as a monkey in a pinata.""). Oedekerk does something else that starts out funny but turns dull He loops in dialogue as clumsily as possible so that words are never in sync with the actors lip movements. I saw the same gag on an ""SCTV"" spoof of Italian movies nearly 20 years ago; it worked better then. Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references ""Kung Pow"" is the kind of movie thats critic-proof simply because it aims so low. Who can get upset by a kick-boxing cow that uses its teats like fire hoses to mow down the Chosen One?

Like some Frankensteins monster of filmmaking this scattershot stab at comedy has been stitched together by its star and director Steve Oedekerk mainly from an obscure 1976 karate film Tiger and Crane Fists with new dialogue and sound dubbed over the original. The idea is one used to better effect by Mr. Allen in Whats Up Tiger Lily (1966) when he took over a low-grade 1964 Japanese spy movie and redubbed it to let the fate of the world hang on possession of an egg salad recipe. Mr. Oedekerk who is the writer of Kung Pow as well as its co-producer and dubber of most of its voices has availed himself of digital technology to insert himself into the old film as the new hero and to add scenes. The result has spirit without inspiration. Much like Harry Potter the hero of Kung Pow is orphaned as an infant when his parents are slain by the evil Master Pain but survives and grows up to learn that he is the Chosen One. Having been reared by rodents and having had to fight to survive the Chosen One wanders the landscape en route to the inevitable showdown with Master Pain also known as Master Betty who is in thrall to the Evil Council. Eventually the Chosen One finds his way to the martial arts academy run by the consumptive Master Tang falls in love with the beauteous but whiny Ling receives sage advice from the oracle Whoa she of the shifting monobreast and comes to the final showdown after raising his skills and felling bisexual bovines in mortal combat. As usual the fight scenes defy both gravity and credibility blood spurts good triumphs and viewers can get on with watching the outtakes. Kung Pow Enter the Fist is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Though the spirit of the violence is comic the combat is often bloody and cruel.
