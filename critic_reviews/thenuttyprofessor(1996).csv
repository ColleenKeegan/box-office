Arguably the greatest performer ever to emerge from Saturday Night Live he connected with audiences in the way that Richard Pryor and Woody Allen had; he made you feel as if your entire skeleton were made of funny bones. Then virtually overnight he imploded as a comedian. The slapdash awfulness of some of his movies (remember The Golden Child?) was insulting as if he were saying ""See Im such a big star I can do anything -- and youll line up for it"" The real downshift came with Beverly Hills Cop II a hunk of Simpson-Bruckheimer noise in which Murphy playing Axel Foley as a glowering supercop sadist virtually declared his lack of interest in making audiences laugh. He began to perform as if he wanted us to love him simply for being Eddie Murphy. His arrogance mutated into a contempt for comedy for entertainment for stardom itself. By the time the 90s rolled around he had turned into a steroid parody of himself hard and imperious where hed once been light and supple. Hed become an abstraction of celebrity -- ego without joy the strutting King of Nothing. Before long we forgot hed ever sat on a throne. So its only fitting perhaps that Eddie Murphy returns to show business -- that is to being a true entertainer -- a humbled man and whats more that this new modesty becomes the very source of his comedy. In The Nutty Professor a canny and exuberant update of the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy Murphy appears as seven different characters but mostly he plays Sherman Klump a hugely fat chemistry professor who longs to escape his load of misery. The makeup artist Rick Baker has given Murphy pouchy cheeks a drooping double chin and the body of a hippopotamus. Though Im not quite sure how he brought it off the effect is so convincing that Murphy effectively disappears inside that mountain of fake flesh. Sherman wears a bow tie a domesticated Afro and a smile of decorous politeness; he seems to be apologizing for his very existence. His obesity is so overstated so ridiculous so there that Murphys slyly witty performance can afford not to be ridiculous. Speaking in the courtly soft tones of a Southern gentleman he makes Sherman as lithe and unobtrusive in soul as he is heavy in body. Sherman would have been a fussbudget nerd even back in the 70s and in a sense hes still stuck in the post-civil rights era. A beneficent intelligence shines through Murphys liquid eyes and he gives Sherman a secret funky side. The moment Miss Purty (Jada Pinkett) a sexy new professor wanders into his classroom to introduce herself its clear that Sherman is comfortable with his libido; he just keeps it under wraps. At night he goes home and sings along with his Teddy Pendergrass CDs and his bull-in-the-china-shop dance moves are hilarious and touching. More than just a walking fat joke Sherman Klump is Eddie Murphys winking rebuke of his own arrogance. The characters blackness is central to the satire He represents a gleeful subversion of African-American machismo -- the blimp as ultimate unhipster. Out on a date with Miss Purty Sherman is ridiculed by an obnoxious nightclub comic (Dave Chappelle in an electric performance) and we share in his humiliation. But then he gets revenge. Using himself as a guinea pig in a mad scientist experiment he drinks a blue potion and emerges newly svelte as Buddy Love (i.e. Eddie Murphy sans makeup) badass lady-killer. The scene in which Sherman-as-Buddy returns to the nightclub for a duel with the comic is a tour de force of invective. As the movie goes on we realize that Buddy with his mile-wide grins his pimp suits his dismaying eagerness for everyone to share in the pleasure of what a sexed-up pig he is is Murphys hyperbolic act of self-mockery. In the original Nutty Professor Jerry Lewis Buddy Love -- a blend of Dean Martin and his own dark side -- was almost blasphemous in his arrogance. Murphy plays Buddy as an amusing projection of the ego Sherman is suppressing but in a strange way his Murphyish riffs are too familiar to shock us into laughter (as Lewis did). Then again the new movie is more than a Jekyll-and-Hyde farce. In addition to Sherman and Buddy Murphy plays four members of Shermans fat cantankerous family and in doing so he turns The Nutty Professor into a gloriously rowdy African-American burlesque. The characters around the dinner table range from a proudly flatulent father to a devious obscene grandma and every one of them will have audiences howling; you can feel Murphy rediscovering his joy as a performer. He rediscovers it too as Sherman Klump a fellow who much like Murphy is on the bottom rung desperate to reinvent himself and -- at long last -- does.

Its Murphys most assured work in some time. Hes not really kooky but Eddie Murphys reworking of Jerry Lewis 1963 film The Nutty Professor is an apt and comic update of the Jekyll/Hyde formula. Its Murphys most assured work in some time. Eschewing the revenge-of-the-nerds theme of the Lewis original the new version casts its title hero as a blimp-size pedagogue Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) is a good-hearted slightly absent-minded tub of lard conducting molecular research experiments at a fictional university. His goal is to find a solution that will make you thin and hes making significant strides towards that end with his lab hamsters. But the sedentary life that is his custom gets shaken with the arrival of Carla (Jada Pinkett) a comely grad student impressed by his work and seemingly undaunted by his girth. Shermans own self-image is at a decided low. The college dean (Larry Miller) has threatened to kill him if he alienates a big-bucks donor (James Coburn) and his rambunctious unschooled family goads him endlessly about his job and bachelorhood. The sober side of pic stands in sharp contrast to fitfully related sequences featuring the Klump brood. Murphy plays both of Shermans parents his grandma and brother. They are staccatos of well-observed painfully funny jibes that perk up the proceedings. Whats left of the supporting cast is also strong. Miller is at his obsequious best and Pinkett again unrecognizable from any previous role demonstrates that her range ranks her among the most versatile young performers in movies. 1996 Best Make-up (Matthew W.

Starring Eddie Murphy and Jada Pinkett . Directed by Tom Shadyac . (PG. 95 MINUTES. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres nothing complicated about ""The Nutty Professor"" the Eddie Murphy comedy that opens today at Bay Area theaters. Its a showcase for Murphy a chance to dazzle us with his comic virtuosity and a bid to resuscitate a seriously ailing career. Directed by Tom Shadyac the man who gave Jim Carrey a boost with ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" ""The Nutty Professor"" is a so-so remake of the 1964 Jerry Lewis comedy -- a ""Dr. Jekyll amp; Mr. Hyde"" takeoff about a geeky buck-toothed scientist who transforms himself into a slick lounge lizard. Related Stories FILM REVIEW -- Eddie Murphys Juicy Roles / `Nutty comedy good but falters In this version Murphy plays Sherman Klump a socially insecure 400- pound college professor who ingests his own gene-altering concoction and emerges as the slim Buddy Love. Silver-tongued and fast with the ladies Buddy Love is no stretch for Murphy; he plays him like a spoof of himself. Playing Klump is another deal. Wearing a huge body suit and facial prosthetics Murphy creates a character whos sweet brave and humble and nothing like the Eddie Murphy we know. Thats only for starters. In a pair of dinner-table scenes Murphy also plays Klumps grossly overeating flatulent family his fountain-of-love mama his crude dad his macho brother and his funky snaggle-toothed grandma. Each of the characters was filmed separately and then optically grafted in post-production. The seamless result is a tour-de-force for the energetic Murphy and an amazing display of his vocal and physical agility. Murphy also gets to goof on Richard Simmons when he plays TV exercise guru Lance Perkins. Thats seven characters in all. Move over Tracey Ullmann. Murphy is wonderful -- I wouldnt begrudge him an Oscar nomination -- but ""The Nutty Professor"" is a mess. One minute its making cruel fat jokes at Klumps expense; the next its asking us to embrace Klumps humanity and consider the warm genuine person inside. Shermans big challenge is learning to like himself and feel hes worthy of love. When a foxy chemistry professor played by Jada Pinkett takes an interest in him their first date is ruined by a night-club comic (Dave Chappelle) who picks Klump out from the crowd. ""I think I found where they hid Jimmy Hoffa"" the jokester screams when Klump bends over. ""You got more crack than Harlem"" Desperate to charm Pinkett Klump downs the formula that hes been using on hamsters and emerges as Buddy Love -- a too-feisty too-fine Lothario with a license plate reading ""PNS CAR."" In the movies best scene Buddy Love returns to the club where Sherman was so royally dissed and turns the tables on the comic (""Your mother so fat the b--get her toenails painted at Earl Scheib""). For the rest of the movie Sherman and Buddy alternate places like Clark Kent and Superman until Buddy loses control and tries to destroy Klump. In a confrontation thats reminiscent of Steve Martin fighting a second spirit in his body in ""All of Me"" the two personalities vie for domination and start a battle of cross-metamorphosis. Without Murphy ""The Nutty Professor"" is practically worthless. Theres a sentimental love-the-inner-man message at the end but it feels hypocritical after 95 minutes of fatty barbs. Not that moral uplift is the point here This is a chance to see Murphy doing what he does best and for that alone its worth seeing.

"Nutty Professor The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nutty-professor-the ) Nutty Professor The (United States 1996) A movie review by James Berardinelli Eddie Murphy does not make ""comebacks"" because according to him he hasnt been out of the spotlight. But following three critical and box-office flops (The Distinguished Gentleman Beverly Hills Cop III and Vampire in Brooklyn) Murphy is hoping The Nutty Professor gets his career back on track. Combining his own brand of high-energy comedy with that of Ace Ventura veterans Tom Shadyac and Steve Oederkerk Murphy is attempting to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. And while the flatulence-joke lovers who flocked to Dumb and Dumber will doubtless be overwhelmed not to mention doubled-over by this movie those hoping for more cerebral humor are destined to be disappointed. The Nutty Professor aims for guffaws at the lowest level -- anyone with a double-digit IQ will get every joke. Whether you laugh at them or not is often more of a matter of taste than a question of having a sense of humor. Murphy is very funny giving his most manic inspired performance in years and playing no less than seven different roles. Too often however the script lets him down. Ill admit to laughing a number of times but I couldnt help noticing all the squandered opportunities. The Nutty Professor should have been funnier than it is but by concentrating on bodily function humor the film makers have limited Murphys effectiveness. This version of The Nutty Professor is loosely based on the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy about a nerd inventing a potion that turns him into a lothario. That story in turn was a reworking of Robert Louis Stevensons The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Its interesting that in the last twelve months weve seen three interpretations of this story. And while The Nutty Professor isnt nearly as impressive as Stephen Frears eerie atmospheric Mary Reilly its infinitely more watchable than 1995s Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde. Curiously for a tale known best for its horrific elements none of these movies fits into the traditional horror genre -- two are comedies and the other is a drama. Murphy plays mild-mannered Sherman Klump a 400-pound science professor at Wellman College. One day the gorgeous willowy Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett) walks through the door to Shermans classroom and introduces herself as one of his biggest fans. The poor professor is instantly smitten and embarks on a campaign to shed his extra pounds. Day-after-day he works out but an opportunity in his lab presents him with a quicker easier way to shape up. A serum for re-aligning genetic structure has worked marvels for hamsters so Sherman decides to become a human subject. Moments after gulping down the light blue contents of a vial the overweight scientist has been replaced by his svelte well-toned alternate self Buddy Love. But along with Buddys perfect physique comes a nasty out-of-control personality. When its not concentrating on members of Shermans family passing gas belching or threatening to sneeze all over the dinner table some of the comedy is cute. For example in a nightmare sequence where Sherman imagines himself to be King Kong his goal when reaching through the window of a skyscraper isnt the girl its a roast turkey. Among the other memorable sequences are an amusing takeoff on From Here to Eternity and the nicely-choreographed climactic ""battle"" between Sherman and Buddy. Theres an underlying message in The Nutty Professor about self-respect and accepting people as they are (oddly this is the same theme advanced by Disneys The Hunchback of Notre Dame). Because Murphys performance as Sherman makes us care about the character its easy to sympathize with his plight. Unfortunately this aspect of the story which is the most touching is skimmed over presumably because the material is too heavy for a comedy. Worse still the presence of so many barbed fat jokes makes it easy to suspect The Nutty Professor of conflicted motives. The visual effects are top-rate recalling Jim Carreys The Mask. With the help of makeup guru Rick Baker Murphy is equally believable as the hulking Sherman his doddering grandmother a Richard Simmons look-alike and the slim-and-trim Buddy Love. Its a tour-de-force for the comic and that almost makes The Nutty Professor worth seeing. Alas this movie is a little too interested in easy jokes to bother with having a heart. And in the end were not sure whether were supposed to be cheering for Sherman or laughing at him.

Arguably the greatest performer ever to emerge from Saturday Night Live he connected with audiences in the way that Richard Pryor and Woody Allen had; he made you feel as if your entire skeleton were made of funny bones. Then virtually overnight he imploded as a comedian. The slapdash awfulness of some of his movies (remember The Golden Child?) was insulting as if he were saying ""See Im such a big star I can do anything -- and youll line up for it"" The real downshift came with Beverly Hills Cop II a hunk of Simpson-Bruckheimer noise in which Murphy playing Axel Foley as a glowering supercop sadist virtually declared his lack of interest in making audiences laugh. He began to perform as if he wanted us to love him simply for being Eddie Murphy. His arrogance mutated into a contempt for comedy for entertainment for stardom itself. By the time the 90s rolled around he had turned into a steroid parody of himself hard and imperious where hed once been light and supple. Hed become an abstraction of celebrity -- ego without joy the strutting King of Nothing. Before long we forgot hed ever sat on a throne. So its only fitting perhaps that Eddie Murphy returns to show business -- that is to being a true entertainer -- a humbled man and whats more that this new modesty becomes the very source of his comedy. In The Nutty Professor a canny and exuberant update of the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy Murphy appears as seven different characters but mostly he plays Sherman Klump a hugely fat chemistry professor who longs to escape his load of misery. The makeup artist Rick Baker has given Murphy pouchy cheeks a drooping double chin and the body of a hippopotamus. Though Im not quite sure how he brought it off the effect is so convincing that Murphy effectively disappears inside that mountain of fake flesh. Sherman wears a bow tie a domesticated Afro and a smile of decorous politeness; he seems to be apologizing for his very existence. His obesity is so overstated so ridiculous so there that Murphys slyly witty performance can afford not to be ridiculous. Speaking in the courtly soft tones of a Southern gentleman he makes Sherman as lithe and unobtrusive in soul as he is heavy in body. Sherman would have been a fussbudget nerd even back in the 70s and in a sense hes still stuck in the post-civil rights era. A beneficent intelligence shines through Murphys liquid eyes and he gives Sherman a secret funky side. The moment Miss Purty (Jada Pinkett) a sexy new professor wanders into his classroom to introduce herself its clear that Sherman is comfortable with his libido; he just keeps it under wraps. At night he goes home and sings along with his Teddy Pendergrass CDs and his bull-in-the-china-shop dance moves are hilarious and touching. More than just a walking fat joke Sherman Klump is Eddie Murphys winking rebuke of his own arrogance. The characters blackness is central to the satire He represents a gleeful subversion of African-American machismo -- the blimp as ultimate unhipster. Out on a date with Miss Purty Sherman is ridiculed by an obnoxious nightclub comic (Dave Chappelle in an electric performance) and we share in his humiliation. But then he gets revenge. Using himself as a guinea pig in a mad scientist experiment he drinks a blue potion and emerges newly svelte as Buddy Love (i.e. Eddie Murphy sans makeup) badass lady-killer. The scene in which Sherman-as-Buddy returns to the nightclub for a duel with the comic is a tour de force of invective. As the movie goes on we realize that Buddy with his mile-wide grins his pimp suits his dismaying eagerness for everyone to share in the pleasure of what a sexed-up pig he is is Murphys hyperbolic act of self-mockery. In the original Nutty Professor Jerry Lewis Buddy Love -- a blend of Dean Martin and his own dark side -- was almost blasphemous in his arrogance. Murphy plays Buddy as an amusing projection of the ego Sherman is suppressing but in a strange way his Murphyish riffs are too familiar to shock us into laughter (as Lewis did). Then again the new movie is more than a Jekyll-and-Hyde farce. In addition to Sherman and Buddy Murphy plays four members of Shermans fat cantankerous family and in doing so he turns The Nutty Professor into a gloriously rowdy African-American burlesque. The characters around the dinner table range from a proudly flatulent father to a devious obscene grandma and every one of them will have audiences howling; you can feel Murphy rediscovering his joy as a performer. He rediscovers it too as Sherman Klump a fellow who much like Murphy is on the bottom rung desperate to reinvent himself and -- at long last -- does.
