She goes one better here describing with surprising elan the world of the poor young male Venice Beach skating crew that joined the competition team set up in the late 1970s by spaced-out surfer-dude Skip Engblom - an almost unrecognisable and enjoyably OTT Heath Ledger - to rock the sport to its concrete foundations.  Skater-turned-filmmaker Stacy Peralta outlined his own and his mates bruised rise to cult stardom in the 2001 doc Dogtown and Z-Boys. The fact that he has written the script here - his fictionalised self played by silver-locked John Robinson is one of the central foursome alongside commercially-savvy Tony (Victor Rasuk) loose-cannon Jay (Emile Hirsch) and Sid (Michael Angarano) - may explain a slight swerve towards hagiography. But it could be worse. Allowing for the hermetic in-talk product-placement and self-aggrandisement (hordes of tactile bikini-clad girls seem to reward every 480 degree turn or special grind) this is a decent if unsophisticated kids-eye melodrama. Hardwicke keeps her cast at ease during their group interactions (though its no Santa Monica Diner) while parents are either irrelevant obtuse or dysfunctional Rebecca de Mornay plays Jays mom like an ageing bimbo from Altmans The Long Goodbye. The rush is in the mainly excellent sports footage from the opening road-level-shot descent to the sentimental for-old-times-sake swimming pool swoops at the end.

"Dogtown Travels the Same Ramp washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Dogtown Travels the Same Ramp Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 3 2005 Think of ""Lords of Dogtown"" a fictionalized account of the rise of skateboarding culture in late-1970s Venice Calif. as a chewable vitamin. Its not bad for you to be sure. Its even fun. But its certainly less um hardcore than the real deal which in this case is an excellent 2001 documentary called ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" whose nutritional content ""Lords"" largely apes with some dramatic license. Now a lot of folks simply find certain things unpalatable -- documentaries old black-and-white movies foreign films -- and if it takes a Hollywood remake or a dramatization to get them to sit down and listen to the story well whatre you gonna do? Directed by Catherine Hardwicke of ""Thirteen"" fame and written by Stacy Peralta the skateboarder/surfer-turned-filmmaker who also directed and co-wrote the earlier film ""Lords of Dogtown"" at least maintains the same manic transgressive energy of the documentary which as Peralta notes on the commentary track of that films DVD was anything but ""stuffy methodical and slow."" Like the wild long-haired teenagers who are its subject ""Lords"" is rude aggressive and disrespectful of authority. Its dirty loud randy obnoxious destructive and at times clinically insane. All of which is precisely what is best about the movie whose shaky hand-held camerawork gives it ironically . . . a documentary feel. Whats not so great is the Hollywood-ification of the story. Although it follows the skateboarding facts pretty accurately -- the discovery of urethane wheels; the borrowing of skateboarding moves from surfing cut-backs; the California drought and the use of empty swimming pools as skate parks; and the professionalization of what had been a rebellious hobby into big business -- the emphasis on such melodrama as a love triangle and an increasingly sick kid (Michael Angarano) lend the film a soap-operatic quality it doesnt need. At the center of the story are ""Z-boys"" Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) based on the real-life members of a skateboarding team sponsored by the local Zephyr surf shop and its deliciously addled proprietor Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger). Against a backdrop of ever-more-mainstream skateboarding competitions where the wave-based stylistic innovations of the Z-boys initially blew their fuddy-duddy competitors out of the water so to speak friendships that began on the streets of Dogtown (the slum-like section of Venice) slowly begin to unravel. Tony goes after money forgoing his old pals in favor of fancy clothes cars and women offered by a Mephistophelean promoter (Johnny Knoxville). Jay steals Stacys girlfriend (""Thirteens"" Nikki Reed) then loses his focus -- and natural athleticism -- to the temptations of gang life. Through it all however only Stacy remains steadfast. It is I suppose the prerogative of the writer to make himself the hero but at times the young Peralta comes across as a kind of adolescent Jesus in a sweatband beautiful blond centered and slightly nerdlike. For the inside skateboarding crowd Hardwicke and Peralta scatter several cameo appearances by the characters real-life counterparts and other skateboarding luminaries throughout the film. Peralta himself for instance has a walk-on playing the director of a ""Charlies Angels"" episode in which he starred as a teen and Tony Hawk the skateboarding superstar who was subsequently discovered and promoted by Peralta after he left competitive skateboarding plays an astronaut who falls off a skateboard. Cute stuff. Its not that ""Lords of Dogtown"" isnt any good. Its fine and full of life. Its just that when interest first arose about making a movie about this story after a 1999 article about the history of the Z-boys appeared in Spin magazine Peralta says he wanted to make a documentary first that would get the story right. He did and its perfect in every way. ""Lords of Dogtown"" isnt a cop-out but rather an ever-so-slight concession to commercialism while ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" was above all else a love song to the counterculture.

"Been There Done That Better Two Genre-Switching Flicks washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Been There Done That Better Two Genre-Switching Flicks Paul Green right with young C.J. in the semi-flat documentary ""Rock School."" (By Don Argott) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 3 2005 This week marks a telling convergence in movie theaters the opening of a documentary that bears more than a passing resemblance to a wildly appealing fiction film and the opening of a fiction film based on a fabulous documentary. Considering the widening artistic and commercial scope of nonfiction movies it stands to reason that Hollywood would want to take another bite of those apples with a glossed-up fictionalized version. And what more promising prospect for a first-time documentary filmmaker than to make the real-life analogue of one of those glossy fictionalized star vehicles? But if the documentary ""Rock School"" and the fiction film ""Lords of Dogtown"" are any indication the theory that what works as nonfiction will work as fiction -- and vice versa -- may need a little tweaking. ""Rock School"" is Don Argotts cinema verite portrait of Paul Green a guitar player who opened an after-school program for Philadelphia youngsters eager to perfect their arpeggios and heavy metal scowls. Jack Black fans will surely be reminded of one of his beloved characters Dewey Finn the manic sweetly subversive teacher in Richard Linklaters wonderful 2003 comedy ""The School of Rock."" (That movie and Christopher Guests ""A Mighty Wind"" are the two titles I most regret not putting on my Top 10 list that year.) But whereas Blacks lovable trickster -- a lethally funny combination of Mephistopheles the Cat in the Hat and Ozzy Osbourne -- was an appealing evangelist for rock-and-roll excess and the sheer fun of shameless posing Green is a grim martinet given to chair-throwing tantrums and fits of temper that look suspiciously choreographed for the camera. Whats more until the last 20 minutes or so of ""Rock School"" the actual playing while often startlingly good is kind of boring. In actuality Linklaters movie wasnt based on Greens eponymous School of Rock Music; Argott himself learned of Green before ""The School of Rock"" came out. And its understandable why Argott a first-time filmmaker was attracted to his subject. Following a group of students over a few months as they practice mess up fight with Green and finally give their Big Performance suggests a virtually irresistible narrative arc. Argott wisely focuses on students who are either prodigiously gifted -- such as a 12-year-old guitar whiz named C.J. and a Sheryl Crow acolyte named Madi-- or compulsively camera-friendly like 9-year-old twins Asa and Tucker Collins a brother and sister whose stage mother veers more toward AC/DC than ""Annie."" The most compelling student is a depressive bespectacled teenager named Will OConnor. ""If it werent for Rock School . . . Id probably be dead"" he says at one point. ""Im barely alive now."" Will young Mr. OConnor shock everyone and actually play a note on the bass? Will the Collins twins nail their big Black Sabbath solos? Will C.J. overcome surgery on his leg to perform a note-for-note Carlos Santana riff on ""Black Magic Woman""? Youd be surprised at how little you care by the time Green whose speeches to the camera often teeter on the brink of Spinal Tappish self-importance kicks a wall or upbraids a student for the umpteenth time. For me ""Rock School"" only really got started once Greens master class which in his wisdom hes been immersing in Frank Zappa gears up to play Zappas enormously difficult and intricate ""Inca Roads"" at an annual festival in Germany. Their climactic performance may well be thrilling but do yourself a favor and rent Linklaters ""School of Rock"" for pure kick-out-the-jams fun. One movie that did make it on to my Top 10 list in 2001 was ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" Stacy Peraltas brilliant documentary about the Zephyr team a group of young skateboarders who in the 1970s burst out of the ""seaside slum"" of Venice Calif. to revolutionize the sport. With its edgy visual style classic 70s-rock soundtrack and former Z-Boy Peraltas own intimate knowledge of the subject ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" was one of those rare films fiction or nonfiction that transcended their putative subjects to address something much bigger in this case the uniquely American dreams of freedom unfettered self-invention and the vagrant creative genius of the outlaw. Thats the lightning Peralta and director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") have tried to bottle in ""Lords of Dogtown"" which has all the energy and spontaneity of a bowl of waxed fruit. If watching ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" was tantamount to witnessing history itself watching ""Lords of Dogtown"" which Peralta wrote feels more like watching a stiff meticulously choreographed reenactment. Admittedly Hardwicke has enlisted a spot-on cast of young actors to portray Peralta and his fellow Z-Boy stars Tony Alva and Jay Adams. John Robinson (""Elephant"") Victor Rasuk (""Raising Victor Vargas"") and Emile Hirsch (""Imaginary Heroes"") play Peralta Alva and Adams respectively and each bears an eerie physical resemblance to his character. Its more difficult to recognize the Z-Boys patron and self-described Captain Hook Skip Engblom in Heath Ledgers clench-jawed perpetually drunk loser. Engblom who was one of several surprisingly erudite commentators in ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" here is portrayed as if hes been up for days doing coke and swigging booze; that might jibe with the man who squandered a chance to succeed alongside his young proteges but it doesnt quite do justice to what he achieved. Hardwicke a former production designer does her best to approximate the ragged visual style of ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" using lots of close-ups and hand-held camera movements; it only makes ""Lords of Dogtown"" seem all the more inauthentic the aesthetic equivalent of slumming. Worse is Peraltas script which favors such Andy Hardyesque lines as ""Theyre urethane its made of oil"" and ""We cant bail on Skip man hes family."" Part of what made the Z-Boy movement great was the fact that it had two tireless historians the designer Craig Stecyk and the photographer Glen Freidman. Since they obsessively recorded every moment of the Z-Boys rise to skateboard stardom -- from surfing off Venices fabled Pacific Ocean Park pier to sticking urethane wheels on their skateboards to perfect their moves in Los Angeless drought-drained swimming pools -- Peraltas documentary gave viewers the feeling that they were watching something being born before their very eyes. In ""Lords of Dogtown"" the gloriously random factors that converged to create the Z-Boy phenomenon are all conveyed through awkward expository bits of dialogue with the result being that what should have been the ""Boogie Nights"" of skateboarding is instead its ""Knute Rockne All American."" In the argot of the Z-Boys themselves it is so not punk rock. Rock School (93 minutes at Landmarks Bethesda Row Cineplex Odeon Dupont and Cineplex Odeon Shirlington) is rated R for profanity. Lords of Dogtown (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for drug and alcohol content sexuality violence brief profanity and reckless behavior all involving teens.

Unleashed Heath Ledger is among the skateboarders who take advantage of a drought -- and all those drained swimming pools. Columbia TriStar Pictures Were talking skateboarders -- specifically those of mid-1970s Southern California lore as portrayed in Dogtown and Z-Boys and now in a dramatized rendering that in many ways replicates that justifiably praised 2001 documentary. Lords of Dogtowns claim to authenticity is that its screenplay is by Stacy Peralta --Z-Boys director and a member of the films profiled Zephyr (thats the ""Z"") skate team. Lords director is onetime production designer Catherine Hardwicke and this is a huge reason this melancholy saga about specialized celebrity is of interest. Hardwicke directed 2003s Thirteen one of the great debut features of the past 20 years and her follow-up has the same impassioned empathy for the unpolished and dispossessed the kids for whom Stanford does not beckon. (Related video Watch the Lords of Dogtown trailer) About the movie Lords of Dogtown    (out of four) Stars Emile Hirsch Victor Rasuk John Robinson Heath Ledger Rebecca De Mornay Nikki Reed Johnny Knoxville Director Catherine Hardwicke Distributor Columbia Pictures Running time 1 hour 47 minutes Rated PG-13 for drug and alcohol content sexuality violence language and reckless behavior  all involving teens. Opens Friday nationwide After some conventional surfing catching waves that have lost their blue under the sooty piers of Venice the Dogtown gang takes advantage of a drought that required people to drain backyard swimming pools providing them endless arenas for skating. Invading these (much) higher-rent neighborhoods the members skate across and soar vertically up their side surfaces one-by-one -- recalling Burt Lancasters suburban pool odyssey in the movie based on John Cheevers short story The Swimmer. But this movie has fewer martini breaks. Lords predominantly young cast has a few familiar faces including Emile Hirsch from The Girl Next Door and Nikki Reed from Thirteen. But its characterizations tend to be sketchy even though the story is about how the skaters acted individually to fame both fleeting and permanent thanks to splashy skateboarding contests magazine covers and endorsements. Heath Ledger is a keen acting surprise. With an assist from so much scruffy hair that I didnt recognize him his acting is credible as the proprietor of a surfing/skateboarding shop (and a neighborhood fixture) who has some demons. Hardwicke is a comer and her storytelling has the rawness required. But its legitimate to ask how necessary this movie is when Z-Boys (with a second expanded DVD just out) spun the yarn so well. Still the skating scenes are their own reward Its hard to think of a movie since 1950s Sunset Boulevard that has gotten more dramatic impact out of a pool.

(Columbia/TriStar Pictures/Jaimie Trueblood) In this photo provided by Columbia/TriStar Pictures Heath Ledger stars as Skip Engblom in ""Lords of Dogtown. (Columbia/TriStar Pictures/Jaimie Trueblood) Photo JAIMIE TRUEBLOOD Skateboard flick Dogtown shreds plot movie cliches 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Lords of Dogtown Drama. Starring John Robinson Emile Hirsch Rebecca DeMornay and Heath Ledger. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. (Rated PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Woe to any filmgoer who pays attention to the movie trailers and buys a ticket to ""Lords of Dogtown"" expecting the skateboard version of ""Point Break."" Written by skating pioneer Stacy Peralta the new movie doesnt have much interest in the Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves universe of big action sequences highly skilled slow-motion lovemaking or even storytelling with a clear beginning middle and end. Peralta has instead crafted a strong companion to ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" his 2001 documentary about the 1970s skateboarding revolution in the slums near Venice (Los Angeles County). Peralta uses the creative liberties of fiction to focus on the one thing he couldnt convey in his historical record -- the sense of tribalism among skateboarders who live by a code that most law-abiding citizens misunderstand for hooliganism. ""Lords of Dogtown"" starts at roughly the midpoint of ""Dogtown and Z-Boys "" as the young members of the Zephyr skateboarding team are about to be discovered. The most fascinating parts of Peraltas documentary -- including the invention of urethane wheels and the drought conditions that led to a city filled with empty and very skateable swimming pools -- are background noise in ""Lords"" which focuses on the rise of teen phenoms Tony Alva Jay Adams and a young Peralta. Instead of a clear narrative arc ""Lords of Dogtown"" follows seemingly random events from the boys lives whether its a party at the local surf shop a few clumsy sexual encounters or one skaters visit to the lamp factory where his mother works. Characters are introduced and never seen again. Conflicts are started and never resolved. But the end result is a distancing from the manipulations of Hollywood and a feeling of what its like to be a young artist who must deal with the corrupting power of money and fame. Director Catherine Hardwickes abrupt segues and dead-end plot turns are hard to get used to but she works well with her talented group of young actors. Emile Hirsch as Adams is particularly memorable as the skater who acts the craziest but is also the most loyal to the unwritten Z-Boy rules. The Z- Boys were a pack and that bonding made them more similar than different. But all of the young actors distinguish themselves in a movie that doesnt indulge in stereotypes to help the audience keep track of whos who. Theyre particularly good in the most focused and funniest scene -- where the boys infiltrate a contest filled with un-hip skaters who approach the sport like synchronized swimmers. The biggest problems in ""Lords of Dogtown"" come with the adult actors who often act like theyre auditioning for a different movie. Heath Ledger as the Finian-esque surf shop owner Skip Engblom seems to be channeling ""The Doors""-era Val Kilmer -- providing comic relief and little else. Worse yet is Johnny Knoxville as a sugar-daddy skateboard mogul who channels the pimpish Vince Vaughn character from the recent ""Be Cool."" The filmmakers also abide by the Tony Hawk Mandatory Cameo Act of 1997 which was set up by legislators to ensure the celebritys whimsical appearance in every skateboard-related movie TV show video game and podcast. (Rebecca DeMornay shows up as well and judging by the weathered state of her skin shes spent every minute since ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" exposing herself on a beach somewhere near the equator.) The lack of a story stands out at the beginning of the movie where audiences may struggle to get used to the pace. It also becomes an issue near the end when its clear that the story will finish without a big payoff. Still the mood is right throughout ""Lords of Dogtown."" There are a few more Jethro Tull T-shirts than audiences may remember from the 1970s but otherwise the clothes and the music and the personalities are perfect. Most movies about that era treat the trends as satire and most movies about extreme sports are filled with one-dimensional characters. ""Lords of Dogtown"" avoids both and the end result is solid entertainment about a group of underdogs who introduced the world to a new kind of art. -- Advisory This film contains drug use violence profanity and suggestions of sex among minors.

By  Michael Booth PUBLISHED June 1 2005 at 256 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 931 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive linemen can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Without an intact marriage or trusted authority figure remotely in sight ""Lords of Dogtown"" is above all things a movie about the ideal family. It pretends to be about skateboarding about fame about Southern California about a subculture. But because director Catherine Hardwicke understands the joys and fears of teenage life her accomplished film explores the search for a safe nest as thoroughly as it defends the right to take flight. Hardwickes adolescent skate-heads drink toke have sex and punch referees. What they most long for though is someone they believe in to pat them on the back or guide them out into the open air. Americas concrete jungles are no place to grow up without a lucid parent or loyal friend. Hardwicke and screenwriter Stacy Peralta succeed with their yearning tale even as they race through the engrossing story of the 1970s boy-kings of hardcore skateboarding. ""Lords of Dogtown"" vividly recreates the lives of Peralta and his Venice Calif. buddies as they invent the street tricks that revived skateboarding and created alternative superstars with big-buck endorsement deals. Peralta told parts of this tale in ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" his popular 2001 documentary. But grainy home video cant go inside the broken homes that produced a generation of anti-hero athletes. So he wrote down the unvarnished private moments of pioneers Tony Alva Jay Adams Skip Engblom and himself eventually finding Hardwicke to turn his documentary into faithful fiction. Heath Ledger as Engblom steals the show from his younger champions playing the Zephyr Boys mentor with trippy aplomb. Engblom ran the surf shop that sponsored the boys groundbreaking skate team and a substance-enhanced Ledger alternates between encouraging the boys and exploiting them. Engblom was tortured a free spirit never quite able to surf away from responsibility. Thanks to Ledgers skills we can see awe give way to envy behind Engbloms sunglasses. ""Heres our entry fees now wheres our trophies"" shouts Engblom as he leads the boys into their first competition. Afterward in a celebration at a diner Engblom gives a profane speech that offers his skaters a reassuring flash of paternalism. Ledgers performance might be lost if the young cast wasnt convincing enough to fuel his hazy greed. But Hardwicke a surfer herself who lives on Venices prime Dogtown block chose actors who could sell the skate. John Robinson of Gus Van Sants ""Elephant"" is a spooky reincarnation of Peralta his blond hippie hair contrasting sharply with his attitude as the most straitlaced Z-Boy. Victor Rasuk as fame-loving Tony Alva plays up the playboy but an edginess to his good looks helps him stay real when the neighborhood needs him. Emile Hirsch may be the most impressive as rebel Jay Adams shedding the doughy inertia of his ""Imaginary Heroes"" role to recreate a genuine skate punk. A side benefit is the chance to watch a new sport and a new kind of celebrity invented from the asphalt up. This may never happen again - brave kids spinning around drained swimming pools not because cameras are watching but simply because they can. These days ESPN2 would be on the Z-Boys before they could swap out their first set of worn wheels. We are no longer a culture where kinetic creativity develops unseen at its own pace. Hardwickes storytelling feels a bit padded in the second half influenced too much by the formula of breakup-and-reunion mythologized for us by VH1. But we linger through the end to see the outcome for our concrete rebels and were rewarded with the knowledge that many of the Z-Boys helped make the movie. They still skate they still surf they still see each other. They still fight and still trade crazy-stupid ideas. Almost like a family.

Players of the titular game win cash by accepting increasingly reckless dares delivered via smartphone in front of a digital audience. Movie review In ""Bad Moms"" fast food booze spike the stress of motherhood July 29 2016 ""Bad Moms"" doesnt kick into gear until three mothers fed up with the stress of helicopter parenting and the unrealistic expectations of a draconian PTA president walk into a bar. One shot leads to another and pretty soon theyre discussing their most seductive fantasies. Movie review Silly gives way to outlandish in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" July 29 2016 Ricky Baker is an orphaned juvenile delinquent a ""real bad egg"" as an onscreen title announces in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" Taika Waititis endearingly playful adventure tale set in the New Zealand bush. In Jason Bourne a familiar if darker tale in a post-Edward Snowden world July 29 2016 Aside from updating to todays surveillance state ""Jason Bourne"" largely sticks to the franchises familiar moves and they often dont have the same kinetic finesse they used to.

The camera sharing the high threads its way through a double row of cars and its like a moment out of a Jerry Bruckheimer chase thriller except that theres nothing at all fanciful or exaggerated about it. The sequence gives you a charge because its entirely real -- a God-on-the-streets-eye view of skateboard heaven. The year is 1975 and the daredevil boarders -- Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) -- are the original skate punks. Theyre from Venice and Santa Monica a.k.a. Dogtown a rough-and-tumble ""ghetto by the sea"" thats nevertheless been touched by the stoned karma of surf culture. The surfers macho as bikers are a fading breed but the skateboarders are too young to have tasted the 60s. Theyre disaffected hippie fallout the long-haired sleepy children of divorce and drugs and they translate surf moves -- the extremes of balance and plunging bravado -- from water to concrete. They take a pastime thats little more than a hula hoop novelty and turn it into a sexy thrashing assertion of underground style. Lords of Dogtown is a docudrama rare in its grit and authenticity that also strives for the mythical youth-rebel excitement of something like 8 Mile. The film was written by Peralta himself and it stays extremely close to the events laid out in his superb 2002 documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys. We see the introduction of urethane wheels which allow the skaters to grip any surface and we meet Skip Engblom the bedraggled burnout of a surf-shop owner who organizes the kids into the Zephyr Team which becomes their debauched surrogate family. Skip is played by Heath Ledger who gives a witty performance as a sloshed old lion who still has some bite left. The first time the Z-Boys show up at a competition skating to Black Sabbath its hilarious -- theyre like devil hooligans invading a garden party. But they become a sensation. You might say that theyre escaping the reality of their lives except that the director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) shows you how skateboarding for these kids is reality -- the only one they care about. When they sneak into emptied-out swimming pools during a Southern California drought riding their boards up and over the walls of the curvy smooth basins its because theyre looking for a more bone-jangling rush a way to cut through the numbness to vent their aggression as they soar. The pools become bowls of vertical bliss. Hardwicke is the rare director whose work is at once kinesthetic and delicate. She stages Lords of Dogtown with a rushing caught-on-the-fly realism that may in the end prove more artful than commercial yet she makes her characters vibrant and full. The contrasting temperaments of the brash moonstruck Tony the chivalrous Stacy and the moody troubled Jay come to the fore gradually as theyre confronted with success. The three become stars boy kings of the 70s media/endorsement culture and in different ways it tears each of them apart. But that the movie says is tied to the nature of what they invented a sport that never had any motive beyond the go-for-broke impulse of flying off the next curve.

As long as the skateboarding rules in ""Lords of Dogtown"" this saga stays close to the essential vibe of the exploits of a rag-tag Venice crew profiled in Stacy Peraltas scintillating docu ""Dogtown and Z-Boys."" But its a wipeout once the pic skids into melodrama and an overly schematic sense of how success tore the group apart. That Peralta wrote the script -- his first drama after a series of fine docs -- will have cache among the alternative sports crowd. But will such an aud bother showing up at theaters or will it just wait for the video? The irony within the gang of surfers/skateboarders who hung around Skip Engbloms Zephyr surf shop in 1975 is that despite their refusal to follow societys rules they were just as easily sucked into dreams of material success as the next guy. Any dramatic re-telling has to be about more than just this yet ""Lords"" remains superficial and disconcertingly conventional. Rags-to-riches ride starts in 1975 as Stacy (John Robinson in long blonde locks as Peraltas younger self) Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) vie for space on the waves crashing dangerously close to the Pacific Ocean Park pier near Venice Calif. a ruin of a once-splendid oceanfront amusement park. Proving themselves on the pipe to grizzled vets including Skip (Heath Ledger) the trio also leads a pack of skateboarders applying the principles of surfing to the street. This crucial concept of surfing culture defining skateboarding culture so evocatively explained in Peraltas docu is only implied here so that we see the natural flow from water to concrete as little more than dudes with all the time in the world pulling outrageous stunts in alleys and thoroughfares. Skips breakthrough is scoring some polyurethane tires that allow the guys to go vertical and its hard to know whos more excited -- the Pied Piper-like Skip and his merry band or director Catherine Hardwicke whose cameras are right there with bonus cutaways to p.o.v. shots from the wheels angle. Hardwickes filmmaking deliberately recalls a loose even agreeably sloppy style common to 70s pics by Jerry Schatzberg and Monte Hellman about characters on the social margins. When the Zephyr team (or Z-Boys) blow away the plodding competition in a Del Mar tourney the sequence is like a celebration of radical and sexy sports bravado winning over hearts and minds. Piece de resistance though is a rollicking section devoted to the clans discovery of backyard pools drained during a mid-70s Southern California water shortage and how the kidney shape and sharp bowl design is the perfect skating rink for some unbelievable moves (all of them superbly cut and shot to match famous photos of the time and seamlessly blending stunt doubles and thesps). But various personal dramas are fitfully developed and pics energy dissipates. Jays character dominates from his inability to hook up with Tonys foxy sister Kathy (Nikki Reed who debuted in Hardwickes ""Thirteen"") to his growing alienation as Tony and Stacy cash in on their newfound fame as skateboarding stars. Peralta fails to give his autobiographical self any identity at all except as a dude who has to prove himself to earn a spot on the squad. As Tony Stacy and other Zephyr kids (most of whom arent sketched in) land on magazine covers and score top-dollar contracts Jay and Skip plunge into depressed stasis. Jays inability to parlay the Z-Boys winning streak into a pro career is a key element the film fails to explore in a satisfying way. He may be dragged down by his impoverished hippie mom Philaine (Rebecca De Mornay in a wonderfully committed perf) more a friend than a mother but at least he has her support -- which is more than can be said for Tony whose father (Julio Oscar Mechoso) is a nearly comical stereotype of the brutalizing macho Latino patriarch. With so little to draw from their written characters Hirsch Robinson Rasuk and Michael Angarano as team mascot and hearing-impaired weakling Sid impose their own sense of youthful desire and anger to the episodic events. Nearly unrecognizable at first Ledgers Skip goes from gruff stoner boss to a pathetic shell of a man but the change isnt always convincing. Giving the pic life when it needs it most is a blond-haired Johnny Knoxville as flashy impresario Topper Burks. Grimy rough working-class beach hoods are thoroughly captured by production designer Chris Gorak and Elliot Davis ceaselessly roving camera guided by the same understanding of place and design that former production designer Hardwicke brought to ""Thirteen."" From Hendrixs ""Voodoo Child"" to Neil Youngs ""Old Man"" KCRW deejay and music supervisor Liza Richardson knocks herself out with a brilliant selection of period tunes.

"Lords of Dogtown | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lords-of-dogtown ) Lords of Dogtown (United States/Germany 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching Lords of Dogtown I momentarily became nostalgic for the summer of 1977 when I would ride my skateboard down my inclined driveway then see if I could make the sharp turn onto the sidewalk without wiping out. But nostalgia is hardly a reason to recommend a movie. A narrative re-telling of events previously chronicled in the documentary Dogtown and the Z-Boys (which was directed by the writer of this film original Z-boy Stacy Peralta) Lords of Dogtown will have limited interest for those who exist outside of the skateboarding community. The film takes us back to the 1970s in Venice California (in an area referred to as ""Dogtown"") where a bunch of beam bums turn from surfing at the rundown Pacific Ocean Pier to competition skateboarding for Zephyrs surf shop. The team which is funded by the perpetually drunk and/or stoned Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger) features three standouts brash Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) showoff Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) and introspective Stacy Peralta (John Robinson). This trio claims responsibility for re-inventing skateboarding taking it from a relatively tame ""tabletop"" sport to one that goes vertical. By using drained backyard pools (during a drought period water couldnt be spared to fill them) as practice areas the so-called Z-Boys are transformed from poor white trash to overnight sensations. Dramatically Lords of Dogtown is inert. None of the characters attains three-dimensionality and the movie skips from one episode to another so fast that its like viewing a greatest hits collection. Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) invests her film with a great deal of visual style (and employs MTV editing) but its in service of protagonists who never come alive. The real guys show more charisma in Dogtown and the Z-Boys than do the actors playing them here. Hardwicke nails the setting. This feels like the 70s not some filmmakers gauzy homage to a decade that was all things considered pretty miserable. Strangely because her re-creation of the time period is so uncanny and her style is frequently pseudo-documentary there are times when I almost thought I was watching Dogtown and the Z-Boys. This version of the story doesnt stand up well to the comparison. The documentary has both more heart and energy than the re-creation. Of the actors Emile Hirsch and Victor Rasuk convince us that they can play jerks. John Robinson shows a moody side. Heath Ledger does a great impersonation of Val Kilmer. And Johnny Knoxville plays a sleazy promoter. Nikki Reed who co-wrote and starred in Thirteen is given the thankless girlfriend/sister role. Rebecca DeMornay doesnt have much more to do playing Jays addled mother. (If makeup wasnt applied to make her look worn-down then DeMornay has not aged well. Was Risky Business that long ago?) Inept storytelling is one of Lords of Dogtowns great frustrations. Subplots are dropped. Romances start up then vanish. Betrayals occur without consequences. Theres a sense that more than half of the narrative was either left on the cutting room floor or never filmed. Whats left is less a cohesive story than a series of episodes to propel the characters from point A to point B - and the destination doesnt impress. We end up with a manipulative denouement that is supposed to make us feel something. Unfortunately since the character at the center of the melodrama is so poorly developed the most heartfelt reaction Hardwicke elicits is a shrug. And that pretty much describes my response to the film as a whole. For those with real interest in the roots of this X-sport rent the documentary and skate past this one.
