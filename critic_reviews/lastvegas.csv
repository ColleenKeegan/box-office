"New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa Courtesy of CBS Films Brad Pitt November 1 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Last Vegas directed by Jon Turteltaub Its easy to forget that nerds and teenagers arent the only moviegoers who want their fantasies indulged. I thought about that watching Morgan Freeman in Last Vegas. As Archie a twice-married Air Force retiree who recently suffered a stroke all Freeman does for his first two or three scenes is sit in an armchair watching television. Hes surrounded by bottles of pills. He looks comfortable. But when a life-long friend Billy (Michael Douglas) puts him on a three-way call with Sam (Kevin Kline) and tells them that hes getting married Archie springs into action. He gets to go to Wonderland. The plan is that theyll fetch their pal Paddy (Robert De Niro) and join Billy in Las Vegas for a bachelor weekend. Archie tells his worrywart son (Michael Ealy) hes going to a church retreat which is a nice irony. Morgan Freeman doesnt go to church. He is church. You go to him. And thats the real pleasure of watching Freeman in this amusing smart-enough comedy He finally has something fun to do. He has played so many totems of virtue cool wisdom and assistance that its almost shocking to hear him bust Douglass balls with such exasperation and goodwill. Veteran director Jon Turteltaub (While You Were Sleeping both National Treasure movies) turns in another commercial contraption here and this one hums along just as efficiently as his others. Hes a specialist in the sort of movies that are more easy than they are good -- easy to watch easy to skip. I saw Last Vegas while sitting next to a guy who seemed to grow more physically ill as the minutes passed. Its far from that bad. For one thing Dan Fogelmans script avoids a lot of what you dread with a movie like this -- that itll pull a fast one and turn Grumpy Old Men into Amour. But no one in Last Vegas dies. No one even grabs his chest in pain. Its a celebration of something the movies never celebrate anymore being old. Some of it is silly. Sam for instance is given a little blue pill and a condom by his wife (Joanna Gleason) and is instructed to rediscover the man she married. Some of the movie is weirdly complicated. Billy and Paddy wind up fighting over the same lounge singer played by an impossibly well-preserved Mary Steenburgen with a knowing ditzy slur. Paddy is mad at Billy for missing his wifes funeral and would seem to have the moral imperative with the singer over his soon-to-be-married friend. But Douglas has been given a golden tan alabaster teeth and hair Moses could part. He has the cosmetic imperative. If Freeman is church Douglas is chintz. Every once in a while the comedy ebbs and a mortal rue shows up. Douglas for instance gets a line or two about what it means to be on the far side of middle age and why old men chase younger people. (He doesnt mention surgical glamour enhancements but he doesnt have to.) It sounds like it hurts Douglas to say these words. But the cheer of this movie will make it a hit. Its silly not dumb. You want to see Morgan Freeman in a perfectly tailored scarlet suit dancing with women and drag queens. Its a spry alive side of him we rarely see and we should savor it. Who knows when hell get to Wonderland again? The Counselor directed by Ridley Scott These are boom times for geezers at the movies. The no. 1 film in the country stars Johnny Knoxville pretending to be a dirty old man and people appear to be interested in experiencing Robert Redford imperiled at sea. Meanwhile the no. 4 movie was written by an 80-year-old and directed by a man whos 75. But The Counselor has the heartless verve of filmmakers half their ages. Its filthy nasty sexy absurd appalling and exhilarating and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthys bleakness and Ridley Scotts sense of chic. It opens with sex between Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz. Hes a lawyer. Shes his girlfriend. Actually The Counselor opens with them talking about the sex shed like to have. He wants her to tell him what she wants. ""I want you to touch me"" she says bashfully ""down there."" You hear her say that and you say to yourself ""Thats all the old man has? Down there?"" Then she grows specific. Fassbender makes her wish his command. And as he went to town I tried to fasten a seat belt that wasnt there. Loosely what follows is the story of the lawyers punishment for being foolish enough to enter the drug business. Everyone calls him ""Counselor"" but he spends a lot of the film being counseled -- by an elegant Bruno Ganz an exhausted Javier Bardem a smooth Brad Pitt a raw-looking Rosie Perez and a calculating Ruben Blades. They all speak in that insinuating roughhouse poetry of McCarthys. Its a threat and a seduction at the same time. Most of these people are at one end of the drug trade or another. Perez is in prison. Bardem hides himself in nightlife development. His character Reiner provides the Counselor with a semblance of friendship. He fears the intensity of his attraction to his girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and frets about the vast unknowableness of certain women. But no one here seems trustworthy and it doesnt take long for the Southwestern dirt beneath the Counselors loafers to turn to quicksand. You knew that would happen but the movie ripples out far enough to show a brewing storm that involves strange ruthless secondary characters whose strings are pulled by unseen puppeteers. The prevailing sense of preordained hopelessness death and doom are standard McCarthy. He and Scott are not afraid of the ridiculous the symbolic the telegraphed or the literal. The movie is shockingly hilariously all of these things. I can imagine McCarthy has seen the tastefulness of The Road and the geometrical precision of No Country for Old Men and wanted something lewder and messier for his writing. This is how for example a car windshield gets a hot wax from Diaz while Bardem watches amazed in the passenger seat. That scene makes Tawny Kitaen look like Jessica Tandy. Bardems amazement was mine. The menagerie on display is remarkable. Bardem wears loud prints and big tinted bug glasses and looks as if he survived a nuclear meltdown at the Versace plant. Pitt looks like he sells used Cadillacs in 1986. And then theres Diaz. She finally gets to bring her athletic bimbo powers to bear on a part good enough to show us a welcome hardness and wisdom. The plastic surgeons havent gotten to Diaz yet. Unlike some of the older women in Last Vegas that face of hers can still tell a story. So do her clothes. All the jungle prints and snake skins she wears all the jewels and accoutrements make her exactly what certain men fear in certain women a predator. (Never mind that shes also the loving owner of two fearsome cheetahs a blatancy that would be appalling in a different film.) But you dont watch her flirt and splay herself and fear youre in the hands of misogynists. Its the opposite. The characters here might fear this woman. McCarthy and Scott kneel before her. All Is Lost directed by J.C. Chandor At 77 Robert Redford is still blonde but its an ashen sort of yellow like straw thats been drying for decades in the sun. But the creases and lines in his face havent diminished his handsomeness. Hes still something to see which is a good thing since hes all there is to watch in All Is Lost. He plays a yachtsman who awakens with a start to the sound of a small crash and the sight of water streaming through a gash in his boat. It has hit a wayward shipping container. He spends the movie trying to survive using only his nautical instincts. There are no pirates or aliens. A shark steals his lunch but the foes here are simply weather and time. This is an uncommonly absorbing movie. The director is J.C. Chandor whose previous film the stock market drama Margin Call was notable for a handful of well-wrought speeches. Aside from an apologetic letter Redfords character writes there are about two words in the film ""help"" and ""fuuuuuuuck."" Like Alfonso Cuarons Gravity and Paul Greengrasss Captain Phillips theres a kind of movie magic in play here. Chandor works with equal parts manual rigor existential wonder and circumstantial dread (the score by Alex Ebert gently sounds notes of all three). Of course it doesnt work without Redford. You need a star who doesnt seem ridiculous still slipping into cable knits and other yachtwear in a moment of crisis. You need a star who in doing and saying little gets a lot done. You need a star whose presence compensates for a screenplays narrative economy. Redford goes about the business of keeping himself alive with serious stoicism. You realize youre watching a dying breed of American masculinity. There are no tears. Theres no sentimentality. Theres no Vegas no self-pity. In rooting for this man to endure you arent hoping for the survival of a single star. Youre praying for something greater to last for an entire mode of being in the movies to persist. When Redford and Douglas and Clint Eastwood go all wont be lost. But something great and crucial to the pleasures of the movies will be. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa directed by Jeff Tremaine Theres a quiet depressing strain that runs through each of these films. Just because no one keels over in Last Vegas for instance doesnt mean you cant sense the defensiveness. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa on the other hand is a joke on the concept of death. OK its a Jackass production so its a joke on everything. But even by those standards its tenuous as a movie. Johnny Knoxville builds an hour and a half around public pranks involving his old-man character Irving Zisman. The makeup used to transform him is state-of-the-art -- as a moviegoer youre always aware youre watching a young person pretend to be old but you also believe that people on the street have no idea whats going on. All they see is a rude vaguely handsome seventyish man. Freshly widowed Irving is saddled with an estranged grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) a spiky butterball who can curse on command. They drive from Ohio to St. Louis to Tennessee and finally Raleigh where the boy is to be left with a father he doesnt know. Along the way they seemingly spontaneously concoct scenarios to ensure the shock and embarrassment of strangers. Knoxville gets a prosthetic penis stuck in a vending machine and begs for help removing it. The little boy calls random men daddy and a busty woman a tramp. Caskets are knocked over walls stained with exploded excrement and wedding cakes flown into. The problem with the film which was shot in part with hidden cameras is that Irv and Billy flee the scene before any consequences can be suffered. The movie is operating in the spirit of Sacha Baron Cohens road farces but those movies were prepared to stick around for the post-prank awkwardness because that was often where the good comedy was. Knoxville? He just wants to do Jackass stunts. And director Jeff Tremaine doesnt have any visual amazements to show us like he did in the great Jackass 3D. Bad Grandpa looks proudly cruddy. But you can feel Tremaine Knoxville and their frequent Jackass co-conspirators trying to subvert narrative comedies. Their subversion is funny only when theres tension between the old man the kid and the people who dont know theyre being fooled. The most hilarious sequence involves dressing Billy as a girl and entering him in a child beauty pageant. The wrongs pile up and theres a clear object of satire. That feels new for the Jackass experience a target that isnt a crotch. Id like to see Irv try to strike again with braver gags. Id like to see him in Vegas. Id like to see him try to write The Counselor.

"Last Vegas | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-vegas ) Last Vegas (United States 2013) November 01 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli A peek at the resumes of director Jon Turteltaub (The Sorcerers Apprentice National Treasure) and writer Dan Fogelman (Cars Fred Claus) gives an indication that Last Vegas may not be headed for edgy ground-breaking territory. Despite the presence of four capable veteran actors - Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Kevin Kline - the film never approaches comedic critical mass. The actors perform with multiple safety nets and the closest the film ever comes to taking a risk is having Freeman dance to a cover of Earth Wind amp; Fires ""September."" The movie which might have sounded good in a pitch meeting falls considerably short of ""a Hangover with four geezers."" It has the sensibilities of a late-80s/early-90s forgettable big-screen sit com and probably wont find many interested viewers who arent card-carrying AARP members. (Note to the filmmakers most AARP members watch movies at home not in theaters.) I get the feeling it might have been more fun if Turteltaub had thrown away Fogelmans predictable unfunny schlocky screenplay and opted instead to take his four actors on a vacation to Las Vegas and simply filmed what happened. To the extent that theres anything worth watching in Last Vegas its because of the sterling quartet whose members know how to deliver bad lines like theyre Shakespeare and whose charisma cant be dimmed by pedestrian camera angles. Douglas De Niro Freeman and Kline probably agreed to make this movie because they wanted to hang out with each other in Sin Citys unreal environs. Stripping away the artifice of two-dimensional characters and a lackluster storyline might have allowed audiences to appreciate them more. Last Vegas opens with a cute scene set in the mid-1950s that introduces a group of pre-teen boys who call themselves the ""Flatbush Four."" Flash forward 58 years to the present day when these kids have grown up and gotten old. They gather together in Las Vegas for the bachelor party of Billy (Douglas) whos getting hitched to a woman less than half his age. (Does she have Daddy issues? Is she a gold digger? The script doesnt know or care.) In attendance are Paddy (De Niro) whose ongoing feud with Billy leads to some uncomfortable moments; Sam (Kline) whose wife has given him a ""free pass"" while hes in Vegas with the hope it will re-energize their marriage; and Archie (Freeman) whos relishing a chance to escape from the clutches of his sons family who view him as fragile. The ""hijinks"" that ensue arent just tame by Hangover standards theyre tame by Vegas Vacation standards. No tigers no Elvis impersonators and (most importantly) no Mike Tyson. Last Vegas goes exactly where youd expect it to go with the narrative progressing with the familiarity of a connect-the-dots approach. There are no surprises (big or small) and the uneven comedy is more likely to provoke occasional chuckles that good old fashioned belly-laughs. Even worse nearly every slightly amusing moment is available in the trailer thereby diminishing (if not nullifying) Last Vegas already feeble humor quotient. While none of the actors is going to pick up an Oscar nomination for Last Vegas theres still a degree of entertainment available from watching their interaction. Someone once said they could happily pass an hour listening to Morgan Freeman read from a phone book and while there may be some truth in that one could argue names and numbers is more compelling than the dialogue Archie is encumbered with. Mary Steenbugen meanwhile is saddled with the unfortunate task of playing the love interest caught between De Niros widower and Douglas womanizer. The saddest thing about having a cast of this caliber is that by giving them material on this level an opportunity has been wasted. This is direct-to-video material. Its fast food being served by waiters in tuxes and tails.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 01 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Nov. 01 2013 759AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jon Turteltaub Written by Dan Fogelman Starring Robert De Niro Michael Douglas Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline Classification PG Country USA Language English The geezers-gone-wild comedy Last Vegas starring Robert De Niro (70) Michael Douglas (69) Morgan Freeman (76) and Kevin Kline (66) plays like a blend of The Hangover and Grumpy Old Men. You could add The Bucket List too since this film gave these Oscar-winning veterans their first-ever opportunity to work together on screen. Actor Morgan Freeman poses for a photo during an interview with The Canadian Press in Oakville Ont. on Thursday November 12 2009. Freeman says he agreed to participate in a Canadian-made documentary about his Mississippi hometown because he felt that children there were being ""warped"" by racism. Video Video R.I.P. Morgan Freeman - dont worry its just a really cool art exhibit Directed by Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) and written by Dan Fogelman (The Guilt Trip Crazy Stupid Love) the movie is a preholiday trifle thats mildly risque and a lot sentimental.The stars play childhood friends who dubbed themselves ""The Flatbush Four"" and they reunite in their senior years for a Vegas bachelor party.The host is Malibu playboy lawyer Billy (Douglas) who has impulsively proposed to his 31-year-old girlfriend while delivering a friends eulogy.The gang includes Archie (Freeman) in New Jersey who has suffered a mild stroke and has been chafing ever since under the cautious watch of his son (Michael Ealy). In Florida Sam (Kline) is fading away in a purgatorial retirement community; as hes leaving for Vegas his wife (Joanna Gleason) hands him an envelope with a Viagra pill and a condom in the hope a fling will revive their sex lives.Lastly theres the surly Paddy (De Niro) who lives alone in his New York apartment and is the hardest to persuade to take the trip He still bears a grudge against Billy who missed Paddys wifes funeral a year before.Shortly after they arrive in Las Vegas Archie wins big at black jack and hoping to win some of its money back the casino comps them a gymnasium-sized penthouse suite. Early on they meet the warmly engaging Diana (Mary Steenburgen in the best performance here except for her distracting Cleopatra wig).A former Atlanta lawyer trying to make a fresh start as lounge singer Diana is amused by the four aging adolescents.She takes them under her wing and soon rekindles an old rivalry between Paddy and Billy.Theres a big party naturally with babes booze and misbehaviour and it results in the expected reversals of the mens defeatist perspectives Sam shows his moves on the dance floor; Paddy channels his rage by decking a young punk Sam expands his erotic horizons; and Billy rediscovers true romance.The cast members are all capable and game but there are only so many times you can watch old crepe-necked dudes dreamily ogling young females before you start to feel queasy. Clearly what happens in Vegas really needs to stay there.

What happens in Last Vegas naps in Vegas review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWhat happens in Last Vegas naps in Vegas reviewWhat happens in Las Vegas stays in Vegas ... mainly because the elderly revellers cant remember what they did.From left Kevin Kline Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas in Last Vegas a lukewarm Hangover-esque comedyBy Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 1 2013Last VegasStarring Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Michael Douglas Kevin Kline and Mary Steenburgen. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. Opens Nov. 1 at GTA theatres. 110 minutes. PGWhat happens in Last Vegas stays in Vegas ... mainly because the elderly revellers cant remember what they did.Ba-da-bump-bump. Yes the jokes in the movie are all about as bad as this one and so is the obligatory observation that this is The Hangover for greybeards.Article Continued BelowIts not that Robert De Niro Michael Douglas Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline are exactly phoning it in -- although if they were it would be with a rotary dial telephone.But theyre just not trying that hard. While it probably looked great on the back of a producers cocktail napkin to put these four names together (that same napkin could likely hold Dan Fogelmans script) the execution is somewhat lacking.After a brief prologue set in 1950s Brooklyn showing us four live wires known as the Flatbush Four director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) whisks us to the dead-socket dotage of their 60s and 70s.Douglass Billy is the only member of the gang on an upswing hes getting married to a woman half his age. As for the others De Niros Paddy is mourning his dead wife (and nursing a grudge against Billy); Freemans Archie is under virtual house arrest with a heart condition; and Klines Sam is wondering what happened to his life and libido.The solution for both wedding and woes? A Vegas road trip for the boys wherein they can toast the groom and get up to mischief in-between naps.After the usual roundup antics with Paddy initially balking the lads find themselves in Vegas surrounded by slot machines showgirls and the ghosts of cliches from comedies past.Gags about blowing the pension dough mistaking a him for a her and pretending to be gangsters with a penthouse suite roll out like a load of Boost bottles tumbling off a grocery shelf.De Niro and Douglas weirdly play versions of their real selves while Freeman and Kline ham it up as if theyre auditioning for a reality show called Gramps Gone Wild. Theyre pros enough to goose the show along and there is the occasional chuckle. Theyre all upstaged though by Mary Steenburgen who as a tax-attorney-turned-lounge-singer adds some needed zest estrogen and romantic attraction. Shes the Shirley MacLaine to these Rat Pack retirees.De Niro Douglas Freeman Kline and Steenburgen make a total of five Oscar winners in Last Vegas. With talent like this youd have reason to expect a comedy with more spring in its step.This one cant bend far enough to tie its loafers.

""Last Vegas"" waits about 10 minutes - and only because it has to get a prostate joke in first. Im not sure that qualifies as restraint. Still it has a pretty amazing cast -- Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline as four aging Flatbush friends plus Mary Steenburgen popping up as the gal who comes between two of them in Las Vegas. Thats an awful lot of Oscars on one screen and the potential for a lot of good scenes. True the script by the fantastically inconsistent Dan Fogelman -- who wrote the very good ""Twisted"" and ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and the awful ""Cars 2"" and ""The Guilt Trip"") -- doesnt come up with much for the actors to actually play. But thats why you hire old pros. So Douglas a phenomenally good sport gently pokes fun at his aging lothario image (the gimmick of the film is that hes about to get married to a woman nearly 40 years his junior and he needs a bachelor party). Freeman busts a move to some tasty Earth Wind and Fire and utility players Kline and De Niro pick up the slack. Even though the film mocks the dirty-old-man tastes of Douglas character it indulges in some ageism itself; the two men Steenburgen is supposed to be torn between are both about a decade older than she is. Of course in Hollywood that doesnt raise an eyebrow. Perhaps because the Botoxed beauties there cant raise an eyebrow. Although theres not much here behind a few broad strokes -- playboy Douglas grumpy widower De Niro randy Kline and Freeman as an overprotected senior eager to take some risks -- the actors are happy to work within them. Kline who is an old hand at comedy is particularly delightful (even if his character -- so eager to cheat on his wife now that shes bizarrely given him her blessing - is the least sympathetic). Freeman is surprisingly funny too particularly in a drunk scene. But the movie has a rather limited view of women at best -- if theyre over 40 theyre obliging saints and if theyre young theyre over-40DDs. And even for a modern Hollywood movie the product placement -- and boy its amazing how much high rollers love their Bud Light -- is absurdly ever-present. Director Jon Turteltaub who has trudged his way through two ""National Treasure"" movies and many more you dont remember keeps things in focus and hits all the obligatory tourist spots. Of course what he doesnt do is give the film any kind of comic verve. Which -- lets face it -- a story about four Rat-Pack-kinda guys coming to terms with the new Vegas really should have had. When it was first announced wags made the inevitable ""Its The Hangover -- with walkers"" jokes. If only. Still it does have these four men. And even if that may not justify a trip to the theater it will make it a painless rent in a few months. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language brief violence substance abuse and lots of dental-floss bikinis. Last Vegas (PG-13) CBS Films (103 min.) Directed by Jon Turteltaub. With Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Kevin Kline.

Photo Chuck Zlotnick MOVIE REVIEW Last Vegas Running time 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexuality profanity). At the E-Walk the 34th Street the East 86th Street others. The best you can say about ""Last Vegas is that this geriatric variation on ""The Hangover with Robert De Niro Michael Douglas Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline isnt as awful as it could have been. Sure anyone with an aversion to hokey jokes about hemorrhoids incontinence funerals hip replacements hearing and sight loss Viagra and erectile dysfunction might reasonably take a pass. And Oscar winners De Niro Douglas and Freeman coasting on their well-worn screen personas in this formulaic and superpredictable comedy is not exactly a recipe for fresh entertainment. But the film at least achieves the level of mediocrity thanks to the professionalism of two slightly younger participants -- Kline and Mary Steenburgen who also have Oscars on their mantels but go well beyond phoning it in here. The reunion of the four alter kockers from Flatbush is set into motion when Malibu attorney Douglas finally decides to get married for the first time proposing to his much younger girlfriend in the middle of delivering a eulogy. The most reluctant participant in the Vegas bachelor party is De Niro a grumpy widower whos angry with Douglas for not attending his wifes funeral. Freeman whos been held under virtual home arrest at his sons house in New Jersey since suffering a minor stroke is eager to booze it up and gamble. So is senior citizen Kline whose wife gives him a hall pass to cheat when she drops him off at the airport in Miami. An inventive comic actor Kline manages to put a spin on even the creakiest gags in the schmaltzy script by Dan Fogelman (""The Guilt Trip) -- as when removing his glasses Kline makes a pass at a lady who turns out to be a middle-aged transsexual Madonna impersonator (Roger Bart). Steenburgen also exudes some much-needed charm as a lounge singer who attracts the attention of both the engaged Douglas and the widowed De Niro -- who wouldnt you know were romantic rivals for De Niros late wife half a century or so ago. When in doubt throw in a montage Vegas stock footage or a cameo appearance by 50 Cent -- that seems to be the chief strategy of director Jon Turteltaub whose rap sheet includes ""The Sorcerers Apprentice and the two ""National Treasure films. Thanks in no small part to Kline and Steenburgen ""Last Vegas has its moments. When theyre not on-screen beware of half-baked ham and hypoglycemic shock.

Starring Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Kevin Kline Morgan Freeman and Mary Steenburgen. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) From a distance ""Last Vegas"" looked like something not worth seeing sentimental not very funny glossing over the real issues surrounding the shift into old age ... but no. ""Last Vegas"" is an entertaining movie with a lot of integrity and it gives all of its actors - all heavyweights and Oscar winners - real moments to dig in and play something. Its the story of four childhood friends whove fanned out to different parts of the country but remain in touch. All are facing 70 and are reacting in different ways. Billy (Michael Douglas) who has become wealthy is about to end his long bachelorhood by marrying a 30-year-old woman. Paddy (De Niro) is recovering from the death of his wife and can barely get out of his bathrobe. Archie (Morgan Freeman) having had a mild stroke has to overcome his fear and resume life. And Sam (Kevin Kline) has lost his zest and cant shake a mild depression. The friends reunite in Vegas for Billys bachelor party and the story takes place over the course of a couple of days. Paddy has a grievance against Billy Though theyre supposed to be best friends Billy didnt come to Paddys wifes funeral. As is typical of the movies honest willingness to present unpleasant emotions in a comedy there is nothing funny about Paddys anger. He is as nasty as Robert De Niro can be. Meanwhile Sam is walking around with a condom and a little blue pill burning a hole in his pocket - gifts from his wife (Joanna Gleason) under the old clause in the marriage contract that says what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Anything to bring him back to life. As Sam Kline brings up the laugh quotient in a subplot that lands perfectly. Mary Steenburgen plays a former professional woman pursuing her dream as a singer and she becomes the romantic interest of two of the men. That a 60-year-old actress can be cast in a romantic role is a welcome sign in a Hollywood movie - usually they cast a 45-year-old and take it for granted that a woman should be interested in men old enough to be her father. But its even better that Steenburgen is so convincing in the role as in feminine and desirable and totally believable as someone men would be fighting over. Movies like this usually have subtitles. The comedy remains a presence throughout but ""Last Vegas"" has a serious purpose and the resolution of the mens journey of realization is anything but corny. Maybe there are just too many viewers out there thinking about these things people either Baby Boomer age or older and so movies cant lie anymore. In any case the climactic scene as played by Douglas is as heartfelt as anything he has ever done. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 603 p.m. EDT October 31 2013Despite a raft of Oscars among them the amiable stars of Last Vegas cant save the story from cliches and cookie-cutter humor.Last Vegas has plenty of acting firepower but little spark.(Photo Chuck Zlotnick)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Michael Douglas Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro Kevin Kline Mary SteenburgenRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes; opens nationwide FridayActors are fond of saying that film is a directors medium. In Last Vegas ( out of four rated PG-13 opens nationwide Friday) they may have proven their point.Its hard to imagine that this much acting firepower could produce anything less than a solid fall film if not a good one.Alas this all-star ensemble comedy that trumpets (too loudly) that its a Hangover on hemorrhoid cream musters enough laughs to be passable if not memorable. And thats thanks to Morgan Freemans showmanship.Three codgers in their late 60s decide to throw a bachelor party for their marital holdout who is going to marry a lass less than half his age. Vegas setup is about as brusque and cookie-cutter as Hollywood gets and director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) seems headed for comedy cliche hell.INTERVIEW Last Vegas stars share secrets of drinking agingSTORY What happened on the set of Last VegasMORE Is Vegas really the new hip movieREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersBut Freemans cantankerous Archie bantering with buddies Paddy (Robert De Niro) and Sam (Kevin Kline) peppers the film with solid laughs through the films first half.Where Hangover began with our Wolf Pack waking up in a posh casino hotel Vegas takes a good 45 minutes to get there.And theyre the films best scenes particularly as the men make excuses to doting-but-dull spouses overprotective kids and the ghosts of wives past that they could use one last trip to Sin City. Each escape is a touching breakout.Once they reach Vegas though the movie putters into predictability and loses its footing like a tipsy pole dancer.There can be no blaming the five primary players here all of whom are Oscar winners. While De Niro has the most thankless role as a nagging widower who still keeps photos of his wife plastered around the house the stars bring beautiful subtlety as young turks struggling with becoming old guard.Freeman gets the most laughs as an apt gambler who has been waiting years for a good table and a stiff drink. Kline has looked like a convincing father figure since The Big Chill.But the most surprising performances belong to groom-to-be Billy (Michael Douglas) and past-her-prime lounge crooner Diana (Mary Steenburgen). At 69 Douglas still looks utterly convincing as a senior who could lure a 31-year-old. And at 60 Steenburgen remains stunning and utterly believable as a torch singer who can still light flames.But theyre no match for the pat script which telegraphs its second half exactly when the men first discover Diana singing. From the moment she quips that they look ready for a nap to the final credits Vegas beats its punchline -- look at wrinkled guys partying -- so vigorously that by movies end you may be ready for that nap.The story cant completely undermine the performances which flicker with chemistry. These legends clearly enjoy each others company. But considering their legacies Vegas should have been a sure bet. 17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bHaw39Holiday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Kevin Kline from left Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas are childhood pals who reunite for a wild vacation in ""Last Vegas."" (Chuck Zlotnick) By Stephanie Merry October 31 2013 Follow stephmerry Some movies are hard to approach without preconceived notions. Take ""Last Vegas"" for example. The ubiquitous preview features Kevin Kline Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas partying in Sin City which makes the movie look like a weary retread of ""The Hangover"" except with Lipitor jokes. (Whats next Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn starring in a baby boomer version of ""Bridesmaids""?) But whoever is in charge of trailers for this comedy might want to try a different career path. ""Last Vegas"" may not deliver potent originality but its much funnier than that first one-minute glimpse implies. The actors play the self-designated Flatbush Four a quartet of kids who grew up in Brooklyn and stayed in touch over six decades even as their fates diverged. Sam (Kline) lives with his wife and new knee in Florida amid moribund neighbors; Archie (Freeman) having recently suffered a stroke resides under the careful supervision of his patronizing son; widower Paddy (De Niro) remains rooted to an easy chair wearing a bathrobe and surrounded by a phalanx of photos of his late wife. And then theres Billy (Douglas). With his taut orange face he looks the part of a man with beachfront property in Malibu and a 31-year-old fiancee. His impending marriage is the impetus for the wild vacation. Director Jon Turteltaub knows his way around a crowd-pleaser (he did ""Cool Runnings"" and ""National Treasure"") and Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love"") contributes a decent script. But its the actors plus an exuberant Mary Steenburgen as quick-witted lounge singer Diana who make the movie more than a middling copycat. Kline Freeman De Niro and Douglas demonstrate both the easy chemistry and excitable energy of old friends reconvening after years apart and they all genuinely seem to be having fun. Kline is especially memorable and his comedic abilities have hardly diminished in the years since ""A Fish Called Wanda."" When he cant figure out to how to pop the trunk or unlock the doors of his rental car he turns what could have been a trite joke into big laughs. Not everything works so seamlessly. Billys proposal to his fiancee -- during a eulogy -- is a scene that practically begs for an eye roll. At that moment the prophecy of the movies trailer feels all too real. But when Sam and Archie hear about the proposal and give the same incredulous head shake that audience members did moments earlier the gesture somehow makes the bizarre spectacle more palatable. The filmmakers seem to acknowledge their own ridiculousness. Nevertheless seeing 60- and 70-somethings ogle 20-year-old women and judge a bikini contest is a little hard to take. But this is broad comedy after all. The movie aims to do little more than serve up laughter. Even the sentimental moments are couched with punch lines. All in all ""Last Vegas"" is a brisk and goofy adventure that manages to mine fanny packs and big white tennies for more laughter than it should. Maybe baby boomer bridesmaids wouldnt be so bad.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sexual content and language. 104 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Special to Newsday + - From left Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline in a scene from ""Last Vegas."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Four old birds from Flatbush reflock in the city of forced fun. Rated PG-13 (sexual content and language) BOTTOM LINE Alternately trashy and teary marginally funny occasionally cringe-inducing. CAST Robert De Niro Kevin Kline Morgan Freeman Michael Douglas Mary Steenburgen. LENGTH 145 With a cast of likable old pros and the oleaginous Michael Douglas ""Last Vegas"" seems a pretty depressing title for a film that tries so hard to be jovial. Whats more depressing is what the movie portends More and more ""mature"" stars traveling in packs more boomer comedies making randy fun of getting old more maudlin resolutions of meaningless conflicts. In a word more Considering some of our favorite titles of the past few years (""Final Destination 5"" ""The Last Exorcism Part II"") we cant even find comfort in the thought that this ""Vegas"" might be the last. At best its ""Next to Last Vegas."" Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Kevin Kline and Douglas star as boyhood friends entering their dotage (if you wonder why Kline seems so much younger its because at 66 he is; Freeman is 76). And as directed by Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure"") the movie certainly plucks the old heart strings -- or mauls them depending on your degree of resistance. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Paddy (De Niro) Billy (Douglas) Archie (Freeman) and Sam (Kline) grew up in Flatbush Billy and Paddy falling in love with the same girl Paddy marrying her and Billy missing her funeral which Paddy cant forgive. When Sam and Archie decide that Billys impending marriage -- to a woman less than half his age of course -- demands a bachelor party in Vegas they have to trick Paddy into going. But he does bringing his grudge along which provides endless opportunity for emotions and catharsis. If the viewer can get by that the film is a big fat silicon-enhanced ad for Las Vegas he or she will find a fine comedic performance by Kline whose Sam has been given permission by his wife (Joanna Gleason) to have a fling and is so gleefully willing to exercise the option it almost becomes its own movie. Freeman is warm and appealing; De Niro curmudgeonly and Mary Steenburgen as a lounge singer who rekindles the rivalry between Paddy and Billy is a breath of fresh air -- which in this overheated ""Vegas"" is welcome indeed.

SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Last Vegas"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 31 2013 1135 AM ""Raging Bull."" ""The Shawshank Redemption."" ""Wall Street."" ""A Fish Called Wanda."" Thats the kind of thing that comes to mind when you think of Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Michael Douglas and Kevin Kline. Oscar winners all. So what comes to mind after you see them all together for ""Last Vegas"" an aging-buddy comedy? Things like ""oops"" and ""ugh"" and ""dang."" Because Jon Turteltaubs film is a misfire from start to finish a waste of a prodigious amount of talent. Sure the actors seem to enjoy each others company but that was true in Adam Sandlers wretched ""Grown Ups."" It doesnt mean it was any fun for the rest of us. (Then again that movie was so popular it merited a sequel. No accounting for tastes.) ""Last Vegas"" starts with the four aging men as boys romping around in New York friends for life. Or so they thought. Then we move to the present where Billy (Douglas) calls Archie (Freeman) and Sam (Kline) to break the news Heretofore a confirmed bachelor hes getting married and to a much younger woman. They have to come to Las Vegas explains Billy a rich wheeler-dealer of some sort. They agree. But what of Paddy (De Niro) who lost his wife a year ago? Thats trickier. He and Billy had a falling out. And although Billy wants him at the bachelor party and wedding he knows the angry Paddy wont come. So they trick him. Eventually the four get together. They befriend lounge singer Diana (Mary Steenburgen). They make jokes about being old; they make jokes about being infirm; and they inevitably make Viagra jokes especially Sam whose wife has given him a free pass to have a fling if he wants. Its all predictable and despite the best efforts of Turteltaub and screenwriter Dan Fogelman at something a little risky its pretty lame. Its also a little sad. You keep waiting for some of the magic all four men have shown in the past but instead oh look lets have the old guys judge a bikini contest thatll be funny. Or not. These are among the great actors of their generation. Of many generations. The thought of them playing their age or close to it facing the challenges getting older bring has fascinating potential. Trusted with a smart script who knows how exciting the results could be? But saddled with a lackluster script? We have our answer. And its not pretty. If they want to hang out with each other in Vegas resorts and cash in with a big payday more power to them. Enjoy yourselves guys. Just dont ask us to tag along.

Not necessarily a bad place to be except the film unfortunately has the madcap hilarity of the former and the emotional intensity of the latter. Throw in the geriatric jokes and smarmy sentimentality of ""The Bucket List"" (2007) and the result is a joyless buddy movie from genial hack Jon Turtletaub.

Chuck Zlotnick This image released by CBS Films shows from left Kevin Kline Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas in a scene from ""Last Vegas."" (AP Photo/CBS Films Chuck Zlotnick) Chuck Zlotnick This image released by CBS Films shows from left Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline in a scene from ""Last Vegas."" (AP Photo/CBS Films Chuck Zlotnick) Have you heard about this new movie in which the embodiment of the older generation travels across the country to prank youngsters? Well this is the other one. The bad grandpas in ""Last Vegas"" are not likely to cash a check the size of Johnny Knoxvilles but they might leave a stronger smell behind them. Injecting a dose of dumbed-down nostalgia into a certain smash comedy about four dudes on the loose in Sin City this arthritic exercise should be called ""The Combover.""As with the dead-on-arrival caper comedy ""Stand Up Guys"" its easy to imagine some twenty-something studio interns wondering how many legendary actors could dance on the head of a pin-headed idea. Were guessing that Clint Eastwood told the kids to get off his lawn before the script was tossed to these takers.Michael Douglas is Malibu attorney Billy the last bachelor from a Brooklyn crew that also includes happily married Florida retiree Sam (Kevin Kline) stroke-slowed New Jersey churchgoer Archie (Morgan Freeman) and New York widower Paddy (Robert De Niro). As we learn in a flashback prelude Paddy and Billy had loved the same woman when they were little rascals in Brooklyn and she eventually chose Paddy. Shes now deceased but Paddys grievances are alive and kicking as he lands in Las Vegas for his former friend Billys bachelor party.Thats a sourpuss start to a wild weekend but director Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure"") has plenty of counterfeit plot points up his tattered sleeve. Archie parlays his retirement savings into a windfall at the roulette table and an upgrade at the swanky casino (whose name we wont bother to mention because it hasnt paid us for the privilege like it clearly paid the producers). An expensive night at a deafening ultra-lounge reaps the gang a goomba sidekick (Jerry Ferrara) who thinks the fellas are East Coast mobsters and it inevitably leads to a free-for-all party in the penthouse. With fliers distributed throughout the Strip the attendees include faceless bikini babes a notorious real-life rapper and a seductive showgirl who turns out to be -- gasp -- a dude (Roger Bart). But dont worry Mom and Dad there are also some simulated feelings as when Billy is briefly distracted by a lawyer-turned-lounge singer (Mary Steenburgen) who is more age-appropriate than his bubbly bride-to-be (who is barely mentioned in the witless script by Dan Fogelman).In trying to lift this lame schtick De Niro Douglas Freeman and Kline are stand-up guys but ""Last Vegas"" is a case of erectile dysfunction.What ""Last Vegas""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 145  Content Sexual content and language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Last Vegas movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Last Vegas finds Oscar winners taking a trip to Sin City  1/2Four great actors have some fun with a familiar premiseOctober 31 2013|Michael PhillipsKevin Kline (as Sam Harris) Morgan Freeman (as Archie Clayton) Robert De Niro (as Paddy Connors) and Michael Douglas (as Billy Gherson) star in ""Last Vegas."" (Chuck Zlotnick/CBS Films )A genial ""Hangover"" for the AARP set ""Last Vegas"" is roughly what youd expect or fear but a little better.The four stars born between 1937 and 1947 are Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline. The setup Lifelong Flatbush-born pals reunite for the bachelor party of the Douglas character a Malibu slicko marrying a much younger woman. Old grudges reignite; new high jinks (biking contest judging fistfights with twerps one-third their age) ensue; a tax attorney turned Vegas lounge singer played by Mary Steenburgen excites the interest of the Douglas character as well as the grieving widower portrayed by De Niro.Why do we go to movies like ""Last Vegas""? For the thrill of new forms being discovered before our eyes? For the shock of the new? For a dozen good laughs? No. We go because we know what it will be like in advance. We know and like the people on the screen. We hope itll be a little better than we expect or fear. And if we settle for half-a-dozen good laughs well come out reasonably entertained.The screenwriter is Dan Fogelman who wrote ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (the film with the most annoying period in the history of titles) and ""The Guilt Trip."" Directed by Jon Turteltaub the movie serves Red Bull amp; vodkas to its tentative swingers which leads to a pretty funny joke delivered by Freeman ""I feel like Im getting drunk and electrocuted at the same time."" Fogelman deserves credit for writing a reasonably dimensional female lead the wisecracking Steenburgen part whose interactions with these guys you may not believe for an instant. But belief isnt the point of a commodity such as ""Last Vegas."" Neither is suspension of disbelief. The point is seeing what a first-rate ensemble can do with second-rate material broad one minute pathos-ridden the next.Well close with Kline. He isnt fooling anyone playing a cranky dried-out Florida retiree. Kline has such natural dash and brio as a performer its a bit of a joke watching him try to quash it and rechannel it as cuddly adorability. And yet its entertaining him trying to turn himself into Eli Wallach while ""Last Vegas"" pulls demurely raunchy variations on the theme of Prostate Trouble meets Sin City.mjphillipstribune.com""Last Vegas"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content and language)Running time 144Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesGood Universe sells Oldboy Last Vegas UPI lands key...May 22 2012Guilt Trip with a funny lady -- and son December 18 2012Disney Planning Movie Based on Its a Small WorldApril 22 2014Dan Pompeis Bears mailbagSeptember 9 2010Was This Trip Necessary?July 22 1994Find More Stories AboutSin CityKevin KlineTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-last-vegas-1101-20131031,0,6021188.column",200,lastvegas21,lastvegas,chicagotribune

Its a dumbfounding irony that the fiction of the ""entitled selfish millennial"" was invented by Baby Boomers. The generation that created Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon grew up to be weirdly deaf to irony and probably wont even get what a damning metaphor Last Vegas accidentally turns out to be. More on that below. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A new iteration of the dude-bro Dionysian comedy the film is a reverse Mentos commercial in which the clever old people have to outwit the entitled selfish young people in order to get into the nightclub or yank a casinos penthouse suite away from a formerly respectable hip-hop artist now slumming in lazy mid-budget comedies. Presumably the casts enthusiasm to work together was greater than their enthusiasm for the script a sitcom-level tissue of broad jokes flat gags and lazy coincidences. But what the film has in spades is charm its four co-stars leveraging obvious mutual admiration and roughly 160 man-years of comic experience for some genuine onscreen chemistry. Anyone would want to hang out with these guys.Film Details Last Vegas RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time90 More Info Its a get-the-band-back-together plot featuring a cast that never actually teamed up in their prime. When 70-year-old bachelor Billy (Michael Douglas) proposes to his much-younger girlfriend -- at a funeral while delivering the eulogy -- his three childhood friends insist on throwing him the same Las Vegas bachelor party hed thrown in their honor decades before. Sam (Kevin Kline) who hasnt boned his wife in a decade gets her tacit permission to cheat during the long weekend. Paddy (Robert De Niro) is in extended mourning for his deceased wife. And Archie (Morgan Freeman who is the greatest) a twice-divorced stroke survivor in fear of recurrence has consigned himself to a hermetic life in his overprotective sons home. The films hidden asset is the luminous Mary Steenburgen funny and gorgeous as an empty-nest mom turned lounge chanteuse who beguiles the dudes with age-appropriate flirting and arch humor.The stair-lift of a script safely transports the men past an array of inconsequential obstacles scattered by screenwriter Dan Fogelman in lieu of oh basic goddamn storytelling. The characters are totally passive -- money drinks women and unexpected acclaim shower down on these elder-bros like Werthers Originals from Gods own cardigan pocket completely unearned by the characters or the screenplay. Its an uncomfortable accidental metaphor for the whole Baby Boom generation squirted frictionless through life into Modern Maturity with a wealth of hair-replacement techniques and the last pensions ever offered by the economy they stripped for parts everything easy-peasy-prostate-squeezy.But look Last Vegas cuddly and forgettable doesnt have a mean bone in its body. Of course Sam declines to cheat on his wife with a beautiful unhappy millennial. And of course Billy reconsiders marrying his age-inappropriate fiancee. Irony-deaf members of the Big Chill cohort despite dismantling the social safety net inventing credit-default swaps and unpaid internships and consigning even their own college-educated children to service-sector survival still prefer to think of themselves as way too responsible ever to fuck younger generations.Follow VoiceFilmClubSubscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Chris Packham Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The high point of Last Vegas is also arguably the low point of Robert De Niros career. Early in the film Paddy (De Niro) and his retirement-age buddies--Archie (Morgan Freeman) Billy (Michael Douglas) and Sam (Kevin Kline)--bribe their way into judging a poolside bikini contest that is being emceed by LMFAO member RedFoo. As ""Party Rock Anthem"" blares in the background RedFoo rips off his pants and leaps onto Paddys deck chair rhythmically thrusting his Speedod crotch into the older mans face. De Niro the lion of American acting reacts with the bemused half-grimace half-smile of a man whose infant grandson just peed in his lap. Last Vegas spends much of its running time skirting bad taste but this is the only moment when it goes all-out. Though director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure The Sorcerers Apprentice) has a knack for making diverting effects-driven camp he sputters here. Reality-bending silliness--or even a good gross-out joke or two--would be preferable to the stale corny jokes this movie tries to pass off as comedy. Sam takes off his glasses and accidentally tries to pick up a drag performer at a bar. Archie busts some disco moves on the dance floor which is supposed to be funny because Freeman is an old person. A young casino guest is tricked into believing the four friends are East Coast mobsters which is supposed to be funny because De Niro is in the movie. There is a cameo from 50 Cent which qualifies as a joke because the concept of 50 Cent is inherently funny. Gaps between ""jokes"" are filled with schmaltz. Paddy Sam and Archie have come to Las Vegas to celebrate Billys marriage to a woman roughly half his age. Each character is portioned out a subplot and a lesson Archie has recently suffered a mild stroke and is keeping the trip a secret from his overprotective son; Sams wife has given him permission to cheat on her while hes in Vegas; Paddy is angry at Billy for not attending his wifes funeral; Billy starts falling for a lounge singer his own age (Mary Steenburgen) and having doubts about his impending marriage. Steenburgen is appropriately alluring in the role and wasting her performance on a second-rate love triangle in a third-rate geezer comedy is downright criminal.

Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline are each playing men who are stuck in a rut and need to be prodded back to life. Thus the outline of the movie is basically City Slickers meets Grumpy Old Men meets (ironically enough) a teens-losing-their-virginity farce since most of these characters have been away from sex and romance for so long that they might as well be starting over. When you go to a movie like Last Vegas you know that youre seeing a comedy-as-market-tested-package yet on that level this one is reasonably competent -- it rarely goes over-the-top or insults your intelligence. And since Douglas De Niro Freeman and Kline display the soft-shoe touch of old pros who know how to let loose and enjoy themeslves playing these stodgy insult-tossing cranks the actors put just a little bit of flesh on the movies high-concept bones. The characters have been devoted pals ever since they were growing up in Brooklyn in the 50s when they dubbed themselves the Flatbush Four. But life has now dimmed their dreams. Billy (Douglas) the wealthy meticulously preserved hollow-man overachiever of the group is the one getting married -- to a woman (Bre Blair) he may not really love and who happens to be nearly 40 years younger than he is. If that sounds creepy fear not The film makes every cradle-robbing joke it can at his expense so the audience doesnt have to. (It also ribs Michael Douglas for his ""hazelnut"" hair and spray-on tan though I would add that the tan doesnt look remotely tan Its closer to spray-on Tropicana.) Out to have a good time Billy asks his old friends to join him in Sin City for a weekend party -- an offer that takes some cajoling since most of the pals feel like theyve already checked out. Paddy (De Niro) is a scowling cynic mired in depression ever since his wife died a year ago. Archie (Morgan Freeman) who suffered a minor stroke views himself as an ailing wreck no longer allowed to do the things -- like drinking and dancing -- that once gave him joy. Sam (Kevin Kline) a nebbish with a white thatch of hair and beard (think Hemingway as tax accountant) enjoys the comfort and security of a 40-year marriage but feels almost literally bored to death a situation so transparent that right before he leaves his wife (Joanna Gleason) gifts him with a Viagra pill and a condom so he can sleep with somebody else. Hello Vegas I steeled myself for the moment when these four would fall into what-happens-in-Vegas ""high jinks"" but fortunately they dont. The movie never enters that Hangover unreality zone. Instead it has mild fun with how out of touch they are (good laugh Archie tries to get into a hip club by tipping the doorman a whopping 10). Along the way they befriend Diana (Mary Steenburgen) a lonely nightclub singer who becomes the focal point of a romantic rivalry between Paddy and -- yes -- Billy (it says something about Douglas that he can play a groom-to-be falling for someone else?and still get you to find him a likable crocodile). After a while you truly start to see the formula gears churning but given that it helps to have an actress like Mary Steenburgen who at 60 still possesses an amazing glow as well as a snappier comic timing than ever. Thrown into the highly controlled pleasure dome of Vegas our old boys win at blackjack become judges at a poolside bikini contest and at one point pass themselves off as Mob kingpins. They also remember what its like to have fun without a shred of respectability a sensation that Last Vegas captures all too well. B?

Review Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas Hash Out Their Differences In Generally Amusing Romp Last Vegas But Whats the Point? Eric Kohn Oct 28 2013 221 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk For viewers with sophisticated taste ""Last Vegas"" may invite derision for its premise alone Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline as old buddies reunited in their senior years for a wild Las Vegas trip to celebrate one of their groups recent engagement? Feh. Yet the truth is that you wont see another movie this year with a more obvious reason for its existence Distributor CBS Films has coyly positioned the comedy as a tamer ""Hangover"" for the over-sixty set an ideal form of counter-programming for older theatergoers in the heat of a season riddled with serious-minded awards season fare. Its a slick product not unlike others from the commercially-oriented oeuvre of director Jon Turteltaub whose other credits include the ""National Treasure"" franchise. In this case the spectacle is the cast itself -- legends of the trade possibly past their prime but like their characters eager to enjoy the ride. Like Turteltaub many of screenwriter Dan Fogelmans credits also invite the perception of a commitment to Hollywood formula (""The Guilt Trip"" ""Fred Claus"") though its his experience writing animation (""Bolt"" both ""Cars"" movies) that seems relevant here. By no means a great movie ""Last Vegas"" churns along with a blatantly silly unadventurous plot that owes much to the charisma of its performers running free with absurd vignettes. The essence of the movies appeal comes down to one throwaway scene Morgan Freeman as the genial seizure-prone Archie tries Red Bull for the first time at a Vegas bar and loses it (""its like getting drunk and electrocuted at the same time"") leading to an innately hilarious moment thats also an unapologetic form of product placement. In a larger sense ""Last Vegas"" is an ephemeral commercial product thats eager to please. Fogels script methodically establishes its ensemble one step at a time Slick ladies man Billy (Douglas) pops the question to youthful girlfriend while delivering the eulogy for an old friend; Sam (Kline) has grown weary of his retired unadventurous married life; Archie copes with his overly protective doting son; and straightfaced widower Paddy (De Niro) leads a solitary life. When Sam and Archie pop into Paddys home and insist he join them on a trip to celebrate Billys engagement Paddys attempts to send them away lead Sam to cynically dub his old pal ""Captain Sunshine."" As a throwaway line its comedic possibilities only go so far but thats also the appeal of ""Last Vegas"" in a nutshell. READ MORE Michael Douglas on Following Up His Emmy Win With Last Vegas and Poking Fun at His Own Playboy Image Needless to say the cartoonish juxtaposition between Paddy and his ebullient pals takes off not through the dialogue but the slapstick quality of their performances De Niro has the gift of self-awareness that makes his deadpan restraint especially amusing as hes increasingly surrounded by the vivid colors of Vegas luxury. Douglas is on autopilot as the confident leader of the group and the ever-likable Freeman as usual barely has to do much to make us care about his screen presence. Klines snarky klutzy behavior provides the story with its comedic wild card particularly since the mans wife launches him on the trip with a condom on the condition that he never reveal the details of his revelry. Its not the first tale of an older man desperately trying to get laid but Kline tackles the scenario with consistent dopiness. Unlike ""The Hangover"" theres no complex problem surrounding the weekend that the group must bind together to solve; the very idea of their outing is the plot and theres a certain innocence to that aim that makes it hard to reject its base appeal. But ""Last Vegas"" is only slightly better than a watchable bad movie particularly when considered in the context of other far shrewder investigations into the mixture of nostalgia and regret that define the aging process in other movies released this year alone. Jem Cohens tender portrait of a platonic couple bonding over discussion of art and life in the elegant ""Museum Hours"" goes to far greater lengths in its attempt at making its characters emotional struggles into a profoundly relatable (and at times surprisingly funny) conundrum. Roger Michells ""Le Week-end"" which has currently wrapped up a festival run ahead of its 2014 release involves a near-geriatric British couple (Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan) wandering Paris on a vacation gone awry while going for the jugular in their arguments over the proper direction for their lives. Michells film in particular gets under your skin with darkly amusing exchanges between the couple that marry the humor with a philosophical sadness and vice versa. Youll find no such subtleties in ""Last Vegas"" which follows its cookie cutter plot from one point to another as it careens toward a rudimentary showdown harkening back to Billy and Paddys childhood rivalry. Every step of the way ""Last Vegas"" plays it safe. When Billy befriends a savvy lounge singer (Mary Steenburgen) closer to his own age the possible romantic developments that could complicate his marriage plans are transparently locked into place. The only real shocker arrives when Paddy emerges as the true confident leader of the bunch though it all makes a lot of sense in hindsight Nobody puts De Niro in the corner. As ""Last Vegas"" glides along satisfying expectations while always aiming low it makes peace with being inoffensively mediocre. Like Vegas itself the story goes down easy but its appeal is hard to remember once you leave it behind. Criticwire Grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Opening this Friday ""Last Vegas"" faces significant competition from ""Dallas Buyers Club"" but while that movie may have long-term prospects ""Last Vegas"" seems well-positioned to do strong business on its opening weekend before teetering off.

"Last Vegas Review A Hangover for the AARP Crowd | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Last Vegas Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 6 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr October 28 2013 | 1201AM PT Four Hollywood legends team for this wan Geritol-powered Hangover clone but its a singing and sparkling Mary Steenburgen who handily steals the show. As creaky as an arthritic hip ""Last Vegas"" does for four leading stars of the 70s and 80s what movies like ""Tough Guys"" and ""Grumpy Old Men"" did for survivors of Hollywoods storied Golden Age It lets them show they can still throw a punch bust a move and get it up and that theyre not quite ready for the Motion Picture Home just yet. Beyond that this genteel ""Hangover"" for the AARP crowd has little to recommend it though a smattering of funny gags and the nostalgia value of the cast -- none of whom curiously have ever shared the screen before -- keeps the whole thing more watchable than it has any right to be. Smartly counterprogrammed against fanboy behemoths ""Enders Game"" and ""Thor The Dark World"" this Nov. 1 CBS Films release could score nicely with its target demo but seems unlikely to match the 175 million worldwide haul of surprise 2007 hit ""The Bucket List.""This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. One doesnt exactly expect ""Death in Venice"" from a movie that begins on a shot of female cellulite jiggling beneath the surface of a Florida community pool. But as various senior-centric pics have proven from Martin Brests delightful caper ""Going in Style"" to Ron Howards ""Cocoon"" going gray isnt automatically an impediment to a screenplay that consists of more than death and Viagra jokes plus that other old reliable alta cockers rendered helpless in the face of modern technology. But ""Last Vegas"" scribe Dan Fogelman (who wrote the monumentally smarter and shrewder ""Crazy Stupid Love"") pretty much sticks to the lowest common denominator as he contrives to get four childhood friends together in Sin City for the bachelor party of the last unmarried man among them. Hes named Billy and played by a blow-dried spray-tanned Michael Douglas in what feels like a watered-down version of the actors magnificent aging lothario from 2009s ""Solitary Man"" (along with his Liberace in ""Behind the Candelabra"" the great performance of the second half of Douglas career). When Billy impulsively proposes to his strapping 31-year-old girlfriend (in the midst of delivering a friends eulogy no less) best bud Sam (Kevin Kline) -- the one trapped in that infernal Florida swimming pool -- suggests a boys weekend in Vegas and the rest of this white-haired wolf pack is soon to follow. Back when they were kids on the streets of Brooklyn Billy and his pals were known as the Flatbush Four though now theyre mainly just flat and bushed In addition to Sam theres stroke survivor Archie (Morgan Freeman essentially reprising his ""Bucket List"" character) and surly widower Paddy (Robert De Niro) who hasnt forgiven Billy for skipping out on his wifes funeral (she was their shared childhood sweetheart). From all points they converge on the ultra-luxurious Aria casino resort where they find themselves comped with a penthouse suite -- and a personal concierge (Romany Malco) -- after Archie cleans house at the blackjack table. That pretty much gives them the run of the place though they do make one important side trip to nearby Binions where Billy catches the eye of a jazz chanteuse shimmering in a sparkly mauve gown as she belts out ""Only You"" in a desolate hotel bar. The singer Diana (Mary Steenburgen) is also ""of a certain age"" and has been around the block a few times but unlike her male counterparts in ""Last Vegas"" shes been written as more than a one-dimensional type and shes played by the marvelous Steenburgen with a richness that goes even beyond whats on the page. Shes an oasis of real grown-up emotion in a movie that often feels more sophomoric (and a lot less funny) than the concurrent ""Bad Grandpa."" And though shes supposed to be a former Atlanta tax attorney who got downsized and picked up a mic Diana could just as easily be Steenburgens ebullient Lynda Dummar from ""Melvin and Howard"" a few decades on hardened by experience still looking for love in all the wrong places. The rest of the movie rarely if ever rises to Steenburgens level. Most of the comic payoffs are so obviously telegraphed that the audience can see them coming within a few frames of the setup. (When Sam whos been given dispensation by his wife to cheat on her sidles up to a tall blond stranger seen only from behind what are the chances shell turn out to be a he?) Actors like these can sometimes be a pleasure to watch even when saddled with sitcom material because their timing and delivery is still better than most. But in ""Last Vegas"" everyone seems to be on a mildly diverting paid vacation especially Freeman who can scarcely disguise his contempt for the material. He doesnt just seem to be phoning it in; he seems to be emailing it in from his trailer. Director Jon Turteltaub keeps things clicking along with the impersonal professionalism honed during his years in the Disney/Touchstone feel-good factory (""Cool Runnings"" ""Phenomenon"" ""While You Were Sleeping"") with lots of TV-friendly close-ups and touristic Vegas exteriors that could easily be recycled as stock footage. The soundtrack offers the usual golden-oldies playlist (Freemans cell phone rings Harry Chapins ""Cats in the Cradle"") save for Steenburgens lovely jazz repertoire which includes a self-penned torch song fully befitting her character ""A Cup of Trouble.""

TWITTER Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Kevin Kline and Mary Steenburgen star in director Jon Turteltaubs amiable geezers comedy. Star power counts for a helluva lot in Last Vegas an amiable geezers comedy with an affecting emotional anchor. To call this the geriatric Hangover is both accurate and misleading as the main fun here is not so much the broad humor as it is to watch five great old pros -- Michael Douglas Robert De Niro Morgan Freeman Kevin Kline and an entirely captivating Mary Steenburgen -- imparting pleasure while obviously having it themselves. Although formulaic in design and programmed to meet its quota of laughs the film makes a point of going beyond basic expectations into some legitimate aspects of mature friendships without getting soggy about it. CBS Films looks to make this visit to Vegas a profitable one. All wearing their years quite well thank you -- Freeman is the oldest at 76 Kline the youngest at 66 while De Niro is 70 and Douglas 69 -- the actors play friends who have known one another for nearly six decades as glimpsed in a Brooklyn childhood prologue. Nowadays Archie (Freeman) is a veteran of one stroke whose obsessively protective son holds him health hostage in his New Jersey home Sam (Kline) is bored in early Florida retirement with his longtime spouse and Paddy (De Niro) no longer leaves his New York apartment after his beloved wifes death. PHOTOS 19 Action Stars Kicking Butt Past 50 By extreme contrast ladies man and successful Malibu attorney Billy (Douglas) willfully ignores the calendar but finally decides its time to settle down -- with a bride about a third his age. Despite reluctance on the part of Paddy who says he hates Billy the guys agree to meet in Vegas for a bachelor party on the Saturday night before Billys Sunday wedding. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman (Crazy Stupid Love.) delivers the requisite amount of old-age shtick (Sams wife thoughtfully slips him an envelope containing a Viagra pill and a condom in the hope that some action will revitalize her husband) but quickly takes the story in a refreshingly unexpected direction with Diana (Steenburgen) a wise and sassy lounge singer whos very frank about her availability as well as the hope that Vegas will provide her with a satisfying next act to her life. Her singing style is wonderful. She teases and engages with the guys and develops a quick rapport with both Paddy and Billy that inadvertently revives the secret grudge that drove a wedge between them. For his part Sam attracts the attention of a drag queen (Roger Bart) while Archies big winnings at blackjack occasion an upgrade into the hotels most lavish suite available now that 50 Cent has canceled for the weekend. Events naturally conspire for the boys to use the enormous space to throw a wild party in the course of which Archie shows off some smooth dance moves Sam is forced to decide whether or not to use his wifes presents and 50 Cent in a cameo shows up after all to demand that the music be turned down. Director Jon Turteltaubs signal accomplishment here is to have created a congenial environment in which the actors could bond and have fun within proper boundaries. The foursomes approach to these uncomplicated characters is at once relaxed and alert loose and quick on their toes; theyre just darn good company for a couple of hours both when theyre rejecting the usual expectations to act their age but especially when theyre working through emotional issues for which even decades of experience provide inadequate preparation. In every instance the long-buried feelings that fire the dynamics of the mens character arcs cut rewardingly across the sitcommy ways the guys are initially presented. Cranky stay-at-home Paddy evolves into a man afflicted with profound romantic angst; Archies life-loving bonhomie asserts itself once he escapes his sons overbearing surveillance; Sam reverses course from premature calcification to libidinous reawakening while Billy risks renewed conflict with Paddy to at long last look beyond a womans surface charms and probe the potential of a mature romantic relationship. These may be obvious trajectories but they serve to invest a farcical context with plausible facsimiles of real people. VIDEO Last Vegas Trailer Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro Plan Their Own Hangover The actors are all great to watch. It may be that Freemans work stands out simply because since hes now most often cast in solemn grave not to say God-like roles he hasnt cut loose like this in a long time; like his character he should do it more often. At first it seems that Douglas as an L.A. playboy is just too obvious but the sensitivity and soul that Diana ushers to the surface as Billy spends more time with her elicits many grace notes from the actor. While Klines role could have benefited from more meat in the script his impeccable timing makes you pine for more mature seriocomic roles for this acting wizard. De Niro morphs his stubborn Archie Bunker-like complainer into a hurt man with a couple of exceptional grievances. And then theres Steenburgens Diana. Her musical gifts draw you in first but her self-deprecating humor wisdom of the ways of the world and fundamental optimism make her a keeper and deserving of heated competition among men. In her best film role in years the actress delivers a fully realized character from the outset and deepens it into someone you really care about even in an essentially comic context.

A thoroughly contrived and artificial bonbon that gives four screen legends of a certain age the opportunity to chase skirts and punch out guys a third of their age in some of Sin Citys glitziest nightclubs ""Last Vegas"" lives and dies by the aggregate charm and charisma of its stars since thats pretty much all it has to offer. The film is a feature-length advertisement for the Aria resort (and its concomitant Cirque du Soleil show) with some male bonding and autumnal displays of testosterone thrown in for good measure. No one would begrudge Morgan Freeman the opportunity to have a flashy dance number on screen but certainly there could be better venues for him to do so than this sexist sitcom.

Since he engineered the bachelor parties for all his childhood pals they decide to return the favor in Vegas for Archie (Freeman) its a chance to get away from the smothering concern of his son Ezra (Michael Ealy) whos been overprotective since Archies stroke and for Sam (Kevin Kline) the trip offers respite from his doddering peers in a Florida retirement community. Paddy (Robert De Niro) on the other hand has had a lifelong rivalry with Billy -- as kids they both loved the same girl who wound up marrying Paddy. The fact that Billy skipped her funeral one year previous has only made things worse. Still Archie and Sam manage to get the still-grieving Paddy out of his apartment and onto a plane to Nevada. See video Robert De Niro Can Still Throw a Punch in New Last Vegas Trailer The Billy-Paddy rivalry blossoms anew when they both fall for lounge singer Diana (Mary Steenburgen burdened with some really unflattering bangs). Beyond that each of the men gets their little bit of plot that the screenplay by Dan Fogelman (""The Guilt Trip"" ""Crazy Stupid Love"") makes clear will be resolved as neatly and tidily and blandly as possible. The situations (bikini contest bar brawl) feel like the stuff of a thousand prior Vegas movies and the characters arent written with enough specificity to feel like the lifelong chums theyre supposed to be. But Douglas De Niro Freeman and Kline collectively stuff the movie into a sack and hoist it as high as they can manage. See video Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas Party Like Its 1959 in Last Vegas Trailer Its the sort of film where the men are written with something resembling personalities while the women (with the exception of Joanna Gleason as Klines understanding wife and Steenburgen) are divided into two categories sexy young babes for our heroes (and the camera) to ogle and chubby old frumps that the movie punishes for the crime of not giving Michael Douglas an erection. Ultimately ""Last Vegas"" feels like a desperate attempt to graft ""The Hangover"" onto ""Grumpy Old Men"" (or perhaps ""The Golden Girls"") and while the transplant never quite takes you wont lose your affection for the surgeons.
