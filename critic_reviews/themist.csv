Comments (1) The Mist Recommended A heavy mist comes rolling over a New England town trapping several dozen people inside the local supermarket and to their horror they realize the swirling whiteness conceals a breed of huge bloodthirsty insects. Frank Darabont directing his third Stephen King adaptation (after The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile) takes full advantage of the mists visual ellipses to create almost unbearable suspense and the same aesthetic carries over into the narrative which employs an unusual number of fades. Darabont doesnt match the sly cultural commentary of The Host a recent Korean import that also revamped the giant-monster genre but his grocery-store survival drama dominated by Marcia Gay Harden as a shrill fundamentalist serves as a crude but effective allegory for post-9/11 America.

"Review The Mist is bold and frightening - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review The Mist is bold and frighteningStory Highlights ""The Mist"" based on a Stephen King story has real punch Movie written directed by Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption"") Film has some holes but the ending is spectacular Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Its the end of the world -- again Thomas Jane (left) tries to keep his wits while coping with ""The Mist."" Doomsday scenarios have become a familiar sight in the movies since the beginning of the Cold War and for the most part ""Stephen Kings The Mist"" from a King novella sticks closely to the archetype. Thats not a problem. If youve seen writer-director Frank Darabonts films (including two King adaptations ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" that earned him Oscar nominations) youll know hes an old-time Hollywood classicist at heart. Its his ability to reinvest these familiar strains with meaning thats impressive. David Drayton (Thomas Jane who holds the screen effortlessly here) is with his son at the grocery store when the fog rolls in and with it a terrified and bleeding local yelling how theres something nasty in the mist. The market is busy -- people are restocking after a big storm -- and an alarm cuts through the building like a chill. It sounds like a bomb warning; the sound you might hear in the event of an attack. A man rushes out to his car but no sooner has he been swallowed up by the mist than he lets rip a blood-curdling scream. Nobodys eager to follow in his footsteps. As is traditional in this kind of story the phones are dead so the good people of Castle Rock are on their own. Curiously theyre not much concerned that the mist itself might be toxic -- surely the most rational explanation. Its only when a giant grasping tentacle slides into the loading bay that they begin to appreciate the true nature of the threat -- and even then those shoppers who missed the show have a hard time buying it. Never a filmmaker to run when he can walk Darabont lets the horror build through unease incredulity and mounting suggestion. Cannily he keeps Mark Ishams score in his back pocket and reaches for it sparingly. In one of his best bits a volunteer ties a rope around his waist and ventures into the unknown. Darabont stays fixed in the store and lets the pull on the rope tell the story. Pure suspense. When the monsters do reveal themselves the CGI work is seamless and properly repellent but dont worry yourself about where they come from or why. Darabonts focus is always squarely on the humans who quickly splinter into competing factions reflecting their own racial class and educational prejudices. The mental mist that clouds everyones judgment is the real theme of the story denial frustration despair and enough reckless courage to keep the body count going up. And when it comes to scary Marcia Gay Hardens born-again proselytizer is fearsome enough to convince Drayton and his clique to take their chances with the beasties. Pleasingly tight in scale (Darabont brought over the production team from TVs ""The Shield"") ""The Mist"" shoots itself in the foot with a couple of clumsy episodes. Ill accept giant tentacles but its hard to believe that Drayton cant convince the townfolk to go take a peek at the evidence. Stalwart character actors Toby Jones William Sadler and Frances Sternhagen make strong impressions but Hardens religious rapture sucks all the air out of the room (its always hard to make fundamentalists seem credible). A belated attempt to ""humanize"" a younger couple rings hollow and might have been cut. ""The Mist"" is far from perfect and its woefully humorless. But such reservations have to be weighed against a mind-blowing ending so bold I can hardly believe Darabont got away with it. Dont they test-screen movies any more? ""The Mist"" may not be Oscar bait but its a horror movie of real conviction. It deserves to be a hit. ""The Mist"" is rated R and runs 127 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"The Mist Mist opportunity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Mist Mist opportunityHeres a skill-testing multiple-choice question prompted by The Mist  Frank Darabonts adaptation of the Stephen King novella about creeping nasties invading a foggy town.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 23 2007 Starring Thomas Jane Marcia Gay Harden Toby Jones Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden. Written and directed by Frank Darabont. 127 minutes. At major theatres. R  Heres a skill-testing multiple-choice question prompted by The Mist Frank Darabonts adaptation of the Stephen King novella about creeping nasties invading a foggy town.Article Continued BelowQ. Terrified inhabitants of a besieged grocery store having already witnessed horrific events hear of someone being munched by a slithery beastie in the loading dock. Do they(a) Believe the report and take immediate action to prevent further attacks;(b) Congratulate the messenger for his brave rescue attempts and vow to back him every step of the way;(c) Accuse the messenger of making a bad joke threaten him with violence and venture into the threatening cloud.If you answered (c) youre right in tune with The Mist which is dopey even by standards of B-movies where brain cells are always the first casualty. If there were prizes handed out for making the worst possible responses to an emergency situation this one would win hands down.Yet even though it is mindless at least until the provocative ending The Mist manages to provide some decent old-school shocks. The previous Darabont/King collaborations The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile were uncommonly brainy entertainments; this time theyre happy to settle for just the entertaining part.As the bearer of bad news about beastly acts and also the films least-incompetent hero Thomas Jane gets to display some of the all-American grit that The Punisher failed to demonstrate.Hes David Drayton an artist living in the coastal town Castle Rock Me. whose response to a terrifyingly freakish storm and fog is to go grocery shopping with his 9-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble).Its an impulse shared by the rest of the town including Bible-thumping bore Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden seriously slumming) and the requisite King slices o Americana a biker a lawyer a school teacher an officious boss various slack-jawed yokels and soldiers from the Army base up yonder that has been engaged in weird science (cue ominous music).For the better part of two hours its your basic bug hunt. The grocery store prisoners get used to attacks by all manner of giant insects raptors tentacled thingies and other critters sent by the monster version of central casting. But they dont get much better at fighting them even though - this being an American grocery store - there are ample supplies of beer plus a few handy weapons stowed in handbags boots and in the hardware section.Youd think for example that residents wouldnt need to be told that bright shining lights attract insects. Or that indiscriminately spraying lighter fluid near flames could cause unwanted havoc.But then comes the ending markedly different from Kings own and reportedly changed with his blessing. At a stroke The Mist changes from dumb diversion to something of real consequence bringing to life this bitter exchange heard earlier""You dont have much faith in humanity do you?""""None whatsoever.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Thomas Jane Marcia Gay Harden and Andre Braugher. Directed by Frank Darabont. (R. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One of the first images youll see in ""The Mist"" is a movie poster of John Carpenters ""The Thing."" That 1982 classic was arguably the creative peak of the last generation of horror filmmaking filled with more than the requisite amount of gore but also intelligence and a sense of building paranoia that you hardly ever see today. The latest Frank Darabont-directed movie based on a Stephen King book does a decent job of replicating that experience - so much so that the films dialogue-heavy pace takes about a half hour to get used to. But the movie has plenty of payoff especially in the exciting and nerve-wracking final hour. You can try guessing what will happen next but youll probably be wrong. Darabont previously used Kings source material for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a film that remains underrated even as it has played on TV every other hour for the past decade. ""The Green Mile"" was another solid Darabont/King pairing - at least until those stupid bees started flying out of Michael Clarke Duncans mouth. ""The Mist"" is considerably grimmer than either of those films with a much stronger supernatural sci-fi bent. Scarcely five minutes into the movie a relentless fog filled with man-eating creatures rolls into the familiar creepy town limits of Castle Rock Maine. Artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son are holed up in a supermarket with a large group of townspeople who have the capacity to become just as dangerous as what is outside the doors. What happens next wont be discussed here because the twists and turns are what elevate ""The Mist"" from Roger Corman B-movie territory to something considerably more substantial. Like ""The Thing"" allegiances shift and plans change constantly - with heroes and villains emerging from unexpected places. Darabont also wrote the screenplay for ""The Mist"" and once again he does a great job of making even the one-note characters interesting. Jane is kind of mopey as the main survivor especially compared to some of the memorable performances in smaller roles. Toby Jones is better as a runtish but resourceful grocery checker and Marcia Gay Harden stands out as a religious zealot whose ""end of days"" talk starts to make a lot more sense when a swarm of giant locust-creatures is buzzing the market. (Darabont also must have been a fan of ""Cheers"" - when things go bad that actress who played Cliff Clavins mother gets all the best lines.) While its riveting throughout ""The Mist"" is a bit bloated especially in the beginning when something weird will happen then several characters will spend the next 10 minutes discussing the event. Horror fans who like their thrills cheap wont like how this one is staged like a play. The special effects can also look a bit rubbery although in my opinion that mostly adds to the fun especially when the bugs are being doused in lighter fluid and stabbed with sharpened mop handles. Whoever was in charge of marketing ""The Mist"" deserves a swift kick for including in the latest commercial a huge give-away scene from the last two minutes of the movie. It telegraphs a shocking ending that would be considerably better if you werent waiting for it to happen. That ending will be controversial - especially for the ""Shawshank Redemption"" alls-well-that-ends-in-Zihuatanejo crowd. It isnt as infuriating as the crap that ""The Village"" director M. Night Shyamalan has been pulling lately but there are lapses in logic and a Cormac McCarthy ending that doesnt quite fit with the rest of the films tone. Then again the unexpected is part of what makes a movie like ""The Mist"" satisfying. The usual horror movie rules where the biggest stars and hottest women always die last dont necessarily apply here. And much like the residents of Castle Rock you definitely wont see everything thats coming around the next bend. -- Advisory This film contains horror movie gore violence children in peril profanity and interpretations of the Old Testament that taken literally may encourage human sacrifice.

BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 344 PM The MistHorror movie about a monster-filled fog enveloping a supermarket in Maine. With Thomas Jane Marcia Gay Harden Toby Jones. Director Frank Darabont (211). R Language graphic gore/violence. At area theaters.In a season weighted with dark-themed movies the darkest of all may be Frank Darabonts adaptation of Stephen Kings short story ""The Mist.""A combination monster/disaster movie it explores issues as fundamentally elusive as the nature of man the existence of God and the purpose of religion and its conclusions arent going to leave anybody feeling too good about whatever they believe. The brutally ironic ending I might add wont make anybody very happy about having chosen ""The Mist"" for their evenings entertainment. Darabont has made two uplifting movies from other King stories - ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" - but this one is the ultimate in downers. ""The Mist"" occurs in a bucolic mountain village in Maine where on the morning after a freakishly violent electrical storm a mist - more accurately a pea-soup fog - begins to crawl up the valley. No ordinary weather event this fog contains an otherworldly melange of giant insects pterodactyls disembodied tentacles and at least one four-legged creature the size of an oil derrick. And every one is meaner than a junkyard dog. Our view of this phenomenon which is attributed to reckless experiments at a nearby military base is from the inside of a shrouded supermarket where a couple dozen people are trapped. As the monsters begin to show themselves the terrified shoppers separate into opposing camps. One follows the common-sense logic of David Drayton (Thomas Jane) a poster artist with a young son in tow. The other galvanizes around Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) an end-of-days fanatic. She believes that only through human sacrifice - Draytons son is her first choice - can they survive the wrath of God foretold in the Old Testament. Draytons followers are much more fun. They include Frances Sternhagen as a wisened elder whos not opposed to stoning Carmody with canned peas and Toby Jones playing a modest store clerk with unexpected resolve. Some great special-effects work went into the realization of the strange critters we see flying slithering and scampering about and there are welcome moments of comic relief. But dont get your hopes up. With this kind of mist nothing good can come of it. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Christy Lemire updated 11/19/2007 61702 PM ET 2007-11-19T231702 Print Font + - REVIEW The first two times Frank Darabont adapted and directed a story by Stephen King -- ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" -- the results were dramatically compelling and duly acclaimed but they didnt leave you tensed up and terrified in your seat. They werent trying to. ""The Mist"" is and it succeeds beautifully. Its a reflection of both mens horror roots -- in the late 80s Darabont wrote the remake of ""The Blob"" the third ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie and ""The Fly II"" and King ... well you know who he is -- but its also a welcome return to the kind of subtle slowly building scares we dont see anymore in this overly graphic age of torture porn. In bringing to the screen Kings 1980 short story about a deadly mist that engulfs an insular Maine town Darabont makes masterful use of silence and stripped-down documentary-style camerawork that naturally places you in the middle of the action. (Its a visual style he borrowed from directing an episode of the powerful TV police drama ""The Shield""; he also borrowed the shows director of photography Rohn Schmidt.) For those of you who know the story hes also changed the ending making it less vague and more devastating. But were getting ahead of ourselves now. Thomas Jane Marcia Gay Harden Andre Braugher and Toby Jones are among the residents trapped in a supermarket when the mist hits bringing with it some dazzlingly dangerous creatures. Perhaps its origin is a bit too facile too overtly symbolic but the way it breaks the characters down to their most fundamental traits exposing them at their ugliest and bravest is a fascinating spectacle to behold. Jane is a solid everyman as David Drayton who goes to the grocery store with his young son Billy (Nathan Gamble) to stock up on supplies after a freak storm knocks out the power and causes a tree to crash through the family house. Everyone else is there too having found themselves in the same vulnerable situation; even Davids next-door neighbor a hotshot lawyer played by Braugher has gotten a ride into town with him despite their long-standing feud. Advertise Advertise Advertise That spirit of teamwork serves them all well when the mist rolls in -- at first that is. They know its ominous and mysterious and theyve heard reports that at least one person has been seriously injured because of it. Only in time does its full wrath become obvious. As one employee puts it with humorous understatement ""It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude."" Slideshow Celebrity Sightings Store manager Ollie (Jones who played Truman Capote so convincingly in ""Infamous"") tries to calm people down but Hardens freaky shrieky religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody is more adept at grabbing their attention with her prophecies of biblical revenge and doom. People think shes nuts at first -- one old lady hurls a can of peas at her -- but as the situation grows dire she finds herself holding increasing sway -- and liking it. (Hardens performance will elicit a visceral reaction thats how good she is.) To say much more would be to deny you the riveting revelations that are in store. Yes something is in the mist. Lots of things are in the mist. Theyre gorgeous and frightening and strange and elaborately detailed and the effects used to create them allow them to blend in seamlessly with the live action. Theyll make you jump all right. Quite a few times. But its what the humans to do each other thats more likely to shake you to your core. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Mist Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mist-2007,200,themist10,themist,rogerebert
"Reasons to watch this get lost in The Mist - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Reasons to watch this get lost in The Mist Laurie Holden Thomas Jane (center) and Nathan Gamble star in Frank Darabonts adaptation of a Stephen King story. (Johansen Krause/Metro-Goldwyn Mayer) Email|Print| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / November 21 2007 Spoiler warning The critic will give away the end of the movie in the third to last paragraph of this review. If you intend to see the film by all that is holy stop reading before then. You have been warned.If you want to use a genre movie - sci-fi action musical whatever - to make a larger statement about humanity its best to keep things lean and tight by inserting said message into the metaphorical cracks. This is what the first two versions of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" did and that worked out nicely.With ""The Mist"" a reasonably scary big-bug movie based on a Stephen King novella writer-director Frank Darabont takes the opposite tack He blows out the running time and spackles his social observations on top like frosting. Darabont believes hes an important filmmaker and why shouldnt he? For reasons that escape me and many others his 1994 drama ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ranked the second-best movie of all time in voter ratings at the Internet Movie Database. (Its a perfectly fine film but 2? Better than ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Casablanca"" and even ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest""?)That bloated sense of purpose turns what could have been a nifty B-movie into a strained two-hours-plus ""Twilight Zone"" episode and believe me Darabonts no Rod Serling.Im serious Major spoilers ahead. Stephen King has publicly stated that anyone who spills the beans deserves the death penalty but Im willing to take the risk.Like the old John Carpenter shrieker ""The Fog"" ""The Mist"" gets rolling when a mysterious cloud bank descends on a coastal town (this being Stephen King were in Maine). There are things in this unholy white-out they have teeth and theyre extremely hungry. So far so good.The filmmaker has been watching a lot of Hitchcock and ""The Mist"" plays like the diner sequence in ""The Birds"" padded to fill an entire movie. Theres been a nasty storm the night before and the supermarket is filled with locals and weekend Richie Riches filling up their grocery carts. Theyre all trapped inside when the fog comes down and were trapped with them.Our hero is David Drayton (Thomas Jane) a successful local movie-poster artist. His young son Billy (Nathan Gamble) has come shopping with him as has his New York-attorney neighbor (Andre Braugher) with whom David has a prickly relationship. As the bodies pile up outside the crowd divides into panicked groups. The local crazy lady (Marcia Gay Harden biting into her role as if her agent had presented her with a prize ham) starts preaching that its the end of the world and the stores weaker vessels start listening to her as the days wear on. David anchors a saner group that includes assistant store manager Ollie (Toby Jones - the other Truman Capote) a feisty schoolmarm (Frances Sternhagen) and several others. And look heres the towns pretty new schoolteacher Amanda played by Laurie Holden with Tippi Hedrens hair and Kim Novaks ""Vertigo"" wardrobe.You think Im kidding? Im not. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. Can I make this any clearer?The set-up then is 50 or so little Indians with hellspawn banging on the windows outside. (Theres a cursory explanation; this being King it involves the military.) Darabonts more interested in watching his characters call each other out over perceived class differences though; he also gives Harden about 10 too many apocalyptic rants about the ""Book of Revelations"" (sic). Dont expect the movie to play well in the Bible Belt. Dont expect it to play with the Motion Picture Editors Guild either since there appears to have been a cutting-room lock-out.Despite all this ""The Mist"" holds its tension for the most part alternating frenzied eek-eek-eek sequences with periods of taut silent dread. The special effects are well done and the ones that arent are hidden by that convenient fog. After a while though the movie wants to make big statements about the Madness of Crowds and at this length theyre trite and heavy-handed.Then as if to underscore that hes above such silly things as sci-fi and horror Darabont throws his curveball of an ending. (OK last chance. Exits that way. Abandon hope all ye who enter here.) Having escaped with three others David and little Billy drive through the mist until their car runs out of gas. Around them are the shrieks of horrible things ready to pounce and rend. The five humans have a gun with four bullets; David does what he must and exits the car alone to await his fate. Two minutes later the army shows up. Bum-mer.I dont think you have to be a parent to hate a movie that ends with the kid getting shot in the head by his dad. As a favor. And just think All they had to do was turn on the car radio.Someone must think such a finale is dark and daringly tragic and uncomfortable and cool. Someone is wrong. ""The Mist"" doesnt provoke further thought; it provokes active annoyance at being punished in the service of a pulp morality tale with pretensions. Even Hitchcock knew that When he blew up the little boy in the bus in 1936s ""Sabotage"" he ended up having to issue a public apology. And Darabont need I say it is no Hitchcock.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com unless youre Stephen King in which case he has moved to Tierra del Fuego with no forwarding address.

"Mist The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mist-the ) Mist The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Mist is what a horror film should be - dark tense and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewers flinch reflex intact. In fact that movies ending is so uncompromising that one must assume director Frank Darabont had final cut so the studio couldnt interfere. (Its worth noting that the ending is not the same as that of Stephen Kings novella but I wont mention how it has changed.) Darabont has fashioned a tense motion pictures thats ultimately more about paranoia religious fanaticism and the price of hopelessness than it is about monsters. But the creatures are present and accounted for lurking in the white-out that is the mist. Someone has finally succeeded where John Carpenter failed with The Fog. Darabont who was an established screenwriter before trying his hand at directing with 1994s The Shawshank Redemption has made four motion pictures. The Mist is the third one that uses a Stephen King story as source material. Before The Mist Darabont stuck to Kings ""straight"" stories but this time he takes a turn for the horrific. What he does right however is to focus more on the interplay between the characters than on the monsters. By the end one wonders which group is more savage us or them. Darabonts theme in some ways echoes a sentiment voiced by Ellen Ripley in Aliens that human beings can be as bad or worse than the nightmares that sometimes hunt them. (The movie borrows other things from the Alien series including the expulsion of creatures from the body and the cocooning of victims.) The Mist starts out in the ""normal"" world before quickly taking a journey into the surreal. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is painting in his studio when a violent storm hits. In the aftermath one tree has come through his studio window and another has flattened his boathouse. As he; his son Billy (Nathan Gamble); and his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) head into town to the supermarket an eerie mist is spreading across the lake. The supermarket is a picture of chaos with the power out but its about to get much worse. The mist blows in enveloping everything and someone enters the supermarket with blood on his face screaming that theres something out there. Its not long before David and some of the other shoppers and store employees get a glimpse of what that ""something"" is. Meanwhile religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) believes this is a sign of the coming apocalypse and that God has designated her to lead the unfaithful to salvation - perhaps by sacrificing those who reject her ranting. The majority of the film takes place within the supermarket although the most tense scenes are those in which one or more characters leaves its relative ""safety"" for a short period. Inside as the terrified and trapped people grow increasingly more tense the population fractures into three groups those who believe in the supernatural explanation and follow Mrs. Carmody; those who reject that anything serious is wrong and follow Brent Norton and those who know there are monsters but dont think praying is the answer and follow David. Its a story we have seen before while the demons gather their forces in the darkness the humans bicker amongst themselves. The Mist provides some unlikely heroes. Thomas Janes David is a typical square-jawed good-looking protagonist whose quick thinking and common sense approach makes him a person others gravitate toward during a crisis. But some of the biggest blows are struck by nerdy Ollie (Toby Jones) and elderly Irene (Frances Sternhagen). These two get the biggest cheers when they go on monster-killing rampages. Meanwhile Marcia Gay Hardens performance as the unhinged prophet Mrs. Carmody makes the skin crawl. And Laurie Holden plays one of Davids most faithful followers - a young school teacher whose primary purpose is to provide comfort to Billy. The special effects are both a strength and a weakness. They are effective when portraying monsters seen through the gloom of the mist. (Theres one horrific and awe-inspiring moment late in the movie.) When seen a little closer and clearer however the CGI is too apparent. Atmosphere is Darabonts strength. Its what drives the movie - wondering and fearing what might be out there preparing to launch itself at the huge plate glass windows that front a supermarket. Using ingredients supplied by King the director brews a potent stew that concludes with a scene tinged with the most bitter irony imaginable. If theres a fault its in the ""explanation"" that details what the mist is and why the creatures are displacing humankind. This has tacked-on obligatory feel. The scenario might have worked better if it was left to our imagination to figure out where the monsters come from or why they are here. Like time travel the more the filmmakers try to explain it the more lame it sounds. Fortunately its a small part of an otherwise superbly made motion picture. Finally after a long list of failures someone has done justice in bringing one of Kings horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesnt demand ""torture porn"" from horror.

Yesterday a sold-out Jacobs Field crowd saw something that may never happen again. Mariano Rivera is human. Sandy Alomar proved that five years ago in the same stadium. So too did Luis Gonzalez in last years World Series. So you know Rivera is going to get beat. Yet when the Yankees best closer gives up six runs in the ninth and turns a victory into a 10-7 defeat by giving up a walk-off grand slam to somebody named Bill Selby something that will never happen again just happened. ""I cant do anything about it now. It was a tough one to lose"" Rivera said after making the walk from mound to clubhouse where he pushed around a plate of food with a fork and knife but wasnt very interested in eating much of it. ""Especially the way [Mike Mussina] pitched. But I cant do nothing about it."" Derek Jeter spoke for all the stunned faces in a somber clubhouse. ""I am sure it will happen again but I dont see it happening to [Rivera] again"" Jeter said. Since the Yankees were three outs away from going four games up on the slumping Red Sox the defeat cut to the bone and kept them three lengths ahead of the Bosox who lost three straight to the Blue Jays. Asked to preserve a 7-4 lead in the ninth two games after having his streak of 17 straight saves stopped Friday night on an Omar Vizquel single Rivera gave up singles to John McDonald and Eddie Perez the No. 8 and 9 hitters. That put runners at the corners for Chris Magruder. Magruder brought back visions of last years World Series Game 7 when he hit a grounder to Rivera who short-hopped Jeter at second with a throw that got a force. The nanosecond Jeter needed to pick the ball out of the dirt made a difference when Magruder beat the throw to first as McDonald scored from third. ""I cant think of an explanation for that I didnt throw it. I guided it a little bit"" said Rivera who botched a similar play that helped lose last years World Series against Arizona. Still it was 7-5 and these were the Indians against Rivera who was throwing 95-mph aspirins. Vizquel then turned on a fastball and singled to right to send Magruder to third. Ellis Burks followed with a double to left-center that scored Magruder and suddenly the 7-0 Yankees lead after 31/2 innings was shaved to one. With runners on second and third and one out Rivera intentionally walked Jim Thome to load the bases for pinch-hitter Travis Fryman. Rivera fanned Fryman on three 96-mph fastballs in Frymans eyes that he missed badly on. That brought up Selby a 32-year-old left-handed hitting infielder with five major-league homers in 259 at-bats. Rivera fell behind 2-0 and got it to 2-2 when Selby missed hitting the right-field line by a foot. Despite the scare Rivera wasnt going to change. If Selby could hit a 95-mph cutter on the inner part of the plate so be it. ""I wanted it in a little more he got my best pitch and he hit it"" said Rivera who has blown four of 26 save chances.

Wells (Food of the Gods) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (The Land That Time Forgot).Its probably the worst of the three King stories so far adapted by three-time Oscar-nominated director Frank Darabont. But this is no diss considering that the French-born American directors previous King flicks are the critically acclaimed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Darabont who drops the gooey Spielbergian sentimentality that mars the other King films gives us plenty of creature thrills but focuses the story on those other monsters humans and how we turn on each other in a crisis. The flick stars Thomas Jane as David Drayton an iteration of that ol King standby the stand-up guy from Main Street USA who never forgets his code of ethics and never gives up on humanity. David whos out shopping with his 8-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble) when the mist arrives is stuck in a supermarket with a cross-section of society including a contrarian lawyer three Army buds two sub-Mensa blue-collar types and Mrs. Carmody. Played with dreadful precision by Marcia Gay Harden Carmody stirs up the crowd by preaching a savage paganized version of Christianity. She tells everyone they are being punished by God for being modern. Her solution? Not prayer or helping the widow and the orphan. She thirsts for blood She wants to offer a human sacrifice to The Beast in the mist. The commentary on religion is unusually sharp for a horror flick King shows how scapegoating is one of our oldest impulses around since we climbed out of the primal goop. Its an easy shortcut for people who dont want to do the hard work of religion which demands self-examination and compassionate rational conversation. Add a potent mix of nicely orchestrated melees and gore to this Religionskritik and youve got a winner. Almost. At 127 minutes The Mist is too long. It loses momentum and gets mired in trivialities too often. But if you like your suspense bleak (and dont mind a dose of silliness on the side) The Mist is a refreshing walk on the dread side.Contact Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2736 or tirdadphillynews.com Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

His The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile were critical hits - certainly something that cant be said of all movies based on Kings work (see Christine Cujo The Dark Half etc.). The Mist isnt quite up there with Durabonts previous King interpretations which isnt surprising. They were based on a couple of Kings less scary tales while The Mist is the closest thing to an out-and-out horror story - with nasty creatures from different dimensions menacing people - that Durabont has attempted. But The Mist does pack some scares and features a knockout performance from Marcia Gay Harden as a religious wacko who has found her moment; trapped in a supermarket with several people in a small Maine town she is every bit as scary as the beasties flying around outside. The setup is classic King A raging storm knocks out power topples trees and sends people streaming into the supermarket to stock up on supplies. But the aftermath of this storm is different. A strange mist is floating over the water and heading for the town. Once it gets there . . . not good. The mist is thick so the townspeople trapped in the store cant quite tell whats going on outside but the screams - and the occasional bloody evidence - are clues that they dont want to risk escape. Thomas Jane stars as David the de facto leader of the group at least at first. His discovery of something very odd and very dangerous in the storage room in the back of the store divides the group; Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) a New York lawyer convinces some of those holed up that things are less dangerous outside than inside. Interesting theory. Good luck with that. Then there is Mrs. Carmody (Harden). Everyone has always assumed that shes just batty but as the situation worsens becoming more apocalyptic by the hour some of the crowd starts to listen to her ravings a little more closely - because theyre starting to make a little more sense. The Mist strives to be as much about the conflict within the store as without but in a film where special-effects monsters keep making unwelcome appearances thats a tough sell. (The cheesiness of the special effects doesnt help.) But it does deliver some chills that are no less scary for being straightforward. Jane is serviceable as David a rather lackluster and reluctant hero. Braugher always good is so again as the arrogant Norton. But Harden is simply outstanding as Carmody her confidence rising as she begins to sense her growing power. Its not a nuanced performance not by a long shot but it is enormously entertaining. Hardens performance lifts The Mist above the rank-and-file horror film. Its not a classic but it is scary and youll definitely leave the theater thinking about the ending (so surprising King himself has threatened writers not to reveal it; consider the warning heeded).

By Anthony Lane Cate Blanchett as one of the Dylanesque characters in Todd Hayness new movie.   Credit COURTESY ED LACHMAN/THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY (2007) The new Todd Haynes film ""Im Not There"" is not a documentary about Bob Dylan. His name is in the opening credits of the movie (""inspired by the music amp; many lives of Bob Dylan"") and his face looms in closeup at the end cheeks sucking and swelling to the rhythm of a harmonica but those are his only appearances. Nor is the film a straightforward dramatization of his existence or even a slice of it; anyone expecting a Dylanite echo of ""Backbeat"" which retold the story of the Beatles time in Hamburg may have reason to be aggrieved. Ian Hart played John Lennon in that film with recognizable punch and wit but nobody here plays the actual Dylan. Instead six actors take six different roles and run with them each role being a loopy meandering riff on the sort of life that Dylan has had or could have had or conjured in his songs. It makes ""Yellow Submarine"" look like a miracle of sober narrative. Take the first example. A young guitar-toting black kid (Marcus Carl Franklin) hops a freight train finds a pair of hoboes and declares that his name is Woody Guthrie. The time is the late nineteen-fifties. The kid shows up throughout the film and we have the pleasure of seeing him perform--an eager unfeigned pleasure because Franklin can really sing and he gets the chance for a brisk trio on a front porch with none other than Richie Havens plucking away beside him. The question is What is the kid doing in a film about Dylan? Well you could view him as an oblique comment on Dylans own reverence for Guthrie (as evidenced by ""Song to Woody"" on his debut album) and on the debt that he owed to a particular strain of black music but thats the problem this ""Woody Guthrie"" is a comment not a character. We are kept so busy trying to weigh the burden of cultural meaning that the poor kid has to carry that we never find time to grant him as a person anything but the most fleeting of existences. Like the other pseudo-Dylans who populate the story he is there for a purpose and behind the gleam of the film--Haynes has an exacting eye for decor and the rural American past is drenched in sap greens and warm tobacco browns--there is no mistaking a hard Brechtian sense of dramatis personae being used like tools. Nonetheless Marcus Carl Franklin operating on sheer brio makes more of an impact than most of his fellow-performers. Four of the other Dylan figures all played by capable actors are left stranded in the luscious mire of Hayness fantasies. Ben Whishaw who starred in the malodorous ""Perfume"" is interviewed as though under arrest and gives his name as ""Arthur Rimbaud."" (To help us connect the dots a version of Rimbauds most famous phrase ""I is someone else"" is uttered later by another character. Those in the know will feel smug; everyone else will be baffled.) Christian Bale as authentically gaunt as the folk-era Dylan plays Jack Rollins who shows up in New York and transfixes the musical scene; toward the end he emerges as a born-again Christian pastor in California--a deliberate overstretch by Haynes since Dylan though he turned to God in the late seventies was never a minister. Then there is Heath Ledger who plays an actor named Robbie who himself plays the fractionally Dylan-like hero in ""Grain of Sand"" a nonexistent Hollywood film and whose wooing of a French painter (Charlotte Gainsbourg) takes up an unlikely slice of the action. Got that? Just as youre wondering how much farther from the art of Bob Dylan this movie is prepared to stray up pops Richard Gere. This I fear is where my patience snapped and I doubt whether that of Dylan fans will prove any more elastic. Gere plays Billy--a nod to Billy the Kid and thus to the music that Dylan contributed to Sam Peckinpahs ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973) in which he also acted. But the Gere rendition is little more than a lazy gloss on the legend of the vanishing West; as a rule any film that offers cameos to circus performers and random zoo animals has reached the point at which invention becomes desperation. The problem for ""Im Not There"" is not one of credibility (after all these tales are meant to be tall) but of what authority a movie retains when its component parts fly off in different directions. Dylan to judge by the ardor of his admirers is indeed inexhaustible in his gifts as in his changes of tack and one quite understands why Haynes--who co-wrote the film with Oren Moverman--should have scorned a plain bio-pic. To come at a stubborn subject from multiple angles was a smart move but Haynes is so enthralled by the stylistic opportunities that his plan affords as he was in the fifties-hued ""Far from Heaven"" that he ends up more interested in the angles than in anything else leaving the elusive Dylan once again to slip away. If the new film does cohere for a while that is thanks to Cate Blanchett who armed with curly wig and shades delivers Jude Quinn the most gripping of the Dylans on display. She looks like Elizabeth I after a long night out with Walter Raleigh and his packet of virgin smokes. We see Jude in London in the mid-sixties hazy with drugs larking with the Beatles (in a breakneck homage to ""A Hard Days Night"") and generally treading the ground that was covered by D. A. Pennebaker in ""Dont Look Back"" (1967) his concert-tour documentary. The best thing in the film is the probing of Judes past and conscience by a British journalist (Bruce Greenwood) whose questions about the responsibility that the artist--any artist from Dylan on down--bears to the wider world are left blowing in the wind. Blanchett seems to yield herself to the project with more gusto and curiosity than the others as if there were truths about Dylan that need to be unearthed not merely toyed with and she is unafraid to remind us of what a pain the man could be especially when stoned but even she has to wrestle with the camp knowingness of the script (""Im the only one with any balls"") and more alarming with the flimsiness of the context. ""Live your own time child. Sing about your own time"" the young black Dylan is told and the instruction could stand as the motto of the movie; so why palm off on us a few stock-footage shots of Martin Luther King Jr. mass riots and Nixons declaring an end to the war in Vietnam? How can we judge Dylans place in history when the history feels paper thin? ""Im Not There"" is bravely conceived but some of the reconstructions of the folk movement could have come straight out of ""A Mighty Wind"" and what exactly Haynes adds to ""Dont Look Back"" or to Martin Scorseses majestic ""No Direction Home Bob Dylan"" released two years ago only Dylanologists can tell. The rest of us far from seeing the light may even be led to ask heretically what all the fuss was about. So who is this movie for? In the second scene of ""The Mist"" we see mist rolling across a lake. A little boy asks his father ""What is it Daddy?"" ""Mist"" he replies. I do like movies that keep me fully abreast of all the relevant information and Frank Darabonts new film certainly fits the bill. Adapted from a novella by Stephen King it stars Thomas Jane as David Drayton a poster artist whose Maine home is like most of the surrounding area badly damaged in an electrical storm. After the tempest comes the mist and out of the mist comes the stuff of nightmares complete with stings jaws giant tentacles acidic webs and a host of optional extras not covered by Draytons insurance. He does the only sensible thing which is to leave his wife behind and hole up in the local supermarket with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and Norton (Andre Braugher) the attorney next door. As it turns out Nortons job is to represent the voice of reason. Decrying all the talk of tentacles as mischievous delusion he and a few fellow-rationalists step out into the mist giving everyone else the chance for a debate--slightly surprising given the circumstances--on moral philosophy. The delicious unattached schoolteacher (Laurie Holden) considers mankind decent at heart whereas the small existentialist checkout clerk (Toby Jones) feels that ""as a species were fundamentally insane."" Mind you its not long since Jones played Truman Capote in ""Infamous"" so he may be arguing from unstable premises. ""The Mist"" is itself a supermarket of B-movie essentials handsomely stocked with bad science stupid behavior chewable lines of dialogue religious fruitcakes and a fine display of monsters. One of these toward the end is cathedral-high and the characters gaze upon it with genuine wonder although its low bellowing suggests that it may have eaten too many fruitcakes at one sitting. The finale--a cruel Stephen King joke--is designed to convince us that we have been watching something more than hokum but I am unpersuaded. The line ""Theres something in the mist"" is a straight lift from ""Theres something in the fog"" spoken twenty-seven years ago in John Carpenters ""The Fog"" and it shows that these movies are not meditations on the tragedy of human overreach. Theyre weather reports. Isnt that scary enough?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Upstanding residents go about their business which includes shopping for groceries after a storm. Then a thick mean white wet fog rolls in and with it come giant hideous creatures from a hellish other dimension (some buglike and winged others tentacled and slimy) hungry for anyone caught outside. So those in the supermarket barricade themselves inside. And then the real human-on-human evil begins. The bugs and such are gross enough -- and yet so very handsome -- in Frank Darabonts nifty unusually spry and almost shockingly pessimistic low-budget adaptation of Kings 1980 extended short story. (Abandon all hope ye who remember the original unresolved ending.) But its the good people of classic Kingville brought to life by an energized cast including Thomas Jane Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden who ought to scare the bejesus out of audiences. Theres a grim modern parable to be read into the dangerous effects of the gospel-preaching local crazy lady Mrs. Carmody (brilliantly played by a hellfire Marcia Gay Harden) on a congregation of the fearful. Under the circumstances when a feisty neighbor (Frances Sternhagen) bonks Mrs. C on the head with a can of peas the gesture counts as a declaration of independence.

Much nastier and less genteel than his best-known Stephen King adaptations (""The Shawshank Redemption"" ""The Green Mile"") Frank Darabonts screw-loose doomsday thriller works better as a gross-out B-movie than as a psychological portrait of mankind under siege marred by one-note characterizations and a tone that veers wildly between snarky and hysterical. Mutant insects and religious zealots are the chief villains in ""The Mist"" and its hard to say whos uglier. Much nastier and less genteel than his best-known Stephen King adaptations (""The Shawshank Redemption"" ""The Green Mile"") Frank Darabonts screw-loose doomsday thriller works better as a gross-out B-movie than as a psychological portrait of mankind under siege marred by one-note characterizations and a tone that veers wildly between snarky and hysterical. The Darabont-King imprimatur and curiosity among the authors legions of fans should lure healthy crowds over Thanksgiving weekend though long-term B.O. prospects look foggier. Ancillary should make up any shortfall. Six years after the lavish critical and commercial failure of ""The Majestic"" writer-director Darabont has returned with a vengeance to the horror genre (his scripting credits include such 80s titles as ""The Fly II"" and ""The Blob"") with this comparatively lean mean apocalyptic scarefest. The basic premise of Kings 1980 novella -- a malevolent fog descends on a small town trapping several residents inside a supermarket -- has been given a shot of docu-style immediacy from the darting handheld camerawork by Rohn Schmidt (FXs ""The Shield"" an episode of which Darabont directed) and its grotesque monsters have been impressively realized thanks to a well-stocked arsenal of special visual and creature effects. But Darabonts desire to infuse an otherwise fleet genre exercise with dramatic significance -- to make a statement about mans cruelty to man in times of crisis -- ends up defeating him here. Playing like the schizoid hellspawn of Steven Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" and the low-budget bioterrorism thriller ""Right at Your Door"" pic is arguably less persuasive than either in advancing a bitterly pessimistic view of human nature. After a freak storm damages their lakeside home in western Maine illustrator David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (9-year-old Nathan Gamble) head to the grocery store to stock up on food and supplies. But then the mist rolls in and while its not clear what it is (or worse what it might be concealing) most of the shoppers have the good sense to stay inside especially as those who go out tend not to return in one piece. Several nasty shocks later -- courtesy of a slimy many-tentacled behemoth and giant winged vaguely prehistoric-looking bugs that smash their way into the store -- a supermarket employee announces with priceless understatement ""It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude."" And as fear desperation and factionalism set in among the refugees ""The Mist"" raises the inevitable question of who the real monsters are. For that title its hard to beat Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) a religious extremist who whips up the crowd with her fire-and-brimstone denunciations and shrieks ""Now do you believe?"" after every fresh catastrophe. Her wild eyes ablaze Harden makes this awful stereotype awfully entertaining mustering up enough fervor to nearly sell the films hideous vision of men and women calling out for blood sacrifices to appease a wrathful God. As played by Jane the kind reasonable ever-resourceful David is impossible not to root for (hes a hunky man of action and a sensitive artist) and more often than not those characters foolish enough to scorn our heros advice are promptly and gruesomely punished. Bumping off the clueless is a time-honored horror tradition; so too is the bad-omen makeout scene (enacted here by attractive younguns Alexa Davalos and Sam Witwer). Cliches aside Darabont proves very much in his element during the pics harrowing midsection unleashing large-scale chaos on production designer Greg Meltons expertly detailed supermarket set and generating unpretentious thrills and laughs along the way. But the film cant sustain this momentum en route to a highly calculated ending that departs from Kings more ambiguous denouement to mostly shrug-worthy effect. While most of the supporting cast is hobbled by dialogue of the ""Id rather die out there trying than in here waiting"" variety Brit thesp Toby Jones and vet Frances Sternhagen do strong character work as sensible salt-of-the-earth types. Creepy-crawly creature effects some of which owe an obvious debt to ""Alien"" are squirmingly apt. At just over two hours ""The Mist"" is longish for a novella-based thriller but short compared to Darabonts previous pics.
