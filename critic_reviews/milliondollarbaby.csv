It was ""nearly flawless"" ""a breathtaking human drama"" ""the cinematic equivalent of Hemingway."" This consensus was challenged by only a few scattered naysayers who described the film as ""celluloid hooey"" ""phony simplistic and cheap"" and ""a compendium of every cliche from every bad boxing movie ever made."" The maddening thing about Million Dollar Baby is this Both sets of critics were right. The movie is simultaneously conventional and subversive broad and nuanced shamelessly manipulative and genuinely moving a cheap sucker punch and a work of real moral weight. By chance or design Eastwood produced a true rarity a hackneyed masterpiece. Released on video today Million Dollar Baby spends its first 90 minutes telling that most familiar of boxing stories about the scrappy down-and-out young fighter who with nothing but heart and the help of a crusty trainer rises all the way to a title bout for the world championship. The films quirk and its not a terribly imaginative one is that the boxer is a woman. (Now a movie about a fighter who was well-to-do that would be an interesting deparature.) Maggie Fitgerald (Hilary Swank) is a 31-year-old waitress from the Missouri Ozarks who shows up in the L.A. gym of former ""cut man"" and part-time trainer/manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and essentially refuses to leave until he agrees to train her. He holds out for a while offering one or another gruff variation on the theme ""I dont train girls."" But eventually he gives in moved by her obvious spunk and by gentle prodding from his avuncular blind-in-one-eye janitor ""Scrap"" (Morgan Freeman). Within a year Maggie has learned foot- and fist-work has honed her body to a lethal leanness and has begun winning pro bouts most of them by knockout. Eighteen months into her partnership with Frankie she is fighting for the WBA welterweight title of the world and she has her opponent on the ropes. It is at this point when most movies would be cuing up the confetti tears of joy and celebratory anthem that Million Dollar Baby offers its big twist. (Those who have somehow managed not to learn what it is and hope to retain that innocence should stop reading now.) Maggie does not win the fight but is instead sucker-punched from behind and crumples to the canvas. When she awakes she is paralyzed from the neck down with no hope of recovery. In time she loses a leg to gangrene; not long after that she loses the will to live. She asks Frankie to help her die and ultimately he does. This is not needless to say how most movies about plucky underdogs fighting long odds choose to end. Yet unconventional as it may seem at first glance Million Dollar Baby is to a considerable degree a stitching together of two familiar cinematic types the triumphal sports movie and the incurable illness tearjerker. The first of these in particular is told with a conventionality bordering on mass plagiarism. Eastwood plays the Burgess Meredith role of lovable cuss; Swank offers a grittier version of her girl-who-wont-give-up performance in 1994s The Next Karate Kid (imagine the odds you couldve gotten on her being a two-time Best Actress winner back then); and Morgan Freeman plays the Morgan Freeman character--which is to say a kindly self-effacing old black man with reserves of quiet wisdom and a wonderful aptitude for voiceover. The themes are so neat and obvious they could form the basis of a screenwriting syllabus Frankie has an estranged daughter who returns his letters unopened; Maggie lost her father at an early age. Inevitably he is soon telling her ""Youre a good daughter"" while she says ""You remind me of my father."" Nor is Frankies guilt limited to the mysterious transgression (we never learn what it was) that cost him his daughter. Years back Scrap was a fighter and Frankie was with him during the bout in which he lost sight in his eye. Frankie still blames himself for not stopping the fight and is now overprotective of all his fighters especially Maggie. Scraps narration too is littered with heavy-handed metaphors. Twice he describes wounds ""too close to the bone"" to stop the bleeding the first time referring to a lacerated cheekbone; the second to Frankies relationship with his daughter. A grotesque white-trash family is supplied for Maggie so that we can eventually enjoy watching her tell them off; an innocent imbecile named ""Danger"" is provided for the gym so that we can have the pleasure of seeing Scrap defend him by (rather implausibly) knocking out the twentysomething prizefighter who picked on him. Perhaps most frustratingly the crucial twist when Maggie is paralyzed is staged like something out of a comic book. Her injury isnt the result of an accident or a clean blow or any of the other common dangers that arise when two people are asked to punch one another in the face repeatedly. No its the result of an Evil Act by an Evil Person. Maggies opponent Billie the Blue Bear is a ""former prostitute from East Berlin [with] a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks."" (Those of you who thought that after Rocky IV wed seen the last of killer commies in the ring think again.) Judging from the excerpts we see of two of Billies bouts her boxing strategy seems to consist exclusively of elbowing her opponents in the face throwing them to the canvas by their necks and then punching them in the head while theyre still on the ground. The idea that a fighter this dirty would be allowed to participate in sanctioned boxing (scratch that womens boxing) let alone could be world champion is ridiculous. The blow that paralyzes Maggie is of course a shot from behind that takes place at least ten seconds after the bell has rung. Its almost a surprise that the script didnt allow Billie to bring a tire iron into the ring. Million Dollar Baby in other words ought to be a cheap exercise in audience manipulation. But its not--or rather its not only that. For all its cliches and hamfisted metaphors and overwrought melodrama there is a grim magnificence to the film a seriousness of purpose that elevates it not only above the schlock it might easily have been but into the upper tiers of recent American film. In large part this is a victory of execution over conception. Eastwood tells the story so well and draws such committed performances from his co-stars that theres little opportunity to snicker at the innate silliness. Morgan Freeman may be the best voiceover artist alive his world-weary humanism perfectly modulated to the tone of this film. In his mouth even the tritest most overwritten analogy feels grounded in experience. Along with a haunting minimalist piano score (composed by Eastwood himself) Freemans wistful narration ties together Million Dollar Babys heroic and tragic phases and offers the first signal that it will not be a typical sports movie. Hilary Swank too is doing what she does better than anyone narrow though it may be playing as she did in Boys Dont Cry a poor rural girl who fulfills her desire for self-determination by acting like a boy. Its no coincidence that Swank has been exceptional in both roles--nor that she has had less success playing more stereotypically feminine characters. She frequently seems a little uncomfortable and out of place onscreen a tendency that has interfered with some performances but has deepened others. Her face meanwhile with its strong jaw and outsized features is simultaneously indomitable and wide open to whatever injuries the world might offer. Eastwoods performance while not quite up to Freemans and Swanks is nonetheless powerful. For 40 years he has made an asset of his guardedness constructing (and on occasion subverting) an icon out of his terse manner and implacable looks. As Frankie he plays a character who has a reason (even if we never know exactly what it is) for keeping his distance and Eastwood handles the gradual erosion of that distance with subtlety. When it finally collapses altogether one can almost imagine that it is Eastwood not Frankie who has at last let down his guard completely. The star of Million Dollar Baby however is not Eastwood-the-actor but Eastwood-the-director who in his mid-seventies has rather unexpectedly emerged as one of the most serious filmmakers in Hollywood. One can see in the movie many of Eastwoods own virtues It is lean stoic and deliberate frugal with its emotions but not uncaring. Throughout the good the bad and the unthinkable its characters endure allowing themselves little in the way of either celebration or self-pity. For decades Eastwood has been one of the few American actors who frequently forswears a romantic interest in his films and this amorous reticence suffuses Million Dollar Baby. Not a single character in the film is attached or appears to hold out hope of ever being so. (Even the members of Maggies repulsive family are all single.) Its as if romantic love has been banished from the world leaving behind only the bonds of friendship which are themselves portrayed as almost too complicated to sustain. Increasingly it seems that there is very little middle ground in American motion pictures between the extremes of cynical nihilism and fatuous uplift as if filmmaking were a line with say Quentin Tarantino at one end and Ron Howard at the other. Million Dollar Baby escapes that continuum altogether however. It is an utterly sincere and earnest work but one devoid of all the usual reassuring bromides. Not only is there no cure for Maggie there is no redemption for Frankie no comfort to be found in other friendships or solace in the knowledge that he has done the right thing. It is on this last point that many of the political broadsides against the films ""pro-euthanasia"" message seem to me to rather miss the mark. Yes Frankie honors Maggies wish to die and yes this is presented as the ""right"" thing to do--insofar as such a thing could possibly exist under the circumstances. But like everything else in the film it comes with a steep price. Like Will Munney in Unforgiven Frankie does what he does in the full knowledge that it will cost him his soul and that afterwards he will never be able to rejoin moral society. (As Ive written elsewhere its ironic that Unforgiven has been read as anti-vigilantism and Million Dollar Baby as pro-euthanasia even though the two follow a nearly identical arc.) Million Dollar Baby may not have been the best film of last year. (For my money that would have been this or this.) But for all its faults it is a mature and serious film by a director belatedly coming into his full powers a reminder that even in Hollywood there is an alternative to empty irony and sentimental hackery. The Home Movies List Fistful of Eastwood The Good the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The final film of Sergio Leones ""Dollars"" trilogy features a picaresque adventure in the foreground and a biting indictment of war in general--and the American Civil War in particular--as backdrop. Much of the latter was cut out of the English language release but restored (somewhat unevenly) in a special edition DVD released last year. Magnum Force (1973). Eastwoods transformation from conservative hero to conservative bugaboo is usually traced to his revisionist western Unforgiven. But arguably he never subverted his iconic vigilante persona more aggressively than in this first Dirty Harry sequel in which his Inspector Callahan takes on rogue cops in his own department. Unforgiven (1992). Not as good as its reputation but Eastwoods most ambitious directorial effort up to that point (though remarkably it was already his sixteenth stint behind the lens with nine more since). A Perfect World (1993). Half-perfect. Kevin Costner does the best work of his career as an escaped convict driving across Texas with an only partly unwilling young hostage. But the parallel storyline featuring Eastwood and Laura Dern as two of the law enforcement agents chasing them is strained and tedious. Mystic River (2003). Eastwood-the-star sat this one out but Eastwood-the-director managed a near-masterpiece that was undermined by Tim Robbinss lame performance in a still lamer role as lunatic-cum-plot-device.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote there are no second acts in American lives. Somebody forgot to tell Clint Eastwood who at 74 and well into his third act is doing the best most assured work of his career. And hes doing it in his usual quick thrifty no-fuss manner. A year after the dark epic ""Mystic River"" he weighs in with ""Million Dollar Baby"" set in the nether regions of the boxing world. The focus is tighter more intimate Eastwood plays a guarded solitary gym owner and fight manager in Los Angeles who reluctantly agrees to train 31-year-old Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) an Arkansas redneck who has nothing in her life but her fierce determination to fight.This is a setting and a setup that comes booby-trapped with fight-movie cliches stretching from ""Girlfight"" and ""Rocky"" back to the 30s. This is not however Eastwood taking one of his genre-movie breathers; it may be a smaller movie than ""Mystic River"" but its every bit as uncompromising and even more powerful. Think you know where this story is headed? You dont and Ill do you the favor of not telling. Lets just say that just when you think youve got its number ""Million Dollar Baby"" blindsides you with a devastating hook.As an actor Eastwood has rarely taken on a character as complex as Frankie Dunn a gruff guilt-ridden Roman Catholic who attends mass every day driving his priest crazy with his incessant irreverent questions. Frankie broods over the estranged daughter he drove away years earlier. His only confidant is Scrap (Morgan Freeman) a battle-scarred former fighter who looks after the Hit Pit Frankies old-style gym. Frankie studies Gaelic reads Yeats and doesnt like to take chances. Hed rather hold his fighters back from taking a title shot if theres a risk they might get hurt and he pays for it when his charges inevitably abandon him for greener pastures. No one has lured him out of his shell until Maggie comes along and its obvious the love that grows between them is the love he couldnt give his daughter. In front of the camera Eastwoods often coasted on his iconic persona; here he inhabits his character completely. Playing a prickly haunted man who always keeps his guard up Eastwood gives his most daring emotional unguarded performance. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Swank who was extraordinary in ""Boys Dont Cry"" hasnt fared so well in conventional leading-lady roles where she tends to disappear. Extremity becomes her. As Maggie she pops off the screen funny touching and ferociously physical. Swank makes us feel the exhilaration that courses through Maggies lithe body once she learns proper boxing technique and unleashes the knockout blows that send her opponents crashing to the canvas. Her body language shouts.The well-observed details of the fight world come courtesy of F. X. Toole whose story in ""Rope Burns"" is the basis of Paul Haggiss screenplay. Haggis has done a terrific job of remaining faithful to the text while fleshing out the characters. Freemans Scrap who narrates the story (OK maybe theres a little more voice-over than is necessary) doesnt exist in Tooles short story. Hes a savvy addition giving Frankie a sounding board--and Freeman a wonderful role. Margo Martindale is brilliantly loathsome as Maggies white-trash mom a woman of chilling selfishness.""Million Dollar Baby"" could have been sentimental or quaint but Haggis and Eastwood are made of sterner stuff. In his clean unhurried unblinking fashion Eastwood takes the audience to raw profoundly moving places. If you fear strong emotions this is not for you. But if you want to see Hollywood filmmaking at its most potent Eastwood has delivered the real deal.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby Slate Sign In Sign Up The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 17 2004 807 PM Wings of Desire Martin Scorsese joins the mile-high club in The Aviator. By David Edelstein After the (ongoing/endless) discussion in this column about the biopic and its discontents the genres problems can be neatly summarized Biopics hit their prescribed beats with metronomic predictability and often tin-eared dialogue; they use artistic license to the point of distorting the meaning of the lives they purport to interpret (see Beautiful Mind A); and theyre generally too choppy too spread out or too fatuously tied-up in neat little Freudian packages to have any sustained dramatic impact. Which bring us to Martin Scorseses The Aviator (Miramax) which flirts with just about every biopic infelicity Ive cited above and then waltzes away unsullied. I dont know what the movie adds up to It neither celebrates nor ridicules its subject and its analysis doesnt cut especially deep. In retrospect its weakest moments are its least typical the opening tableau--Hughes as a naked boy being bathed (standing up) by his mother who warns him that the world is a dirty plague-ridden place and then teaches him to spell ""quarantine""--and its protagonists vision in a moment of high emotion of himself as a shivering old man. In other words it falters when it departs from its buoyant one-thing-after-another tempo and tries to interpret Hughes encroaching madness. The rest of the time The Aviator is seductively noncommittal--three hours long and a breeze. Advertisement Few biopics with this kind of crazy scope have ever been so seamless. Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) was a daring test pilot a hard-charging capitalist a film producer a romancer of gorgeous Hollywood actresses and an obsessive-compulsive germaphobe who finally succumbed to mental illness--ending up as an emaciated recluse running one terrible movie Ice Station Zebra over and over in his sterile lair. No one has ever made sense of the Ice Station Zebra thing but The Aviator connects the rest of the facets of Hughes character. Well I think it does; Id have to read John Logans screenplay to see if its all there. Whats clear from the movie is that Scorsese and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker are transition demons. Fluidity and momentum--hours in the editing room rubbing and buffing and tweaking and smoothing out--can make a lot of plot holes (and even a few chasms) seem negligible. My guess is that Scorsese was galvanized by the superb pacing (and nonjudgmental tone) of Steven Spielbergs Catch Me If You Can--which offered the rebuke of a wonderful DiCaprio performance while the actor was floundering on neighboring multiplex screens in Scorseses Gangs of New York. DiCaprio doesnt have much weight as an actor and he has no pipes to speak of; he doesnt have the size the life force that many of us associate with Hughes. But he has always made his lightness an asset bringing a certain spring-heeled unselfconscious suavity to everything he does while remaining likably vulnerable. (You cant always read that big fleshy Clintonesque face but you never tire of scrutinizing it.) In the early scenes the pacing is of the fast-talking keep-it-moving 30s newspaper variety with the occasional split-screen and intertitle adding spice. Its the best setting imaginable for young Leo. Logan and Scorsese have a brilliant idea for the movies first section It revolves around Hughes freshly in control of his familys Texas finances siphoning his inheritanceinto the aviation adventure Hells Angels. He hires an accountant (John C. Reilly) to manage his funds and a somewhat confused meteorology professor (Ian Holm) to help him find the right cumulus clouds to give the dogfights scale and contrast. He pores over his footage in the editing room struggling to give the movie form--and in the process underscoring Scorsese and Logan and Schoonmakers task finding a thread in a life that was first about fearlessness and motion and then about terror and stasis. Both sides are in play from the start. The filmmakers dazzle you with aerial sequences (obviously computer-enhanced but designed with such old-fashioned brio that you dont care) with Hughes defying death at speeds and in planes that had never been tested and then they top them with scenes in which he cant pass a towel to a man in a mens room or bring himself to turn a germ-laden doorknob. Hughes brings all his life force to bear in taking on PanAms Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin in another peerless bullying fat-cat performance--how much more fun he is now that hes no longer a leading man) and Trippes Senate stooge Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda in a mesmerizing depiction of an immaculately poised and tailored establishment sleazebag). Then the uber-capitalist seizes on a phrase--a paean to the future--and cant stop repeating it finally locking himself in a room for months. You dont know where visionary American enterprise ends and American lunacy begins. Advertisement Scorseses need to be seen as a Great Director distended parts of Gangs of New York but here the style is subordinate to the story. Its almost as if he allowed himself this time to pick up DiCaprios vibes. The actor is a real charmer. He fixes his wide-set blue eyes on a cigarette girl (comer Gwen Stefani) furrows his brow and says softly ""See I wonder what gives a beautiful woman like you pleasure."" Obvious--but coming from a DiCaprio (or a Hughes) devastating. Hughes turns that cigarette girl into Jean Harlow and whenever The Aviator needs a jolt of sex or comedy theres another beautiful woman on Hughes arm. I was never convinced by Kate Beckinsales Ava Gardner In real life the actress was apparently a regular ol good-time gal in the body of a goddess but Beckinsale however goddessy is anything but a good-time gal and her earthy interjections just seem weird. But Cate Blanchett ... ahhhh. She doesnt impersonate Katharine Hepburn; she channels her. She crystallizes something Ive never quite realized that Hepburn was at once jaunty--WASPily nonchalant--and at the same time monstrously high-strung. Scorsese and Logan underline Hughes discomfort with bluebloods in a priceless dinner-table scene at the Yankee Hepburn estate a display of verbal slapstick presided over by Frances Conroy as Hepburns truculently liberal and incorrigibly patronizing mother. When you watch Blanchett plant her nose in the air throw back her red curls and come out with that insouciant falsetto braying laugh from The Philadelphia Story you know exactly where it came from. The whole performance is pitched at that level. Its a delightful circus turn one of many spinning balls that Scorsese keeps in the air. (See a correction to this post at the bottom of the page here.) ... 507 p.m. Wednesday Dec. 15 2004 Punch Drunk In Clint Eastwoods Million Dollar Baby(Warner Bros.) Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn an aging boxing trainer whos known as the ""best cutter"" in the business--he can relieve the pressure patch his fighters up and send them back into the ring for more punishment. But Frankie is a tortured man. He has premonitions of doom perhaps the result of letting one-time boxer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) stay in the ring too long with dire results Eddie lost an eye and now hes manager/janitor of Frankies rundown gym. Eddie is also the films narrator making pronouncements like ""Boxing is about respect--getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy."" Advertisement Frankie protects his fighters to the point of jeopardizing their careers holding them back from title bouts out of a (largely unexamined) fear for their safety. The upshot is that his best fighters are snatched away by more ambitious promoters--which leaves him more or less available when the dirt-poor but plucky Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up and begs to be trained. But surly Frankie wants no part of womens boxing. When she proclaims her toughness he rasps ""Girly tough aint enough."" But plucky Maggie keeps plucking--training night and day (in between shifts at her minimum-wage waitress job) peppering Frankie with questions calling him ""Boss."" Finally struck by her pluck he relents and after the requisite training montage Maggie starts to win big--generally with first-round knockouts. She charges onto the canvas shining-eyed lit from within and lays her opponents flat. But Frankie characteristically wont let her go for the title. He has a gut feeling about his fighters destinies. Heralded as a masterpiece by critics who consider Eastwood the greatest living American director Million Dollar Baby is an exercise in obviousness. Its hard to exaggerate the crudity of this film at least on a narrative level. (The screenplay is by Paul Haggis and is loosely based on stories by the late F.X. Toole.) If anyone but Eastwood--with his macho icon status and soft-pedal delivery (theres almost nothing left of the actors vocal cords)--were to utter a line like ""Girly tough aint enough"" it would bring down the house. And if anyone but Morgan Freeman--so centered watchful canny--had played the sagacious Eddie who finally takes over from a weirdly belligerent priest (Brian OByrne) as Frankies spiritual adviser the old-fashioned banality of the part would have flashed like a neon sign. At two points in the film Maggies family--her fat bedraggled momma single-mother sister and ex-con brother--show up and ""trailer-trash"" would be too subtle a designation Eastwood practically superimposes dollar signs over their eyes. Hilary Swank is totally phony--but thats not in context such a bad thing. She throws herself into the part supplying energy and heart and shes wiry enough to bring off her fight scenes without an imposing physique. But the role is grotesquely sentimental its gee-whiz optimism (and saintly subservience) at odds with the characters drive to pummel other women in the ring. Im not saying the impulses couldnt coexist Its an irony that might have been mined. But it would take a brainier actress than Swank and a director open to exploring his characters (or at least rehearsing his performers). Eastwood has suffused Million Dollar Baby with his usual gloom--with little sunlight and with characters who are frequently discovered heads bowed in pools of light amid the oppressive darkness. His is a remarkably consistent vision and images from the movie--especially the images of the anguished irresolute Eastwood himself--might return to haunt you. The sudden swerve into catastrophic territory is no less heavy-handed than the rest of the movie (its more heavy-handed) but youre not prepared--even with the air of fatalism--for the jump from one shameless genre to another. Its impressive in the sense that a sucker-punch impresses itself on your skull. Advertisement Its hard not to gush about the latest Zhang Yimou picture House of Flying Daggers (Sony Pictures Classics). No its impossible. This is the most intoxicatingly beautiful martial arts picture Ive ever seen--and if you think thats damning with faint praise you missed Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Zhangs own Hero as well as such deliriously surreal supernatural Hong Kong fare as A Chinese GhostStory The Bride With White Hair and Tsui Harks Green Snake. Hero was splendid--arguably the more interesting movie--but a little solemn for my taste with a stoic protagonist more self-consciously edited fight scenes and a greater emphasis on formal tableaux. Daggers is simply a sword-and-dagger extravaganza with some wonderfully florid romantic melodrama The big fighting sequences bloom out of the characters passions the way song and dance numbers do in classic musicals. Its set in the year 859 in an age of corrupt government and a secret rebel sect called the House of Flying Daggers. The plot is too convoluted--and too full of surprises--to recount here It involves a blind rebel played by Zhang Ziyi (of Crouching Tiger) and two policemen played by Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau (the police-department mole in Infernal Affairs). The men are ordered to use the young woman to get to the HOFD leader--but no one is what he or she seems to be and what seems like a straightforward chase picture becomes a knotty love triangle with twists and hairpin emotional curves. It would be just an ooh-and-ahh movie--every shot a painting like Zhangs earlier films and something like Days of Heaven--but the martial arts takes it into another dimension. Zhang has a wowza visual concept for each battle His camera soars behind arrows and flying daggers which boomerang and bounce off shields and deftly slice peoples throats. One sequence will be talked about for years the battle in the green bamboo forest the assassins gliding silently down from trees the fighting on the ground in branches in midair Holy bamboo Batman Its furious yet so miraculously fluid--and so elegant. Zhang sets the bar so high I dont know how anyone could top him without redesigning the human body and even then youd need his genius for color and composition. Unlike Hero House of Flying Daggers doesnt bear much thought. You just have to revel in it. ...1247 p.m. There werent too many responses to my latest biopic challenge perhaps for two reasons 1) People remember movies but not lines of dialogue; and 2) no one wanted to go back and watch these rotten pictures to write the bad lines down. It might also be that the prizes--The Making of Alexander (first place) and De-Lovely Behind the Creation of the MGM Motion Picture (second place)--were not much of an incentive. As Michael Fallon points out the third-place winner should get both books. Advertisement Based on the entries I can sort the typical bad biopic lines into three groups 1) Clunky attempts by screenwriters to find a middle ground between period and modern diction often exacerbated by miscast stars.2) The absurdity of the quotidian in the mouths of illustrious personages--i.e. small talk from larger-than-life people.3) The need to further the biopic agenda to frame the central issues of the subjects life and to put his or her trials in historical context. Its No. 3 that I think is the most instructive and its perfectly encapsulated by the line from Beyond the Sea that triggered this exercise ""While it looked like Bobby Kennedy might heal the country Sandy and I drifted farther and farther apart."" Thats a classic genre howler--one that should be taught (as a counter-example) in film schools. But our winning entry tops it by a wide margin. I have chosen not to name the screenwriters because in spite of what you might think I am a merciful man. A disclaimer I have not fact-checked a single one of these lines. For the sake of the historical record feel free to send corrections. First prize of The Making of Alexander goes to Arthur Tiersky for this jaw-dropping monologue from the stinko John Belushi biopic Wired John theres a light within you. I want you to burn it out. BURN IT OUT BURN IT OUT In Vietnam monks set themselves on fire. Artaud. Artaud said that actors should perform like they are on fire. Signaling through the flames ... THATS our job as comedians To burn brightly and stand as a symbol. I will not give in to this consensus reality Cut the demons loose John Let em loose Thats were your characters come from. Second prize was not as easy to determine. It goes to Bret Thompson and its Lee Krasners assessment of the painters latest canvas in Pollack ""Youve done it this time Pollack. Youve broken it wide open."" A close runner-up (via Dan J. Vice also cited in my Slate review) was the tribute of agent George Shapiro to his client Andy Kaufman in Man in the Moon ""Youre insane--but you might also be brilliant."" Also consider this via Kevin Dafler from the Richie Valens biopic La Bamba ""Im going to be a star and stars dont fall from the sky do they?"" Category 2 offered some doozies the chercest from Nicholas and Alexandra via Paul Notley TROTSKY Youve been avoiding me Lenin. From the same movie James Hynes remembers a Lenin line that went something like ""Nice work on the manifesto Trotsky."" A potential winner if the quotation had been exact Another good Category 2 exchange is this from The Greatest Story Ever Told via Paul Hynes URIAH (Sal Mineo hobbling on a crutch and trying to keep up with Jesus Max von Sydow striding forcefully toward his destiny in Jerusalem) Master Master What is your name?JESUS People call me Jesus .... I recall Dwight MacDonald having fun with the same movie and quoting a line that went something like ""Ive heard many things about you Baptist--all bad."" Lane Buckman offers this question posed to Joan of Arc by a character called ""The Conscience"" (Dustin Hoffman) in the awful The Messenger ""When did this become painful for you?"" Andrew Dardine remembers the title characters dying line in The Great Ziegfeld ""More stairs More stairs"" And lets not forget this gem sent by John Persinos from the Genghis Khan biopic The Conqueror uttered by John Waynes Mongol leader as he contemplates Susan Hayward ""There are moments for action then I listen to my blood. I feel this Tatar woman is for me. My blood says take her"" Finally via winner Arthur Tiersky and also Perry Seibert comes a line from Max the risible portrait of the young Hitler as a second-rate artist. Its so bizarre that it must be a joke but even as a joke its ... words fail me. ""Come on Hitler Ill buy you a glass of lemonade."" ... 930 a.m. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 3 4 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Like that eight-engine behemoth this account of Hughess life is spruced up (his craziness sanitized to make him sympathetic) goosed up (with flashy techniques the director favors) wooden-winged (though the thing flies it doesnt soar) and remarkable to behold as it goes by. (The production was designed by Dante Ferretti and photographed by Robert Richardson.) Watching the actors and gorgeous trappings is an adventure in cognitive dissonance. I didnt believe a single minute in almost three hours but enjoyed being there all the same. Enjoyment and disbelief coexist quite happily in the razzle-dazzle of the early reels. Mr. Scorsese has brought his love of old-fashioned Hollywood pageantry to a big newish-fashioned saga of a thwarted visionary. (Its his version of Francis Coppolas ""Tucker The Man and His Dream."") Howard Hughes produced and directed movies starting at the age of 22 so movie love provides the director of ""The Aviator"" and its writer John Logan with a perfect access route to Hughess varied and storied career. But movie love in this case also means a production more concerned with theatricality than with realism or biographical truth. When we first see Mr. DiCaprios Howard Hughes as a baby-faced adult the year is 1927 and hes directing his first film the extravagant aviation epic ""Hells Angels."" (Though the re-creation is terrific fun no time is taken to suggest how the son of a Texas drill-bit tycoon learned to direct or to note that other directors worked on the film.) Next Howard is at the premiere with flash bulbs exploding like grenades pow pow pow and a bizarre Jean Harlow lookunalike at his side. Then Howards life goes pow pow pow He falls for Cate Blanchetts Katharine Hepburn (Who wouldnt?) He teaches Kate how to fly (Beautiful sequence.) He buys TWA (The guys a gambler.) He breaks the worlds speed record then walks away from a crash landing in a beet field (""Fastest man on earth"" Hughes tells Hepburn when he gets home tapping himself boyishly -- and charmingly -- on the chest.) This romantic interlude gives ""The Aviator"" a counterpart of the uplift that Hughes would later engineer quite literally into Jane Russells bra. (She was his ultrabuxom star in ""The Outlaw."") Ms. Blanchetts portrayal isnt just an astonishing soundalike -- she seems to have internalized all the rhythms as well as the timbre of Hepburns voice -- but an enchanting creation in its own right. Mr. DiCaprios initial jauntiness is entertaining too. His Howard comes on as a Gatsby with the gift of blunt gab and the passion of an Icarus for risky flight. Yet a paradox shadows both performances. Cate Blanchett does whats asked of her wonderfully well but its still a trick just like Jude Laws fleeting turn as Errol Flynn or Kate Beckinsales game impersonation of Ava Gardner. (Game but pallid beneath Avas sensational clothes.) Leonardo DiCaprio brings an impressive set of skills to his role but theyre the wrong skills because hes wrong for the part. While he comes to look like the real-life Hughes as his character ages he remains unconvincing as a man tortured by brain disease. Its as if the brilliant imposter Mr. DiCaprio played in ""Catch Me if You Can"" had somehow snagged this part and was going through the motions cleverly even though the full range of the heros emotions was beyond him. And beyond or apart from the movies intentions. ""The Aviator"" bites off only a slice of Hughess story choosing to avoid his unsavory sex life and crackpot politics and ending before his move to Las Vegas where he descended into the depths of solitary madness. Thats fair enough As Hepburn says here ""Movies are movies Howard not life."" Martin Scorseses movie gives us plenty to munch on elegant airplanes; a shattering crash; zestful music; Alec Baldwins smooth take on Pan Americans Juan Trippe; Alan Aldas unctuous unprincipled Owen Brewster the senator who went after Hughes on Trippes behalf when TWA tried to break Pan Ams stranglehold on international routes. Still movies try to simulate life or heighten it and this one succeeds only partly. Its hero may be a visionary but he also displays alarming behaviors and no one really talks about them; theyre just for display. His career in aviation lacks context World War II comes and goes with hardly a mention. His insanity lacks scale the spectacle is intriguing rather than commanding. In the Pixar extravaganza ""The Incredibles"" the tiny costume designer Edna Mode a takeoff on Hollywoods legendary Edith Head laments ""I used to design for gods"" In ""The Aviator"" the stars playing gods -- and monsters -- seem all too mortal. Million Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood directed ""Million Dollar Baby."" Its a boxing film in which he plays a world-weary trainer Frankie Dunn who reluctantly takes on a female fighter played by Hilary Swank. Shes very strong in her role dramatically and physically while his performance reminded me of something Art Carney said a long time ago about his stirring work in ""The Late Show."" All he tried to do in the role Carney told me was be ""correct."" An old-fashioned notion and a fine one it epitomizes Mr. Eastwoods work here -- nothing showy nothing disproportionate. You cant even call his acting minimalist since that would suggest artfulness. Its sufficientist -- just enough to give us privileged glimpses of Frankies good guilt-ridden soul. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a mood piece punctuated by powerful action with a plot turn I wont discuss except to say that only a star of Clint Eastwoods stature could have gotten a major studio to go along with the storys resolution which is nothing if not forthright. For a while the dominant mood is muted melancholy. Though the world has passed Frankie by hes found refuge in a neighborhood gym which he owns and a cherished friend in Morgan Freemans Scrap an ex-boxer whos no stranger to the source of Frankies guilt. Then Ms. Swanks Maggie Fitzgerald comes in off the street to change everyones life -- an earnest desperate refugee from Ozark poverty who thinks she can succeed in the professional ring even though shes no longer young provided someone is willing to teach her and believe in her. The movie which was adapted by Paul Haggis from the ""Rope Burns"" stories of F.X. Toole is also a love story -- Maggie takes the place of Frankies estranged daughter. If some of this sounds predictable or pat its because ""Million Dollar Baby"" constitutes in form if not always in substance a thoroughly conventional drama. It isnt the epic event being hailed by admirers who insist as they did last year with ""Mystic River"" on elevating Mr. Eastwoods directorial style from conventional to classical. I say this because his new movie for which he wrote the graceful score should be appreciated for what it is not overpraised and then seen as a disappointment. It is thoughtful unfashionable measured mostly honest sometimes clumsy or remote often exciting occasionally moving and eventually surprising. Its correct. The Sea Inside God bless great actors and great acting. Javier Bardem shows how its done in ""The Sea Inside"" a Spanish-language feature directed by Alejandro Amenabar about Ramon Sampedro a quadriplegic who was the first person in Spain to request that his life be ended by euthanasia. (His wish was granted after a 30-year campaign.) One could argue that Mr. Bardem showed us everything about acting we could have wanted to know when he played the Cuban poet and novelist Reynaldo Arenas in ""Before Night Falls."" But ""The Sea Inside"" is different since this time he can only act from the neck up. And so he does to the point of updating half of an old theatrical joke that had John Gielgud as the worlds best actor from the neck up and Laurence Olivier from the neck down. Thats not to make light of the heros plight though one of the movies many strengths is his self-ironic humor. Paralyzed as the result of a diving accident Ramon can move only his head and move those around him with his voice. Mr. Bardems handsome face changed substantially but not essentially by excellent older-age makeup is partly buried in his neck while his normally rich robust voice is reduced to a soft but urgent flow of language that can be lilting rueful lyrical or ferocious. And those around him are both moved and moving an ardent village woman played superbly by Lola Duenas a disabled-rights lawyer with her own rather contrived disability played by Belen Rueda (whose beauty mustnt be held against her; she gives a marvelous performance in what is remarkably her feature-film debut.) ""The Sea Inside"" has its share of contrivances some more successful than others but center stage is occupied by truth and austere beauty. Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events One problem with ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events"" stems from an unfortunate phenomenon that kids understand very well. Grownups have a habit of going on too long. Jim Carrey is the prime offender here. Hes such an unseemly showoff that the movie keeps stopping in its tracks. But how and why should kids be expected to understand that their beloved Daniel Handler books have been damaged by gratuitous darkness a damage that cant be undone by design? Rich Heinrichss production design is endlessly inventive a retro vision of Jules Verne via Terry Gilliam but who was this glum movie made for? Surely not young children in search of cheerful fun. Spanglish In ""Spanglish"" a social comedy by James L. Brooks a good story about culture clash and the immigrant experience lies buried beneath layers of Bel-Air blather and bilious bombast. Paz Vega is Flor a beautiful Mexican mother innocent of English who with her beautiful gifted daughter enters California illegally and finds work keeping house for a wealthy family. Adam Sandler plays the master of the house John Clasky a preposterously saintly wimp. Tea Leoni is Deborah Clasky his fiendishly narcissistic wife. Ive enjoyed Ms. Leonis comic gifts in the past and Ill enjoy them again but ""Spanglish"" asks her to play crazed and she delivers with a performance of unremitting crazymaking shrillness. In the tooth of Deborahs mouth storms all subtlety is blown away.    DVD TIP It is time once again to sing the praises of ""Melvin and Howard"" (1980) which Ive recommended before but not when Howard Hughes was the subject of a major movie. Jonathan Demmes delicate fantasy is a minor movie but deservedly a small classic. Paul Le Mat is Melvin Dummar a small-town goofball who comes upon Jason Robardss Howard Hughes a scruffy vagrant or so it would seem lying helpless in the desert. Once youve seen this poetic Howard all others are prosaic.

"At the Movies Million Dollar Baby 012605 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies Million Dollar Baby By David Germain| Associated Press Wednesday January 26 2005 Hilary Swank showed signs of becoming one of those actresses who wins an Academy Award then fades into a succession of forgettable roles. But with Clint Eastwoods splendid ""Million Dollar Baby"" she makes a comeback worthy of Muhammad Ali playing a woman hoping to rise above her hard-knock life by training as a boxer. Barely a year after the release of ""Mystic River"" Eastwood delivers a second consecutive drama that fearlessly probes the shadows of human morality without falling back on easy answers. Along with Swank who won a best-actress Oscar for ""Boys Dont Cry"" Eastwood is receiving serious awards consideration as both lead actor and director. The film itself should follow ""Mystic River"" as a best-picture contender and co-star Morgan Freeman belongs among the front-runners for supporting actor. Adapted from short stories by former boxing ""cut man"" F.X. Toole the screenplay by Paul Haggis crackles with tough-guy dialogue and insightful street wisdom. Eastwood plays lovably irascible gym owner and boxing trainer Frankie Dunn a guilt-ridden man with an estranged daughter and a host of personal sins for which he cannot find atonement despite attending Mass each morning. Frankies gym attracts hard-luck cases including ex-fighter Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Freeman) - Scrap for short - who makes an ascetic home in the gym back room and fills a variety of roles from cleaning toilets to mentoring up-and-coming athletes. After a fighter Frankie has groomed for a title shot jumps ship to another manager a new contender enters his life Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). A waitress with a harsh upbringing behind her and nothing but a lifetime of bad tips ahead Maggie turns to boxing the only thing she ever felt good doing. Frankie initially scorns her desire to fight saying the thirtysomething Maggie is too old to train and that competitive boxing among women is a fad the ""latest freak show out there."" Scrap takes pity on Maggie and tosses her some nuggets of advice. And gradually Frankie is sucked in too first by exacerbation over Maggies coarse boxing form later by her indomitable high spirits and tenacity which come packaged with a natural ability to punch opponents lights out. Maggies transition from clumsy combatant to potential champion is abrupt but easy enough to accept given the exuberance of the films second act when she and Frankie fall into a delightful surrogate father-daughter relationship and she becomes the darling of fight crowds. Just when it seems the film will wrap up as a satisfying ""Rocky""-like chick flick ""Million Dollar Baby"" turns deep and dark presenting a harsh ethical dilemma that coaxes potently raw performances from Eastwood and Swank. Eastwood and Freeman fall back into the same easy camaraderie they demonstrated in the directors dark Western ""Unforgiven."" Freemans voice-overs delivered with austere detachment serve as an emotional anchor and nicely complement the action. The score by Eastwood with orchestration by his longtime collaborator Lennie Niehaus provides a suitably forlorn musical backdrop reminiscent of the sparse tones of ""Unforgiven."" The closing image - in its equivocal tone at least - also harks back to the uncertain ending of that great Western. For the decade or so between ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"" Eastwood mostly made commonplace movies. At 74 Eastwood has hit a late-career stride. With nothing to prove to anyone hes willing to tackle ambivalent characters and bleak moral questions rarely seen in Hollywood films. ""Million Dollar Baby"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 for violence some disturbing images thematic material and language. Running time 132 minutes. Four stars out of four.

"Laid bare in the ring - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Million Dollar Baby (movie)MOVIE REVIEW Laid bare in the ringIn Million Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood delivers a lean emotionally daring tale set in the unforgiving world of boxing.December 15 2004|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer What can be said about Clint Eastwood that hasnt been said before?That hes American films last and best classicist a 74-year-old director whos aged better than a ""Sideways"" Pinot Noir? That his increasingly fearless and idiosyncratic choice of material has made him more of an independent filmmaker than half the people at Sundance? That he continues to find ways to surprise audiences yet remain inescapably himself? Its all true and never more so than in Eastwoods latest ""Million Dollar Baby.""Perhaps the directors most touching most elegiac work yet ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that does both the expected and the unexpected that has the nerve and the will to be as pitiless as it is sentimental. A tale of the power and cost of dreams set in the unforgiving world of professional boxing its got some of the emotional daring of the great melodramas of Hollywoods golden age when films considered it a badge of honor to wear their heart on their sleeve.""Million Dollar Baby"" also reconfirms what ""Mystic River"" and its Oscars for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins made clear that Eastwood despite his legendary no-nonsense style has become a gifted director of actors. Its not just the exceptional work by costars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman that stands out here its Eastwoods own performance in some ways the most nakedly emotional of his 50-year career.As with ""Mystic River"" Eastwood has started with commanding material a debut collection of short stories by the late F.X. Toole called ""Rope Burns"" which was published in 2000 when its author a trainer and licensed cut man for more than 20 years was 70 years old. A writer whose knowledge of boxing was matched by his lean skill with words Toole like Eastwood was a traditionalist who saw value in the old ways.Paul Haggis a writer with extensive television credits including creation of the acclaimed ""EZ Streets"" adroitly combined two of Tooles stories into the ""Million Dollar"" script using the narrator of one to tell the tale of the second and fleshing it all out with touches that rarely seem extraneous to the storys main drive.Eastwood who has perhaps the best eye in the business for the kinds of roles an aging star should be playing is Frankie Dunn a trainer and manager who owns a ramshackle gym in downtown L.A. all too appropriately named the Hit Pit.Cantankerous as well as querulous Frankie Dunn still manages a contender or two but his reluctance to push his top man for a title fight speaks to a sense of pulling back of disconnecting from life. He is painfully but apparently permanently estranged from his only child a daughter and he only goes to church to wind up the priest. Studying Gaelic is his sole pleasure and with a single exception ring rust has formed on his personal relationships.That exception would be his right-hand man Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Freeman) an unflappable blind-in-one-eye former boxer who has run the Hit Pit day-to-day for 17 years. Its Dupris extensive voice-over that gives us the context for the unfolding story garnished with home truths about boxing gleaned from Tooles stories.Eastwood and Freeman not only share similarly laid-back styles theyve worked together before in Eastwoods ""Unforgiven."" Seeing them trying to genially out-underact each other is one of ""Million Dollar Babys"" most satisfying pleasures; a scene in which they share a conversation about of all things socks is a master class in how understated acting can be used to magnificent effect.Into this hermetic world comes Maggie Fitzgerald a completely different type of person. A hardscrabble young woman well aware of her white trash background Maggie has focused her entire life on a single goal having Frankie Dunn mold her into the best fighter she can be. Boxing she says is ""the only thing I ever felt good doing"" and giving up on that feeling is out of the question.Both physically and psychologically Swank who put on 17 pounds of muscle during three months of boxing training inhabits this role as she has no other since ""Boys Dont Cry"" for which she won an Oscar. Her Maggie has a feral intensity that combines with a heartbreaking eagerness and a megawatt smile to devastating effect.

Hes dismissive of her chances for success in the plainest language he can find. Of course its a given especially with the looming possibility of a surrogate father-daughter relationship that Frankie will relent and take her on but rather than being the end of their story that is the merest beginning.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSelling her 9-million-dollar babyNovember 18 2012Million Dollar Baby Throws Sucker PunchMarch 13 2005On The Set  Hot 60-Year-Old Copy  THE STORY OF THE...November 20 1994MORE STORIES ABOUTMillion Dollar Baby (movie)Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/15/entertainment/et-million15,200,milliondollarbaby6,milliondollarbaby,latimes

But if thats so Frankies life outside the gym is so private that the only person likely to understand his aversion to risk-taking is Scraps (Morgan Freeman) an ex-boxer who helps run the place. Not that the boss often heeds his advice when Maggie (Hilary Swank) a po-white-trash waitress from the Ozarks turns up asking for tuition Scraps sees real talent but Frankie insists shes too inexperienced too old... and a woman. And Frankie dont train women. But this one wont take no for an answer. Dont please read or listen to anything that tells you more than the above; the only other thing you need know is that Eastwoods latest is a tremendous movie you should see even if you think boxing pictures arent for you. To be aware of more of the plot would almost certainly diminish your enjoyment of the movies storytelling skills not to mention its devastating emotional effect. This is Clint at his best giving a beautifully nuanced performance himself allowing Freeman and the rest of the cast enough time and space to fully inhabit their roles eliciting an Oscar-worthy performance from Swank and executing the whole thing with a classical grace clarity and integrity seldom seen in modern mainstream cinema. Far more restrained than the sometimes atypically overwrought Mystic River this displays the (deceptive) simplicity of a Bird (its exploration of complex ethical issues manages to be both forthright and subtle) the emotional richness and integrity of a Bridges of Madison County and the dramatic assurance and expertise of a Josey Wales. Quietly quite magnificent.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Actors are capable of sinking into many roles but icons like Clint Eastwood are another story His range is limited but within those limits his aura suggests a history and gravity thats more powerful than mere performance. In his beautiful boxing drama Million Dollar Baby Eastwood allows the gentle masculinity of his recent roles to seep into the entire movie creating a haunted tone that transforms an underdog sports film into something as intimate as a whisper. With its down-and-out characters and dramatic interplay of darkness and light the film has the texture of a somber palooka noir like Robert Wises The Set-Up but its touched by a dogged optimism thats anathema to the genre. Though conventional in many respects it feels like no other boxing film ever made due largely to Eastwoods unmistakable presence on both sides of the camera. Based on Rope Burns Stories From The Corner a short-story anthology by veteran fight manager and cutman Jerry Boyd (writing under the pen name F.X. Toole) Million Dollar Baby is suffused with loss since even the brightest boxing careers are short-lived and doomed to disappointment at the end of the line. As a longtime trainer and current proprietor of a dilapidated gym Eastwood knows this heartbreak better than most because hes reminded of it every day. His gym manager played by an assured Morgan Freeman was a great contender until a brutal title bout left him blind in one eye. Hesitant to train another fighter Eastwood reluctantly takes on Hilary Swank a trailer-park-raised waitress who overcomes her age and inexperience with raw talent and determination. Estranged from their respective families Eastwood and Swank develop a deep surrogate bond that leads them through the gritty low-stakes female-boxing circuit. Million Dollar Baby sets the stage for a hard-won triumph-over-adversity tale but its too wise about the boxing world to fall for easy victories or even the redeeming spirited letdown of the original Rocky. In Eastwoods hands the standard training montages have a hushed meditative quality with a specific emphasis on the scientific half of ""the sweet science"" that no doubt stems from Boyds experience. Though the rambling narrative shows signs of squeezing a few short stories into one--the last 30 minutes in particular seem like another movie altogether--the film coheres around groups of characters that integrate more tightly as it goes along. The three leads are all superb even the seemingly miscast Swank who finally rediscovers the Method intensity thats been missing since Boys Dont Cry. But Million Dollar Baby belongs to Eastwood the icon and the auteur whose weathered face tells a story like nothing hes done since Unforgiven and whose direction resonates with quiet insistent soul.

"A Wrenching Knockout - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Eastwood A Wrenching Knockoutmovies - review`Million Dollar Baby Is Hilary Swanks Movie -- Shes Terrific As A Fighter Struggling To Be Somebody.January 28 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie Critic""The best cut-man in the business"" may have just lost his last chance to train a champ. Hes patched up his last bloodied boxer.The new kid isnt really a kid. At 32 this fighter is a little late to the game without the years it will take to learn the craft and make a career.A fighter needs a trainer but the old cut-man keeps his distance. For a while anyway.Million Dollar Baby is built on a million boxing-picture cliches. But Clint Eastwoods jewel of a drama nominated for seven Academy Awards flips enough of those cliches to give us something new a boxing drama that becomes a wrenching dark and grand love story.The ""kid"" fighter is Oscar winner Hilary Swank playing an Ozark-bred waitress named Maggie eager to risk her rawboned good looks on the fight games new wrinkle -- female prizefighters.""People seen me fight say Im pretty tough"" she tells Frankie the trainer.""Girlie tough aint enough.""Eastwood himself is Frankie the grizzled gym-rat Maggie nags into training her. Morgan Freeman is the ex-boxer who lives in their L.A. gym cleans it and encourages Maggies ambitions.Whats novel in the films first two-thirds is watching Swank develop a fighters body and moves. Shes no Michelle Rodriguez the ferocious and streetwise star of Girlfight. But shes credible and she gets across that hunger that the great athletes have.Eastwood is a little too Hollywood to play a guy truly beaten down by boxing. But its still a likably unlikable turn even if hell never be Burgess Meredith.And Freeman is perfectly cast in a smaller role. He narrates this Shawshank Requiem for a Heavyweight a tale remembered by the soulful old man who saw it all happen.Eastwood isnt above working in cute touches. Jay Baruchel is ""Danger"" a mental lightweight who uses the gym as an outlet for his delusions of fight fame emceeing the title fights of his mind. And Eastwoods Frankie goes to Mass every day and comically and profanely baits his priest (Brian OByrne). The joking obscures the grim truth. Frankie is atoning for a sin that is never revealed.Theres plenty of color and rough texture in this world of sweat and blood and leather. Veteran TV writer Paul Haggis makes this script based on some F.X. Toole short stories spare and literary.""Boxing is about respect -- getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy.""But this is Swanks movie. As Maggie you can hear the poverty she came from in her voice. Swank is good enough to make you forget shes a lovely movie star playing a lonely no-options waitress who needs boxing to make money and a place for herself in the world. She may have come from ""trash"" as she puts it but theres nobility in her heart. She craves that respect.That is this films message. As Unforgiven was about guilt and regret Million Dollar Baby zeroes in on the brutal primal appeal of ""The Sweet Science.""Maybe weve seen too many versions of poor men using the deadly sport as their only way to as Brando put it in On the Waterfront ""be somebody."" Give that dream to a woman and you bring the risk home and show why shes willing to take it.Respect just another form of love. And that quest for respect is what allows this solid boxing drama to flirt with greatness.

Just save this column for after youve seen it because I intend to explain why-unlike my esteemed colleagues-I dont share their enthusiasm for this film. So Im going to have to give away more than a few plot details in order to support my case. Let me begin by saying that no movie in my memory has depressed me more than Million Dollar Baby. I saw it twice first at an early screening and later on DVD and though I was not as depressed the second time it still left me feeling pretty grim. Adapted from a screenplay by Paul Haggis Million Dollar Baby is based on a collection of stories entitled Rope Burns Stories from the Corner by veteran boxing cut-man F.X. Toole. Mr. Eastwood a remarkably energetic 74 plays grizzled fight trainer Frankie Dunn. Along with his buddy and onetime fighter Eddie (Scrap) Dupris played by Morgan Freeman Frankie runs an old-timers gym in downtown Los Angeles which also doubles as the place that Scrap sleeps. The two buddies petty-squabbling camaraderie resembles that of an old married couple much like their magically bonded gunfighters in Mr. Eastwoods Unforgiven (1992). The picture begins with Frankie managing a promising young heavyweight Big Willie Little (Mike Colter) but after several impressive victories Big Willie walks out on Frankie because the manager is reluctant to set up a title fight. One of the many demons in Frankies guilt-ridden past is Scraps partial blindness incurred when Frankie managed him in a title fight that ended Scraps boxing career. Another demon the many letters returned unopened from Frankies estranged daughter to whom he nonetheless keeps writing regularly. Frankie virtually besieges Father Horvak (Brian OByrne) his parish priest for advice on suitably atoning for his past sins with studying to read W.B. Yeats in the original Gaelic being one of his atonement rituals. In line with the lower-class sociology of boxing the fighters in the gym are either black or Latino-at least until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up. She begins working inexpertly on a punching bag with the avowed intention of becoming a boxing champion under Frankies tutelage. Leaving her trailer-park-trash family to work for pennies and leftovers as a waitress in a cheap restaurant Maggies determined to make good in the ring. Frankie tries to discourage her by pointing out that at 33 shes much too old to begin training as a fighter. But with Scraps help Maggie perseveres to the point where she starts winning club fights. Of course a surrogate father-daughter relationship springs up between Frankie and Maggie-he even devises the shrewd promotional gimmick of presenting her as a proud Irish fighter to secure an ethnic fan base. And then the downfall. The first sour note is struck when Maggie spends some of her earnings to buy her mother and siblings a new house. Margo Martindale as Maggies mother should win some sort of award for all-time movie mother from hell; despite her daughters generosity she sneeringly taunts Maggie that everyone laughs at her for the way she earns a living. Still theres some consolation in Maggies triumphant world tour with people cheering for her everywhere she goes. When she returns to America Maggies in prime form for a championship bout against an opponent who fights so dirty that she makes Mike Tyson look like a choirboy. The fight gets underway and Maggie seems to be winning-until in an unguarded moment after the bells rung her opponent slugs her with a sucker punch so ferocious that it sends Maggie reeling across the ring her head crashing into the stool that Frankie pulls up after the bell. Maggie is now a basket case sucking oxygen from a tube in a hospital bed. She pleads with Frankie to help end her life. Adding to the horror Monster Mom shows up along with her entire greedy brood and a contract-wielding lawyer to sign all of Maggies earnings over to her ""family."" ""You lost darlin you lost"" says the mom reducing her daughter to total humiliation. When Maggie is unable to sign the contract-her hands are paralyzed-her mother obligingly places the pen in her mouth after which Maggie comes into her own by spitting out the pen cursing the entire family and sending them scurrying out of the hospital like rats from a sinking ship. What I found most perplexing about the tragic turn of events was how a championship fight that ended in a quasi-criminal act fails to illicit any repercussions or protests by Frankie or anyone else. I know John F. Kennedy said that life was unfair long before he was assassinated and I know film critics have been conditioned to condemn happy endings but does that warrant such excessive malignancy? Whats amused and frustrated me somewhat is how critics have scrupulously avoided going into detail on the sudden pile-up of misfortunes that supposedly makes Mr. Eastwoods film so moving. Of course they dont want to spoil the fun for the audience who are left wincing over the sudden onset of terminal pain and sorrow. But I would suggest that to describe the final outcome as ""tragedy"" as some critics have done is a gross misstatement. Tragedies dont depress me because they are carefully constructed to avoid the vagaries of blind accident and random evil. In the end Frankie accedes to Maggies pleas and facilitates her suicide-after which according to Scraps narration Frankie disappears from view never to be seen again. The thorny issue of mercy killing becomes something of an anticlimax next to the oppressive conjunction of an evil fighter and a monster mother-I would argue that nothing in the narrative prepares us for such a disastrous denouement though some critics claim to have discerned an ominous darkening of the texture of the film as it seemed to be rollicking along on its Rocky-like inspirational way. I beg to differ as I rest my case against Million Dollar Baby. This is not to say that I wish to demean the work of Mr. Eastwood Mr. Freeman and Ms. Swank They are all excellent in what is in my perhaps ultra-Aristotelian view a losing cause. Sweet Release Alejandro Amenabars The Sea Inside (in Spanish with English subtitles) based on Ramon Sampedros book Letters from Hell also tells the story of a handicapped protagonist wishing to terminate his life in order to die with dignity. But whereas Million Dollar Baby left me despondent The Sea Inside left me exhilarated. So my problem is not with the complex feelings involved in the desire of the afflicted to die with dignity but in how the story of the death-seeker is told. Where Million Dollar Baby sinks into the pit of bottomless despair The Sea Inside soars to the fantastically romantic heights of love between a man and a woman. And when I say ""soar"" I mean it literally to describe one of the greatest love scenes in the history of the cinema. Javier Bardem plays Ramon Sampedro a 55-year-old quadriplegic who was left paralyzed after a diving accident 30 years earlier. In his bedridden state he spends years petitioning the secular authorities in Spain to give him the right to terminate his life with dignity. The love scene to which I referred occurs after he falls in love with Belen Ruedas Julia a lawyer who has come to help him file his judicial plea. Julia is partially handicapped herself using a cane to move about because of a degenerative disease. She is married and Ramon is bed-ridden but they nevertheless attain an unprecedented degree of spiritual rapport. Then one day to the stirring melody of Giacomo Puccinis aria ""I shall conquer"" from Turandot Ramon rises magically from his bed pulls it away from the window so as to get a running start and flies through the window to the seashore where he meets Julia for a passionate embrace. There is more than a little directorial audacity in this dream-like incursion into the realms that Blaise Pascal best summed up in the aphorism ""The heart has its reasons."" This audacity would seem to come naturally to a director whose earlier oeuvre was drenched in otherworldliness in films like Thesis (1996) Open Your Eyes (1997) and The Others (2001). There are two other women in Ramons physically but not emotionally curtailed existence Lola Duenas Rosa a volcanically mixed-up and messed-up mother of two who sees in Ramon a man to whom she can pour out her heart without having it trampled in the mud and Mabel Riveras Manuela Ramons sister-in-law who is devoted more to Ramons needs than to the needs of her own family. The only question (and it is eventually answered) is which of these women loves him enough to satisfy his hearts desire and thus be parted from him forever. Throughout his seemingly endless ordeal Mr. Bardems Ramon like his real-life counterpart remains a cheerfully smiling presence to the people who flock to his bedside to be cheered up from their own various malaises. This joyous stoicism of Ramon is rendered brilliantly by Mr. Bardem currently one of the worlds great actors. Maid in L.A. James L. Brooks Spanglish from his own screenplay could be charged with reverse bigotry for the lopsided contrast it makes between a Mexican nanny named Flor (Paz Vega) and her wealthy Los Angeles employer Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni). Indeed Mr. Brooks directs Ms. Leoni an actress who is no stranger to subtlety in the same shrill single note for almost the entire film. The critics and I presume the public are virtually forced to hate her character-though when you think about it she never does anything really malicious except possibly buying clothes a few sizes too small for her chubby daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele). By contrast Flor the good cop kindly sews an outfit for Bernice that fits perfectly. Adam Sandler plays Deborahs hapless husband John Clasky a world-class celebrity chef. In a reversal of type Mr. Sandler plays a Casper Milquetoast character responding invariably with gentleness and sensitivity to Deborahs most outrageous outbursts. Also adding to the chaos in the household is Deborahs cheerfully heavy-drinking mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). The story is actually narrated by Flors precocious daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in a flash-forward to her application to Princeton despite her illegal-immigrant background. But just when I was about to write off Mr. Brooks film as that of a wealthy self-hating do-gooder with a weakness for Latino babes he suddenly began switching his point of view to reveal that the source of Deborahs angst had much to do with her failed career and her unhappy childhood with a drunkenly promiscuous mother. In one of the funniest scenes ever of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking people trying to communicate-a scene which shows how resourceful a child actress Ms. Bruce is-Christina not only translates for her mother but also improvises gestures and movements to dramatize the emotional content of her mothers words. This howl of a scene is alone worth the price of admission. I also liked the scene in which Deborah makes Flor look a bit foolish trying to outrun her on the way home with the overachieving Deborah for once not even realizing that shes being challenged. Still its no accident that ""Span-"" precedes ""-glish"" in this piece of special pleading for the immigrant population. The film gets better as it goes along however and all the characters including Deborah become more interesting and appealing as we get to know them better. Come to think of it Mr. Brooks has always had a tendency to become shrill even in his best movies like Terms of Endearment (1983) and Broadcast News (1987). Spanglish is far from his best but it is good enough for these generally witless times. An Italian Classic Luchino Visconti (1906-1976) adapted Guiseppe di Lampedusas penetrating historical novel of Sicily in 1860 into The Leopard one of the greatest motion pictures of all time as well as one of the most politically profound. The Film Forum is showing the entire uncut Italian version-195 minutes including the 45-minute concluding ballroom scene which encapsulates all the themes of the film in lavish style as the life of a man slowly fades away. With Burt Lancaster Alain Delon Claudia Cardinale Serge Regianni and Paolo Stoppa (Jan. 12 to 20). Comment Filed under At the Movies Clint Eastwood James L.

Frankie Dunn the irascible old cuss who reluctantly takes on a young female boxer named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a man of few words whose strictly-business approach to training is to strip his fighters ""down to the bare wood."" At the same time Frankie has a flair for ballyhoo evidenced by the flashy silk robe he designs for Maggie -- emblazoned with a Gaelic nickname that quickly catches on with her fans -- and the bagpipe players he commissions to escort her into the arena before a pivotal fight. Underneath Frankies crusty exterior lies the romantic heart of an unabashed showman. The same could be said for Eastwood who directed produced and composed the music for ""Million Dollar Baby."" To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely May-December friendship set against the grit and grandeur of the boxing world Eastwood uses the same filmmaking basics -- good writing; a timeless textured visual style; and simple straightforward narrative -- that made such past films as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"" so admired. As in those films ""Million Dollar Baby"" proves the famously taciturn Eastwood is not afraid of big emotions; what starts out as a lean but heartwarming tale of determination and loyalty becomes a full-blown three-hankie melodrama by its wrenching third act. As an actor and as a filmmaker Eastwood may not go in for flashy gimmicks or look-at-me antics but in his own hard-bitten way hes as adept at modern-day tear-jerkers as the masters of the 1940s and 1950s. The strength of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is in the relationships among Frankie (Clint Eastwood) Scrap-Iron (Morgan Freeman) and Maggie (Hilary Swank). (Merie W.

Between the timeless look and tone of the film -- set in such locales as Frankies grimy gym the Hit Pit as well as retro-looking coffee shops boxing rings and a Hopper-esque roadside diner -- and archetypal characters that only occasionally slip into caricature ""Million Dollar Baby"" has the sort of universal aesthetic and themes that can appeal as much to teenagers as to their parents and even grandparents (assuming of course that no one will faint at the sight of a young womans broken nose cracked back into place or copious amounts of blood). Based on a book of short stories by F.X. Toole (the pseudonym of the late ringside assistant Jerry Boyd) ""Million Dollar Baby"" is as lean if not mean as the boxers at the Hit Pit Dispensing with lots of back story it simply introduces Frankie as a ""cut man"" -- the guy in the corner who swabs up a boxers seeping cheek or split eyebrow -- with some deep-seated issues. Hes a good trainer even a great one but he chokes when it comes time to get his fighters title bouts; he attends Mass every day but regularly engages his priest in playful theological debates; hes estranged from his daughter for reasons unknown. When Maggie arrives on the scene like a melting-eyed stray puppy he wants nothing to do with her. It takes his best friend and gym janitor ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) to convince Frankie that Maggie might be worth another look. As with Frankie were not told much about Maggie or how she came to discover that at 31 shes destined to become a champion boxer. All we know from the montages of her workouts at the Hit Pit and her life as a waitress at a local cafe is that shes a young woman of extraordinary discipline self-confidence and physical strength. (This doesnt impress Frankie however ""Girlie tough aint enough"" he tells her sharing one of many of his signature aphorisms.) Although ""Million Dollar Baby"" takes its sweet time getting there the audience knows its a foregone conclusion that these two people of integrity subtle wit and hidden depths (Frankie reads Yeats in Gaelic) will adopt each other as family. But its predictability doesnt make their collaboration any less gratifying especially when Maggie begins her fighting career in earnest. Eastwood films these sequences with the verve and immediacy of the great boxing films and no matter where you stand on the morality of pugilism you cant deny that few sports lend themselves so readily to the movie camera. Juxtaposing these scenes of visceral even animal energy with the affectionate verbal sparring between Frankie and Scrap back at the Hit Pit Eastwood creates a world that while defined by the willingness and ability to punch the daylights out of someone else hews to its own upstanding conventions of honor and courage. These are tough guys with hearts of gold and if filmgoers cant see that theyll surely hear it in Freemans soothingly poetic narration of the tale. But conventions however comforting can also veer into cliche and ""Million Dollar Baby"" has more than a few most of them in the form of any character with a Southern accent. A dimwitted denizen of the gym nicknamed Danger seems to be the live-action version of Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel from ""The Simpsons."" And it seems that Maggies good-for-nothing family back in the Ozarks could have been more effectively drawn without the tattoos gimme caps and over-the-top venality. Still the heart of ""Million Dollar Baby"" lies in the core relationships among Frankie Maggie and Scrap friendships so pure so genuine so authentic that it takes actors of Eastwoods Swanks and Freemans caliber to sell them in this otherwise cynical world. And it takes a filmmaker as adroit as Eastwood in blending restraint and old-fashioned schmaltz to create movies that shamelessly and even by design can make a grown man cry. Million Dollar Baby (137 minutes at Loews Georgetown) is rated PG-13 for violence brief profanity and some disturbing images and themes.

Its a rule Frankie Dunn lives by and he drills it into the fighters he trains. Its why his fighters dont become contenders. They get new managers and move on to bigger purses. Frankie stays behind. Protected. Theres nothing particularly subtle about the way Clint Eastwood handles this in his new boxing movie Million Dollar Baby. He lays it all out for you -- his main characters contradictions -- in his patented measured old-fashioned style. The style fits because this is an old-fashioned movie. It feels like the kind of film Eastwood mightve watched as a teenager in the 1940s and even then the cliches were old. Million Dollar Baby can get away with cliches however because instead of Jimmy Cagney or John Garfield in boxing trunks it has Hilary Swank and it pivots on issues films of the 1940s wouldnt touch. One of those -- women in the boxing ring -- is obvious. The less said about the rest the better. Much of the movies power comes from the element of surprise. When you think you know its moves it throws in fancy footwork. Then it sucker-punches you when youre not looking. Movie critics love Eastwood. Whether this stems from respect for his longevity nostalgia for a no-longer-fashionable style of filmmaking or compensation for dismissing him early in his career we overpraise his movies. But Million Dollar Baby deserves the accolades. It is his best film since Unforgiven. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn a crusty gravelly voiced gym owner whos eyeing retirement. Eastwood has never gotten much respect for his minimalist acting. Much about Frankie feels familiar but a gruff warmth and decency comes through that -- in the heartbreaking context of the story -- is powerfully affecting. Morgan Freeman is Scrap an equally crusty ex-fighter who takes care of the gym and lives in a shabby room behind it. Scraps career ended when he lost the sight in one eye. Frankie who was his cut man blames himself for not finding a way to protect his friend. Swank playing Maggie Fitzgerald a dirt-poor 31-year-old from the Ozarks starts hanging out at the gym trying to get Frankie to train her. Of course he refuses. Hes old school. But you sense there may be something more. Frankie has an estranged daughter. We dont know what he did to hurt her so much that she wont answer his letters but hes in pain atoning for it. So the last thing he wants is to see a young woman injured. Maggie starts out looking scrawny in oversized sweatsuits. Thats so that when Frankie finally agrees to train her she can wear skimpier outfits to give the impression shes developing muscles. Scrap narrates the movie. His narration is sprinkled with thoughts on boxing some of which have double meaning. He explains for instance that sometimes a fighter must step back to deliver the strongest punch. ""But step back too far"" he adds ""and you aint fighting at all."" Thats Frankie. He thinks hes still in the game but hes been stepping back for years. Maggie gets him back in; he becomes engaged once more with life and with boxing. Shes old for a fighter yet she becomes a contender. Their relationship goes deeper than that though. Its a father-daughter love story. When we meet Maggies family -- heartless opportunists -- we realize why Frankies so important to her. ""I got nobody but you"" she tells him. Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay. In 1996 he created and wrote a spectacular though short-lived TV series titled EZ Streets. Million Dollar Baby -- which he adapted from a short story collection by ex-fight manager F.X. Toole -- has a similar brooding Irish-inflected feel. It isnt a perfect film. We dont get a sharp enough feel for the gym for one thing. Instead of immersing us in it the movie gives us a ""representation"" of it with pat scenes and one-dimensional characters. And most of the scenes inside the ring lack the immediacy we want to see in fight films. No matter. Like a battered pug moving stolidly across the ring -- and like its 74-year-old director -- Million Dollar Baby shows its age but it packs a killer punch.

Clint Eastwoods movie is not only a great tribute to the ""sweet science"" of boxing but also to the old-time movies and fiction devoted to it. Based on two short stories in ""Rope Burns"" by F.X. Toole (the pseudonym of former cut-man Jerry Boyd) its a gut-stirring tall tale about a boxer (one buff Hilary Swank) her crusty trainer (Eastwood) and the wily old boxing gym proprietor (Morgan Freeman) who narrates the story. _____More in Movies_____  Million Dollar Baby National Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  Movie Trailer Library  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now They are archetypes all three of them and thats what makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" feel so wonderfully antiquated so blissfully free of postmodern cleverness. This story which Paul Haggis adapted from Tooles collection could have taken place in the 1940s as much as the present day. Sign on for this movie and you are in a different world where the rules are simple Hit first and hit hard or kiss the canvas. Sometimes you do all the right things and you still end up facedown in your own blood. But you get back up because theres something glorious about winning in that ring. As in the world of gambling you will lose sooner or later. But you love the challenge. You love to believe. Thats the fantasy beating in the heart of Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) a hardscrabble waitress in her early thirties who comes from the hills of South Dakota. She has left her welfare-cheating mother nasty siblings and grim past for something hopeful. Shes got that dream and the willpower. So she joins Frankie Dunns gym hoping to persuade Frank (Eastwood) to be her trainer. No dice he tells her. He doesnt train ""girls."" Watching all this through his one good eye is Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Freeman) the prizefighter-turned-house-manager who has seen it all. Theres a sign on Franks wall. It says ""Winners are simply willing to do what losers wont."" Maggie doesnt just believe it. As it turns out she lives it. Frank has just led a male boxer (Mike Colter) to the brink of a championship but has refused to put him in the ultimate prizefight until hes ready. Two more fights he promises. But the boxer leaves Frank for another manager. Once again Frank has lost out. He takes another look at Maggie flapping with determination at the punching bag. He winces. Shes not moving her feet right. Shes holding her breath. She needs a trainer. ""If I take you . . . "" Frank begins. ""I promise you Ill work so hard"" exclaims Maggie. ""God this is a mistake already"" says Frank. Well of course he takes her on. And their growing affection for each other and teamwork becomes a powerful combination. Theyre going to need this togetherness when they face an unexpected challenge which really road-tests the young fighters heart. As Maggie Swank is a package of dynamite a determined soul with too much to prove and too little time to do it in to worry about defeat. Eastwood is so good in this movie it almost feels like cheating. Of course he can play craggy surly and ultimately charming. Shouldnt he play something else? But on the other hand why mess with a winning combination. He slips on Frankies persona like a favorite old suit. If his relationship with Swanks Maggie is the heartbreaker his banter with Freemans Eddie is the movies greatest pleasure. The two of them go at each other based on years of fine-tuning their running arguments. Eddie gives him grief about his bad choices in life. Frank returns the favor. And there is a comic routine between them concerning Eddies hole-ridden socks that the writers of ""Seinfeld"" would have killed for. In ""Million Dollar Baby"" some of the best boxing occurs outside the ring. MILLION DOLLAR BABY (PG-13 137 minutes) -- Contains some brutal boxing violence emotional intensity and obscenity.

A shining boxer lifes dark blowsBy Steven Rea INQUIRER MOVIE CRITICPosted January 07 2005In many ways Million Dollar Baby is a glorious throwback Its a boxing movie with pummeling and pathos ringside drama and despair - a genre that goes back to the silents that embraces everything from tough-guy tragedy to shameless tearjerker from the hardscrabble realism of Body and Soul to the South Philly underdog dreams of Stallones Rocky series.But its not just the casting of a woman - Hilary Swank in a performance even more brilliantly turned than her Oscar-winning portrait in 1999s Boys Dont Cry - that makes Million Dollar Baby something more than a retro-feeling homage. (Girlfight the 2000 indie with Michelle Rodriguez as a scowling Brooklynite who puts on boxing gloves used an old-style fight-pic template in everything but its protagonists gender.)Directed by Clint Eastwood and costarring Eastwood as the veteran trainer who takes on a toothy diner waitress who displays some talent in the ring Million Dollar Baby serves up the conventions of the boxing movie with absolute finesse - with relish even - and then goes deep and dark into themes that strike at the core of human experience.Along the way audiences are treated to three fully drawn complex characters Swanks trailer-park pugilist Maggie Fitzgerald; Eastwoods Frankie Dunn a weary soul who runs a shabby boxing gym in downtown L.A. and Morgan Freemans Scrap a retired fighter who pushes a broom around Frankies gym - and pushes Frankies buttons in sly sage ways.As a filmmaker Eastwood who learned from no-nonsense Hollywood storytellers like Don Siegel keeps getting better. Like Unforgiven (his first teaming with Freeman) and Mystic River the new picture takes its time gives its actors room to breathe and isnt afraid to strike a hokey note if it reveals something important. Real life after all is full of hokiness.As an actor Eastwood displays a vulnerability and a deep-seated pain that the stoic icon of all those westerns and cop flicks never dared. Frankie Dunn is a guy teaching himself Gaelic. He quotes from Yeats and sneers unsympathetically at the skinny simpleton who hangs around his place the Hit Pit. That character ""Danger"" Barch played by Jay Baruchel is the films weakest a mawkish mascot there to milk sympathy even though every boxing movie needs and has its deluded dreamer.Frankie is a Catholic and a cynic attending Mass on a daily basis where he happily harasses the young priest with questions of doctrine and faith. And he is a failed father with an estranged daughter who finds redemption in the guise of the solitary woman who shows up at his door wanting to learn how to knock people silly.As for Maggie Swank brings both physical and psychological conviction to the role. On the far side of 30 with no friends and no future she latches onto the notion of becoming a prizefighter with a doggedness and a gleam in her eye that will make you smile. In fact it makes Maggie herself smile and her sunny determination sets Frankie - who insists at first that shes too old to train and anyway he doesnt teach girls - to grit his teeth and grumble sideways (as only Eastwood can).Freeman watchful discerning presents an old man with holes in his socks and stories to tell and does it with effortless-looking ease. The exchanges between Frankie and Scrap full of unfinished sentences and affectionate insults are a pleasure to witness two seasoned colleagues with decades of history good and bad behind them jawboning and jousting - leaving the important stuff unsaid because they dont have to say anything at all. Watching Eastwood and Freeman is of course a huge part of the thrill but the two screen legends are both diligently into their roles.Million Dollar Baby is a tricky thing to write about - or discuss when youre with folks who havent yet seen it. It doesnt follow the standard arc of a boxing-ring melodrama and it doesnt leave you feeling pumped up and satisfied with the cheap triumphs of a Rocky-esque yarn. Eastwood and company have aimed for something far more complicated - and theyve hit their target dead-on. This heartbreaking film with its rich performances and simple eloquence lays claim to greatness.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.Million Dollar Baby (out of four stars)Produced by Clint Eastwood Albert S.

By Jonathan Rosenbaum JonathanRosenba Million Dollar Baby (Masterpiece) Directed by Clint Eastwood Written by Paul Haggis With Eastwood Morgan Freeman Hilary Swank Jay Baruchel and Mike Colter The Aviator  (A must-see) Directed by Martin Scorsese Written by John Logan With Leonardo DiCaprio Cate Blanchett Alec Baldwin Alan Alda John C. Reilly Kate Beckinsale Adam Scott and Ian Holm Despite his grace and precision as a director Clint Eastwood like Martin Scorsese is at the mercy of his scripts. But in Million Dollar Baby hes got a terrific one adapted by Paul Haggis from Rope Burns Stories From the Corner. This book was the first published work by Jerry Boyd writing under the pseudonym F.X. Toole after 40 years of rejection slips. Boyd had been a fight manager and ""cut man"" the guy who stops boxers from bleeding so they can stay in the ring and he was 70 when the book came out; he died two years later just before completing his first novel. This movie is permeated by those 40 years of rejection and the wisdom of age is evident in it as well. Henry Bumstead the brilliant production designer who helped create the minimalist canvas--he was art director on Hitchcocks Vertigo (1958) and has been working for Eastwood since 1992--will turn 90 in March and Eastwood himself will be 75 a couple months later. All these years pay off in economy as well as observation. The offscreen narration is by a one-eyed ex-boxer named Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) Scrap for short who helps run a gym called the Hit Pit. But the story belongs mainly to his best friend Frankie Dunn the gyms owner (Eastwood) and Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) the 31-year-old hillbilly Frankie reluctantly agrees to train and manage. This leads to some awkward point-of-view issues concerning what Scrap saw and what he merely surmised or heard about that are problematic only if one chooses to focus on them. Having him recount events sometime after they happened only adds to the fatalistic noir atmosphere. As a boxing movie this is every bit as grim as The Set-Up (1949) and Fat City (1972) and as an underlit look at a seedy American subculture set mainly in a few lairlike locations its as dark and doom ridden as the 1961 The Hustler (with which it paradoxically shares a Scope format) and Eastwoods own Bird (1988). I cant think of many things Im less drawn to than boxing. Million Dollar Baby tends to view it as neither an especially interesting sport nor a metaphor for something else (as Raging Bull does) but rather as a particularly acute form of savagery in a savage world. ""Boxing is about respect"" Scrap observes early on ""getting it for yourself and taking it away from the other guy."" Yet unlike Raging Bulls Jake LaMotta Maggie shows few signs of vengefulness or spite. She merely wants to make her mark in a world where shes long been labeled trailer trash. Apart from that we know little about her past or about Frankies and one of this movies triumphs is that it says as much as it does despite minimizing its backstories and offscreen space. The performances of the three leads are perfect so we dont care that we dont know what lies right outside the Hit Pit. Unlike most other Eastwood films this one has no sex depicted or remembered. We know Frankie has a daughter and that he writes her every week but the letters are all returned and we never learn anything else about her. We also know nothing about her mother. When we belatedly get an account of how Scrap lost his eye and how Frankie was involved this information almost feels like a glut. We learn more about Frankies troubled Catholicism (he habitually attends mass and has an ongoing dialogue with a priest afterward) and his nurturing of his Irish roots (he studies Gaelic and reads Yeats) than we do about his everyday life especially before he agrees to train Maggie. We never learn how Maggie spent her 20s. And the two glimpses of Maggies mother and some of her other family members may be more than we care to know. Conservatives routinely link themselves to ""family values"" yet this movie by a conservative filmmaker gives us one of the most negative views of family Ive ever encountered. In a bleak world where neither family nor religious faith offers any lasting respite Million Dollar Baby offers redemption that derives from the informal and nameless loving relationships people create on their own rather than inherit from family church or society. The movies most memorable image--included in the trailer in spite of its apparent irrelevance to the plot--occurs in a filling station when Maggie glimpses and waves at a little girl holding a puppy in the front seat of an adjacent truck a character we never see again. Later we see Maggie and Frankie enjoying lemon pie together at a roadside joint. Such moments though surrounded by ugliness darkness and violence offer all the transcendence we need. In a context so close to despair small but considered acts of kindness and fleeting moments of happiness carry the force of epiphanies.    Lots can be said for The Aviator as entertainment though not much for it as edification. John Logans witty yet shallow script suggests well learn something significant about the psychology of Howard Hughes (1905-76) but it doesnt deliver. Logan and Scorsese held my attention for all 169 minutes--through the comic extravaganza of Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) blowing a wad on his first talkie (the 1930 Hells Angels) the spectacle of his building and flying planes while romancing all the pretty ladies in sight and his intrigues as he defies and outwits corporate entities larger than his own such as MGM TWA and the U.S. government. But then the movie concludes with Hughes repeating the phrase ""the wave of the future"" like a broken record and I couldnt figure out whether Logan and Scorsese were trying to illustrate a Hughes tic I hadnt heard about evoke the specter of future multicorporate takeovers or simply distract the audience from its questions. The movie starts off on the wrong foot by offering a scene of young Howard standing naked in a tub in an ornate living room while his mother sponges him down and teaches him how to spell quarantine warning him about the horrors of typhus and ""the colored."" Its as if Logan and Scorsese wanted one pithy bit of psychological backstory that could account for the multifaceted craziness of Hughes as a grown-up including his phobia of germs his paranoia and his reclusiveness. This is the only glimpse of his boyhood offered and its less an explanation than a cover for the absence of one a ruse to keep us from asking too many questions. Its also a symptom of a cinephiliac malady that Ill call an acute case of Rosebud--a need to make numerous visual and stylistic references to Citizen Kane even though they cloud more issues than they clarify. I can guess how these references might have been rationalized. Its well-known that Orson Welles considered making a film about Hughes before he opted for William Randolph Hearst; some of the details are in Welless autobiographical F for Fake. But its wise to remember that Kane is a fictional character and that the use of the word ""Rosebud"" as a key to unlock the mystery of his life is undermined in the films final speech ""I dont think any word can explain a mans life."" Using quarantine as if it were an equivalent of Rosebud even in passing is a sign that this movie is more interested in pop mythology than in getting to the bottom of any character real or fictional. Admittedly keeping audiences from asking too many questions is one way of defining entertainment and for the most part Scorsese does succeed as an entertainer. If we accept contrary to some biographies that Hughess romantic involvement with Katharine Hepburn was a major part of his life were primed for one of the films most nuanced achievements in pop mythology and can sit back and enjoy Cate Blanchetts crafty impersonation and Logans hilarious dialogue for her. (""I adore the theater"" she says. ""Only alive onstage. Ill teach you. Well see some Ibsen. If the Republicans havent outlawed him by now. Youre not a Republican are you?"") And even if we cant believe quite as readily in Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner her characters maternal sweetness is still touching. Similarly Scorseses climactic treatment of Hughes crash-landing his XF-11 plane in Beverly Hills--after scraping off the tops and sides of buildings--is a spectacular and highly suspenseful bit of bravura filmmaking that works best if we can overlook how people other than Hughes were affected. As Michael Atkinson notes in the Village Voice ""Its hard not to wonder who else was hurt or killed in that crash but their names are apparently lost to or bought out of history."" I wondered the same thing and by not taking up the question Scorsese ultimately fails for me as an entertainer though some will no doubt see the shock-and-awe crash as funny (as David Denby did). Others will be disturbed by the loose ends and reminded of our current tendency to overlook the casualties caused by ""visionary"" leaders. The Aviator focuses on the early adulthood of Hughes--""during his scrappy years from the late 1920s to late 1940s"" as one piece of infotainment puts it ""when he fought the Hollywood establishment and pushed bounds on sex and violence in film dated parades of starlets and oversaw creation of the worlds biggest and fastest planes."" I was disappointed that it stopped just before Hughes took over the RKO studio and revealed contradictory aspects of his right-wing politics. He assigned several RKO directors a film called I Married a Communist in the late 40s and early 50s as a test of their patriotism figuring that anyone who turned the project down was automatically suspect. Yet he also protected a leading Hollywood radical Nicholas Ray from being blacklisted so that Ray could patch up several Hughes features. But my ideal Hughes biopic isnt Scorseses which as the title suggests is mainly about the mans obsession with planes--and about the wealth power and glamour of the youthful Charles Foster Kane. A more charitable reading of this movies thematic thrust might say it broaches the mystery of how a dysfunctional obsessive managed to accomplish as much as he did beyond what his billions bought him. This reading might even fit in with the Kane references insofar as the enduring popularity of Citizen Kane probably has more to do with a worship of power--Welless and Kanes--than with an exploration of the title heros personal failings. But by and large I think this movies chief function is to give Scorsese an opportunity to indulge in the pleasures of big-time filmmaking and to treat the audience to a heady dose of glamour--knocking our socks off with period re-creations of the Cocoanut Grove Graumans Chinese and two-strip Technicolor. All thats justification enough for any entertainment and on this level The Aviator does even better than most of Hughess own movies (not including Scarface which he had the good sense to let Howard Hawks direct). There just isnt a lot to chew on once its over. If you ignore most questions you dont wind up with many answers.

PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED SOLELY ... more Million Dollar Baby / The gritty bruised world of boxing has quiet dignity in the hands of Clint Eastwood 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Million Dollar Baby Drama. Starring Clint Eastwood Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Million Dollar Baby"" the latest from Clint Eastwood is about an old trainer who takes on a female boxer. Just saying that of course conjures up a host of images most of them cliches from every boxing movie ever made. But ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a conventional boxing movie or even a conventional sports movie. Its concerns and ambitions are in a completely different direction. Part of what makes this film different is the story which cant be talked about in detail without damaging the first experience of it. Other elements can be discussed -- for one thing the movies fablelike quality which fully emerges only days after seeing it. ""Million Dollar Baby"" ages well in memory because it gradually seems to mean more. Its meaning cant be summed up in a sentence but it has to do with a view of life as inexpressibly sad and yet always right. This is an old mans view and it reminded me not of anything from another movie but of Lincolns Second Inaugural the part in which Lincoln looking back on the bloodbath of the Civil War and anticipating more carnage to come quoted Psalms ""The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."" Lincoln wasnt an old man just an old soul but the trainer is an old man and so is Eastwood. The weight of years is in ""Million Dollar Baby "" technically artistically and philosophically. It has the gloom and transcendence of an old mans wisdom. Related Stories Eastwoods Million Dollar Baby gets even better over time The gloom sometimes affects the pace. In the first minutes theres something slack about ""Million Dollar Baby."" Morgan Freeman as Eddie the boxing club manager narrates the film and for some reason Paul Haggis script finds it necessary to introduce every would-be boxer in the picture. After that expository detour the focus is on Frankie (Eastwood) a trainer and expert ""cut man"" and his efforts on behalf of a heavyweight contender (Mike Colter). It takes a while for Eastwood both as Frankie and as the films director to turn his attention to the girl in the gym -- Maggie (Hilary Swank) -- a dirt-poor waitress from southern Missouri who wants to box professionally. At first Frankie tells her that he doesnt train ""girlies"" and that at 31 shes too old to become a boxer anyway. But he sees her every day at the gym and begins to feel sorry for her. For the audience it isnt that Maggie wants to be a boxer thats important but rather that she wants something badly. Swank conveys that hunger convincingly and poignantly and its the most important thing she does in ""Million Dollar Baby."" (The second most important thing is that she makes us believe she can box.) For Maggie boxing isnt just a ticket out of poverty but an expression of self something vital and in her eyes beautiful. And so Frankie and Maggie become a team. Few directors and perhaps none working in drama have ever been as good at directing themselves as Eastwood. He has a complete understanding of Eastwood the actors strengths and iconic value but hes seduced by neither. He neither favors himself nor denies himself. Rather he brings out of himself a performance that depicts enduring toughness appalled discovery and touching newfound delicacy. Though the joke about Eastwood is that his face barely moves his has become one of the great expressive faces one that can register shock with the intensity of a man waking up at the Last Judgment and affection with the relief of a man taking off an iron suit. Its not the first word that usually comes to mind with Eastwood but in ""Million Dollar Baby"" he is truly lovely. His scenes with Swank are special and so are his scenes with Freeman. Frankie and Eddie go way back to the days when Eddie was still boxing and theres a shorthand about their interaction as well as a sense of history informing it. Both seem to understand something about life a something that allows Eddie for example to carry himself with dignity even though he lives in one room and doesnt have a dime. Ultimately everyone is defeated but not everyone tries. Theres nobility in the attempt and also in facing the inevitable. -- Advisory This movie contains bloody boxing scenes.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Is Clint Eastwood the Manchurian Candidate? He must be. Brainwashing seems the only plausible explanation for the extraordinary praise given his drab plodding movies. The overdeliberate humorless revenge drama ""Mystic River"" was directed and hailed as if it were Greek tragedy -- and next to Eastwoods new ""Million Dollar Baby"" it is. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is generating astonishing critical word of mouth figuring prominently in the year-end voting for critics awards and winning Eastwood best-directing honors from the New York Film Critics Circle. Have any of the critics praising ""Million Dollar Baby"" actually ever seen another movie -- any movie? A compendium of every cliche from every bad boxing melodrama ever made ""Million Dollar Baby"" (written by Paul Haggis from stories by F.X. Toole) tries to transcend its cornball overfamiliarity with the qualities that have long characterized Eastwoods direction -- its solemn inflated and dull. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn a journeyman boxing trainer who has never gotten a shot at a title. Shortly after the movie begins a boxer who seems to offer Frankie a chance at just that deserts him for another manager. Frankie seems destined to remain stuck in his ratty old Los Angeles gym along with his avuncular sidekick a former boxer named -- no kidding -- Scrap (Morgan Freeman) seemingly to end his days training one second-rater after another. Scrap steers Frankie to Maggie (Hilary Swank) a waitress already in her 30s (in other words an age at which many boxers are starting to think of retiring) who has been haunting the gym diligently if not very skillfully working out. After some persuasion from Maggie Frankie takes her on and she turns out to be a winner bringing Frankie closer and closer to his dream of a shot at a title. Over the course of his career Eastwood has gone from playing the Man with No Name a ""Dont mess with me"" loner to playing a series of sentimentalized old geezers. Frankie is the latest. Theres some unspecified heartbreak in his past involving a daughter he writes to faithfully every week. (The letters are always returned.) And if the alienated daughter and dashed dreams arent enough fodder for the blubber machine theres the thread that runs through the movie of Frankie trying valiantly to hold onto his faith attending Mass every day saying his prayers at night. How can audiences not laugh at the sight of Eastwood moaning and groaning as he drops to his knees to say his bedtime prayers? Its not the act of prayer thats worthy of being laughed at -- its Eastwoods cheap grab at audience sympathy by playing up Frankies aches and pains. Eastwood still in fine condition at 74 wears his pants hiked up so that it looks as if his belt is trying to locate his nipples. ""Million Dollar Baby"" features not just one wise old codger but two. When Eastwood and Morgan Freeman share the screen they act as if theyre in a competition to win the right to be called ""Pops."" (Can remakes of ""West Side Story"" or ""Song of the South"" be far behind?) At least when Burgess Meredith did this stuff in the ""Rocky"" movies he had the good hammy sense to treat it like the hokum it was. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a piece of ham intended for those who keep kosher. Its dried-out humorless achieved grubbiness is meant to purify it to lift it above its melodramatic roots. Eastwoods performance is one long wince and he directs as if it would hurt him to throw in a little lightness a little color one scene that didnt look like it was shot in a gas station bathroom. The alleged cinematography by Tom Stern is a visual insult. At times Stern seems to be trying to see how many different shades of dingy green can fit into one picture. And as almost all of Eastwoods films are the movie is so underlit that you begin wondering if somebody at Warner Bros. forgot to go shopping for light bulbs. Everything about the movie looks and feels irredeemably cheap. A Vegas title fight being telecast on HBO looks like a smoker at a V.A. hall. And though Maggie moves up the ranks of boxing and we hear her talk about getting her picture in magazines we never see a photographer or reporter around her. Eastwood seems to think he can make a title bout look different from the grimy boxing clubs where Maggie fights simply by populating the front rows of the audience with a few sparse extras dressed in gowns or suits. You Might Also Like There are a few crumbs of pleasure a montage of Maggie dispatching one opponent after another with first-round knockouts. The two scenes between Swank and Freeman particularly the one where he trains her to work the punching bag have a nice unforced actors rhythm. And I cherish one shot of Swank sitting in a car at a gas pump giving the full dazzle of her smile to a little girl and her dog across the way. Swank melts you in that moment without any of the scripts phony trumped-up drama. Shes such an unadorned actress that she manages some believability in a contrived role and contrived surroundings. She has to say things like ""Ah dont rahtly know"" and play country polite. (This is a movie in which integrity is measured by a pronunciation like ""Missourah."") You dont buy it but Swank works her tail off and she earns our respect for trying to do honest work. Swank fares better than the fine character actress Margo Martindale stuck in a grotesque role as Maggies freeloading mother and four-time world champion boxer Lucia Rijker appearing as Maggies fiercest opponent and photographed to look like a glowering tranny villain. It becomes increasingly hard for Swank to keep a sense of reality in her performance as the movie grinds on. Maggie undergoes a torrent of physical punishment (you could say shes ""Caviezel-ed"") and the movie takes an outrageous melodramatic -- and wholly unbelievable -- turn. (It depends on a prestige fight being allowed to go on well past the point where it would be stopped. Maybe Eastwood is counting here on the squeamish misconception of boxing as sheer unregulated brutality.) But its the po-faced portentousness with which Eastwood presents the movies ludicrous developments that seems to wow his admirers. The movies are full of examples of directors who have transcended hokey material. But usually those filmmakers do it by going so intensely into the emotions of the piece that (as in Dickens) whats sentimental becomes transcendent. Eastwood takes the opposite approach -- he thinks that he can turn hokeyness into tragedy by pretending that the material isnt hokey by dragging it out and drabbing it down. Eastwood often talks about what he learned from the two directors he is most closely associated with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone. (""Unforgiven"" is dedicated to them.) But he has nothing of Siegels brutal efficiency and none of the expansiveness of Leones crude and lyrical mythmaking. Eastwoods admirers would place him even higher in the pantheon of great American filmmaking next to John Ford and Howard Hawks. That talk has gotten more and more common in critical circles ever since ""Unforgiven"" and it seems to me a real misunderstanding of our movie heritage. There were plenty of cliches in the movies of the great commercial directors of the 30 40s and 50s sometimes because they worked so much sometimes because they were saddled with second-rate material. But those directors also worked to make that material emotionally real to find ways to dress up what was secondhand in the scripts they shot. ""Million Dollar Baby"" pretends to be grounded in a true gritty view of life but everything in it feels lifted from old movies -- the most laughable old movies. (You keep expecting the cast of ""The Carol Burnett Show"" or ""SCTV"" to come in and take over.) Eastwood falls heavily and clumsily over the conventions and cliches that the great Hollywood directors of the past elided and for that obviousness hes hailed as a classicist. Maybe because for his admirers Eastwoods deadening seriousness gives his pictures something like the tone of art films. (I can see the theses now ""The Community as Prison Suspicion and Revenge in Day of Wrath and Mystic River"" or ""Darwinian Dialectic in Every Which Way but Loose."") Many of the scenes between Eastwood and Swank are taken up with her trying to figure out the Gaelic slogan he has chosen for her robe ""Ma Cushla."" (Frankie likes to read Yeats.) The meaning is revealed in the movies big lump-in-the-throat moment. For American critics this Christmas ""Ma Cushla"" has another meaning suckered.

My denouncement was premature. At least three total surprises have suddenly arrived that are intelligent refreshing admirable artistically sound and worthy of the most serious attention. Two of them Spanglish and In Good Company are comedies which shocks me even more; the third Million Dollar Baby is a drama by Clint Eastwood that scales some of the highest dramatic peaks of his career. Two-thirds of Million Dollar Baby makes for the best boxing movie since Raging Bull. Then it takes an electrifying left turn and the final third of the movie gets even better surpassing Martin Scorseses 1980 epic with the kind of burning humanity it never managed to achieve. Women who want to beat each other to death are in my opinion sick sisters who substitute bloody violence for everything important missing in their lives. But Maggie Fitzgerald the disenfranchised Irish trailer-trash waitress that Hilary Swank plays to the ultimate power in Million Dollar Baby is obsessed with the courage and determination to be somebody even if wearing boxing gloves is the only way she knows how to do it. The first day she wanders into Clint Eastwoods ratty gym the rejection is wounding. Hes Frankie Dunn a trainer who has in his day managed some human tractors in the ring. Cold and callused now hes distanced himself from people to the point of emotional anesthesia. Still he attends Mass every day tortured by guilt and self-reproach and hides a cache of unopened letters that have been returned by an estranged daughter he deserted 23 years ago. All he wants in a world of superficial relationships and phony values is to be left alone to search for simple pleasures like a hard-to-find perfect lemon pie made from scratch. The only person who understands what makes him tick is a janitor named Scrap (Morgan Freeman). Into this coven of has-beens from Hell Maggie spends all of her tips to prove shes got what it takes to be a champ. At 32 shes old to train with a brother in prison a sister on welfare and a 300-pound mother who treats her like a syphilis epidemic. Fighting is the only thing that makes her feel alive. ""Tough aint enough"" says Mr. Eastwood with a voice like tires spinning on trap rock. But there is something about this waif. As it turns out tough is just for starters. She fulfills his definition of a great fighter-shes willing to endure the cracked ribs ruptured kidneys and detached retinas to live a dream nobody else understands-but she has a heart and when they learn to trust each other he finds his too. With its gritty performances its ringside corruption and its lowlife integrity Million Dollar Baby builds muscle in the tradition of those formulaic boxing movies in the 1940s written by Ring Lardner Jr. or Abraham Polonsky the story of a poor misfit with nothing to lose who makes good in the ring forsakes a normal life for the love of a burned-out mentor then loses everything anyway while he finds his soul. For the meatiest part of the film Clint Eastwoods brilliant direction in the lurid style and realism of John Hustons Fat City is a grim moment-by-moment knockout-by-knockout manual on how to move how to pace how to book fights how to lose and how to win. Once the battered cynical Frankie sees how indestructible his pupil is his reserve cracks and he starts to feel untapped emotions of respect and awe. Once in a while Mr. Eastwood also allows a glimpse into the characters inner secrets Frankies storage box of return-to-sender letters Maggies loyalty in refusing to sign with a better-connected manager. But this is not a movie about emotions and it is never remotely sentimental. Based on stories from F.X. Tooles acclaimed book Rope Burns the two-fisted script by Paul Haggis has a violent and bloody lyricism about the lexicon of pugilism. When Maggies fearlessness eventually breaks the rules Frankie has taught her one mistake in the ring leads to near-fatal repercussions that end her career uniting them in a different kind of fight; they are a bitter old man who has lost his only daughter and a young woman in need of a surrogate father in an unconventional relationship with rules of its own. In the end a girl who has always made vital decisions about life makes the ultimate decision about death and a man who has always had problems with God is forced to test the limits of faith. For Hilary Swank this movie is an endurance test that pays off with astounding power. Sinewy and lean her lovely face tightened over picket-fence teeth that flash in breathless smiles she radiates optimism in a grim wasteland of dirty bars and cruel ringside cheers where death and glory are the same thing. Mr. Eastwoods concentrated direction is matched by a focalized performance intense enough to cause a hernia. In a fadeout I will never forget he vanishes from society and sits alone hunched over the perfect lemon pie with natural ingredients silhouetted in the window of an Edward Hopper diner. Million Dollar Baby is an unsettling and unforgettable masterpiece of skid-row poetry that punctures the heart. Gracias Mr. Sandler Before I saw Spanglish if you told me I would apply the word ""enchanting"" to any film starring Adam Sandler I would have challenged you to a duel in the middle of Times Square. Here is an actor to whom I have always been allergic. His droning voice and deadly personality could put goldfish to sleep. But in this exemplary film by the great James L. Brooks he is just the opposite of the nuked techno-geeks he usually plays in pretentious bores like Punch-Drunk Love. In fact as the bewildered husband and father in a Beverly Hills household that is coming unglued by the micro-minute he is honest understated and sympathetic enough to actually resemble a real live human being. Of course this is not an Adam Sandler movie. He is a significant contributor to a hard-working dedicated ensemble; he holds up his end of the equation nobly. A lot of the credit must go to Mr. Brooks whose maturity as a writer and sensitive handling of actors in such films as Terms of Endearment Broadcast News and As Good as It Gets have often led to Oscars. Mr. Sandler is in good hands. He serves the material not the other way around. And this is material worth serving. Spanglish examines the L.A. culture-collision between affluent employers and their ethnic servants from the perspective of clashing values and changing mores with a witty perceptive and touching respect for the differences that set people apart and force them back together under the same social umbrella. Paz Vega the gorgeous star of Pedro Almodovars Talk to Her makes her American film debut as Flor a hard-working single mother from the Mexican slums who has immigrated to California to provide a better life for her teenage daughter. Flors biggest break after years of struggle comes out of the blue when she applies for a job as a housekeeper in the Clasky home and gets hired on the spot by the loopy stressed-out Deb Clasky (Tea Leoni) a spoiled bleach-blond Beverly Hills housewife in the middle of an identity crisis who can scarcely organize a cup of organic tea without hysteria much less get her children off to school. What Flor innocently walks into is Mount St. Helens ready to erupt. In addition to the beautiful but unhinged Deb the terminally frazzled Claskys also include husband John (Adam Sandler) an uber-chef on the rise who lives in mortal fear of the restaurant critic for the L. A. Times overweight teenage daughter Bernie troubled 9-year-old son George who suffers from nightmares and Debs mother Evelyn (hilariously played by the great Cloris Leachman). Evelyn is a dipsomaniac who used to be a cherished jazz singer from the June Christy ""cool school"" in her salad days. No family ever had a grandmother like Evelyn. When little George has one of his bad dreams Grandma teaches him a new song. Not ""Itsy-Bitsy Spider"" or ""Three Blind Mice""- her kind of songs. Until you see a 9-year-old boy singing ""Lush Life"" you dont know what fresh laughter is. Since Flor doesnt speak one word of English everyone in the house communicates in ""Spanglish"" the hybrid lingo 90 percent of all assimilated Latinos in the American work force speak in order to survive with Flors daughter Cristina acting as interpreter and the results are a Tower of Babble. When Flor secretly reaches for her sewing kit to let out Bernie Claskys clothes from the torturous smaller sizes her mom buys to humiliate her into losing weight a loving rapport develops between the maid and her employers kid that feeds Debs inferiority complex even more. Then they move to Malibu (""Gods private toy store for the rich"" observes Cristina) where Deb takes an inappropriate interest in Cristinas education applying for a scholarship to a private school that Flor cannot afford injuring her pride. Dad gets his first four-star review Deb has a brief affair that endangers the marriage Flor finds herself reluctantly filling gaps and providing warmth and affection against her better judgment. Two cultures converge in the same house with everyone getting involved in the tensions and conflicts; its like a munitions factory waiting for someone to light a match. Somethings gotta give before a lot of nice people do irreparable damage that can never be reversed and the ways Mr. Brooks leads them all to adulthood are sweet moving and genuinely funny. The actors are superb. As Flor the housekeeper no sane person should be without Ms. Vega is a sensational find-a beautiful newcomer who ignites the screen. Mr. Sandler is something of a miracle. And the movie says something valid about the disparate but life-enriching lifestyles that are forcing Americans to live and love and grow in better ways every day-and not just in Southern California. Spanglish soars triumphantly above most American comedies with no nudity sex obscenity or violence and still manages to touch every trigger point in the human heart. Its another movie about a dysfunctional family but this one is different because theyre original lovable forgivable and fascinating. The Price of Things In the structured and predictable architecture of contrived American comedies In Good Company is a welcome bas relief from the literate gifted and responsible young writer-director Paul Weitz. Addressing a vicious age in which the movers and shakers of capitalist greed know the price of all things and the value of nothing at all Mr. Weitz has constructed a clever pungent and ironic tale of misguided corporate power that is both sad and hilarious at the same time. In another charming and three-dimensional essay on American males growing increasingly extinct in their own jungle the increasingly charismatic but weirdly undervalued Dennis Quaid plays the revered head of ad sales for a sports magazine whose 23-year tenure is suddenly threatened by a corporate takeover demoted authority and a new boss young enough to be his son (Topher Grace). A 51-year-old achiever with a 26-year-old boss is bad enough but now his own daughter a creative-writing major at N.Y.U (Scarlett Johansson) falls for his new office rival and his wife (the fabulous Marg Helgenberger) is unexpectedly pregnant with a new baby-just when retirement finally beckons. Things couldnt look worse for a 51-year-old dinosaur who hates sushi eschews the idea of luring clients with P.R. cocktail parties for rappers and Bill Clinton and still believes that people are more important than demographics. Since Mr. Weitzs sterling-silver screenplay is cliche-resistant no corporate zombie is what he seems on the surface. Topher Grace seems to be in the catbird seat with his snappy computer-speak irritating energy and blue status-symbol Porsche but he has his own problems. Hes desperate for control in the boardroom but is so lonely in the bedroom that he starts sleeping on his own office sofa at night to keep from going home to an empty apartment. So we have all of the ingredients for a Fred MacMurray sitcom the old-timer who is adored by his entire staff but old-fashioned when it comes to modern corporate overkill versus the cold impersonal kid who knows technology but has no people skills. The film is so smart that nothing remains even everyone changes and everything ends in logic instead of Hollywood smile buttons. The acting is uniformly crisp and never top-heavy the situations are believable and the laughs are rooted in reality. This is the hardest kind of comedy to play and the kind at which Dennis Quaid is as natural as breathing. In Good Company is also that rare kind of movie that uses a familiar theme (office politics on the ruthless scale of corporate greed) and says something vital pertinent cogent and fresh about the subject. This movie has nuance insight and a maturity beyond the years of its wonderful young director. At a time when companies are downsizing scaling away cutting back and selling off everything in the office for profit so fast that nobody dares to go to the mens room In Good Company also has a positive way of saying patience is its own reward. Big business is like New York weather When things look bleak just wait around long enough and everything will change. Paul Weitz is the grandson of the legendary agent Paul Kohner whose clients included Billy Wilder John Huston and Ingmar Bergman. His parents are the luminous actress Susan Kohner and fashion designer-novelist John Weitz. Some genes. Sanity is making a comeback like good movies. Is it any surprise that he has plenty of both?

Wallace A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The last time Hilary Swank donned sweatpants and boxing gloves she was 19 years old and playing the title role in The Next Karate Kid the instantly forgettable (and instantly forgotten) entry in that overextended franchise. Now shes another title-card fighter and even those who saw Swanks Oscar-winning performance as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena in Boys Dont Cry may have a tough time recognizing her in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald. Her hair pulled back her eyes concentrated into a catlike stare her body springy and lithe shes a bundle of fearsome energy as she sits in her corner of the ring eager to take on her next opponent.She doesnt start out that way. When Maggie first stumbles into the Hit Pit Gym shes scrawny and unformed a determined young woman who has spent most of her adult life trying to outrun her hillbilly past only to find that its still right there over her shoulder. Its her trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who has boxing in his blood. And Maggies not leaving until he teaches her a thing or two.Million Dollar Baby is that rare boxing movie thats as much about the agony of defeat -- in all its myriad forms -- as it is about the thrill of victory. Its a movie that lives and breathes and hurts and bleeds right along with its characters knowing that sometimes the deepest wounds are the ones that cant be seen. In adapting the short story of the same title by the pseudonymous F.X. Toole screenwriter Paul Haggis has allowed characters from other Toole stories to float in and out of the action including the one-eyed ex-fighter Scrap (Morgan Freeman) to whom Haggis has assigned narrator duties and whose wizened observations carry the warm familiarity of a crackling fire on a cold winters night. The result is a deeply knowing study of families abandoned and found battles won and lost dreams realized and deferred. All peeling paint and tattered equipment the Hit Pit itself -- a massive set built from the ground up by veteran production designer Henry Bumstead -- is a place where The Iceman Comeths Harry Hope might have felt at home in the company of other specters of a bygone era. But it is Eastwood himself who has built Million Dollar Baby along the clean classical lines of a 1930s Hollywood melodrama only to guide us through trap doors and dark passages we had no reason to expect were there.MILLION DOLLAR BABY | Directed by CLINT EASTWOOD | Written by PAUL HAGGIS from stories by F.X.

Like his spaghetti Western heroes did to the last pistolero of the day he has gunned down every preconception about him. Sweet science Clint Eastwood is the trainer and Hilary Swank is the fighter. Warner Bros. Yet here he is still reinventing himself with Million Dollar Baby (    out of four) a grim knockout of a boxing movie with multiple jolts. (Related video Watch the Million Dollar Baby trailer) Eastwood directs and stars in one of his top performances not as the boxer obviously but as a gym operator. With still-imposing biceps and a gruff voice he has the authority to make us follow his lead yet the character is not without flaws. Weekly letters to an estranged daughter get returned. And hes so confrontational to a much younger priest during daily visits to church that the clearly exasperated cleric finally declares ""Dont come to Mass tomorrow."" Still viewers will find his grumpiness agreeable and we understand why a waitress played heartbreakingly by Hilary Swank wants him to train her. Nearly out of options as she pushes 32 Swanks character is upfront about her trashy upbringing although when we finally see her kin in two unforgettable scenes she comes off as a master of understatement. Eastwood wants nothing to do with female boxers but fate a personal liking for the woman who calls him ""boss"" and some unrestrained prodding combine to change his mind. The prodding comes from a one-eyed gym live-in (Morgan Freeman) who in his own fighting days used Eastwood as a cut man. They have their own sad history but they get along so well they can needle each other incessantly without hitting sore nerves. As Swank starts piling up surprise wins and self-esteem you sense the movie is heading somewhere. Though the destination isnt clear the principals are photographed in the kind of expressionistic shadows that suggest a Rocky redux wont be forthcoming. Great scene follows great scene taking the movie to fresh levels. Among masterful sequences are Swanks discomforting first reunion with her family and Freeman taking matters into his own hands with some of the buffed rabble that hangs around the gym. Swank hasnt been the easiest actress to cast since her Boys Dont Cry Oscar but this performance will clear all doubts of one-hit-wonderdom -- not in the least because she convinces in the fight scenes and is in spectacularly credible shape. Boxing at its best can be exhilarating. So is seeing as we did a couple of Decembers ago with Robert Altman and Gosford Park a filmmaker in his 70s firing on all cylinders. Better than last years Mystic River which may have been mildly overrated Million Dollar Baby is as good as Unforgiven. Or to put it another way as good as any movie Eastwood has ever directed.

Running time 132 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence disturbing images profanity). At the Lincoln Square and the Angelika. CLINT Eastwood scores a knockout as an actor and director with ""Million Dollar Baby"" a spare exquisitely realized masterpiece about faith redemption and boxing that beautifully illustrates his longtime philosophy that ""less is more."" In the most heartfelt and layered performance of his long career Eastwood is grizzled perfection as Frankie Dunn a veteran fight trainer who very reluctantly takes on his first ""girlie"" even though he considers Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) at 31 way too old to start training for a title bout. Frankie who owns a rundown gym in downtown L.A. shuns emotional contact with people because of his longtime estrangement from his daughter. The cause of their rift - which Frankie has tried to heal with a stack of letters all returned unread - is wisely never specified but Frankie has attended Mass every day for 23 years even as he constantly debates the meaning of faith with the priest (Brian OByrne). Frankies only friend is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (a superb Morgan Freeman who also narrates) a one-eyed former boxer of Frankies who runs the gym - and with whom Frankie incessantly (and often hilariously) spars verbally like an old married couple. After the latest of a long line of boxing proteges leaves Frankie because of the old mans reluctance to arrange a title match - and following much nudging by Scrap - Frankie starts training Maggie. Shes a waitress living on table scraps who is burning for a shot to leave behind the poverty of her native Ozarks. Maggie turns out to be a natural in the ring quickly triumphing in a series of expertly staged bouts in the United States and Europe (which Eastwood economically represents with a single stock shot of London). Eastwood has long loved to confound audience expectations though - and this is no crowd-pleasing female version of ""Rocky"" much less a lark like Eastwoods hugely popular 70s forays into the sweet science ""Any Which Way But Loose"" and ""Any Which Way You Can."" Just as Frankie and Maggie have formed a tight father-daughter bond that fills the voids in their lives tragedy strikes a lethal blow at them in Las Vegas. Frankie is faced with an agonizing choice - one that may provide his long-suffering soul with an act of contrition. Swank outdoes her Oscar-winning work in ""Boys Dont Cry"" as Maggie whose grit and determination to succeed is explained when we meet her greedy trailer-trash mother (Margo Martindale) and family in two heartbreaking scenes. Perhaps the most pungent and authentic boxing movie since ""Champion"" the riveting elegiac and eloquent script is by veteran TV writer Paul Haggis based on stories by veteran fight trainer Jerry Boyd (writing as F.X. Toole). Eastwood whose direction of ""Mystic River"" was uncharacteristically emotionally flamboyant returns to his usual highly effective minimalist style with ""Million Dollar Baby"" both as a director as an actor (as well as the composer of the subtly haunting score and the films producer). His haunted Frankie Dunn is a character every bit as unforgettable as Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name - he should start clearing lots of room on his mantel come Oscar time.

(ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURES ARTS /EPA) BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 15 2004 1200 AM It is Clint Eastwoods baby in every respect - a movie that approaches the level of great boxing films like ""Raging Bull"" by using sport as a metaphor for human nature. ""Million Dollar Baby"" however does not use the typical boxing formula of training montages leading to a foregone triumph. Instead it delves into emotionally fraught territory and forces its characters to make decisions for which no sport can prepare them. The movie features three actors in fighting form Eastwood giving the most emotionally naked performance of his constantly surprising career; the reliable Morgan Freeman as narrator and Eastwoods foil and Hilary Swank undergoing another physical transformation as impressive as her gender switch in ""Boys Dont Cry."" Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn the grizzled owner of a downscale boxing gym. Membership is spotty but the place is crowded with ghosts of Frankies past - he has somehow alienated his grown daughter and marinates in guilt over an ancient boxing debacle. In fact the gym is a refuge and holding pen for lost and lonely people who wish for things theyre no longer likely to get. As a sometime manager (he was dumped by his last client played by handsome newcomer Mike Colter) and former ""cut man"" Frankie is immersed in a risk-taking sport but avoids risk completely. Frankies virtual limbo finds expression in hollow visits to church and a lack of connection. Who better to shake him up than Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) a scrappy dirt-poor wanna-be? Already pushing her luck at 31 she is so hungry for training that she practically lives at the gym gobbling up stray bits of advice. Frankie wont train ""girlies"" - ""Tough aint enough"" - but this girlie hangs in there until he caves in. Thus begins an avuncular relationship that fills the gaps in their lives. The New York Daily News published this article on Dec. 15 2004. (New York Daily News) Clearly Swank trained hard for this role (at Gleasons Gym in Brooklyn) - and sports a flat slab of muscle flanking her six-pack abs. But she also gives Maggie a fascinating mix of attributes including hairpin turns from tough to giddy and a wry wit that meshes well with Frankie and with Eddie (Freeman) a former boxer who is Frankies right-hand man. ""To make a fighter you gotta strip em down to bare wood"" says Eddie in a narration that serves as a kind of campfire story of guts and heroism. The excellent script by Paul Haggis is adapted from the short-story collection in ""Rope Burns"" by F.X. Toole. It gives the actors room to stretch out and solidify the relationship among their characters who joke gossip and get on each others nerves - but they cant survive without each other. Late in life Eastwood has become one of our finest directors. Here he turns in a rare performance as well. Were in his corner.

Liam Lacey From Wednesdays Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 15 2004 734AM EST Last updated Thursday Apr. 09 2009 124AM EDT Comments AA Million Dollar Baby Directed by Clint Eastwood Written by Paul Haggis Starring Clint Eastwood Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank Classification PG Rating  Clint Eastwoods new boxing movie is like a title bout that goes through seven rounds of friendly push and poke before exploding into a knockout combination. The viewer is lulled into a false sense of security and ends up bruised and stunned. Some viewers may even feel sucker-punched by the narrative twist though thats not Eastwoods intent. As with last years Mystic River his aim is to chart the ironies that fall between dreams and consequences. Compared to the solemnity of Mystic River Million Dollar Baby initially feels comic. The script by Canadian TV writer Paul Haggis (whose directing debut Crash will be released next year) is based on a short story by F.X. Toole from his collection Rope Burns Tales of the Corner. For at least the first two acts of its clear three-act structure Million Dollar Baby plays like an old-fashioned hackneyed fight fable in the Rocky tradition A washed-up fight manager rediscovers his purpose in life through a disadvantaged kid with the outsized heart and a hammer for a left hook. With his trademark spare unfussy direction and jumping into the story approach Eastwood subtly establishes the themes of faith loss and love and then he raises the drama to a different level. He also stars in the film as an old boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn. Most of the action takes place in his well-worn gym called the Hit Pit somewhere in Los Angeles. The story is partly told in a gravelly voice-over by the clubs janitor a former fighter called Scrap (Morgan Freeman). Boxing says Scrap is about respect Getting it for yourself and taking it away from someone else. Scrap lost an eye years before when Frankie was his corner man. Together they work side by side like an old married couple mixing bickering affection with sharp barbs. The Hit Pit is a shrine to faded glories. The colour palette emphasizes wan yellows browns and pale blues as if its last paint job hasnt been freshened in 40 years. Even the characters seem like stock types from some 1940s fight film. The story concerns Frankies emotional rebirth when he is persuaded to train Maggie (Hilary Swank) a young waitress from a poor Ozark background who is for private reasons determined to learn to fight. His Million Dollar Baby becomes both a surrogate daughter and a potential champion. Swank whose best performance was her Oscar-winner in Boys Dont Cry again captures that quality of radiant childlike trust. She calls Frankie ""boss"" and his eventual devotion to her is entirely paternal. Though ornery and isolated Frankie shows a few signs that theres more to him than meets the eye. He makes a daily visit to mass mostly to annoy the priest about matters of doctrine. The priest who tells him not to bother coming provokes him back by asking about his estranged daughter. Frankie has no other family but he is struggling to connect to his Irish roots by learning Gaelic and reading the poetry of Yeats. When Frankie tells his fighters ""Always protect yourself"" hes also reciting his private mantra for keeping guilt and fear away. As a manager its limiting. Early in the film his prize contender ditches him because of Frankies reluctance to give him a title shot. Then Maggie enters the picture and his hard shell is vulnerable. After an extended cat-and-mouse game where Maggie pushes to have Frankie become her manager and he resists he finally decides to help her out. After training her he begins gingerly to arrange some bouts. In a series of comically short matches she swarms her opponents winning most fights by knockout in the first round. Then in a rapid succession of scenes she goes to Europe to fight a series of matches. She returns to the United States a contender and a major draw. Gradually we learn about what makes Maggie fight so hard. She has spent her life as Scrap tells us being told shes ""trash"" coming from an Ozark family of welfare cheaters jailbirds and social parasites. (The family when they appear seem grotesque and cartoonish a low blow in a film that focuses on human dignity.) Maggies breath-taking rise through the ranks strains credibility as the story pushes forward into the third act but the sense of remorseless energy sets us up for the finale. Not much can be said about the third act of Million Dollar Baby without compromising its impact but its a demonstration of why Eastwood has come to be one of the most venerated of American directors. Essentially the ending is like a musical movement that recapitulates and deepens the established themes in a new darker key. Eastwood who has forged his limited expressiveness into a concise style acts with moving understatement in the final scenes steering close but staying clear of outright sentimentality. As with his direction his performance is a study in saying more with less.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Morgan Freeman Hilary Swank Clint Eastwood or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Million Dollar Baby"" has one of the worst titles Ive heard in awhile. Its a film set in the boxing world but the title makes it sound like a Busby Berkeley musical.But its also quite simply one of the best films of the year -- or the last few years for that matter.The film works on every level -- acting direction and production -- as it tells its heartfelt story about human frailty and the power of redemption.So dont let the title get in the way. Indeed ""Million Dollar Baby"" is destined to cause a feeding frenzy among Academy Awards voters. I expect it will be nominated in every top category except best supporting actress and only because the film doesnt have a role fitting that slot.(Its already earned several honors including five Golden Globe nominations and placement on several critics top 10 lists.)Clint Eastwood as gym owner and boxing manager Frankie Dunn and Morgan Freeman as former fighter and gym manager Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris deliver their best performances in very long time. Eastwood in particular hasnt grabbed the screen so totally since ""Unforgiven."" And Hilary Swanks knockout (sorry) portrayal of boxer Maggie Fitzgerald is tailor-made for Oscar.BelieversThe movie begins with Fitzgerald walking into the Hit Pit a seedy gym in downtown L.A. that matches Dunns leathery world-weary face. Her goal is not only to become a champion in the world of female boxing but also to get Dunn to become her mentor coach and manager.Dunn has other ideas. First female boxing is beneath him. Second at the age of 31 he thinks Fitzgerald is too old to begin a career in the ring. Then too Dunn is fighting his own personal demons as he faces the end of his career. He doesnt need the added baggage. Everybody -- Eastwood Swank and Morgan Freeman -- gives terrific performances says critic Paul Clinton.The only person who remotely believes in Fitzgeralds dream is Dupris -- known throughout the film as Scrap. This onetime fighter sidelined by injury gently encourages her while steadily throwing her in Dunns path in hopes of getting his friends attention.On the surface this rookie-seeking-a mentor-setup sounds like numerous other plotlines in numerous other films over the years -- boxing films in particular. But what sets this story apart is the remarkable journey these three deeply flawed characters eventually take over the course of the film. The finely crafted script by Paul Haggis -- based on short stories from the collection ""Rope Burns"" by F.X. Toole -- is multi-layered and sharply observant.You have to only look back one year to Eastwoods last stunning achievement ""Mystic River"" to confirm that the filmmaker loves stories dealing with second chances and human redemption. With ""Million Dollar Baby"" this Hollywood veteran has once again found material allowing him to rip away the facade of his characters and expose the raw emotions beneath the surface.Priceless workSwank confirms that her amazing work in ""Boys Dont Cry"" was no fluke. Shes a gritty actress and she shows real depth -- and an uncanny ability to get into the heart of her character. She inhabits the role with grace style and intelligence.Eastwood and Freeman are a joy to watch together. Nothing gets past them; they can convey volumes with just a movement or glance. Seeing them on screen is like attending a master class in the art of acting.And Eastwood remains one of the finest directors working today. He pulls the best from his actors; the economy of his directing style is unparalleled. There isnt one wasted frame of film and his simple use of fades to black between scenes allows the story to flow seamlessly.Creating his own soundtracks has become a signature for Eastwoods films and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is no exception. Like his direction the music supports the story at every turn. The score -- simple and unadorned -- mirrors both the script and the direction.""Million Dollar Baby"" is a profound testament to the idea that sometimes the families we make along the way in life are the real ties that bind. The best love is earned.And so is the respect accorded to the best movies. ""Million Dollar Baby"" earns that too.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

By David Denby Howard Hughes the billionaire madman the taloned hermit of Las Vegas eating nothing but steak and peas and guarding his sealed penthouse in shoes made of Kleenex boxes--that was the pop-culture lunatic the haggard face in the tabloids we knew in the years before his death in 1976. Martin Scorseses brilliantly entertaining ""The Aviator"" goes back before that period to the years when Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a handsome and flamboyant young man. In 1924 at the age of eighteen Hughes inherited a fortune that his father had made in the Houston oil business and by the time he was twenty-two (when the movie picks up his story) he was already a brash player in the countrys two hottest industries--aviation still in its daredevil phase and Hollywood at the end of the silent period when people making movies realized with a happy sigh that the pleasant job of entertaining a nation came with a lot of easy sex. Hughes produced and directed pictures designed and flew airplanes slept with dozens of beautiful starlets and actresses. The movie is a fantasia about a studly capitalist prince--a fantasia darkened at the end in the nineteen-forties by ghoulish intimations of the bad times to come. ""The Aviator"" I suppose is Scorseses ""Citizen Kane"" but its a portrait made without Welless malicious satirical spirit. The movie is not an expose of Hughes (whats left to expose?) but a rehabilitation and celebration. Recovering from the grisly street theatrics of ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese working with the screenwriter John Logan invites us to enter the dream life of the nation the silver single-wing airplane that Hughes creates in the thirties with its narrow tubelike fuselage is a chic vision of elegance; the aerial sequences enhanced by digital painting frankly acknowledge our desire for beauty and rapturous excess in the sky. As his camera swoops down from the ceiling in the lost-in-wonder style of old movie musicals Scorsese returns again and again to his re-creation of the Cocoanut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel a movie-titan playland adorned by willing playmates. Hughes seduces a cigarette girl by slipping his hand under her spangled tutu. Errol Flynn (Jude Law) stumbles in drunkenly and makes lewd remarks which depresses the young Howard who is certainly interested in sex but dislikes loose talk. In his middle twenties Hughes is an arrogant but appealing plutocrat who does everything by instinct. Always in motion he hires and fires people on the spot. He throws millions into his aerial-warfare epic ""Hells Angels"" then reshoots most of it when sound comes in. Wearing a Stetson instead of a hood and goggles he tests his own aircraft and gets so giddy when aloft that he twice runs out of fuel. The first time he crash-lands harmlessly in a beet field. The second he shears off the tops of houses in Beverly Hills panicking the people making lunch in their kitchens below. The sequence which seems prolonged well beyond real time by Scorseses amazement is actually quite funny--up to its flaming end that is when Hughes nearly dies. In a burst of awed amusement Scorsese hypes his subject and I trust that no one will take the narrative as literal truth. For instance did Hughes really decide in an instant to buy a majority shareholders position in T.W.A.? Whats important is that the hero looks like a hero Scorsese and the production designer Dante Ferretti press the young tycoon into the svelte Art Deco motifs of the period and Hughes in tuxedos and casual beige flying duds becomes the pictorial embodiment of restless bravado. He never utters an interesting sentence--when hes not talking about airplanes hes barely articulate--but his speedy grasp of the industrial future and his willingness to act on what he foresees are a form of wit. DiCaprio in pomaded and severely parted black hair has the smile and flashing eyes for Hughess more vaunting moments. Yet he portrays this blinkered egotist without displaying any narcissism of his own. He keeps a firm grip on the characters inner terrors--his habit of receding into himself his appalling torments and phantoms his weirdly impersonal relations with women. Hughes is attracted to the movie-star glow of the young Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and has an affair with her but he doesnt show the slightest interest in who she is as a person or in what shes doing as an actress. Blanchetts angular bones conform at slightly different angles from Hepburns but she does a nervy high-spirited imitation of the Hepburn manner--the forced laugh and toss of the head the stentorian declarations the mixture of ardent sympathy and calculating ambition. Apart from a few romantic moments and a scene in which Hepburn tells Hughes that they must shield their eccentricities from the public they never quite mesh. Its Scorsese and Logans point that Hughes never meshed with anyone. As he gets older he builds unflyable airplanes and periodically withdraws bearded and naked into his germ-haunted paranoia. Meanwhile a pair of tormentors try to move in for the kill--Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) the head of T.W.A.s rival airline Pan American and Trippes flunky the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who investigates contracts that Hughes held with the government during the war. Theres an air of valedictory sadness about Hughess successful 1947 appearance before Brewsters committee--its the last moment were meant to feel in which he is completely on top of his game. In a heroic age the gods might have taken him when he was still young; in the media age he lived on for decades as a comic grotesque. ""The Aviator"" superbly demonstrates with abundant humor and obvious sympathy that this very odd bird once soared on golden wings. The best boxing movies--Robert Rossens ""Body and Soul"" (1947) John Hustons ""Fat City"" (1972) Scorseses ""Raging Bull"" (1980)--have a special redolence that is as easily recognizable and as richly satisfying as the leather-and-manure aroma of a stable. If you hang out in a place like that you love the stink. Most of the characters in Clint Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"" which joins the honor list of great fight films live in a sweat-stained Los Angeles gym known as the Hit Pit. Time has stopped in this downtown relic where encrusted veterans train a few serious fighters and many hapless punks all of them clamoring for a match. ""Boxing is about respect"" someone says--respect wrung from endless curdled jokes. You had your chance you blew it but at least you were lucky enough to get a chance--thats the kind of respect you get at the Hit Pit where the morose sarcasm is softened only by the harshest pity. The hero of the movie which was adapted by the screenwriter Paul Haggis from a story in F. X. Tooles ""Rope Burns"" is Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) a fight manager with guilty memories of mismanaged fights. Dunn who owns the gym was once a ""cut man""--the guy who stanches the flow of blood between rounds with adrenaline chloride and Q-Tips and keeps the fight going. Thats what the movie is about--how you keep going when all youve got is the memory of hope. Frankies partner at the gym is Scrap (Morgan Freeman) an ex-fighter with one functioning eye. Having worked together for decades Frankie and Scrap rag each other in affectionately nasty deadpan exchanges Eastwood in his hoarsely fluent croak Freeman in his noble baritone. Scrap is the first to notice a tough country woman hanging out at the gym--Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who whomps the heavy bag with rhythmless ardor. Swank has a big downturned mouth that brightens into a toothy smile and the kind of bottom-dog gumption thats hard to say no to. Her Maggie wants to be trained by Frankie who despite urging from Scrap resists her--he doesnt train girls and he doesnt want an emotional connection with anyone. All this changes of course and ""Million Dollar Baby"" takes an inspirational almost miraculous turn as Maggie under Frankies tutelage becomes the most skillful fighter in the sordid but lucrative world of womens boxing. The movies emotional transactions are borderline trite Frankie miserably estranged from his own daughter will melt and fall in (paternal) love with his new fighter. Maggie who describes herself as ""trailer trash from the Ozarks"" will get her shot at the title and redeem a family life of mortifying squalor. But Eastwood and Freeman together absolve ""Million Dollar Baby"" of easy sentiment. Freeman narrates in acrid tones and as he talks we realize that the story is something told a bit of a fable a tall tale even and more moving for that. And Eastwood while going beyond his usual glare and wince doles out his feelings slowly parsimoniously with powerful restraint. The movie turns again this time toward disaster but holds to fight-world stoicism right down to the last shot. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has a beautifully modulated sadness thats almost musical. Eastwood once made a movie about Charlie Parker (""Bird"") but this picture has the smoothly melancholic tones of Coleman Hawkins at his greatest. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) the Rwandan manager of the four-star Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali wears a suit and tie and is very polite even deferential to everyone. He works for a Belgian company that owns the hotel which has become an oasis for Europeans and for African elites. A clever proud and opportunistic charmer not always truthful Paul the hero of the stirring ""Hotel Rwanda"" relies on a complicated system of local payoffs favors and strategic friendships to run the hotel. When the Hutu massacres of the Tutsi minority begin in the spring of 1994 Paul the perfect employee works his contacts and keeps the Mille Collines open. But on the sly he makes it a haven for both Hutu and Tutsi fugitives keeping them momentarily safe from the machete-wielding militia who kill eight hundred thousand people in a few weeks. ""Hotel Rwanda"" which was written by Keir Pearson and Terry George who also directed is the true story of a brave and wily man who never made a speech or indulged an instant of stiff-backed righteousness. The fascination of the movie lies in watching this unspectacular mild-tempered fellow outwit some of the worst thugs and profiteers who ever managed to deliver their own country into disaster. Working in Rwanda and South Africa George has put together a large-scale production. He convincingly stages the horrors outside the hotel--the paralyzing fear in the night the vilely inciting radio broadcasts the anguished ineffectiveness of the United Nations the chaos and arbitrary madness of slaughter. But the dramatic life of ""Hotel Rwanda"" is centered in the character of Paul Rusesabagina. Abandoned in a crisis by the Europeans--the people he has always catered to--Paul though increasingly desperate holds to his temperamental equanimity his belief in civility. Violence for him would be a defeat. The film turns into a triumph for Don Cheadle who never steps outside the character for emotional grandstanding or easy moralism. In all I can hardly think of another movie in which sheer intelligence and decency have been made to seem so attractive or effective.

"Clint Eastwood scores a knockout with dark `Baby - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Clint Eastwood scores a knockout with dark `Baby`MILLION DOLLAR BABY (star)(star)(star)(star)December 17 2004|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.""Million Dollar Baby""--with Clint Eastwood as director-producer and lead actor--is a pungent boxing drama with a delayed-action wallop. The movie fools you. Starting out as if it were another ""Rocky""-style Cinderella story with Hilary Swank (""Boys Dont Cry"") as ring hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald ""Baby"" suddenly switches gears and turns dark and heartbreaking in its final act.The source of Paul Haggis script is a story by ""F.X. Toole"" pseudonym of the late fight manager/cut man Jerry Boyd. Eastwood plays a cut man here ring-savvy Frankie Dunn who runs a little L.A. gym and occasionally manages fighters including Maggie. Alienated from his daughter haunted by failures in the ring--including damage to best buddy Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) who narrates the movie--Frankie seems to find redemption and a symbolic father-daughter relationship guiding Maggie toward a title shot.""Baby"" has the taut grim cold look of a noir out of time. It becomes a classic Eastwood movie and Frankie becomes a classic Eastwood role.Right up to and beyond its sudden plunge into darkness ""Million Dollar Baby"" achieves a mellowness and melancholy that recalls the jazzy dissonance of director Eastwoods best work. As for actor Eastwood its a pleasure to see how in maturity he still commands the screen so effortlessly still makes his co-workers shine and as always delivers in the last rounds.----------""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Clint Eastwood Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.

Viewers who like virginal movie experiences should proceed at their own risk. What a marvelous return to form Clint Eastwood has made following the disaster of Blood Work. In fact one could argue that his two most recent films Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby have ushered in the most dramatically compelling phase of Eastwoods long career in front of and behind the camera. Its difficult to say which of these two magnificent films is more powerful - both left me stunned and haunted and both evidence only the tiniest of flaws. Mystic River captured a place in my Top 10 list of 2003; Million Dollar Baby will find a spot on the 2004 roster. Some movies regardless of whether they are seen in January June or December stand out as sure-fire candidates for end-of-the-year lionization. Million Dollar Baby is one such movie and it would be a travesty if its storyline and performances (Hilary Swanks in particular) are passed over. By my reckoning Million Dollar Baby is the second-best English-language feature released in theaters this year and as such means that Eastwood deserves another Best Picture nomination. Heres a man who has finally put Dirty Harry to rest. Three strong performances highlight Million Dollar Baby. Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are their usual reliable selves. Each approaches the material with the practiced ease of a veteran and the result is a pair of three-dimensional characters. But in many ways theyre just supporting Hilary Swank. Since her Oscar-winning turn in 1999s Boys Dont Cry Swank has appeared in a number of less-than-memorable films. Eastwood has drawn another great performance out of her proving that the talent is there for a director who understands how to tap it. Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald a 31-year old woman who wants to box professionally. She approaches Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) hoping that he will train her. His response is curt he doesnt teach girls and even if he did shes too old. But Maggie is relentless and she gains an ally Eddie Dupris (Freeman) Frankies long-time friend and cohort. When Frankie loses his job managing a potential heavyweight contender he finds himself at loose ends and in a moment of sympathy he agrees to help Maggie. Soon under his tutelage she finds herself on the fast track to a championship bout. For a while the film plays like a version of Rocky or Girlfight with equal focus on the trainer and the trainee. (Think of a Rocky where Burgess Meredith shares equal screen time with Sylvester Stallone.) Theres also less glamorization of the ring activity than often occurs in boxing movies. For Maggie winning isnt about fame and making money - its about loyalty and earning respect. According to the voiceover monologue ""she grew up knowing one thing - she was trash."" Boxing is her way to escape her past. And she remains true to her gruff coach who spends his free time learning Gaelic and reading Yeats and attends mass every day. When a hot-shot manager offers to take over her career and help her into the big time she politely turns him down to remain with Frankie. Had this been all that Million Dollar Baby represented it would have been a solid motion picture heartfelt if somewhat unremarkable. But the film takes an unexpected turn in its third act and ends up asking some of the same questions posited by Alejandro Amenabars The Sea Inside (curiously the films open the same weekend in the United States). Chief amongst these is the most painful What shows more heart - to help a loved one to die with dignity or to offer support to ease the pain of what they view as a valueless existence? Amenabar and Eastwood demand much from their audiences as they emphasize the difficulties of either path. The Sea Inside is probably the more accomplished of the two films but Million Dollar Baby packs a greater emotional wallop. One of the most impressive aspects of Million Dollar Baby is its scope and the way it manages to pack so much into 2 1/4 hours. The story never seems rushed; Eastwood allows the characters and circumstances to breathe by including subplots featuring a mentally retarded would-be fighter (Jay Baruchel) Maggies ungrateful and rapacious family and Frankies guilt-ridden past. If there is a weakness to be found it lies in the sometimes cartoonish approach of Baruchel. But that sounds and feels like nitpicking. I deem a movie to be worthwhile if I need time to recover after seeing it. Million Dollar Baby is such a film. It does not easily release the viewer and it demands a time of reflection and contemplation afterwards. It is a rich and challenging motion picture that both affirms life and emphasizes its fragility. Eastwood touches our hearts and energizes our minds without resorting to overt manipulation. Million Dollar Baby is refreshingly free of the kind of tear-wringing melodrama that has become seemingly obligatory for this kind of story. You dont have to be a boxing fan to appreciate what Eastwood has wrought. This is a movie with the ability to win over all comers.

Staying at the top of his game when most of his contemporaries have long since hung up their gloves Clint Eastwood delivers another knockout punch with ""Million Dollar Baby."" As if ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"" werent grave enough this endlessly resourceful filmmaker goes just as dark and deep in this slow-burning drama of a determined female boxer and her hard-shelled trainer a tale Eastwood invests with rewarding reserves of intimacy tragedy tenderness and bitter life knowledge. ""Mystic River"" greatly surpassed anyones commercial expectations for a genuinely downbeat film and Warner Bros. faces a similar challenge with this one to transform certain critical acclaim into winning box office. With so much success behind him Eastwood continues to fearlessly tackle disturbing material that offers no assurance of public acceptance. Hes got a lot on his mind -- mortality moral decisions living with mistakes and what one makes of ones short time on earth -- and he continues to hone his filmmaking style in a way so highly refined it approaches the abstract. Based primarily on a 40-page story called ""Million  Baby"" that was one of six brilliant short stories by veteran boxing cut-man F.X. Toole published in 2000 under the title ""Rope Burns Stories From the Corner"" Paul Haggis script is centered on the low-rent but homey downtown Los Angeles gym run by old school boxing sage Frank (Eastwood). Absent any family (the weekly letters he sends to his estranged daughter are always returned) and still hungry for a fighter who could go to the top Frank has placed his hopes on a talented heavyweight (Mike Colter) who just when hes poised for a title shot dumps the patient trainer who brought him to the brink of greatness for a more financially savvy manager. Frank is a complicated old guy. Ornery cantankerous and abrasive he can be especially rough on his closest friend Scrap (Morgan Freeman) a one-eyed former fighter who lives at the gym and looks after it. A regular churchgoer Frank has become such a nudge with all his doubting questions that his priest (Brian OByrne) would rather he stay away. Just as he tries to maintain his link with Catholicism he also tries to maintain a bridge to his Irish heritage by studying Gaelic and reading Yeats. Frank is none too welcoming when self-described hillbilly Maggie (Hilary Swank) turns up at the gym and begins cajoling him to train her(all the other young boxers are black or Latino). He uses every excuse to discourage Maggie He doesnt take on ""girls""; at 31 shes too old; she doesnt even know how to punch a heavybag or a speedbag. Waitressing and living on pennies Maggie with a little help from Scrap finally wears down Franks resistance. Maggie is betting her life on boxing. She has decided the sweet science represents her one shot at a life better than the lives of her welfare-grubbing trailer trash mother and siblings. Sensing like her the obvious surrogate father-daughter bond growing between them Frank begins to respect her and his regard increases when she starts mowing down club fight opponents. For awhile ""Million Dollar Baby"" may appear to be headed for female ""Rocky"" territory a story of a young long-shot paired with an old bag of damaged goods who through mutual reinforcement make it to the top together. But those familiar with Tooles story will know better and anyone who has followed Eastwoods work will realize the director couldnt be bothered with a story that simplistic. Script by Haggis a longtime TV writer whose directorial debut ""Crash"" preemed at the Toronto fest provides the piece with a perfectly balanced three-act structure although he has somewhat diluted the piss-and-vinegar of Tooles gritty prose. And unlike the volatility of the racial issues in ""Crash"" and Tooles work Eastwood as usual approaches them so matter-of-factly as to render them irrelevant. But Eastwood and Haggis never take their eyes off the heart of the matter. At center this is the story of two people one 40 years older than the other who have no one but each other -- if they drop their guard enough to let the other in. Franks regrets and doubts in life eat at him every day while Maggies determination never to crawl back to mama means shes got to make it on her own. Which she does up to a point. Her series of almost instantaneous KOs is presented in an invigoratingly comic manner. But after Maggie returns from Europe as a star with an impassioned (and largely Irish) following tragedy quickly follows sending the film in an unexpectedly emotional and rarefied direction that had it been mined for pure heart-tugging potential would have been unbearably sentimental. But Eastwood is made of sterner stuff and the sobriety restraint and clear-eyed honesty with which he treats this final section elevates the film to a moving and resonant realm. The life-or-death drama pushes to the brink and beyond the crucial character issues carefully planted early on. Franks faith quickness to assign blame and way of dealing with regret are thrown into question by all that is suddenly at stake. He also finds a way to cut through his anger and self-protection to clearly consider the most momentous decision of his life. Sounding like an old truck grinding down a deep-rutted gravel road Eastwood the actor breezes through the easy gruffness with which Frank at first dismisses Maggie and the nagging banter in which he and Freemans Scrap engage like a forever-married couple. But he goes much further his scrunched visage and too-ready answers portraying a perennial anxiety his bedtime prayers and tearful encounter with the priest exposing a man never free of his demons. Surprisingly vulnerable his performance here stands as one of his most distinctive and urgently felt. Having gotten into strong-looking but not fortunately designer-buff shape for her role Swank more than holds her own in the gym and up against real fighting babes in the ring. She also impresses as an uneducated lower-class woman who has fixed upon one big idea to drive her life but whose heart and natural generosity give her equilibrium when confronted with adversity. Freeman is utterly credible as the grizzled old gladiator. As far as the characterizations are concerned the only reservations pertain to the unanswered question of what Maggie has been doing for the past decade (in the story shes done a substantial stretch of small-time fighting on her own) and to a simpleton named Danger who hangs out at the gym and whose fantasies of boxing are indulged by Scrap and others; Danger smacks too much of similar sentimentalized characters in 50s drama and television. Eastwoods style is so concentrated and pared down here that he hardly bothers with such expected niceties as local color and location establishment; he just jumps right into the emotional life of his characters. Vet production designer Henry Bumstead creates most of the atmosphere with his lived-in gym set and lenser Tom Stern goes daringly dark at times in work that helps illuminate the characters. Eastwood himself has provided a score notable for spare simplicity. Million Dollar BabyProductionA Warner Bros. release presented in association with Lakeshore Entertainment of a Malpaso production.
