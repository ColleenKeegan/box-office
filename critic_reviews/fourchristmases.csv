Comments Four Christmases Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are San Francisco professionals whove spent three happy years together without ever meeting each others divorced parents. After heavy fog grounds their flight to Fiji theyre forced to spend Christmas Day shuttling from one awful family gathering to another and another and another. Every holiday season brings at least one big-studio comedy about people who despise their relatives but finally accept with a sigh that family is what matters. This is marginally better than most with a few offbeat comic ideas a reliably droll performance from Vaughn and as the parents four watchable old troupers in search of a fat paycheck (Robert Duvall Sissy Spacek Jon Voight Mary Steenburgen). Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) directed. PG-13 82 min. By J.R.

John P. Johnson/New Line Cinema Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play San Franciscos most self-absorbed couple in Four Christmases a home- (and home- and home- and home-) for-the-holidays sitcom that youd think would be able to find at least a little com somewhere in all those sits. Alas theres scarcely a moment of ingenuity or surprise in this tale of the supremely smug unmarried-but-made-for- each-other Brad and Kate who get trapped through an unlucky and unlikely coincidence into visiting all four of the divorced parents theyve been avoiding for years -- all on a single Christmas morning. Their cell phones start jangling the moment a TV crew shows up at the fogged-in airport where their getaway flights been grounded and before you can say ""plot contrivance"" theyre off to see Brads dyspeptic bumpkin of a dad (Robert Duvall) and the two Neanderthal brothers Kate didnt know he had. Slapstick ensues some of it involving the installation of a rooftop satellite dish some of it just random (wrestling tackles in the living room an infants projectile-vomiting). This naturally convinces Kate she should really become a mother. Its followed by a visit to Brads cradle-robbing mom (Sissy Spacek) whos shacked up with her sons best friend. After a bit of curiously fierce board-game playing the couple zips off to see Kates upper-crusty mother (Mary Steenburgen) who drags them to church where they get roped into portraying Mary and Joseph in a Christmas pageant. Finally they head for the home of Kates laid-back earnest dad (Jon Voigt) for ... well for a rest apparently as the four screenwriters have by this time reached the bottom of their bag of tricks and are reduced to repeating that uproarious puking-infant gag a second time. If any of this sounds remotely clever rest assured Im just not telling it right. Director Seth Gordon whose indie arcade-game doc The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters glimmered with promise last year cant be said to have delivered on it this time out. His stars are charmless his script cheerless and his sterling supporting cast (Jon Favreau Carol Kane Dwight Yoakam Kristin Chenowith and others) cant seem to figure out what theyve been brought on board to do. There is one moment late in the films running time (which is barely 82 minutes astonishingly enough) when Duvall has a quiet moment of bitterness on his front porch and you realize what he might have contributed if hed only had a line or three to work with. But Santa was stingy and that scenes the only one that even semi-resonates.

PLAY Get in the holiday spirit with the Christmas Movies Pop Video Quiz Smug lawyer Brad (Vince Vaughn) and his live-in girlfriend Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are rich San Franciscans who have been together for three years. Kate doesnt want to get married or have kids and says things like ""We dont want our relationship to turn into work"" - which tells you this movie was written by guys (four of them) who wish their girlfriends would take the hint. Each year Brad and Kate blow off Christmas with their families to do something fun instead while telling their folks theyre off doing charity work - this year in ""Burma the island off the coast of Asia."" Actually theyre going to Fiji but when all planes are grounded in the fog they (according to the movie) must report for duty with all four split-up parents. But both Brad and Kate turn out to be entirely unacquainted with the others family. It must be obvious to all parties that their Christmas ruse is just an excuse to cut off all contact so why dont they continue to ignore their families who must be used to it by now? The movie boasts five Oscar winners. That figure exceeds by five the number of times I laughed at this cheap collection of icky jokes and stereotypes about heartland types who do horrible things like have babies and go to church. Brads dad (Robert Duvall) presides over a white-trash family of ""cage fighters"" including a son (Vaughns buddy Jon Favreau looking especially meaty) who keeps tackling Brad with pro-wrestling moves. Brad and Kate are embarrassed by a 10 spending limit on gifts (when is poverty funny?) and 15 grim minutes wheeze by as were meant to laugh at bad paneling La-Z-Boy seating bologna aerosol cheese and sons with names like ""Dallas"" and ""Denver."" Brad falls off a roof trying to install a satellite dish for the TV which seems to play only black-and-white programming from 1958 and the Duvall character blasts his ex-wife as ""a common street whore."" Even little kids beat on Brad but at the house of Kates mom (Mary Steenburgen) things are totally different Kids beat up on Kate. Also at her house are kitschy Jesus statues an old lady who keeps talking about oral sex and reaching for Brads belt and a white-trash sister (Kristin Chenoweth) who smokes while pregnant and whose baby does to Kate what this movie does to the screen. Unlike actual baby vomit though the upchuck in this movie has no redeeming innocence about it. Everyone winds up at a church service that is played like a monster truck rally. Its unclear whether anyone associated with this movie has ever been to church but Im unfamiliar with any congregation that makes you do things like go up on the altar get in costume and re-enact the Nativity. At the house of Brads mom (Sissy Spacek) the old bag is dating her sons boyhood friend. More dirty-old-lady jokes ""Your mother is a very sexual being"" etc. Also ""Dont eat those brownies - those are grandmothers special brownies."" For about 10 minutes in the last act (at the house of Kates dad played by Jon Voight who gets rushed in for about five lines) people start to behave semi- normally and the movie at least stops being repulsive - but then we head back to the Duvall characters house where old dad says to his son ""What the hell you want? You forget your tampons?"" A raunchy Christmas comedy can work - see ""Bad Santa"" - but going dirty means increased risk. The difference between the average unfunny Christmas comedy and this one is the difference between grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes and grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes with his bathrobe open as his hand creeps up your thigh. Vaughn continues to believe as he did while making last years equally disastrous ""Fred Claus"" that any stream-of-consciousness word dump he delivers is funny if he says it fast enough (sample ""Were open to letting love grow where it wants to grow - were open to letting it grow""). For Witherspoon I just felt sorry. ""Jumper"" ""88 Minutes"" and ""Made of Honor"" have some tough competition in the competition for worst movie of the year. kyle.smithnypost.com FOUR CHRISTMASES Jingle bell raunch. Running time 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity sexual humor). At the Kips Bay the E-Walk the 84th Street others.

(JOHNSON/The Kobal Collect) Joe Neumaier Tuesday November 25 2008 817 PM ""Four Christmases.""  A couple must spend the holiday in each of their divorced parents houses. With Reese Witherspoon Vince Vaughn. Director Seth Gordon (129). PG-13 Language. At area theaters. Like the last gift buried under singing Billy Bass fish dancing Coke cans joke books and mounds of wrapping paper theres a glimmer of fun in ""Four Christmases"" that almost gets vacuumed up with the tinsel. Christmas is all about miracles so in a movie this thuddingly obvious its amazing its there at all. The gift is the small glances star Vince Vaughn gives to his pal Jon Favreau in a cameo appearance as Vaughns mohawked adrenalized-to-kill brother. The buds who shot to fame in ""Swingers"" have just a few scenes together but appear to be having so much fun -- Favreaus sneering sidelong glances could kill an elf -- its easy to forget that the movie seems to have been forgotten by its cast even as they were making it. Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are a couple first spotted meeting cute in a San Francisco bar. Its quickly made clear theyre not the hot-for-each-other bitch and dweeb they look like -- no its just one of the ways this waaacky couple keeps things fresh. Other ways are not getting married or seeing their families on holidays. But when theyre caught on camera killing time in an airport during a flight delay the jig is up and they head to a quartet of houses since both their parents have divorced. Each visit has a set piece -- he falls off a roof she fights a bunch of kids in a bubble-bounce he faces off against the former best friend now dating his mom -- until the accumulated visits make them fight make up then want to settle down. It probably makes elder cast members Robert Duvall Sissy Spacek Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight want to lie down since being around all that mania is nothing short of exhausting. That does seem to be part of the plan though. Clocking in at less than 90 minutes ""Four Christmases"" is played like ""His Girl Friday"" with barely a pause for breath as the story goes from sweet to goofball to what is probably noted in the script as ""Vince riffs here."" Of course thats what this baggy-eyed comic actor does best and whenever Vaughn can go off on tangents large or small it warrants attention. Too bad brittle Wither-spoon isnt as lively a sparring partner for him as Jennifer Aniston was in ""The Break-Up"" or Owen Wilson in ""Wed-ding Crashers.""Which brings us once again to Favreau. Though he and Vaughn seem to have switched cholesterol counts over the years (the formerly huge Favreau is now ""Iron Man"" size while ex-beanpole Vaughn could be mistaken for a bear rug) their rapport is still effortlessly goofy. Think of it as fun tear-away wrapping on whats essentially a boring pair of socks. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Four Christmases (PG-13) Warner Bros. (89 min.) Directed by Seth Gordon. With Vince Vaughn Reese Witherspoon. Opens Wednesday in theaters throughout New Jersey.TWO STARS On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me Five siblings sniping. Four parents fighting. Three rivals wrestling. Two babies puking. And a huge case of anxiety. Thats the set-up for ""Four Christmases"" anyway. For their three years together Brad and Kate have been keeping the holidays in their own way -- which means not at all. They call their four separated parents one by one make up some story about the new Third World country theyre about to go do charity work in and head off for a South Seas vacation. Except this year bad weather cancels their flight. And they find themselves spending the day doing one family event after another cringing all the while. ""Four Christmases"" was written by four beginning screenwriters but the Cheetos-stained fingerprints on it belong to star Vince Vaughn. The movie features a couple of his old friends from ""Swingers"" (including Jon Favreau in a Mohawk) and owes a lot to Vaughns own lovable-slob just-us-guys sense of humor. But what it owes it never quite pays off. Unlike dramas -- where a single vision usually yields the best results -- great comedies are often script by committee with different people tossing out one-liners situations or physical gags until someone finally joins it together and types it up. In ""Four Christmases"" though you can still see the splices. Not only is each family its own crude over-the-top cliche the relationships dont make sense. In what universe would a hippie-dippie earth-mothering Sissy Spacek ever have had three kids with a pinch-of-Skoal hot-damn redneck Robert Duvall? And why is Reese Witherspoon dirty-mouthed and kinky in the first scene and prim and proper for all the rest? The movie confuses characters with gags -- and its in such a hurry to get to the next punchline that it fails to really develop any of the people along the way. Thats a big mistake because the jokes its obsessed with arent that funny. Vaughns father is a coarse buffoon whose brutal sons like beating their brother up; at Witherspoons mothers house the big laughs revolve around breast-feeding and a sex-crazed grandmother. Yuk-yuk. Or mostly yuck. Both Vaughn -- who showed a loose-limbed charm in ""The Break-Up"" and ""The Wedding Crashers"" -- and Witherspoon are pleasant enough here. (Its also amusing to see just how high theyve made Witherspoons heels in hopes of getting her in the same frame as her towering co-star.) And the supporting cast of parents includes such welcome older faces as Duvall Spacek Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight. But the picture never goes anywhere -- just lurches from house to house joke to joke while making sure that its hero and heroine suddenly have (and resolve) some gigantic life dilemmas over the course of 24 hours. Its meant Im sure as a bright shiny new holiday present to all of us. But it really needs to be stamped Dont Open Until DVD. Rating note The film contains strong language sexual humor and violence.

"Four Christmases No holiday treat | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentFour Christmases No holiday treatIts Four Christmases in need of a wedding or maybe a funeral.Reese Witherspoon plays Kate part of a sizeable big-name cast in Four Christmases opening today.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterWed. Nov. 26 2008 Starring Vince Vaughn Reese Witherspoon and Robert Duvall. Directed by Seth Gordon. 82 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Its Four Christmases in need of a wedding or maybe a funeral. Article Continued BelowThe Yule comedy/catastrophe movie calls for some cataclysmic finale like the Griswold Christmas dinner and the exploding overcooked turkey in the classic of the genre John Hughess Christmas Vacation.The Four Christmases screenwriters (all four of them) must have been visited by the Ghost of Charles Dickens. Before all the opportunities for in-law humour are quite exhausted they drop the cynically inspired holiday ho-ho-hos in favour of Hallmark Christmas card sentimentality about the importance of embracing family.Sexual role-playing and mutual materialistic indulgence are what keep Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) happy and together. They are not interested in marriage or children and certainly not in spending Christmas with their respective families. ""You really cant spell families without lies"" Brad smugly advises his workmates who wonder how the couple manage to avoid the annual ritual. Theyve invented a ritual of their own. Instead of visiting their divorced parents four separate homes they invent a humanitarian reason - like helping flood victims - for a vacation in a hot climate. On this Christmas Day they are scheduled to fly out of San Francisco to Fiji. But when fog socks in the city and all flights are cancelled the jigs up for Brad and Kate.A TV camera is thrust into their faces and after their families see them on the news theyre forced to attend four Christmas celebrations.First stop is the Dukes of Hazzard household where Brads father (Robert Duvall) and brothers two sadistic brutes named Dallas (country singer Tim McGraw) and Denver (Jon Favreau) are celebrating.The boys are named after the cities where they were conceived. Brad has neglected to tell Kate that his real name is Orlando.The family visits introduce us to a gallery of American Gothic characters from Brads mother the aging hippie (Sissy Spacek) to Kates born-again mom Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen) and her sisters at the ""cougar den"" to the evangelistic pastor (Dwight Yoakam) to whom Marilyn pledges ""to give more of myself"" to Kates really creepy sister with the plastic face (Kristin Chenoweth).The big gag here is an actual gag Brad cant keep his dinner down when a baby pukes all over Kate. But when it comes to Kates father (John Voight) and his latest wife the story goes all Bob Cratchit on us. In the warm embrace of a less dysfunctional family Kate gets marriage-minded - and broody.An awful lot of talent signed up here for a Christmas blockbuster bound to disappoint. The vulgar humour is going to turn off those looking for Miracle on 34th Street and the smarmy sentiment will turn off all fun-loving grinches.

"Not enough gifts for Four Christmases - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Not enough gifts for Four Christmases Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By John P. Johnson New Line Cinema Reese Witherspoon is on baby duty during her whirlwind trip with her boyfriend to all four parents houses in Four Christmases. WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY One and a half Christmases is about all thats worth celebrating in Four Christmases (  out of four). The film has its funny moments but they are too few to make the holiday excursion worthwhile. This predictable and dyspeptic story presents yet another dysfunctional family gathering as weve come to expect in modern yuletide movies. But its not darkly comic enough to qualify as devilishly misanthropic a la Bad Santa. And with its cloying-as-sticky-pudding conclusion the movie undercuts whatever black humor it managed to muster in earlier scenes. Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play Brad and Kate a happily unmarried couple who prefer sunny getaways to going home for the holidays. Each year they convince their parents that theyre off to do charity work in a distant land when in fact theyre headed for a lazy exotic getaway. Both are products of divorce and the holidays are fraught with painful memories. When their winter holiday to Fiji is postponed they are compelled through a funny if forced turn of events to visit the four homes of their respective parents. They head first to see Brads father (a dull Robert Duvall). Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw are Vaughns cage-fighter brothers and the trio engage in overlong bouts of unfunny wrestling. There also is a mean-spirited gift-giving scene that has to do with limited finances which given the economic climate feels in particularly poor taste. Next stop is a houseful of cougars and the joke quickly runs out of steam. Kates mother (Mary Steenburgen) sidles up to Brad while her sister (Kristin Chenoweth) flirts with him. Shots of Brad eyeing her cleavage dont get funnier with repetition. On it goes. Brads mother (Sissy Spacek) has an unlikely new beau in a segment that flounders. The final stop is with Kates dad (Jon Voight). Perhaps the funniest moment involves a Christmas pageant in which our no-longer-so-happy couple take key roles. The day is marked by mayhem rather than mistletoe. All thats missing is a pratfall caused by spiked eggnog. Its the sort of nasty broad comedy that is better suited to Vaughn than Witherspoon who looks almost sheepish. The more the merrier definitely does not apply to Four Christmases. (Rated PG-13 for some sexual humor and language. Running time 1 hour 28 minutes.

The story of couple Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn)--not married might as well be--who fogged in on December 25 put their planned Fiji frolic on hold to visit their four divorced parents in the course of a single day the movie doesnt offer a single surprise within its scant 82 minutes which feel like at least twice that. Theres happiness and cheer and more than the occasional tear dropped between shouting matches and withering stares all pre-assembled and gift-wrapped by the ho-ho-hos at The Studio.Sure there was every reason to hope for more. Four Christmases was after all directed by Seth Gordon whose 2007 The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters was a bittersweet hilarious documentary in which a cocky mullet squares off against a sweet doofus over a Donkey Kong machine. At first word was that Gordon had been hired to remake his fact as Hollywood fiction. Then word was that Gordon was doing his home-for-the-holidays movie--the sure sign a comer had gone in the wrong direction. How cute though Gordon brought King of Kongs sweet doofus Steve Wiebe along to Hollywood to appear in Four Christmases. Alas he says nothing and in one scene pretends to sleep on a couch.Still--Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon right? As sure a thing as pancakes and bacon on Christmas morning. But even there the pairings off. Whatever Vaughn has going for him--charming bluster hellacious timing velvet delivery doughy good looks--he serves up times a thousand here; as big ol Brad the guys turned up to 11. In the past Vaughn has proven capable of lowering the volume without sacrificing what made him; hes rather good in the underrated The Break-Up as unflinching as Four Christmases is phony. Here he must have felt the need to shout just to be heard.And Witherspoons just . . . there. And barely there at that no doubt a condition brought about by standing next to Mount Vaughn who tends to dwarf anyone with whom he shares a scene. As perky/grumpy poor ol Kate she starts out strong role-playing as a take-no-shit barfly who screws Vaughns wallflower put-on in a bathroom stall during the opening scene. But as the movie deflates (starting about two minutes in) so does she. Then again its hard to act in a movie that has you driving here and there and back again in barely more time than an episode of an TV dramedy.Its also difficult to build a character when the writers--four of them one for every 20 minutes--fail to create anything more than bland archetypes. (It takes forever just to find out Brads a lawyer; we never do discover Kates profession.) Their own parents being divorced Kate and Brad dont want to get married; lifes rough. Only Kates having doubts; hints are dropped early. Then whispers become screams as one by one they visit the folks first Brads dad (a surly Robert Duvall); then Kates mom (a horny Mary Steenburgen); then Brads mom (a hornier Sissy Spacek); and finally Kates dad (a patronly and oddly smooth-surfaced Jon Voight).If you think one home-for-the-holidays movie is bad--and until this years A Christmas Tale imported from France there hadnt been a decent offering in the subgenre since Jodie Fosters um Home for the Holidays in 1995--imagine a four-pack only with just time enough for a single sitcom setup and the shrugging happily-ever-after each. The pace here is lethargic; the movie desperately needs a laugh track. Only the jokes terrible to begin with.When Four Christmases isnt forced its simply lazy like when the writers somehow jam Vaughn into a short-short robe to play the part of Joseph in Dwight Yoakams church where . . . oh did I mention Dwight Yoakams in this? Also Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw as Vaughns brothers Denver and Dallas respectively both of whom are backyard amateur cage fighters. And Kristin Chenoweth as Kates baby-machine sister. Carole Kane and Colleen Camp are here too. This things as star-studded as a Very Special Episode of The Love Boat. And look its a Swingers reunion featuring not only Favreau but also Patrick Van Horn who was Swingers Sue and now plays Brads former BFF turned moms lovey-dovey boyfriend. Ick.There is of course the slightest chance that Four Christmases wasnt intended as a comedy; its so irritating at times--the people the screeching the way everything looks washed out in a made-in-the-early-80s way--that maybe Gordon was going for ironic grim and sad. Or perhaps it was gutted of its best moments. Surely something was left on the kitchen floor to get this thing under 90 minutes. Based on the evidence provided by King of Kong Gordon is capable of better--to say nothing of Witherspoon Vaughn and their small army of co-stars. Really Four Christmases is too benign to get too worked up about. For a worse Christmas movie one need look back no further than last falls Fred Claus starring Vaughn and that poor poor Paul Giamatti.

Starring Reese Witherspoon Vince Vaughn Robert Duvall Mary Steenburgen Sissy Spacek Jon Favreau Tim McGraw Jon Voight Director Seth Gordon  Editorial Review ""Four Christmases"" which is several maraschino cherries short of a fruitcake has a refreshing point to make about family. If you dont like yours ignore it. When the holidays arrive tell your parents youre inoculating children in Burma so whoops looks like youll miss Christmas again this year. The movie sticks with this family-unfriendly notion till the very end but any whiff of delectable domestic comedy is overwhelmed by scenes such as the one in which a toddler sticks a used pregnancy test in her mouth. Or when a baby soaks Reese Witherspoon with vomit. Theres a good movie buried in ""Four Christmases"" underneath the layers of baloney and ham but we never get much of a taste. Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn play San Francisco lovebirds who avoid Christmas with their divorced parents by planning vacations disguised as volunteer expeditions. But this year a thick fog grounds all the flights. Before Christmas Day is out the pair has to make four separate stops one for each divorced parent. Vaughn and Witherspoon both peppy and likable have before them four scenarios in which to preen riff jab and yuk-yuk. And get a load of their parents Robert Duvall Oscar winner. Mary Steenburgen Oscar winner. Sissy Spacek Oscar winner. Jon Voight Oscar winner. Unfortunately the actors are nothing but fancy window dressing in this movie which rushes from scene to scene before bad gags have time to land their bad punch lines. The only laughs come from Vaughn a master of ingratiation. Witherspoon is no Roz Russell or Lucille Ball. But she fills space nicely. She provides the movies faint emotional heartbeat courtesy of her characters ticking biological clock. So the question arises Do they want to start their own family? Maybe. But their hypothetical child would spend Christmases not at grandpa and grandmas house but on islands in the South Pacific. Which come to think of it is where wed rather be instead of watching this movie. --Dan Zak (Nov. 26 2008) Contains sexual humor and language.

Theyre equally selfish and self-absorbed -- so much so in fact that its a bit of stretch to imagine either truly caring for another person -- and they share a snarky disdain for those lesser mortals who need marital ties to bind them. Cheerfully uncoupled even as they cohabitate in a trendy-chic San Francisco home they delight in sustaining the magic of their happily unmarried bliss by role-playing in pick-up bars. Theyre so caught up in each other that each Christmas they vacation together in some far-away romantic location. Home for the holidays? Bah humbug. They lie to their relatives claiming that theyre tied up with charity work during the holiday season thereby avoiding anything so uncool as a family gathering. Unfortunately for Brad and Kate they run out of luck and excuses when theyre caught on camera by a TV news crew while fogged in at the airport on their way to Fiji. One thing leads to another and the normally carefree couple winds up committed to visiting all four of their divorced parents -- and four sets of extended families -- on the same Christmas Day. Ho ho ho? No no no. Four Christmases isnt especially cheery during the opening scenes that establish its high concept. But some of the give and take between Brad and Kate self-satisfied yuppies who revel in their own sense of entitlement is undeniably amusing in a misanthropic sort of way. As the movie proceeds apace however what initially promises to be a gleefully nasty holiday-themed comedy -- a cup of Christmas jeer in the Bad Santa tradition -- quickly devolves into a strenuously unfunny broadly overplayed misfire. And things only get worse when somewhere around the three-quarters mark director Seth Gordon (making his feature debut after his documentary The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters) and no fewer than four credited screenwriters shamelessly lurch into the very sort of sappy sentimentality that they mock throughout most of the preceding scenes. And things only get worse when somewhere around the three-quarters mark director Seth Gordon (making his feature debut after his documentary The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters) and no fewer than four credited screenwriters shamelessly lurch into the very sort of sappy sentimentality that they mock throughout most of the preceding scenes. Everyone tries too hard and too obviously right from the start. You know youre in for a rough time of it when Brad and Kate visit Brads cranky low-brow dad (Robert Duvall -- yes that Robert Duvall) and ultimate-fighter brothers (Jon Favreau country music star Tim McGraw). And the caricatures are scarcely less overbearing in subsequent scenes as the couple visits Kates mother (Mary Steenburgen) -- whos smitten with a flamboyant minister (played alas by a decidedly non-flamboyant Dwight Yoakam) -- and Brads hippie-dippie mother (Sissy Spacek). By the time they get around to calling on Kates dad (Jon Voight) you can easily sympathize with the couples aversion to matrimony and all it entails. And yet thats precisely when the movie takes a turn for the even worse as Kate inexplicably starts to warm to traditional family values. Four Christmases wastes several talented people (including at least three Oscar winners) in underwritten roles and cops out with an ending that proves the moviemakers lack the courage of their own smart-alecky cynicism. Vaughn tries to bulldoze through the proceedings with his trademark style of rapid-fire wordiness. That helps but not enough.

"fast paised - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs fast paisedNovember 26 2008|By MATT PAISFour ChristmasesRATING 2 EXCLAMATION POINTSWhen their flight from San Francisco to Fiji is postponed a day unmarried couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are forced to visit each of their divorced parents to celebrate Christmas four times in one day. This results in plenty of uncomfortable ""Meet the Parents""-esque situations involving Brads ultimate fighter brothers (Jon Favreau Tim McGraw) hard-ass dad (Robert Duvall) and sexually frisky mom (Sissy Spacek) plus Kates nosy sister (Kristin Chenoweth) newly religious mom (Mary Steenburgen) and supportive father (Jon Voight).The verdict ""Four Christmases"" needs approximately two Christmases to make you feel completely exhausted. Vaughns motor-mouth routine lands a few winners but the movie is all schtick all the time. So many holiday movies aim to show how grueling family celebrations can be but thats no reason the movie themselves have to be such a chore.Transporter 3RATING 2 1/2 EXCLAMATION POINTSBack for another testosterone-fueled delivery extraordinary driver Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is transporting a passenger fiery redhead Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) whos been kidnapped to blackmail her father the Ukraines head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Worth noting Franks employers saddle him and Valentina with bracelets that will explode if they go more than 75 feet from their car.The verdict Landing somewhere between parts one and two in the mindless innocent fun department ""Transporter 3"" becomes something thats not serious but doesnt make a joke of itself either. Even though director Oliver Megaton gets too busy with MTV-style cutting and too cute when Frank and Valentina let work turn into play some terrifically implausible stunts make it very easy to sit through this nonsense.ALSO OUTWhat Matt says about ...Australia PG-13RATING 2 EXCLAMATION POINTSCall it a little show on a big stage or tiny brushes on a huge canvas. But you also have to call it disappointing.Twilight PG-13RATING 2 EXCLAMATION POINTSThe term ""meh"" was added to the dictionary [last] week and just in time.Role Models RRATING 3 1/2 EXCLAMATION POINTSThe funniest movie since ""Superbad.""Slumdog Millionaire RRATING 3 1/2 EXCLAMATION POINTSGives ""crowd-pleaser"" a good name.WANT MORE MATT?Find more Fast-Paised reviews at metromix.com MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesChristmastime + fun = actress Kristin ChenowethNovember 29 2008Can Cher save Logo?January 17 2013The trouble with Vince Vaughn and his new movie Delivery...November 22 2013Find More Stories AboutValentinaTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-four-christmases-review-1126nov26,0,1221268.story",200,fourchristmases15,fourchristmases,chicagotribune

Johnson Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn in ""Four Christmases."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Over the course of 80 minutes the disappointing comedy ""Four Christmases"" hauls out countless stereotypes and attempts to play them for kicks Theres the cougar the camouflage-wearing redneck and his wife -- a woman with a penchant for cooking with Miracle Whip and E-Z Cheese. Then theres the Neil Diamond doppelganger who just so happens to be the pastor at a charismatic Christian church. But the action centers on the emblematic 21st-century couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) an affluent San Francisco pair who profess to want neither children nor marriage. They prefer the footloose lifestyle of late nights and interesting couple activities like dance lessons. Of course Brad and Kate dont care for their families -- from Kates cougar mom to Brads redneck dad and everyone in between. Both come from broken homes. Their plan of avoidance includes booking a vacation every Christmas -- this year theyre destined for Fiji. But when a dense Dec. 25 fog tips into the Bay their flight is canceled and theyre forced to spend the holiday visiting their splintered families. Enter the magic of Christmas. To be sure the movie has a few hilarious moments In the very beginning an amusing scene shows the couple indulging a devious role-playing fantasy. Later on Brad gets the acting bug when hes drafted to play Joseph in the churchs holiday pageant. By the end of the play he is so overcome by a performance high that he starts barking ad-libbed orders at a panicked and stage-frightened Mary -- who of course is played by his sweetie Kate. ""Four Christmases"" is also a nice-looking watchable movie The performances are strong even if the chemistry between Vaughn and Witherspoon is lacking. There are plenty of stylish clothes and rich character-driven set designs -- frilly interiors at the ""cougars den"" taxidermy at the rednecks house. The soundtrack is made of catchy fun-loving Christmas tunes. (The film was directed by relative newcomer Seth Gordon.) But the script is only marginally comical. The jokes are lame and for the most part overly reliant on cliche. (Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson are responsible for the second-rate screenplay.) Worst of all the storys central conflict isnt even believable The couple start Christmas Day on the same page. But as they circuit their familys various functions Kate becomes racked by maternal longings. At her mothers house she holds an infant niece whos plagued by projectile vomit and voila -- suddenly she too wants to spawn. FOUR CHRISTMASES  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13; sexual humor and language. Needless to say this doesnt go over with Brad. Soon the bickering between him and Kate is so intense the moviegoer is reminded of Edward Albees insufferable ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" In the end a musty procreation moral is left to push forth this flimsy plot -- and thats neither original nor particularly funny.

Its four home-for-the-holidays comedies in one and the variety-pack structure works for the movie Each nightmare household has a wacked flavor all its own and none wears out its welcome. (The entire film runs 89 minutes.) The halfway humane joke is that Vaughn and Witherspoon have avoided marriage and kids so whats missing from their lives is the messiness of...life. Enter the coarse bawdy corrective that is the Christmas family megaplex comedy. The quartet of house parties are sprinkled with witty actors like Jon Favreau alarmingly convincing as Vaughns mohawked sociopath brother and Mary Steenburgen who gives Witherspoons pious mother a touch of erotic gumption. Its a pleasure to see Vaughn play an actual character -- a nervous motormouth who speaks in loop-the-loop sentences he uses to talk himself into things. Those sentences are the sound of an actor trying in his way to grow up. B?

That seems to be the calculation guiding this festive frolic in which Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon tell their respective folks theyre doing charity work so that they can avoid the usual get-together. Alas their ruse is uncovered so they end up visiting all four post-divorce enclaves in one fateful Christmas Day.Playing out a seasonal riff on the same comedy of embarrassment as Meet the Parents Vaughns mean old coot of a pater Robert Duvall and wrestling-freak sibling Jon Favreau  along with Mary Steenburgen as Witherspoons lubricious yet church-happy mom supply plentiful warning of the dangers of procreation. As we grind through the gears of consecutive drop-ins however behind the strained knockabout lurks a none-too-subtle conformist agenda assuring the unmarried childless couple that their only chance for genuine happiness is to get with the family programme. Humbug we say. Dismaying indeed that a movie purportedly selling itself on refreshing nay-saying scepticism should so cravenly succumb to the same old schmaltz without the craft even to make the process seem anything other than a series of empty would-be feelgood platitudes. Still there are occasional felicities en route with some ably delivered trailer moment slapstick - watch out for that baby vomit - and the cast do their best with the uneven material even if Vaughn in particular makes the patter a tad too effortful. Nostalgic for some to have him and Favreau reunited here yet seeing the Swingers duo desperately mugging away in such mainstream mulch their catchphrase Youre so money takes on an awful new resonance.

"Movie review Four Christmases -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Four Christmases -- 2 out of 5 stars Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn in Four Christmases Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn in Four Christmases Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn in Four Christmases Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Four Christmases hurls towering Vince Vaughn at tiny Reese Witherspoon and a lot of Oscars at a lightweight holiday farce. This comedy about a happy couple made miserable by having to visit four divorced parents begins with a bang but settles into sentiment so maudlin that even this cast cant save it.Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) are happily unmarrieds in San Francisco who fib to family every holiday season making up stories about ""inoculating babies in Burma"" so that no one can gripe when they skip Christmas dinner. Theyd rather fly to Fiji. ""You really cant spell families without the lies"" brags Brad.But Frisco fog closes the airport and a TV reporter busts them with their ruined travel plans. Before you can say ""mistletoe"" (their ""safety word"") theyve been outed and theyre driving all over the Bay area ""celebrating"" with relatives they avoid. Ex-documentary director Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) stages each visit as an episode with the energy flagging steadily from the first to the last. We meet the resentful farmer ( Robert Duvall) who raised Brad to disdain family and the brothers ""Denver"" ( Jon Favreau) and ""Dallas"" ( Tim McGraw) and learn that since Dad named his boys after the town where they were conceived Brads real name is where Disney World resides.Brad faces old humiliations and Kate on meeting Denvers always-breeding/country cookin wife (Katy Mixon a stitch) frets over motherhood.Then they go visit her born-again mom ( Mary Steenburgen) where Kates competitive sister (Kristin Chenoweth funny as always) re-visits the days when ""Katy Cooty"" was fat.By the time they reach Brads hippie mom (Sissy Spacek) who has taken up with his high school buddy the relationship and the movie are in trouble. Its weird to watch Vaughn try to replicate the immortality his pal Peter Billingsley achieved in A Christmas Story. First Fred Claus now this. Billingsley the once-and-always Ralphie has a cameo and got a producing credit here.Witherspoon amps up her game to match the pace of Vaughns manic patter. But they waste so much talent -- Duvall Witherspoon Steenburgen Spacek and Jon Voight (as Kates dad) all have Oscars.A lot of us can identify with the Four Christmases divorced-parents situation. It has enough big laughs to make it marginally better than last years This Christmas or its Latino clone Nothing Like the Holidays. But Vince you are never ever going to get Ralphies Red Ryder bb gun. Give it up. Roger Moore can be reached at rmooreorlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5369.

"Four Christmases | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; four-christmases ) Four Christmases (United States/Germany 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli This is what happens when a successful indie documentary filmmaker gets sucked in by the Hollywood system. As one can guess from the number of writers involved in this project Four Christmases is wildly uneven veering from screwball comedy to would-be heartfelt drama with an inelegance that is more likely to cause whiplash than an emotional catharsis. For a while Seth Gordons (The King of Kong) feature tries to stake its claim alongside other misdeed-strewn Christmas comedies like National Lampoons Christmas Vacation but its implosion and collapse into unfulfilling melodrama during its final third represents as close as a movie like this can get to self-immolation. Four Christmases opens with a ""meet cute"" between Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) in a bar that turns out to be a little less conventional than we suspect. The next thing we know theyre on their way to Fiji for Christmas having decided that the least desirable option for the holiday is to spend it with friends and family. But a massive fogbank envelops San Francisco and theyre stuck for at least a day. That means dividing the time between Brads divorced mom and dad and Kates divorced mom and dad. The first visit takes Kate into the den of redneck testosterone that is inhabited by Brads father (Robert Duvall) and Brads two brothers Denver (Jon Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw). This is where a womans role is to be kept barefoot and pregnant. Stop 2 is to drop in on Kates mother (Mary Steenburgen) and sister (Kristen Chenoweth). This is followed by a visit to Brads mom (Sissy Spacek) then to Kates dad (Jon Voight). By the time of the ""fourth Christmas"" our cheerful couples secure and loving relationship is in tatters. The films first half contains some edgy comedy. Its the kind of dark material that can make a viewer squirm a little and a scene in which a misstep by Brad nearly destroys his fathers house recalls some of the more outrageous moments of Christmas Vacation. Unfortunately the film fails to continue at this manic level. With each subsequent visit Four Christmases becomes less amusing and more tedious. The fourth visit isnt funny nor is that the intention. This is supposed to be serious and dramatic and it doesnt work. As with many comedies that want to go straight at the end to provide an emotional impact the tonal shift fails because the characters are underdeveloped. For most of the movies running length (which is surprisingly short as about 80 minutes) Brad and Kate are comedic caricatures. Wanting an audience to care about them and their circumstances during the final act doesnt work. Theyre not fleshed out enough. While there is a happy ending of sorts it doesnt compensate for the downer that sucks the films final twenty minutes into a morass of failed melodrama. Let me emphasize theres nothing wrong with mingling drama and comedy but it can only work if the characters convince in both the serious and the humorous parts of the story. That doesnt happen here. Most of the supporting characters prove to be more effectively comedic than the two leads. Both Vince Vaughn (now in his second straight sub-par Christmas movie following Fred Claus) and Reese Witherspoon are boring. Neither exudes much in the way of energy. Jon Favreau (Vaughns long-time buddy and occasional collaborator) has a great time playing Brads dumb buff bro. Kristen Chenoweth doesnt get to sing but she does have ample opportunities to display her cleavage as well as the perkiness that makes her character of Olive in Pushing Daisies so endearing. And Robert Duvall gets a chance to play the father whom no one would want to visit on Christmas. Every year it seems that studios toss a seasonal movie or two into theaters in the hopes that viewers will use it as a means to whet their holiday appetites. Quality is rarely present nor is it much of a factor. Four Christmases is waste of time and a disappointment but its also relatively painless. Some of the jokes work there are some laughs to be had and if it all falls apart in the final third its over soon enough that such a major structural fault is easily overlooked. We as audiences have come to expect very little from holiday themed movies and thats precisely what Four Christmases delivers.

Merry Christmas. Vaughn stars as the usual Vaughn character a cynical fast-talker. Although he towers over co-star Reese Witherspoon she goes toe-to-toe with the actor as a sophisticated Grinch. The pair play San Francisco live-ins Brad and Kate whose annual holiday family avoidance technique - elaborate lies about international charity missions - is exposed when a news crew covering a socked-in airport reveals their Fiji vacation plans. Busted they agree to visit each of their divorced folks households on Christmas Day setting up the films Meet the Parents . . . and the Parents . . . and the Parents . . . and the Parents premise. The moms Mary Steenburgen as the born-again mistress of a cougar den and a New Agey Sissy Spacek remind us how cruelly Steenburgen- and Spacek-free the movies are these days. Robert Duvall is the cranky patriarch of a home that is just Ned Beatty short of Bay Area Deliverance. Each visit exposes the cracks in the relationship and Brad and Kates life plan. Curiously only Jon Voight whose estrangements from daughter Angelina Jolie are tabloid legend is spared a mockable character trait as he delivers an earnest speech about family and forgiveness. All thats missing are the words ""Call me Angie"" scrolled across the bottom of the screen. Others to watch for include former A Christmas Story boy wonder Peter Billingsley as an airline agent Dwight Yoakam as the pastor of a church that owes as much to arena football as it does to the Bible and Katy Mixon as a pregnant sister-in-law with preternatural skill in redneck-rules Taboo. Youll find the usual clichs - lunkhead brothers (a bulked-up Jon Favreau and country star Tim McGraw) a condescending big sister (Kristin Chenoweth) photo albums childhood trauma - but theres also an improv Nativity play and slapstick mixed with subtle humor about family dynamics. Is it funny? Yeah. Sometimes very. The laughs come to a halt however for the requisite Learning and Growing. Fortunately a legally improbable epilog assures us that Kate and Brad havent quite mended their ways. Which if this hits is just the setup for the inevitable Four Christenings.

Its a dilemma the director never really solves in this oddly misanthropic occasionally amusing but thoroughly cheerless holiday attraction that is in no way a family film but will no doubt be mistaken for such by many unsuspecting patrons. Given the cast and comic expectations commercial results should be moderately bright at least initially for this New Line venture inherited by Warner Bros. The biggest artistic challenge facing first-time feature helmer Seth Gordon in ""Four Christmases"" was how to photograph co-stars Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon in the same frame as hes about a foot and a half taller than she is. Its a dilemma the director never really solves in this oddly misanthropic occasionally amusing but thoroughly cheerless holiday attraction that is in no way a family film but will no doubt be mistaken for such by many unsuspecting patrons. Given the cast and comic expectations commercial results should be moderately bright at least initially for this New Line venture inherited by Warner Bros. Parents will know theyve walked into the wrong film right away as the opening scene has lovers Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) pretending not to know each other and enacting a pick-up scene at a trendy bar before slipping into the bathroom for some quick shtupping. Remainder of the script by a foursome of writers spins on the view held by these two smug self-satisfied San Francisco professionals that family visits over Christmas are to be avoided at all costs. With their planned trip to Fiji canceled by fog the couple have the misfortune of being shown on TV stranded at the airport resulting in instantaneous parental calls to come visit. As each has divorced parents that makes four households to stop by -- something of a challenge for a twosome who have sworn off marriage and kids for reasons that shortly become obvious. Format thus sets up an episodic structure that would seem to demand that each visit top the last in excruciating hilarious awfulness. But nothing outdoes the spectacle of the first family encounter with Brads grumpy redneck father (Robert Duvall) and his muscle-bound brothers Denver and Dallas (Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw) cage wrestlers both. Sequence unquestionably makes fun of these lower-class yahoos and ends in catastrophe. Next up are Kates mom (Mary Steenburgen) and assorted offspring notably including Kates sister Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth an excellent sibling match-up with Witherspoon). As happened with Brad at the initial stop beans get spilled about Kate here that shed rather keep in the deep freeze. As Mom has taken up with a good ol-time-religion preacher (Dwight Yoakam) everyone heads off to a Christmas pageant in which the visitors are embarrassingly drafted to portray Joseph and Mary. Visiting Brads rich old hippie mother (Sissy Spacek) her son must endure the company of Mas boyfriend who just happens to be one of his own former buddies. By the time they get to the home of Kates father (Jon Voight also aptly cast opposite Witherspoon) shes so bummed she packs off Brad for whom the main lesson of the day has been ""the dangers of procreating."" Kate is in a different state of mind a rather odd one given the calamities of the day and one that sets up a momentary conflict quickly solved. Vaughn is his usual motor-mouthed preoccupied self although less antic and vulgar and more polite and considerate than his norm. Breaking type here is Witherspoon who abandons her perky upbeat image for the brittle somewhat chilly piece of work that is Kate. With all the scripts doubtless at her doorstep in the wake of her ""Walk the Line"" triumph its a wonder she chose this one which in no way relies upon her special talents and does her no particular favors. Set in the Bay Area the pic has modest production values that could have used a little of the coin that no doubt went to pay the 11 producers. Director Gordon parlayed his documentary success with ""The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters"" into this narrative gig and his work is not without promise although he had even more trouble setting up over-the-shoulder shots with his two stars than he did with the two-shots.
