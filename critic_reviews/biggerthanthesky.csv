The giant thing that crowds out the heavens in the title of this uniquely bogus fancily well-marketed indie isnt a star a billion times larger than our sun Its an urge absolutely primal with which the folk of the Portland Community Theater (Which Portland? Pick one) devote themselves to being theater folk with all the hysteria heartache bed-hopping vanity pathos mysterious illness alcohol backstage antics and bad dialogue that attend such a sacred calling. (Even Waiting for Guffmans peerless Corky St. Clair would have found this company too twee for the room.) By the laws of Rodney Vaccaros impossibly dewdropped script wishing and innocence make dreams come true. Thats how Peter (relative newcomer Marcus Thomas) changes his dull sad lonely life by trying out on the spur of the moment for a part in a local production of Cyrano de Bergerac. Its Peters lucky night The shows madcap director (British stage dignitary Clare Higgins) is daft enough to give the eloquent proboscis-challenged title role to the novice who delivered the worst audition. And so its...showtime Under the why-not-me direction of first-timer Al Corley (best known for playing Steven Carrington on Dynasty) the rest of the curiously overqualified cast appear to be doing their own version of community theater. John Corbett Amy Smart Sean Astin Patty Duke and Greg Germann enter and exit doing hammy versions of ham roles and Topsy-Turvys Allan Corduner goes over the top and through the stratosphere as that great great (ailing) local theater legend Kippy. This still leaves the mystery of casting the deeply colorless Thomas in the central role though. Are the filmmakers making meta use of a bland uncharismatic actor to play a bland uncharismatic actor who plays one of the theaters most memorable men? Nah thinking like that requires panache.

Directed by Al Corley Rated PG-13 106 minutes""Look at me -- Im just dull"" Peter Rooker (Marcus Thomas) tells his sister at the beginning of this self-conscious comic drama. And he is. He has a boring art-department job at some unspecified company and his girlfriend has just left him. His life is bleak as Al Corley a first-time film director heavy-handedly demonstrates by showing Peter cooking for himself and watching television in the dark.But Peter is going to be saved. On his way to the office he sees a casting notice for a community-theater production of ""Cyrano."" Although he has no acting experience he auditions. He is very very bad and ""Bigger Than the Sky"" establishes its low credibility by having the plays director Edwina Winters (Clare Higgins) so taken with his supposed realness that she casts him. In the title role.This is idiotic because she has talented experienced company regulars like Michael Degan (the talented experienced John Corbett) available. But Peter accepts the role and soon has a life that revolves around evening rehearsals and late-night drinking with his new friends. He is attracted to his co-star Grace Hargrove (Amy Smart) who is playing Roxanne but Grace and Michael have something going on which complicates matters. Peter also meets the companys beloved former director Kippy Newberg (the excellent Allan Corduner) whose counsel is to ""play true to the end.""""Cyrano"" takes over Peters life and he finds himself arriving late for work and falling asleep at meetings. In a rash moment he quits his job only to drop by the theater and discover Edwina secretly working with another actor the egotistical Ken Zorbell (Sean Astin) because she has lost faith in Peter. Mr. Astin is playing against ""Lord of the Rings"" type (he was the lovable loyal Sam) and participating in a bit of stunt casting. Patty Duke his mother plays a dowdy theater-company employee and that womans identical twin a chain-smoking wardrobe mistress. Yes Patty Duke as twins.The surprising thing about ""Bigger Than the Sky"" is its touching ending. A colleague has died and the company gathers to honor him in an inventive life-affirming way. Finally it becomes clear that Mr. Corleys film is meant to be a tribute to the love of theater. It has just been posing as the story of one mans finding himself. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Bigger Than the Sky"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity and discreet sexual situations.
