The clumsy pun of its title gives little hint of the charms of ""Bummer Summer"" in which the artless and arty combine to mostly engaging effect. Featuring largely improvised perfs framed inside carefully composed shots this micro-budget black-and-white item examines a couple of days in the early summer life of a trio of college friends. Nothing remarkable happens but the pic is happy to leave it that way avoiding larger meaning. Whats left is clean unpretentious fresh filmmaking that turns its limited resources into a virtue. Fest appearances could improve ""Bummers"" summer. Early scenes feature fresh-faced Isaac (Mackinley Robinson) aimlessly hanging out. As he flicks open a gadget that turns out to be a comb rather than a knife and wanders down empty school corridors we steel ourselves for an ""Elephant""-like shootout that thankfully it never comes. Instead the lack of activity signals the start of summer vacation Isaac hangs out with g.f. Maya (Maya Wood) and then goes to a local concert where he meets up with Ben (helmer Weintraub) and folkie Lila (Julia McAlee) Bens ex. When Maya finds Isaac in a hammock with Lila she breaks up with him. Much of the second half of the film charts the journey of the likable but nondescript trio of Isaac Lila and Ben. Its a lot like an enervated parody of ""On the Road"" and at times the lack of real or emotional drama in the protags lives translates into tedium Among pics strengths is its ability to create comically inconsequential moments as when the three pitch a tent and meet an amiable Russian fellow who wants to borrow vanilla extract. They have some fun on a beach which is where they are free to behave like the kids they still are. Visually this is Jim Jarmusch territory. Shots are challengingly lengthy through the early stretches less so later but theres always something interesting happening in the frame since the helmer has taken great trouble with composition. (Pic was shot entirely in natural light using an SLR camera in video mode). Some strikingly crisp and attentive monochrome images of an attractive area result particularly through the beach section. Thesps are improvising and sometimes they stumble. But more often the slow hesitant rhythms of their exchanges translate into engaging naturalness. Conversation is mostly of the ""kind of I guess"" variety and when emotions come faintly through theyre a welcome relief. But this is not a movie about teen blankness; its just a movie featuring teens who happen to be blank and thats its strength. Tech limitations are presumably responsible for the occasionally close-to-inaudible dialogue. Bummer SummerProductionA Newhard Entertainment production.

Credit Suzanne Tenner/Relativity Media Take the animated adolescent flourishes of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and apply them to a hyperactive childs imagination and you have an idea of the texture of ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" John Schultzs rambunctiously exuberant film featuring Megan McDonalds popular childrens book character.The heroine (played by the Australian dervish Jordana Beatty in her lead American debut evincing the carrot-topped charm of early Lindsay Lohan but at a higher metabolism) painfully says goodbye at school years end to her vacationing best buds Amy (Taylar Hender) and Rocky (Garrett Ryan). Agonized Judy is left with the milquetoast Frank (Preston Bailey) and her younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller winningly annoying) who is obsessed with finding Bigfoot. The season would be a washout if it werent for the arrival of Aunt Opal (Heather Graham wide-eyed bohemian and deftly subordinate to the star) who has come to stay while the parents are off helping an ailing grandfather.Let the avoidance of boredom and the fitful all-important accumulation of ""thrill points"" commence Opal brings tales of exotic travels and best of all shes an artist which dovetails nicely with Judys bric-a-brac aesthetic and gift for fancifully rendered lists.The whole film is a celebration of messy colorful vigorous creativity echoed in Cynthia Charettes gloriously cluttered hodgepodge production design with barely a product placement in sight. Scrawls and doodles flit around characters heads; Judys reveries become eye-blink vignettes of digital animation. Imagery and movement -- not gratuitous destruction -- prevail.

"Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Judy Moody and the Not Bummer SummerThe third-grade heroine is always on the move in the charmless kids film based on Megan McDonalds books.June 10 2011|By Sheri Linden Special to the Los Angeles Times Jordana Beatty right and Preston Bailey in ""Judy Moody and the Not... (Suzanne Tenner Associated...)Feisty but not snarky the protagonist of the Judy Moody series of kids books has a certain retro Beverly Cleary-esque spunk. With her unruly hair and tomboy fearlessness her troublemaking ingenuity and used gum collection Judys a third-grader not a fashionista tween. For her first big-screen incarnation Aussie newcomer Jordana Beatty brings the right wacky willfulness to the part. But apt casting aside ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" is a movie devoid of charm. Creating a new storyline for her bossy heroine author Megan McDonald and co-screenwriter Kathy Waugh are as intent on a mega-escapade as Judy is determined to have a non-boring summer. The relentless action bordering on the frenetic is most definitely not ""rare"" (Judys superlative of choice). With her parents away and her two best friends off on exotic adventures Judy and her little brother Stink (Parris Mosteller who looks and sometimes sounds like the spawn of Boomhauer on ""King of the Hill"") are left in the care of Aunt Opal an artsy-craftsy free spirit played with a surfeit of wide-eyed wonder by Heather Graham. Scoffing at Stinks mission to find Bigfoot Judy embarks on a clunkily connected series of capers/disasters with bespectacled pal Frank (Preston Bailey of ""Dexter""). Director John Schultz (""Aliens in the Attic"") drums up a silly car chase some mildly suspenseful moments and gross-out jokes involving food poop and the ever-popular vomit a apparently obligatory now in all comedies. Cartoony and Crayola-bright the high jinks might entrance very young moviegoers but for all the shenanigans which include not only unsafe driving but politically incorrect candy consumption theres maybe one or two (half-hearted) laughs in store for anyone over 5. Grown-up viewers can at least pass the time looking for familiar faces Eric Stoltzs among them in uncredited cameos. The movie to its credit doesnt pound home any moral conclusions a probably out of sheer exhaustion. Its implied lesson is that Judy should let go of her control-freak goal of ratcheting up ""thrill points"" in a dare race of her own devising. She should just have fun. Too bad then that theres no real joy in all the physical business filling the screen not even in Judys animated daydreams.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Back in my early tweens - of course we were just called kids in those days - I devoured the adventures of my spunky mischievous and amazingly strong fellow redhead Pippi Longstocking in Astrid Lindgrens novels and the dubbed version of the totally awesome 1960s Swedish TV series. So this summers big-screen debut of Judy Moody - the spirited red-haired third-grade heroine of Megan McDonalds wildly popular tween-lit series - brings on a wave of nostalgia accompanied unfortunately by a great big yawn that will surely be experienced by parents hoping for a spark of irreverence a la Pippi or the broad comic appeal found in most theatrical family fare these days. Movies Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer The official trailer Aimed squarely at the tween set Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer is not an adaptation of one or more of the novels but rather a brand-new tale scripted by McDonald and Kathy Waugh (writer for kids shows like Big amp; Small Curious George and Arthur). The movie expands the roster of familiar characters to include Aunt Opal (Heather Graham unleashing her inner child) who shows up to mind Judy (Jordana Beatty) and her younger brother Stink when their parents are suddenly called away to care for a sick relative. This is just the latest in a string of bummers for moody Judy who had mapped out a summer of ""thrill-point"" mega-dares for the gang only to find out one best friend is off to circus camp the other to Borneo. She is left with the nerdy and skittish Frank and her Bigfoot-obsessed little brother. Thankfully her bohemian aunt turns out to be an expert at making lemonade (figuratively speaking of course). But despite its dazzling candy-coloured look and non-stop array of madcap high jinks silly business and gross-out moments (blue puke on the roller coaster bird poop on the sandwiches) Not Bummer Summer will have adult viewers drifting and noticing disturbing things like hey Aunt Opal doesnt remind the kids to put on their seatbelts before tearing up the neighbourhood like a maniac and flipping some kids bouncy castle into the middle of the street without stopping to see if hes okay. The kid survives and so will you but its doubtful this movie will see its way to a sequel. The best thing about Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer is the engaging performance of red-haired Aussie starlet Beatty who will play the titular star in Eloise in Paris. We can only hope that film sticks to the book.

The fearless leader has a plan. We will no longer endure summers filled with boredom; rather we will endure with a regimented points system motivating us toward achieving fun. How does one accumulate Thrill Points? Moodists must set aside all doubts and subject themselves to the challenges of riding roller coasters and walking tightropes and surfing waves and generally bucking against social complacency. But more importantly why does one accumulate Thrill Points? How else would the great Judy fend off the onset of sans-school doldrums? She is no longer the redheaded stepchild of unfulfilled expectations armed to the teeth with trusty acronyms glitter glue and newfound standards of accomplishment. Fun must be won earned dominated -- it is only through competition that we Moodists may demonstrate our true worth to the fearless leader and her spastic cause lest we forget her cries of freedom once her hand was no longer glued to a table in a ploy by the Establishment to prevent her from spreading the truth about the very real threat of summer bummerness. Her struggle against societal norms has been captured well in the timeless cultural document fittingly titled Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer. The animated asides on-screen graphics and constant exaggeration of sounds are necessary to fully convey the hectic lifestyle of -- and breathless progress made by -- our fearless leader and just as director John Schultz took his production design cues from the bravura likes of Bo Welchs The Cat in the Hat one would be wise to model their own domicile after the Moody home when not already modeling ones behavior on Judys. (Even Schultz occasional use of Dutch angles accurately reflects the cock-eyed optimism that is her perpetual mindset.) So find toads and let them pee upon your palms Invite compatriots to spew blue puke in your face Chase down Bigfoot Hunt down Urkel Sign up for Heather Grahams ""I Ate Something Gross"" club Plan your very own poop picnic Allow antic aunts to get behind the wheel and drive down children in neighboring yards with little regard for human life Defy convention and disrespect your closest pals Huff glitter glue and snort Pixy Stix Dont just be sick be sick-awesome And when all else fails dance. Lead your own thrilladelic life my friends Have your own super-cool double-sweet goals Dream the dream of Judy Obey her every whim It is only then that we may know the value of summer and the purest definition of all-American glory.

"Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer review Adults beware Moody is sure to annoy you |       NJ.com comments Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer review Adults beware Moody is sure to annoy you Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 10 2011 at 805 AM updated June 10 2011 at 902 AM View/Post Comments Suzanne TennerJordana Beatty plays the title character in ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer."" Childrens movies used to be made for grown-ups. If youre an adult now theyre the movies you grew up on. They had clear-cut stories recognizable (if fading) stars straightforward filmmaking and a nice safe moral at the end. Because they were mostly made not for your enjoyment but for the approval of the parent who was accompanying you. Thats changed over the last decade or so driven by the huge cable success of Nickelodeon and Disney. They realized it was children who now made the entertainment choices. And it was them not parents to whom they aimed their shows. You can see that sugar-rush aesthetic at work in the not-suitable-for-adults ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer."" Its based on the characters from a childrens book series and made for an independent studio. But artistically it has the kids-cable style down pat. Visually that means lots of distorting wide-angle close-ups neon-bright colors (green is a favorite) and interspersed cartoons title cards and pop-up on-screen words and visuals. Movie Review Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer (PG) Relativity (91 min.) Directed by John Schultz. With Jordana Beatty Heather Graham Jaleel White. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains mildly gross humor and slightly rude words. Stephen Whittys Review ONE STARS Dramatically that means a traditional suburban family -- but with two utterly idiotic and mostly off-screen parents a smart-mouthed star who gets away with everything and a supporting cast of junior weirdos who exist only to get roped into her schemes. There is no moral (not even the mushy ""Believe in yourself"" mantra that Pixar and Disney still insert in every cartoon). There isnt even really any point. There is however throw-up poo pee and lots of running around and screaming. The titular star here -- who is worried that her summer is going to be dull but manages to find some fun anyway -- is Jordana Beatty a not particularly appealing child whos been given an Alfalfa cowlick and encouraged to mug shamelessly. The recognizable grown-ups so-called include the saucer-eyed Heather Graham as an Auntie Mame stand-in and Jaleel White as Judy Moodys third-grade teacher. As Judys hippie-ish Aunt Opal Graham looks -- well slightly insane her eyes two huge blue pools of desperation. (If you saw this character in real life youd cross the street.) As Judys goofy teacher White brings back memories of his long-ago stint as TVs Urkel. They are not happy memories. Apart from the extremely overheated style theres not much in ""Judy Moody"" to keep your interest. Never mind the lack of recognizable adult characters; there isnt a real character in the film besides Judy. Everyone else exists merely to serve her. But then again thats probably how a typical real-life third-grader would describe an absolutely perfect world. And shes the audience this movie was made for.

Starring Heather Graham Jaleel White Preston Bailey Cameron Boyce Janet Varney Ashley Boettcher Jordana Beatty Brian Palermo Megan Franich Ashley Jackson Director John Schultz Running time 131 Release Opened Jun 10 2011  Editorial Review Book heroine strays off the pageBy Sandie Angulo ChenFriday June 10 2011With summer comes theaters filled with superheroes sequels and forgettable family fare. In the last category we find ""Judy Moody.""This flimsy live-action childrens book adaptation follows the titular tomboyish third-grader (Jordana Beatty) dealing with a summer vacation bereft of her two best friends (ones off to Borneo with her journalist mother; the others decamped to circus camp). Judys plan for the summer -- which becomes the bare thread holding this movie together -- involves a ""NOT Bummer Summer"" chart that tracks all the adventures she and a remaining friend hope to accomplish before fall. The first person to 100 ""thrill points"" wins.Judy must perform her feats while stuck at home with her oddball younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller) and her long-lost Aunt Opal (Heather Graham) a free-spirited artist who has traveled the world but cant make a proper meal or remember how to drive. Every time Judy receives a postcard or e-mail from her far-flung friends she tries -- without much success -- to accomplish something boast-worthy such as riding a roller-coaster without holding on or walking a tightrope across two trees. If these tasks dont seem too boast-worthy as you read this theyre not much more exciting when you see them on screen. Director John Schultz (""Aliens in the Attic"") tries but fails to keep the attention of anyone older than 8. Its a shame really because Judy Moody in the boisterous spirit of Pippi Longstocking and Ramona Quimby is a chapter-book protagonist whos hard not to love. In print Judy is creative and curious and ""totally awesome"" but everything that makes her a joy in Megan McDonalds books makes her surprisingly annoying on screen. The books extravagantly long phrases that are such a delight to read aloud (""Mega Total Super Seriously"") sound obnoxious when delivered by Beatty. Judy isnt the kind of young heroine a movie audience roots for no matter how hard Beatty tries. And thats because the story doesnt offer much of a satisfying journey. Judys not battling an evil wizard a menacing older brother or the schools social hierarchy. Shes just trying to force herself to have a better summer than her friends. Its not exactly the stuff of legend. . . or even the laughable adventures of a Wimpy Kid. The humor is basic (blue vomit poop sandwiches hands glued to tables) even by elementary-school standards. The tween slapstick will elicit the stray laugh but only from the youngest filmgoers. A subplot centered on Judys teacher Mr. Todd holds no interest except that a grown-up Jaleel White a.k.a. Steve Urkel plays him. And while Graham nails the ethereal aunt who amuses her charges by building a giant papier-mache Big Foot on the lawn or decorating garbage-can lid hats she cant make this movie NOT a bummer.Some may question why the studios would release such a mediocre uninspired kid movie just when school lets out. But if nothing else ""Judy Moody"" offers parents an excuse to nap in air-conditioned comfort. Contains mild rude humor and language.

(Smokewood Entertainment) Joe Neumaier Friday June 10 2011 400 AM Title Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer A third-graders efforts to have a great vacation involve her aunt and little brother (131). PG. At area theaters.The number of good movies for grade-school girls - the ones who may have outgrown Disney but are too young for Bella Swan - could fit on the side of a spangled Skechers sneaker.Despite plenty of source material the Hollywood boys clubs cant grasp that there are some young moviegoers who can get into ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" but also deserve a scrappy scampy role model that looks like them.For that audience ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" isnt just ""Rare"" as its title heroine would say - its a seriously perfect vacation destination.On her last day of third grade messy-haired redhead Judy (Jordana Beatty) is majorly bummed because unlike most of her pals shes not going away to a cool camp or even leaving her small Virginia town.Then to make matters worse her parents announce that they have to visit a sick grandparent out of state so Judys Aunt Opal - whom she hasnt seen in forever and who has a reputation as a flighty globe-trotter - is coming to kid-sit Judy and her little brother Stink (Parris Mosteller).But it turns out Opal (Heather Graham) is inventive and full of energy just like her niece. And soon Judy her dorky pal Frank (Preston Bailey) and Opal are finding new ways to make the warm-weather days go by like creating guerrilla art and going on a hunt for Stinks new obsession Sasquatch after the local news reports several hairy sightings in the neighborhood.It sounds simple yet the witty screenplay by Kathy Waugh and ""Judy Moody"" novelist Megan McDonald is actually a wacky spin on the backyard-exploration adventures in ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""Judy Frank and Opal fill their sandal-clad days and lamp-lit silly-dance-filled nights with imagination while trying to find the secret of Bigfoot. Rarely has a film caught the timeless appeal of finding your own fun and avoided looking hokey.Director John Schultz gives this book-series adaptation the right amount of visual snap without going overboard as so many live-action family films do. But the real color comes courtesy of Graham and Beatty.The former bubbly and apple-sweet as ever embodies a spirit of rebellion and creativity that will click with audiences 7 and up. The latter a young Aussie actress who seems as all-American as a Magic 8 ball successfully walks the tightrope from precocious to exuberant never once falling into obnoxiousness.That could describe this crackerjack of a kids movie as well.

""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" is sure to appeal to kids of all ages from 6 to 9 who are female and have no taste or sense of humor. Tomorrows Chicos shoppers have to come from somewhere I suppose. The film centers on the paradox of Kid Summer -- you cant wait for it to begin you are bored when it does. Yet those who dare to make films about boredom should beware of succeeding too well. PHOTOS MOVIES BASED ON SUCCESSFUL CHILDRENS BOOKS Third-grader Judy (Jordana Beatty an Australian actress with pleasingly uncontrollable red hair) is a grumpy suburban kid who chafes as her best friends go off to learn to be lion tamers at circus camp or swim with sharks in Borneo. Like Judy we are stuck doing nothing much -- um why cant we be watching a movie about cool stuff like that? Instead so starved is Judy for ideas that as she might put it AN HOUR INTO THE MOVIE her Aunt Opal (Heather Graham) says maybe they should both Google ""fun."" Kid cinema isnt like ""Old Yeller"" anymore is it? And yet -- its so much sadder. I didnt even know kids were still capable of being bored. I was but I didnt have the Internet 500 cable channels or texting. In that first hour the movie has no plot just a lot of teeth grinding and epic-fail slapstick as Judy builds a chart and fills it up with a to-do list of activities she believes would be thrilling but never are -- for her or us. An effort to surf is curtailed by a jellyfish attack. She tries to walk a tightrope 4 feet over a stream then falls in. She and her little brother Stink Moody (which would have been a far more accurate title for the movie) open their mouths while chewing peas. While decorating garbage-can lids with her Aunt Opal a groovy Peace Corps-and-yoga type Judy gets her hand stuck on her art project. Idly I began to wonder whether my 9-year-old self had it right on this subject as on so many others Maybe girls are simply far more boring than boys? The boy-centric ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" looks like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in comparison to the squinched vision and lack of imagination here. And the only good ideas on offer are those of Stink (Parris Mosteller). Hes on a quest to find Bigfoot. Meanwhile his sister and the aunt want to . . . go to the library so they can place the garbage-can lids on statues of lions. Or try on bracelets and mood rings. In a few years the lad is going to be ready to be a character in ""Red Dawn."" His sister -- maybe ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" A trip to a creepy abandoned amusement park threatens to at least make things a bit ""Scooby-Doo"" -- but nothing happens except the kids notice there are smears of poop on their sandwiches. They put them down scream and leave. Eventually even Judy realizes her small brother has better ideas than she does so she abandons being lame and acts more like him. The two of them spend the last 20 minutes trying to find Bigfoot in the neighborhood and at one point think they see the brute climbing into an ice-cream truck. This would have been a perfect time for a cameo by that human Sasquatch Robin Williams or at least a rip-off of ""Harry and the Hendersons"" but the movies budget doesnt allow for either of these things and disappointment reigns again. The mystery is why the filmmakers thought third-graders or anyone else would be willing to pay for this master class in tedium. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Rapper Flo Rida busted for DUI in worlds most expensive c...

"Annoying Judy Moody turns out to be a bummer - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Annoying Judy Moody turns out to be a bummer By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer is bound to put you in a bum mood. By Suzanne Tenner Relativity Media Heather Graham plays Aunt Opal to Jordana Beattys spunky Judy Moody. EnlargeClose By Suzanne Tenner Relativity Media Heather Graham plays Aunt Opal to Jordana Beattys spunky Judy Moody. Though the lead actress newcomer Jordana Beatty gives a spunky performance as third-grader Judy her characters borderline bratty charm wears thin fast. Mostly its undercut by the movies irritatingly antic slapstick style. Megan McDonald author of the popular childrens book series co-wrote the script. Based on this exaggerated story she should stick to novels. On the page her quirky dialogue might be enjoyable but the movie lines feel forced and unlike anything an actual 8-year-old would utter. Judy speaks in ""cutesy-ese"" issuing ""toad-ally cool mega-rare not bummer summer dares."" Judy is determined to have the most thrilling summer ever but things dont go as planned. Her best friends are whisked off to more exotic venues like Borneo and circus camp. (Some of that plays like a Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? episode.) Her parents take off to help an ailing grandparent so Judy is left in the care of her free-spirited Aunt Opal (Heather Graham). But Judy still has to contend with her Bigfoot-obsessed little brother Stink (Parris Mosteller). To fill the bill as a zany lovable aunt Graham smiles a lot and opens her eyes wider than usual. Her idea of adventure is endangering her niece and nephew as she drives recklessly over sidewalks and crashes into things steals a kids bike and lets her charges roam the city alone at night. If this were anything resembling real life Aunt Opals babysitting gaffes might result in child-endangerment charges. A guerrilla artist Aunt Opal does at least encourage Judys imagination. But the message of finding fun in ones own creative impulses gets lost amid the frenzied calculated whimsy. About the film Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer  1/2 out of four Stars Jordana Beatty Heather Graham Preston Bailey Parris Mosteller Director John Schultz Distributor Relativity Media Rating PG for some mild rude humor and language Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Judys adventures include a search for Bigfoot with two strangers in a van. (Theres a wise idea.) She goes to a scary movie dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein but her pal Frank (Preston Bailey) runs off terrified. Another time they take a vomitous roller-coaster ride. The film has a candy-colored cartoonish look (augmented by computer-animated dream sequences) and a hyperactive pace perhaps meant for the ADD crowd. But when it comes to excitement Moody falls flat. True to her last name Judy does a lot of flouncing off to her room in a snit insisting she wont emerge again for the rest of the summer. If only. Sadly her attention span is short and she pops out for more escapades. For more entertaining tween girl empowerment movies stay home and rent A Little Princess (1995) Harriet the Spy (1996) Mulan (1998) or Kit Kittredge An American Girl (2008). Judy Moody should have been a breezy lighthearted romp but its more incessantly frantic than fun. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Credit Suzanne Tenner/Relativity Media Take the animated adolescent flourishes of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and apply them to a hyperactive childs imagination and you have an idea of the texture of ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" John Schultzs rambunctiously exuberant film featuring Megan McDonalds popular childrens book character.The heroine (played by the Australian dervish Jordana Beatty in her lead American debut evincing the carrot-topped charm of early Lindsay Lohan but at a higher metabolism) painfully says goodbye at school years end to her vacationing best buds Amy (Taylar Hender) and Rocky (Garrett Ryan). Agonized Judy is left with the milquetoast Frank (Preston Bailey) and her younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller winningly annoying) who is obsessed with finding Bigfoot. The season would be a washout if it werent for the arrival of Aunt Opal (Heather Graham wide-eyed bohemian and deftly subordinate to the star) who has come to stay while the parents are off helping an ailing grandfather.Let the avoidance of boredom and the fitful all-important accumulation of ""thrill points"" commence Opal brings tales of exotic travels and best of all shes an artist which dovetails nicely with Judys bric-a-brac aesthetic and gift for fancifully rendered lists.The whole film is a celebration of messy colorful vigorous creativity echoed in Cynthia Charettes gloriously cluttered hodgepodge production design with barely a product placement in sight. Scrawls and doodles flit around characters heads; Judys reveries become eye-blink vignettes of digital animation. Imagery and movement -- not gratuitous destruction -- prevail.

Aunt Opal (Heather Graham left) devises a competition between Judy (Jordana Beatty) and her friends in an attempt to make summer vacation fun. Photo Relativity Media Suzanne Tenner Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Judy Moody is one cute kid quirky creative and adventurous her bright face framed with a tangle of red hair. As Pippi Longstocking proved more than 65 years ago carrot-topped pistols make fine heroines for little girls. Megan McDonalds Judy Moody series is hugely justly popular with the barrette set a fact I can confirm from the books that have knocked around my house over the past 11 years. Why its taken so long for an adaptation to hit the big screen escapes me considering the whining power of the tween demographic and the buying power of their much-badgered parental units. So here finally is Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer directed by Aliens in the Attics John Schultz from a script by Kathy Waugh and McDonald. Jordana Beatty the wee thing in the title role has the requisite supply of hair and spunk. Parris Mosteller the squirt playing her kid brother Stink seems to be having fun. But thats the best I can say for this canned piece of so-called family entertainment which slathers on the bright colors and peppy eccentricity -- it looks like an exploding art project - but fails to capture the books childlike voice and essential grumbling charm. Schools out. Judys worried about vacation which threatens to become ""the worst double-drat bummer summer ever"" when one buddy Amy (Taylar Hender) flies off to Borneo for the season and another buddy Rocky (Garrett Ryan) heads to circus camp. Then her nice daffy parents (Kristoffer Winters and Janet Varney) fly to California leaving Judy and Stink in the care of their hippy-dippy Aunt Opal (Heather Graham in full flower-child form). Judy soon bonds with Opal who inspires her to turn her dashed dreams of summer excitement into a competition with her friends whoever scores the most ""thrill points"" wins. This bodes ill for Judy and a third buddy Frank (Preston Bailey) both of them stuck in suburban Virginia while Amys gallivanting about the rain forest and Rockys sawing people in half. Things go from bad to worse when Frank pukes on her at the amusement park. Then Opal uses poop as a condiment while assembling a picnic. Judy Moody takes aim at average kids frustrations (e.g. being bored out of your head during summer break) but the whole thing is Hollywood-ized to the brink of lunacy Judy and Frank cant simply take in a horror movie or two they have to dress up in full flaming Frankenstein costumes with 6-inch platform shoes. Its the sort of childrens film that subjects its young protagonist to serial humiliations as an excuse for a plot; when in doubt just embarrass the poor kid in public. Two key subplots - one involving Big Foot the other a ""mystery"" (or not) starring Jaleel White as a zany school teacher - unfold with utmost obviousness. A few bland computer-animated segments are wedged in to illustrate Judys fantasy life but they dont add much. It all seems forced. And its a far cry from the moody sprite of McDonalds books who always knows a bummer when she sees one. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Titanium Drill Bit 115-Piece Set for 30 + pickup at Home Depot GameStop Summer Sale Keter Manor 4x6-Foot Storage Shed for 339 + pickup at Walmart Best Buy Clearance amp; Open-Box items Up to 50% off + free...

McDonalds popular books seem to fill a need for young readers particularly girls thirsting for heroines who are creative daring and funny.Australian redhead Jordana Beatty makes a fetching debut in an original script by McDonald and childrens television writer Kathy Waugh about what happens when Judys best-laid plans to have the most thrilling summer ever go astray.It seems she didnt count on two of her best friends going away. Or her mom and dad heading off to California leaving her with Aunt Opal (played with offbeat charm by Heather Graham) and little brother Stink (in a spunky no-apologies turn by Parris Mosteller) who is obsessed with finding Bigfoot.Give director John Schultz who also helmed the appealing Like Mike credit for keeping the motor humming even when you know where this car is careening. He goes for some real thrills including a roller coaster ride called the Scream Monster (convincingly portrayed by Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles) where Judy gets vomited on by Frank (played with affecting earnestness by Preston Bailey) her second-best friend and fellow member of the Toad Pee Club.After a series of comic mishaps Judy learns as John Lennon once said ""Life is what happens to you while youre busy making other plans.""And shades of Ramona bonding with her Aunt Bea Judy discovers that Aunt Opal is a lot cooler and a lot more like Judy than shed realized.Which leaves us with a question Can a Junie B.

But events conspire against her. More about Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer >> The plot mirrors the film itself An ambitious attempt to adapt Megan McDonalds book series to the screen that for all its breeziness never quite gets its kite off the ground. Judy Moody has some enjoyable ingredients. The cast for instance rocks it especially young Aussie actress Jordana Beatty as the title character a bottle rocket with unruly red hair. Heather Graham also charms as Aunt Opal the dazzlingly free-spirited relative who comes to take care of Judy and her younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller). This self-described ""guerrilla artist"" is like an Auntie Mame for prepubescents. Also popping up in the ensemble are Jaleel White (Steve Urkel on TVs Family Matters) as Judys imaginative teacher Mr. Todd and Janet Varney cohost of TBSs Dinner and a Movie as her myopic mother. Director John Schultz ushers the film along with a brisk visual brio that still manages to feel perfunctory. The story is patched together with the extraneous thread of Stinks Bigfoot obsession. Theres a faint but unmistakable air of pretense to the project too many adult thumbprints on Judys Magic 8 Ball. And its a little distracting that Beatty looks like a mature middle schooler rather than the perennial third grader of the books. The result is a film thats energetic but not entirely engaging fun but never truly funny. Its like being at a party Kate Gosselin is throwing for her sextuplets The frivolity feels strained.

Share Tweet So heres a philosophical question for modern cinephiles Is it a positive development that the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is moving on to new spheres by appearing in movies other than mopey modern indie dramas or exasperating that the stereotype is not only persisting but expanding? In Judy Moody And The Not Bummer Summer--an ice-cream headache of a film inspired by Megan McDonalds Judy Moody childrens-book series--Heather Graham stars as possibly the first wacky quirky painfully effervescent MPDG in charge of cheering up a sullen grade-schooler instead of a sullen man in need of romantic rescue. Graham flings herself into the role squealing and bouncing and bringing madcap bohemian art projects and personal emotional validation into the life of her young niece the eponymous Judy (Jordana Beatty). But Graham is far from the most manic thing about Judy Moody. Beattys character is a comically hyperbolic drama queen in training; when she finds out her parents and two of her best friends will be out of town all summer she pendulums back and forth between throwing outsized diva pout-fits and brokering a competition to see who can make the summer most ""thrilladelic"" and ""uber-rare"" with a series of adventurous dares. The plot is simple but director John Schultz (Aliens In The Attic Like Mike) punches it up with a visually garish aesthetic somewhere between Pee-wees Playhouse and a low-budget Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World The colorfully dressed characters wear their hair in cartoony Tim Burton flips or wild tangles. They squeal or yell their lines. They leave animated speed trails hanging in the air when they zoom by. Words numbers and animated fantasies pop up in mid-air to emphasize the action. Its all as crowded and goofy as a car full of clowns. Judy Moody And The Not Bummer Summer is in many ways the spiritual sibling of the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies Both center on comically self-absorbed fantasy-prone kids with delusions of grandeur and heightened senses of drama suitable for the big emotions and silly-fits of a protected indulgent childhood. But the Wimpy Kid movies at least let their protagonist grow a little and learn a few lessons whereas in Judy Moody Beatty mostly learns that the world does revolve around her helpful supportive manic aunt and all. Not that anything in Judy Moody is meant to be taken seriously--or could be even if it was meant to--but even for sugary neon fluff its awfully lightweight. Its like something an MPDG cobbled together out of Silly String and glitter in order to get an emo kid to smile for a few minutes.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Some movies make you remember being a child. Some movies treat you like one. ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer does both. This is good news for the 8-year-olds whove read Megan McDonalds books which began to arrive in 2000. They might not mind the movies relentless determination to be both an arts-and-crafts project and dessert. The percussive shakers on the soundtrack evoke nothing less than an industrial-strength sifter dumping powdered sugar on everything. Song lyrics and choice bits of synonymous dialogue (""Poop ""Scat) attack the screen like gnats.This tale appears to have been concocted independent of McDonalds books but made to embody their spirit. (McDonald and Kathy Waugh are the screenwriters.) The result is funky -- and not only because Judy (Jordana Beatty) a fourth-grader-to-be has orange hair that might be dreadlocking on its own or because her blond crew-cut Bigfoot-obsessed brothers name is Stink (Parris Mosteller) or because she and Stink almost eat a turd sandwich. What reeks is Judys way of the world. The only way she can enjoy her school vacation is by quantifying and commodifying fun. To keep track of her adventures and those of her friends she whips up a chart that assigns point values to such tasks as freeze-dancing.The charts urgency intensifies after Judy discovers that her pals will be farther flung than shell be and that her severely hippy-dippy Aunt Opal (Heather Graham) has arrived to watch her and Stink while mom and dad visit grandma. She and Stink may as well have been left alone. Judy is beyond discipline shame self-awareness collaboration or compromise. A new friend calls Judy sick and Judy offers a clarification ""Sick awesome When her long-suffering best buddy Frank (Preston Bailey) calls her a fun sponge she calls him a fun mop. Anything that deviates from Judys wishes is a buzz kill and warrants a retaliatory tantrum. Shes the mutant version of Beverly Clearys Ramona.John Schultz directed ""Judy Moody and his instructions to Beatty appear to have been ""No. Way brattier Luckily despite her obnoxious energy she has a twinkle of wonder mostly when she gazes at Jaleel White who plays Judys teacher. She looks TV-star-struck ""You. Were. Urkel. But if you asked Judy who her favorite actress is shed probably say Miley Cyrus. Schultzs advice for the other children is ""OK run and scream and by children I might also mean Graham. Its nice to see her working with actors her own age.Mosteller might be the movies real discovery. He twists his lisp and slurry speech around the dialogue in a way that exudes far less attitude than the kids. Hes spunky but hasnt been corrupted by the slanguage the way his pre-tween costars have. Theres still something authentic and authentically manic about him. McDonald also wrote a bunch of books about Stink. At the risk of being careless about what I wish for Id rather watch a movie of those.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer Bad Director John Schultz. Cast Jordana Beatty Heather Graham Parris Mosteller. Rating PG for mild rude humor and language. This weeks new movie releases Kids books that became movies In ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" director John Schultzs film based on the popular childrens books by Megan McDonald (who also co-wrote the screenplay) Judys mom and some other characters wear what look like Harry Potter specs. Theyre too hip too self-consciously offbeat. Come on. Nobody wears glasses like those. The move is just begging the audience to think of it as cool and falls as flat as hearing your parents sing along to songs you like on the radio. 10 films with kids banding together Judy Moody author Megan McDonald Of course if ridiculous eyewear was the only problem with ""Judy Moody"" it could be overcome. Its not. The story is a grab bag of only-in-the-movies kid problems and ridiculous adult behavior. Kids arent stupid; they know parents dont always act like dopes (though ahem sometimes). Its too bad because relative newcomer Jordana Beatty shows promise as Judy a little girl who develops a foolproof (read unworkable) system for surviving summer. But the script leaves her character whiny and bratty somewhat reminiscent of the title character in the first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movie. Arent we supposed to like these kids? On the other hand bonus points for including Urkel (Jaleel White) in the cast As the film begins Judy is going to great lengths to stave off what was at least to me a heretofore unknown problem the boredom of summer vacation. She develops a plan complete with a poster for awarding points for fun things that happen. Her idea is to work on this with a couple of pals but they have other more interesting things to do for the summer (circus camp and Borneo). So shes stuck with her little brother and Bigfoot fanatic Stink (Parris Mosteller) as well as second-best-friend Frank (Preston Bailey). Whats more her parents - Janet Varney is the glasses-wearing mom - are going to California leaving Judy with Aunt Opal (Heather Graham) a free-spirited hippie artist who leads her into all sorts of misadventures. This naturally is far more fun than anything any other kid is doing over the summer but it takes Judy the better part of an hour and a half to figure this out. As she does Judy uses self-aware lingo (""rare"" is a favorite synonym for ""cool"") and in her blindness to the good time shes actually having neglects friends family and whomever else might happen along. It gives nothing away to note that Judys summer is not a bummer. The same alas cant be said for the film.

Shes so manic she thinks summer is boring. To avoid a bummer summer she assigns ""thrill points"" to various activities that all end up disasters She falls into a river while tightrope-walking gets splattered with Sno-Cone barf on a roller coaster etc. The lesson is that fun cant be planned but the film is so airless (think iCarly as a videogame) that there isnt a truly playful moment in it.

Adapted from Megan McDonalds kids books John Schultzs tale mistakes hyperactivity for humor in recounting the vacation blues of third-grader Judy (Jordana Beatty) an eccentric messy-redheaded faux-Ramona who determined to have the best summer ever by competing against friends in daredevil challenges has her plans complicated by the unexpected departure of her BFFs and the arrival of zany Aunt Opal (Heather Graham). Schultzs style is belligerently cartoonish--kaleidoscopic colors extreme close-ups on-screen bubble letters computer-animation daydreams--and he quickly transforms the action into a grotesquerie of forced whimsy and wackiness in which Judys attempts to achieve adventurous bliss lead to vomiting and poop. Vainly striving to deliver tween empowerment the rollicking story advocates embracing ones inner idiosyncratic spirit. Yet the incessant tumult drowns out any real message for the kids--or pleasure for their parents. Its a film so obnoxiously frantic that its most restrained element is a banjo-strumming elementary school teacher played by none other than 90s tween-mugging icon Jaleel ""Urkel"" White.

The latest attempt to mine a seemingly bottomless cache of tween-oriented literature ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" strives to capture the insouciance of Megan McDonalds popular book series but overshoots its comedic potential. Though McDonald herself co-wrote the adaptation pic comes off as an exaggerated slapstick romp rather than the breezy affecting tale of an 8-year-old tomboy it might have been. With slight theatrical prospects item will nonetheless exploit its built-in name recognition for an extended shelf life of home viewing like a jar of preservative-laden gumballs that should have expired but cant. Whereas the recent ""Ramona and Beezus"" and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" pics managed to replicate some of the best aspects of the books that inspired them ""Judy Moody"" hasnt fared as well. There are obvious and superficial commonalities to be sure Strong-willed Judy like Ramona Quimby and ""Wimpy Kids"" Greg Heffley grapples with peer pressure family power struggles and homespun disasters. But McDonalds quirky prose and character-specific dialogue as enlivened by Peter Reynolds evocative sketches are enhanced by the imagination. Onscreen dialogue like ""toad-ally cool"" feels well totally ridiculous. Third-grader Judy (Australian Jordana Beatty) has a shock of red hair that like her moods cant be tamed. Her younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller) is an endless source of irritation to her and she regularly feels misunderstood. Things get a whole lot worse when she learns her friends have exotic summer plans (one heads to circus camp the other to Borneo) and her parents will be taking a trip without her. Enter Judy and Stinks wacky Aunt Opal (Heather Graham overdoing it). Though Judy is initially reluctant to welcome her Opal helps Judy devise a ""thrill chart"" to record her most exciting adventures. Opals own sure-to-dazzle ideas include making trashcan-lid sombreros and a papier-mache Bigfoot. (Finding Bigfoot is one of Stinks obsessions.) To her credit Beatty grins and bears it doing the best she can with the thin material. Likewise young Mosteller is an agreeable presence. But helmer John Schultz (""Aliens in the Attic"") goes the route of caricature early on a choice emphasized by Cynthia Kay Charettes candy-colored production design and Richard Gibbs goofily overzealous soundtrack. Consequently the proceedings start to resemble a carnival attraction not unlike the ill-fated roller-coaster ride Judy shares with her pal Frank (Preston Bailey). In the end its hard to know which is more disconcerting the fact that the camera never stops moving or that Grahams forehead barely moves at all.

Daily Edition Login to download Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer Film Review 1200 AM PDT 6/3/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Media A for-small-children movie that excludes everyone else. TWITTER The film directed by John Schultz follows the adventures of a third grader played by Australian newcomer Jordana Beatty who is determined to have a ""mega-cool"" summer; Heather Graham co-stars. In making family entertainment some movies pitch a tent high and wide enough to let in the entire family while others set up a tiny tent to include only very small children and a few bored older ones who must accompany their younger siblings. Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer definitely pitches the tiny tent. Since the film is based on a popular childrens book series with a reported 13 million copies in print worldwide the film from Relativity Media may enjoy a prosperous theatrical opening and more extended play as a DVD or download. But woe onto anyone over the age of say 10 who wanders into a cinema. This one is not for you. The film chronicles the adventures of third grader Judy Moody who is played with considerable spunk by Australian newcomer Jordana Beatty. Judy is determined to have a ""mega-cool"" summer with the help of younger brother Stink (Parris Mosteller) and her free-spirit Aunt Opal (Heather Graham). No you didnt read that wrong. Graham is definitely a good sport in this movie where she plays an adult who is lets say very much in touch with her inner child. The quality of Judys summer involves something called ""thrill points"" which are vaguely defined and even more vaguely acquired. Or not acquired in the case of the somewhat moody Judy who doesnt think shes having a great summer at all until its all over. There is little story here as such. Mostly the film evolves in a series of slapsticky episodes that feature chases a tightrope walk hunts for Big Foot horror costumes and far too much junk food. There are also gags involving vomit and poo. Although when Aunt Opal drives a car recklessly with her niece and nephew aboard you do wonder what the joke is meant to be. Occasionally digital cartoons or on-screen graphics briefly take over the narrative. The film directed by John Schultz (Like MikeAliens in the Attic) from a script by the author and Kathy Waugh wants to put on screen the sense of random play and concentrated games that fill a childs world for a few summers. In this it succeeds but the film does not welcome others who might still retain memories of those NOT bummer summers. Tech credits are solid.
