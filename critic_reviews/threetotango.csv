More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Even with Neve Campbell (""Scream"" ""Party of Five"") providing marquee allure pic will likely skew toward a slightly older (and largely female) demographic. This lightweight item should enjoy a modestly profitable waltz through megaplexes before doing a quick two-step into ancillary venues. With a nod toward ""The Apartment"" and a tip of the hat to ""Any Wednesday"" ""Three to Tango"" plays like an updated version of the frothy and wisecracky romantic comedies that were Broadway and Hollywood staples throughout the 1960s. Even with Neve Campbell (""Scream"" ""Party of Five"") providing marquee allure for teens and early-twentysomethings pic will likely skew toward a slightly older (and largely female) demographic. Well cast and wittily written this lightweight item should enjoy a modestly profitable waltz through megaplexes before doing a quick two-step into ancillary venues. First-time feature helmer Damon Santostefano gets things off to a bang-up start with a vivacious credits sequence set to the insistent swing music of the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Pace slackens only slightly as the plot machinery smoothly slips into first gear introducing ambitious Chicago architects Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt). The two longtime friends are the underdogs as they compete with a more successful duo (John C. McGinley Bob Balaban) for a multimillion-dollar building restoration project funded by health-conscious tycoon Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott). But thanks to a series of mixed signals and mistaken assumptions -- fueled paradoxically by their business rivals -- Oscar and Peter gain a dubious advantage. Charles fancies himself an open-minded freethinking sophisticate. At least thats how he wants his perky mistress struggling artist Amy Post (Campbell) to think he views himself. When his secretary repeats gossip about Oscars sexual orientation -- hes rumored to be gay -- the tycoon makes a big show of not being the least bit homophobic. (Hopelessly heterosexual the clueless Oscar initially doesnt realize what Charles is talking about when he refers to ""you people."") More important Charles indicates that he would give Oscar and Peter preferential consideration for the restoration project if Oscar would perform a little favor for him. Since Charles cant always be with his young beloved -- after all he does have to spend some time with his wife (Kelly Rowan) -- he needs someone to ""keep an eye"" on her. Specifically he wants Oscar to attend Amys art-gallery opening and maintain surveillance in case she gravitates back to ex-boyfriend Kevin Cartwright (Cylk Cozart) a superstar football player. Predictably Oscar falls for Amy as soon as he spots her at the art gallery. The evening is less of a mating dance than a comedy of errors when Amy invites Oscar to an after-hours reception. After a series of physical and culinary mishaps -- they recklessly dine on tuna melts at a greasy spoon then walk outside to upchuck their dinners -- they wind up back at her apartment. But Charles drops by before anything amorous occurs. The rest of pic revolves around Oscars reluctant resolve to continue the pretense and much of the fun stems from Oscars being a tad too successful at passing himself off as homosexual. Charles wants the ""safe"" architect to continue keeping tabs on his mistress. Peter -- who is gay and more than a little amused by his friends discomfort at being perceived as such -- encourages Oscar to keep on playing the game in the hope of currying Charles favor. Despite sporting a distracting retro hairdo -- think of David Hemming or Tom Courtenay in a mid-60s Brit pic -- Perry makes a thoroughly ingratiating impression as a goodhearted guy who paints himself into a tight corner. Wisely he refrains from swishy excess and limp-wristed caricature while playing a heterosexual whos pretending to be gay. Indeed he doesnt behave any differently than when hes supposed to be straight -- which of course underscores the message of live-and-let-live tolerance thats inherent in the script by Rodney Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna. Upbeat wrap-up of the plot complications is blithely unbelievable even on the level of feel-good Hollywood fantasy. But before it trips over itself while dashing toward a happily-ever-after ending ""Three to Tango"" is a smart and sassy comedy with a playful sensibility and subtle sensitivity. It boasts clever tweaking of all kinds of sexual stereotyping. Campbell effectively plays Amy as a thick-skinned softhearted gamin whose self-esteem has seriously depreciated after years of repeatedly selling herself short. McDermott once again scores by playing against his leading-man good looks rendering Charles as a fatuous egotist who isnt nearly as smart as he thinks. Platt gleefully steals every scene that isnt nailed to the floor while Cozart handles a tricky role with admirable aplomb and conviction. Tech credits are first-rate across the board with lenser Walt Lloyd and production designer David Nichols greatly enhancing the overall glossiness of the enterprise. The eclectic soundtrack emphasizes swing selections that keep things moving with appropriate exuberance.

Starring Matthew Perry Neve Campbell Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt. Directed by Damon Santostefano. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Three to Tango"" is a charming romantic comedy in the ""Tootsie"" vein in which a man and woman are able to establish a close friendship because the woman wrongly believes that the man is not romantically interested. Matthew Perry plays a fellow who is assumed to be gay and for various reasons he cant reveal the truth. The picture takes that farcical situation and works it for every scrap of humor. Perry plays Oscar a Chicago architect who with his partner (Oliver Platt) is in the running for a contract worth 90 million. Neve Campbell is Amy a 30-ish artist who is involved with a married man. Campbell hardly seems 30-ish. She is not convincing as an artist. And the perky personality she adopts rings false. Yet overall she is fine in the movie. Some mysteries of cinema cannot be unlocked by criticism so why pretend? The couple is first thrown together when Oscars boss has Oscar whom he believes to be gay spy on his lover who turns out to be Amy. The two hit it off. Amy moves in with Oscar undresses in front of him and invites him into the room when she is taking a bath. In one scene she tells him in detail about her one lesbian experience while he tries to conceal a painful case of lust. ""Three to Tango"" -- the title incidentally makes no sense -- has fun compounding Oscars discomfort. Women confide in him. Men come on to him. Eventually he has the disconcerting experience of becoming a gay public figure a straight man in the closet. Perry is at his best playing frenetic confusion and he exists in that state for most of the film. ..

Then I saw Three to Tango. The Friends costar has once again taken a role disturbingly similar to his prime-time alter ego Like Chandler Bing Chicago architect Oscar Novak is a neurotically fastidious wisenheimer who tends to babble around beautiful women and is widely assumed to be gay. Just such a misunderstanding propels Tangos tired plot. Thought to pose no heterosexual threat Oscar is asked by philandering germ-phobic -- dare I say Trumpesque? -- tycoon Charles Newman (The Practices Dylan McDermott) to spy on his glassblowing mistress Amy Post (Neve Campbell). Who couldve predicted Oscar would fall for her? Okay aside from anyone whos ever seen a painfully schematic farce. Friends allows Perry to display his precise comic timing on a weekly basis but even he cant save stale lines like ""I have no problem with homosexuality especially when it happens between two gorgeous women. Or three."" As his professional partner who -- ready? -- really is gay the equally talented Oliver Platt sinks to mincing limp-wristed shtick. McDermott and Campbell fare even worse. McDermotts natural earnestness serves him well as attorney Bobby Donnell on The Practice but he shows zero flair for comedy. And just as in the Scream films Campbell seems incapable of shedding her Party of Five mannerisms -- the sidelong laugh the singsong cadence. Its as if San Francisco orphan Julia Salinger moved to Illinois and became an avant-garde adulteress. Shot in depressingly washed-out tones by director Damon Santostefano (whose only previous credit is the 1992 Garrett Morris gore movie Severed Ties) Tango wants to have it both ways. First-time screenwriters Rodney Patrick Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKennas script periodically creaks to a halt to preach a condescending message of tolerance of gay people. Yet it just as often makes cheap jokes at their expense. In one gag given prominent play in the films TV ads Oscars dad puts a bucket over his head and bangs it against a wall after reading an erroneous newspaper report trumpeting his offsprings homosexuality. Its a mean-spirited little scene but after suffering through Three to Tango I know exactly how that father feels.
