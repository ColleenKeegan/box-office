Plus Were the Millers comes close and The Canyons crash-lands. by Wesley Morris on August 8 2013 Elysium is a smart handsome severely conscientious intermittently entertaining diversion that wants you to think without having to overthink to feel but not too much to achieve timeliness without you looking down at your watch. It wants you to be irate at such abstract injustices as social and economic inequality while perhaps not noticing that the movie itself is situated upon a version of that very imbalance. Its adventurous and aggravatingly conventional at the same time full of both allegorical ideas about revolution and cute kids pulling at the coattails of grown men. The writer and director Neill Blomkamp seems sad having to set to his movie in the Los Angeles of the future in a 2154 thats dusty and dehydrated strewn with trash and debris and graffiti. He seems sad that he has to make this movie that we still arent the world. Hes crying Why arent we? In Elysium everyone is Latin off-Latin or Boerish. More than once the camera floats up above the earth and gives you dilapidated shacks for as far as the eye can see. It looks like Soweto or parts of Rio de Janeiro on infinite repeat. In the opening minutes titles explain that those images stand in for the entire planet which is ""diseased polluted and vastly overpopulated."" They tell us that the wealthy -- whites and one Indian president whos revealed to be virtually powerless -- have decamped to a not-too-distant spoked wheel called Elysium which hangs mockingly visible from the streets of Los Angeles like an astral hood ornament. The people of L.A. stagnate while residents of the synthetically verdant-looking wheel resemble figures in most architecture mockups. Rebellious Angelenos hop into spaceships that speed up toward the wheel only to have its defense secretary -- the steely owner of a platinum-blonde bob named Delacourt whos played by Jodie Foster -- arrange to shoot them down. Madame Secretary phones down to L.A. and instructs a vicious (and viciously bearded) military agent called Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to launch guided missiles at the so-called illegals. Its strange that she hasnt found a way to weaponize her haircut. At least two of the invaders of Delacourts air space -- a Latina and her ill daughter -- wanted access to a bed that heals the sick simply by scanning the body. Its a device even more sophisticated than the more gruesomely depicted versions in Prometheus and The Wolverine. In less than 20 minutes Elysium presents itself as a movie depressed about socioeconomic wrongs that the poor live in City of God and the rich live in a land whose theme music is ""Pachelbels Canon."" How does anyone down there successfully get up there? Blomkamp presents a young laborer named Max Da Costa as a possible bridge. Max was raised by Spanish-speaking nuns one of whom tells him in a childhood flashback ""You will do something important."" (Yes like grow up to look like Matt Damon) His Max is a poor ex-con factory worker accosted and attacked by robocops who target him because perhaps hes the only white guy in sight. He must be guilty of something. Indeed Max cant catch a break unless of course the break is of his arm. In the hospital his boyhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) happens to be both his nurse and a lifelong crush. She accepts a date but before love can happen Max suffers a terrible workplace disaster that leaves him fatally radioactive and suddenly of interest to a band of radical illegals led by Wagner Moura whove been trying to make it to Elysium. The plan to get there -- so Max can hop into one of those health-reversal machines -- requires both surgery for a neurally interfaced exoskeleton and stealing from an Elysium citizen (in this case a powerful CEO played by William Fichtner who happens to also have very important codes that a power-mad Delacourt desperately wants). Blomkamp has overwritten this movie -- Frey has a daughter with leukemia; would Max please please get her to Elysium too? -- but you watch curious about where hell take it and you and these actors. Damon doesnt have far to go. Hes given some tattoos and dangerous backstory but hes playing a saint and as fearless as hes become as an actor this is not a part that asks him to put much on the line. Thats fine but once the movie has offered another flashback or plea for pity on Maxs behalf you know that Blomkamp could have made this movie with just about any actor. He doesnt need a star to propel the material. Damon is as much a hood ornament as Elysium is. Meanwhile Foster attacks her scenes with a kind of menace -- Blomkamp encourages her to use French as a typical demonstration of exclusive refinement and to speak English with a kind of vaguely British hardness. Its as if Blomkamp took the movie away before Foster finished figuring out her performance. At least once her lips are moving in the opposite direction of her dialogue. Is the character malfunctioning or is the actor? The movie also has a thankless part for Diego Luna and Braga a Brazilian who was in City of God seems stuck as the restorative sci-fi love interest -- as she was in I Am Legend and Repo Men. She might be a terrific actress but if this is all Hollywood will let her do -- flinty girlfriend-mothers -- I dont think I can watch. Its Moura whos the best thing in this movie but he does so much barking that at some point what youre really admiring is his vocal stamina. Blomkamps previous film District 9 from four years ago was a more explicit if more obvious science-fiction apartheid allegory (it was set in the South African townships). There the non-whites were literal aliens called ""prawns"" who were bound to shanties and chronically persecuted. Mostly the story (an inspired act of empathy) concerned the mutation of a white bureaucrat played by Copley from person to prawn. In Elysium surgery turns Max into a ghetto-deluxe prawn metallic and full of USB ports. (One character calls him a favela ninja. Im calling him the Toxic Avenger.) Blomkamp at the moment is neither a dramatist nor -- despite whatever it is that Copley is doing in his films -- a natural comedian. He was born in 1973 grew up white in apartheid-era Johannesburg and has opted for moralist action spectacles. Elysium seizes on the more global woe of apartheid but Blomkamp doesnt give any specificity to his sense of injustice. The movie is political without ever risking being mistaken for a polemic. Theres a desert brawl at the films midway point and some climactic combat up on Elysium thats set in the same kind of power plant/science laboratory as a lot of the rest of these movies -- Star Trek Into Darkness and The Wolverine being two recent examples. (So much thought has gone into how Elysium should look that the film seems terrified to touch anything. This place is the production-design equivalent of your grandmothers plastic-encased couch no spills.) Any thematic audacity is snuffed out by action sequences that you can now buy at Dollar General. What also are we to do with the many flashbacks to when Max and Frey were young and with the scenes in which Freys little girl addresses Max with a parable or the audience with her sad-puppy face? Is this a work of empathy or outrage or guilt? Its too vague about too much to know for sure. Blomkamp recently told Entertainment Weekly that he dislikes the science fiction label. This movie is now he said meaning that setting Elysium in 2154 is what? A red herring? A marketing ploy? An excuse to spend a lot of money? Obviously he meant that the film cant be dismissed as mere science fiction. Hes going after the 1 percent. Hes going after government neglect and venality. Apparently hes also going after the Tijuana police who not long ago nabbed Blomkamp on the U.S.-Mexico border and dropped him and a producer in the middle of nowhere. This time alas its personal -- and yet not nearly enough. Blomkamp is also going after other movies ones starring Charlton Heston say. Theres also George Millers Mad Max trilogy John Carpenters Escape From ... films and the museum-ready miserablism of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. If you saw Oblivion from the spring with Tom Cruise and remember it youll know where Elysium wants to tread and youll ask whether a better less biblical solution was available. If Blomkamp is mad as hell thats not what you feel. You feel marketplace concerns. Crazier guns More evil Copley to shoot and be shot at Blomkamp is a talented loosely visionary director but after two movies it appears to be a limited vision. Hes stuck between real rebellion and real marketability. So the new movie is a mess of violence and parental devotional but rarely at the same time. Depending on the audience one is meant to make the other palatable. And Damon is here to make Elysium palatable to everyone. If youre TriStar Pictures some delicacy might be in order. Maybe you dont want your socioeconomic-justice action blockbuster to pit a Braga or Luna or Kerry Washington or Will Smith alone against Planet Country Club. You dont want your first movie out of the gate to look like a race riot. But you cant help but wonder whether some people will see Damon anointed the chosen one while surrounded by indigent affronted capable brown people and think We dont need another hero. People are really laughing at Were the Millers. I told a friend after I saw it a couple nights ago that I didnt find it that funny. ""OMG youre crazy"" she said. ""Different strokes"" she went on praying for my soul. The movie has Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Emma Roberts and Will Poulter as four lowlifes who fake being a family to smuggle drugs from Mexico to the U.S. in an RV. Sudeikiss character needs a bigger dealer (Ed Helms hopefully doing a parody of Ed Helms) to forgive his debt. So he recruits Aniston who has quit her job as a stripper and needs to pay her rent; Roberts who needs to stay out of trouble; and virginal Poulter who wants to get into some. There are several run-ins with a Christian family in an RV headed by Kathryn Hahn and Nick Offerman. One encounter happens inside a tent and culminates with Hahns hands on Anistons breasts. Theres a beat missing in this movie. I wasnt sure what it was and then Aniston and Roberts show Poulter how to kiss in the RV. The scene works because it builds to a punch line that you can see coming but whose arrival you dread. The director Rawson Marshall Thurber keeps an increasingly dazed Poulter oscillating between the younger woman and other older one between the mother and the daughter so long that its funny. The movie thinks it has anarchic spirit but only in that scene is it real. True comedic anarchy for this movie requires the phony family to subvert real family values without winking at us. Aniston and Roberts get so much pleasure out of showing Poulter what to do with his tongue -- not sexual pleasure but the maternal and filial satisfaction of imparting a lesson to a son or a brother. And Poulter who was so good as a tween Brit filmmaker in Son of Rambow has a great American accent and deserves a movie of his own cant process the lessons fast enough. Thurber (Dodgeball A True Underdog Story) tries to make a farce out of a script credited to four writers (Bob Fisher Steve Faber Sean Anders and John Morris) but the comedy comes sporadically. He oversees a good bit with some Mexican stowaways at the border checkpoint but too much of the movie feels compromised. At some point Pretty Woman comes up in relation to Anistons character whos not -- so not she doth protest -- a prostitute and you remember that that movie was once a downer that became a Garry Marshall upper. Were the Millers also feels as if it began as a much darker film and was gradually lightened up by a fear of going too far. Instead the movies lingering close-ups on yearning faces and heart-to-heart conversations force the fake Millers into real familial longing thats more bogus than the family itself. But nobodys laughing at that. Theyre laughing at Aniston doing an Im-still-hot-dammit striptease that is not her finest comedic (or kinetic) moment. Theyre cracking up at the big furry spider that bites Poulter on the nuts and make his eyes go as big as his swollen scrotum. That stuff brings down the house. But I must have been Buster Keaton because the house came down around me. As meek as Elysium and Were the Millers might be neither is the embarrassment of bashfulness that is The Canyons a Los Angeles sex movie directed by Paul Schrader written by Bret Easton Ellis and starring Lindsay Lohan and the prolific adult-movie actor James Deen. No one here risks enough to achieve disaster. Its worse than that. It believes its taking risks it actually has no interest in taking that its seeing profundity in the showbiz shallows. Lohan and Deen are a couple festering with distrust. Hes some kind of movie producer who thinks shes banging the lead (Nolan Gerard Funk) in his upcoming movie because she is. How long until he calls her on it? How long until she concedes? How long until one of the actors does some acting? Lohan languishes and broods and lashes out. As a screen presence she has become a spectacle of ruined glory like the dilapidated movie palaces in the vacuous montage that opens the film. You trust in powers that she has yet to use as though playing Elizabeth Taylor in that terrible TV astonishment has nonetheless imbued her with Taylors stature. This must be what a fool believes since dialogue like ""Im really sorry I havent congratulated you on starting your own PR company"" are scarcely ""Mama face it. I was the slut of all time."" No man who once wrote a novel as lyrical and lacerating as The Rules of Attraction should ever admit to having written this. In some of the lighting and music cues you can feel the movie straining to evoke doom and the ominous atmosphere and erotic saturation of David Lynch whos an obvious point of reference (so for me were Henry Jaglom and Alan Rudolph). If Lynch specializes in movie-minded fun houses and sublimated waste The Canyons is unsalvageable rubbish. Schrader is no dummy though. Hes a brilliant intellectual director who perhaps was looking for the easy hit hes never had. This is all highly watchable but so are fires car crashes and humping dogs. Very few of Schraders artistic ideas about sex and masculinity come through this time only Lohans orchestration of some homoeroticism during a Christmas-lit four-way. Every scene here has the potential to be taken to some higher power the way Lynch used the knowingly terrible first half of Mulholland Drive as a portal to the hallelujahs of the second. There are moments in this film that imply that Schrader is looking for somewhere to hang his artistic hat and the only hook he can find is Deens cock.

How the Other Half Lives In Neill Blomkamps Energetic Blockbuster the 1 Percent Have High-Tailed It to Space | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie How the Other Half Lives In Neill Blomkamps Energetic Blockbuster the 1 Percent Have High-Tailed It to Space No sleep til Elysium By Matthew Kassel  08/06/13 635pm Matt Damon gets ready to kick some ass in Elysium. Earth in Neill Blomkamps new science fiction thriller Elysium set in 2154 is one big wretched slum arid diseased dangerous and overcrowded. There is little hope for its denizens though at least all are equal in their own miserable destitution. Until they look up. Their poverty is thrown into sharp relief by a giant orbital space station visible high in the sky above them like some exotic moon to which the ultra-wealthy have absconded. In this paradisiacal gated community writ large--it resembles an elaborate golf course dotted with mansions palm trees and other gold-plated trappings--the rich live extremely well. Most of Elysium takes place in Los Angeles a filthy hellhole of stacked homes and narrow streets patrolled by robot police. Max (a ripped tattooed Matt Damon) is an ex-car thief who works at a factory. One day at work he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and is told he has five days to live. Unless that is he makes it to Elysium where the rich have developed tanning-bed-like contraptions that will cure any illness. Elysium however is assiduously guarded by the sociopathic defense secretary Delacourt (a cold-blooded Jodie Foster); a voyage into space is a death wish. At this point its worth noting that Elysium is the kind of movie to which Observer film critic Rex Reed would probably award zero stars alongside an incendiary diatribe assailing the systematic dismantling of the intellect of a great democracy. But Mr. Reed is currently at the Toronto International Film Festival so youll have to forgive my charitable assessment of this engaging and socially conscious picture. Elysiums propulsive plot makes it solid summer fare. You dont have to believe that Mr. Blomkamps depiction of a not-too-distant future is accurate to spot the films thinly veiled allegory which feels timely if somewhat heavy-handed in light of the global Occupy movement. But Elysium an action movie through and through never once becomes pedantic or contrived. Its not out to teach you a lesson and in that regard it has much in common with District 9 (2009) Mr. Blomkamps excellent debut feature which indirectly addressed the issue of apartheid in South Africa his homeland. Elysium despite its ambitiousness may be a lesser film than District 9--it doesnt resonate quite as deeply--but its propulsive unflagging plot makes it solid summer fare and better than much of what has been in theaters lately in the blockbuster category. As his organs begin to deteriorate Max goes to a man named Spider (Wagner Moura) a kind of cyber genius who arranges covert trips to Elysium that--like a Cuban rafting to Florida--you are not likely to survive. Spider makes a deal with Max who is told to hijack the valuable brain data of an Elysian citizen (they make business trips to Earth) in exchange for passage to the sky. In order to perform this theft--which will be Maxs magnum opus--a strength-giving exoskeleton is affixed to his body and plugged into his nervous system. How someone who is dying from radiation exposure lives through such complex surgery is the kind of question that Elysium with its invigorating pace successfully elides. Like Max the movie has to keep moving and Mr. Blomkamp lets you fill in the gaps yourself as it progresses. Or not. His film never explains how the world got to be the way it is or how the rich made their way into space. But how much backstory do you really want in your summer action flick? In the course of around 30 minutes Maxs arm is broken his bones are sawed a car blows up while he is inside it and he is stabbed in the stomach by a villain named Kruger (Sharlto Copley the protagonist of District 9) whose mission is to procure the data that Max gets ahold of. Slapstick humor punctuates Elysiums dire mood and an undeveloped (and ultimately dispensable) love story gives some emotional depth to Mr. Damons stolid character. Eventually (and unsurprisingly) Maxs mission becomes much larger than an escapade whose goal is saving only his own life. As happens when a hero wades into world-saving territory the mood gets maudlin. And while the movie may not in the end be so effective in tapping into our current class anxieties that hardly seems to matter. Like a trip to Elysium its a wild ride.

The wealthy accordingly have moved to a better neighborhood a gleaming space station called Elysium an orbital oasis where sleekly coutured ""makers"" have at last escaped contact with grime-encrusted ""takers."" In this ring-shaped Galts Gulch in the sky everything is lushly green or glinting with chrome each dwelling the equivalent of a penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. Back on the home planet by contrast all is dirt-brown and rubble-gray and the masses struggle through days of Morlock drudgery while Elysium gleams down on them like the celestial middle finger of the Eloi Take that takers.Elysium is the second feature by South-African-born director Neill Blomkamp following his 2009 breakthrough District 9. With that earlier film Blomkamp then all of 29 years old offered up a fluid seamless blend of handheld camera-work and CGI effects a kind of sci-fi verite. These striking visuals were enlisted in the service of a pointed political parable about South Africa (and in particular an atrocity committed in 1966) apartheid but with aliens.Related Story Escape From L.A. Today How a 1996 Sci-Fi Thriller Imagined the Year 2013 If District 9 advertised the artistry of which Blomkamp was capable with a relatively paltry 30 million budget Elysium demonstrates what he can do with a Hollywood-sized bankroll. The world on display here is imaginative yet utterly convincing from the battle-dinged security robots to the various transport ships (civilian military luxury) that ferry between Earth and Elysium to the cityscapes of his future Los Angeles a pan-American melting pot of post-urban decay. Elysium itself is a particular marvel a revolving torus open to the ""sky"" on its inner edge such that shuttles can glide directly into its atmosphere to land on the ""surface."" (Somewhere one hopes Ringworld author Larry Niven is nodding appreciatively.)But if Elysium is a testament to Blomkamps extraordinary skill as a visual filmmaker it does not speak nearly so well for his gifts as a writer. The plot revolves around Max DeCosta (Matt Damon) an ex-con who now works in a plant that makes security bots. (Like Doug Quaid in last summers forgettable Total Recall remake hes manufacturing the means of his own oppression.) An industrial accident results in Maxs exposure to a massive dose of radiation and as a result hes given five days to live. Nor is he alone the young daughter of his childhood best friend (Alice Braga) has leukemia and her health too is declining quickly.Luckily for both of them although health care on Earth is scarce and low-tech on Elysium every home has its own medical pod capable of instantly healing virtually any condition--from broken bones to old age to (as we will learn) a face entirely blown off by explosives--by ""re-atomizing"" the patient. Moreover a byproduct of the stations open-air design and near-total absence of defense mechanisms is that Earth refugees frequently commandeer shuttles to make uninvited visits usually in search of medical treatment. These interplanetary illegals are subsequently rounded up and deported but when the alternative is certain death from an illness that can be cured in seconds on Elysium thats a decidedly minor disincentive.So Max makes a deal with a local crime lord He will kidnap a captain of industry (William Fichtner) in order to download information held in his brain and in return hell get a ticket on the next illicit flight to Elysium. To help with the gig Max even has a powerful exo-skeleton grafted painfully onto his body. The intended kidnappee however turns out to be a pawn in a substantially larger scheme and Max soon finds himself on the wrong side of Elysiums ambitious Secretary of Defense (Jodie Foster affecting an almost unidentifiable--maybe South African?--accent) and the brutal mercenary she employs on the ground (Sharlto Copley the star of District 9 here much louder and more ill-tempered). Without going into details very little of what follows--a plot to steal the Elysium presidency that makes the most extreme Diebold conspiracy theories seem tame a computer virus more game-changing than any since Independence Day--makes even rudimentary sense.As Blomkamps issue horizon has expanded from apartheid to immigration health-care access and the general divide between haves and have-nots his narrative focus seems to have gotten hazier.There were shortcuts and plot lapses in District 9 as well--why for instance did the fuel that powered alien spaceships double as a biogenetic substance that turned human beings into aliens?--but in Elysium the head-scratchers pile up far more quickly. Blomkamp is a holder of strong political convictions (in interviews he has said of his film ""This isnt science fiction. This is today. This is now."") and as his issue horizon has expanded from apartheid to immigration health-care access and the general divide between haves and have-nots his narrative focus seems to have gotten hazier.Theres still much to recommend Elysium. Damon gives a characteristically appealing performance. Blomkamp generously spares us the kind of tedious exposition--how Elysium works why its atmosphere doesnt float away etc.--that so often clogs up science-fiction fare. And the visuals are terrific enough to merit the price of a ticket all on their own. For a while they enable Blomkamp to create a world so physically persuasive as to keep disbelief suspended. But eventually the accumulation of illogic is too heavy and Elysium crashes back to Earth.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter.

She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

In District 9 he reimagined apartheid with a cast of giant shrimp from outer space and Elysium has a similarly angry politically progressive satirical premise. Its the year 2154 and the planet has been polluted to the point where the rich have decamped for a humongous super-space-station in orbit -- a paradise of manicured lawns swimming pools robot servants and machines that cure cancer in like fifteen seconds. Its called Elysium and down below the poor in their dirty slums -- overseen by robots and compassionless bureaucrats -- gaze on the ring-shaped structure like the brass ring on an old merry-go-round. But that ring is hard if not impossible to grab. Elysiums defense secretary welcomes illegal immigrants with guided missiles. The movie hits its marks; its a more than decent formula sci-fi action picture with one or two nicely gruesome effects. But it doesnt have that witty handmade look that made District 9 seem so much lighter than most of Hollywoods lumbering efforts. A surprisingly dour Matt Damon plays Max an ex-thief turned luckless parolee who once had big dreams but has finally been beaten down. He wants only to keep his dangerous factory job stay out of trouble and maybe one day earn enough to buy a one-way ticket to Elysium. The problem is that he has a way of mouthing off to authority figures especially the cheap-looking robotic parole officer dummy that wont let him speak. Their exchange -- which comes early -- is probably the movies highlight. The machine has been programmed to detect sarcasm or abuse which means Max cant even mutter darkly without risking punishment. The ruling class would be fine with removing his brain soiling his lungs and letting him die before his time. Hes just livestock. With more satire Elysium might sparkle but Blomkamp uses his ever-timely conceit and jittery hand-held camera in the service of the dumbest kind of melodrama. Jodie Foster plays the defense secretary who orders spaceships bearing illegal-immigrant families destroyed in defiance of a president who tells her just to send them back to Earth. (He doesnt want to bother his constituents beautiful minds with something as ugly as bodies raining down on their swimming pools.) So she plots to take the president out by prevailing on a robotics mogul (William Fichtner) to reboot the orbiting space station after which she will seize power. I dont understand her dastardly plan either but then nothing about Fosters performance makes sense. Her accent is either English South African or Martian -- its hard to tell since its different in every scene -- and she moves more stiffly than the robots. With Elysium Foster joins the ranks of outspoken liberals (hello Tim Robbins) who cant manage to play their political opposites without turning themselves into caricatures. Damon is much better but he never convinced me he was just out for number one. Hes too much of a sweetie. After Max gets a lethal dose of radiation in a factory hes robotically enhanced by a resourceful smuggler and dispatched on a dangerous mission to upload someones brain. (Im leaving out some interstitial material.) He has one motivation not to die. Purging the effects of radiation takes precedence over everything including helping the adorably inquisitive cancer-ridden daughter of his childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga). But this is not the kind of movie where an A-list star lets a little kid die of cancer. Its just not. You can see Maxs moral trajectory from miles away. And how can the climax not be Max versus the paramilitary psycho goon (similarly robotically enhanced) played by the star of District 9 Sharlto Copley? You cant spoil a movie that telegraphs nearly every turn. It spoils itself. The action is bludgeoning. When Max gets pummeled by fists and lethal objects we get pummeled by light and noise and rock-em-sock-em editing. No shrimp though. As a narrative District 9 wasnt particularly original either -- in the end it was a standard conversion melodrama. But everything is better with shrimp.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 08 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Aug. 07 2013 519PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Neill Blomkamp Written by Neill Blomkamp Starring Matt Damon Jodie Foster Classification 14A Genre scifi Country USA Language English In the past year three big-budget science-fiction films have tried to visualize international economic disparity via topsy-turvy imagery. The Canada-France co-production Upside Down imagined a prosperous planet hovering implacably over another impoverished one; Tom Cruises iPod-sleek vanity project Oblivion was set in a post-apocalyptic realm where the haves literally towered over the have-nots. Now theres Neill Blomkamps Elysium which finds a ruling class of one-percenters orbiting a hellishly overpopulated future Earth. The hype says its the best of the bunch but its really just mediocre - a cautionary tale about the dangers of squandering resources that wastes its own talent. For instance there may not be a better action-star actor right now than Matt Damon who specializes in playing Everyman types surrounded by sinister conspiracies. As Max a rough-and-tumble assembly-line worker who literally produces the tools of his masters oppression - he builds the riot-control droids used to keep the planets swelling population in line - Damon displays a gritty wit but Blomkamp impatiently shifts him into the role of a humourless martyr. After suffering a fatal dose of radiation poisoning on the job Max is hired by a group of revolutionaries to infiltrate the satellite-society of Elysium which resembles a Californian suburb nestled inside one of the waltzing spaceships from 2001 A Space Odyssey.Blomkamp whose previous film was the dubious South African parable District 9 (which crudely substituted intergalactic squid-men for indigenous blacks) is clearly trying to say something here about capitalism and its discontents. The inhabitants of Elysium are to a man callous and oblivious high-rollers. And to a woman too Jodie Foster is on hand as the floating communitys bloodthirsty secretary of defence who methodically mows down shuttles carrying refugees. And like most totalitarian movie villains she has a pet monster to do her really dirty work for her the bearded mercenary Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who has lived amongst the unwashed masses for so long that hes started to harbour a grudge against his bosses.In order to breach Elysiums defences Max is outfitted with an unbreakable metal exoskeleton (which would seem to make him too conspicuous for undercover work but whatever). Hes literally a class warrior although Blomkamp is less interested in the complicated particulars of proletarian uprising than showing people shooting at each other with gigantic guns. Like District 9 Elysium is most impressive as an audition reel for a director whose dream is clearly to adapt the popular shoot-em-up videogame Halo into a feature film. The scenes of carnage are the only thing that this director does remotely well. Elsewhere laughably lyrical flashbacks to Maxs childhood and some Saturday-morning-cartoon-level dialogue pertaining to the Foster characters attempted coup detat indicate his glaring tone-deafness as a dramatist. Deafness is also a byproduct of the films assaultive sound design which keeps hammering Ryan Amons Dark Knight-biting musical score into our ears possibly in an attempt to damage the sort of higher brain functions that would compel viewers to poke holes in Elysiums narrative inconsistencies and logical fallacies.One of Blomkamps most unlikely conceits is a machine - apparently standard-issue in all of Elysiums made-to-order McMansions - that can heal all injuries and infections at the flick of a switch. He could have used one to fix Elysiums battered and broken screenplay.

When the working poor scramble even for dead-end jobs. When the very best health care is only for the absurdly rich. Go ahead. Imagine. Try real hard. Thats the picture pointed by the summers latest dystopian sci-fi film ""Elysium"" and yes although its set more than 100 years in the future its a portrait that could pass for a photograph. Its the way we live now -- only made even worse. But the saddest thing is that not only has our Earth barely survived but subtlety and clarity seem to have taken a beating too. The film from Neill Blomkamp stars Matt Damon as Max an ex-con factory worker who gets an incurable case of radiation sickness. Hes determined to survive though -- and knows he can if he can just get to the space station where all the one-percenters now live and where cures comes at the push of a button. Except -- how to get there? Well theres a smuggler who can get him offland -- but the smuggler demands a very high price. One that involves Max briefly returning to his life of crime and stealing government files. The only trick is that first he has to have a port implanted in his brain for the download. And then Max has to not only get the files but get away. This is the movie Matt Damon shaved his head for awhile back if you were wondering and hes fine as our grimy hero. Less successful are Jodie Foster as a fascistic government official -- wound so tight she looks like she could crack walnuts between her knees -- and Wagner Moura overacting wildly as Spider the criminal kingpin. Damon is solid though and the movies design continues the sort of distressed-tech look that George Lucas and James Cameron pioneered -- rocketships that seem held together with wire colossal machines that leak grease and shed bolts with every shuddering spasm. As does sometimes the movies awkward story. The film is Neill Blomkamps followup to ""District 9"" his lively sci-fi parable of apartheid and the South African director continues his attacks here on government cruelties immigration policies economic inequalities second-tier citizenship and white racism. But its all done so obviously so transparently -- including plenty of references to ""homeland security"" and an Afrikaner villain named Kruger -- that it comes across as more speech than script. Its like one of those bad ""Star Trek"" episodes when Gene Roddenberry stopped everything on the bridge so he could lecture us about the Cold War. Nor is the plotting particularly adept. I never understood why in this advanced society people needed to upload data directly into their brains. (Is a zip drive really that inconvenient?) Nor did I ever believe that simply changing a computer code could truly force a coup or instantly create a bloodless revolution. Theyre nice ideas on paper but they dont really make much sense when you think about them. Nor perhaps does ""Elysium"" which uses those pacifist ideas chiefly as an excuse for Damon to put on exo-skeleton armor and run around firing enormous weapons. As far as dystopian movies go - and this year has seen a lot of them -- this is far more fun than ""After Earth"" or ""Oblivion"" and probably better acted than ""Pacific Rim."" But it still feels a little like a sermon wrapped in a story -- and delivered by laser-blaster. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Elysium (PG-13) TriStar (109 min.) Directed by Neill Blomkamp. With Matt Damon Jodie Foster Alice Braga.

Richardsaid on Saturday August 17 2013 65804 PMPlease warn us in advance when films have jiggling cameras. I had to walk out of Elysium due to distressing camera jiggles in close-ups. Adamsaid on Thursday August 15 2013 52629 PMEntertaining movie as RR notes. I could not help but notice more than a couple straight ripoffs from the 1993 anime Battle Angel (i.e. the plot involving Zalem the Factory a main antagonist having a double-bladed sword etc.) that itself is being rebooted in 2017 by James Cameron. I guess a compelling story deserves more than one go-at. Carlsaid on Saturday August 10 2013 54753 PMI m a huge fan of District 9 and I found that Elysium was without question a MIRROR-movie of District 9... Let me explain may contain spoilers Both main characters are contaminated early in the film. As we progress in the movie both of them go through extensive body modifications. Then both of them are being hunted down by the government/corporations for something they have INSIDE THEM that nobody else has. Both characters only motivation is to initially CURE themselves. Then both characters become involved with someone and their offspring so the motivation is no longer only to cure themselves but to save that person and their offspring.Then BOTH of them wind up on an operating table about to undergo a surgical procedure that will kill them (and in both movies the person about to perform the procedure warns his superior that it will kill the patient but the superior says its ok). Then both of them escape the operating table in almost identical ways. Afterwards when they are trying to escape they both stumble upon futuristic weapons that blow stuff up which they use as best they can against the enemy. And finally the main villain in both movies is a military thug who hunts them down for the government/corporations. Dont get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie the action sequences were amazing... but to me it is just a re-theming of District 9... D9 being the better original...

"Review Despite Matt Damon Elysium disappoints - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Despite Matt Damon Elysium disappoints Elysium Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Elysium starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Elysium starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Despite its title ""Elysium"" is no promised land.Expectations were high that the film starring Matt Damon would carry the flag for thoughtful big-budget films that care about more than profits. But it has ended up as something of a disappointment an epic that has gone over to the dark side without realizing it. That anticipation came courtesy of ""District 9"" -- the 2009 science fiction film by Neill Blomkamp ""Elysiums"" South African writer-director -- which came out of nowhere to be nominated for four Oscars including best picture and adapted screenplay.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments ""District 9"" succeeded in part because of the strength of its unexpected core idea that aliens coming to Earth were not necessarily a dominant species but instead were rounded up and segregated in their own parts of town the way blacks had been in South Africa.""Elysium"" makes a similar attempt to graft socio-political concerns onto a sci-fi framework but the idea is less electric here and the combining of genre and theme not as adroitly done.Initially however things do seem promising in ""Elysium"" in large part because of how its subject matter is compellingly visualized on screen (Philip Ivey is the production designer).PHOTOS Celebrities by The Times The year is 2154 and Earth thanks to the destructive effects of pollution overpopulation and related ills is in horrific shape. Blighted devastated slums cover the planet and they are home to the poorest people (a Mexico City garbage dump stands in for Los Angeles).Anyone of wealth and status now lives on Elysium a circular space station whose shape is reminiscent of the much smaller one in Stanley Kubricks ""2001."" The air is pure robots do the work and everywhere there are healing machines that cure what ails you. Think of a flesh-and-blood version of the disparities in Disneys ""Wall-E"" and youll get the general idea.Making the best of things on the planet is Max played by a bulked-up head-shaved tattooed Damon. Max is a former car thief once a legend in his Los Angeles neighborhood who is working on a factory assembly line hoping to better his lot and maybe even get to Elysium someday.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Clearly social inequality is very much on Blomkamps mind and when you add in illegal clandestine space flights from Earth to Elysium by people desperate for medical attention its clear that hot-button issues like illegal immigration and universal access to healthcare are on the table as well.This is all well and good but paradoxically once the actual plot of ""Elysium"" kicks in these issues fade from the films consciousness and the traditional less involving tropes of good-guy-versus-bad-guy action take center stage. Although the pulp energy that Blomkamp brings to this material makes it consistently watchable the film doesnt feel as singular as we would have hoped.Max given a hard time by the humorless droids who police Earth has to go to the local hospital where he gets reacquainted with nurse Frey (Alice Braga) his childhood soul mate from no kidding the orphanage where they both grew up.Back at the plant where Max works things get worse. Our hero is put in a dangerous situation and ends up with a lethal dose of radiation that will kill him in five days. His only hope is to somehow get to Elysium and make use of one of those miraculous cure-all machines.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubNot averse to helping Max are his neighborhood pal Julio (Mexicos Diego Luna) and Spider (Brazils Wagner Moura) who runs illegal shuttles to Elysium. But the price is steep Max fortified by an exoskeleton that gives him added strength will have to capture one of Elysiums top dogs evil plutocrat John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and download information from the mans brain a situation riskier than anyone imagines. And more pedestrian.For one thing the villains in ""Elysium"" are very conventional. Aside from Carlyle Jodie Foster -- displaying excellent French and a stern visage -- is one-dimensional as the Armani-clad Dragon Lady villainess determined to protect Elysium no matter the cost. Kruger her thuggish enforcer (""District 9"" star Sharlto Copley) is even more of a cliche.Countering all this is Damon who is a big plus as always instinctively humanizing thankless roles like Max and making them look easy. But once Max faces off with Kruger and his gang as they inevitably must all thoughts of anything besides hand-to-hand combat fade into insignificance. The plot gets unnecessarily confusing and violent images including a particularly grotesque blown-away face push everything else away. ""Elysium"" may think it is about issues but at times like these thats very hard to see.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ElysiumMPAA Rating R for strong bloody violence and language throughoutRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesIn general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Elysium (movie) Movies Entertainment Matt Damon District 9 (movie) Mexico On the Set Movies and TV Review Despite Matt Damon Elysium disappoints Review Lovelace reveals degradation of porn stars life Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-elysium-movie-review-20130809,0,4043496.story",200,elysium10,elysium,latimes

"Elysium starring Matt Damon reviewed with optional spoilers. Slate Sign In Sign Up Elysium Is a Waste of a Perfectly Good Dystopia Elysium Is a Waste of a Perfectly Good Dystopia Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 8 2013 704 PM Elysium A waste of a perfectly good dystopia. By Dana Stevens Matt Damon is just a grunting lug in the intelligence-insulting Elysium. Photo courtesy Kimberley French/Columbia TriStar Neill Blomkamps first film District 9 did a lot with a little turning a sci-fi story about segregated space aliens into a vivid (if overlong) pop parable about South African apartheid. His second one Elysium--a sci-fi thriller on a much larger scale complete with Hollywood stars and state-of-the-art CGI effects--does a little sometimes shockingly little with a lot. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Like District 9 Elysium takes on contemporary problems of economic and social injustice--this time not racial prejudice but the vast worldwide gulf between haves and have-nots. But after taking some pains to imagine and present a mid-22nd-century world thats a plausibly grim extrapolation of the one we live in Blomkamp proceeds to spend the last two-thirds of his film crashing spaceships into lawns or staging high-tech fistfights between Elysiums stolid hero and his even duller arch-nemesis. Its a waste of a perfectly good dystopia. In 2154 Blomkamps script posits Earth will have become a kind of vast slum where youre stuck scrabbling for a hand-to-mouth existence if you dont have the means and the connections to move to Elysium. This paradisiacal off-world colony is housed in an elegant wheel-shaped structure thats visible from Earth taunting our planets struggling masses with its unattainable proximity. Elysiums atmosphere--and confusingly its political system as well--seem to be maintained by a vast computer network that surveys and controls everything that happens in the colony. Elysians live in a luxury unimaginable to earthlings their every need attended to by robot servants; their sleek modern houses look like something out of a 90s perfume commercial. Though theres a puppet president (Faran Tahir) the true power in Elysium belongs to the steely secretary of defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) who enforces a brutal anti-immigration policy No unauthorized earthlings can be permitted to breach the colonys atmosphere not even to make emergency use of the miraculous medical bays that are an Elysian household appliance. (Face destroyed in a grenade attack? Just hop into this magic glass tube and youre good as new.) Advertisement Back home on earth there are some serious medical emergencies in need of magic-tube treatment. Max (Matt Damon) a factory laborer whos one of the rare Anglos living in a predominantly Hispanic Los Angeles has received a fatal dose of radiation in an industrial accident and has only five days to live. His childhood best friend Frey (Alice Braga) now a nurse is the single mother of a little girl (Emma Tremblay) with terminal leukemia. Max bribes a friend in the criminal underworld Spider (Wagner Moura) to secure them passage to Elysium and after an inordinately long series of battles in and around various space vehicles they make it there--only to find themselves the subject of a manhunt ordered by the icy Ms. Delacourt and principally conducted by her henchman the mentally unbalanced renegade Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Elysium has some very basic structural and story problems The last half is essentially one barely interrupted chase leaving no breathing time for either the characters or audience and the incoherent absurdly simplistic ending--which I should probably discuss in a second location so as not to spoil--would be an insult to the intelligence of an audience of llamas. But all these flaws might have been forgiven if the first half of the movie had loaded up the audience with enough goodwill to last us through the long slog of action sequences to come. Instead Elysium seems from the outset in a hurry to get past who the characters are and on to what they represent. Max and Frey are a dull-as-dirt leading couple a grunting lug and an angelic do-gooder whose only connection is established in short sentimental flashbacks to two children running in slow motion. Fosters supercilious empathy-free defense minister is the most memorable character in the movie (if only because of her supremely indeterminate accent) but the focus shifts too early from Delacourt to the far less interesting villain played by Sharlto Copley. Copley a distinctive South African actor who was arresting in the complex lead role of District 9 doesnt get to do much more than snarl menacingly as he runs down corridors. Most disappointing of all though is that cop-out of an ending which makes a chump of any viewer who was trying to take this movies claims to sociopolitical relevance seriously. If righting complex historically rooted geopolitical (hell cosmopolitical) injustices were as easy as the last 15 minutes of Elysium suggests wed never have needed to build that off-world colony in the first place.

Slideshow Elysium - the rich above the slums below Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Elysium >> In Elysium Blomkamps rabble-rousing sci-fi allegory Earth is a wasteland. Its the mid-22d century and the whole world is the Third World shantytown sprawl; high-rise ruins; a planet that is were told ""diseased polluted and vastly overpopulated."" Its as if the squalid precincts of Johannesburg depicted in the South African filmmakers 2009 debut District 9 had spread everywhere. Blomkamp handed a bigger budget and a big movie star to go with it - Matt Damon shaven-headed and angry - paints a canvas of epic decay. Among the slew of recent futuristic hell-in-a-handbasket spectacles Elysium takes the cake. And while the teeming and miserable masses eke it out on terra firma orbiting up there in the sky is the giant gleaming hubcap known as Elysium where the elite live in elegant McMansions swim in endless-horizon pools partake of gourmet feasts and of course speak French. This is the ultimate gated community Wealthy expats from Earth stroll their sumptuous grounds and strike their supermodel poses and if a shuttle ship crammed with illegals breaches the perimeter Secretary of Defense Delacourt (a suitably officious Jodie Foster) orders it blasted beyond whats left of the ozone layer. And if by chance a band of dirty immigrants makes it onto Elysiums surface deportation is immediate. An army of droids makes sure of that. Theres nothing subtle about Blomkamps message in Elysium which finds our hero Damons Max outfitted with an ""exo-suit"" that turns him into the combat equal of the droids. Hes got a hard drive screwed to the back of his skull and hes got five days to make it from Earth to Elysium. Thanks to a mishap at work - hes on the assembly line at a droid plant and hes been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation - thats all the time he has. Unless that is he can get himself onto one of those Elysium medical bays They look like tanning pods and can re-atomize your body curing you of cancer warts and bad breath. No one is sick on Elysium. There are plot complications Frey (Alice Braga) a hospital nurse Max has known since they were children has a child of her own a daughter with leukemia. And Secretary Delacourt has Kruger (Sharlto Copley District 9s Afrikaner eviction officer) a madman enforcer with a posse of mercenaries chasing Max down. Delacourt has a plan too in cahoots with snooty industrialist John Carlyle (William Fichtner) to usurp the presidency. A program that would reboot Elysiums computer systems - a coup detat in cybercode - is the movies MacGuffin. Thumping and thrilling Elysium takes its Haves vs. Have Nots parable seriously. Theres not much in the way of comic diversion here although Blomkamp pokes fun at the weary indifference of government bureaucrats by turning them into funhouse automatons - literally. Yes the inevitable climactic square off between Max and Kruger slips into the Hollywood generic - havent we just seen all this head-bashing hanging-from-catwalks mixed-martial-arts mayhem in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3? But as summer movie sci-fi extravaganzas go Elysium is easily the best thing out there right now. And the bleakest too. Elysium  (Out of four stars) Directed by Neill Blomkamp.

By the third act Im sorry to report you can feel the studio dollars directing the film and the whole thing degenerates into the utterly generic chase-and-shoot conclusion that audiences are believed to want. (Maybe they do want it who am I to say? Critics are almost by definition specialists who crave the original and unusual while paying moviegoers tend to prefer variations on a familiar theme.) But even with that major caveat ""Elysium"" is a highlight of the summer and makes clear that Blomkamp is a genuine visionary whos trying to push the envelope of possibility in mainstream popcorn cinema.Like Blomkamps explosive debut ""District 9"" which staged a caste conflict between humans and aliens in the filmmakers racially divided hometown of Johannesburg ""Elysium"" barely pretends to be about the future rather than the present. Its the middle of the 22nd century and Matt Damons character Max is a white kid whos grown up in the Spanish-speaking barrio of Los Angeles - and more important on a poisoned sickly and impoverished planet where slum conditions are general. The wilderness and wildlife we claim to cherish today are long gone and while much of the human population has apparently died off those who remain are something like a permanent helot underclass. Max is lucky enough to have a job risking radiation exposure every day in a factory that assembles the police robots that brutally enforce law and order under a thin veneer of official politeness. Thats a particularly nice touch in Blomkamps screenplay Even the technocratic bureaucratic and completely alienated state apparatus of this dystopian society still pretends to care about the individual.And then theres Elysium a gated community in the sky where the affluent 1 percent (or even less than that) have retreated. Its a beautiful landscaped suburb partly gracious American country living and partly south of France enclosed on a big torus-shaped satellite with artificial gravity. If Elysium carries the geographical separation of rich and poor thats so much a part of our world to new heights it also has a near-metaphysical significance Elysium is a man-made simulacrum of the paradise promised by religion in which no one ever dies or grows old thanks to medical technology that can heal any disease or injury. That technology is not available needless to say in the overcrowded L.A. hospital where Maxs childhood girlfriend Frey (Alice Braga) works and coyotes who promise to smuggle sick or dying earthlings to Elysium for clandestine treatment do a booming business. I would half-seriously suggest in fact that you can read ""Elysium"" as a retelling of Miltons ""Paradise Lost"" with Damon in the heroic role of Satan -- but lets leave that one for the grad students.Under the command of elegant French-speaking military commander Delacourt (Jodie Foster doing her highly convincing upper-crust thing) Elysium defends itself vigorously against incursions by undocumented migrants. Most of the rattletrap spacecraft sent up by Spider an L.A. crime lord played by Brazilian star Wagner Moura are shot down en route killing all the men women and children on board. Elysiums civilian president (Faran Tahir) doesnt approve of Delacourts brutal tactics either because hes troubled on a human level or simply because its bad P.R. So Delacourt aided by a double-dealing robot-arms manufacturer named Carlyle (William Fichtner quite possibly my favorite living American actor his deadpan comic-evil delivery peerless as usual) plots to seize the reins of power for herself. Thats about when Max a longtime criminal whos been trying to go straight and win back Frey takes a lethal dose of radiation in Carlyles factory. He has five days to find his way to Elysium or die. You Might Also Like Thats a heck of a lot of plot to get in the way of the story as my mentor Joe Bob Briggs used to put it in the 80s. Furthermore if you think that setup sounds generally similar to any number of other dystopian sci-fi movies from the ""Logans Run"" and ""Soylent Green"" era on up through ""Robocop"" and both versions of ""Total Recall"" (not to mention Ari Folmans unreleased ""The Congress"" which I saw at Cannes this year) youd be right. But as with ""District 9"" the genius of Blomkamps filmmaking lies in the details from the dusty desperate shantytown feeling of life on Earth to the attempt to pretend that a worldwide failed state is still functioning. Maxs visit to the parole office is like a trip to a big-city DMV with the same numbered tickets light-up displays and multiple-hour waits and his probation officer turns out to be a graffiti-scrawled robot visage with chipped paint and a disturbing resemblance to Bobs Big Boy. It can understand tone of voice eventually ""Are you being sarcastic?"" it asks him and then ""Would you like to speak to a human?"" No he would not.Maxs plan is to kidnap Carlyle download the valuable information loaded in his brain and swap that info to Spider for a gypsy-cab ride to Elysium. Neither of them knows that Carlyles noggin holds the code for an entire ""reboot"" of Elysium that would transform Fosters icy Homeland Security spook into its supreme leader -- and make conditions on Earth even worse. Yeah were talking MacGuffin and from this point forward ""Elysium"" gets a lot less specific and a lot less interesting. Delacourt calls in her ruthless special-ops agent Kruger (South African actor Sharlto Copley Blomkamps longtime pal and collaborator) and he and Max - outfitted with cyborg-like metal exoskeletons - spend the rest of the movie whomping each other like battle-bots and blowing stuff up with high-powered weapons. Actually the action sequences in ""Elysium"" are well choreographed and fun to watch; if they go on too long for my taste were not talking about anything like the degree of overkill found in the endless weightless locomotive-pitching scenes of ""Man of Steel."" Theres masterful cinematography throughout by Trent Opaloch and Philip Iveys production design may be the best work found in any big-budget fantasy this summer. Blomkamp even throws in a ""Matrix""-like plot twist (or two) at the end that may take you by surprise. If ""Elysium"" isnt the post-millennial sci-fi masterpiece I was hoping for it has tremendous resonance and is pretty doggone good for its category. It further underscores the fact that Blomkamp is an immensely talented pop auteur with ambitious populist-democratic politics who wants to make movies for the masses that push just beyond the self-congratulatory comfort zone of Hollywood.

Grade B- Neill Blomkamps ""Elysium"" is a ""Dirty Jobs"" dystopia. That makes it more novel than 99 percent of its summer-blockbuster competitors. Its a what-if movie that asks ""What if the upper crust were really up - way up in the air?"" The idea is more fetching than its execution. The movies blue-collar aesthetic impressive in its vision and kinetics lacks emotional variety and humor. Although Matt Damon gives a heroic performance as the epitome and champion of the proletariat its hard to crack a smile with gritted teeth. But the film stays with you. It gives you an immersive experience thats hard to shake. This movies strengths and fascinations are the obsessive ways it literalizes the gulf between Haves and Have-nots. In its view of Los Angeles in 2154 the streets are like Third World war zones. Hovering overhead in the wild blue yonder is the wealthy satellite haven ""Elysium."" From below it looks like a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament outlined by skywriters and from above it looks like a satellite view of Beverly Hills stretched along the inside of a bike wheel. You cant get from one place to the other if you dont have the exorbitant price of a ticket. Matt Damon plays Max Da Costa a legendary thief turned factory worker. Hes fantasized about buying passage for himself and his childhood girlfriend Frey (Alice Braga) ever since they bonded in a Spanish-speaking orphanage. The foreign language we most often hear in Elysium is naturally French. As Johnny Depps Tonto said ""There comes a time when a good man must wear a mask"" - or in the case of Damon an exoskeleton. When Damon gets radioactively contaminated in a workplace accident even Frey whos become a doctor cant save him. Heck she cant even save her own daughter whos dying of leukemia. Their only hope for salvation is one of the dandy medical healing pods that are de riguer in Elysium homes condos and apartments. To get there Max must team up with his old partner in grand larceny Spider (Wagner Moura) who specializes in selling tickets for renegade shuttles that almost always get shot down. He fits Max with a ""third-generation exoskeleton"" as well as a brain implant. The latter is designed to drain the data out of the head of an evil corporate honcho (William Fichtner) who not only supplies Elysium with the hardware and programs that make it run but has also conspired with the satellites ruthless defense secretary (Jodie Foster) to stage a digital coup. The thematic lines are drawn - all the upper crust figures fascist and liberal alike prove to be deplorable whether they commit crimes against humanity or fail to punish them or simply look the other way. The scene is set for a clash of futuristic titans all right. Sadly what we ultimately get is yet another bout of extreme fighting staged with men so heavily armed and armored they might as well be cyborgs -- not just Max but a black-ops teams led by a ruthless warrior named Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who at one point gives new meaning to the phrase ""swallowing a grenade."" Blomkamp does his cleverest writing and directing near the start when he depicts a day in the life of a drone like Max. His neighbors try to hit him up for money; his former friends kid him about going straight. When some security robocops check his shoulder bag before he boards a bus he jokes about carrying hair products - he figures theyll notice that hes bald. But these mechanical men are like entry-level working-stiff robots. Theyre strong but not dexterous or bright and they fracture his arm and cause his term of parole to be extended. The parole office by the way is the 22nd centurys equivalent of a motor-vehicle department. People wait hours to get to the end of a line where they face robot bureaucrats. You can tell youre in the hands of a real filmmaker. Each futuristic device has an original edge. Some dazzling robot warriors combine a clomping gait with a surprising springiness - like police who seem lumbering in a doughnut shop but display amazing agility when they leap into action at the sound of a gunshot. Blomkamps wit expresses itself mostly in the films structure and design like the contrast between high-tech big-money multiculturalism on Elysium which has a president named Patel and the scrappy multiculturalism of Hispanic and Far East immigrants back on Earth. When Max re-teams with Spider and a friend named Julio (the instantly likable Diego Luna) for a minute you hope the film will turn into ""Fast amp; Furious 140."" Alas the vibe of a band-of-underclass-brothers never quite kicks in. Damon pushes the movie to the finish line almost by himself. The film benefits from the audiences identification with him as an Everyman superhero and fighting liberal. His anti-histrionic intensity lets him play corny moments close to the vest. Blomkamp fills the final scene with soppy flashbacks to Max and Frey as kids but Damon manages to dignify the ending. The world is on his shoulders and he carries the weight well.

"Elysium elevated by buff Matt Damon review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesElysium elevated by buff Matt Damon reviewThis excursion by District 9s Neill Blomkamp runs out of steam when the usual explosive heroics kick in.Matt Damon is something of a one-man army in Elysium.  (Kimberley French / Sony)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 8 2013ElysiumStarring Matt Damon Jodie Foster Alice Braga Sharlto Copley Wagner Moura and William Fichtner. Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp. 109 minutes. Opens Aug. 9 at major theatres. 14AThe hovering paradise that gives Neill BlomkampsElysium its Greek-myth title appears tantalizingly close to diminished Earthlings yet its available only to the pampered elite.Its a tough thing to contemplate for blue-collar guys like Max (a buff and bald Matt Damon) one of many downtrodden denizens of the Los Angeles of 2154 a place much like the rest of the planet where human neglect and environmental disaster have reduced great cities to squalor.Article Continued BelowWhy do the residents of the Elysium space station get abundant food clean water and a magical machine that cures all ills (hooray for socialized health care) while grounded Earthlings suffer?Thats just the way it is Max. Maybe you shouldnt have voted Republican.And for those of us in the comfort of an air-conditioned theatre watching this pretty good sci-fi thriller its not an unfamiliar construct especially if you follow Blomkamp.The South African writer/director knows how to make the most of an opportunity and an influence. Hes been tilling similar apartheid soil since his 2006 short film debut Alive in Joburg in which he depicted his hometown Johannesburg as a place where humans and tentacled-faced squatter aliens nervously coexist as giant decrepit saucers hover overhead.That led to the feature-length (and Oscar-nominated) 2009 remake District 9 and now Elysium opening late Thursday in some Toronto theatres and expanding Friday. The new film takes many of the usual Blomkampian brainstorms (and employs his actor pal Sharlto Copley for a third time) and blows them up to summer blockbuster size. Also intact are Blomkamps cinematic and literary touchstones dystopic fantasies from the likes of Stanley Kubrick George Orwell Fritz Lang Paul Verhoeven Fernando Meirelles and Ridley Scott.The rich/poor divide remains (with filthy humans subbing for creepy aliens) and so do the obvious political connections which now seem more American than South African. Those greedy fascistic Elysium residents who have their own version of Homeland Security to protect themselves and their lifestyles obviously dont support Obamacare (or Ontarios OHIP).They have a ruthless Secretary of Defense named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) to keep out carpetbaggers who attempt to breach Elysiums lethal shield.Its the elevated health care that motivates desperate Earthlings to risk their lives on illicit Elysium excursions which are offered by grubby entrepreneurs like Spider (Wagner Moura) who sells faint hope for big cash.Spiders services are urgently required by Max following an industrial accident at work which has rendered him dangerously radioactive and coffin-bound in five days.Max wont accept his fate -- a wistful prologue has a caring nun telling his younger self ""I know you are special"" -- so he agrees to an offer he cant refuse from Spider who dangles an Elysium cure-all as a carrot.To get it Max must don a exoskeleton fighting suit (yet another Blomkamp trope) welded onto his body that will allow him to hijack an Elysium-connected billionaire (William Fichtner) and to extract his corporate secrets -- which will prove to be of paramount importance to both worlds.But to succeed Max will have to get past not only the billionaires guards but also dangerously rogue Elysium agent Kruger (Copley) who is employed by Delacourt but most assuredly is not controlled by her. Additional urgency and potential romance comes in the person of comely nurse Frey (Alice Braga) a childhood friend of Maxs who also requires a trip to Elysium. (Braga starred in City of God the Fernando Meirelles film about violent Brazilian favela slums that are likely Blomkamps model for his future L.A.)Damons presence greatly alleviates the been-there feel of this Elysium excursion which starts to run out of steam when the usual explosive heroics kick in. He establishes rooting interest for a character whom you may not want to meet on a dark street at night but whom youd want on your side in any physical conflict on or off Earth.Fosters Delacourt also commands the screen what little she gets of it with a commanding portrayal of a genuinely nasty woman who would sooner blow you away than blow you a kiss. If she had a mustache shed twirl it.Too bad the sparring matches involve more of Maxs muscle and Krugers anachronistic blade than of anything more cerebral that Delacourt might have offered.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A dying man from the giant slum called Earth attempts to reach a space station reserved for the rich. Rated R (violence language) BOTTOM LINE Sharp satire and blunt allegory make for an uneven mix in this sci-fi flick. Sometimes fun but ultimately frustrating. CAST Matt Damon Sharlto Copley Alice Braga LENGTH 142 Matt Damon plays an angry and well-armed member of the 99 percent in ""Elysium"" the most blatantly political sci-fi movie of the summer if not of all time. Its written and directed by South Africas Neill Blomkamp whose brilliant debut ""District 9"" imagined an apartheid system of privileged humans and shantytown space aliens. ""Elysium"" gives us a giant slum called Earth whose populace supports a wealthy 1% ensconced in a pretty space station called Elysium. The year is 2154 the place is Los Angeles and Max (Damon bald and tattooed) is dying of radiation poisoning from a workplace accident. His health plan is lousy -- a robot prescribes daily pills ""until you are dead"" -- but Elysium has miracle MRIs that can cure anything. Unfortunately the machines function only for ""legal"" citizens and Elysium is well-defended by secretary Delacourt (a snooty Jodie Foster) who shoots ""undocumented"" ships on sight. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Blomkamp has fun setting up this combination of ""Escape From New York"" and Michael Moores ""Sicko."" Los Angeles looks like Mexico Elysium looks like Southampton and robocops everywhere keep the peace. Gradually though ""Elysium"" gets bogged down by a tortuous plot that defies its own internal logic. A coyote named Spider (Wagner Moura) hires Max to kidnap a CEO (East Meadows William Fichtner). For strength Max screws a metal exoskeleton to his body -- a cool idea but why doesnt everyone have one? Maxs childhood crush Frey (Alice Braga) and her dying daughter (Emma Tremblay) add sentiment but not substance. For all the complications ""Elysium"" is ultimately simple-minded. Maxs grand plan is to hack a database so that all ""illegal"" Earthlings become ""legal"" Elysians. Thematically this feels unsatisfying a trick rather than a triumph. Politically -- and this movie is always political -- the idea of simply opening the floodgates feels embarrassingly naive a grade-schoolers solution to immigration reform. Even in the context of a fanciful sci-fi film this bit of wishful thinking runs smack into the wall of realpolitik. ""Elysium"" serves up some imaginative effects and pyrotechnics most of them involving a black-ops nut job named Kruger (an outrageously good Sharlto Copley of ""District 9""). But the movie is both sloppy in its details and too literal in its thinking. A less blunt allegory might have made for sharper entertainment. 305 MoviesElysium trailer PLOT A dying man from the giant slum called Earth attempts to reach a space station reserved for the rich. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence language) CAST Matt Damon Sharlto Copley Alice Braga LENGTH 142 BOTTOM LINE Sharp satire and blunt allegory make for an uneven mix in this sci-fi flick. Sometimes fun but ultimately frustrating. MoviesThe 25 biggest box office hits of all time THROUGH DIRECTORS SCI-FI LOOKING GLASS ""Elysium"" director Neill Blomkamp a 33-year-old South African native with a background in digital effects and a head for sociopolitical tumult has emerged as a rarity among todays directors a maker of science fiction with soul. ""Whats somehow gone away from science fiction is that its meant to represent ideas"" says Blomkamp. ""Its meant to be this looking glass through which you can look at society a different way."" Whereas most science fiction today is all sleekness and impressive spaceships metaphor comes first for Blomkamp who sees ""Elysium"" in the tradition of Fritz Langs similarly allegorical ""Metropolis."" Set in 2154 ""Elysium"" finds Earth a slum with the wealthy living in an orbital space station. Blomkamp first caught Hollywoods eye for his commercial work and shorts including ""Alive in Joburg"" which he would later expand into the Oscar-nominated ""District 9."" The success of that 2009 film (it made 210.8 million worldwide) led to numerous studio offers of major franchise movies. ""I get offered those kind of films less and less now because I just seem to be saying no so much"" says Blomkamp. ""What I want to do for the next few films is find exactly my own voice."" advertisement | advertise on newsday -- The Associated Press Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Kimberley French Kimberley French Kimberley French Elysium Director Neill Blomkamp Cast Matt Damon Jodie Foster Sharlto Copley Rated R (bloody violence and strong language throughout) Running time 109 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1256am on Friday Aug. 09 2013 Friday Aug. 09 2013 Friday Aug. 09 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Exactly four years ago South African-born/Canadian-based director Neill Blomkamp released his stunning feature debut District 9. The film set in a near-future where disheveled abused aliens land on Earth only to find themselves shepherded into townships was an obvious but still effective allegory about apartheid.Now with his second film the more star-driven yet less powerful Elysium director/writer Blomkamp has tossed adie any sense of subtlety for a heavy-handed reprise of some of District 9s basic themes hog-tied to a riff on undocumented immigration.Its the late 22nd century and the world has bifurcated into polar opposites. The wealthy have fled Atlas Shrugged-style to an orbiting space station Elysium where they seem to do nothing but sip white wine and spice up their everyday conversations with a bit of French. Robots in case youre wondering do the dirty work.Meanwhile back in Los Angeles which looks like a giant polluted squatter camp the lingua franca is Spanish and these dirty downtrodden souls -- forbidden from visiting Elysium -- live in fear of the robot cops who are the eyes and ears of the overlords living above.But Max (Matt Damon) who seems to be the last non-Hispanic white guy in L.A. has had enough. An accident at his robot-assembly plant has left him drenched in so much radiation that he only has five days to live. He hatches a plot with some local toughs who are trying to launch shuttles to reach Elysium to break through the stations surprisingly meager defenses. Once there Max -- who as part of the plan has had himself surgically altered for maximum beatdown effect -- can get better immediately as every home comes standard with an MRI-like device that cures all diseases. (Why they also dont have technology for a halfway decent force field to keep intruders like Max out is never explained.)Also seeking treatment are his childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) and her young daughter who has leukemia. But before he can cure anything he has to go up against Elysiums head of defense an oddly accented Jodie Foster. She in turn has hired a mercenary named Kruger (Sharlto Copley the star of District 9) and his band of thugs to take out Max or any other Earth vermin that get in her way. If Max is successful others from Earth can come to Elysium to find a better life.As usual Damon -- with shaved head tatts and totally ripped body -- throws himself into the role with conviction. But Foster doesnt have much to do but look stern and Copley doesnt get to show off any of the range that he displayed in District 9. Blomkamp manages a few clever touches and has a keen visual sensibility -- you can practically feel the heat and smell the sweat of this future L.A. -- and he stages some kinetic action scenes. Naming his character Max also seems to be a nod to Mad Max the groundbreaking Australian film about a dystopian near-future where the meek inherit a scorched post-apocalyptic Earth.But the script is just too frustratingly simplistic. The bad guys -- including William Fichtner as the immaculately dressed uncaring corporate fat cat who is the head of the company responsible for Maxs radiation poisoning -- are less characters than caricatures and not particularly interesting ones.For his next film Chappie Blomkamp returns to South Africa for a story involving police robots working in the shantytowns and it seems to be thematically tied to both District 9 and Elysium.Heres hoping its closer in spirit to the former rather than the latter.

Starring Matt Damon in extra muscles and a shaven skull it contains enough hardware for all the Home Depots of the future and an atmosphere of grimy oppression one can almost taste. Futuristic science fiction is inherently political; very few ""preapocalyptic"" fantasies make their way to the mall because the question behind all the speculative fiction is How badly are we going to screw things up? Rather badly judging by ""Elysium"" the work of the South African-born writer-director Neill Blomkamp. In 2009 he made sci-fi fans out of the otherwise allergic with ""District 9"" an electric parable that wore its antiapartheid sentiments on its sleeve. That apartheid had been abolished 15 years earlier didnt make the film feel any less urgent. Watch a clip from the sci-fi action film ""Elysium"" starring Matt Damon Jodie Foster William Fichtner Sharlto Copley Diego Luna and Alice Braga. (Photo/Video Sony Pictures) Related How Elysium Stacks Up in the Summer of Sci-Fi In ""Elysium"" Mr. Blomkamp is again applying the here and now to the then and there but in less vaguely allegorical terms. In fact his terms are obvious and his agenda progressive-cum-socialist. The year is 2154. A dusty rusted wasted Earth has become the despoiled home of the have-nots; the haves are in residence aboard a wagon-wheel-shaped space station named for the Elysian Fields of the ancients Greeks the inside of which looks like Beverly Hills with better gardening and where each home is equipped with a medical pod designed to cure everything from mosquito bites to leukemia. Max (Mr. Damon) an ex-youthful ex-offender trying to toe the dictatorial line at his robot-factory job is exposed to lethal radiation given some painkillers and told to go home and die. He opts to join a plan to breach Elysium and liberate health care for the masses below. Mr. Damon brings both a weary optimism and convincing physicality to Max who is no revolutionary. He just wants to live and is willing to don an exoskeletal combat suit and fight robots to do it. Mr. Damon is surrounded by first-rate supporting actors who have been freed by Mr. Blomkamp from the usual expectations--notably William Fichtner who can play sleazy weasels in his sleep but here brings a very subtle characterization to the loathsome John Carlyle who carries the keys to Elysian security in his head--a space Max is going to vacuum clean once he gets past Carlyles armored guard. And theres the terrifying Jodie Foster as Elysiums defense secretary Delacourt who seems willing to stop at nothing to protect Elysian privilege including blowing children out of the skies. She says shell do it. And you believe her. Lovelace Watch a clip from the film ""Lovelace"" the story of Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) who is used and abused by the porn industry at the behest of her coercive husband (Peter Sarsgaard) before taking control of her life. (Photo/Video TWC) There arent many bright spots in ""Lovelace"" although one is Amanda Seyfrieds intoxicating smile and another is the retinal insult delivered by a 16mm projector flaring out at the audience during the movies opening moments and which feels like an accusation. Its the odd film that indicts you just for watching. But ""Lovelace"" is an eccentric piece of cinema made by unlikely people. ENLARGE Amanda Seyfried in Lovelace RADIUS-TWC Based on the harrowing memoir of the former Linda Susan Boreman--aka Linda Lovelace poster girl for ""porn chic"" back when the term didnt seem quite so ridiculous--the film is the work of two directors who have focused previously on gay subjects Rob Epstein of the monumental ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" (1984); and Jeffrey Friedman who has co-directed/edited with Mr. Epstein since their ""Common Threads Stories From the Quilt"" (1989). The duos documentaries--""Howl"" (2010) was their first scripted film--have seldom wallowed in martyrdom per se but in ""Lovelace"" their subject finds her Gethsemane in the Southern California porn industry of the 1970s and a Golgotha on the rickety altar of sexual liberation. She is a female sacrifice to predatory maleness; watching her makes us complicit. The problem for the directors who clearly are out to produce a commercial movie is how to make their heroine both a capital-V victim and La Pasionaria of 70s backlash. Whats as important to the film as the late Ms. Boremans story--of a repressed suburban girl beaten and abused into the erotic blockbuster ""Deep Throat""--is how Messrs. Epstein and Friedman tell that story. The images recall 70s porn or the blaxploitation films of the same period. The graphics are trippy and gaudy; the texture grainy; the period signifiers abundant--disco sequins giant perms. Theres a California sunniness to the setup and to the central character herself a guileless 20-odd-year-old naif of sweet nature and very little nurture Her mother played by a startling Sharon Stone is a poisonous iceberg; her ex-cop father (Robert Patrick) has all but checked out. Linda is tiny enough to sit sideways in a bathtub (a wonderfully vulnerable image) experienced enough to have given up a baby when she was 19 and clueless enough to buy the sales pitch of Chuck Traynor (Peter Saarsgard) a low-rent smoothie with a porn-star mustache and the morals of a grave robber. Its all very purposefully tawdry and tacky and yet innocent One of the reasons for ""Deep Throats"" mainstream acceptance or so they say was the stars Everygirl looks and nuance-free acting. But Messrs. Epstein and Friedman then downshift drastically. Having brought us along to the point where ""Deep Throat"" has become a hit it leaps ahead six years to a room in which Linda looking a bit like Simone Weil is undergoing a lie-detector test Her publisher wants to make sure shes not lying about the story shes planning to tell a story that the movie--as if returning to the scene of the crime--proceeds to regurgitate sans highlights and lip gloss. Theres a bit of a hiccup in the transition from ""then"" to ""now"" in their flashing back and forth. But the point of all the time travel is to correct the Linda Lovelace story as was told by her various exploiters including Traynor Hugh Hefner (James Franco) and ""Deep Throat"" director Gerard Damiano (Hank Azaria). With the exception of good-natured porn vet Harry Reems (Adam Brody) everyone here is out to tear a piece off Linda Lovelace whoever she was Messrs. Epstein and Friedman dont really get to what made her tick although one can guess. Mom who suggests a possessed Bess Myerson is an emotional terrorist. Dad--in a brilliant chilling turn by Mr. Patrick--tells his daughter by phone that hes seen her movie thus diminishing her tiny self even further and providing a cold slap in the face for those who didnt quite get the point when the flash of that projector stabbed them in the eye. In a World... Watch a clip from the film ""In a World..."" An underachieving vocal coach (Lake Bell) is motivated by her father the king of movie-trailer voice-overs to pursue her aspirations of becoming a voiceover star. (Photo/Video Roadside Attractions) The deliriously talented Lake Bell wrote produced directed and stars in this peculiar bit of comedy magic set amid the cutthroat world of Hollywood voiceover artists. The title? Its the line made famous by the real-life movie-trailer king Don LaFontaine (""In a world gone mad..."") whose death has been like a laryngectomy on the world of dubbing and looping. Who will fill the silence left behind? Were all rooting for Carol Solomon (Ms. Bell) underachieving vocal coach and gifted mimic who has grown up in the shadow of her vocal legend father Sam Sotto (Fred Melamed) and the rest of the misogynists who run the industry. These include the very waxed Gustav Werner (Ken Marino) with whom Carol has the bad taste to go to bed even though she really likes the goofily supportive Louis (Demetri Martin) who is out to help her snag the trailer gig for ""The Amazon Games"" a megabudgeted ""quadrilogy"" that sounds a lot like ""The Hunger Games."" Ms. Bell shows a deft directorial hand The female empowerment angle isnt overplayed the crisis between her sister and brother-in-law (a nice Michaela Watkins-Rob Corddry duet) is anxious-making in a good way and even her fathers shameless egotism is made palatable--both by Mr. Melamed who seems to be two-fifths manatee and one-fifth polar bear and his director whose voice can lure the cuckoos from the trees. I Give It a Year Watch a clip from the film ""I Give It a Year."" Newlywed couple Nat (Rose Byrne) and Josh (Rafe Spall) are deliriously happy despite their differences though friends and family arent convinced that they can last. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) I give it a weekend. Written and directed by Dan Mazer this painful misfire was probably on paper promising enough Take a London couple totally unsuited to each other apply the tropes of standard romantic comedy and allow the hilarity to ensue. Shockingly the kind of cringe-inducing material upon which Mr. Mazer has built a career as a writer for Sacha Baron Cohen (""Bruno"" ""Borat"" ""Da Ali G Show"") doesnt work when rendered by types who could have been cast in ""Notting Hill"" (someone even makes a Hugh Grant joke). Its rather close to excruciating. ENLARGE Rafe Spall and Rose Byrne in I Give It a Year Magnolia Pictures ""I Give It a Year"" stars the always very pretty Rose Byrne as Nat an advertising exec and Rafe Spall as Josh a struggling writer who meet and marry in about the time it takes to complete the opening credits. They have a wedding that couldnt be more a portent of doom. And they spend the next 90 minutes in pursuit of an escape hatch. The glorious Anna Faris and ""Mentalist"" Simon Baker play the people Josh and Nat were meant to be with and you do sort of wish those two had escaped the movie hand in hand and avoided all these other very unpleasant people. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE District 9 (c)Sony Pictures/Everett Collection District 9 (2009) This critically acclaimed feature debut of writer-director and former visual-effects specialist Neill Blomkamp flips the customary premise of the space-invasion movie When a bedraggled race of aliens lands on Earth they dont even try to take over. Theyre herded into camps treated like animals exploited for their technology and subjected to the brutality of policies that recall apartheid which was clearly Mr. Blomkamps metaphorical point. But nothing distracts from the kinetic energy of the direction the all-too-believable world Mr. Blomkamp creates or the performance by newcomer Sharlto Copley currently playing the villainous Kruger in Mr. Blomkamps ""Elysium."" ENLARGE Over Her Dead Body Over Her Dead Body (2008) Intended as Eva Longorias post-""Desperate Housewives"" breakout movie it was stolen from her by the infectiously funny Lake Bell whose Ashley--a combination caterer/psychic--tries to help Henry (Paul Rudd) get in touch with his dead fiancee Kate (Ms. Longoria) who was crushed by an ice sculpture intended for their wedding. Ashley likes Henry Henry likes Ashley; Kates ghost cant stand it and tries to sabotage the romance. Its a premise straight out of ""Blithe Spirit"" though the only aspects worthy of Noel Coward are Ms. Bells sense of the absurd and gifted timing. ENLARGE Boogie Nights Boogie Nights (1997) The ""Nashville"" of the porn industry and a film that increases in stature as the years go by Paul Thomas Andersons sophomore effort contains remarkable performances from a veritable mob of actors in parts large and small--Burt Reynolds Julianne Moore Heather Graham Philip Seymour Hoffman John C. Reilly Thomas Jane Philip Baker Hall Alfred Molina and of course Mark Wahlberg as the studly Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler.

(Stephanie Blomkamp) By Ann Hornaday August 8 2013 Follow AnnHornaday With ""Elysium"" a nightmarish action thriller set in an apocalyptic future South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp proves that hes the reigning master of dystopian political allegory. In his stunning 2009 debut ""District 9"" he used a similarly downbeat sci-fi story as a wildly imaginative allegory for his countrys apartheid past and its present-day artifacts. ""Elysium"" doesnt pack nearly the same startling punch and its political agenda is far more ham-handed but Blomkamp shows that along with such contemporaries as Rian Johnson (""Looper"") and Duncan Jones (""Moon"" ""Source Code"") hes part of an innovative generation breathing new life into a time-honored genre. Set in 2154 ""Elysium"" takes place in Los Angeles a polluted overpopulated chaotic police state run by greedy corporate interests and ruthless robo-cops and where an ex-convict named Max (Matt Damon) works in a factory making the armed metallic thugs who routinely oppress him. With his head shaven to a cue-ball sheen his body covered in tattoos and his ankle encased in a low-jack Damon all but abandons his clean-cut image to play a buff cynical anti-hero. When Max is sent on a mission to Elysium an elite satellite compound that whirls like a seductive giant hood ornament hundreds of miles from ravaged Earth its not to save mankind but to save himself. Not surprisingly Maxs tough-guy reserve will crack in this instance after an encounter with his childhood love played by Alice Braga. And once hes outfitted with a set of computerized armor in a gruesomely graphic sequence set in a human chop shop Max becomes something of a super-anti-hero -- a one-man intra-galactic Dream Act who promises to open up the wealth serenity and cure-all health-care system of the ultimate gated community for the huddled masses teeming below its airspace. To do that he must conquer Elysiums ice queen of a defense secretary played by Jodie Foster with an indeterminate accent and stylish cool worthy of Christine Lagarde (even Fosters wrist communicator is by Bulgari). And he must overpower her most deranged minion a mercenary monster named Kruger played by ""District 9"" star Sharlto Copley with manic touches of mean-spirited wit. As a commentary on contemporary wealth disparities environmental degradation and immigration issues ""Elysium"" is arguably too on-the-nose. Blomkamps admirable if obvious egalitarianism too often devolves into simplistic wish-fulfillment. Still his formidable visual imagination is on full display in a movie that has spared nothing in persuasively bringing to life both an inhumane terrestrial world and the whirling gyre of protection and privilege above it. (Like ""Pacific Rim"" earlier this summer ""Elysium"" features a distressed scuffed-up version of the future in which once-shiny machines are now rusty and covered with graffiti.) And as in ""District 9"" the filmmaker exhibits a strong penchant for blowing peoples heads off in liquid Ralph Steadman-like blurs. A high-low tension runs through ""Elysium"" not only in the narrative itself but in Blomkamps own cinematic language which can be lofty one moment and gleefully pulpy the next. If that juxtaposition isnt quite as bracing as it was in ""District 9"" Blomkamp is still clearly on his own mission to bring new intelligence and even principles to bear on a genre too often dominated by banal cyborgs and recycled plots. The future he imagines may be grim but the one he represents is full of promise. 1/2 R. At area theaters.

"Elysium | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; elysium ) Elysium (United States 2013) August 08 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Elysium is a thoroughly entertaining science fiction/action spectacle that reinforces the argument that director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has what it takes to enthrall audiences. However I cant help but wishing this material had been given ""the HBO miniseries treatment."" One of the first rules of film criticism is to review whats on the screen but damn I wish Elysium had been provided with the time and space to breathe. Blomkamps universe is a fascinating place to visit and the movie is stuffed with ideas - theres far too much here to satisfactorily explore in 109 minutes especially when one considers that room must be made for action scenes. I departed the theater satisfied with what Id seen but wanting more. Elysium is set in the mid-22nd century. An overpopulated polluted Earth has been abandoned by its wealthiest citizens for Elysium a Stanford torus space station paradise. Those who remain on the planet are the dregs of society - manual laborers criminals and those struggling to make a living while gazing up longingly at the great wheel in the sky where advanced medical care is available for all the lawns are immaculately groomed and theres no crime or want. The films opening moments dramatize this with a series of captivating visuals contrasting the cramped grimy environs of Los Angeles endless cityscape with the pacific beauty of Elysium. And although nothing that follows quite matches the majesty of the introduction its a terrific way to set up a movie. After establishing the setting Blomkamp introduces us to his protagonist Max DeCosta (Matt Damon) an ex-car thief who has gone straight. On parole he has left behind his old life and gotten a regular job. The temptation to go back is always there however represented by his buddy Julio (Diego Luna). A reminder of more pleasant times is Frey (Alice Braga) a childhood crush who returns to his life as an adult woman with a terminally ill daughter. After a workplace accident Max finds himself in the same category as Freys child although his prognosis is worse. He has five days to live unless he discovers a way to get to Elysium and gain access to its advanced medical facilities. Under normal circumstances this would merely be ""difficult"" but Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is organizing a coup with the help of billionaire John Carlyle (William Fichtner) thereby potentially destabilizing the political system and putting Elysium in a state of high alert. Plus Max doesnt have the money necessary to buy passage on an illegal shuttle so he is forced to agree to go on a dangerous mission kidnap Carlyle. The task is made more challenging by the arrival of Delacourts unbalanced ""operative"" Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Elysium contains plenty of generic action scenes for those who get excited about such things. In some ways Maxs tale plays out a little like a superhero origin story with Kruger filling the part of the ""supervillain."" There are a couple of noteworthy fight scenes - one on Earth and one on Elysium - that are adeptly directed although not groundbreaking. Elysium does take some chances and at least one plot development is surprising. While the productions testosterone quotient is filled in the Matt Damon scenes I was ultimately more interested in those featuring Jodie Foster as the scheming would-be president. Sadly the political subtext remains mostly in the background being employed only to the extent necessary to advance the plot. As a result Delacourt is less well-developed than she might have been. The same cant be said of Kruger who as played by District 9s Sharlto Copley is an amazingly nasty piece of work. The performance reminded me of Gerald Butlers bravura contribution to 300 except in this case were dealing with a demented example of cybernetic engineering. Copley dominates every scene in which he appears including those with Matt Damon. Damon having gained credibility for action films with his three Jason Bourne outings is believable as Max but the character is a little bland. We become invested in his struggle mainly because Copley who opposes him is so deliciously evil. Is the movie thinly-veiled ""liberal propaganda"" as has been claimed by some pundits? Not really. Yes the Earth of the future is portrayed as an overpopulated hellhole with a barely breathable atmosphere and theres an obvious class schism but these arent new ideas to science fiction which often brims with allegory. And Blomkamp is likely drawing on the recent history of his native South Africa for inspiration. If theres something to complain about its not Elysiums politics but the facile manner in which the resolution occurs. Suspending disbelief is fine but the films ending challenges the viewers ability to accept a few rather improbable events. Elysium enters the movie marketplace as twilight is falling on the 2013 blockbuster season. Its sufficiently different from everything released in the past few months to make it worth a look even for those suffering from ""blockbuster fatigue"" but it isnt the kind of original cant-miss surprise Blomkamp gave us with District 9. The R-rating garnered primarily because of violence and gore makes this a more adult experience than the summers sanitized PG-13 cavalcade which is in and of itself refreshing. Its well paced and looks great two qualities that cant be overemphasized when dealing with something that aspires to pack multiplex auditoriums.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like it or not (and some certainly wont) ""Elysium"" is rare and valuable among recent summer blockbusters most simply because it proves worthy of conversation beyond the usual ""You know I think the obliteration of [Major City X] at the end was wicked awesome"" and ""Yeah man -- me too."" For starters writer/director Neil Blomkamps futurist dystopia -- wherein the worlds richest 1 percent live in gated-community paradise leaving the vast majority of others to tough it out in squalor -- raises the question of whether this sci-fi epics dateline deserves to be 2154 or somewhere closer to 2014. Indeed for all the films ultraviolent wicked-awesome action following factory worker Max (Matt Damon) in his desperate attempt to get decent health care the movie bids to work the brain as strenuously as it does the body. More talking points Is ""Elysium"" too political for a summer movie? Isnt every summer movie political when you think about it? Is Jodie Fosters coldly villainous defense secretary intended to invoke Hillary Clinton? And what does it mean that Blomkamp (""District 9"") hails from South Africa? Whats great about ""Elysium"" is that it invites and even encourages discussion and debate while delivering proficiently at the levels of plot action and special effects. As the film opens Max is a young orphan (played by Maxwell Perry Cotton) who dreams of traveling to Elysium the space-station sanctuary just outside Earths atmosphere where rich people live forever in perfect health -- sort of like having an extended Bel Air country club membership or an eternal all-access pass to Epcot Center. Later as a downtrodden adult and recovering thief bald-shaven Max toils on an assembly line in whats left of Los Angeles hauntingly rendered by Blomkamp in helicopter shots that recall the opening of ""Blade Runner"" and on the ground in ways that suggest the most impoverished sections of contemporary Cape Town and Mexico City. The great irony of Maxs work is that hes forced to participate in his own oppression -- helping to build the high-tech robo-cops that beat him and other workers for no good reason other than to keep them down. ELYSIUM 1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating R for strong bloody violence and language throughout. On the job Max bullied into life-endangering service by his brute of a supervisor gets a lethal dose of radiation leaving him with a mere five days to live. Thus the movie incorporates elements of the classic film noir ""D.O.A."" with Max fighting a ticking clock to find an antidote. For this he consults Spider (a brilliant Wagner Moura) a well-connected gangster who offers Max safe passage to disease-curing Elysium in trade for his help in hacking into the computerized brain of a bigwig CEO (William Fichtner). One could read what follows as socialism in action -- and/or as a bold and imaginative sci-fi film built to last long beyond its opening weekend. Blomkamps tone is bleak but not oppressively so as Damons Max melded with computer parts to enable a ""cerebral upload"" of classified data gradually becomes a sympathetic terminator straining to save not only his own life but that of his childhood friends diseased young daughter (Emma Tremblay). Or maybe the movie is merely a despicably left-wing up-with-the-underclass tract? Or a conservative vision of the right to bear arms? Feel free -- even though its summer -- to discuss.

It seems contradictory but the secret ingredient in a great science-fiction film is realism. We want to see a reflection of the world we inhabit even if its coming from another planet. In the case of ""Elysium"" the titular outpost is a satellite circling the earth. If you recognize this world of mansions and swimming pools from your personal experience congratulations. The rest of us will surely recognize the world below a polluted place where the masses fight for survival under the watchful eye of armed guards. This vision of a violent future makes ""Elysium"" well worth seeing even as the conventional violence of the thriller finale makes it a missed opportunity.The setting is the late 21st century. High above the earth a giant hamster wheel called Elysium shelters the richest citizens in luxurious style. Meanwhile down below in parched and polyglot Los Angeles reformed car thief Max (Matt Damon muscled and shorn of hair) tries to evade the same robo-cops he helps build in a factory.A segment where the killer robots order Max to report to his parole officer (another robot covered in graffiti and impervious to Maxs sardonic humor) promises a social satire as pointed as director Neill Blomkamps previous film ""District 9."" But after Max gets an industrial dose of radiation and needs to reach Elysium for life-saving medical treatment the movie gets sidetracked into a too-familiar chase narrative. An outlaw hacker called Spider (Wagner Moura) agrees to smuggle Max onto a space flotilla if first he can kidnap a visiting factory owner (William Fichtner) whose brain contains codes that can free the population thats stuck on Earth. The scene where Spiders tattooed henchmen fit Max with a cyborgian exoskeleton is another feat of FX wizardry. The gear enables Max to go toe-to-jackboot with an assassin (Sharlto Copley) who is unleashed by the Secretary of Defense (Jodie Foster affecting a bad South African accent). But tin-man Max has a heart and he entangles his lost love a nurse named Frey (Alice Braga) into the mission along with her dying daughter.The rationing of medical care is another potent theme that Blomkamp stuffs into his script but when Max and his rebel brethren crash-land on the satellite subtlety is jettisoned for bombastic music and shaky-cam shootouts. Nonetheless there are wonders to behold in ""Elysium"" and lessons to file in the collective consciousness for the coming showdown.

Photo Kimberley French Sony Pictures Elysium review Foster Damon in future world 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Elysium Science fiction. Starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Directed by Neill Blomkamp. (R. 109 minutes.) In the mid-22nd century there is no middle class. The poor live on a polluted and diseased Earth where jobs are lousy and scarce and where the police are robots who rough people up at will. And the rich live on a beautiful colony built on a man-made satellite Elysium where the weather is good houses are mansions and every disease is instantly curable. If sometime in the future someone wants to figure out what people in 2013 were worried about ""Elysium"" will be a good place to start. Its not a monster movie in which all the terrors of life are rolled up into one big metaphor nor does it express concerns about current politics or terrorism. The focus here is on one thing what might happen if the plutocrats were to get everything they want a world in which a small minority lives off the hardship and labor of everybody else. So ""Elysium"" is an action movie made for people thinking about something besides things blowing up. If at times the films connections between todays world and the fantasy world are broadly drawn an obvious idea is better than no idea at all. Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp ""Elysium"" has a family resemblance to Blomkamps earlier film ""District 9"" with its mix of a thoroughly realized dystopian future with an underlying social concern. This is how bad the Earth is in 2154 Matt Damon cant leave the house and walk down the street without someone messing with him. He plays Max a former car thief who lives in a hovel and works in a factory. As he waits at a bus stop one morning a drone police officer starts questioning him and a minute later Max has a broken forearm. He cant take a day off though - no unions. So he goes to work where he is abused by his foreman. Later he meets his parole officer yet another machine who wont let him get a word in but does encourage him to take tranquilizers. So very quickly we get the point. Life on Earth is hardly worth living. Yet all the while in the sky a little closer than the moon is the wheel-shaped paradise Elysium which most people will never get to visit. Jodie Foster plays Mrs. Delacourt the defense secretary of the Elysium colony who could very well be French - that might be the accent Foster is going for. This is one of Fosters best showcases in a while a character who is Fosters complete opposite philosophically - a heartless elitist who cares about no one - but who yet is in Fosters general zone in terms of temperament a smart disciplined know-it-all masklike in presentation unshakeable in self-belief. Blomkamps cleverly constructed screenplay follows two story lines that converge. On Elysium Delacourt is hatching a political scheme that will thrust her to the center of power. Meanwhile on Earth a workplace accident makes it necessary for Max to get to Elysium soon in order to have any hope of cure. Blomkamp lays out the terms of this world - a citizens powerlessness the unending surveillance - so that at all times the audience can feel both the seeming hopelessness of escape as well as the desperate need to escape. Blomkamp also provides the actors with roles they can actually inhabit and discover. As Delacourt Foster is arresting as an evil person with many admirable enviable qualities. As the leader of the Los Angeles underworld Wagner Moura gets to play not a cliched gangster but a mix of good and bad a man dealing with various stresses and allegiances. Its a rich colorful performance grounded in solid character writing. And of course theres Matt Damon the actor who is always easy to overlook because hes always exactly what the story demands. Damon shows you everything without trying to show you anything - at least without seeming like hes trying. Hes like looking into clear water.

Just as writer-director Neill Blomkamp intended. Matt Damon stars as Max a reluctant hero who in trying to save his own life might just change the course of his fellow Earth-bound inhabitants. With his second feature the South African-born director of 2009s ""District 9"" confirms he knows how to create a convincing if ruined and morally compromised vision of the future for multiplex audiences. The movie opens in 2154 upon a long-devastated L.A. Its an image of dun desolation where a kind of daily chaos mixes it up with social regimentation. Max is an ex-con working in a factory that builds the type of robots that keep citizens just like him in line literally and figuratively. Elysium is the name of the vast upscale space station that orbits above Earth. But the movies title also gives a heady nod to the fictional and perfect land the Greeks wrote about centuries ago. Jodie Foster brings a chilly glare a drawn mouth and a French accent to Elysiums secretary of defense Delacourt. Theres much to defend ""A way of life"" as they say. And shes the hard-liner to do it. Citizens here dont get sick They slip into a machine and their cells are regenerated lickety-split. When Kruger the mercenary in Delacourts employ (played by ""District 9"" star Sharlto Copley) gets grievously wounded dont worry. Its hardly a spoiler to say hell be back. Health care is part of the allure the space station holds for those brave or desperate enough to hazard the journey across the space-border They may be able to cure their loved ones if theyre able to land on Elysium escape capture -- and get the right coding. The director has a true talent for visually imagining worlds in conflict. Full of adrenaline-rousing action ""Elysium"" seems to move effortlessly through the landscapes it creates the slum Max and old partner in crime Julio (a soulful Diego Luna) live in the spirit-crushing factory Max works at the hospital his childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) is a nurse at the black-market and the nerve center of coyote/revolutionary Spider (Brazilian star Wagner Moura). A sci-fi fable about what ails us at this peculiar moment ""Elysium"" is not without flaws. Its ruined Los Angeles appears overrun with Hispanics. Spanish is the language spoken at the orphanage Max is raised in. Whos vision of catastrophic failure is this exactly? Then again one might argue that the movies vision of Elysiums lucky few also represents a fear/fantasy projection. Its 1-percenter world is as clean lush and mostly white as Earth is dusty desiccated and mostly populated by brown-skinned people. Its the extremes that doom us.

"Elysium movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Salvation for the 99 percent in Elysium Director Neill Blomkamp and star Matt Damon navigate a sci-fi story of harsh class warfareAugust 08 2013|Michael PhillipsMatt Damon stars in Columbia Pictures ""Elysium."" (Kimberley French HANDOUT)Viewed from an aerial narrative perspective writer-director Neill Blomkamps 22nd-century-set ""Elysium"" is about an ex-con factory worker (played by Matt Damon) a man suffering from a radiation dosage strong enough to kill anyone whose name isnt above his movies title. Max Damons character dedicates an eventful few days on a decrepit polluted Earth and a fancy gated community in the sky to ensuring legal citizenship and health care coverage for all.With most films thatd be enough to cut out half the potential American audience. But effective evocative science fiction which ""Elysium"" is has a way of getting by with an ILA (Insidious Liberal Agenda) in the guise of worst-case dystopia.Loaded with action a lot of it excitingly imagined ""Elysium"" boasts many of the teeming strengths of South African filmmaker Blomkamps previous R-rated sci-fi success ""District 9"" (2009) which replayed a host of immigration and apartheid themes with humans and aliens. This time were in a world photographed mostly in and around Mexico City standing in for a dusty forbidding Los Angeles after the destruction of the ozone layer. Up in space the richest of the rich swan around in beautiful clothes and apparently endless sunshine on an immense space station known as Elysium. This carefully manicured Eden resembles the better parts of your tonier Southern California enclaves without the conspicuous service industry underclass.On Elysium everything from a broken wrist to cancer can be cured by a quick lie-down in the home-installed ""med bay."" On Elysium the fearsome defense secretary in cahoots with EPI (Evil Private Industry personified by William Fichtner) is played by Jodie Foster. By design her performance is only slightly less robotic than the Maschinenmensch robot woman Maria in Fritz Langs ""Metropolis"" a major influence on Blomkamps movie.After Max suffers the life-threatening radiation blast in an industrial accident he joins forces with an underground revolutionary (Wagner Moura) intent on kidnapping Elysiums CEO. In exchange Max receives his sole hope for survival a free ride on an illegal flight to the promised land where he can be cured in a near-instant.Start to finish ""Elysium"" puts its main man through the mill. With only days to live Max must fend off attacks from a psychotic mercenary recently let go from Elysiums payroll. Hes played by Sharlto Copley the feverish overactor who starred in ""District 9.""Damon has an awfully good nose for material; even when ""Elysium"" grows allegorically simplistic or familiar the script avoids pounding cliche and Blomkamp and his design and effects teams give us a plausibly harsh idea of things to come.Some things are fun such as the bubblelike opaque cocoons designed to keep 22nd-century bullets from doing any harm. Other things decidedly are not fun such as the artful panoramic vistas revealing just how lousy a life well be inheriting in the year 2154.As did Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men"" (2006) ""Elysium"" relies on a protagonist who isnt puffed up with bravado the way a prototypical Tom Cruise hero tends to be in these kinds of stories. Damon has true regular-guy appeal and while she hasnt enough to play Alice Braga (as his childhood sweetheart) matches up well with Damons man on the run. I like Blomkamps casting; were spending time with a multinational array of interesting faces and voices. The future according to ""Elysium"" may rest on the shoulders of a bankable likable American movie star but hes fighting for something larger than himself.mjphillipstribune.comElysium - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for strong bloody violence and language throughout)Running time 149Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPreview Review Elysium Extended TrailerJune 13 2013Sony MRC Reunite With Neill Blomkamp on ChappieAugust 13 2013Updated Vices Motherboard Postpones Sci-Fi Film ContestMay 23 2013Film Reviews Opening This Week (Aug. 5-9 2013)August 10 2013Find More Stories AboutMatt DamonElysiumIlaWilliam FichtnerTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0806-elysium-20130808,0,7963213.column",200,elysium27,elysium,chicagotribune

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Neill Blomkamps Elysium Dark and Dysto-pointing The director of District 9 creates a dark dense future world where not much new happens By Richard Corliss Aug. 08 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Kimberley French / Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Four summers ago South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp sprung District 9 on a world that didnt know it wanted to see a science-fiction parable about apartheid. The world applauded the 29-year-olds imagination in creating sympathetic if uggy space monsters who looked like giant prawns -- no George Carlin this time ""jumbo shrimp"" is not an oxymoron -- and his dexterity in injecting a political agenda into a grab-you-by-the-throat action scenario. That the whole fabulous enterprise cost only 30 million and earned 200 million at the worldwide box office made him a darling to the money men as well as to the cinemascenti. The message Blomkamp seems to have taken from the praise for District 9 is more politics less narrative wallop. Elysium which at least triples the first films budget and adds Matt Damon and Jodie Foster as marquee bait spends less time appealing to the viewers What-comes-next? impulse than on elaborate social metaphors. The result is a grim and predictable adventure saga that is not nimble but leaden. Dystopia has rarely been so dysto-pointing. (READ Corlisss review of District 9) In 2154 -- the same year in which Avatar is set -- the wealthy have fled Earth to pursue lives of chic indolence on Elysium a luxurious satellite a 19-minute flight away where Defense Secretary Delacourt (Foster) is plotting a coup. Down in Los Angeles robocops patrol the violent streets; the city has become an ugly crime lab for Hispanic thugs and a few lowlife Anglos. One of these the ex-con Max (Damon) gets a radiation overdose that can be cured only on Elysium. He has five days to live. To reach the satellite and receive treatment he agrees to a data-heist scheme that could kill him by sundown. Elysium posits a blend of two clashing political scenarios the Occupy Wall Street notion of the 1% enslaving the 99% and the Tea Party fear of Latinos turning American cities into Rio-style favelas. But wait theres more. The illegals keep trying to invade the promised land to overthrow the Richie Riches and to get access to free life-saving medical care. Through some industrial-strength brain surgery Max is implanted with crucial secret data downloaded from the brain of Elysiums top techie entrepreneur (William Fichtner) who may as well be Steve Jobs to Maxs Edward Snowden. And of course there are drones monitoring the underclass and attacking them at whim. In the movies macro- and microcosmic view 2154 is a nightmare extension of 2013. (SEE The Elysium trailer) Blomkamp spends most of his ingenuity on the contrast of the two landscapes. Elysium an enclave of Miami-style mansions and sterile office warrens. L.A. a filthy barrio the walls scarred with graffiti the mens bodies fetishized with tattoos -- Damons torso is its own garish artwork. If the city were a Monopoly board every square would be Jail. (For further political piquancy Blomkamp shot some of the Elysium scenes in posh Vancouver the L.A. barrio scenes in fetid Mexico City.) The color is desaturated to the point of exhaustion in the one big summer action film too poor or too proud to use 3-D. The context and subtext are plenty imposing here. Whats missing is the text an engaging plot. Blomkamp stitches patches from a bunch of other sci-fi films -- the rich-poor futureworld of Gattaca In Time and Upside Down plus the mind-melding caper from Inception -- that devolve into a numbingly familiar series of chases and fights. For the token romantic interest he has Max bond with an ER nurse named Frey (gorgeous Alice Braga who has played this same role the Angel of Dystopia in City of God I Am Legend and Blindness). Guess what? They knew each other as children -- orphans in a convent And guess what else? Max has five days to live and Freys daughter Matilda (Emma Tremblay) is dying of leukemia. Puh-lease. Cant a movie stir tension without endangering a childs life? (READ Corlisss review of In Time) Foster as Elysiums Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney seems stranded on the satellite her acting skills left back on Earth. Flaunting (in Iowa congressman Steve Kings colorful phrase) calves the size of cantaloupes she spits out her nefarious schemes in an accent that roams vagrantly across the English-speaking world in the space of a sentence. Damon back in his wily-prole Jason Bourne identity gets a nice moment early in the film when he is interrogated by a robocop who cant take or understand Maxs jokes. (In 2154 humor is subversion and sarcasm a felony.) But for half of the movie hes imprisoned in a metal brain case making viewer empathy a real challenge. Like the stars of two other recent sci-fi downers -- Tom Cruise in Oblivion and Will Smith in After Earth -- Damon must forsake his natural screen charm to play a gruff character whos just this side of human. (READ Reviews of Oblivion and After Earth) District 9 managed a graceful entertaining fusion of political satire some sensational monster CGI and a wry narrative take on interspecies friendship. Elysium for all its visual and allegorical density could use the input of that gifted filmmaker. Somebody get Neill Blomkamp to save Neill Blomkamp.

Whatever you call it strap in for a wild ride. South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp who busted us out of a death march of crap summer epics with 2009s District 9 does it again. Like District 9 an allegory of apartheid that took four Oscar nods and put Blomkamp on the map Elysium delivers sci-fi without dumbing it down. Its a hell-raiser with a social conscience. More News Matt Damons Physical Evolution Elysium Is Sci-Fi Without the Stupid All Stories >> The year is 2154. A ruined overpopulated Earth looks like a garbage dump in Mexico City (where Elysium was partly filmed) and Matt Damon - tattooed head shaved armored with attitude - is taking massive shit from droids robots who run the place for the onepercenters. Theyre the privileged few who live on Elysium a space station orbiting Earth and run with an iron hand and no mercy by Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster killing it) a Dick Cheney in heels. Damons Max Da Costa is a factory slave who helps engineer those droids. But he cant resist pissing them off. Blomkamps script bristles with biting humor which Damon lets rip. To play Max Blomkamp had approached Eminem who impractically insisted they shoot in his native Detroit. No matter. Damon could not be better. Hes a dynamo with a gift for digging deep finding passion and purpose in the cynical Max. What makes Max storm Elysium? One reason Its personal. When Max is irradiated in a factory accident hes given five days to live. Only Elysium offers an instant cure. With an exoskeleton of armor painfully welded into his body Max gets his rockets going. Elysium is slicker than District 9 and sometimes shouts its themes about immigration poverty pollution and health care. And Blomkamp will surely take flak for wrapping those themes in a popcorn movie that revels in head-spinning action. The fight scenes with Damon and fab Sharlto Copley as a nut-job villain are a total blast. But its Blomkamps balls-out approach to blending brains with brawn that lifts him above the spineless herd. Elysium is the unruly antidote to the fatuous futurism of After Earth. It sticks with you. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

While Neill Blomkamps 2009 debut was a bracing blast of whipsmart sci-fi the work of a committed writer-director with talent and integrity to burn Elysium feels like the product of a cautious Hollywood committee. It retains the action-movie-with-a-social-conscience template of District 9 but ditches that films sense of dizzying anything-goes vitality. Matt Damon is sturdy - if a little faceless - as the futuristic blue-collar grunt whose life nosedives when he receives a fatal-in-five-days radioactive blast at work. His only hope is to get to Elysium the orbiting paradise reserved exclusively for the rich and heartless run by Jodie Fosters clipped frosty and unconvincingly French CEO. There are moments in Elysium which recapture the breath-stopping intensity of Blomkamps debut most of them involving South African actor Sharlto Copley as a mangled Afrikaans mercenary the only character here with any spark. The special effects are uniformly superb and a handful of action sequences - including a magnificent mid-film Smart car heist - justify the price of admission. But this is a messy poorly structured film riddled with plot holes and lacking any kind of satisfying conclusion. Perhaps its another case of raised expectations from a first-timer Elysium might seem more exciting. But in the wake of District 9 were all too aware what this risk-taking filmmaker is capable of and its far more than this conceptually bold sporadically engaging but ultimately bland blockbuster.

Ultimately critics and reviewers will pan the film simply because theyre unaware of the sci-fi tropes and themes that it references. Like Tarantino Blomkamp is demanding engagement from the viewer and when one is able to shunt disbelief aside and enter his world the brilliance of his vision and his technical ability in portraying it make it an emotionally and intellectually satisfying experience. This is Asimov meets Orwell it shows a depth of understanding of the nature and evolution of technology as well as the essential structures that produce it that should make most political scientists feel ashamed. Blomkamp isnt producing summer block buster entertainment for the American masses hes trying to create something artistic. This is not Lady Gaga its the White Stripes. A lot of critics will miss the joy of this movie by trying to watch it in terms of a summer blockbuster instead of being aware that this is a director who will never (at least we hope) produce anything that Hollywood wants him to make. Blomkamp heavily references the scientific types found in novels like Dune and gives them a feeling of reality that is almost creepily grounded in today. A lot of critics ask questions like ""how did people end up on Elysium"". Well how have rich people in any time period distanced themselves from the masses? The answer is slowly. This is a film that will ultimately be beyond people who have never seen or noted how extreme income disparities develop and who have no feeling for how political economy works thorough technology. As such many critics will try to cast it as a parody or satire of todays world but in doing so will miss the point completely. This is the world of today taken to its logical end. Solid acting by Matt Damon who plays the everyman with a sort of pent up aggression thats important to the role. Jodie Fosters role is delightful but ultimately if a movie is defined by the quality of its villain Foster is an antagonist but not the ultimate evil. Thats reserved for Sharlito Copley whos portrayal of Agent M Kruger bring chills all the more so because his type of existence and the nature of his evil are so well recorded in history. But youd have to know some history to know that and so we come back to the point; Elysium is an intelligent film for intelligent people and many critics will bash it simply because they dont get it. I certainly dont expect the editor of Time Out London to do so. Frankly I hope Blomkamp simply ignores them.

Planet Earth is a dump and Elysium is a place in orbit around the Earth. That is the best bit. After this it is just fighting non stop. Jodie Foster gives the worst performance of her life speaking in a robotic monotone voice for no particular reason. Anyway she dies half way through which is a relief.

The special effects are good (hence it gets a star) but the plot is wafer thin and not particularly well constructed and the film just lacks any subtlety and lightness. Well before the end I was thinking that the film was getting quite tedious and there was nt a great ending to make me change my mind. I would advise going into this film with low expectations so that you are not disappointed but even better advice would be not to go to it at all.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 22 2013critiqueFeaturedFair-to-middling sci-fi action drama anchored solidly by Damon but spoiled by Sharlto Copley`s OTT villain. Jodie Foster goes through the motions struggling with a bizarre accent.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 22 2013Justin BerkoviFeaturedI couldnt disagree more with Time Outs review. Messy? Needing a satisfying conclusion? Come ON Cinema doesnt have to be popcorn fodder to be good cinema. With District 9 Blomkamp showed visionary talent. Not only was the subject matter dealt with in a very poignant way but the humour and human element of the bizarre in the film worked so well. Whilst District 9 was often hard to watch Elysium is a little toned down (Perhaps by the studio?). Nevertheless there is much to applaud with Elysium. Firstly the visuals are nothing short of spectacular and I am pleased that 3D was not considered here. If you grew up in the 70s and 80s you might remember the awe inspiring NASA visuals that showcase what future worlds in space might look like. A stroke of genius Blomkamp uses these to superb effect in Elysium. The proximity of the paradise to Earth and the hardware employed by the film is so believable that you become immersed in the situation almost immediately - Earth is decimated and Elysium is an unaffordable paradise. Whilst there is not as strong a narrative as District 9 Elysium serves perhaps more as a day in the life of the situation. There are too many themes to discuss here but the idea of healthcare provision and its failings is explored as a core theme. This must resonate with many Americans. I came away wanting to watch more. Blomkamp has a lovely way of directing his actors he has a serious respect for his subject matter and doesnt ruin it by delving into awful comedy but simultaneously there are some genuinely funny moments. Sharlto Copley is hilarious as a psychotic agent. Brutal quirky and completely nuts. I came away from the film wanting another hour or so simply because I loved the visuals the story the world the characters. Blomkamp has created the best sci fi since Star Wars - his visual style is beautifully rendered its almost poetic. His characters are brutal but human and the way he lets the camera linger allows us wonderful fleeting moment of human sentiment. A superb film I cant wait for his next.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 22 2013Justin BerkoviFeaturedI couldnt disagree more with Time Outs review. Messy? Needing a satisfying conclusion?

"Elysium 2.5 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Elysium 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Elysium Bad to fair 2.5 stars Director Neill Blomkamp.Cast Matt Damon Jodie Foster Sharlto Copley.Rating R for strong bloody violence and language throughout. RELATED NEWS Best Matt Damon films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Aug 7 2013 1130 AM Neill Blomkamps ""District 9"" used mistreated and segregated extraterrestrials as a metaphor for apartheid in the writer and directors home country of South Africa. It was a smart film and it got an unexpected four Academy Award nominations including one for best picture. Blomkamp is back with ""Elysium"" a movie that is just as political but relies on whatever giant glaring neon sign that exists beyond metaphor to make its points about immigration and universal health care. Its pretty cool to try to work those worthy topics into a science-fiction film but its too bad Blomkamp checked all semblance of subtlety at the door. The movie is set in 2154 when once again humans have pretty much ruined earth. Its polluted overcrowded and impoverished. But the super rich dont have to worry about that. They live on Elysium a space station that floats above earth. Its Stepford perfect clean green beautiful in a sterile way. Each home comes equipped with a machine that cures what ails you from simple aging to cancer. Its the ultimate healthcare solution. But its only available to documented citizens. To those below Elysium with all its riches remains tantalizingly visible but for the vast majority literally and figuratively out of reach. An ice queen named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) a kind of secretary of defense makes sure it stays that way resorting to violence to keep out those who try to enter illegally. All that obvious enough for you? Max (Matt Damon) has always dreamed of going to Elysium. He grew up in an orphanage with Frey (Alice Braga) and promised her that one day he would take her there. Grown-up life doesnt make that promising. Max is an ex-con living in the squalor of LA working in a factory that makes the robotic cops that menace him from time to time. By chance he runs across Frey working as a nurse in an overcrowded hospital. She has a daughter (Emma Tremblay) who suffers from leukemia. Shes too busy and probably too smart to make much time with him. Then one day an accident at the factory makes Maxs dreams of Elysium more urgent. He pleads with Spider (Wagner Moura) who tries to smuggle people onto the space station. Sure thing Spider tells Max. All you have to do is jack into the brain of John Carlyle the owner of the factory (William Fichtner) and get the information thats stored there. This will require an exoskeletonlike contraption a gizmo drilled into Maxs brain and the avoidance of a psycho named Kruger (Sharlto Copley) fired from government employ but hired back on the sly by Delacourt for reasons that will become clear. Suffice it to say that the information in Carlyles brain could change the balance of power on earth and Elysium. Like so many summer movies the somewhat intriguing set-up devolves into shoot-em-up shenanigans at some point (albeit a shoot-em-up with cool futuristic weapons). Which would be OK if the acting was any better. Damon is fine as the flawed hero his jaw set squarely but his heart open to change. Moura is interesting as the wheeling dealing Spider. But Copley is ridiculously over the top as Kruger spewing every bad-guy cliche in the villain handbook in a thick South African accent. Most surprising and disappointing is the usually reliable Foster. Shes terrible. She makes Delacourt a joke which doesnt seem to be the intention a parody of a cold calculating woman. After her first fit of anger or two its impossible to take her antics seriously. Where did this come from? Who knows but it doesnt help ""Elysium"" over the hump. Kudos to Blomkamp for not shying away from social issues in his films but here the execution doesnt live to the intentions. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Matt Damon in scowly meat-and-potatoes mode plays an ex-con factory worker who has to get to the healing med-pods of Elysium before he dies of radiation poisoning. South African director Neill Blomkamp made a splash in 2009 with ""District 9"" and this is his Hollywood reward An expertly-made slice of future shock that breaks no new ground whatsoever.

But it doesnt fully realize its fascinating premise or live up to the promise established by Blomkamps riveting last film 2009s District 9.Set in 2154 after an apocalyptic event humanity is divided along the lines of haves and have-nots. The 1 percenters live on Elysium a sparkling perfectly manicured orbiting space station modeled after the worlds most luxurious havens. The masses eke out an existence on a ruined teeming polluted Earth. Horrible poverty rampant crime and widespread sickness prevail. In contrast Elysium denizens all have sumptuous homes equipped with state-of-the-art healing pods in which people are re-atomized and cured of all injuries and infirmities.VIDEO Damons Elysium mixes politics with sci-fiREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersEmigration is impossible as enforced by Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) a power-mad head in a helmet of lacquered blond hair.The only person who can level the disparities between the two worlds is the not-so-mad Max (Matt Damon) an Earth dweller who lives in a vast bombed-out slum formerly known as Los Angeles. On the job at a prison-like factory Max suffers a life-threatening injury that impels him to risk all and get to Elysium. He takes on a perilous mission in which he goes up against the ruthless Delacourt and Kruger (Sharlto Copley) a sadistic mercenary.Miraculously Max retains a sense of humor and human decency even though his existence could not be grimmer. Damon is perfectly cast as Max. Ever likable hes terrific as a reluctant hero driven by despair and inherent goodness. Many of the people he lives among are Spanish speakers and Damon is convincingly bilingual. In contrast those living on Elysium speak French. Such subtleties are wonderfully intelligent touches.Max re-connects with his childhood best friend Frey (Alice Braga) a nurse at an impoverished hospital and the mother of a critically ill young girl.Bound for Elysium Max is fused with a metal casing that turns him into a kind of walking computer. Hes joined on the mission by good pal Julio soulfully played by Diego Luna. Their passage has been arranged by Spider (Wagner Moura) the leader of an underground rebel group. Max has struck a perilous bargain with Spider. Before boarding the flight he must download crucial information from the brain of a multimillionaire CEO (William Fichtner).District 9 was captivating from start to finish. Elysium is a sporadically engaging tale as well as a potent commentary on immigration and health care policies. The striking production design by Philip Ivey who has re-imagined Earth as one massive shantytown is vividly immersive.There is however a missing component Delacourt and President Patel (Faran Tahir) are the only Elysium residents given names. But they like everyone else there are essentially cardboard cutouts. Foster plays Delacourt in one megalomaniacal note. Even some sympathetic Earth residents are not multi-dimensional. A sense of fully drawn contrasting lives (not just lifestyles) would have improved a compelling concept.Blomkamp knows how to create scenarios that seem frighteningly plausible. With all its promise and smarts its a shame that the film ultimately degenerates into a good-guy-vs.-crazed-villain scenario.Elysium is a good movie that could have been great had it focused more on character development and class warfare subtleties and less on standard-issue firefights. 169 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1estQS7Summer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

The surgically attached machinery serves several functions at once. Its there to make Max strong -- a boost he critically needs since hes been exposed to a dose of radiation that will leave him dead in just five days. It also allows him to download the contents of someone elses brain. But the most important purpose served by that added hardware may be visual and symbolic It transforms Max into a hulkingly damaged yet superheroic man-machine -- a variation on the title character of RoboCop. And it has the unmistakable look of a cross that hes been nailed to. Max isnt just fighting to save himself or his fellow earthlings. Hes a guy whos been souped up into a postapocalyptic action-movie Christ. Elysium confirms the talent -- for razory mayhem and shocking satire for the crazed spectacle of future decay -- that Blomkamp showcased in his amazing first feature District 9 (2009). Ive never forgotten that films images of gargantuan alien spaceships hovering in the air or of droid wars as bloody and frenzied as a heavy-metal version of the Crusades. In Elysium Blomkamp comes up with sci-fi conceits that sear themselves into your imagination. The film is set in 2154 and much of it takes place in a crumbling shantytown Los Angeles that suggests the concrete ghettos of Rio-meet-Blade Runner with the sun up and the lights turned off. Earth has become a great big slovenly police state with citizens kept in check by clanging robot officers programmed to presume that youre guilty. Max a former car thief who now works on an assembly line (thats where he gets zapped with radiation) is hauled before his parole officer who turns out to be an old carnival mannequin that speaks like a voicemail menu and says things like ""Stop talking"" Suspended above this hellhole society is a twirling man-made satellite called Elysium where the elite live. From a distance (it can be glimpsed in the noon sky) Elysium looks like the steering wheel of a 60s Chrysler. Up close we can see that the vast metal rim contains a sprawling prefab suburban paradise -- acres and acres of pristine lawns and McMansions. The people who live there have all they want yet Blomkamps sly joke is that even the world that everyone on Earth covets is a paper-thin and almost virtual place. The key advantage of living on Elysium is that each home is equipped with a healing chamber that will cure everything from flesh wounds to cancer in five seconds. Thats why Max joining forces with his old underworld cronies will do anything to get there Its the only way his irradiated body can survive. Elysium takes off from a pure existential thriller situation (which it borrows from the great 1950 film noir D.O.A.) and its been shot in an incredibly effective mode of raggedy quick-cut anxiety. Yet apart from that health care allegory (and the 1 percent-versus-99 percent theme it emerges from) the plot is fairly basic. I wish that the film had more of the tasty futuristic detail promised by that dummy parole officer. I also wish that Blomkamp took us deeper into the world of Elysium. Max has to outwit the fascist politician whos plotting to take over (shes played by Jodie Foster with angry clipped diction and not a lot more). But once hes up there Elysium turns into a virtuoso gun battle that might be taking place almost anywhere. What makes it matter is Damon who has kicked ass before but never with this kind of underlying brotherhood-of-man melancholy.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Elysium Recommended Video Rated R  109 minutes  2013 Remarkably up-front about its radical politics this sci-fi action movie by writer-director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) uses a dystopic future U.S. to express outrage about a range of contemporary injustices from Obamas drone strikes to the erosion of workers rights. In Blomkamps vision of the 22nd century financial elites have abandoned earth--which has become so polluted and overpopulated that civilization hangs in jeopardy--and created a privatized society on the title space station. Matt Damon plays an ex-convict from Los Angeles (a richly imagined urban hell combining aspects of present-day Mexico City Johannesburg and Rio de Janeiro) who ends up disrupting the whole system. The visual style evokes numerous bone-crushing blockbusters of recent years (Black Hawk Down in particular) but part of what makes this so invigorating is the way it turns the genre on its head critiquing military might and voicing sympathy for the disenfranchised.

Kimberley French/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/Sony Pictures Jody Foster plays her political opposite as the brutal secretary of defense in Elysium. Kimberley French/Sony Pictures Elysium Director Neill Blomkamp Genre Action drama sci-fi Running Time 109 minutes Rated R for strong bloody violence and language throughout With Jodie Foster Matt Damon Sharlto Copley Diego Luna Elysium begins with a good angry satirical premise Its the year 2154 and Earth has been polluted to the point where the rich have decamped for a humongous ring-shaped super-space-station in orbit -- a paradise of manicured lawns swimming pools robot servants and even machines that cure cancer in like 15 seconds. Its called Elysium and down below the poor in their dirty slums gaze on it like the brass ring on an old merry-go-round. But its hard for them to immigrate. Elysiums defense secretary welcomes the undocumented with guided missiles. YouTube The writer-director is 33-year-old South African Neill Blomkamp who in his Oscar-nominated sci-fi action picture District 9 re-imagined apartheid with giant shrimp from outer space. Theres nothing as audacious in Elysium but then this is a studio film with major stars. Matt Damon plays Max a luckless parolee who once had big dreams but has since been beaten down. He wants only to keep his dangerous factory job and stay out of trouble. The problem is that he has a way of mouthing off to authority figures -- especially a cheap-looking robotic dummy that wont let him speak. If the rest of Elysium were like that it would be golden. But Blomkamp uses his ripe conceit and twisty stylish state-of-the-art techniques in the service of a plot more suited to 19th-century melodrama. YouTube Jodie Foster plays that defense secretary the sort of person who orders spaceships bearing families destroyed in defiance of a president who tells her just to send them back to Earth. So she plots to take him out by getting a robotics mogul (William Fichtner) to shut down and reboot Elysium which would make her president. It sounds ridiculous to me too but then nothing about Fosters performance makes sense. Her accent is either English South African or Martian -- its hard to tell since its different in every scene -- and she moves more stiffly than the robots. With this performance Foster joins the ranks of outspokenly liberal actors who cant manage to play their political opposites. Damon is much better but still not convincing. After Max gets a lethal dose of radiation in a factory he has one motivation -- not to die. That takes precedence over doing good things joining some rebels or even helping the adorably inquisitive cancer-ridden daughter of his childhood companion Frey played by Alice Braga. But Im sorry Damon looks and acts like too much of a sweetie. You can see his moral trajectory from miles away from his crisis of conscience to the face-off against the paramilitary psycho villain played by the star of District 9 Sharlto Copley. Director Blomkamp makes up for the creaky plotting by shooting everything with a hand-held camera thats always supertight on the actors so when Max gets pummeled by fists and lethal objects we get pummeled by light and noise and rock-em-sock-em editing. And the action is thrilling; Elysium revs you up and on its own dumb terms it delivers. But its less fun when Blomkamp blows something up than when he sends it up -- as he does the incorrigible insensitivity of the rich or the absence of empathy in robots programmed to punish the poor for showing impudence. The rest of the movie is lowest-common-denominator stuff. It likewise seems programmed by studio executives who dream of grabbing the brass ring right here right now.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday August 7 2013 132 PM Title Elysium Film Info R Violence. Area theaters. Opens Thursday. About midway through ""Elysium"" Matt Damon has a steel exoskeleton attached to his body. Though its a metaphor in writer-director Neill Blomkamps sci-fi drama the suit represents things exactly when this thoughtful film tips over from too much action. The exoskeleton is attached to working-class hero Max De Costa (Damon) to strengthen him after an industrial accident. Its also required to fight his way into Elysium a space station thats only a 20-minute rocket ride from Earth but impossible for people like Max to reach. The year is 2154. Pollution and disease have ravaged the planet -- Los Angeles is a teeming steaming wasteland -- but the one percent live comfy and cozy and for eternity up in the sky thanks to machines that repair all ailments. Matt Damon and Alice Braga in Elysium Those like Max who have jobs on Earth endure wretched indignities for fear of losing what they have. So Max goes into a dangerous area that fills him with radiation leaving him five days to live. His only hope is to join the illegal immigrants who have fake IDs burned into their skin take an unauthorized trip to Elysium crash into a mansion and use the super-health machine. Jodie Foster plays the protector of the privileged class in Elysium. But Maxs mission is bigger. He has a program uploaded into his head that could reboot Elysiums security system defended by the Elysium presidents chief secretary (Jodie Foster). The steel suit attached to Max by rebel forces dehumanizes him but he has no choice. ""Elysium"" stacks the deck Max also must get the daughter of his childhood sweetheart to the space station to cure her leukemia. The flashbacks we see of a preteen Max and his true love Frey (played as an adult by Alice Braga) are haunting. That back story works as do the macabre scenes that suggest where were going (computerized mannequins replace clerks; a bottle of pills dumped on the fatally ill). Earths urban areas are a polluted ravaged nightmare in Elysium. Damon is sturdy as usual. Max a smart guy whos had a tough life has an everyman decency with just enough burliness to get his point across. Though hes never face-to-face with Foster the two are formidable adversaries. The conniving secretary also has a snarling lackey (Sharlto Copley) on Earth who doesnt care when hes made redundant. He just smashes whom hes told to. But unfortunately ""Elysium"" devolves. It doesnt address the ramifications of making everyone healthy for eternity or what it is on Earth theyre making or digging up that fuels whatever economy is left on the space station. For such a well thought-out premise theres not a mention of how capitalism works in this futureworld. The Elysium space station hovers above Earths horizon. Four years ago Blomkamps immigration parable ""District 9"" was a similar mix of the mental and the muscular nabbing a Best Picture Oscar nod for Best Picture. ""Elysium"" is a heavier lift. Like some of the best sci-fi movies it draws strength from a great idea. Then it settles for crunching battles and predictability. Like Max it loses what made it special.

"Elysium (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Elysium (R) Writer-director Neill Blomkamps follow-up to ""District 9"" is another smart and inventive thrill ride. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiherald.com8/7/2013 Editor rating 3 Elysium the second movie from writer-director Neill Blomkamp isnt quite as inventive or fresh as his knockout debut 2009s District 9. But the new picture is cut from the same cloth -- furiously exciting sci-fi carefully considered and loaded with allegories and social commentary. In his first foray into Hollywood studio filmmaking Blomkamp has stayed true to his artistic instincts while delivering all the flash and pow required by a 100 million budget. This is a mean and dirty little B-movie made with the gloss and scope of a grade-A blockbuster. Like District 9 the central premise is storybook-simple In the year 2154 Earths wealthiest elite have migrated to the eponymous space station a luxurious and pristine utopia leaving the rest of mankind behind on a ruined crime-ridden planet policed by robots where forced labor and slave wages are the norm. One of those factory workers the ex-convict Max (Matt Damon) grew up looking up at Elysium floating in the sky and dreamed of going there someday. But after hes exposed to a lethal dose of radiation on the job and is given five days to live that dream becomes a life-or-death mission The medical pods that can cure him exist only in Elysium. Blomkamp isnt interested in the one percentile that literally floats above the lower class. With the exception of Elysiums power-hungry secretary of defense (Jodie Foster) who ruthlessly shoots down shuttles carrying illegal immigrants trying to flee Earth the rest of the space stations inhabitants are faceless extras lurking in the background. The supposedly idyllic paradise too is rendered as an opulent playground of extravagant wealth elegance and terminal boredom a never-ending series of dull cocktail and dinner parties hosted by bland impeccably mannered billionaires. If this is the good life Id take my chances on Earth any day. At least things are exciting there. Elysium would have been a better more complex film if Blomkamp hadnt used such broad strokes in his depiction of the upper class (even Foster cant do much but glare and give off villainous vibes). But there isnt much time in this lean fast-paced picture to focus on anything outside of Maxs desperate quest which is made more difficult by an unhinged government agent (District 9s Sharlto Copley) in relentless pursuit. The plot of Elysium becomes tangled but its never confusing allowing Blomkamp to stage one suspenseful cliffhanger after another. There are some effective twists too including a tremendously staged setpiece involving a live grenade that takes you by surprise. Arriving at the tail end of a mostly disappointing summer movie season this is popcorn entertainment of the highest order. Damon is so likable and charismatic as Max that you always root for the character even when he makes morally questionable decisions. The visuals and effects in Elysium are state-of-the-art -- the movie looks fantastic -- and although Blomkamp isnt subtle with his subtexts of class differences racism and the importance of universal health care he does leave them open to interpretation. Elysium could be read as either pro or con on opening borders for immigrants ""Look at the good that comes when you help the downtrodden"" or ""Well there goes the neighborhood"" Cast Matt Damon Jodie Foster Sharlto Copley Alice Braga Diego Luna Wagner Moura William Fichtner. Writer-director Neill Blomkamp. Producers Bill Block Neill Blomkamp Simon Kinberg. A TriStar Pictures release. Running time 109 minutes. Vulgar language strong violence gore.

"Review Elysium might disappoint fans of District 9 - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Elysium might disappoint fans of District 9By Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 08/06/2013 121932 PM PDTUpdated 08/07/2013 045637 PM PDT PHOTO GALLERY gt; View more images in this slideshow | Mercury News Media Center Four years ago first-time director Neill Blomkamp put a spin on a basic sci-fi conceit and turned it into a parable about apartheid in his native South Africa. A low-budget indie film ""District 9"" was not only a surprise box-office hit but it also earned an Oscar nomination for best motion picture.Now Blomkamp is back with his second film and once again he has turned a classic bit of sci-fi business (the dystopia with a simmering undercurrent of class conflict) into an allegory through which to comment on modern politics and social failings. But ""Elysium"" has a much bigger budget and big-name stars and was made under the studio system -- which may not have worked out for the best. It is not as razor-sharp or as wonderfully surprising as ""District 9"" although it can hardly be called a complete failure. A disappointment perhaps but not a failure.In ""Elysium"" its 2154 and Los Angeles -- all of Earth for that matter -- is not the kind of place youd want to live. The City of Angels is a city of hell a sprawling polluted overpopulated slum far worse than modern-day Sao Paulo or Mexico City (where the movie was filmed). Theres precious little work less food and even less medical care.The rich and powerful? Oh they have split for a sleek futuristic space station where they live the good life and keep the riffraff on the planet below at bay. The station Elysium is only 19 minutes from Earth by shuttle but for the huddled masses it might as well be at the edge of the universe.Advertisement This kind of haves vs. have-nots future has been a staple of cinematic science fiction since Fritz Langs ""Metropolis"" in 1927. But Blomkamp makes it a truly angry commentary on the arrogance of the 1 percent restrictive immigration policies and the lack of universal health care.About the only real work in the Los Angeles of ""Elysium"" is at the factories of the Armadyne corporation which developed the space station and all the technology that runs and protects it. Elysium is overseen by a slimy CEO named Carlyle (William Fichtner). One of Armadynes workers is Max (Matt Damon) a former car thief whose dream is to one day buy a ticket to the paradise in the sky. But his life is completely altered when he is hit with a lethal dose of radiation at work giving him only five days to live. His only hope is to get to Elysium where any illness or injury can be cured in seconds.For that he needs the help of Spider (Brazilian actor Wagner Moura) a closet revolutionary who tries to sneak ""illegals"" from Earth onto the space station. Spider has a plan that involves turning Max into a walking computer giving him a powerful exoskeleton suit of armor and sending him off to kidnap Carlyle. That doesnt work out as planned but Max does end up with a download of critical technological data that could topple the government on Elysium.Delacourt (Jodie Foster) -- the Elysium official charged with security -- is not pleased and unleashes her top agent the mercenary Kruger (Sharlto Copley from ""District 9"") on Max and two innocents hes picked up along the way his childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) and her young daughter who is dying of cancer.For about two-thirds of ""Elysium"" Blomkamp seems completely in charge of his material with striking representations of both the grim Los Angeles of the future and the space station great use of special effects and potent takes on modern-day issues. But then his storytelling fails him and what had been an absorbing thriller devolves into a standard issue slugfest between Max and Kruger. More important the internal logic of the film seems to vanish to the point where Blomkamp never quite explains how access to Elysium will be salvation for the millions trapped on Earth.Damon as good as he is never fully clicks as Max. Foster has an interesting character in Delacourt but she eventually is pushed into a secondary role to Kruger. Copley is quite good as the killer even with a thick South African accent that makes his dialogue almost intelligible at times. You wish though that Blomkamp had made Kruger more multidimensional. At times there are hints that Kruger is as much a victim of the Elysium oppression as Max but its never developed.In fact that may be the biggest problem with ""Elysium."" You never really get a sense of the people who populate the film -- whether they live on Earth or on the space station. In a more fully developed film there would be shades of gray to this class conflict rather than the black and white Blomkamp brings to his piece. Matt Damon stars in Elysium. (Kimberley French/TriStar Pictures) Still for all its flaws ""Elysium"" is an often-absorbing and largely entertaining film from a young director with a great future. That makes it worth seeing -- if not a complete success.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.ELYSIUM   1/2Rating R (for violence and language) Cast Matt Damon Jodie Foster Sharlto Copley and Alice BragaDirector Neill BlomkampRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Next to superhero movies dystopic parables have become the big-budget genre du jour both playing off both our collective anxieties over the here and now (if things dont stop declining rapidly then...) and giving us a safe space to exorcise them (see things could be so much worse). ""Unless man quickly learns to control the rate of change in society at large"" Alvin Toffler wrote in his 1970 the-sky-has-already-fallen study Future Shock ""we are doomed to a massive adaptational breakdown."" The point of controlling the plummet is long past so these what-if stories offer us a sneak-preview stare into our potential abyss. Or as another wise man said ""We are all interested in the future for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives"" Hollywood loves these apocalypse-soon stories however because they function as blank canvases for ruin porn and if nothing else Neill Blomkamps Elysium gives us the realistically trashed tomorrow we suspect we deserve. The year is 2154 our big blue marble is wrecked and the City of Angels is now a Third World proletariat village of the damned. (The exteriors were filmed in an impoverished area of Mexico City recasting our nations entertainment capital as a contemporary everyslum. Keep eating yourself Los Angeles) Legitimate work can be found primarily in prisonlike superfactories that would make Foxconn Technology drool with envy but most folks make their living in less-than-legal ways. Ominous-looking robots employ a populace-wide stop-and-frisk policy. Forget Matt Damon the films A-list lead; the real star of this sci-fi bleakbuster is Philip Iveys production design which builds on the same shantytown-on-steroids look he and Blomkamp employed for their previous hit District 9 (2009). Still you cant make a movie like this without a narrative and a Christ figure which is where Damons Max comes in. A former foster kid with a checkered past this poor grunt just wants to put in time at his blue-collar job and keep his head down maybe take his now-grown childhood sweetheart (Alice Braga) on a date. An accident leaves him with a lethal dose of radiation and five days to live. His only hope is to get an interstellar coyote to ferry him to the Promised Land 2.0 Elysium the squeaky-clean rotating space paradise that houses the 1 percent and has a ""re-atomizer"" cure-all machine in every home. Maxs ex-associate can get him there provided he hijack some ""brain data"" from a visiting corporate CEO (William Fichtner)--who is smuggling plans in his noggin that will allow Elysiums one-woman NSA (Jodie Foster) to stage a coup. The stage is set for heavy-artillery firefights high-speed chases in Road Warrior-ish cars heist thrills and once Max has a rusty metal exoskeleton grafted onto his body some mano a mano supercyborg combat. (If Damons character is terminally sick from radiation poisoning you ask how could he survive such an invasive surgery? Oh you and your pesky questions the film replies giving you a noogie and sending you on your way.) This is where Blomkamps signature Pentium-chip punk aesthetic starts to pay off in spades. He specializes in tactile sci-fi and as in District 9 theres a thrillingly palpable sense that somehow youre watching actual third-generation hardware being used to splatteriffic effect instead of so many weightless 1s and Os. Though he may cobble his futurescape from various spare parts--good luck in not humming Strausss Blue Danube waltz during the films gliding wide shots of its satellite Eden or thinking of Blade Runner during the random-fire L.A. horizon shots--what he puts together from the detritus like his characters weaponry and makeshift dwellings feels both familiar and unique. Once Max and the South African mercenary (Sharlto Copley) pursuing him take their fight to the wheel in the sky that keeps on turnin however the familiar aspects--as well as the already heavy-handed metaphors--start to outweigh the sui generis. Having Earth denizens mostly speak Spanish and Elysium inhabitants speak French is a nice touch but giving Foster a blue-blood accent suggests she hails from the planet Central Casting. Ditto Copleys bad guy who ends up being just another graduate of the mustache-twirling school of sadistic villainy and the climactic knock-down-drag-out might have been lifted from any action film of the previous dozen summers. Just because youve constructed a plausible 22nd-century shitshow of social breakdown and class warfare doesnt mean you can skate by with 19th-century plot tricks especially since the market is now so flooded with dystopias that were on the verge of entering the Age of Apocalypse-Flick Fatigue. Elysium may point with a singularly pulpy brio toward where we could be headed. But in terms of how its fictional heroes try to transcend such brave new worlds its not showing us a future we havent seen a million times before.

The movie characterizes two types of people. First those are on the earth poor and helpless. And second those who are living out of the planet earth in a self-made paradise called Elysium. A Roman Catholic nun has been showed raising up young Max who is orphan and poor. He wishes to see Elysium. It is quite similar to the Church and its ministries in the developing world that is engaged in preaching the good news of the Kingdom of God and providing hope to the poor and oppressed that a day will come when justice peace and stability will rule the creation. The movie reveals the lifestyles and privileges of the people of Elysium who have gained it by the sheer hard work of people like Max. Many have argued that many wealthy countries of the world enjoy many luxuries on the cost of the progressing world and their inhabitants. Many Western businesses have their production projects in the developing countries. People of poor countries prepare products for the style and luxury of people of the wealthy countries on very low cost. These companies do not care for their employees as they would have cared for them in their own countries. Most of the times these laborers reflect Max who got affected by getting exposed to lethal level of radiation at his job that led him to die in five days. Though Max had limited time he with the help of Spider the computer guy showed up as a messiah for the people of earth. He liberated them from the bondage of oppression and made them equal citizens of Elysium. To make this happen Max had to fight against Jessica Delacourt a high ranking official and a member of the governmental council. She had her people in field whose job was to keep an eye on the uprising movements of people of the earth and if required confront them. Kruger was the main bad guy among her force. The role of Jessica and Kruger is pretty similar to the function of intelligence agencies and their agents in the world especially in the developing countries. The plot discloses Frey who by profession is a medical nurse and a childhood friend of Max. Frey has a little daughter Matilda who is dying of leukemia. She needs a medical treatment that is not available on the earth. Matilda becomes a reason of Maxs call to the cause encouraging him to go to Elysium to fight against imperialism. On the other hand Kruger kills his boss Jessica and takes over the charge of Elysium. Max fights Kruger and overcomes all his power by providing freedom and equal privileges to all people of the earth. Though Max dies while redeeming people of the earth it provided them with salvation from their oppression struggles and sufferings of various kinds. The movie is a reminder about parts of the world that are suffering and are in need of Max who had a heart for justice and equal privileges for all humankind. The nun who raised him may have taught him about the gospel of Jesus Christ and what it means to be a follower of Jesus. Today the question is how many followers of Jesus believe in the equal rights and privileges of the humankind? How many oppose the wrong distribution of power wealth and opportunities? How many are like Max and Spider and not like Jessica and Kruger FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 7 2013ianFeaturedNow you know why michael douglas tried to sue him in court - http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk9pr-F7MoMFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/elysium-movie-review,200,elysium41,elysium,timeout

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the bleak dystopian future of Elysium mankind has been cleanly segregated by altitude. While most of the population still lives on the surface of the planet now a crime-infested and pollution-choked hellhole the fabulously wealthy have retreated to space-station paradise Elysium--a kind of orbiting gated community where the 1 percent enjoys access to magical ""medpods"" that instantly mend broken bones and clear cancer-ridden bodies of disease. Though that might sound suspiciously similar to the plot of this springs dual-gravity fable Upside Down its actually the new brainchild of District 9 director Neill Blomkamp who apparently never met a metaphorical high concept he couldnt reduce to genre-flick window dressing. As allegory Elysium is less risible than its predecessor in that it doesnt equate apartheid victims to slimy space bugs. But its ultimately even less concerned with the social issues it pretends to tackle; any focus on wealth inequality or the failures of the health-care system basically evaporates once the heavy artillery comes out. Much of Elysium is set in 22nd-century Los Angeles envisioned--like the alien-imprisoning Johannesburg of District 9--as a crumbling urban wasteland above which floats an enormous hunk of machinery. Here in a shamelessly maudlin flashback an impoverished urchin reaches skyward toward the ozone utopia hes too poor to live in. Jump forward a couple decades and the boy is now a weary tattooed ex-convict (Matt Damon in man-of-action Bourne mode) raging impotently against the machine and trying to win back the childhood sweetheart (Alice Braga) he once promised to take to Elysium. Theres an element of almost-potent satire to these early scenes which present a world where sticking it to the little guy is now completely automated. (In the films funniest scene Damon tries in vain to reason with his robotic parole officer a clunky-looking contraption that offers him pills to quell his distress.) Blomkamp remains a gifted inventor of environments; theres a lived-in quality to his slummed-out L.A. evident in technology that seems at once futuristic and outdated like the rustic hardware of the Alien franchise. Elysium is in other words a triumph of art-direction but not of storytelling Its backdrop established and its midpoint arrived at the film quickly devolves into another hyper-violent chase picture--a slicker more expensive remake of the all-action all-the-time second half of District 9. Desperate to reach Elysium--where the medpods can heal the effects of the lethal radiation poisoning he receives during a freak accident--Damon allows underworld doctors to graft an exoskeleton onto his frail frame. Soon hes caught in the middle of an information war between upwardly mobile gangsters and Elysiums secretary of defense (Jodie Foster trying out a ludicrous accent) with his brain serving as a storage space for some vital intel. The action a series of chaotic gunfights set to the Inception-like sonic boom of Ryan Amons score is visceral and robust. But its also kind of numbing. Unlike Terminator 2--another sci-fi shoot-em-up that begins in Los Angeles and to which Elysium is clearly indebted--the movie never varies the nature of its run-and-gun spectacle. Appealing though he usually is as an action hero Damon doesnt have much to do here but scowl and look cool brandishing giant weapons. Driven solely by self-preservation his hero eventually gets invested in the fate of Bragas sickly daughter; like Bogie in Casablanca--which also involved sought-after tickets to a better world--Damon decides to stick his neck out for someone. Yet the change is so sudden and the protagonist by that point such an inhuman force of nature that the dramatic arc feels negligible. It doesnt help that all the other characters are stick figures Braga basically embodies the saintly perseverance of the lower class while the villains are either dimestore sociopaths (Sharlto Copleys vicious mercenary) or boo-and-hiss-worthy millionaires (William Fichtners heartless industrialist). Elysium feeds off of lingering traces of Occupy outrage but its fantasy rewiring of the rigged financial system hinges on a technological MacGuffin not an actual transformation of society. Blomkamps interests clearly lie elsewhere with big guns and bigger spacecrafts--a reminder that District 9 which announced his arrival as a purveyor of ""intelligent"" sci-fi grew from the ashes of a Halo movie. With Elysium the director proves that he still has one hand on the X-Box controller; maybe he should give the allegories a rest already and just get back in the game.

Photo AP In ""Elysium"" after the Earth has turned into a ravaged wasteland in 2154 the bad/rich guys live on a space station that hovers enticingly in the sky like a moon. Our proletarian heroes stuck in a parched LA gaze heavenward shake their fists and even send spaceships buzzing at the orbiting Elysians. But not because the plebs want to destroy it No they want to move in. For a 99 percenter movie then ""Elysium"" is kind of a head-scratcher. It throws away its best opportunity for drama. Its as if Han and Leia parked on the Death Star and started asking ""How much is a two-bedroom around here?"" But this isnt the first time a movie has strained so hard to issue a topical message -- the poor Latino Earthlings who keep trying to sneak onto the space station are even called ""illegals"" -- that it lost track of basic storytelling imperatives. Putting on his Very Serious face for what ought to be a romp Matt Damon is exactly the wrong choice for a role that 1980s Arnold Schwarzenegger would have played with a twinkle in his eye. The overrated Jodie Foster assumes the role of chief villain in ""Elysium."" (AP) Damon is joyless charmless and hairless as an ex-con who after getting poisoned with radiation decides hes got nothing left to lose by going on a trip to Elysium and asking them if they wouldnt mind giving some health care to the daughter of his childhood friend played by Alice Braga. There is not much of a spark between those two characters another missed opportunity. And heres another Damons Max never really goes mano a mano with the chief villain (Jodie Foster) the evil defense minister of Elysium who is so disgusted with her presidents soft approach to immigrants that shes preparing to bust a coup on his ass. The movies shorthand for heartlessness is this Rhodes (Foster) sips Champagne and speaks French. Foster by the way is embarrassingly bad in the film -- she may be the most overrated actress alive -- and I couldnt tell you what accent she was mangling. Perhaps all of them? RELATED THE HIGH-TECH HORRORSCAPE OF ""ELYSIUM"" IS ALREADY IN THE WORKS The illegals though led by Max have a plan to sneak aboard Elysium. Ready for it? Theyre going to unplug it -- shut off the whole deal -- and while the system is down pull the old switcheroo where you change everyones status from ""illegal"" to ""legal."" These immigration coyotes have a touch of Wile E. to them although that detail is no dumber than the fact that whenever the space station is about to be invaded by Earth ships it calls this one mangy guy (Sharlto Copley) stationed near LA and has him shoot down the illegals with a shoulder-fired rocket. This is the second film from South African director Neill Blomkamp who did ""District 9"" and seems to be running thin on ideas. Again he imagines a dusty diseased shantytown producing a reluctant hero (last time Copley this time Damon) who blasts away at the villains and saves the poor while wearing a discount Iron Man getup (this time a few braces and a skull monitor). I found both movies plodding and stultifying with their steady streams of ker-blammo covering up their slow pace their silly posturing their thin characters and their creaky plot mechanics. Why if you are going to die from radiation poisoning would bolting some armor on your back and arms extend your life indefinitely? Why do the underdogs seem to have better equipment than the plutocrats? (With just a few braces screwed on Damon can tear apart an actual soldier droid.) And why doesnt Damon ever run into fellow rogue 99 percenter Justin Timberlake from ""In Time"" who must be in the neighborhood somewhere? Some of this might be forgivable if anyone could say ""Ive never seen anything like this before."" But no one can. Just a couple of months ago Tom Cruise paid visits to a ruined Earth from his snazzy space station in another weak sci-fi effort prophetically titled ""Oblivion."" Mediocre minds think alike too.

Movie stars shouldnt be subject to the rules of gravity as we mere mortals are. One of the great pleasures of watching actors is to see them move and when yesterdays youngsters start creaking we feel it in our joints. Thats not to say actors cant age gracefully or that they should do whatever it takes to stay looking young. But the wrong role can make a still-youthful actor appear worn out through no fault of his own. Are we really ready to see Matt Damon looking as if hes dying to plop down in the La-Z-Boy? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In Neill Blomkamps dystopian science-fiction fantasy Elysium Damons Max is a tattooed grunt stranded on the Earth of the future a dismal dried-out planet filled with have-nots living short brutish lives. The rich have long ago decamped to their own shiny inhabitable satellite Elysium where plants thrive and people do too thanks to the amazing free healthcare that all citizens receive courtesy of miraculous health-o-matic machines installed in every home. Following a series of unfortunate events--on this future Earth there is no other kind--Max accepts a mission to help his fellow citizens. Among the obstacles in his way are Elysiums super-defensive secretary-of-defense-type Delacourt (Jodie Foster) who makes her entrance in a Jetsons-worthy tailored white dress and a Tilda Swinton haircut looking so sharp you could cut yourself on her flaring nostrils.You dont have to be a bloodhound to smell an allegory shaping up particularly if youve seen writer-director Blomkamps 2009 debut feature District 9 in which members of an extraterrestrial race who have landed on Earth are forced to live in grimy slums while humans get the cushy suburbs. That setup was a metaphor for Apartheid in South Africa where the director was born and it worked well enough. But District 9 was most notable for Blomkamps skill at creating a believable sci-fi world without spending a lot of dough. The movie felt as if against all odds its creator had willed it into being. Film Details Elysium RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time109 More Info Trailer Elysium doesnt have the same brashness. Though the plot specifics are different thematically it looks and feels almost like a sequel made with a lot more money though not with more ingenuity or feeling. The Earth landscape a wasteland of decrepit tower blocks is more elaborate than the garbage-strewn tent cities of District 9 but also far less poetic. (The star of District 9 South African actor Sharlto Copley shows up here as well in a smaller role as a crusty bearded baddie.) And while Blomkamps message is morally stalwart his delivery system sure is a bummer Andrew Niccols similarly themed 2011 In Time was both more stylish and more effective a serious movie that hit its mark without taking itself too seriously.You can see why Damon would be attracted to this material whose politics are in line with his own. Hes a thoughtful performer who only looks like he ought to be a roaring-twenties football player with a cute leather helmet and a sweater emblazoned with his teams initials. We dont think of him as a grand risk-taker maybe because hes so unassuming that hed never present himself as such. But hes daring in stealthy ways In Steven Soderberghs character study Behind the Candelabra he played Liberaces lover Scott Thorson not as a dumb-dumb boy toy but as a half dreamy half practical kid brought down by tortured love. Hes an actor who can tease the nuances out of a stereotype.Just maybe not this one. In Elysium Max the underdog martyr whos going to save the world spends much of the movie harnessed into a jointed metal armature that leaches him of his charm and spirit. (The scene in which his new backbone is surgically applied unrepentant in its ookiness is one of the few times Blomkamp shows any sense of humor.) Damon is as buff as ever maybe even more so--its hard to believe he made the first of his Bourne movies nearly 10 years ago. But watching him lumber through Elysiums bramble of lofty ideals is no damn fun. He gets to turn on the charm in a few brief scenes with Maxs childhood sweetheart (played by Alice Braga). But mostly he radiates a grim world-weariness that just doesnt suit him and its hard to say if the movie sags around the weight of his performance or if hes just working inhumanly hard to hold this heavy-spirited picture aloft.Probably the latter and hes not alone. As Delacourt Foster seems to be sending up her own no-nonsense frostiness--her characters yacht-club mannerisms border on camp and whether thats intentional or not its at least amusing. But Damon has no such escape route. Weighed down by his steampunky apparatus he looks sluggish even when hes on the run. In Elysium not even Matt Damon--cheerful smart principled energetic Matt Damon--can save the world without figuratively stopping every so often to say ""Oy My back"" No matter how hard he works hes a man of inaction.

By Anthony Lane Jodie Foster and Matt Damon in a movie directed by Neill Blomkamp.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka At last a good big film. The legacy of the summer thus far has been jetsam moribund movies that lie there bloated and beached gasping to break even. But here is something angry and alive ""Elysium"" written and directed by Neill Blomkamp and set in the year 2154. The title refers to a space station in the shape of a wheel orbiting just beyond the confines of Earth--less than twenty minutes away by shuttle. Look up and you see it hanging in the sky shiny and unreachable like a second moon or a vast Mercedes-Benz badge a fitting likeness because Elysium is solely for the rich. They dwell in the wheels enormous rim breathing an unfouled atmosphere and sipping drinks beside their private pools. Down below for the rest of mankind the news is glum. Our planet is on the dust heap. Everything is parched and frenzied not least in Los Angeles where Max (Matt Damon) having done time for numerous crimes is going straight; he has a factory job helping to build the clanking hostile robots that serve as the citys cops. After an accident at work he finds himself with radiation sickness and five days to live. At this point most of us would quit but not Max. The casting is spot-on here because something in Damon--in the unsoothable anxiety of his gaze and in the squat wrestlers physique that seems less buffed than primed to explode--suggests an internal drive of high intensity. Projecting not the will to power but a tireless lust to live he remains likable and oddly bashful--a regular guy who happens to belong in extremis. Cagney would approve I reckon though he never forgot how comic such hardihood can be and watching ""Elysium"" he would warn Damon not to lose the smile. All of which means that we root for Max when he takes on a mission impossible. Its a breeze shoot down a shuttle as it bears a wicked billionaire (William Fichtner) from Earth to Elysium; stick a plug into his skull whether he likes it or not; and download the corporate information crucial to the governing of both places that his brain contains. The master of the plan is a jabbering neer-do-well named Spider (Wagner Moura) who has promised Max a trip to Elysium for his pains. Spider and his fellow-renegades want to strike a blow against the vested and sharp-suited interests that reign in paradise. Max wants to go there because of the medical pod that like a toaster comes with every home. Lie inside it for a few seconds and all your sufferings--including radiation poisoning and leukemia--just melt away. One thing the pod will not cure however is boredom which must be the most common affliction among Elysians. Disease-free immortality is theirs but who wants to spend eternity strolling a weedless lawn and picking out sashimi for lunch? From where I was sitting heaven looked like hell or at best like a long weekend in Bel Air and the strangest aspect of Blomkamps film is his almost complete indifference to the place that bears its title. How come we never meet an Elysian family? Why not introduce an unwashed teen-ager who wants to lurk in his room and listen to old Anthrax LPs or a wife so refulgent with good fortune like Catherine Deneuve in ""Belle de Jour"" that she cant wait to nip back to the planet and get nasty with that guy from the tattoo parlor? The truth is that as with Blomkamps previous movie ""District 9"" what stokes the drama is not satirical nicety but political wrath. The mighty should be pulled down from their seats and thats that. The only one of them who is allowed to be a major character is Delacourt (Jodie Foster) the Secretary of Defense with a helmet of white-blond hair and the voice of a strangulated Brit. Foster is not the first actress you would choose to play a bringer of darkness stripped of all moral intelligence and you keep waiting for her to see the light but it never comes to pass. Has Blomkamp maintained the promise and the threat of ""District 9""? Not quite. He remains more gripped by setup than by resolution and the third act of ""Elysium"" proceeds by bludgeon and blunder leaving a wounded logic in its wake. Also the earlier movie a fable of violent friction between humans and aliens had the boon of specificity. Set in the directors native Johannesburg it didnt declare itself an allegory of apartheid yet it needled away unmistakably at racial injustice. The look of the new film is no less urgent but the didactic intent feels more basic and as for the revenge of the downtrodden which is meant to be as jubilant as the storming of the Bastille it leaves you seriously worried about what might ensue think of Robespierre with a ray gun. On the other hand ""Elysium"" does have Sharlto Copley a friend of Blomkamps who took the leading role in ""District 9"" and who shows up here as an undercover agent answering to Delacourt. His devotion to duty--or to sadism--is such that even a grenade blast in his face counts as no more than a hiccup. At moments like that the movie can be hard to watch though it also finds an unexpected beauty in scenes of entropy and destruction. When Max blows apart an aggressive robot everything slips into slow motion calm and hushed and with a flicker of pity in our amazement we see the machine bloom into a thousand fragments like the bursting TV set at the end of Antonionis ""Zabriskie Point."" I have had my fill of bloodshed many times over in recent months; could metalshed point a way ahead? In short this movie has muscle. So does its hero who bulks up yet further by donning an exo-suit a skeletal casing that is drilled onto his spine and limbs to lend them additional crunch. We saw something comparable in ""District 9"" and the harsh fusion of mortal and mechanical seems to crystallize Blomkamps approach. Such is the force and the impatience of his telling--on the earthly level at any rate--that we dont have time to lean back and ruminate on the wizardish feats of C.G.I. or even to treat the story as science fiction. Rather it hits you as fact; the directors fiercest gift is not to invent the future as a plausible dream but to report on it as if it already existed. We are right there rocked by the incessant babel of languages or watching Max line up to plead with his parole officer who turns out to be a badly painted animatronic doll like the grinning cabbie who ferried Schwarzenegger around in ""Total Recall."" An exasperated Max is offered a pill for his rising heartbeat and asked ""Would you like to talk to a human?"" Sweatier still is his dash down a crowded L.A. street with an enemy craft cruising overhead like the angel of death. As he seeks refuge beneath a truckload of pigs you realize what ""Elysium"" has that films like ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and ""Man of Steel"" refuse to countenance. It doesnt just look and sound right. It smells. There are actors who can put the fear of God into you even when--especially when--they appear to do nothing. You feel them like thunder in the air. They tend to be bulls rather than beanpoles with Clint Eastwood as the honored exception. Brando heads the field of course with Edward G. Robinson trailing by a thick neck. Some contenders whether through a lack of options or the well-earned wish to unwind let their energy slip--who goes to a new De Niro movie with that old twinge of utter foreboding? The prime frightener these days is Niels Arestrup. The name is Danish but he works in French. He is sixty-four in the autumn of a long career; in the nineteen-seventies he was directed by Alain Resnais Chantal Akerman and Claude Lelouch. Only recently though in ""The Beat My Heart Skipped"" and as the gangland boss in ""A Prophet"" has he exposed a wider audience to the brunt of his authority. Steven Spielberg who still has the clearest eye for casting in Hollywood used him in ""War Horse."" Arestrup is stocky and white-haired and sometimes you have to crane forward to catch what he is saying. He scares me out of my wits. In Joachim Lafosses ""Our Children"" Arestrup plays Dr. Pinget who adopted a young Moroccan named Mounir (Tahar Rahim). Now Mounir wants to marry Murielle (Emilie Dequenne) and the doctor wants to help. So close is he to Mounir and so financially generous that he invites Murielle to move in and then goes on honeymoon with the happy couple. As Murielle and Mounir start a family (they eventually have four children) so the tensions in the household increase. If the final release of that pressure seems harrowing beyond all reason bear in mind that Lafosse based his film on a real case that occurred in Belgium in 2007. There is no whodunit here--the horror is plain in the opening shots--and the how is presented with great restraint but the why remains veiled and mysterious long after the film has ended. Dequenne with her heart-shaped face gives all too convincing an impression of a caved-in soul. Some viewers have read ""Our Children"" as a parable of colonialism Pinget controls and corrupts even in his efforts to assist plundering the sanity of his subjects. That sounds extreme but with Arestrup at full strength it makes sense. One man can be an occupying power.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

With a range of pricey flops streaming out of the studios seemingly foolproof products now take on the dimensions of easy targets. With so many better alternatives its hard not to get into the shooting gallery spirit. I have done as much by suggesting that the bloated ""Man of Steel"" made every other Superman movie look like an indie that the original premise of ""Pacific Rim"" was corrupted by loud and empty qualities that turned it into a ""different kind of dumb"" and that the solid but largely unmemorable ""The Wolverine"" with its fugitive protagonist provided a metaphor for franchises forced against better judgement for another go-around. I didnt bother jabbing at ""The Lone Ranger"" R.I.P.D."" or ""After Earth"" but plenty of others did. However this weeks release of Neil Blomkamps ""Elysium"" changes the tenor of the conversation. An original visionary science fiction narrative rated R weighted with heavy conceits about class struggle and technocratic extremes Blomkamps brainy dystopic follow-up to the runaway success ""District 9"" comes nowhere near the satisfying heights of that endearing 30 million treat. Yet ""Elysium"" cost somewhere between three and six times as much as ""District 9"" (depending on how much you figure in the marketing budget) and looks like it. Blomkamps near-future parable in which Earths wealthiest inhabitants have fled to a posh colony orbiting the planet while the lower classes fester in the wreckage below is the best looking movie of its type since ""Avatar."" Like that phenomenon even as it deals with dark themes in somewhat heavy-handed fashion ""Elysium"" counteracts the transparent message with an impressive amount of gravitas. And so the ubiquitous special effects which fill the screen from the first image to the last contain a satisfactory degree of calculation. The biggest disappointments with ""Elysium"" are familiar ones. Matt Damon playing an Earthbound factory working fighting to make his way up to the colony and obtain pricey medical help before a work-related injury can kill him delivers a fairly credible turn -- but Jodie Foster as the icy overseer of Elysiums exclusive community has been largely wasted. Sharlto Copley as the chief villain seeking to stop Damon in his path lacks much in terms of novelty. The plot while loaded with futuristic details and a post-apocalyptic landscape not too dissimilar from ""District 9"" suffers from all-too-common third act issues in which a lot of fists fly and things explode as a bland means of obtaining resolution. Compared to the apparent industry standard though ""Elysium"" provides far more engaging thrills Unlike the empty space showdowns in ""Man of Steel"" Blomkamp offers genuinely thrilling aerial battles that include the gripping application of a grenade in short range moments before a crash landing marking one of the more exciting set pieces to take place in a virtual world. Unlike ""Pacific Rim"" the clashes between man and beast are easier to follow and more fluidly engaging In this case a cyborg-enhanced Damon -- equipped with a grotesque exoskeleton slovenly applied to his body by underworld thugs to assist him in a for-hire task to steal information from a high ranking official (William Fichtner) -- engages mano-a-mano with a defensive robot. And while ""Lone Ranger"" attempted to address the persecution of the American Indian within the constraints of its cartoonish plot ""Elysium"" takes its dark vision of a hierarchical future dead seriously co-opting the sleek imagery of believable space ships and other gadgetry for the sake of a global rant against the privileged nature of expensive technology. Of course that in itself serves as a wry indictment of the blockbuster process. But does ""Elysium"" and by extension a thoughtful polemically driven filmmaker like Blomkamp belong in Hollywood? Thats a difficult question the movie fails to resolve. Under the severe demands of commercial filmmaking personal authorship and complicated argumentation tend to fall by the wayside. Blomkamp has made ""Elysium"" about as edgy as it can get without sacrificing the requisite assemblage of explosions and gunplay that eventually subsume the movie. But these ingredients are distinctly out of sync with the message so that when the ideologically enhanced finale arrives it emerges rather clumsily out of the wreckage of simulated effects. If ""Elysium"" is the brainiest Hollywood movie of the summer its also the most conflicted one. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony releases ""Elysium"" nationwide on Friday. It should perform solid business due to star power and appealing genre ingredients as well as a weak box office and it should have legs throughout Augusts relatively weak mainstream release calendar.

Way too much gratuitous violence particularly at the end. The repeated flashbacks to childhood were corny and overdone. And why was the hero seemingly the last white guy left on the planet? The special effects were nice but not enough. Reply longarche May 12 2016 133 pm William Gibson deserves royalties from the sound of it. Neuromancer anyone? Reply Donella May 12 2016 133 pm I think many potential movie viewers are trying to find ways to cope with apocalypse exhaustion... by watching comedies. Reply Jordan May 12 2016 133 pm I wonder sometimes whether these movies that deal with issues that they then must live within (technology and its availability for the haves versus the have nots) are conflicted because we ourselves are conflicted on these topics. It seems to me that the exposition of the conflict isnt the problem its the clarity with which that conflict is exposed that makes some art and some not. I guess Ill have to see it to decide which one this is... thanks for the analysis Eric. Reply Chris May 12 2016 133 pm Ive got my ticket for this Fridays show I agree that the current crop of CGI has created a ""different kind of dumb"" and I also agree (still without having scene it) that Elysium seems to stand quite separately but not just because it uses CGI better or blows up more stuff. I disagree that this is just a better version of Pacific Rim. This is not a superhero flick a Saturday afternoon with the family or a PG-13 action movie. Other than Elysiumas undoubted use of special effects I donat see how it can be compared to any of your aforementioned list. This is s a R-rated sci-fi thriller much more in-tune with Prometheus than Pacific Rim (which I have not and will not see). The darkness and originality of the trailer of Elysium alone suggest a much more interesting storyline dealing with a futuristic reality that it not wholly an impossible future for us instead of killing Godzilla Come on baby donat disappoint me know For more film reviews visit drumgodchris.blogspot.com Reply guy May 12 2016 133 pm Interesting ideas. It a fantasy movie above all. Reply ds May 12 2016 133 pm Good thoughts but DISTRICT 9 had a third act finale that was all combat and explosions too. i like Blomkamp more than most but i dont think he is as masterfukl with story like he is CG. he could use some study on more interesting endings...

Now that South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp has successfully made a name for himself we find ourselves greeted with ""Elysium"" a follow-up with another near-future sci-fi premise still impressive special effects thuddingly simplistic themes a massive budget and some considerable star power for a change. Leading the charge is Matt Damon as Max De Costa an ex-con in 2154 Los Angeles trying to keep his head down and make his way up to Elysium an elite space station that hovers above the earth a fixture that perpetually taunts a downtrodden populace with its promise of staggeringly advanced medical care. Like everyone else in the SoCal slums Max wants a better life for himself; once he receives a lethal exposure to radiation at his Armadyne factory job Max suddenly needs to go there a desperation shared by old flame Frey (Alice Braga) as she cares for her leukemia-stricken daughter. Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) will do anything to protect Elysium from the unwashed masses going so far as to employ sleeper agent Kruger (""D9"" lead Sharlto Copley) on the ground. Max will do anything to defy her though including strapping on a metallic exo-skeleton and committing a heist of sorts against Armadyne head John Carlyle (William Fichtner). What follows is an unexpected big-budget reprise of the Keanu Reeves flop ""Johnny Mnemonic"" with Copleys despicable assassin chasing down a man whose brain literally holds the data necessary to level the playing field between the 99% and the 1%. Until that point Blomkamp echoes ""District 9"" and its convincingly worn-down world of migrants and machines employing an aesthetic of neon and grime of metal and blood that brings to mind Verhoevens ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall."" Even for the sake of violence technology has brought forth newer cooler ways to kill and be killed. When characters cannot die in ""Elysium"" they simply dont even when theyve lost their entire face; when they must die though they do so in exceedingly juicy detail. The gore is striking to be sure but the mayhem that often causes it rarely ever stands out as much as ""District 9s"" climactic gauntlet did. However Blomkamps seemingly limitless imagination in terms of tech finds itself repeatedly and frustratingly grounded by heavy-handed storytelling. Frankly ""Elysium"" is a bit of a liberals wet dream the good guys want accessible healthcare while the bad guys want to do away with undocumented immigrants. Just as Max seeks a literal cure for his problems the coup-minded Delacourt seeks a figurative one with a laughably strident Foster forced to recycle sneering post-9/11 rhetoric before an ungrateful President. (Why Elysiums lone defenses against oncoming ships are then earthbound instead of shooting from space Ill never know.) She gets to employ a French accent Damon freely switches between English and Spanish and Copley -- the only performer out-hamming Foster -- growls threats with the thick Dutch inflection of his homeland. Whats meant to be a melting-pot touch feels like the latest trick of Blomkamps grab bag thrown in alongside countless gadgets and maudlin flashbacks in which a sage nun prophecizes little orphan Maxs eventual acts of heroism. As our own personal Jesus Damon sells all sorts of futuristic fisticuffs and squinty-eyed determination over the course of this ultra-violent cartoon but even he cant save the fact that all this more ultimately feels like a whole lot less.

The watchful eye of writer-director Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"") gives us a groovy kind of doom with the vast majority of mankind struggling to stay alive on a desiccated planet while the .001 percent live it up on Elysium the ultimate gated community -- an orbiting satellite replete with mansions and rolling lawns. Science-fiction is of course often used as a vehicle to tell stories about the here and now disguised as tales of the future -- and lest anyone miss out on Blomkamps thoughts on contemporary immigration and health care ""Elysium"" underlines and italicizes them before going over them again in yellow highlighter. See video Matt Damon Only Has 5 Days Left to Live in Extended Elysium Trailer Blomkamp is a master of creating action out of a grimy quotidian kind of next-gen hi-tech but when it comes to metaphors he prefers the sledgehammer. Ever since his earliest days in an orphanage Max (Matt Damon) has dreamed of fleeing Earth for the glories of Elysium. As an adult hes working an exhausting gig building robots on an assembly line and when an on-the-job accident leads to a lethal dose of radiation hes willing to do anything to get up to the satellite so that he can heal himself with the machines that keep the residents up there young and healthy forever. Early on Blomkamp shows a flotilla of immigrants flying up to Elysium but theyre not looking for jobs -- robots do all the labor -- theyre looking for health care in a healing chamber that resembles that doohickey that performed surgery on Noomi Rapace in ""Prometheus."" See video Matt Damon Discusses His Hulk Suit in Elysium Dedicated to keeping grubby terrestrial outsiders from this interstellar pleasure dome is Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) whos willing to employ all manner of underhanded tricks to keep Elysium pure even if it involves hiring the psychotic Kruger (""District 9s"" Sharlto Copley) as her Earth-bound enforcer. Maxs plan to get to Elysium involves stealing financial data out of the brain of corporate CEO Carlyle (William Fichtner) but Max doesnt realize that Carlyles cranium also happens to contain the codes that could turn Rhodes into Elysiums iron-fisted new ruler thus forcing Rhodes and Kruger to try to capture him at all costs. So basically plot-wise weve got a mix of ""Metropolis"" and ""Pickup on South Street"" but Blomkamp keeps things rousing whether hes outfitting Damon and Copley with exo-skeletons for their inevitable showdown or introducing weapons that make robots explode in cool slo-mo fashion. One of Blomkamps most satisfying choices is too much of a spoiler to discuss but it shows the kind of moxie that too few blockbusters possess. Damons role often seems more physically than emotionally taxing but he plunges into it enthusiastically. We cant help rooting for Max no matter how stacked the cards are against him in this exploitive society. Besides overplaying its subtext the other major flaw of ""Elysium"" is Fosters performance perhaps this accomplished actress most risible work since ""Siesta."" Strutting around in power suits barking at lackeys and doing her best Alexander Haig its like watching a Joan Crawford impersonation delivered in that vexing accent from ""After Earth."" Still as an effects-laden action piece ""Elysium"" delivers the goods. It might not be the thinking mans fill-in-the-blank that some viewers were eagerly anticipating but its a solid adventure that oversells its deeper meanings. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Elysium Film Review 226 AM PDT 8/1/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Vivid visuals and a pointedly political context are let down by conventional action and conceptual limitations in another big-budget Sony disappointment. TWITTER Matt Damon and Jodie Foster star in ""District 9"" director Neill Blomkamps latest politically tinged sci-fi feature about a factory workers attempt to hijack his way onto a space station inhabited by the elite. A politically charged flight of speculative fiction makes an exciting launch only to tailspin into an ungainly crash landing in Elysium. Coming in the wake of After Earth and White House Down this marks Sonys third big-budget disappointment of the summer the problems this time stemming from deflating final-act script problems that one would think could have been easily identified. Like Neill Blomkamps out-of-nowhere sci-fi triumph with District 9 four years back this one puts rugged action and convincing visual effects at the service of a sociologically pointed haves-and-have-nots storyline but when the air goes out of this balloon it goes fast. There will no doubt be partisans but an embrace by the masses will elude it. Blomkamp gets the dystopian juices flowing with images of future sprawling slums and urban ruin that one might initially take to be Mexico City or Sao Paulo but are soon identified as belonging to Los Angeles in 2154. Most of the beleaguered inhabitants seem to speak Spanish and perform menial labor if they do anything at all while good health care is very difficult to come by. PHOTOS 30 Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Films By contrast hovering far above Earth and appearing like a five-spoked wheel in the sky is Elysium an enormous space station where the rich live in a stress-free country-club environment enhanced by marvelous technology that can cure any ailment meaning that life can theoretically go on indefinitely. A kind of United Nations council of international fat cats runs the place and riffraff from the overpopulated and polluted planet visible beneath them is rigorously kept out no matter how many desperate refugees dare the 19-minute dash in makeshift spacecrafts in order to get their illnesses treated. Liberals may embrace the film and conservatives might attack it strictly on the reductive basis of its obvious plea for universal health care. All the same the growing contemporary disparity between the privileged classes and the poor in many parts of the world is plausibly extended for dramatic effect in Blomkamps script which has the wretched Earth dwellers kept in line by robo-cops and where anyone who actually has a job is counted as lucky. Among these is former convict Max (Matt Damon) now holding down a lowly factory gig but maintaining ties with the criminal/revolutionary underworld part of which is devoted to running ""illegals"" up to the spinning celestial orb. Much in the manner of District 9 but without the aliens this early stretch creates a potently physical impression of a dangerous and destitute urban environment one where immediate threats could lurk anywhere and a sense of ones physical and societal inferiority can never be escaped; all one has to do is look up. With all this Blomkamp sets several narrative pots to simmering promising much in the way of eventual direct conflict and potential intellectual complexity. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Instead the film narrows into a series of standard gun battles explosions mad dashes close calls tough-guy fisticuffs ridiculously fast downloading of massive computer files under maximum duress and in the end mawkish sentimentality. All the interest and goodwill built up by the sharply conceived preliminaries is washed away in a succession of scenes that feel crushingly routine and generic not to mention guided by ideological urges. Contaminated in the workplace by radioactivity that leaves him with five days to live Max is convinced by his insurrectionist gangland pal Spider (Wagner Moura) to be painfully fitted with a metal exoskeleton that will turn him into a veritable robo-rebel an abundantly armed knight of the righteous. In an unusually contemporaneous twist they intend to capture Elysian pioneer (William Fichtner) and transfer the central organizational file from his head into Maxs which they believe will open up the Elysian gates to the masses. Trying to orchestrate a coup for her own interests is Armani-clad regime iron lady Delacourt (Jodie Foster) who has an Earthbound stealth agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to do her dirty work. Unfortunately Kruger all but hijacks the film in the late-going with his irrational behavior and cackling -- his sword-twirling villainy comes off as something more appropriate for a live-action cartoon bad guy or an enemy in a 300-like bloodbath. Not helping is Copleys unsoftened South African accent which makes much of his dialogue very difficult to decipher even if the characters intent remains unmistakable. VIDEO Watch the Elysium Trailer Maxs transformation into a part-metal fighting machine may have been conceived as a noble act of self-sacrifice an existential act or both but dramatically it has a highly constricting effect on his behavior as well as on the viewers ability or desire to relate to him. Bereft of full mobility and reduced in effect to a simple fighting machine the character loses his unpredictability along with much of his appeal. Had the climactic action been pitched in a less ordinary way Max could have emerged as a genuine tragic hero but the characters full potential is missed by a long shot. Conceptually as well Blomkamp has failed to take the extra step with both the ruling class and the denizens of the lower depths; despite the fact that the action is set 131 years hence both look exactly as they do now. The fancy mansions of Elysium and their inhabitants wardrobes are exactly what youd find in Malibu or Miami today while the rough-hewn down-and-outers sport tats and attitude and would look right at home in a Fast and Furious film. With his noggin shaved Damon comes off credibly as a ticking time bomb early on but becomes unduly constrained by his metal apparatus later. Foster is all official business and ambition as the devious politician often speaking French to her colleagues and then English in a firm international accent of sorts. Alice Braga plays for empathy as a single mother with a leukemia-stricken little daughter for whom a trip to Elysium represents the final hope. As in District 9 the excellent effects and location work (Mexico City stood in for Los Angeles while Vancouver represented aspects of Elysium) make for a vivid convincing backdrop.

So close and yet so far the colony of Elysium hovers just outside Earths atmosphere a mere 19-minute shuttle ride away but figurative light years for the downtrodden proletarian masses of the 22nd century. So begins the much-anticipated second feature from South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp whose 2009 ""District 9"" was one of the few recent sci-fi/fantasy pics (along with ""Inception"" and ""Children of Men"") that deserved to be called visionary. Here Blomkamp delivers a less dazzling but nonetheless highly absorbing and intelligent socially conscious bit of futurism made on a much larger scale than its 30 million predecessor but with lots of the same scrappy ingenuity. Result confirms the helmer as much more than a one-hit wunderkind and should easily surpass ""District 9s"" 210 million worldwide haul if not its massive profit margin.This story first appeared in the August 06 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Expectations can weigh heavily on a young director (Blomkamp is all of 33) who comes out of nowhere with an unexpected critical and commercial smash. But Blomkamp seems fully at ease and in control from the earliest scenes of ""Elysium"" which introduce us to a futuristic Los Angeles (circa 2154) that has in one of the films canniest conceits effectively become Mexico City (where most of the pic was shot). The only apocalypse that happened here was an environmental and economic one the rich having long ago decamped for their gated community in the sky leaving the underclasses behind to breathe the polluted air and clamor over the scarce remaining resources. (The overhead shots of the filthy teeming city with billowing smoke drifting into a hazy pink sky recall the opening images of ""Blade Runner"" but with the overpopulated centers of the developing world as a template instead of Tokyo.) Simmering or open class warfare has been a rich trope for sci-fi futurecasting as far back as Fritz Langs 1927 ""Metropolis"" and as recently as ""In Time"" ""Total Recall"" and Michael Winterbottoms fine underseen ""Code 46."" Langs influence is particularly evident in ""Elysiums"" army of industrious worker bees slaving away on the factory floor of the Armadyne corporation whose slithery CEO Carlyle (William Fichtner) developed Elysium and all the technology that makes it run. One of those workers is Max (Matt Damon) a former car thief who used to dream that he might someday buy his own ticket to a better life but now just keeps his head down and his nose to the grindstone. Probably because he had a much larger budget and more studio oversight this time around Blomkamp must have felt he had to craft a more traditionally heroic protagonist than ""District 9s"" incompetent corporate lackey Wikus Van De Merwe who owed his job to nepotism and found little sympathy on the homefront after being transformed into a mutant alien. Damons Max undergoes his own life-altering transformation early on in ""Elysium"" doused at work with a toxic dose of radiation that leaves him with only a few days to live. But even before then Max has a glint in his eyes that tells hes the one who will somehow lead his people out of darkness. Max also gets a fairly standard-issue love interest in the form of Frey (Alice Braga) a beneficent nurse whos been sweet on him ever since their childhood days together in a Catholic orphanage. After years apart she re-enters his life with a leukemia-stricken daughter in tow. Together they all seek passage to Elysium where every home comes equipped with a state-of-the-art healing bay that quite literally cures whatever ails you. Even working within a more conventional framework Blomkamp again proves to be a superb storyteller. He has a masters sense of pacing slowly immersing us into his future world rather than assailing us with nonstop action and envisioning that world with an architects eye for the smallest details. Everything on Blomkamp and production designer Philip Iveys Earth seems built for functionality rather than aesthetics and looks slightly out-of-date at best 21st-century technology still slogging along decades later while Elysium is all curvilinear modernism a triumph of form over function. Blomkamp writes juicy characters too and then gives them grand florid entrances. As Elysiums bellicose defense secretary Delacourt Jodie Foster is first seen strutting through a poolside cocktail party speaking her perfect French and sporting a ramrod-straight posture that suggests her stiff white jacket was sent to the dry cleaners with her still inside. (Blomkamp and Foster seem to have envisaged the character as a Frankenstein version of Hillary Clinton.) Best of all is ""District 9"" alumnus Sharlto Copley as Delacourts Earthbound mercenary Kruger who speaks with a South African accent as thick as the fog on Table Mountain and carries himself with the hardy resolve of a cockroach after the Armageddon. Hes a psycho but a psycho who seems to operate by his own inner logic which makes him all the more terrifying and darkly funny. As for Elysium itself it remains largely an abstraction glimpsed only fleetingly and from afar for much of the pics running time during which it seems like a Kubrickian country club with an ineffectual puppet president (Faran Tahir) fully under Delacourts thumb. Instead we spend most of our time on earth where Max promised a ticket to Elysium by the Che-like revolutionary Spider (Brazilian thesp Wagner Moura who has the fiery grandiloquence of the late Raul Julia) takes part in a botched kidnapping of Carlyle and ends up on the run from Kruger one time bomb -- the radiation -- counting down in his bloodstream while another -- classified data downloaded from Carlyles brain -- ticks away in his skull. A more daring film might have risked putting a human (if not necessarily humane) face on the promised lands privileged populace but here they remain a vague cocktail-partying blur -- and of course that much easier to despise. Easier too for ""Elysium"" to advance one of the more openly socialist political agendas of any Hollywood movie in memory beating the drum loudly not just for universal healthcare but for open borders unconditional amnesty and the abolition of class distinctions as well. But Blomkamp never makes it clear how if overpopulation and pollution are what got us into this mess in the first place moving everyone up to Elysium would make for a sustainable solution; he just wants us to take it on faith that it would. Yet if ""Elysium"" falls short as social commentary as entertainment it rarely falters. The final act a breathless cat-and-mouse game inside Elysiums industrial core Max and Kruger outfitted in mechanical suits that make them look like human Transformers is at once the most straightforward stuff in the movie and the most exciting mixing gritty hand-to-hand combat with touches of wuxia-style aerobatics. As in ""District 9"" Blomkamp shows a wizardly eye for visual effects making sure CG images have the proper movement and texture to blend seamlessly with live-action and practical elements. Other craft work is similarly first-rate including tyro composer Ryan Amons judiciously used basso profondo score. Film Review ElysiumReviewed at Sony screening room New York July 29 2013.

Brian Hannan says August 24 2013 at 605 pm Come on This film is awful. Who green-lights this stuff. I loved District 9 and am a big fan of Damon. The trailer made this film look much better than it is. But really we can do without grunge-fi. Where was the story? If its not enough that Damon has to save his own life let him save a kid? And what film did Jodie Foster think she was in - The Queen? Too many subplots and not enough plot. The film looked as if it was written by a lower life-form. Can Hollywood please stop trying to save the planet? We liked it better when it was always blowing it up. Reply ted says August 22 2013 at 821 am Whats the target audience here five year olds? Reply danfromsquirrelhill says August 12 2013 at 345 am ""Elysium"" is implausible because its based on a medical device manufacturer that does not employ any salespeople. http//danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/movie-review-elysium/ Reply danfromsquirrelhill says August 12 2013 at 344 am ""Elysium"" is implausible because its based on a medical device manufacturer that does not employ any salespeople. http//danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/ Reply Mad Damon says August 8 2013 at 942 pm Funny. First Damon commands the unwashed to put their kids in public schools then puts his in an elitist version. Now he plays an unwashed breaking into Elite World. Whats wrong with this picture? Reply John says August 3 2013 at 922 am Matt Damon would be wise to keep his political opinions to himself. I wont support any movie he stars in and wont miss it. Reply Greg Cox says August 4 2013 at 312 pm ^ Who brought the ass-hat?? How about YOU keep your opinions about Damons opinions to yourself and just let the rest of us enjoy some solid sci-fi from a great storyteller. Exactly how large of a douche do you have to be to read a positive review of movie and be like "" Buh buh buh Matt Damon buh buh politics and I wont buy a ticket""? Seeing you think people are not entitled to opinions and the ability to speak there mind heres a big surprise for you John... This movie isnt for you so stay home and watch whichever cable news station has eroded your soul to the point that you cannot enjoy a piece of fiction without jamming your brainwashed down our throats I for one will enjoy it that much more knowing some close-minded asshole didnt take a good seat from a legitimate movie fan. Reply John says August 8 2013 at 533 pm The review described it more like communist agitprop. Im actually shocked to see a frank review of it. groenhagen2Kevin Groenhagen says August 8 2013 at 651 am oooh Greg Cox is one tough guy. Interesting that you believe Damon whose mind was eroded by Howard Zinns fiction can express opinions but John cannot. billy engerson says August 1 2013 at 1011 am cool.wish it to do well. Reply Jay Wilson says August 1 2013 at 746 am Read his interview in WIRED...all young visionaries have great things to say Reply hillplus says August 1 2013 at 746 am And of course those who really live on Elysium are not the job creators the supposed 1%ers. It is government and Hollywood who truly live on Elysium right now. Reply Mike S. says August 1 2013 at 632 am ""beating the drum loudly not just for universal healthcare"". Blomkamp is a South African living in Canada. Do you really think he just gave up a few years of his life to make a movie telling Americans to support universal healthcare? Maybe its not intended to be political or partisan in that way and just reflects his own personal opinions given his multi-cultural background? I can see Americans are going to politicize this film into oblivion. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 10 2013 at 416 pm Funny that you should mention ""oblivion"". The last paragraph of the review reads like several movies before in this so-called blockbuster season. The earth devastated by some apocalyptic off-camera preamble and a hero with high-tech weaponry that in no way survivors can afford to produce own or reload. Whatever the politics of the film (or filmmaker) this premise is shopworn threadbare and just plain old. Reply VinceThePrince says August 1 2013 at 538 am I keep seeing people saying this is a near high budget remake of District 9. Like the character does the same stuff...gets sicks at work and needs to get to a large object in the sky to heal... so he pulls a heist involving his work... all kinds of other things lifted straight from D9. I was really looking forward to this... =( Reply See All 15 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Westworld Divorce amp; Insecure Get Premiere Date On HBO Lindsay Lohan Without Engagement Ring Egor Tarabasov Wedding...
