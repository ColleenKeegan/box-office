With the Crusades-set ""Kingdom of Heaven"" the sullen ""Robin Hood"" and now ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" the director depicts seminal mythological events in bland matter-of-fact terms. While theres a certain academic curiosity to wielding this approach to interpreting the Bible Scotts overlong adaptation of the Old Testaments second book with a squinty-eyed Christian Bale in the Moses role feels like a missed opportunity for the director to flex his fantastical tendencies. After all what are the 10 plagues if not an alien invasion story? Instead this telling of Moses deflection from the Egyptian kingdom that raised him in order to take on Gods orders and free the Israelites from slavery is strictly by the book. Still theres no doubting its impressive scale With no shortage of fire and brimstone it borrows heavily from the Cecil B. Demille playbook presenting a CGI-filled ancient Egypt with appropriate grandiosity. 10 Commandments That Led Christian Bale to Exodus Gods and Kings But it takes a full hour of stone-faced dialogue before Pharohs adopted son (Bale) faces off with the kings natural inheritance Rhamses (Joel Edgerton) about the Hebrews problematic lineage. ""Exodus"" doesnt even try to liven up its material. By the time the plagues erupt in the penultimate act theyre almost like an afterthought -- a nuisance to the characters and a handy device to speed up the plot as it careens toward its prolonged final chase sequence. Thats a shame because the ornate screenplay (which sports four credited writers) regularly distracts from some admittedly impressive visual achievements The sight of locusts swarming the kingdom from afar the insects captured in swooping virtual camera finds its match in the thundering approach of the Egyptian chariots nipping at the heels of the Israelites moments after they leave town. However Scott cant match the inherent excitement of these images with a similarly awe-inspiring story. When Moses encounters an aging slave (Ben Kingsley) who reveals the younger mans origins as an Israelite abandoned by his mother Moses bluntly replies ""The truth is that its not even a good story."" Unfortunately hes right. ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" illustrates a typical contradiction of commercial entertainment By playing it safe the movie fails to enrich the material and never captures the energy that has made its narrative so captivating for millennia. The vast ensemble which includes  a conniving Sigourney Weaver as Ramses scheming mother and a bearded Aaron Paul as Moses right-hand man Joshua never gets the chance to develop much dimensionality. Scotts narrative drifts from one incident to the next with a largely ponderous air. (One might leverage a similar complaint against the Bible itself but thats hardly an excuse note.) Gods childlike appearance only visible to Moses registers in ridiculous terms rather than suggesting anything ominous or powerful. A workmanlike quality hangs over the proceedings the story more clerical than exciting as the plagues seep in. ""From an economic standpoint what youre saying is problematic to say the least"" Moses tells God of his plan to persecute the Egyptians until Rhamses lets the people go. Later defending the plagues to a colleague Moses asserts that ""wars of attrition take time."" It might be the most blatant case of turning otherworldly events into administrative proceedings since ""The Phantom Menace."" As a whole Scotts version of this ancient tale feels oddly toothless -- neither religious or secular viewers will find much substance beyond the basics of the spectacle in play. By contrast Darren Aronofskys wildly uneven ""Noah"" looks like a visionary masterpiece -- or at least an innovative attempt to shake up the familiar ingredients in play. By dialing down the imaginative potential of the story Scott makes his narrative as appealing as a didactic Sunday school lecture. The strongest moment arrives with the credits which open with a heartfelt tribute to the directors brother -- fellow filmmaker Tony Scott who committed suicide two years ago. Considering the story the precedes it in which Moses and Rhamses form a sibling bond that tragically frays over the course of the movie the tribute seems like an appropriate fit. While ""Exodus"" fails as a movie at least its closing tribute hits its mark. Grade C ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" opens nationwide December 12.

Reply Steve Mcqquien May 12 2016 757 pm A lot of old guard (even new guard) bland American film directors and writers need to take off their old lenses and see the wonderful dramatic possibilities that are presented when you utilize people of color in movies like these. This particular story sets place in ancient Mesopotamia/fertile crescent et. al. Picture this Black African Egyptians (the reality) enslaving brown semitic Hebrews. Can you already see visually the dramatic tension that is already at play?? Each successive generation has been so brainwashed to picture Charlton Heston as a Moses and Sir Alec Guiness as Jesus that historical reality has fallen dismally and creatively to the wayside. In this film my understanding is that Rid Scott and his cronies even went as far as to depict the black Egyptian/Africans as slaves?? Haaha. Its too much and more than enough people have had enough of it. Reply bill in seattle May 12 2016 757 pm it looks like fun. something tells me the critics werent wild about DeMilles take on it either. Reply Daniel23 May 12 2016 757 pm Ridley Scott has 2 undisputable masterpieces Blade Runner amp; Alien; 2 almost-classics Thelma amp; Louise Gladiator; 3 flawed but impressive epics Kingdom of Heaven directors cut American Gangster Black Hawk Down; 2 decent `small films The Duellists Matchstick Men. Admittedly thats 9 good-to-great films which is more than most directors can lay claim to. But when you add the remaining 12 films to the mix - you get a long list of ponderous tone-deaf humorless misfires with some occasional impressive lighting. Sad to say but after the back-to-back heartbreaks of Robin Hood Body of Lies Prometheus The Counselor I had zero desire to see Exodus and sadly it seems like this review confirms Ridley as a visually talented hack who doesnt actually know what a good script is anymore - or what makes a movie live and breathe and be more than just a collection of pretty pictures. Shame. Reply drbopperthp May 12 2016 757 pm Utilitarian tripe rife with racist castings - boycott and begone. Reply please May 12 2016 757 pm Hasnt this story been done before and a million times better by Prince of Egypt?

I agree its more like a Marvel Comic in the way the characters are portrayed but the effects are very impressive. Since no one was there 2000 years ago this is as accurate as the bible which is about as accurate as Harry Potter and the Book of Mormon. Just enjoy it and stop whining about a god. Its nonsense. Tony McCarty said on Saturday January 17 2015 102133 PMThis movie is a blasphemy dont like it the director didnt have guidance from the bible nothing in the movie was from bible and they change all the words people pls read the bible read the book exodus and you realize that this movie is a blasphemy people God is coming soon dont be confuse Landonsaid on Sunday January 04 2015 10425 AMThis movie is horrible and disrespectful to God to every Christian and to every Jewish believer The movie is anti-biblical garbage. Shame on Mr. Scott for taking away the power and miracles God demonstrated to save his people and humble the pharaoh I got one more comment mr. Scott I want my fifty dollars back No Red Sea parting just RIDICILOUS Shame on all who were involved in this blasphemous movie I pray that God forgives them all. Chuck Rsaid on Sunday January 04 2015 122319 AMSorry Dan M this movie was pathetic. I feel my wife and I waste the money. Moses was very badly played and not a convincing ""leader"" too hesitant. The biblical accuracy of this is so far out the window it never got in the room to get out. God as a little ""british"" speaking boy ??? Well I guess the director could have made God a gay transvestite. I did not view Scotts ""The Counselor"" but no matter I would not view anything he does. -1 Alex Limsaid on Thursday January 01 2015 72737 PMOne of the elements of film making is having a good enough story to drive its other elements. As the title alone suggests - Gods and Kings it is clearly a fictional account of the story of Moses. There is only one God in Judaism. Not Gods. That alone should tell you not to expect a truthful account of the story. If people wanted a truthful account go watch a documentary. Just because Cecile B. DeMile tried to be truthful in his Ten Commandments is no benchmark for making an epic movie about the story. A good story is always a good story it doesnt matter if it was truthful or a lie. Entertainment is not about being truthful. Its about suspending disbelief. And boy did this movie do so with the highest possible craftsmanship in 21st century movie making. If you want to be entertained by sheer awesome spectacle that so few directors can helm watch this. To some extent the movie is iconoclastic shattering what even I hold to be true about the biblical story. But thats basically a matter of cinematic and creative interpretation when it comes to story-telling. To those offended by its distortions of biblical truth just remember this is cinematic arts it is not a religious sermon. It could be but doesnt have to. Bryansaid on Tuesday December 30 2014 101104 AMThis is what drives me crazy about hollywood. Whenever they try to take the bible to the big screen their green eyes blinds them of what is written. Heck the script is already written so just follow the script. This movie was very disappointing. They made God seem to be a obnoxious 10yr old kid who was only full of anger. I wont even get started on their werent any africans in the film and the entire thing took plae in Egypt. I give this movie a C- Mikesaid on Tuesday December 30 2014 120729 AMThanks Rich for an objective honest review of a movie made by respected artists. Im going to see it tomorrow. Yehyasaid on Sunday December 28 2014 80738 AMAs ewan in this thread have posted if you dont believe in the story dont make the movie true you cant remove the religious part of it where you should expect that most of your audience have seen or heard about that historical events and are eager to see it with their owns eyes the movie was very poorly executed with the following miss opportunities that could have made it far more impactful 1) the first time god spoke with moses cane after he was hit with a rock 2)ok if you want to choose a human to represent god  but kids are innocent and playful by nature  it doesnt look mighty or divine thus irrelevant with all the suffering that god has given to ramasis 3) the ocean scene this is one the most epic miracle probably in the history (regardless if its true or not) but couldnt the director use 21 centuries tech and visual effects to give more of an appeal More than just strong current and then a storm The story could have been the hit of 2014 but just like noah very poorly presented to the audience. Ewan Robertssaid on Wednesday December 17 2014 101050 AMThis movie was awful. It was slow. It was inaccurate. The attempts at political correctness were sickening. Humanizing God was not a problem for me but making it seem like Moses got hit on the head and hallucinated their entire meeting was offensive. Altering the story of the plagues Offensive. Having a Hebrew child holding a cross and then pharaoh finding a cross to determine the Hebrews whereabouts was factually ridiculous and offensive. Richard romper saw a completely different movie than the one I saw. If you are going to make a movie about a religious story then you cant avoid the religion part of it. If you dont believe the story perhaps you shouldnt make the movie. Anouksaid on Tuesday December 16 2014 40351 PMIts absurd that these characters are represented as white people. Ancient Egyptians represented themselves as black Africans in their art work and artifacts. Moses and other biblical characters were certainly not white.

Moments later when the camera closed in on Pharaoh himself played as something akin to a glam-rock drag queen by a bald and gaudily face-mascaraed John Turturro I almost thought that my dream had come true.But no. Theres no Elvis in Scotts wildly misconstrued 140 million biblical epic. There are giant crocodiles and chariot chases and tidal waves and quite possibly the most bewildering array of accents--both genuine and affected--ever to be collected in a single motion picture. But no Elvis. In his place we have Christian Bale as Moses which feels almost as strange to type as it does to witness onscreen.Related Story Gods Will vs. Mans Will in Darren Aronofskys Noah Before I continue a brief digression regarding the title of the film. The recent ubiquity of the colon in cinematic nomenclature--typically to advertise a franchise connection as in X-Men Days of Future Past or The Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies--has proven an annoying and generally unnecessary flourish. (Generations of 007 fans managed to find their way to the multiplex without bread-crumb titles like Bond Thunderball and Bond The Spy Who Loved Me.) But what in the world is going on with Exodus Gods and Kings? Its as if Scott couldnt choose between two titles--one for the biblically attuned another for everyone else--so he just crammed them together with a colon as buffer.Alas the title is the least of the movies problems. This is a film that aspires to be an action flick a character study and a theological meditation and fails on each count. The CGI is often spectacular--the palaces the armies the plagues of frogs and hail and locusts--and it comes as close as anything else to offering a rationale for the movies existence. But the special effects are never persuasively integrated into the drama instead playing as rowdy intermissions from it.The story told between these digitized spectacles is the familiar one Moses is raised as a member of the Egyptian royal family side by side with ruler-to-be Ramses II (Joel Edgerton). Upon discovering his Jewish heritage he flees across the Red Sea to Midian where he meets and marries Zipporah (Maria Valverde) in a ceremony presented as suspiciously modern and egalitarian. Granted a vision by God he returns to Egypt to free his (and His) people.I would be remiss here not to describe Moses interactions with God who in Scotts telling is principally depicted as appearing in the guise of a little boy. (The burning bush barely gets a cameo.) Scott chose for the role an 11-year-old Brit named Isaac Andrews on the grounds that he exuded ""innocence and purity."" Now obviously the Voice of God is a tough role for any performer let alone one who has not yet hit puberty. But where Scott detected innocence and purity I confess I saw mostly an irritable petulance. (Moses ""Where have you been?"" God/boy ""Watching you fail."") This is the first portrayal of God Ive ever encountered who looked like he could use a good spanking.As Moses Bale gives it his customary all. But intensity is not the same thing as moral gravity and all too often Moses comes off as a bearded Batman. It does not help matters that Bale has prematurely adopted the late-Pacino acting tic of alternating between whispers and shouts.This is the first portrayal of God Ive ever encountered who looked like he could use a good spanking.Behind Bale the rest of the cast is an almost unmitigated disaster a haphazard assortment of performers who often seem to be inhabiting different movies altogether. Scott has taken some flack for ""whitewashing"" the film but perhaps more notable is the randomness with which he has done so. The Egyptian royal family includes actors Italian-American (Turturro) Australian (Edgerton) WASP-y American (Sigourney Weaver especially out of place here) Israeli Arab (Hiam Abbass) and Iranian (Golshifteh Farahani). Breaking Bads Aaron Paul makes an appearance as Joshua scarcely recognizable under a scruffy beard and Ben Kingsley is the movies go-to-guy for gravitas as his father Nun. Just when you think the casting cant get any stranger in wanders Ewen Bremner who played ""Spud"" in Trainspotting.As was the case with his earlier Middle Eastern epic Kingdom of Heaven Scotts talents are a poor match for his material Hes always been more at ease composing striking visuals than exploring competing moral visions. (See for example Prometheus.) Its clear that he would like to dig beneath the ideological surface of his tale--he does after all recount the divine massacre of thousands of Egyptian children--but unlike Darren Aronofsky with Noah he fails to produce even the semblance of a coherent vision. Plagues rain down seas are parted and tablets are etched. But no one in Exodus Gods and Kings has anything remotely meaningful to say.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox Rhamses (Joel Edgerton) and Moses (Christian Bale) in Ridley Scotts Exodus Gods and Kings. Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox The tale of Moses is not exactly fresh cinematic material so anyone attempting an update would to be wise to have a theme. The subtitle of Exodus Gods and Kings suggests that Ridley Scott intended just that. The director must have meant to contrast the decadent Egyptian pharaohs who imagined themselves divine with the humbler servant of the Hebrew G-d. That idea is submerged somewhere in Scotts bombastic epic. But its about as easy to read as the message plucked from a chickens entrails for the edification of Seti (John Turturro) Egypts Pharaoh when the story begins. The resulting prophecy is like the movie bloody and inconclusive. Crowd-wowing CGI spectacle and the inevitable if inconsequential 3-D effects make Exodus look like pure product without any defining vision. At least Darren Aronofskys Noah however nutty had a point of view. Scott has described himself as an agnostic and he immediately challenges the faithful by setting the action in 1300 B.C.E. -- ""Before Common Era"" the designation preferred by academics and some non-Christians over B.C. (""Before Christ""). Whenever possible Scott and the four credited scripters treat the purely mythic story as if it occurred in a world bound by the laws of science. The 10 plagues pumped up with the addition of voracious crocodiles are presented as logically proceeding from one to the other. And the Red Sea crossing suggests that Moses and his followers benefited from the receding waters of a perfectly timed tsunami. Yet Exodus doesnt avoid the supernatural when theres no other alternative. That bush still burns and its a phantom menace not Jewish ninjas that kills Egypts first-born. The filmmakers also follow established nonbiblical traditions. They identify the Pharaoh of the Exodus as Ramses -- spelled ""Rhamses"" in the credits -- and indicate that Moses became an Egyptian prince before discovering his true heritage. Neither of those details is in the original account. At first the model for Exodus seems to be Scotts own Gladiator. Theres a massive battle -- with the Hittites not that it matters -- and tension because the dying ruler favors surrogate son Moses over his real one Rhamses. (Sibling rivalry is another underdeveloped motif although the film is dedicated to Tony Scott the directors late brother.) Setis preference for Moses is hardly surprising since the adoptee is a bearded Christian Bale as virile (if not quite so growly) as his Batman. Meanwhile the pharaonic first family recalls a glam-rock act. Rhamses (Joel Edgerton) sports a shaved head and black mascara and plays with a veritable Slytherin of pet snakes. Overseeing the enslaved Jewish workers is a corrupt viceroy (Ben Mendelsohn) who offers Moses sex in exchange for not reporting his graft. Hes a fetid cliche sailed out of Caligula and down the Nile. Eventually Moses is exiled encounters a petulant preteen G-d (11-year-old Isaac Andrews) and returns to free his people. The movies latter half becomes jerky as it hurries to fit in all the expected events and yet is not without tediously overextended sequences. Perhaps Scotts four-hour cut likely to show up on Blu-ray next year will have a more consistent rhythm. The director whos under fire for relegating Middle Eastern actors to tiny roles altogether ignores Afrocentrist notions of ancient Egypt. But then Exodus has only enough unconventional ideas to offend the most literal-minded believers. Its principal ingredient is bluster a haranguing score the video game grandeur of the Egyptian capital and a cast of thousands of which the goats are generally more engaging than the humans. Many of the movies quadrupeds suffer horrible fates but at least theyre spared the worst of all deliverings Exoduss clunky dialogue.

As the plagues descend upon Egypt Scott lets loose a carnival of horrors each building on the previous. 118 Shares Share 83 Tweet 32 Share 2 Share Email Print Share Photo Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox Exodus Gods and Kings is as uneven as Ridley Scotts career; at times it seems to be a journey through the directors greatest strengths and weaknesses. The good news is that his strengths eventually win out; the bad news is all the awkward storytelling and botched character interactions we have to wade through to get to the good stuff. Once we do though Exodus is a hoot. The Moses tale is familiar to pretty much everybody but leave it to Scott who has always favored mood and imagery over narrative and character to mess up the initial story beats. We begin with Moses (Christian Bale) and his adoptive brother Ramses (Joel Edgerton) preparing to attack the army of the Hittites. On the eve of battle their father the current pharaoh (John Turturro resisting the urge to yell ""It dont mattah to Jeezus"") learns of a prophecy that says that someone will save someones life and that the person who did the saving will become king. Thats about as vague as a prophecy can get but its enough to send Ramses spiraling into paranoia as soon as Moses saves him during the bloody melee with the Hittites. Despite that setup Scott and his cavalcade of screenwriters never quite crack Ramses motivations. Hes suspicious yet supposedly torn by his affection for Moses even though we rarely sense said affection. They also cant quite crack Moses awakening to his Jewish heritage. He initially hears of it in the town of Pithom from Nun (Ben Kingsley) an enslaved Israelite and father of the rebel Joshua (an eerily underused Aaron Paul) but he doesnt believe it. However the abject conditions of the Hebrew slaves in Pithom do get Moses blood boiling and for a while the film tries to juggle our heros skepticism about his lineage with his disillusionment over the way things are being run; but the results are more convoluted than nuanced. In truth the stodginess of these early scenes almost consume the entire film; I spent much of this first hour alternately confused sleepy and bewildered at how low the great Ridley Scott seemed to have fallen. And then God shows up. Here he comes to Moses in the form of a young boy Malak (Isaac Andrews). Their interactions are curious almost hostile as Malak pushes Moses toward greater extremism in his effort to free the Jews from enslavement. Moses stands up to Malak and even expresses disagreement with the deitys ruthless tactics. Their exchanges at times feel like a debate between equals and God even suggests that Moses is free to leave whenever he wants. Much has been made of the fact that Ridley Scott himself is a nonbeliever but that shouldnt really surprise anybody. Two of the greatest Christ movies (Pier Paolo Pasolinis The Gospel According to Matthew and Roberto Rossellinis The Messiah) came from atheists and as my pal Steven Greydanus film critic for the National Catholic Register has argued some of the best religious films have been made by nonbelievers. Maybe its because skeptical filmmakers have to convince themselves too along with their imagined viewers. Even the most familiar story starts from zero in its retelling and weaves its world anew. Once Moses has his mission Exodus comes breathtakingly alive. As the plagues descend upon Egypt Scott lets loose a carnival of horrors each building on the previous one. Armies of crocodiles swarm the Nile feasting on each other which turns the water red with blood which then pushes frogs out of the river and spreads flies and disease. Its spectacular terrifying visceral stuff but it doesnt deny the Egyptians their humanity either The plagues dont discriminate between bad royalty and innocent commoners. That leads to the exodus part of Exodus as Moses leads the Jews out of Egypt with Ramses in pursuit. The rockslides and waves and thundering armies are eye-poppingly impressive and the film finally becomes what its been trying to be all along the first honest-to-goodness biblical epic since the days of Cecil B. De Mille and George Stevens. (Lets not miss however the irony that such traditionalism is being delivered to us by Ridley Scott who once seemed the most modern of directors.) That spirit of old-fashioned spectacle -- corny earnest indulgent insistent kitschy -- is probably the best way to approach Exodus. Its also the best way to approach some of the frustratingly lily-white casting choices. Yes its probably true that Scott needed someone like Christian Bale to make sure he could get his film made. And casting a Middle Eastern actor -- a ""Mohammed so-and-so from such-and-such"" in the directors immortally tin-eared phrasingA -- as Ramses the bad guy might have been dubious in our politically sensitive times. But speaking as a bit of a ""Mohammed-so-and-so"" myself Im not sure Joel Edgerton cavorting around in orangeface is any less offensive. That said Scott has at least loaded up part of his supporting cast with more diverse faces including the Iraqi-Danish actor Dar Salim the Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani (the riveting lead of Ashghar Farhadis About Elly and the love interest in Scotts Body of Lies) the Egyptian actor Ghassan Massoud (who memorably played Saladin in Scotts Kingdom of Heaven) and the Indian-British actress Indira Varma (Luther Kama Sutra). Maybe in the inevitable directors extended edition theyll actually have some real lines.

Otherwise Ridley Scotts take on the great contest between Moses and Pharoah is underwhelming and ill-conceived. First the underwhelming nearly everyone -- from Christian Bales doubtful grouchy Moses to Joel Edgertons frowny pouty Ramses to Ben Kingsleys sanguine Hebrew priest -- seems eager to underplay and humanize their characters as if to say ""Were just regular folks who happen to be engaged in an epic struggle over whose God will dominate Western Civilization for the next few millennia. Dont mind us. These fancy headpieces and divine plagues? Just window dressing really. In the end its just an argument about civil rights."" Which brings us to the ill-conceived part its true that some modern people still believe in the Old Testament God but that doesnt mean it makes sense to have your Old Testament figures talk and think like modern people. ""What kind of God tells a man to leave his family?"" asks a woman who also tells her child that hes not allowed to climb ""Gods mountain."" ""Is this your God? A killer of children?"" asks a horrified Ramses shortly after he has declared himself a god and promised to murder all the Hebrew children. ""Is this meant to humble me?"" asks Moses after God has already humbled him. You get the idea. And portraying God as a snotty English schoolboy may have looked clever on paper but it does get annoying. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Entertainment Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods And Kings"" Offers An Embarrassingly Outdated View Of Race The new Christian Bale-led Biblical film updates Moses in every way except the most important one. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Christian Bale in Exodus Gods and Kings Twentieth Century Fox ID 4455989 Exodus Gods and Kings updates the story of Moses in every way except the one that would actually be gutsy race. Ridley Scotts latest film attempts to do for Moses what Batman Begins did for its title superhero -- give its saga a grim brawny overhaul and place it in a more realistic world. In place of a revamped Batmobile and other comic book trappings it has a revamped parting of the Red Sea with men confronting each other as the tide rushes back in in the form of massive waves. Its version of ancient Egypt has been lightly dredged in mud and dust the royal spaces airy and spacious and slave quarters cramped and dark. Moses starts the film not by being fished out of the Nile as a baby but all grown-up as Christian Bale strapping on armor and accompanying his brother Ramses (Australian actor Joel Edgerton) into an arrow- chariot- and sword-filled fight with the Hittites. While Moses has been cast as an action hero later training the Israelites in the ways of guerrilla warfare the religious aspect to his story has been softened leaving open the possibility that his communications with God are simply delusions and that there are scientific explanations for the plagues. And the language has been stripped of biblical floweriness and modernized in ways that yield some inadvertent laugh lines -- ""From an economic standpoint alone what youre asking is problematic to say the least"" Ramses tells Moses in response to his demands that the Israelites be treated as citizens or released. ID 4443113 Joel Edgerton Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox Christian Bale Aaron Paul Ben Kingsley Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox ID 4456158 Its The Ten Commandments for our modern blockbuster age -- darker more humorless and more macho with plenty of grit to pick out of its clenched teeth. The female characters have less of a place in this testosteroned-out tale of rival siblings than in Cecil B. DeMilles florid 1956 classic. Hiam Abbass as Moses adoptive mother Bithiah has a few lines while Sigourney Weaver as Ramses ruthless mother Tuya gets only a few more. The tragic Nefertari (Golshifteh Farahani) is barely a presence though Zipporah (Maria Valverde) the woman whom Moses marries registers a little more. But the focus is on Moses whom Scott and screenwriters Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian present as this slightly frightening off-kilter figure speaking for a God who is represented on screen as a petulant child (Isaac Andrews) and whose agenda is more brutal than that of his prophet. Moses is played by Bale who actually was Batman not so long ago and like most of the main actors is white. Scott has been dismissive of complaints about the casting choices of Exodus Gods and Kings in the wince-inducing way of someone to whom the issue never occurred. ""I cant mount a film of this budget where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such"" he said to Variety. ""Im just not going to get it financed. So the question doesnt even come up."" At the premiere he told the AP that those threatening a boycott should ""get a life."" ID 4455758 View this image > Joel Edgerton Sigourney Weaver John Turturro Christian Bale Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox ID 4456227 According to Scott its just business though his argument would hold more water if Bales co-star Edgerton (who is fine in a role that seems written for camp) were anywhere near as big a draw or if Scotts movie didnt seem to be going in the opposite direction of other giant productions that are incorporating more multicultural casting for broader global appeal. Scott represents a decades-old attitude that white actors are neutral that they have the broadest appeal and the widest castability a creaky assumption that doesnt align with the times we live in today. If in theory Exodus Gods and Kings finds a powerful filmmaker shrugging and giving in without a fight to his assumptions about the industrys race problem in practice it looks embarrassing presenting an intricately realized Egypt filled with various characters of color until you get to the main ones who are all played by white actors in bronzer. Because its not like race doesnt exist in Exodus Gods and Kings which peoples its background extras and minor roles with actors of various shades of non-whiteness including Indira Varma as a meddlesome high priestess and Dar Salim as Ramses chief commander. But then you have John Turturro in eyeliner as the pharaoh Seti and Aaron Paul as the future Israelite leader Joshua and Ben Mendelsohn as the abusive viceroy (and evil homosexual) Hegep because a spritz of spray tan is apparently enough to make someone fit seamlessly in with these people of of color. It may not be intentional but the film nevertheless designates the characters youre supposed to pay attention to by their skin tone and gives in to the long tradition of making biblical stories ""universal"" by pretending the characters in them fit into the confines of contemporary whiteness. ID 4455762 View this image > Twentieth Century Fox ID 4456241 Exodus Gods and Kings feels too dreary to be offensive. Its just a movie that attempts to contemporize an ancient story but thanks to its casting it was destined to feel discomfiting and dated before it even finished shooting. Like Noah which generated its own heated discussions about race when it premiered earlier this year but which at least took place in a mythological unreal realm Exodus Gods and Kings is at its most interesting when it unflinchingly depicts an Old Testament God. Its angry boy angelic spokesperson is impatient and not at all comforting which is a provocative way to get at a divine force who among other things kills a whole slew of Egyptian children in order to make a point. That plague and the others that precede it including the Nile turning to blood frogs boils and storms are depicted in lovingly gruesome detail in the film from the moment a group of giant crocodiles devours a ship and then each other. In Exodus Gods and Kings Ridley Scott shows himself to be much better at reinventing destruction than bringing a new vision to an old tale.

"Exodus Gods and Kings | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; exodus-gods-and-kings ) Exodus Gods and Kings (USA/UK/Spain 2014) December 12 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Exodus represents Ridley Scotts attempt to emulate Cecil B. DeMille. Comparisons with The Ten Commandments are both unavoidable and appropriate. Considering the mixed critical reaction to the 1956 spectacle it is perhaps surprising that Exodus comes up short on nearly every one of those comparisons except perhaps visual splendor. Theres no debating that Scott has produced a sumptuous feast for the eyes (although the 3-D is as is sadly often the case superfluous) but the screenplay (credited to four screenwriters) is a mess the pacing is uneven the acting is inconsistent and the experience as a whole is a letdown. At 2 1/2 hours the movie is actually too short to adequately tell the full tale (The Ten Commandments is 70 minutes longer) but that doesnt prevent Scott from presenting multiple seemingly endless scenes of people crossing deserts. In the main Exodus chronicles the key events surrounding the rise of Moses (Christian Bale) as the leader of the Hebrews in slavery the plagues sent by God the decision of Ramses (Joel Edgerton) to let the Israelites go and the pursuit to the Red Sea of the Egyptians. In broad strokes Exodus is faithful to the outline presented in the Bible book of the same name but the devils in the details. In the first place theres too much material to effectively cram into 150 minutes. As a result there are several jarring gaps in the narrative and instances when events move too quickly to have the proper level of gravitas. The plagues are a perfect example these are presented as orgies of special effects with little exploration of the human impact. At times such as when a mass of giant crocodiles attack the productiong feels like its veering into exploitation film territory. There are also scenes (such as one late in the proceedings when Moses is chiseling out the Ten Commandment) that teeter on the edge of parody. Its not a good thing to be watching a supposed epic and flash back to Mel Brooks The History of the World Part One. Skin color issues aside some of the casting choices are questionable. Christian Bale who is undoubtedly on board primarily because of his name is never credible as Moses. Part of the problem is that hes being asked to play a character whos half-Moses/half-Job with deep concerns about his faith and huge reservoirs of self-doubt. This is a Moses for the nihilistic generation. Charlton Heston for all his bluster made Moses into a larger than life character viewers could identify with. (Those who spend the entirety of Exodus waiting for Bale to declare ""Let my people go"" should know that he never speaks those words.) Joel Edgertons Ramses also falls victim to poor writing. The character is given some ""character building"" scenes showing his devotion to his son but hes also painted as being petty and venal. His court is filled with snakes but the politics (along with most of Sigourney Weavers role) appear to have been left in the cutting room. The ""brotherly"" relationship between Moses and Ramses is as cold as ice. Theres never any pretense that these two like each other so its not much of a tragedy when they end up on opposite sides. Of the ""name"" actors the only one who does a good job is Ben Kingsley and hes only on screen for ten minutes. Perhaps the biggest misstep is to have God represented not by a booming disembodied voice but by 11-year old Isaac Andrews. This image of The Almighty is so absurd as to render nearly every scene in which he appears almost satirical. One doesnt have to be believer to understand that a god - any god - needs to be imposing to work on screen. The guise of a petulant child is far too commonplace to inspire awe. Bible purists may also be irritated by the decision to have the Red Sea parted via a tsunami rather than by a wave of Moses hand but that strikes me more as an instance of artistic license that a faux pas. If theres a saving grace and a reason to stick it out through Exodus seemingly interminable running time its that the movie is visually impressive. Although there are some scenes in which the CGI is obvious and overdone there are also some eye-popping moments. Not all of these are the big showy scenes like the plagues and the Red Sea crossing. I was most impressed by the detail evident in the aerial shots of ancient Egypt. Theres no denying that at times Exodus is immersive but that quality is fleeting too often undone by a scattershot and uneven screenplay and a complete lack of emotional impact. Characters pop up and disappear with alarming regularity. Plot points are glossed over. A romance happens in less than two minutes (this is not an exaggeration). In some ways its like Noah in that a more secular interpretation of a Bible story has resulted in some bizarre choices. But this is sloppier than Noah and thats hard to forgive especially from a director of Scotts stature. Exodus is far from the worst movie of 2014 but it may be the years most disappointing.

The late Mike Nichols had a comedy routine with his partner Elaine May mocking the 1950s biblical-movie craze in which May played a talk-show guest who boasts about her upcoming role in a ""life of God"" titled The Big Sky. That was back when Hollywood was fighting the encroachment from the world of television by offering what TV couldnt colourful widescreen spectacle grand themes sin and action. In the contemporary era when new stay-at-home entertainment options have again threatened the movie industry the studios have fought back with blockbuster 3-D comic books. Gamings favourite raider of tombs is back in ""Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris."" Also this week the popular shooter ""Destiny"" gets its first expansion pack and ""The Talos Principle"" combines strategy and philosophy. CP Video Gaming Video Lara Croft returns for more tomb raiding At the New York premiere of his new drama The Gambler Mark Wahlberg talks about the rumors and the real reasons for him wanting a pardon for an assault charge he received when he was a teen. (Dec. 11) AP Video Video Video Why Mark Wahlberg wants a pardon for his criminal past Like the biblical movies they involve the difficult moral decisions of those who are supernaturally endowed allowing for lots of sententious talk and ooh-and-ahh-inspiring special effects. It was only a matter of time before we got the Bible-epic/serious-comic-book hybrid. Exodus is the second this year after Darren Aronofskys Noah. The 3-D movie Exodus Gods and Kings stars Batman himself Christian Bale as the tunicked crusader Moses determined to free his people from the dark forces of oppression.The controversy that has swirled around Exodus Gods and Kings is not as you might imagine about cartooning the Bible or that Moses is played by an actor named Christian. Its about the number of white actors in key roles representing Middle Eastern and African characters. While the pale skin tones (bronzer is selectively applied) and haphazard mix of American and British accents is distracting it barely scratches the surface of Exoduss ungainly artificiality.We begin with the usual Bible movie set-up - gym-ripped men in skirts and eye makeup scowling and making lofty pronouncements. Bale first appears onscreen as the already grown-up Moses a bluff general residing in the palace of the ailing effete pharaoh Seti (John Turturro). Moses has both a sibling bond and rivalry with the pharaoh-to-be Ramses (Joel Edgerton). In an early battle against the Hittite hordes Moses saves Ramsess life earning Setis special favour while sewing the seeds of Ramsess future enmity.Soon after Moses pays a visit to the massive construction town of Pithom to check out trouble among the Israelite slaves. An ahead-of-his-time rationalist who rolls his eyes at the religious kooks in the Egyptian court hes rattled when hes informed by Jewish elder Nun (Ben Kingsley) that hes the prophesied Jewish deliverer. The secret gets leaked to the corrupt effeminate viceroy (Ben Mendelsohn) who helps push Moses into exile. He heads to the Hebrew community of Midian where he becomes a shepherd and marries the tattooed beauty Zipporah (Maria Valverde) and where he discovers his mission.So far almost by the Book but the script credited to four writers (including Oscar winner Steve Zaillian) is anachronistic and almost comically clumsy. Ramsess response to Mosess request to let his people go ""From an economic standpoint what you suggest is problematic to say the least.""The awkwardness is a product of director Ridley Scotts design an attempt to present an ambiguous quasi-historical take on the Bible. Each of the miraculous events in Exodus is treated with a sort of double bookkeeping one foot in revelation the other in reason. Thus Mosess first encounter with God is presented as a possible hallucination brought on by a head injury in a rock slide. When Moses comes to the Lord speaks to him in the form of an angel a petulant 10-year-old English schoolboy (Isaac Andrews) so bloody-minded he might have stepped out of William Goldings Lord of the Flies. Or rather in a busy 10-minute montage of computer-generated atrocities visited on the Egyptians hes the Lord of the Blood Flies Frogs Locusts Boils and Death of the First-Born children.One of the profound mysteries of Exodus (the movie not the Bible book) is who the intended target audience is for this grandly engineered bombast. Faith-based groups will need to tune out the movies skepticism along with the directors professed atheism and Bales assertion that Moses was probably ""schizophrenic."" Action fans dont get much more than a Ben Hur-like sequence of chariots tumbling off narrow mountain trails - the thrills are well-spaced out over the films 150-minute running time.In the movies climactic moment when the massive CGI sky darkens and whirls when the walls of water rise in front of Israelites on the shore and the pharaohs army behind them the viewers thoughts are not raised to the Big Sky just bombarded by a large screen full of moving pixels.

And thats too bad. Say what you like about old Cecil B. -- and you could begin with ""hypocritical"" ""reactionary"" and ""corny as Kansas in June"" - but the old man knew how to deliver good campy spectacle. And that is not Ridley Scott -- nor is ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" DeMilles ""The Ten Commandments."" Which is fine. But neither is it the sort of seriously hallucinatory yet oddly reverent take on the Old Testament that Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" was. Instead Scotts movie is a mish-mash -- part half-committed melodrama part half-thought-out political provocation. In this version (credited to four different screenwriters) we begin with Moses already a prince of Egypt an ancient empire where according to Hollywood tradition the ruling classes all have British accents. (Also mostly blue eyes - all the better to show off their eyeliner.) Bales Exodus Gods and Monsters has more spectacle than human drama. FOX Moses though then learns the scandalous secret of his birth -- hes not only adopted but the son of a Jewish slave. Sent into exile he wanders marries begins a family. Until he spies a burning bush. This is not significantly different from the Bible or even the DeMille favorite (although John Turturro as a pharaoh does take some getting used to). But then the Almighty appears before Moses in corporeal form. And hes a slightly smudged 11-year-old boy. Its not theologically unsound but it is an odd idea that the film cant quite develop. Is the casting meant to suggest a God full of a childs openness and idealism? Or of a small boys willfulness and violence? (Mostly the latter it seems; Scotts deity comes off as a bit of a brat.) Moses meanwhile is cast -- not as the tongue-tied messenger of scripture -- but as a revolutionary who leads Jewish slaves in acts of civilian sabotage and terrorism. Scott often seems to think he has Big Thoughts but drawing a line from Moses to Hamas is not one of them. Hes better as he always is at images. Computer-generated or not his visualization of ancient Egypt - with its impassive necropolis and teaming slums -- is breathtaking. There are several exciting scenes with racing chariots and -- unlike the upcoming ""Hobbit"" finale -- his swordfights are gripping and clearly staged. But some of the details -- Nile crocodiles the size of dinosaurs a plague of boils that never goes away -- are overdone without being effective while some of the performances are overstated without being fun. Christian Bale is terribly terribly serious as Moses -- yet we never get a sense of his anguish at being raised with a lie nor any glimmer of his charisma. Aaron and even Joshua (played by the typically too-excitable Aaron Paul) are practically written out of the narrative. Joel Edgertons Ramses meanwhile brings little of the bitterness this Cain-and-Abel narrative demands as one unappreciated son faces off against fathers favorite. One of the reasons Scotts ""Gladiator"" worked so well was that it pushed personal drama to the forefront; here the director mistakes 3D for true depth. A few fine actors -- Sigourney Weaver Ben Kingsley -- show up to do very little; many images (a Red Sea clotted with drowning Egyptian charioteers) linger in the mind. Theres a dedication to detail -- suppurating sores bloody entrails desert sunburns -- that ranges from the refreshingly realistic to the needlessly off-putting. But in a story made up of miracles and wonders theres very little magic -- and even less inspiration. Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality.

(c) 2013 - Twentieth Century Fox Titles Exodus Gods and Kings Names Christian Bale Characters Moses Still of Christian Bale in Exodus Gods and Kings (2014)(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Sometimes spectacle is not enough and too much.Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is a prime example of such overkill/underkill. It has visuals and grandiose special effects aplenty a classic story with twisted roots on full display and -- for a film about religious beliefs -- no soul whatsoever. It is at best numbing but more often simply boring.This is the tale of Moses (Christian Bale) an unwitting Jew raised as royalty among the Egyptians even as his people are enslaved. When the truth about his heritage is unveiled he is banished from the kingdom sent off in the wilderness to die. Of course he comes back as a freedom fighter or terrorist depending on your point of view.Working with him is God or Gods emissary or something of the sort a dour little kid (Issac Andrews) who decides to help Moses -- or at least hurt the Egyptians -- by sending in a series of CGI effects (locusts frogs blood in the water etc.). For his closing number he just outright murders hundreds of Egyptian children.While this may be how the story goes it doesnt make God out to be a terribly sympathetic character or a particularly sharp negotiator.Eventually the slaves are freed and Moses parts the sea so everyone can head back to Israel. The sea parting is something of an anti-climactic dull puddle-making exercise.Unlike Darren Aronofskys far superior ""Noah"" there is no real examination or re-imagining of the story here no digging for deeper meaning. ""Exodus"" is an exercise in visual trickery that reaches for nothing beyond the obvious.

(Twentieth Century Fox Film)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 13 2014 Back in ancient times say 1956 when Charlton Heston led the Israelites on their epic march out of Egypt in Cecil B. DeMilles The Ten Commandments miracles like the parting of the Red Sea were indeed miraculous. Matte paintings rear projection a gigantic U-shaped water tank hundreds of costumed extras leaning into wind machines all that livestock the duck that waddles out of the frame - the coordination of actors animals machinery props hair stylists dolly grips truly astoundingThat VistaVision vision of Moses leading the legion of slaves across the suddenly pedestrian-friendly seabed was one of the great feats of the day.Sure you can argue that when Christian Bale - playing a more haunted hungry Moses in Ridley Scotts Exodus Gods and Kings - points his dubious minions straight toward the churning waves as Ramses and his chariots barrel around the bend in pursuit the gyring funnels and flashes of lightning and the sideways reverse tsunami look slicker and more lifelike than DeMilles. But its the kind of CG-driven visual effect weve grown accustomed to in Transformer movies and Godzilla movies and Middle-earth movies.Parting the Red Sea? Thats what fractal landscaping motion capture and bidirectional texture function can do. Computer-generated imaging has advanced spectacularly over the decades but moviegoers and gamers have been there every step of the way. Miracles arent as impressive as they used to be.Which in Exodus Gods and Kings leaves us back with the basics the screenplay the stars the 1300 B.C. couture. When Ramses (a shiny-domed eyelinered Joel Edgerton) and adoptive brother Moses lead their preemptive strike against the Hittites Scott brings the camera close in to catch the respective glints of courage (Moses) and uh-oh (Ramses) in their eyes then pulls back to reveal the virtual armies going at one another. This tactic - first the close-up the human scale then the wide CG shot of teeming throngs amid grand edifices - is repeated over and over through the 21/2 hours of stultifying Old Testament reenactments.If theres anything daring in Scott and his screenwriters take on this oft-told tale (DreamWorks Animations The Prince of Egypt a cartoon version came out in 1998 - way more fun) its the decision to depict God or his earthly iteration as a bratty kid with an English accent. As Moses struggles with issues of faith madness and spousal neglect (he marries the tribeswoman Zipporah - MarAa Valverde - and then takes off to lead the slave rebellion) this pint-size Brit (Isaac Andrews) challenges Moses to rise to the occasion. The lad warns the beleaguered Hebrew of the coming plagues browbeats him taunts him. If you want a less portentous title for this big and curious cinematic endeavor The Prophet and the Pip-squeak could work nicely.As for Bale he seems to have lost his compass. His accent strays his famous intensity wasted on clunky dialogue. (""Ready yourselves we cross here"") Edgerton is a one-note Ramses and other cast members - Ben Kingsley as the Pithomite who tells Moses of his true heritage Sigourney Weaver as the Egyptian queen John Turturro as a mover-and-shaker in the pharaohs court - serve an odd and unintended function. That is they become objects in a Name That Star guessing game I know that actor in the robe and sandals that actress beneath the gold headgear and glammy makeup - come on who is it?And wait isnt that Breaking Bads Jesse Pinkman over there in the beard and long hair getting whipped by one of the pharaohs soldiers? You betcha. Exodus Gods and Kings  (Out of four stars) Directed by Ridley Scott. With Christian Bale Joel Edgerton Ben Kingsley John Turturro MarAa Valverde.

Twentieth Century Fox Twentieth Century Fox Twentieth Century Fox Exodus Gods and Kings    (out of five) Director Ridley Scott Cast Christian Bale Joel Edgerton Aaron Paul Rated PG-13 (violence including battle sequences intense images) Running time 142 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 736am on Wednesday Dec. 24 2014 Wednesday Dec. 24 2014 Thursday Dec. 11 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are scenes in Ridley Scotts biblical epic Exodus Gods and Kings when a viewer might be forgiven for thinking God parted the waters near the Sydney Opera House not the Red Sea. Two of the main characters the pharoah Ramses and conniving high-ranking Egyptian Hegep are played by Australian actors Joel Edgerton and Ben Mendelsohn.Of course ancient-world dramas from The Ten Commandments to the TV series Spartacus have never been known for anything approaching cultural authenticity in casting. Besides what would Bible movies be without Charlton Heston?But Edgerton and Mendelsohn so good in many other films seem especially out of place in Scotts splashy 3-D take on the Moses story and theyre emblematic of a movie that tries to get by on star wattage cool casting -- hey isnt that Breaking Bads Aaron Paul as Joshua? -- and savvy special effects. The result is a movie that is often gorgeous but stiff and has little new to add to a story that everyone knows so well.Moses (Christian Bale in his usual brooding mode) and Ramses are brothers of sorts. Though adopted at a very young age by Ramses royal father Seti (John Turturro) Moses is part of the family. In fact Seti confides that he sees the stouthearted Moses as more of a son than the ambitious but callow Ramses. Its Moses who is a virtual killing machine in a battle with the Hittites at the films start.But then events start happening to make Moses realize that fate has something in mind for him other than wallowing in the lap of Egyptian luxury. Nun (Ben Kingsley) the leader of a local Jewish tribe tells Moses that hes really Hebrew and needs to accept his true identity. Add that whole God-speaking-to-him thing -- here in the form of a very angry child with a British accent -- about liberating his people and Moses can forget his previously privileged life.Ultimately Moses and Ramses become enemies culminating in one of the movies best scenes the parting of the Red Sea with its roaring incoming tide that saved the Jews and doomed the Egyptians.If Exodus which has four credited screenwriters had plumbed deeper into the anguish that must have been plaguing Moses throughout this ordeal or had been more successful as a battle of wills between two men who once saw themselves as brothers it might have had more urgency and currency as a drama.Having said that the effects are terrific though 3-D isnt necessary. When the waters lapping at the palaces edge run bright red with blood -- after an invasion of giant hungry crocodiles has turned local fishermen into lunch -- its an amazing sight. And thats just the beginning Next come toads flies locusts pustules and the first Passover in which the first-born of all Egyptian families were killed.But an even better special effect would have been having a main cast that actually reflects the Mediterranean/North African desert environment of which they are supposedly a part. There are darker-skinned actors on the screen though they just happen to be all slaves servants and soldiers. (Kudos to Scott though for using Iraqi-born Danish actor Dar Salim as one of Ramses lieutenants; he deserves more exposure.)While Bale and Kingsley pass muster too often Edgerton Mendelsohn Paul and Sigourney Weaver look like theyre playing dress-up.Hollywood has come some distance since the days of Heston. But apparently not far enough. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox TM and (c) 2014 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation MOVIE REVIEW Exodus Gods and Kings Running time 144 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sanitized violence). At the E-Walk the Orpheum others. Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods and Kings is an utterly clueless relentlessly grim and rambling action epic guaranteed to displease devout Jews Christians and Muslims alike amuse atheists -- and generally bore everyone. Poorly acted and badly written with uninspired direction and cheesy special effects ""Exodus also has such dimly lit scenes that when viewed in 3-D look like youre watching the whole mess through a dirty fish tank. Its hard to imagine exactly who Scott and his committee of writers thought they were making this movie for -- its neither Oscar bait satisfying popcorn fare nor a remotely faithful rendering of Scripture. Of the many plagues visited upon Egypt and invoked in the Passover Seder none included giant alligators as this film would have it. Even more problematic is the films representation of God not as a burning bush though one is briefly seen but as a petulant 11-year-old boy (Isaac Andrews) with an English accent. A wooden Christian Bale makes for a largely passive and mopey Moses pleading with his Egyptian brother the heavily guy-linered Ramses II (Joel Edgerton) to set his people free after Moses learns hes actually descended from Jewish slaves. ""From an economic standpoint alone what youre asking is problematic "" the pharaoh replies in one of the films many anachronistic howlers. Scott has made a vividly exciting historical film (""Gladiator) and even a thoughtful one (""Kingdom of Heaven) but ""Exodus manages to be neither. The characters are paper-thin and some fine actors (Ben Kingsley Sigourney Weaver Ben Mendelsohn and a wildly miscast John Turturro as Ramses pharaoh dad and predecessor) have little to do except deliver the odd line of silly exposition. Aaron Paul and Maria Valverde pop up in thankless roles as respectively a spray-tanned Joshua and the wife (mysteriously called Sefora instead of Zipporah) of the long-absent Moses. ""Exodus has rightly been criticized for the racially insensitive casting of its mostly white leads but thats only one of many problems with this 160 million dud which is far less involving and visually inventive than Darren Aronofskys recent ""Noah. Ridley Scott confers on-set with Sigourney Weaver who portrays Tuya.Photo Kerry Brown TM and (c) 2014 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Its also tons less fun than Cecil B. DeMilles campy ""The Ten Commandments (1956) which had a pair of vastly more charismatic leads in Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner as Moses and Ramses. ""Exodus is 78 minutes shorter than C.B.s telling -- Scott leaves out baby Moses romantic intrigues in the palace and that Jewish orgy that so displeases Moses among other things -- but the film manages to feel much much longer. The pace picks up a bit during the seven plagues though overdoing the not-great special effects eventually has a numbing effect -- and the long shots of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis look awfully fake. Youd think CGI would make it easy to part the Red Sea which was achieved with mechanical effects in 1956. Well not if you pointlessly try to pass off that parting as caused by a tsunami -- especially one much less impressive than the one rendered in ""Interstellar. ""Exodus Gods and Kings ends with a whimper as an aged Moses -- who in the Gospel According to Scott even has to carve his own Ten Commandments dictated by that petulant 11-year-old -- rides in a wagon through the desert with the Ark of the Convent. Spoiler It but not Moses will reappear in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Exodus Gods and Kings (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Exodus Gods and Kings (PG-13) Ridley Scotts Biblical epic is dazzling but hollow. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/11/2014 Editor rating 2 In interviews director Ridley Scott (Prometheus Alien Kingdom of Heaven) says he doesnt think of himself as a filmmaker. Instead he describes himself as a creator of worlds. Sometimes though he forgets to populate them with interesting characters which is the case with Exodus Gods and Kings his take on the Biblical story of Moses and the liberation of the Jewish slaves from Egypt. Scott uses lots of practical sets and locations instead of green screen to give the grandeur a tactile feel. When the 10 plagues descend on Egypt your eye cant tell the difference between whats real and whats not (Scott also comes up with a horrifying addition to explain why the river Nile turned red). If 1956s The Ten Commandments wowed audiences in its time Exodus Gods and Kings repeats the feat for todays more sophisticated and savvy audiences. There are moments in the movie when you cant believe your eyes. Unfortunately there are just as many moments that make you wince beginning with the opening scene in which an adult Moses (Christian Bale) yet unaware of his true identity and his best friend Ramses (Joel Edgerton) stand before the elder Pharaoh (John Turturro) while Sigourney Weaver looks on quietly from a corner. The make-up department went overboard with the eyeliner to make these Caucasian actors look Egyptian so the scene is unintentionally funny. Its a themed costume party full of celebrities in outrageous costumes standing around awkwardly in a lavish palace waiting for the DJ to start spinning some tunes. The rocky relationship between Moses and Ramses which was well played by Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner in the 1956 version comes off as more of a tiff between brothers than a rivalry that will change the world forever. Bale is miscast here -- he doesnt have the gravity or presence to play Moses -- and he has a tendency to mangle the scripts often creaky dialogue. Edgerton fares worse; hes apparently more concerned with how he looks than with giving Ramses inner fire and rage. Scott is too busy with the style and look of the picture which was shot by the great Dariusz Wolski to pay much attention to the psychology of his characters. He lets the Old Testament do the heavy lifting for him but thats not enough to make us invested emotionally in the story. Fortunately Scott is eager to get to the plagues as quickly as possible and after God appears to Moses in the form of a little boy (a burning bush is also briefly glimpsed) Exodus Gods and Kings turns into an enormous disaster movie in which the computer-generated illusions are seamless no matter how hard you look. The use of 3D some of the best Ive seen adds dimension and depth to the images and even though the havoc the plagues wreak is enormous you watch them with dazzled delight. Even the parting of the Red Sea the signature (and cheesy) sequence from the Heston movie has been cleverly reworked and rethought to avoid hokeyness. An underwater shot of an army of men and their horses drowning as they descend to the bottom of the sea is lovely a lyrical haunting image of unsparing death. Exodus Gods and Kings stops short of showing us the aged Moses reciting the Ten Commandments because Scott knows by this point his movie has peaked and that critical moment would come off as an extended epilogue. Besides it wouldnt make for exciting visuals which is what seems to be driving the filmmaker this time around. In Noah released earlier this year Darren Aronofsky found a way to honor the Bible while still making the movie his own. In Exodus Gods and Kings Scott settles for sticking (mostly) to the Book skipping the boring parts in order to dish out the razzle-dazzle. This is spectacular entertainment practically a theme park ride that could have used more spirituality and soul.

"Exodus an epic in name only review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesExodus an epic in name only reviewA visual spectacle brought down by a clunky script and lack of focus Exodus Gods and Kings opens Friday.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Dec. 11 2014Exodus Gods and KingsStarring Christian Bale Joel Edgerton John Turturro Aaron Paul Ben Mendelsohn with Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. Directed by Ridley Scott. 146 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGDirector Ridley Scott ticks the visual ""epic"" box with Exodus Gods and Kings but leaves emotion in the dust by trading spectacle for a compelling story.The British director who so effectively helmed Oscar-winning historical drama Gladiator in 2000 fails to reach the same satisfying heights here although there is a lot to look at in his 140 million version of the Old Testament tale of power corruption liberation and occasionally faith.Article Continued BelowScott makes his intentions clear by kicking off with an opening battle where ailing Pharaoh Setis (John Turturro) son Ramses (Joel Edgerton) and adopted nephew Moses (Christian Bale) take on the Hittites from racing chariots while running smack into an unsettling prophecy about who is destined to rule.Christian Bale plays Moses in Exodus Gods and Kings the latest Biblical blockbuster.Edgerton never looking comfortable as the magnificently garbed Ramses ascends the throne as an uncertain pharaoh. He knows he wasnt his fathers first choice to rule and his reaction to rebellion among the slaves he relies on to build the kingdoms temples and cities is inevitably ruthless. Bales Moses alternately downbeat and furious is similarly unsure of himself. Raised in the palace as Ramsess brother and unaware he is the child of slaves hes slow to accept his lineage even when presented with compelling evidence from elder Nun (Ben Kingsley).His secret exposed by conniving Egyptian viceroy Hegep (Ben Mendelsohn effectively oily and never without a funky wig) Moses is forced into exile eventually settling into tribal life by marrying Zipporah (Maria Valverde).This is the only hint of romance in Exodus unlike Cecil B. DeMilles delightfully overwrought 1956 movie The Ten Commandments which included side-plots involving not only relationships but also featured strong female characters anxious to stand up for themselves.Here women barely get a spot onscreen including Sigourney Weaver as Ramsess mother Tuya and Indira Varma as a soothsayer who has a poor track record in telling the Egyptian royals what they want to hear.It takes a while for Moses to hear from God and when he does its after suffering a head wound in a landslide and through a humble mouthpiece a filthy and impatient boy (Isaac Andrews). Moses wonders if it is a hallucination or a dream. And is the sort-of burning bush behind the child symbolic or an actual event?The churning rendering of the increasingly miserable 10 plagues of Egypt that arrive after Ramses repeatedly refuses Moses demands to free the slaves -- including the addition of a new menace ravenous Jaws-sized crocodiles -- are glorious in skin-crawling effectiveness.

Despite dramatic action sequences and rich visual detail Ridley Scotts epic fails to mine the full passion of the story. By CHRIS VOGNAR Follow chrisvogna cvognardallasnews.com Culture Critic Published 11 December 2014 0139 PM Updated 11 December 2014 0153 PM Related Five portrayals of Jesus in movies through the ages Awash in spectacle biblical epic Noah impresses (B+) It cant be easy when God reaches down and chooses you as an instrument of his will. The expectations. The existential torment. The helplessness of watching water turn to blood and locusts and frogs turn Egypt into their own chamber of horrors.The flashy new biblical epic Exodus God and Kings strips these burdens down to their narrative essentials and streamlines a big thorny story into a manageable 21/2-hour blockbuster. But it forgets to pack the emotional sting. Admirably cogent even colloquial Exodus plows through its stages efficiently methodically and without much Old Testament passion.Christian Bale plays a Moses defined by identity crisis a man who knows not what he is. Cast out from the graces and the elaborate CGI kingdom of the Pharaoh Ramses (a delightfully petulant Joel Edgerton) Moses wanders grows a burly beard finds a wife (Maria Valverde) passes a few years and then in this version of the story finds himself face to face with a rather severe and demanding boy who might be God.The kid (Isaac Andrews) wants Moses to free the Hebrews. And you probably know the rest.Exodus showcases some of the reasons why biblical epics can be dicey propositions. Rather pale Egyptians and Hebrews speak in a mishmash of vaguely English accents.A visitor with a passing knowledge of the Egyptian area would have a hard time recognizing the country or its peoples here. Though it flows more freely than epics of yore Exodus still feels hidebound to Anglo expectations of a Big Important Bible Story.But this is Ridley Scott and he has a big budget. That means massive scope and rich visual detail including breathtaking shots of monuments in progress (down to the scaffolding) and combat scenes worthy of De Mille. It also means baroque plague sequences -- if youre scared of frogs dont see this movie -- and a sense of grandeur that can surprise with subtlety. The darkness that overtakes Egypt on the night God kills Egypts firstborn sons is every bit as chilling as the sight of children breathing their last.For all that Exodus never quite nails the dramatic quandary of its title -- the hubris of a king mistaking himself for a god. Nor can it match Noah which arrived earlier this year in plumbing the anguish of being chosen. Its still a good story fairly well-told. But it clearly aspires to be more and it cant muster the blood sweat and tears to pull it off.EXODUS GODS AND KINGS (B-)Directed by Ridley Scott.

Photo Credit AP / Kerry Brown advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The saga of Moses and his people. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE A throwback to the biblical epics of yore full of campy overacting regional accents and dubious special effects. Awe- inspiringly bad. CAST Christian Bale Joel Edgerton John Turturro LENGTH 130 The end seems nigh for the biblical epic with the release of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" Ridley Scotts attempt to update a creaky genre with state-of-the-art effects and a modernized interpretation of events. Actually ""Exodus"" turns out to be part of a time-honored tradition the old-fashioned super-spectacular Hollywood bomb. Filled with swashbuckling action a cast of screaming thousands a cacophony of regional accents and some of the campiest acting outside a John Waters film ""Exodus"" is the kind of hokey disaster that could have been made 60 years ago. At a recent screening titters broke out the moment John Turturro appeared as the pharaoh Seti wearing cats-eye makeup and speaking the kings English by way of Queens. advertisement | advertise on newsday Soon after came the sight of Joel Edgerton as Ramses showing off his oiled pectorals and canoodling with a cobra like Nastassja Kinski. Ben Mendelsohn plays the Egyptian viceroy Hegep as a mincing homosexual -- a trope at least as old as ""Spartacus"" -- with an exaggerated pout and elevator eyes. Ben Kingsley takes a small role as a Jewish elder; Sigourney Weaver as Moses adoptive mother barely speaks at all. After all this -- were about 20 minutes in -- its hard to take anyone seriously. Christian Bale turns Moses into a William Wallace type with clenched teeth a swift sword and a big public-speaking voice; he makes tender love to Zipporah (Maria Valverde uttering the potentially classic line ""Proceed""). In the films oddest and already most controversial twist God appears to Moses as a snotty British schoolboy (Isaac Andrews). They bicker mostly about strategy. That conceit suggests that ""Exodus"" wants to interpret an old story in a new way but it ends up sapping the excitement and grandeur from the narrative. Scotts parting of the Red Sea aims for scientific plausibility and ends up becoming an ebb tide -- the water just gradually drains away. Its enough to make you long for Charlton Heston and a green screen. 138 MoviesExodus Gods and Kings trailer ""Exodus"" closes out a year of biblical movies from ""Son of God"" to ""Noah."" This one may have just killed the genre for another 60 years.

And Ridley Scott has an explanation The almighty is actually a petulant and vengeful child who has temper tantrums of epic proportions when he doesnt get his way. At least thats how hes portrayed in ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" Scotts retelling of the Old Testament story of Moses. That God is played by 11-year-old Isaac Andrews as a bratty and terrifying pre-teen is but one absurd choice in this biblical action drama that feels excessive in every way imaginable from running time (nearly 2 1/2  hours) to melodramatic acting to the conspicuous amount of computer generation. The story begins during Mosess early adulthood and Scott has managed to shoehorn the religious narrative into his ""Gladiator"" template. Just as in Scotts 2000 Academy Award winner the film jumps right into the action with a battle between the ruling state and some barbaric rebels. In place of Romans however in ""Exodus"" its the pharaohs army in Egypt and some insurgents. And as in the earlier movie theres tension between the protagonist and future despot. Moses played by Christian Bale has been raised alongside the next pharaoh Ramses (Joel Edgerton). The future leaders father Seti (John Turturro) clearly favors Moses. According to the laws of ""Gladiator"" this means that Seti will soon die. And so it happens after which Ramses discovers the truth about his surrogate brother Moses is Hebrew and therefore hes exiled. Moses settles into banishment pretty well marrying a nice woman and fathering a son. He becomes a shepherd. But it doesnt last. During a horrific mountaintop storm he witnesses the burning bush and the angry god-child and realizes he must save his kinsmen from slavery and deliver them to the promised land of Canaan. Among the movies myriad problems is its lack of character development. There are passing attempts at humanizing larger-than-life characters as we see Ramses with his infant son and Moses saying sweet things to his wife. But theres a much greater emphasis on battles and apocalyptic images than on personal stories. In place of meaningful dialogue we get a lot of Gods retaliation the bloody Nile (in this case due to vicious crocodiles) maggots flies people covered in boils and livestock spewing blood before falling dead. Thats to say nothing of the storms with earth-swallowing tornadoes hail and lightning. The scenes may have been inspired by the sensationalists at the Weather Channel. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. In truth ""Exodus"" has much more in common with ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and other examples of disaster porn than ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" or even ""Noah"" from earlier this year. Scott has received flak from religious groups for taking liberties with the source material but he also has raised the hackles of laymen. Some questioned why the director cast white men in all the major roles in a movie about ancient Egypt and he responded that big names are necessary in order to finance a movie. He also said he believed that the actors selected were the best people for the parts. But they arent and thats true not just because of racial veracity. Regardless of his heavy eyeliner and gold finery Turturro is not believable as a pharaoh even for a second. But no one looks more out of place than Aaron Paul (of ""Breaking Bad"") as a rebellious slave. Even under long hair and a big beard he still looks like a dude from Idaho. And Edgerton who has done some impressive acting work has two volumes for delivering lines either an incomprehensible growl originating in the back of his throat or an over-the-top yell. Its understandable that people were angry about the whitewashing of Egypt. But no aspiring actor of color should think of this as an opportunity missed so much as a bullet dodged.  PG-13.

Never has the Bible seemed so paper-thin as it does in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" In its effort to make an action drama of the complex beautiful and mystifying story of Moses Hollywood has released a 3-D film long on atmospherics but with mere rags and straws of wisdom and storytelling. Its not as though theaters are so swamped with religious movies that we couldnt use another particularly a clear-eyed atmospheric epic from director Ridley Scott. Once upon a time he gave us the lean and deft ""Gladiator."" But while Scotts Olympian aesthetic is once again vast his philosophy is slight. Moses is imagined as if Scott met him on an awkward first date. Hes presented as a courageous hero then as a holy fool directed by a dour boyish deity who may be an illusion. The one point of clarity about his decades-long rescue mission is how violent it is. Its as if Moses acts were cannibalized for an expensive remake of ""Mortal Kombat."" Theres clearly nothing in the directors mind except how the hordes of thousands should be whirling and thrashing in the next chariot fight scene. He believes well never complain if we dont understand the story completely as long as theres always something interesting happening on-screen. The opening offers the first of countless aerial shots presenting the pharaohs ancient city of Memphis as if it were the dynastys haven for helicopters. That detached camera work fits the puppetry of the production. The ancient land is continually presented in glaringly thin long shots populated by countless tiny computer-animated denizens. The teeming inhabitants look as if they were put in place with digital tweezers. Feed Loader Christian Bale as Moses in ""Exodus."" Here live the old ruler Seti his ambitious son Ramses and Moses discovered by the pharaohs daughter as a foundling on the Nile and considered her own virtuous son. They are played by New Yorker John Turturro Australias Joel Edgerton and Welsh-born Christian Bale members of the most globe-hopping blue-eyed accent-challenged crew ever cast as swarthy Semites. When Spanish Maria Valverde American Sigourney Weaver and British Ben Kingsley join the conversations sound like the U.N. lunchroom. Moses considered a second-string prince by the royal clan is exiled when his Hebrew ancestry is revealed by a conniving viceroy (Ben Mendelsohn working every line for sarcastic fun). He weds a desert sheepherding wench having a son before a head whack with a mountainside rock prompts his godly visions. He returns home to lead his people to freedom triggering Ramses wrath so deeply he tries to shoot the evil eye through his generous mascara. Moses doesnt part the Red Sea have much in the way of a staff or look a lick of 120 years old when he delivers his two stone tablets. Plus looking constantly at the childish Old Testament God stand-in doesnt give him so much as eye strain let alone instant death. Dramatizing events 5000 years ago while omitting critical detail is not creative restraint. Here it adds up to flagrant voids giving us more an experience than a story. We see the films hero freeing the Hebrew masses from centuries of enslavement as Egypt is shattered by plagues of crocodiles sharks locusts cold weather and deluges of preposterous acting.

"Review Exodus follows its own path as an epic adventure - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Exodus follows its own path Review Exodus follows its own path as an epic adventure Kerry Brown 20th Century Fox Moses (Christian Bale) confers with Nun the Scholar (Ben Kingsley) in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" Moses (Christian Bale) confers with Nun the Scholar (Ben Kingsley) in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Kerry Brown 20th Century Fox) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter The ending is never in doubt but Exodus director Ridley Scott throws in a few surprises along the way ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is one film where spoiler alerts arent necessary. Both the Bible and the big screen have so prominently featured the story of fearless prophet Moses and hard-hearted Pharaohs refusal to let his people go that the events depicted in this latest reenactment will not be news to anyone.But that familiarity doesnt mean there arent surprises to be had and not always welcome ones. Gone gone gone is the traditional depiction of the Almighty as an unseen voice in the clouds A snarky querulous 11-year-old boy gets the call instead. Even more unsettling the Red Sea doesnt dramatically part the way weve gotten used to; it just kind of fades away only to come roaring back when no one is expecting it. Some nerve.As directed by Ridley Scott and starring Christian Bale as Moses and Australian star Joel Edgerton as the unbending Pharaoh Ramses ""Exodus"" is a film determined to stubbornly go its own way whenever it can. In this as written by a tribe of writers including Adam Cooper and Bill Collage and Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian it echoes its own storyline where each major character including the Almighty is more stubborn than the one who came before.

In Ridley Scotts lavish new 3-D epic ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" rivers run with blood ancient seas part with tsunami force and Christian Bale delivers a portrait of Moses as a passionate hot-tempered holy man who struggles with his relationship to God depicted as an androgynous strong-willed... (Gina McIntyre) At its core however ""Exodus"" is the kind of traditional adventure epic that weve come to expect from director Scott responsible at his best for ""Blade Runner"" ""Alien"" ""Gladiator"" and the underrated ""Kingdom of Heaven.""Scott is in many ways contemporary cinemas preeminent creator of exotic worlds and working here with his frequent production designer Arthur Max cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and an art and construction crew numbering more than 1000 he has turned the spectacle of ancient Egypt into the films most plausible reason for being. Trailer Exodus Gods and Kings ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" See more videos Making extensive use of computer-generated imagery as well as 3-D (which frankly takes some getting used to) ""Exodus"" is heavily into pharaonic color and pageantry giving us charging chariots seething crowds warring armies the whole nine yards often viewed from a gods eye overhead perspective. Despite the best efforts of all those writers however the dramatic side of ""Exodus"" alternates between being completely solemn and unintentionally silly with lines of dialogue like a snarky Aaron telling his son ""This is your famous uncle Moses"" being more the rule than the exception.In this it is not as far as it thinks from the gold calf standard of biblical epics ""The Ten Commandments"" a story that Cecil B. DeMille liked so much he filmed it twice. As with the DeMille ventures enjoyment here involves managing expectations and not taking things too seriously.It all begins a helpful opening title tells us in 1300 BCE a time when the Hebrews had been slaves in Egypt for 400 years but had not forgotten either their homeland or their god. And fortunately ""god has not forgotten them"" either.Off we go to a palace in Memphis where Seti (an incongruous John Turturro heavily invested in eyeliner) is the Pharaoh in charge. A priestess is reading entrails and announces to general disinterest that ""a leader will be saved and a savior will one day lead.""Listening with half an ear are two men who were raised as brothers the edgy but pragmatic Moses (a hard-working Bale) and Setis son and heir Ramses (Edgerton) whose sullen thuggish demeanor gives him the air of a soccer hooligan and telegraphs his future peevishness.Both men go off to battle the Hittites (remember them?) and then Moses goes down to Pithom ground zero for Hebrew slave labor where depraved viceroy Hegep (Ben Mendelsohn) is fed up with the Hebrews whom he calls ""a conniving people"" and worse.Someone who believes ""you can tell a lot about someone by looking them in the eye"" (who knew?) Moses decides to interview some Hebrews himself and one of them the scholarly Nun (Ben Kingsley) drops a bombshell Moses is a Hebrew himself and God just might have something in store for him.Back in Memphis all hell breaks loose at this news and Moses finds himself exiled into a trackless desert where he just happens to run across a fetching nomadic shepherdess named Zipporah (Spanish actress Maria Valverde) and ends up a happily married husband and father.God however has other plans for Moses including appearing to him as that 11-year-old boy (Isaac Andrew) an idea that sounds intriguing in theory but is ineffective in practice as deity and prophet bicker constantly over Moses reluctance to accept his destiny as well as the Almightys Hebrew liberation strategy. Its not a pretty picture.Finally God ends the argument by bringing on the 10 plagues which include elements like an attack by giant ravenous crocodiles that may not be familiar to the devout. But Scott is nothing if not a master orchestrator of chaos and both intentionally and otherwise ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" offers plenty of that.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------ExodusMPAA rating PG-13 for violence including battle sequences and intense images Running time 2 hours 29 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Ridley Scott Christian Bale Joel Edgerton Arthur Max Related story - For Exodus Janty Yates dresses Moses and Ramses Exodus Gods and Kings expected to champion box office Ridley Scotts Exodus casts a wide net of spectacle and family For Exodus Janty Yates dresses Moses and Ramses Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-exodus-review-20141212-column.html,200,exodusgodsandkings21,exodusgodsandkings,latimes

"Exodus review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Exodus Gods and Kings Exodus Gods and Kings Twentieth Century Fox Christian Bale stars as Moses in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" Christian Bale stars as Moses in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton star in Ridley Scotts imposing earnest retelling of the Moses story. What do the entrails say about ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" director Ridley Scotts ambitious retelling of the Moses story the exodus from Egypt the burning bush the frogs the boils the hail the commandments the Red Sea crossing and the rest of it?Not bad they say. Not great; not bad. Those anticipating a camp hoot will be disappointed. For all his reliance on digital effects director Scotts sensibilities lean old-school and he has sense enough to keep everybody on screen in the same movie working hard and earnestly and with a seriousness of purpose. And now and then some wit. Theres a lovely moment for example when Joel Edgertons petulant Ramses bids farewell to someone with a hand-wavy gesture and a snappish reading of the line ""Then ... go"" Weve got a 21/2-hour picture to get through here Christian Bale is Moses raised as Ramses brother and protector and eventual adversary. Whether by design or by happenstance Bale starts out the film with a faintly mid-Atlantic/British amalgam of a dialect. Then as the years and the hardships pass he turns into Harold J. Stone from ""Spartacus""-- a nice old Jewish man full of wisdom and experience comfortable in the knowledge that he has become the Moses we know and love the one played by Charlton Heston in ""The Ten Commandments"" the one Mel Brooks took on when he dropped those extra five commandments in ""History of the World -- Part 1."" (Bale has merrily owned up to re-watching Brooks film as part of his research.)How are the plagues? A reasonable moviegoer ventures into ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" wondering how theyll look how the locusts will swarm exactly. Folks they look good; they look right and -- in early 21st century epic moviemaking terms -- these are plausibly plausible plagues. Theres a reasonable explanation for all of them here which helps. Momentous conversations periodically grind any retelling of the Moses story to a halt but Scott keeps his head down plows through and then gets out of the way while visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang and his slave army take it on home. Biblical literalists have expressed their concern about the movies handling of God. When Moses speaks to God God is a preteen British lad (played by Isaac Andrews) with a heavy scowl and a rhetorically (not to mention spiritually) challenging way of engaging his go-to human in their mountaintop sessions. I like this idea but then Im not a biblical literalist.The script of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" comes from Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian working in various teams and shifts. Much of the writing is more expedient than inspired. If someone for example asks how long itll take for Ramses to catch up with Moses and his followers the answer will be ""Four days if they dont rest the horses."" Then comes a cut to Ramses and his men and the very next line is ""Ramses we need to rest the horses."" Latest movies reviewedOpen link John Turturro and Sigourney Weaver sport very very fine pharaoh wear as Ramses folks; Ben Kingsley brings his patented slightly unhinged gravitas to Nun the Hebrew scholar and slave leader; Aaron Paul (speaking of slightly unhinged) lends solid support as Moses right-hand man Joshua.How you respond to the totality of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" will I suspect relate directly to how you responded to Ridley Scotts ""Robin Hood"" from 2010. Square a little heavy on its feet much of that film held me even when its bigness trumped its goodness. Same with this one.

Photo KERRY BROWN / New York Times ""Exodus"" review Moses gets the Ridley Scott treatment 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Its a strange thing the process of seducing an audience into accepting something. Just moments into ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" we are confronted with the spectacle of John Turturro dressed as an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. He looks about as comfortable in a headdress as he might if a pelican were standing on his head. Then he starts speaking and its an unfamiliar English accent -- because as we all know from movies thats how the ancient Egyptians talked. Yet within a few minutes things start to change. Moses (Christian Bale) and his friend Ramses (Joel Edgerton) ride through Egypt in open chariots and the ancient city looks so magnificent -- with the monuments and the pyramids under construction -- that were persuaded to accept anything. Its not a question of believing it exactly. Director Ridley Scott has simply made us want to be there to wish we really were there and to accept his illusion as the most ready answer to that desire. And so the next time Turturro shows up onscreen we dont think ""This is ridiculous"" but rather ""Oh theres the Pharaoh again."" Call this a victory of illusion over sense but ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is a victory all the same despite its suffering from the usual December disease of being 30 minutes too long. This time fortunately the weak slog doesnt come at the end but in the middle. When Moses accepts his Jewish identity and meets his future wife feel free to take a nap for a half hour. You wont miss anything. A secular version For those new to the story Moses starts life in the privileged classes raised as the favorite of the Pharaoh and practically a brother to Ramses the heir apparent. Though ""Exodus"" of necessity contains miracles that give evidence of a supreme being the movies take on the material is decidedly secular. Thus in a way that Cecil B. DeMille would never have considered the movie makes us feel the appeal of a cushy life in a glorious civilization and what awfulness it would be to discover one was really born into the slave class. ""Exodus"" takes the proper time to lay its foundation the relationship between Moses and Ramses. Handsome brave and capable Ramses is on the surface a magnificent fellow but he knows hes not really and he knows Moses knows it. So when the rumors surface that the ostensibly Egyptian Moses was really a Jewish foundling Ramses is quick to believe it if only to get the one guy who sees through him out of town. Charlton Hestons Moses was reflexively heroic. Christian Bales Moses is more like a very decent person who keeps adjusting to changing circumstances. In the Egypt of ""Exodus"" the rulers live in splendor and the Jews spend all day at hard labor looking filthy and miserable. First Moses must find himself as one with the Jewish people and then he has to accept his role as their leader. After a strong opening and a sagging middle ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" regains its stride and surpasses itself in the last third when the God of Abraham unleashes a series of calamities on Egypt and the royal household. In the almost 60 years since Cecil B. DeMille made ""The Ten Commandments"" movies have gotten very good at creating seas of blood frog infestations and plagues of locusts. Artistic plagues But the depiction of biblical horrors is not just a technical matter. Its an artistic one and this is where having a director whos an artist rather than a technician who just wants to lob bombs becomes important. Passover for example is presented as a rolling blackness slowly covering every street and home. This is the Angel of Death and when it finally covers everything Moses can hear the wailing and lamentation from miles way -- as one would in an age where they were no cars and nights were silent. Whats missing in ""Exodus"" is religious fervor any sense that the story is not merely interesting history but something momentous wonderful and glorious. Perhaps Scott just didnt feel it and unlike DeMille felt no obligation to fake it. He should have a little. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Kerry Brown) Just ask Cecil B. DeMille The first commandment of a Bible movie is to provide spectacle not Scripture. Audiences who wouldnt pay a nickel for an hour-long religious lecture will happily line up for a three-hour Technicolor epic about toga-clad warriors and pagan babes.Ridley Scott is probably the closest thing to DeMille in modern Hollywood. Scott has already tackled ""Troy"" ridden with ""Robin Hood"" and birthed the ""Alien"" franchise so its a small step to making a movie about the most photogenic of Bible stories the exodus of Jewish slaves from ancient Egypt.""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is a handsome movie with a handsome leading man. Christian Bale is widely considered the finest actor of his generation. Yet here hes adrift in the bulrushes. This might be the most indifferent performance of Bales career. RELATED THE 10 BEST RELIGIOUS MOVIES EVERScott starts the story when Moses is a grown man the second in command to Egypts pharoah-in-waiting Ramses (Joel Edgerton). Around the time that Ramses father (John Turturro) grows ill rebellious slave Nun (Ben Kingsley) reveals to the orphan Moses that he is a Jew and the prophesied foe of the throne.""Take my word for it"" is a lousy basis for drama and ""Exodus"" rarely energizes the conflict between Moses and his lifelong friend Ramses. Even after Moses retreats to the desert to take potshots at the Egyptians a weird little-boy God steps in front of the burning bush to tell Moses ""Ill take it from here."" The plagues -- a bloody sea a rain of frogs an outbreak of boils -- are a highlight of the movie. And anyone whos interested in ancient architecture should enjoy the 3-D settings with slaves arrayed around the pyramids and statues.But while the money shot of the parting Red Sea is a visual payoff the tsunami wave churns up the bedrock problem with the movie. We couldnt care less about the characters who survive it or about Moses return to his after-thought wife (Maria Valverde) or even about the 600000 Jewish refugees who get socked with 10 rules in the hurried finale of the film. What are those rules why were they needed and why should we care? We have no idea. Whats the point of a Moses movie without a message from the mountaintop?

Christian Bale stars as Moses alongside Joel Edgerton as Rhamses. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 928 a.m. MST December 11 2014Ridley Scott aims for an epic telling of the Moses story but even with Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton on hand he never quite gets there.Christian Bale plays Moses in Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods and Kings.""(Photo Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox/AP)Story Highlights2.5 starsChristian Bale is a really good actor but even he is somewhat stiff. Ben Mendelsohn as a scheming viceroy is the best thing in the movieRidley Scott took some heat for the mostly White cast but there are other reasons to not like the film.""Exodus Gods and Kings"" has drawn fire for casting White actors in the major roles but dont get too bogged down in that.Really thats hardly the only reason to not like it.Yes Ridley Scotts casting choices are suspect with Christian Bale (Welsh) playing Moses and Joel Edgerton (Australian) playing Ramses the pharaoh with whom he is raised as a brother but eventually will battle. (Stop me if youve heard this one before; it has been told a time or two.)But the performances even from some really good actors are wooden the huge CGI effects are a distraction and the best thing about the movie is the one thing that other than the casting will probably make the most people angryGod is a kid.Moses however unlike in the 1956 Cecil B. DeMille version is not. The baby-in-the-basket story is told not seen; when we meet Moses hes a man living like a brother alongside Ramses with Ramses father the pharoah Seti (John Turturro). A prophecy says Moses will save Ramses in battle and become a leader of men and Seti recognizes that Moses is the better man but Moses is a born skeptic. He doesnt believe in prophecy or in gods. He has a self-righteous streak that will get him in trouble though when he pays a visit to Viceroy Hegep (a smarmy Ben Mendelsohn the best thing about the movie) and warns him to stop living like a king ""Youre not one.""Nun (Ben Kingsley) a Jewish elder tells Moses his real life story (see baby in basket above) and informs Moses that he is in fact Hebrew -- the very people the Egyptians have enslaved for centuries.Moses doesnt much believe this either but it nags at him. And it all comes to light when the sneaky little viceroy tells Ramses about it. (We are working under the assumption here that there is no such thing as a spoiler when it comes to Biblical tales.) Ramses casts Moses out but rather than immediately lead a revolt of the slaves Moses just kind of wanders around for a while marries Zipporah (Maria Valverde) and hangs out.Then he sees the burning bush and talks to God (Isaac Andrews) who takes the form of Malak an 11-year-old boy whos kind of petulant and unhappy seeming though his diction is perfect. Its an interesting take the notion of a child ordering death and destruction to rain down on the Egyptians. It somehow makes it all the more stark and terrifying.Joel Edgerton as Ramses in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Photo Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox/AP)Anyway Moses doesnt much seem to like Malak and Malak notes that Moses doesnt always agree with him. But they make a formidable team. This Moses is more general than prophet and he gradually comes around to believing in God of course even if he sometimes argues with him about the best course in freeing the slaves.Everything you know about the story is here. The plagues are well-done particularly in 3-D (although when everyone comes down with boils for some reason it reminded me of when the Joker poisoned the make-up supply in Tim Burtons ""Batman"" and the TV news anchors suddenly looked horrible). Scott makes a case for a scientific explanation for the parting of the Red Sea though it makes the whole thing somewhat anticlimactic. The big battle scenes are so effects-heavy and enormous their impact is muted -- you cant really wrap your head around whats going on.Scott truncates the final 40 years or so of Moses life so that all of a sudden hes an old man on the verge of reaching Canaan. Its an odd way to wind down a film but also oddly appropriate. ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is a movie on a quest to be epic but it never quite gets there.Exodus Gods and Kings2.5 starsDirector Ridley Scott.Cast Christian Bale Joel Edgerton Ben Kingsley.Rating PG-13 for violence including battle sequences and intense images.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Moses (Christian Bale) leads his followers through a tsunami in Exodus Gods and Kings.(Photo 20th Century Fox)Pestilence boils and plagues -- oh mySwarms of flies oozing pustules alligator attacks and gaggles of frogs are vividly rendered in three dimensions in Exodus Gods and Kings. And yet this biblical epic is still bland overly long and otherwise forgettable ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Those seeking memorable performances and a fresh approach to the story of Moses (Christian Bale) leading the enslaved Israelites to freedom will want to look elsewhere.USA TODAYRidley Scott has a way with water in Exodus sceneYes the word of God is rendered unto Moses in a rather unorthodox fashion but that may be the only substantive deviation from previous swords-and-sandals Old Testament films.The expensive-looking massively staged spectacle with elaborate costumes and ornate production design feels bloated by-the-book and lackluster and is dotted with risible dialogue. Ramses (Joel Edgerton sporting some spectacular guy-liner and gilded costumes) the Egyptian pharaoh and Moses adoptive brother snarls at his slaves ""Get it done faster. Or do I have to kill someone?""Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Exodus Gods and Kings tells the story of Moses working to free his people from Egyptian rule. Christian Bale stars as Moses alongside Joel Edgerton as Rhamses. Complex questions such as the killing of first-born Egyptian children as sanctioned by the Almighty are presented but not explored. Instead audiences get grisly violence and chase sequences like any other Hollywood movie.Everyone speechifies their delivery rendered in the arch British accents weve come to expect from biblical stories -- except for Bales mystifying on-again/off-again Brit-speak.Casting Bale as Moses is problematic. The Bible describes the leader as humble but Bales characterization is anything but. He storms around yet remains undefined. And for some reason he sees fit to intermittently launch into an American accent. Is that what he considers a hallmark of humility?Ramses (Joel Edgerton left) and Khyan (Dar Salim) prepare to pursue Moses and the Hebrews. Exodus is under fire for its casting and the liberties it takes with the biblical story. (Photo Kerry Brown 20th Century Fox)Exodus is long on pageantry and woefully short on character development. Perhaps the thinking is that since these are well-known biblical figures the viewer can fill in the blanks. Fists are shaken at the heavens people fall to their knees and trudging is the order of the day. But being an ancient and oft-told story doesnt require that it be plodding.The movie improves as it goes along however.USA TODAYControversy trails Exodus in journey to the screenUsually when a story falters at the start it rarely gets better. The best part of Exodus however is the middle. Bale grows somewhat more convincing mildly conveying Moses sense of conflict as he leaves his wife and child to heed Gods command to lead the Jews out of Egypt. Scenes of the mass migration -- with Ramses and his men in pursuit -- are potently rendered. Not Cecil B. DeMille-powerful but more captivating than what comes before or after.Thanks to huge advances in special effects since DeMilles time director Ridley Scott fashions a frighteningly realistic-looking tidal wave that parts the Red Sea. Still the 3-D element adds very little to the story. Chariots race toward the audience dust clouds swirl and swords whiz by. None of this feels new or fresh.Rather the saga not unlike Scotts 2000 epic Gladiator is sluggish and overlong. More attention is lavished on rich details of production design -- elaborate headdresses shiny armor and sumptuous tapestries -- than on the intrinsic value of a brisk and involving story.Attempting to appeal to both religious and secular audiences this re-tooling offers visual spectacle but is otherwise soulless and mired in mediocrity. 72 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1DhA09o",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/11/exodus-gods-and-kings/19156797/,200,exodusgodsandkings28,exodusgodsandkings,usatoday

Comments click to enlarge Exodus Gods and Kings Video Rated PG-13  150 minutes  2014 Ridley Scott made this Biblical epic the old-fashioned way casting thousands of extras instead of conjuring them up digitally and the movie works well as big-budget spectacle despite a ho-hum script. Christian Bale stars as Moses politically awakened to lead his people out of captivity and a bald-headed Joel Edgerton plays the Pharaoh first Mosess buddy but then his deadly antagonist. The movies best gimmick is presenting God in his mountainside colloquies with Moses as a sadistic little boy the kind who likes to fry ants on the sidewalk with a magnifying glass. This was shot in 3-D which comes in especially handy when Scott arrives at the plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red (and also blue I guess) Sea.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Kerry Brown) Share PhotoTo what do we owe the second coming of the biblical epic?A genre that was once as moldy as stale communion wafers has been reborn this year first with Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" and now with Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods amp; Kings."" The resurrection is partly to capitalize on the faith-based moviegoing audience and partly because the Bible offers stories suited to this blockbuster era offering both spectacle and name-brand familiarity.More than 50 years after ""The Ten Commandments"" sandals are back in style. We can only hope the trend will culminate in a seemingly ordained bit of casting Someone has got to make a Jesus film with Jared Leto.But big-tent Old Testament tales are no easy sell in times marked by both religious discord and secular disbelief. ""Noah"" was interesting because it saw the arc-builder as hero of environmentalism a protector of both morality and animals.The 3-D ""Exodus"" also refashions Moses (Christian Bale) for modern times giving us an elite action-film combatant whos less a conduit for God than a strong-minded individual whose beliefs mostly jibe with the deity who secretly appears to him. (God is seen here as an impatient child played by the 11-year-old Isaac Andrews).""Exodus"" begins promisingly with a bald John Turturro in makeup. As the Egyptian pharaoh Seti the father of Ramses (Joel Edgerton) and king to Moses prince Turturro (and the brilliant Ben Mendelsohns louche viceroy) gives the film a touch of camp a necessary ingredient to any successful biblical epic. Scott ought to have kept it up.However the director of ""Gladiator"" and ""Blade Runner"" isnt known for his lightness of touch but rather a monochrome masculinity. His ""Exodus"" is action-heavy and more interested in the sheer computer-generated scale of the airy Egyptian palaces the grotesque visitation of plagues (from the bloody Nile to the locust swarms) and the mass movements of the Hebrews.Yet after Setis death and Ramses ascendance to the throne ""Exodus"" seems to lessen in scope turning into a mano-a-mano drama between the stepbrothers Ramses and Moses whos exiled after the discovery of his Hebrew birth.For an epic there are at best only two clearly seen characters in ""Exodus"" with supporting players like Ben Kingsley (as a Hebrew elder) Sigourney Weaver (as Setis wife) and Aaron Paul (as a Hebrew slave) all but inconsequential. Let our people go?The leads you may have noticed are uniformly white which has spawned a good deal of deserved controversy not abetted by Scotts defense that his stars were necessary for financing. The skin color of the ancient Egyptians it should be noted isnt known certainly and historical accuracy is never much a consideration to biblical epics. But that ""Exodus"" chose to ignore this issue of representation -- which has a long dubious history in Hollywood -- speaks to the films general lack of curiosity. Its after spectacle not questions.""Exodus"" -- written by the team of Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian -- does indeed supply the big scenes. Slowly accepting his destiny and his Hebrew heritage a bearded Moses rallies the Israelites and leads them to the climactic moment at the Red Sea (which isnt as sumptuously rendered as youd expect).Throughout Edgertons Ramses (who in the films best image wraps a python around himself) is generally befuddled by the happenings. Bales Moses is a reluctant weary prophet. He may be the only actor who would barely bat an eye in scenes with the Almighty. Burning bushes dont impress this Batman.The most emotional moment of the film comes after it ends. Before the credits roll Scott dedicates the film to his late brother Tony Scott. It adds a tender dimension to the brotherly psychodrama of ""Exodus."" But as a self-proclaimed agnostic Scott would be better to leave Moses to a believer.""Exodus Gods amp; Men"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""violence including battle sequences and intense images."" Running time 142 minutes. Two stars out of four.___MPAA definition of PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned.

Share Tweet Every bit as fusty as Robin Hood Ridley Scotts biblical epic takes two off-beat more or less mutually exclusive interpretations of Exodus--God is a delusion motivated by Moses latent guilt; God is real but only helping the Jews because he wants to punish the Pharaohs for deifying themselves--and flattens them into 2.5 hours of digital mattes CGI disasters and scowling. If nothing else Exodus Gods And Kings makes it easier to appreciate Darren Aronofskys Noah which for all of its flaws was at least animated by a personal relationship to the Old Testament.Here in a severely bronzed English-accent version of Ancient Egypt Moses (Christian Bale) is a decorated military leader and a favorite of the aging pharaoh Seti (John Turturro) who not-so-secretly wishes that Moses could inherit the throne in place of his vain son Ramses (Joel Edgerton). Once Seti dies his widow Tuya (Sigourney Weaver white as bleached bone and not even trying to do the accent) convinces her son to exile Moses and his family on the grounds of his rumored Israelite heritage and sends a couple of assassins his way once hes far enough from Thebes. (Yes this is essentially a re-hash of Gladiator complete with a similarly paced and scored opening battle scene and a climactic one-on-one showdown that swaps in the parted Red Sea for the floor of the Coliseum.) Having escaped north into Midian Moses reinvents himself as a farmer marrying local beauty Zipporah (Maria Valverde) tending to his livestock and generally trying to forget about all the people he killed and all the Israelites he helped enslave and oppress. Then he gets bonked on the head during a mudslide and sees a burning bush and suddenly hes fidgeting to return to Egypt. So he sneaks back and with the help of Nun (Ben Kingsley) and Joshua (Aaron Paul trying his darnedest to turn half a dozen reaction shots into a character) begins freeing the Jews the only way he knows how--by turning them into an elite fighting force via training montage. The idea that Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt because of a personality-altering head injury is compelling--though admittedly kind of funny--and fits with Bales performance though its mostly unsupported by the rest of the film. As in Scotts other Cecil B. DeMille-style historical epics (1492 The Conquest Of Paradise Kingdom Of Heaven the aforementioned Robin Hood) theres a surplus of underdeveloped themes here Moses as a madman chiseling the Ten Commandments alone in a cave; God--played by 11-year old Isaac Andrews in Moses visions--as a jealous little boy who doesnt want the Egyptians to have all the cool statues; Ramses as a wannabe tragic hero who drives the slaves to rebellion by forcing them to build a temple to himself. These all get trampled by Scotts goofy literalist rationalism which tries to invent a scientific explanation for everything--the Red Sea parts because of a tidal wave the Plague Of Boils is caused by disease spread during the Plague Of Flies--while preserving a sense of Sunday school spectacle and ends up working as neither. (Scott and his screenwriters more or less give up when it comes to the Plague On The First Born.) At least DeMille knew how to put on a show; the best this offers are a few bursts of Old Testament camp like the repeated scenes of Joshua spying on Moses from behind a rock or the sequence where Edgerton struggles to emote grief while a silicone baby prop flops around in his arms.

"Review Exodus puts the epic back in biblical story - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Exodus puts the epic back in biblical storyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 12/11/2014 120000 AM PST The grandly mounted ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" will restore your faith in filmmaker Ridley Scotts ability to make visually spectacular movies. Now if only he could return to making ones that stir us in other ways.""Exodus"" is fun as a popcorn film but its not without flaws from Christian Bales awkward leaden performance as Moses to the issue of a primarily white cast portraying mostly Egyptian characters.What this 3-D extravaganza gets spectacularly right is in putting the epic back into the biblical epic. It does so in the grandest way imaginable especially when it comes to re-creating key moments from the Old Testament tale from plagues to the parting of the Red Sea. In fact ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is so impressive in the special effects department it makes ""Noah"" with Russell Crowe seem like a little indie production.While Scotts take on the showdown between the visionary Moses and the bratty new Pharaoh Ramses (a solid Joel Edgerton) fails to even come close to filling the sandals of his Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"" it is still entertaining in a blockbuster way. But youll need to be patient with it and a little forgiving. After an impressive if chaotic opening that finds Moses saving Ramses life as the near-brothers and a huge group of Egyptian soldiers storm a Hittite camp Scott and a team of screenwriters slow the pace down in telling a well-known tale. They do manage to do a fine job of showing how the jealous and tantrum-prone Ramses decides to exile Moses once he finds out that the man who saved his life is actually a Hebrew. Advertisement That comprises much of the films first half with Moses and Ramses tussling and tangling while Ramses mom Tuya (Sigourney Weaver) urges her son to get rid of Moses. Meanwhile Moses catches the interest of slaves including the distinguished Nun (Ben Kingsley) and the fidgety Joshua (Aaron Paul of ""Breaking Bad""). After his exile he becomes a shepherd in a small village and falls in love with Zipporah (Maria Valverde) with whom he has a son. The biggest problem arises not so much in these smaller roles but in Bales Moses. The usually reliable actor downplays the obsessive qualities of a mortal who gets an earful from God (who is played as a child) and is asked to make sacrifices that include leaving his family. Bale opts to make Moses more even-keeled rational even and that low-key approach gets swallowed up in a film where everything else is on such a large scale.When most of us think of Moses we flash on the bearded Charlton Heston from Cecil B. DeMilles 1956-vintage ""The Ten Commandments."" That film is considered a staple in this genre and covered much more territory. Scotts film is better at creating the look and feel of the times but it has a harder time tapping into the human story. Christian Bale as Moses charges into a fierce battle in Exodus Gods and Kings. (Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox) The biggest achievements come in the visual anchor set pieces we know well when Gods displeasure comes in the form of the plagues. Crocodiles attack Locusts swarm The Nile turns blood red The special effects shift into overdrive and its an astonishing sight to behold. It must be seen on the big screen. The parting of the Red Sea is memorable and far more realistically rendered than what weve seen in the past with water receding until that epic tidal wave comes crashing down. Scott could use a ride on that wave as he needs a big hit -- his last movies were the bland ""Alien"" prequel ""Prometheus"" and the violent incoherent some will say wretched ""The Counselor.""""Exodus"" is a step in the right direction for a talented filmmaker whos given us many iconic films over the years including the highly underrated drama about the Crusades 2005s ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (to be reminded of why hes such a legend see the directors cut version).While ""Exodus"" might not have inspired me Im still a believer in Scott and hold out hope he will make another great movie. But to do so it must be epic not only in scale but in true human emotion as well.exodus gods and kings   1/2Rating PG-13 (for violence including battle sequences and intense images)Cast Christian Bale Joel Edgerton Aaron Paul Ben Kingsley Sigourney WeaverDirector Ridley ScottRunning time 2 hours 22 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

""Now the man Moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth"" sayeth the Good Book of our hero played by Christian Bale an actor of hauteur even when saddled with a comb-over and pot belly. Bales Moses is a sword-slashing general who strides around ancient Egypt like he owns the place which as the adopted son of the Pharaoh he does at first. This guy is fated to lead a slave uprising? The only way Bales Moses could be the humblest man alive is if the rest of the planet were killed. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Of course in the Old Testament global genocide is always a possibility. In fact we saw it earlier this year in Darren Aronofskys Noah in which God commanded Russell Crowe to be an accomplice to mankinds murder. Here God -- a small tantrum-throwing boy who looks as if he enjoys burning ants -- orders Moses to wreak havoc on the Egyptians. Judging by the carnage its an awful time to be a human and an even worse time to be a horse. Pair Noah with Exodus for a night of big-budget biblical bummers that cow us before the Lords divine will and then when his back is turned whisper to us that God might be a bit of a jerk.Archaeologists have never found evidence of a huge migration out of Egypt. Yet the Moses myth (and to historians it is one) has one absolute truth It makes an expensive movie. For a story thats pro-poor and anti-wealth every frame of it looks as if it cost as much as human life itself -- and that more than any bludgeoned battle cries for freedom is the pleasure of the film. What 1923s The Ten Commandments lacked in pixels it made up for in people. Cecil B. DeMille hired 1600 laborers just to build his own cathouse of 21 sphinxes and while he had to fake the parting of the Red Sea with Jell-O he could afford to send a thousand extras scurrying through the jiggling walls.Film Details Exodus Gods and Kings RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time142 min. More Info Trailer Ninety-one years later Scott has the resources to animate a terrifying tidal wave crashing upon the enemy army. Still the best visuals in Exodus are tactile the heavy turquoise bridles worn by the villainous Ramses II (Joel Edgerton) the matching blue-and-white headdresses of his soldiers as they dominate the Hebrew slave quarters like cotton stormtroopers the zebra and tiger skins he uses as carpet and the unearthly pink crab he munches on for dinner. We can hear the luxury Even in chaotic battle scenes you can discern every individual clink of the scaly gold armor. And when Scott pans over the city after the Angel of Death slays the Egyptians first-born children you can make out each parents scream. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Alas Scott and the screenwriters spent less attention on the story. Granted the plot outline is more than two millennia old Moses discovers hes Jewish demands liberty for the Hebrew slaves and wins only after 10 terrible plagues and a chase through the desert. But Scott either from fear or distraction has no take on what the story might mean. A budget this big ensures hes gotta sell tickets to Bible-thumpers and spectacle-loving heathens alike. Yet he cant decide if making rivers run with blood is heroic or horrific -- you sense hed rather make Gladiator II Attack of the Frogs. (Thanks to a distracting father-versus-son-versus-favored adopted son plotline he essentially has.)Scott skips over the creation of the rituals of Passover and he dodges any discussion of faith deeper than side-with-this-guy-and-you-wont-get-killed. As a result Bales Moses is paralyzed. In scripture he seems to enjoy raining locusts upon Egypt. Here he whines to God that the plagues are going too far and then simply stands by after the boy-lord snaps ""For now you can watch.""Bale angered the faithful earlier this year by describing Moses as ""schizophrenic"" and ""barbaric"" but that description doesnt inform the performance. His portrayal is more like a middle manager making apologies for the boss. Meanwhile Ramses II a fine pharaoh is so slandered that Cairos Egyptian Museum should hire extra guards for his mummy.Not only has Scott rewritten history to vilify a blameless leader hes erased the Bibles most morally tricky problem that God himself made the pharaoh cruel ""hardening his heart"" to provoke an excuse to advertise His own deadly power like a cop just itching to pull the trigger. At least Edgerton has fun with the part his goofy kohl eyeliner giving definition to a face thats slick with fake tanner and as soft as fresh halva. The role is a Xerox copy of Joaquin Phoenixs Commodus with less sex and self-pity but Edgerton adds humanity and humor -- he dismisses servants like hes flicking grape seeds off his nails.Gods and Kings is an odd subtitle for a story where the two types of leaders were by definition one and the same. (To the occasional annoyance of Ramses who gripes that all his architects want to do is plan for his death.) When religion is government then faith is sedition. Its a political debate when Ramses growls to Moses ""Is this your God a killer of children?"" Moses has no answer. How much better this beautiful-looking film would be if he did.EXODUS GOD AND KINGS | Directed by Ridley Scott | Written by Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian | 20th Century Fox | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Because that pretty much sums up my experience watching Ridley Scotts eye-candy spectacle Exodus Gods and Kings an over-the-top Old Testament epic thats essentially Gladiator with God. The story will be familiar to anyone whos seen Cecil B. DeMilles 1956 Easter-season perennial The Ten Commandments or thumbed through a certain King James best-seller. But as a refresher the film opens circa 1300 b.c.e. the heyday of the Egyptian pharaohs. John Turturros dying ruler Seti is making plans to hand the throne over to his spoiled son Ramses (Joel Edgerton) and Ramses closest friend since childhood Moses (Christian Bale) has his doubts about the impetuous heavily eyelinered heir. But he keeps quiet -- a smart move since Ramses is the kind of short-fused sociopath who peacocks around the palace with a cobra draped around his neck. After saving Ramses life in battle just as a prophecy foretold Moses travels to the city of Pithom and gets a sickening eyeful of the whip-cracking brutality dished out to the kingdoms Israelite slaves. Its here that a wise Jewish elder (Ben Kingsley) tells Moses of his secret Hebrew lineage and destiny to lead his people out of bondage and into the promised land. Rumors of this true bloodline soon make their way to the paranoid Ramses who responds by exiling his friend. As Moses grapples with his existential crisis hes visited by God in the form of a petulant young boy with a British accent -- a casting choice I suspect many will find problematic mystifying or just plain laughable. In my case it was all three. Its not easy to make an ancient story feel fresh. Just ask Noahs Darren Aronofsky. But Scott and his brooding fully committed leading man (as if Bale knows any other gear) manage to carve out an intimate character study within the tarted-up expanse of a 3-D blockbuster. As ever Scott is more interested in your eye than your heart or head. Hes a visual storyteller a builder of breathtaking worlds. And the scope of his CGI-festooned Egypt is massive. The director nails the razzle-dazzle look of the movie but the tone is all over the place. When God unleashes a series of plagues that make the Nile run red with blood and set off infestations of frogs and locusts as well as an outbreak of nasty boils and pustules Exodus briefly turns into a cross between a Roland Emmerich disaster flick and a biblical gross-out film. Scott also doesnt seem to know what to do with his embarrassment-of-riches cast. There are characters like Sigourney Weaver as Ramses mother and Aaron Paul as a Hebrew slave who make flashy entrances only to vanish. And for a story set in ancient Egypt there is a puzzling dearth of Middle Eastern and African faces. Instead were given a Moses from Wales (Bale) and a pharaoh from Brooklyn (Turturro) with an Aussie son (Edgerton). This whitewashing was already dicey in the 50s when Commandments starred such decidedly non-Egyptians as Edward G. Robinson (who always spoke like he had a cigar clenched between his teeth) Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston in a cotton-candy beard. And yet before youre able to get too distracted by Exodus flaws Scott reaches back into his bag of pixie dust and whips up another grand illusion. These feats all climax with the parting of the Red Sea the biggest special effect in the history of religion. Scotts bravura version makes DeMilles once-miraculous money shot look about as quaint as a magic trick bought from a gumball machine.

(Kerry Brown/AP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 10 2014 250 PM Title Exodus Gods and Kings Film Info Moses supposes erroneously. Director Ridley Scott (222). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. You have to work awfully hard to make a hash of the Moses story. Yet thats what director Ridley Scott did with ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" the Biblical tale most memorably put on film in Cecil B. DeMilles 1956 version ""The Ten Commandments."" (There was a silent film by DeMille and subsequent TV movies and an animated retelling.) On the face of it the Moses story seems hard to ruin The parting of the Red Sea plagues slaves yearning for freedom -- its all there. But this eye-rollingly bad movie is silly sluggish and miscast. That includes Christian Bale as Moses and Australian Joel Edgerton (as Ramses II) the sort-of siblings whose rivalry must power the plot. Scott didnt mar the basics of the story Moses is introduced as a warrior of Egypt charging into battle next to Ramses whos the son of the pharaoh Seti (John Turturro). The ruler finds the adopted Moses more trustworthy than his own flesh and blood but upon Setis death only Ramses can become pharaoh. Blood brothers? Joel Edgerton (l) plays Rameses and Christian Bale is Moses his adopted sibling in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" The News gives the movie a paltry one star. (Kerry Brown/AP) Christian Bale stars as Moses -- first an Egyptian hero then a slave rebellion leader -- in the silly ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Christian Bale stars as Moses -- first an Egyptian hero then a slave rebellion leader -- in the silly ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox) Christian Bale stars as Moses -- first an Egyptian hero then a slave rebellion leader -- in the silly ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox) A sneaky viceroy (Ben Mendelsohn) eventually learns that Moses was a Jewish slaves son -- and thats all Ramses needs. Moses is banished and winds up in a village where he marries and has a son. He has visions of a stern-faced young boy who calls himself ""I Am"" as strange plagues descend on Egypt. Following the mass death of firstborns including Ramses son the slaves follow Moses across the desert until they hit a watery roadblock. Scotts staging of the Red Sea scene is technically cool but dramatically a drip. The water recedes instead of rises. The effects are naturally greater than in 1956 but emotionally underwhelming. The same goes for the Egyptian monuments the plagues and other big-ticket moments (the talking burning bush is a silent azure brushfire the Commandments an afterthought). As with Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" ""Exodus"" strives for realism amid its Biblical lore which strips the tale of poetry and power. ""Noah"" at least had scale and showmanship which this movie like Scotts ""Robin Hood"" is missing. Ironically only in its casting does ""Exodus"" recall Old Hollywood a time when John Wayne could play Genghis Khan Marlon Brando could be Emiliano Zapata and Charlton Heston could play anyone. Bale is an extraordinary actor but the guttural Batman-in-the-wilderness bit he uses here feels like a student so unprepared for a test that he just wings it. There are times when Moses smirks at his adversaries as if Bale also cant see why hes there. Some of the camerawork is grand but the poor script and bad casting ultimately sink ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Edgerton (""Warrior"" ""The Great Gatsby"") is even more out of place while Turturro Sigourney Weaver (in Egyptian eye makeup) and Ben Kingsley (as a noble Jewish leader) suffer through traditional and semi-embarrassing cameos. Its an economic reality that Scott -- whose best films remain ""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"" and ""Gladiator"" -- couldnt cast unknown but ethnically appropriate actors in a multimillion-dollar wannabe epic but there could still have been inspiration like maybe Adrien Brody or Ben Foster as Moses. As for Ramses the movie missed a chance to make ""star is born""-type headlines. Worse ""Exodus"" is ultimately undone by its horrible script credited to four people. The movies technical achievements cant drown out 21/2 hours of awfulness. In the end should ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" just be ignored? As Ramses said in the 56 version ""So let it be written so let it be done."" Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

While most of the major milestones on the Jewish calendar are observed via one-way conversation with God only on Passover do we so explicitly recite history to each other. By that logic I cant fault Ridley Scott for wanting to stage a version of this saga just as I cant ignore the fact that my dad tells the same tale every spring but much more engagingly in half the time and drunk on Manischewitz. Framing the story as a parable about how the men who lust for power are often the least equipped to wield it Exodus Gods and Kings begins in medias res introducing Moses (Christian Bale) as a reluctant hero and a nonbeliever until his past comes to light and hes banished by his adoptive brother the paranoid Pharaoh Ramses (Joel Edgerton bald bronzed and palpably uncomfortable in the role long before God starts to make his skin blister). Recalling the truncated theatrical cut of Scotts 2005 Kingdom of Heaven (but absent that movies raw promise) Exodus plays like a miniseries thats been disemboweled of its drama and imagination with a butter knife. The handful of revisionist touches that survive to the screen are enough to make you glad there arent more Instead of parting the Red Sea Moses watches it wipe out the pursuing Egyptians in a single CG tidal wave a glaring reminder that iconography doesnt endure for thousands of years by accident. The ultimate takeaway is that if you cant finance a 140 million epic about ancient Egypt with racially appropriate actors maybe you shouldnt make a 140 million epic about ancient Egypt. Scott has been raked across the coals for using star power as his excuse for whitewashing the movie but while all films compromise in order to get made those compromises are much harder to forgive in a film that feels as though it only got made because it could. Let my people go see something else.

TWITTER Ridley Scotts rendering of the Book of Exodus serves up most of the spectacular highlights of the biblical tale 2014 marks the resurgence of the Old Testament at the movies. After Darren Aronofsky turned to Genesis to unleash Noah Ridley Scott moves forward to the Book of Exodus to revisit the story of Moses. Exodus Gods and Kings is this centurys answer to Cecil B. DeMilles The Ten Commandments but it already looks to be more controversial than that pious 1956 opus. Spectacularly filmed and intermittently well acted though not quite as much campy fun as the DeMille version the picture looks likely to attract a substantial audience even if some religious leaders voice protests. Scott did a great job reviving the Roman sword-and-sandals epic when he made the Oscar-winning Gladiator. This Egyptian saga is not quite in the same league but it confirms the directors flair for widescreen imagery. Exodus has the added kick of 3D technology and it has enough eye-popping set pieces to please adventure fans. See more Ridley Scott His Life and Work Unlike the DeMille rendering this one does not begin at the beginning but plunges us into the middle of the action with Moses (Christian Bale) as an adult in the royal court. We eventually learn the backstory of how the Jewish child managed to find a home among the kings but were introduced to him as a warrior and best friend of Ramses (Joel Edgerton). The first part of the movie cribs rather shamelessly from Gladiator which began by sketching the rivalry between the emperors son and his favorite warrior. Here the aging Pharaoh played by John Turturro prefers his adopted son Moses to his own son Ramses. This tortured family drama was performed much more persuasively in Gladiator by Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix and Richard Harris. Despite an excess of mascara Turturro is sympathetic but he doesnt fit all that comfortably into ancient Egypt. An early battle scene against the Hittites modeled very closely on the climactic battle scene between Arabs and Turks in Lawrence of Arabia suggests that Moses is the superior warrior which prepares for his eventual banishment once Ramses succeeds his father on the throne. But the friendship between the two soldiers is not well established in the opening scenes so the film stumbles out of the gate. Four writers -- Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Oscar winner Steven Zaillian -- are credited with the screenplay and they havent been able to craft an elegant narrative from the biblical text. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy as when a surly Moses tells God ""Nice of you to come."" Read more Exodus How Ridley Scott Chose His 11-Year-Old Voice of God When Moses learns his true identity he is reluctant to play the role of savior and he finds a comfortable home in a remote village where he marries and has a son. But his destiny calls when he comes upon the famous burning bush and is approached by God to lead his people out of slavery.  Here is the films most controversial choice for God appears to Moses as a fierce child. Although this may offend some devout viewers its actually far more interesting than the booming offscreen voice that DeMille used in his version of the story. This divine child seems angry and vengeful rather than a benign Buddha figure but one could argue that this is in keeping with the Old Testament God of wrath. The film hits its peak in the sequence recounting the 10 plagues. The savage crocodiles were not in the Old Testament but as they attack humans as well as fish they turn the Nile blood red which is at least an ingenious explanation of how the river might have turned to blood. Frogs boils and locusts are truer to the text and are rendered in luscious visual detail. Watch more Ridley Scott Explains Why He Made Exodus Gods and Kings in New Featurette The climactic chase to the Red Sea is equally spectacular. Although The Ten Commandments won the Oscar for its visual effects the parting of the Red Sea in DeMilles film was laughably tacky. Scott comes up with a somewhat more credible portrayal of how the Israelites managed to cross the sea before a monumental storm drowned the Egyptians. This sequence is visually thrilling. The movie should have ended there but Scott and the writers seem to have felt obliged to include a few of the later parts of the story including the delivery of the Ten Commandments and a scene of an aged Moses finally arriving near the land of Canaan. But while these events are integral to the biblical story they come off here as the worst kind of anticlimax. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and production designer Arthur Max make impressive contributions though some of the aerial shots of the Egyptian capital look a little too much like CGI-enhanced sets. Alberto Iglesias score is overly bombastic. See more Jesus in Film and TV 13 Devilishly Handsome Actors Whove Played the Son of God Dont expect any acting nominations for the picture. Bale garbles a few too many of his lines but he has an imposing physical presence. Edgerton is competent but we miss the hammy exuberance of DeMilles Ramses Yul Brynner. Ben Mendelsohn however has fun with the role of the sniveling treacherous viceroy who exposes Moses true heritage. Ben Kingsley adds gravitas as the elderly Jewish leader but most of the other actors are stranded with far too little to do. Sigourney Weaver is completely wasted as Ramses conniving mother and Breaking Bads Aaron Paul barely registers in the underwritten role of Joshua. Maria Valverde is strikingly beautiful as Moses wife Zipporah but her role is just as skimpy as most of the others. No movie with such a limp ending can be fully satisfying and the beginning also falters. But the long middle section is a rousing good show.

""Its not even that good a story"" Moses grumbles early on in Ridley Scotts ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" shortly after learning of the mysterious events that transformed a lowly Hebrew slave into a full-blown prince of Egypt. Its a sly knowing wink from a filmmaker who clearly has a terrific tale on his hands yet faces a bit of a challenge in selling it to a more cynical less easily razzle-dazzled audience than those that greeted the biblical epics of yesteryear. Whats remarkable about Scotts genuinely imposing Old Testament psychodrama is the degree to which he succeeds in conjuring a mighty and momentous spectacle -- one that for sheer astonishment rivals any of the lavish visions of ancient times the director has given us -- while turning his own skepticism into a potent source of moral and dramatic conflict. If this estimable account of how God delivered His people out of Egypt feels like a movie for a decidedly secular age its searching non-doctrinaire approach arguably gets closer to penetrating the mystery of faith than a more fawning approach might have managed. Like ""Noah"" the years other nonconformist Judeo-Christian blockbuster this is an uncommonly intelligent respectful but far-from-reverent outsiders take on Scripture although ""Exodus"" is less madly eccentric and more firmly grounded in the sword-and-sandal tradition than Darren Aronofskys film and will almost certainly prove less polarizing among believers. Even with a hefty 140 million pricetag and a two-and-a-half-hour running time to overcome Foxs year-end release (opening Dec. 12 Stateside) should ride 3D ticket premiums and general curiosity to muscular returns worldwide landing closer to ""Gladiator"" than ""Kingdom of Heaven"" territory in terms of audience satisfaction and commercial payoff. If theres a controversial talking point here its that Scotts film continues the dubious tradition of casting white actors in an English-language picture set at the meeting point of Africa Europe and the Middle East. Plenty of ink has already been spilled over the injustice of yet another major historical drama ceding the big roles to Hollywood royalty while relegating blacks Arabs and other actors of color to the background In addition to Christian Bales star turn as Moses ""Exodus"" features Joel Edgerton as his stepbrother Ramses -- a transformation made reasonably convincing through state-of-the-art bronzing techniques and heavy applications of guyliner (plus the exquisitely bejeweled costumes designed by Janty Yates). Yet while these are problematic choices dictated by commercial imperatives as old as Methuselah they are also reservations one willingly suspends as the strength of the performances and the irresistible pull of the story take hold. Scotts choice of material hasnt always been as reliable as his visual sense but the Exodus account provides him with some solid if well-worn narrative scaffolding; given that weve all seen or heard some version of this story the films four credit screenwriters (Adam Cooper Bill Collage Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian) seem to instinctively grasp that a completist version would be ambitious but unnecessary. You know youre in trustworthy hands when the film begins not with an infant floating among the reeds but with Bales fully grown Moses living in the palace of the aging pharaoh Seti (John Turturro) -- one of many ways in which the script shrewdly foregoes the usual framing devices in favor of a crisp present-tense retelling. The film swiftly establishes the brotherly bond between Moses a favored general in Setis army and Ramses the proud pharaoh-to-be their intimate yet rivalrous relationship sealed by the matching swords they wear into battle. Moses shows his mettle and inadvertently fulfills a mysterious prophecy by saving Ramses life in a large-scale Egyptian attack on the Hittites an excitingly staged collision of horses and chariots lensed by d.p. Dariusz Wolski with a mix of soaring overhead shots and ground-level combat footage. Shortly thereafter Moses pays a fateful visit to the city of Pithom affording us a close-up look at the cruel machinery that has kept the Israelites enslaved for 400 years toiling endlessly to build palaces and pyramids for their whip-cracking overlords. (The re-creation of ancient Egypt reps a staggering collaboration between production designer Arthur Max and visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang supplemented by location shooting in Almeria Spain a desert backdrop made famous by ""Lawrence of Arabia."") Unsettled by these glimpses of a genocide in progress as well as by his lifelong identity crisis Moses eventually learns the truth of his Hebrew lineage from Nun (Ben Kingsley) a wise Jewish elder. Before long the secret falls into the hands of a calculating Egyptian viceroy (a wonderfully louche and loathsome Ben Mendelsohn) hastening Moses exit from the royal family and Egypt altogether. Propelling the film through these absorbing early passages is Bales broodingly intelligent Moses a cool eloquent man of reason who disdains the God of Israel as well as the innumerable deities of Egypt yet whose calm rational demeanor can also be provoked to murderous fits of fury. The story of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" hinges on the gradual reshaping of his beliefs and the healing of his fractured identity Humbled and exiled he makes his way to Midian where he becomes a shepherd and marries the beautiful Zipporah (Maria Valverde) though he has a difficult time truly accepting his place among the Hebrews and the Lord they worship. Its telling that Moses first divine encounter finds him almost completely submerged in mud literally a man about to be reformed. Purists may balk at the notion of God taking on the earthly form of a cherubic angel Malak (Isaac Andrews) whose petulant manner and British elocution at times suggest a very young Voldemort. Its a mild provocation of sorts a means of getting us to see the Lord as a skeptic like Moses would initially callous and whimsical by turns a jealous vengeful deity with a literally childish streak. Before long God orders His servant to trigger a horrific campaign of destruction against Egypt where the Hebrews are perishing in ever greater numbers under Ramses oppressive rule. At once honoring and eclipsing the showmanship of Cecil B. DeMilles ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) the final hour of ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is a sensationally entertaining yet beautifully modulated stream of visual wonders that make it all but impossible to tear ones eyes from the screen. In one of his boldest strokes Scott dramatizes the 10 plagues in a seamless vividly realistic domino-effect montage -- the bloody despoiling of the Nile (which takes a surprising page from ""Jaws"") naturally giving way to a proliferation of gnats and frogs boils and locusts -- that truly does seem to capture the intensity of Gods wrath in one furious unrelenting deluge. In keeping with the momentum established by Billy Richs editing and the superb vfx work this Moses does not return to Ramses day after day with fresh entreaties of ""Let my people go"" but instead remains in hiding watching ambivalently as the Lord does their fighting for them. ""You dont always agree with me"" God says to Moses effectively inviting all viewers regardless of persuasion to wrestle with their own conflicted impulses. Scott a self-professed agnostic whose films have nonetheless betrayed a restless spiritual dimension (particularly ""Prometheus"") seems to have been inspired by his distance from the material placing his identification with a hero who never stops questioning himself or the God he follows. Not unlike Russell Crowes Noah and rather unlike Charlton Hestons iconic barn-stormer Bales Moses emerges a painfully flawed embattled leader whose direct line to the Almighty is as much burden as blessing -- and who wearily recognizes that once the Israelites have cast off the shackles of slavery the truly hard work of governance progress repentance and faithfulness will begin. Edgerton his dark-rimmed eyes asmolder with pride and contempt makes a powerfully understated Ramses one who is not without his own measure of humanity ""What kind of fanatics worship such a God?"" he splutters amid the devastation of the final plague. Arriving at a time when religious divisions in the Middle East have become all too violently pronounced the ideal of a Promised Land ever more elusive its a question that resonates well beyond the storys specific moment. And it lingers even as the film presses on toward its Red Sea climax -- a brilliantly attenuated sequence that Scott stages with breathtaking suspense and deliberation the massive CG-rendered waves never threatening to overwhelm the fraternal turmoil at the storys core. (The theme of brotherhood torn asunder becomes unavoidably haunting when the film reveals its closing dedication to the late Tony Scott.) That central dynamic is essential since none of the other characters here registers with particular force Moses right-hand man Aaron (Andrew Barclay Tarbet) is reduced to a bit part while his comrade Joshua (Aaron Paul) gets similarly short shrift despite a memorable introduction. Elsewhere the films revisionist strategy doesnt do much to elevate the dramatic stature of the female characters As Setis calculating wife Tuya Sigourney Weaver (teaming with Scott for the third time) has little to do besides look wonderfully imperious in a Cleopatra headdress although Hiam Abbass does manage a few emotionally charged moments as Moses foster mother Bithia. As Moses and Ramses respective wives Valverde and Golshifteh Farahani serve mainly decorative functions. Although long enough at 150 minutes Scotts epic is over an hour shorter than DeMilles and key events -- including the Israelites descent into idol-worshipping chaos -- have been skillfully elided perhaps awaiting a ""Kingdom of Heaven""-style directors cut. The result feels less like a straightforward retread of the biblical narrative than an amped-up commentary on it This ""Exodus"" comes at you in a heady and violent onrush of incident propelled along by Alberto Iglesias vigorous score teeming with large-scale crowd and battle sequences (which take on an especially rich tactile quality in 3D) and packed with unexpectedly rousing martial episodes including one where Moses attempts to train his people for battle. Some may well desire a purer fuller version of the story one more faithful to the text and less clearly shaped by the demands of the Hollywood blockbuster. But on its own grand imperfect terms ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" is undeniably transporting marked by a free-flowing visual splendor that plays to its creators unique strengths Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences what to think or feel its satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief.

Reply Mike says April 24 2015 at 922 pm Exodus 31-22 KJV [1] ... Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb. [2] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed. [3] And Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt. [4] And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses. And he said Here am I. [5] And he said Draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. [6] Moreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. [7] And the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; [8] And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. [9] Now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. [10] Come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. [11] And Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? [12] And he said Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain. [13] And Moses said unto God Behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me What is his name? what shall I say unto them? [14] And God said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me unto you. [15] And God said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations. [16] Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt [17] And I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey. [18] And they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto him The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. [19] And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand. [20] And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go. [21] And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty [22] But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. ...

Niles says March 4 2015 at 933 pm The costumes were beautiful as was the cinematography and the music but this film with all its beauty lacked depth. It could have been so much more and would have been if they focused on the whole story. There was a lot of potential here with the great cast and budget to make an amazing film but there was too much focus on war scenes and not enough on the actual story.

On suffering all of the plagues including the added crocodiles and sharks I fully expected Christian Bale to shout out ""Fuck me God enough already"". Id like to see the out-takes. They would be shorter and more entertaining. Ive restored my faith in Bales acting by revisiting American Hustle. Reply The Great Satan(tm) (Th3GreatSatan) says December 20 2014 at 1041 am Fantastic movie; very well done. Reply christinajoyempowered says December 17 2014 at 1242 am This was a great review. I agreed wholeheartedly. I previously read negative reviews and I dont think those people have any idea what they are talking about. I think they just like to pretend they are knowledgeable when really they just want to sound smart. The acting was excellent-only a skilled actor can pick apart performances with any merit and I can say each cast me member was dialed in and extremely dedicated to creating riveting multi-layered performances. The script was very smart-it flowed and the 150 minutes passed like nothing for me. The discrepancies in the actual story were easily over-looked...there was plenty left out of Coppolas Godfather when compared to the novel and it would be absurd to even bring it up so why compare the book to the story in this case? And finally Ridley Scott is an amazing director. The principal actors are nearly all A-list pros. I think the most poignant aspect I can take from this film is faith. When you have faith in artists you let them do their thing. You let Scott direct you let Bale and Edgerton be amazing you let the DP and the CGI artists make it look incredible and at the end of the day you have something worth seeing. But if you want to take the power into your own hands and as a novice critic decide you can do it better yourself by tearing it apart I think you will end up going down the same artistic road as Ramses. So Im glad Variety put out this review and that it combats some of the other idiotic reviews Ive read thus far so that people have enough faith to go out and see a film that is an excellent choice for the holiday season and inspires one that its possible to still be thoroughly entertained and spiritually/intellectually stimulated.

If you want bible read the bible. If you hate god go join an atheistic cause. If you want to be entertained with education as serendipity enjoy this movie. To the degree that it shakes your beliefs a bit it has succeeded in making you think. This is the value of the movie and it does that quite well - in spite of its artistic license. Reply Bill G says December 13 2014 at 652 pm I cant believe how many people below are trashing a movie that they claim they havent seen. If that isnt the epitome of ignorance - religious or secular - then I dont know what is. I read the critic reviews with my son this evening and explained something to him. Because of the political and/or religious biases of the reviewers sometimes a negative is a positive. When I read critics trashing Spike Lees Do The Right Thing - and why they were trashing it - it gave me reason to go see the movie. As I suspected I thoroughly enjoyed it. Just bought 2 tickets for the movie tonight. This is my ""boys night out"" for my son and I. Ive seen many movies where I was an expert on the subject matter (e.g. Karate Kid) and learned to forgive interpretation and cinematic license if the film maker succeeded in reaching the audience. I bet a dinner at a nice restaurant that my son and I will enjoy and appreciate this movie. Reply Lane says December 13 2014 at 515 pm I must say I was very disappointed in this movie. It was nothing like the original Ten Commandments with Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston. Exodus was very much out of context. So all I can say is I took it to be just a movie because it sure did not depict the chapter Exodus from the Bible correctly. I must say the original Ten Commandments that was made in 1956 does a great job. Even the special effects are better in the Ten Commandments than in this Exodus movie. It is a shame that the writers of such movies want to distort the Bible. Reply Judith G. says December 10 2014 at 626 pm How sad that Hollywood hates the bible so much that it couldnt even say the word God in the movie Noah. In Exodus they try to explain the plagues and the parting of the sea as natural phenomena. Yet Hollywood makes these movies anyways so that they can take monies from the faithful. If you dont believe than stick to movies like Fast and the Furious. I may not be religious but I certainly respect those that are. I think my kids and I will sit this one out Reply John says December 10 2014 at 615 pm Unbelievers are so lame. So afraid to present the story as its written you have to insinuate that Moses is suffering from brain damage? This is the most printed Book in the history of mankind by like umpteen billion copies and somehow you have the nerve to rewrite it. Just think about that for a second. Its like..here is one of the most dramatic stories ever told but Im a coward so lets see how this plays if Moses had rickets and wore a diaper. The arrogance is breathtaking Reply JESSICA LI says December 10 2014 at 933 am I like the ANIMATED VERSION BETTER. Reply JESSICA LI says December 10 2014 at 932 am THIS a terrible movie. HERE Hollywood goes again with the whitewashing. ZIPPORAH was of dark complexion. READ the facts. Reply Loved the movie says November 23 2015 at 1112 pm My theyve got you well-trained dont they. Brainwashed to a fine degree of vapid slavish pedantry. Reply blah says December 4 2014 at 210 am Saw a preview last night. Its a poor film and woefully miscast. Some spectacle but zero emotional content or engagement. Reply Entertain Me says December 3 2014 at 844 pm When going to see a movie at the cinema I mostly want to be entertained. Sir Ridley has entertained me in the past going back to Blade Runner yes Gladiator American Gangster Robin Hood etc... The brilliant Christian Bale has given countless incredible moving and solid performances going back to Empire of the Sun. I even thought he was a good Jesus in Mary Mother of Jesus at the age of 25. He was excellent in Rescue dawn 310 to Yuma The Prestige...he has more than proven his talent in the last 25 years and gives his all in every movie so I for one cannot wait to see this movie. I even saw the Ben Kingsley Moses made for tv back in 1995...I am more than willing to give them a chance in this production that looks epic indeed. People have different reasons why they will go see a movie in the first place and for me Bale and Ridley and the epicness of this story will have me buying a ticket Peace out ;) Reply Mike says December 2 2014 at 405 pm I am concerned that like Noah there may be too much artistic license taken. If you want to rewrite history as Tarantino did with the assassination of Hitler in Inglorious Basterds the result is Pulp. Is Exodus a Pulp movie that draws upon historical accounts or is it a movie that attempts to recount the story of Moses? There is a huge difference. i would like to know what I am seeing before I see it so I can adjust my thinking accordingly. Reply wiles11 says August 17 2015 at 1130 pm Sorry This film doesnt rewrite history at all. It just rewrites a fantasy book thats fair game to all. Reply Morgan Fleur De Lys says December 1 2014 at 336 pm Quote ""Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences what to think or feel its satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief."" 1) No one asked you for your religious opinion ""to compel awestruck belief."" 2) The entire story is a fabrication. Go watch ""Buried Secrets Of The Bible"" which is free on the PBS website to get a better understanding of these key points --The Israelites were never in Egypt much less enslaved. --The was never an Exodus since there were no Israelite slaves to liberate. --The Canaanites ARE the Israelites. --There was never a Moses. Most Jewish people dont take these stories literality. Bible literalism is a weird by-product of American evangelicalism and is a fairly new phenomenon of the last couple of hundred years. Its just a bunch of fables myths amp; parable stories. ""Awestruck belief""....dont make me laugh. Reply Mike says December 2 2014 at 413 pm ...""the story is fabrication""""most Jewish people dont take these stories literally"" ""it is just a bunch of fables myths and parable stories"". You learned all this from PBS. It sounds like you subscribe to a different ""bible"" that unlike the Holy Bible is full of facts and truth. Thank you for clearing that up. Reply Jonathan says December 2 2014 at 244 am You forget that the Bible is the word of God. I am a Catholic and do not take the Bible literally. Your attempt to demystify this beautiful poetic book is vulgar. Reply IT 2 IT says November 29 2014 at 1116 pm TOOOOOOO MANY unspecial special FX. As a thrill ride ok. Scott remains an art director.

Reply Rabih Chatila says November 29 2014 at 544 pm I absolutely hate the fact that Xtian bale is playing Moses in this movie... why the heck cast a so-called ""A lister"" when it only hurts an otherwise (seemingly) great movie??? lord of the rings one of the best trilogies EVER didnt have a single ""a-lister"" which added to its appeal and greatness... we go to movies for the story and for the director not the money hoarding selfish narcisstic a-listers... why doesnt movie industry finally understand this??? Reply John T. says November 29 2014 at 350 pm ""Bales broodingly intelligent Moses a cool eloquent man of reason who disdains the God of Israel"" Yeah Hollywood...forget you. This movie will bomb at the box office. Insult your audience and then beg them to buy a ticket? Idiocy. Reply Ray says November 29 2014 at 306 pm Ham the son of Noah was the ""founder of Egypt..They were the descendants of Adam(Adahm) which when you look up the definition of Adam means to be ruddy show blood in the face. Its called a blush. King David was called ruddy. Early busts and paintings of Cleopatra show her as being ""white"". Since Ham was a brother of Shem it would stand to reason they were all light skinned as the laws of God forbid them from marrying outside their race(miscengination). So the early descendants which settled Egypt would have been termed white or caucasian or able to blush. Whats the big deal. Do some study on your own. Enlighten yourselves. And before you say Im racist do your own study. After the creation God looked at everything and said it was good. Sowho am I to argue. All the races He created and all other things-if it was good with Him its good with me. Reply mcfeagle says November 29 2014 at 724 pm Amen. Well said ) Reply secolbert says November 30 2014 at 405 am Ill take evidence over myth any day. D.D. says November 29 2014 at 244 pm Why was this possibly needed? DeMilles version still holds up. From the review it doesnt sound like the movie makes a case for itself in the presence of DeMilles. Give me Yul Brynner clutching his head in defeat any day. That was an Exodus movie. Reply pierrevwilson says November 29 2014 at 1146 am I saw it last night. EXODUS GODS AND KINGS(3D) is the greatest Epic since GLADIATOR(2000). Sir Ridley Scott and Christian Bale are at his finest. EXODUS GODS AND KINGS(3D) deserves some Oscars especially Sir Ridley Scott as Best Director. Reply niki says November 29 2014 at 1135 am When movies with big sets costumes and sets are shot on video cameras it takes you out of the story and looks very fake. Reply Enrique Godinez says November 29 2014 at 228 pm You do know that films are shot on vido cinematic cameras? And they work on the film on post production and enhances the cinematic look? They look great for example Anna Karenina that never looked fake on the contrary it looked gorgeous. Reply rocky-o says November 29 2014 at 1134 am certainly not a big fan of christian bale but love ridley scott and was still interested in seeing this until the reviewer started comparing it to noah one of the worst movies in recent years (that actually didnt star tom cruise)...seems the reviewer found favor in that flick so i dont put too much hope into this turn of events... Reply Truth Cannot Be Destroyed nfho says November 29 2014 at 1128 am You might as well cast Christian Bale as the Qing Emperor of China or as an Aztec King because Ridley Scott and Fox are playing games with history by casting European Caucasians as Egyptians eons before the Ptolomaic Greeks entered and intermixed with the black Egyptian population. The depiction of Egyptians as being Caucasians is a complete joke. Reply Everett Engbers says December 5 2014 at 1019 am Egptologists would find issue with you declaring that the Ancient Egyptians were black. Nubians were black but Egyptians were North African and decidedly Semitic. Reply nerdrage says November 29 2014 at 1144 am Then why did the Egyptians themselves depict Nubians as being a different color in their own artworks? Egyptians in red Nubians in black...ancient Egyptians looked like Turturro and Kingsley not like Bale and Weaver so the cast is still too light but a cast of Jewish Italian and Arab actors - Mediterranean types - would have been reasonably accurate. Reply Skip Press says November 29 2014 at 845 am The phrase ""skillfully elided"" sums up your review and probably Ridley Scotts movie and his general ethos. You could simply have said ""omitted"" or ""left out"" for the normal people who make up 97% of the moviegoing audience. The fact that you seem to care more for the wowing via image rather than the message of Moses aliigning yourself with Scotts normal movie mien tells me my initial impression of this movie is correct. Its mostly flash and not enough substance - Bales pronunciation and use of Americanized vernacular in a trailer gave me the initial impression. Cable. Reply Susan says November 29 2014 at 226 pm Or you know maybe the use of vernacular was intended to make things accessible to the audience. The language was probably only really formalized (and by that I mean made final AND put into formal period Hebrew) in about the First Century. At first all of this stuff was a collection of different stories in oral tradition as told by a multitude of cities towns villages nomadic groups families-Im pretty sure the Tanakh contains some bedtime stories-complete with differing versions of the same story. Very little was written down and that was mostly for the Leviim and Kohanim. (See Leviticus. All of it. Those laws dont actually apply to anyone else and they have a lot more in common with Babylonian Zoroastrianism especially temple prostitution than they do with Egypt.) Also theres a long glorious history of Jews arguing with talking back to and questioning G-d. I mean whats the point in a relationship with someone if all youre gonna do is lie there? Reply Mike says December 2 2014 at 417 pm No. If he were trying to make it accessible to the audience Moses would have texted Ramses or tweeted something nasty about him. Scott says November 29 2014 at 1021 am 97% of the audience will enjoy this for the fairy tale that it is. Reply Mike says December 2 2014 at 424 pm If you consider the Bible a compilation of many books fantasy you believe that nothing written in any of these books is true; none of the people existed none of the accounts happened and the cities and countries are fictional places. Is that what you believe? HudsonDude (pvtHudsondude) says November 29 2014 at 1142 am Mike L how can you call the bible a history book? To each its own I guess. I consider it a fantasy book movie too. I hope its good. Mike L says November 29 2014 at 1103 am How can you call history a fairy tale? So can I call events that happened in your life a fairy tale simply because I wasnt there to witness it? Unlike Moses 1000 years from now you wont even be a memory. Marsha R. Levine says November 29 2014 at 808 am Thank you Mr. Chang for a most eloquently written article. And Mr. Scott for continually gracing us with your magnificent filmmaking. Reply Constance Smith says November 29 2014 at 803 am WOW so did you like it or what?? Reply Stan Evans says November 29 2014 at 742 am Wait youre saying ""Noah"" was ""uncommonly intelligent too? With those giant charcoal briquet monsters and the nutjob on the ark routine? Uh hardly. Reply Lex says November 29 2014 at 616 am Quit reading this review when the PC Police comments about casting began. Really? I just wanted to know if the movie was any good. The reviewers credibility evaporated with his smug political arrogance on full display. Reply cc says November 29 2014 at 1243 pm What a fragile sensibility you must have I hope your pearl necklace didnt break from all that clutching princess. Reply Robert McCabe says November 29 2014 at 636 am I definitely agreeBatman is Moses I cant buy it. Reply Joe says November 29 2014 at 1059 am I love the irony of an actor named ""Christian"" playing one of the most iconic jewish leaders.

Jungle Book Sigourney Weaver Will Be Back for Avatar Sequels As a Different Character Its the kind of Biblical saga where the actors with the most lines have the most jars of bronzer in their makeup trailer If youre going into ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" thinking that director Ridley Scott is going to give the Moses story anything we didnt already get from Cecil B. DeMille in two versions of ""The Ten Commandments"" prepare to be disappointed. This stodgy adaptation creaks with solemnity -- not to mention reactionary casting choices -- and apart from some nifty frog and locust infestations even the special effects pale next to a wind-blown Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea. Filmgoers and filmmakers alike return to the same stories over and over again seeking comfort in familiarity while also finding subtle ways to upend that familiarity with technical innovations or new degrees of psychological insight. We know the specifics of the murder of Bruce Waynes parents as well as we know the Passion Play while surprise is not among the delights we take in following the exploits of either Count Dracula or Ebenezer Scrooge. The unspoken rule in all this repetition however is that the writers and the director bring something new to the proceedings whether its cutting-edge CGI or smarter dialogue or just good old-fashioned showmanship and pizzazz. Make the package exciting and were all less likely to notice the same old product inside. See all Joel Edgerton Its Christian Bale Against Joel Edgerton in Latest Exodus Gods and Kings Trailer (Video) Thats not what happens here. You know the story by heart Moses (Christian Bale) and Rhamses (Joel Edgerton) are raised as brothers in ancient Egypt with the latter set to inherit the kingdom from the Pharaoh Seti (John Turturro). The current ruler knows in his heart that his adopted son Moses would make a better heir to the throne than his own son but blood will out especially with Rhamses mother Tuya (Sigourney Weaver) vamping about and resenting her sons close bond with the foundling. Did you notice how Anglo the leads are? If you want actual Semites look to the extras and the supporting players; this is the kind of movie where the more lines you have the more likely you are to have jars of bronzer waiting for you in the makeup trailer. Anyway word gets out that Moses was actually born a Hebrew the race that the Egyptians have enslaved for centuries and he gets cast out into the world. In his wanderings he starts hearing from God (represented here as a petulant British schoolboy because when Moses is Welsh and Rhamses is Australian all bets are off) and is ultimately convinced to become a leader of the Hebrew rebellion. Also read Christian Bales Inspiration to Play Moses in Exodus Monty Python Whether or not you found the looniness of Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" to be effective at least it was an attempt to inject some life into an ancient tale one where all the characters mainly exist in service to their role in the story with perhaps a personality facet or two if theyre lucky. With the exception of Moses learning his true identity and grappling with his role in history -- which Bale does fairly stiffly -- everyone else gets one note to play whether its arrogance or kindness or humility or sadism. Also read 9 Burning Fall Movie Questions Will Exodus Gods and Kings be Blessed? Who Will Grinch Flinch? The big set pieces dont pop enough to justify this movies existence; theres a battle against the Hittites early on that has the sweep youd expect from Scott but its never as thrilling as some of the sequences in his directors cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven."" Even the parting of the Red Sea disappoints; the liberated Hebrews cross over in what seems like an accentuated low tide and lets just say that ""Interstellar"" has raised the bar on computer-generated giant walls of water. Moses liberation of his people and his leading them across the desert to Canaan ranks among the archetypal epics of rebellion and triumph but ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" never successfully captures the perils or the victories.
