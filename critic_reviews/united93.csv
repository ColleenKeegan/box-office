The planes passengers rushed the terrorists leading to a fatal crash in a Pennsylvania field. MELISSA BLOCK host It was probably inevitable that the film United 93 would inspire controversy. Some have argued that its too soon to tell the story of the 9/11 hijackings. Others say that Hollywood is exploiting the tragedy. Critic Bob Mondello says he had doubts about this movie too but seeing the film erased them. BOB MONDELLO reporting The dread you feel during the first hour or so of United 93 has everything to do with memory. The initial images are comparatively bright a crisp September morning on the eastern seaboard people drowsily heading for airports boarding planes taking off routinely. All of it terrifying in retrospect. The film restlessly cuts from pilots to air traffic control rooms to passengers and you wait for someone to realize things are not routine. The realization comes in a rush as the air traffic controllers lose track of one plane then another then a third. (Soundbite of movie United 93) Unidentified Male 1 (Actor) (As character) Which way is he heading? Weve got to get track information.. Unidentified Male 2 (Actor) (As character) Hes the he was the Newark to San Francisco flight. Unidentified Male 1 (Actor) (As character) Alright. Unidentified Male 2 (Actor) (As character) Hes going to.. MONDELLO Remember the terrible helplessness and confusion you felt that morning? Well director Paul Greengrass brings it flooding back as he lets the story unfold largely on the ground at first. And more or less in real time. He does it without ever giving you time cues that would help you get your bearings as the authorities struggle to make sense of how those blips on their radar screens relate to the burning Trade Center on their TV screens. On Flight 93 once the hijacking is in progress the passengers must put those same things together without the visuals. (Soundbite of movie United 93) Unidentified Male 3 (Actor) (As character) My wife says that there was an explosion at the World Trade Center. Unidentified Male 4 (Actor) (As character) What did he say? Unidentified Male 5 (Actor) (As character) Tell the tell the stewardess. Two planes hit two planes hit the World Trade Center. MONDELLO The filmmakers working with the passengers families have pieced together what may have happened from the cell phone calls made that morning. And while no one can be sure what happened on the plane before it crashed whats on screen seems all too plausible. From the actions of the terrorists to the passengers growing awareness that this hijacking was not playing out as hijacking always had. (Soundbite of movie United 93) Unidentified Male 6 (Actor) (As character) An explosion? Unidentified Male 7 (Actor) (As character) An explosion at the Pentagon. Not a fire. An explosion. Unidentified Male 8 (Actor) (As character) We have to risk it. Unidentified Male 9 (Actor) (As character) They are not going to land this plane. They are not going to take us back to the airport. Unidentified Male 8 (Actor) (As character) Is there any other option we have? Unidentified Male 7 (Actor) (As character) Were going to die. Were going to die. Theyre flying us into a building. Were going to die. Unidentified Male 8 (Actor) (As character) Theres a lot of us but weve got to do something. You see how low we are? Unidentified Male 9 (Actor) (As character) Is there a weapon? Is there something we can use? MONDELLO I have learned a few defensive tricks to allow me to watch very intense films. One of them is concentrating on film technique and during United 93 I worked that one hard. I registered the drums that were intensifying the dialogue the editing speed that was pumping up tension. I noted camera moves that reminded me of the directors thriller Bourne Supremacy and his reality-based drama Bloody Sunday. But none of my stratagems worked during the last eight minutes of this film when the passengers at once desperate and heroic try to take the plane back. Try not to die. As the screen went black and the shouts went silent I found myself out of breath because Id been holding it for who knows how long. Powerful doesnt begin to describe the films impact. A couple of weeks ago the argument that artists should wait to tell this story made sense to me. It no longer does. Wait and you create something for people who no longer really remember that morning. We are all beginning to file away the intensity of what we felt. And as we reduce that tragic day to politics and memorials we are starting to forget and heal. With enormous skill Paul Greengrass and his team remember and the immediacy of United 93 on screen the recognizable truth of it as experience is this extraordinary films great strength.

Those films held a clear piercing mirror to the times but will we look back and say one of them epitomized the era? I think not. Let me offer a more cracked wildly distorted reflection. May I propose ""Borat""--a movie that is at once utterly singular (no one but Sacha Baron Cohen could possibly duplicate its outrages and no one has tried) and impossible to imagine emerging at any other moment? When a comedy provokes such ear-piercing laughter--and angry cries of protest--thats a sure sign that it hit not just Americas funny bone but a raw nerve too.Why ""Borat""? On the most obvious level this faux documentary--which follows a bigoted sexist absurdly uncouth Kazakh ""journalist"" named Borat Sagdiyev as he travels across our fair land--paints a portrait of the American unconscious that we all do our best to hide. Racism misogyny and homophobia come pouring out of the mouths of Baron Cohens unsuspecting dupes and in a time of political correctness when the slightest suggestion of bias on the lips of a public figure gets raked over the media coals there was something fantastically liberating (and frightening) about seeing the national id so baldly exposed.Just as many people turned to comics such Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert for news that got closer to reality than the sanitized ""objectivity"" of the mainstream media ""Borat"" threw every notion of fairness and good taste out the window in pursuit of a lower (and perhaps higher) truth. And so we meet a used-car dealer who doesnt blink when asked if hes got any cars equipped with a ""p---y magnet""; a gun dealer who recommends a Glock for shooting a Jew; a cordial Southern hostess who bravely maintains her manners when Borat appears at the dinner table with a bag of his own feces but throws him out of the house when he invites a black hooker inside. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The ugly truths comically exposed by ""Borat"" were not unique to the Bush era--prejudice and ignorance are timeless--but they could only have come to light in a culture obsessed with acting out our lives in public. In any prior era Borats victims would have run from the camera; in the age of Facebook YouTube and ""The Hills"" it beckons one and all. The promise of fame is the cheese in Baron Cohens rattrap of a movie and everybody bites.What other film captured our mania for dirty linen so succinctly or caught our culture at the very moment when it seemed most eager to discard its claim to privacy? Whether you love ""Borat"" as the funniest movie of the decade or hate it as a symptom of the coarsening of our cultural consciousness it will be a treasure trove for future archeologists looking back on the first decade of the American 21st century. Its not just what ""Borat"" says that makes it the Bush-era movie par excellence. Its what it is.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments (1) United 93 Recommended To the credit of British writer-director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) this taut partly speculative account of the 9/11 flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field has practically none of the exploitative melodrama one would expect from a major studio release. The film cuts between the delayed Newark-to-San Francisco flight a military air-defense facility and air-traffic-control centers in Boston and New York (with some of the real-life participants playing themselves) then switches to real time once the plane takes off. Greengrass takes pains to keep events believable and relatively unrhetorical rejecting entertainment for the sake of sober reflection though one has to ask how edifying this is apart from its reduction of the standard myths. (One myth it perpetuates is that the passengers succeeded in storming the cockpit before the plane crashed.) R 111 min.

After disaster the story must be told the dead held up as witness and tribute in the hope of making sense of the obscene. The power of United 93 - British director Paul Greengrasss docudrama-style re-creation of the hijacked flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field on September 11 2001 - lies in its status as a memorial for those killed and perhaps as a cathartic experience for a still-traumatised American psyche. Indeed it should probably be seen as an emotional rather than an intellectual endeavour the world after all is far from unknowing about these things and the films ability to shed new light on them - let alone how they came about - is questionable.United 93 follows in roughly real time the 81-minute flight that left Newark minutes before the World Trade Center was hit. In a naturalistic mode similar to the one Greengrass used for 2002s Bloody Sunday we see the banal chitchat of passengers and crew arriving at the airport and the beginning of the day at FAA headquarters and several other aviation control centres including a military base in upstate New York. (Around half the film takes place off the plane with some ground staff playing themselves.) As news of one and then multiple hijackings filters through the ineffectual bewilderment of the response on the ground becomes clear. In the air we and the four terrorists await their moment.The on-board environment is realised with exceptional potency the cinema transformed into an extension of the cabin through tight compositions and muscular sound design. The low insistent score and ambient thrum of the engines have a gut impact that combines with the awful suffusive dramatic irony to make the first half almost unwatchable while the spatial lurches that signify the final struggle for control are truly sickening. As an exercise in immersive cinema the film is closer to Gus Van Sants Last Days or Apichatpong Weerasethakuls Tropical Malady than conventional narrative movies.Yet the claustrophobic here-and-nowness that makes for such a powerful viewing experience is problematic in a film with aspirations to wider resonance. Greengrass has claimed that a close examination of flight UA93 can reveal the DNA of our times; but the real aesthetic however powerful belies the fact that what we see is almost entirely conjecture however conscientiously researched (the victims families were closely involved). At the same time the self-imposed limits of space and time preclude the unravelling of the events genetic strands it makes guesses about the anatomy of a murder rather than investigating its evolutionary context. We know what to expect because we know the story not because the film proposes an argument about the forces in motion that resulted in this crisis. When the hijack finally comes it comes as a perverse relief - partly because we have always known that it must happen partly because it is the sort of thing that we see on cinema screens all the time. Once the violence starts our status as fellow-passengers is harder to maintain; faced with such a horrific alien ordeal we thankfully become spectators again. Not that those on board become action heroes; Greengrass is careful not to privilege any individuals behaviour and even draws implicit mutually humanising parallels between victims and hijackers (in their use of prayer and their hesitant ruthless violence). Some of the rhetoric that has grown up around flight UA93 presents the storming of the cockpit as some sort of principled decision to ground the plane before it can be used as a weapon - a grand-scale version of taking a bullet for the President. Here the fighting back is presented entirely plausibly and sympathetically as a last desperate attempt to live; not self-sacrifice but self-defence.Of course the danger that hapless deaths will be co-opted to militaristic ends is not new. Following Horatios plea Denmarks new ruler commands Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage... and for his passage/The soldiers music and the rite of war/Speak loudly for him. This surely is not what the princes friend had in mind. United 93 might be an insular response to a global tragedy but - taken on its own limited terms - it is powerful and sincere giving reign to pity and fear without indulging jingoism or sentimentality. For that at least it deserves applause.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"United 93 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up United 93 reviewed. United 93 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 27 2006 554 PM United We Fall Whats wrong with the Flight 93 movie. By Dana Stevens Passengers comfort each other in United 93 The response to United 93 Paul Greengrass docudrama-style imagining of what might have taken place on that doomed 81-minute flight has been almost universally one of hushed tones and murmured praise from both the left and right. The New York Post calls it a ""respectful inspiring"" film thats ""in no way exploitative or emotionally manipulative"" while the Village Voice praises its ""discretion"" and christens Greengrass ""the Maya Lin of cine-memorialists."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. This curious critical emphasis on taste which presumes that the most successful evocation of 9/11 must be the one that exercises the maximum restraint speaks to the discomfort that we still feel about representations of that dreadful day. To what extent at what level of gruesome detail can we allow ourselves to relive it? To what extent do we want to? And even if someone say Paul Greengrass can craft the ideal representation of 9/11 (the most tasteful the most meticulously researched the most ""true"") what does it avail us to watch the thing? Advertisement I hope I dont sound like a cynic with a heart of lead when I say that United 93 as grueling as it was to sit through left me feeling curiously unmoved and even slightly resentful. At some point Greengrass exquisite delicacy and tact toward all sides--the surviving families the baffled air-traffic controllers even the hijackers themselves--began to smack of political pussyfooting. What is Greengrass actually trying to say about 9/11? That it was a terrible day on which innocent people suffered and died? That the chaos and shock of that mornings events (skillfully evoked via hand-held camera and real-time pacing) kept anyone even the air-traffic controllers who watched the hijackings unfold from understanding what was going on until it was too late? Paul Greengrass has spoken somewhat portentously of the events on United 93 as constituting ""the DNA of our times."" Fine but how is the pattern of that DNA expressed in United 93? Why was this film made and why was it made now? United 93 is no Schindlers List relying on characterization and storytelling to draw viewers into identifying with an otherwise unimaginable horror. If anything Greengrass agenda is an anti-identificatory one. If the Spielberg of Schindlers List is a wheedling seducer Greengrass is a chillingly precise archivist. He never cuts away to the families of the Flight 93 passengers arriving home to listen to their heart-rending voicemail messages. He never visits the inside of the three planes that did crash into buildings that day; were aware of their fate only through the words of the air-traffic controllers some clips of CNN news coverage and one terrifying stock shot of the plane hitting the second tower. He barely even names the passengers--an hour into the movie I still hadnt figured out which one was Todd Beamer--and makes a point of stressing their utter unspecialness their glazed stares and dull in-flight chatter. The suspense such as it is is purely negative--we know in advance what will happen to Flight 93 so the maddeningly slow burn of the films first hour (Businessmen heft suitcases Flight attendants chat about condiments) serves only to torment us with the anxiety of the inevitable. As if sensing that American audiences need some break from this Spam-in-a-can claustrophobia Greengrass builds into his story a cathartic act of anti-terrorist violence that may or may not have taken place on the actual flight. Ill refrain from describing this act to preserve at least a scrap of traditional movie-style suspense. But its worth noting that this possibly imaginary attack is the only moment that allows viewers to act out their 9/11 vengeance fantasies (""Take that Osama""). In every other scene Greengrass maintains an almost maddening neutrality--a neutrality that shades at times into what might feel to some viewers like sympathy with the devil. In a late scene Greengrass crosscuts between the hijackers final prayers (""Allahu akbar"") and those of the passengers (""Our Father who art in heaven""). The scenes implicit message--that terrorists and victims alike turned to their God in those awful final moments--would seem to contradict the films ostensible mission to honor the passengers who rebelled and stormed the cockpit. Greengrass wouldnt dare say and may not believe that the four hijackers demonstrated their own twisted form of courage (a claim that in the with-us-or-against-us days post-9/11 cost Bill Maher his job at ABC) but the intercutting of the prayers suggests exactly that perhaps contrary to the filmmakers intention. Its one of the moments when his attempt to cover all bases leaves the film feeling not complex but simply muddled. In the last five years ""9/11"" has become a generic brand name for terrorism its sky-high recognition quotient useful for ginning up support for any and all manner of belligerent causes. The closest this film ever comes to a political statement--and possibly the only laugh line in the movie--is the snappish question of a beleaguered official ""Do we have any communication with the president at all?"" Greenglass may not want to come right out and say it but the audiences weary chuckle made it clear As we slog into the fourth year of the war being waged in 9/11s wake (and at least in part in its name) theres still no satisfactory answer to that question.

Related Northwest native took an emotional journey to portray a hero of 9/11 Its the big movie of the moment but will you see it? Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""United 93"" written and directed by Paul Greengrass. 110 minutes. Rated R for language and some intense sequences of terror and violence. Several theaters. Heroes come in many forms; some speak loudly some just whisper. ""United 93"" Paul Greengrass meticulous re-enactment of one of the hijacked flights on Sept. 11 2001 provides a heartbreaking reminder. We all know the stories of the brave men who joined together to storm the cockpit and attempt to take back the plane from terrorists. We even know a few of their names from that terrible day -- Todd Beamer Mark Bingham -- and we celebrate them rightfully as symbols of the very best in us. But there was another kind of heroism on that plane one that perhaps didnt make so many headlines. A woman tearfully speaking to a loved one for the last time cuts her own phone call short so as to press her phone into the hands of the stranger next to her. ""Call your people"" she says quietly. An emergency medical technician covered in blood frantically attempts to revive a fellow passenger. A flight attendant desperately calls out to passengers to buckle their seat belts; still trying to keep them safe against all odds. A man presses his sobbing wifes head close to his shoulder making sure that whatever happened they would be together. Perhaps we already knew more than we cared to about United Airlines Flight 93 or thought we did. Perhaps the wounds are still too raw to watch this film which may well screen in empty theaters this weekend. (Would I have chosen to see this film if my work hadnt compelled me to do so? Probably not.) But regardless it must be said that Greengrass was exactly the right person to make this film and his ""United 93"" is made with respect with art and with love. In ""Bloody Sunday"" Greengrass 2002 film about the 1972 massacre of civil-rights demonstrators in Northern Ireland the writer/director showed his uncanny knack for immediacy for drawing an audience so deep inside a story that you forget youre watching a movie. ""United 93"" made with the cooperation of many of the victims friends and family members has the same quality and is even more devastating. The actors disappear into their characters; theres nothing actor-ish about their work just the kind of ordinary conversation and casual clothing and slouchy posture that we speak and wear and do ourselves every day. They are us and that ordinariness becomes eloquent From these people something extraordinary came. The film isnt entirely the flight itself; Greengrass cuts seamlessly from the plane to various ground-crew locations as we watch the horror unfold from different perspectives. (Many of the ground crew play themselves. Ben Sliney operations manager of the FAA command center in Herndon Va. was the man who shut down airspace on Sept. 11; his deep-voiced presence lends the film additional verisimilitude.) We see the terrorists -- four tight-lipped men one terribly young -- waking up praying and making their way through the airport. Every detail seems heightened the blank-eyed ominous stare of a model on an airport ad the lanyard worn by an air-traffic control staffer with the slogan ""We guide you home."" In its late scenes the tragedy on the plane becomes chaotic as does the filmmaking -- the camera lurches the words shrieked by the terrorists fly by without recognition. But little moments of quiet register in the madness particularly the telephone calls to loved ones during the terror so heartbreaking you can barely listen. ""You believe me dont you Mom?"" says a young man. Its completely understandable that many may not wish to see ""United 93"" -- or might question why it even was made. But for all its shock value it is never exploitative and it has something important to say. When I walked out of the dark theater early this week and back into the ordinariness of my own life blinking away tears in the bright sunshine it felt like a gift. If ""United 93"" helps us to honor what has gone and to appreciate what is still with us then its done more than most movies ever will.

Starring Ben Sliney JJ Johnson and Trish Gates. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To talk about ""United 93"" in cold critical terms is almost to miss the point because nobody is going to watch this film in a cold frame of mind not for many years. People who see this Sept. 11 movie -- a powerful and thoughtful dramatization of the terrorist crash of United Flight 93 -- may react in various ways but I suspect all will react with more passion than they expect. I went from a baseline of placid anticipation to boiling anger in less than three minutes. [Podcast Mick LaSalle with Leba Hertz on United 93 Hard Candy and R.V.] Most of my anger was directed at the murderers depicted onscreen but some of it had to do with the way they were initially presented. Writer-director Paul Greengrass does something in ""United 93"" that invites controversy. He begins his film not with the passengers but with the terrorists praying in their rooms. Then he cuts to an American skyline while prayers in Arabic are uttered in voice-over. Later when we meet the passengers its almost as if through the eyes of the terrorists. This is a mistake in every possible way -- an aesthetic lapse a lapse in taste and judgment and something that raises the question Does Greengrass understand the moral nature of the event hes depicting? After all the crash of the San Francisco-bound Flight 93 in which the passengers rose up and fought the terrorists was not just a sad but interesting thing that happened. It was a good-versus-evil story of unarmed citizens who in a matter of minutes -- facing the most terrifying situation imaginable -- overcame their fear got organized and fought for their one slim shot at survival. In the process they spared their country a cataclysmic trauma (the destruction of either the White House or the Capitol) and became heroes. Not fake heroes not the creation of propaganda but that rare real thing. To do justice to that event Greengrass clinical and reserved approach is mainly right. The classic MGM treatment or the schmaltzy Disney treatment would have been demeaning to the reality of those people and what they did. But a proper reserve does not require and is not enhanced by an attempt to humanize the inner mechanisms of the murderers. Not only do the terrorists not deserve the dignity of being humanized in art but any speculation limited by the demand that art should make sense is bound to be inaccurate. Do we really need to see one terrorist who might be a little nicer than the three others? Even if that were true it would have nothing to do with the essential story of Flight 93 which is all about the passengers. That caveat aside ""United 93"" is a conscientious piece of work made by someone who has imagined himself on Flight 93 and has tried to do right by it onscreen. He films it feverishly. The camera is always moving probing and searching as though looking for answers or at least a chance to rest. Both pursuits are in vain. In some ways particularly in the scenes of the air traffic controllers at work ""United 93"" functions almost in the way of a conventional thriller The audience is privy to special knowledge and waits in anticipation for the characters to realize whats going on. Yet even in these scenes Greengrass brings an extra quality of verisimilitude. I was particularly struck by the authentic performance of the actor playing Ben Sliney the head of air traffic at Herndon Va. Where did they find this terrific character actor who has such authority and yet doesnt preen and seems so real? Turns out Sliney plays himself. So do three other participants at Herndon. Likewise Greengrass used the actual people for the key controllers at Newark Tower as well as for the officers at the Northeast Air Defense Sector. The difference is appreciable in terms of appearance consciousness regional speech and general atmosphere. Theres just nothing artful about it and its Greengrass who deserves the credit. These nonactors dont act the way most people do when playing themselves. They act the way people do when theyre being themselves. As for what happens on the airplane its almost too much to bear. You might think that almost five years distance has made you ready to see this but its still difficult. Greengrass approach is hyper-real. Nothing is romanticized. The camera keeps a discreet distance and the dialogue reaches us almost as though we were overhearing it. With the exception of David Rasche who plays Donald Greene the cast is made up of unfamiliar faces accomplished professional actors who are relatively unknown. They come with no past associations so its possible to see Alan Basche as Todd Beamer and Cheyenne Jackson as Mark Bingham etc. The actresses playing the flight attendants are particularly strong especially Trish Gates as Sandra Bradshaw and Opal Alladin as CeeCee Lyles. As the crash had no survivors everything in the movie that takes place on board is speculation but intelligent speculation based on a real timeline and on the many phone calls made from the plane. ""United 93"" doesnt film the legend. The passengers look stunned as though still adjusting to the abrupt change from normality to insanity. But they make that adjustment and its all the more impressive when were reminded that these were regular people who just minutes before thought they were having a regular day. -- Advisory Harrowing traumatic violence.

"Terror in real time - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Terror in real time Unted 93 lets us feel again what we felt on 9/11 -- whether were ready to or not By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 28 2006 Is it too soon? Maybe. Probably. But if were to endure the unimaginable realities of Sept. 11 2001 retrofitted into a two-hour Hollywood movie this is the way to do it.As written and directed by Paul Greengrass United 93"" turns out to be a harrowing honorable even necessary memorial to the 40 passengers and crew members of the doomed flight -- and to a national innocence that five years later seems irretrievably in the past. The movie is hard going not least in the sense of powerlessness it leaves in an audience that knows exactly what will happen. And yet you come out feeling that the filmmakers have done the right thing by these people and by this day.Maybe its something less rosy than innocence that United 93"" captures in its opening moments as sleepy passengers queue up at airport gates and four somber young men slip into line without glancing at each other. Theres a heartbreaking naivete to the pilots banal chitchat to the lazy cellphone calls of those boarding. Were witnessing the last moments of complacency.Much of the first half of United 93"" occurs on the ground as Greengrass re-creates the slowly growing confusion and panic that enveloped the air traffic control centers of the Northeast. As the title airplane taxies down the runway a controller in Boston hears a snippet of Arabic and suddenly American Airlines Flight 11 is suspect -- the first of the four planes to go AWOL. But there hasnt been a hijacking since what 1990?Word is passed to New York and to the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon Va. where newly promoted supervisor Ben Sliney is starting his first day on the job. The Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome N.Y. is alerted too but since theres a major NORAD exercise off the coast hardly anyones minding the store. This a sim?"" someone asks. No -- real world"" comes the reply.These scenes take place in dark crowded low-ceilinged rooms filled with dumpy men many of whom it turns out are playing themselves. This is both good for the movie -- the actors naturalness is welcome and whod know better what happened that day? -- and jarring for the audience as though a role in the inevitable Hollywood version is the proper reward for every survivor.If theres a hero anywhere on the ground its Sliney and his heroism takes the form of simply thinking on his feet as American 11 disappears from the radar screens and United 175 drops like a manhole cover and then someone turns on CNN because a small plane has supposedly crashed into one of the Twin Towers and then the second plane hits and everyone in the movie goes terribly silent because the new age is upon us. The final plane in the air of course was United 93 out of Newark and bound for San Francisco; after a struggle between the hijackers and the passengers it would crash into a rural Pennsylvania field. Greengrass cuts back and forth between the widening shock on the ground to the still-calm flight in the air but after the first hour he settles in the hesitant first moves of the terrorist leader (Khalid Abdalla) the slaughter in the cockpit the chaos as passengers are herded to the rear calls going out on in-flight phones bad news coming in the resolve to do something anything.We need every big guy"" someone says and thankfully the scene isnt played for can-do triumphalism as it was in Aamp;Es version back in January. Even Lets roll"" the famous line of Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche) is tossed away in the heat of immediacy. I could reel off the names of the actors but that would be very much beside the point; United 93"" has been cast for anonymity and except for John Rothman the character actor playing passenger Edward Felt theres not an oh that guy"" moment in the movie.Greengrass made The Bourne Supremacy"" but the relevant item in his filmography is 2002s Bloody Sunday"" a minute-by-minute re-creation of the 1972 Derry Massacre in Northern Ireland. Like that film United 93"" is a muscular retelling that aims for near-documentary verisimilitude. The director does everything in his power to humanize his characters as opposed to dramatizing them -- and that includes the terrorists some viewers would prefer to see demonized.The sequence toward the end as the flight plunges closer to Washington and everyone on board prays to his or her respective god is the closest to commentary the film comes and its pitched halfway between muted irony and a spooky all-encompassing bereavement. So much died that day the film implies that we still havent buried it all.Elsewhere United 93"" works hard to stay apolitical; viewers hoping for flag-waving on the right finger-pointing on the left or all-American martyrdom in the middle will come away disappointed. (As will the lunatic fringe convinced the whole thing was staged in which case this movie must be part of the government coverup too. Thats the great thing about conspiracy theories -- theyre flexible enough to fit any paranoia.) The movie eloquently sets the bar for all subsequent 9/11 stories; one awaits Oliver Stones World Trade Center"" due in August with newly sharpened dread.The one misstep Greengrass makes -- aside from the European passenger who talks appeasement like an airborne Neville Chamberlain -- is in commissioning John Powells soundtrack music. Reasonably discreet the score still gilds the scenes with melodrama by its very presence.Music isnt needed here. We know what to feel. United 93"" peels back the political rhetoric and emotional calluses of five years of war and lets us feel it again. Why? Only because people died that day and because they deserve to be remembered.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Some wondered what could be written or sung or painted or filmed that might capture the devastation and meaning of the day. Most wondered when. A few wondered whether. If as Pablo Neruda wrote ""Poetry is an act of peace"" then a cinematic accounting of that September morning was not only inevitable but necessary. But is now too soon? Can a film do justice to those who died? British writer-director Paul Greengrass answers the latter question yes definitively in United 93 the first of two big-screen Sept. 11 movies (with Oliver Stones forthcoming World Trade Center) slated for release this year. The story of United Airlines Flight 93 which crashed in a Pennsylvania field at 1003 a.m. has been addressed already by two made-for-TV interpretations. Greengrass own formidable version brings it to life -- and to death -- with a bluntness and nobility that are almost too hard to bear. Five years remove (not even) is a shallow breath in the context of history hardly time enough to grieve. But its not too soon for art to make sense of violence. Based on fact (family interviews the 9/11 Commission Report) but unavoidably fictionalized the film takes us into the cockpit of Flight 93 where terrorists praise Allah as they nose the plane toward Washington D.C. and into the cabin where passengers huddle and plan for attack. It takes us into air-traffic control centers in New York Boston and Cleveland and into the confused hubbub of the Northeast Air Defense as military commanders struggle with late information. We see in almost real time the tardy communications and deadly inefficacy of a system that failed. Greengrass is best known for The Bourne Supremacy but a more relevant precedent is Bloody Sunday his shattering 2002 re-enactment of the 1972 incident between British forces and Irish demonstrators that left 13 civilians dead. Released 30 years after the massacre the film used foursquare staging and wobbly photography to reanimate a nightmare that haunts Northern Ireland today. United 93 has much the same look same wobbly camera same no-frills staging. John Powells orchestral score intrudes discreetly with strings or a dark murmur of French horns and most of the cast you wont even recognize. A number of people including the FAAs Ben Sliney play themselves. All emerge as ordinary people grappling with extraordinary circumstances. Ultimately its a film about heroes -- Mark Bingham and Todd Beamer (Cheyenne Jackson and David Alan Basche) certainly and the others who made an assault on the cockpit. But theres another type of heroism celebrated here the accidental bravery of everyone who faced death and phoned their loved ones to whisper last goodbyes. It is this most lyrical and subtle courage that Greengrass movie honors best. Its this that brings us back to 9/11 -- not to its first jolting minutes but to its aftermath when petty divisions fell away and we became for a time unified Americans. And it comes not a moment too soon. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Nike Mens Prime Hype DF II Basketball Shoes for 30 + free...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Two words came to mind when taking a seat for ""United 93"" dread and sorrow. Credit British writer-director Paul Greengrass with not exploiting the first. Yet when the end came in a spiral and a black screen I wasnt convinced of the argument for the films necessity. After all much of the movies power comes not from our forgetfulness but from our remembering too well. Still in telling the story of the one terrorist-commandeered jet that did not hit its target on Sept. 11 2001 ""United 93"" does so much right. And here is what it does best With an eloquent but spare style the film reminds us that on 9/11 the god of small things was trumped by the god of the grandiose and false certainty. A profound glitch in monotheism not a mechanical failure ditched that Boeing 757 in that Pennsylvania field. In hewing to the events of that flight and the engulfing confusion in various air traffic control centers that morning - often with real-time veracity - ""United 93"" avoids the typical melodrama that comes with the slow build of characters in disaster films. It begins in a hotel room. A man in a white T-shirt prays. Later he and his co-conspirators hug as they head to the Newark airport. Meanwhile the crew and passengers of that flight congregate much the way we do. Theres chatter about workplace crushes and anniversary vacations business calls and the sitting around that attends boarding a plane. ""United 93"" dips into streams of lives already in motion. The title of the movie speaks to its egalitarian ensemble-driven compassion united. The cast few recognizable faces among them is mildly anonymous the way flights are. Here is a visually diverse collection of people of various ages ethnicities desires - all traveling together for a few hours. What we know of these peoples lives we learn on the flight. Their relationships to the world below are revealed in snatches of conversation with fellow passengers and in those rending generous calls to their loved ones. Once the terrorists take over the plane the passengers are herded toward the tail of the fuselage. Watching them scrunch down behind seats and run their credit cards through those frustrating airplane phones is poignant. In depicting the passengers and crew coming to terms with what was unfolding the film suggests what we all hope is true that faced with evil and our own deaths we will act. In this sense ""United 93"" is akin to last years ""Hotel Rwanda."" Only instead of one mans ethical stand we see an impromptu community spring to life. While not known for certain it is believed that the terrorists onboard Flight 93 intended to crash into the Capitol building. After the terrorists take over the cockpit killing pilot Jason Dahl and First Officer LeRoy Homer one of them tapes a photo of the Capitol on the controls. The acting is raw. A number of roles are played by the actual players of that day. Ben Sliney plays himself; he was fresh into his first day as head of the FAA command center in Herndon Va. when rumors of unlikely hijackings began building. Flight 93s Captain Dahl and flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw are played by United pilot JJ John- son and former flight attendant Trish Gates. ""United 93"" works in tandem with our memories. As the plane sits on the tarmac at Newark International Airport its easy to wish for a different outcome. Greengrass captures with impressive acumen the chaos of fragmentary knowledge. A flight goes missing. It shows up again. An air traffic controller breathes an understandable sigh when a Delta Flight and an AWOL flight out of Bostons Logan airport just miss each other. His relief is premature. Toward the back of the production notes for the film is a section titled ""About United Airlines Flight 93s Passengers and Crew."" This from Todd Beamers entry ""In junior high school his class teacher asked the children to write down the person theyd most like to sit next to. As she collected every childs paper she realized they all said Todd."" Its a mere glimpse into lives lived. And while I appreciate how good ""United 93"" is it is never as moving as those two sentences. A small thing perhaps. But thankfully there is a god for those.

Another way of putting the question might be is it too soon for this movie?It is one thing for us to have witnessed 9/11 as it elapsed on television. That was a real-world event. But what we have here is a dramatization of what happened aboard the terrorist-commandeered flight that went down that day in a Pennsylvania field with 40 passengers and crew.The English director Paul Greengrass best known for his incendiary documentary-style ""Bloody Sunday"" about the troubles in Northern Ireland in 1972 has gone to great lengths to achieve veracity. His script is based whenever possible on actual transcripts as well as extensive interviews with key officials and the families of those who died. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The cast playing the passengers and crew members were selected for their resemblance to their counterparts. In some cases such as the casting of FAA operations manager Ben Sliney - the man who gave the order to clear the skies - the actor and real-life model are the same. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 And yet no amount of research or faithfulness can obscure the fact that this is a fictionalized reenactment of an epically painful moment in our history. In the end nobody really knows what happened on Flight 93 or what ultimately brought it down 90 minutes after it took off. Handled in the wrong way - i.e. as a standard Hollywood thriller - ""United 93"" could easily have inspired revulsion.That isnt the case here. Although the film has been made with great finesse it is devoid of showbiz exploitation. Even the thumping ominousness of the score is kept to a minimum. (The workaday sounds that we hear are so much more unsettling.) ""United 93"" is about as far from a movie like ""Airport"" as you can get. The actors are not supplied with the traditional character arcs and back stories common to the disaster film genre. When Todd Beamer (David Allan Basche) says ""Lets roll"" its practically a throwaway moment. Greengrass has made a docu-drama in which the story as it agonizingly unwinds is the true star. No one aboard the plane is singled out as any more or less of a hero than anyone else.And yet Greengrass has said that these passengers were ""the first people to inhabit the post-9/11 world"" and unavoidably he confers iconic status upon them. Their very ordinariness is what gives them their stature. The four hijackers are no more singled out than their hostages. It is their ordinariness that chills us to the bone.The filmmakers are undoubtedly sincere in their desire to make a movie that dignifies the memories of the fallen and helps us understand the horrors of 9/11. But I think the gut appeal of this film is more primal than that. Even though I knew how the story would end I had an almost visceral need to see it unfold. I needed to see the terrible chaos of that day of that flight ordered into a narrative and I am sure I am not alone in this. Our misgivings about seeing this true-life scenario reenacted as a movie are trumped by our desire to know - if only by conjecture - what happened on the plane.This is not to say that watching ""United 93"" is an uncomplicated experience. It pulls you in every direction. Mixed in with the staged portions is real footage of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the devastation at the Pentagon. Passengers calling their loved ones on cellphones are mouthing words that real people spoke.Despite the ordering the film provides ""United 93"" taps into the helplessness we felt on that day. There is nothing cathartic about the movie. How can any film provide closure to an experience that is still ongoing? What ""United 93"" demonstrates as if we needed proof is that it is too soon - it may always be too soon - to sort out the feelings from that day.

Wrenching United 93 is harrowing in its realism - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees Wrenching United 93 is harrowing in its realism Posted 4/24/2006 1004 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY United 93 (    out of four) is an unflinching powerfully visceral and haunting portrait of the tragic events aboard one of the terrorist-commandeered flights on the fateful morning of Sept. 11 2001. Painstakingly researched from reports of flight recordings air traffic controllers and aviation officials as well as cellphone calls made to family members by some of the passengers it is undeniably the most gut-wrenching and captivating film released this year. What writer/director Paul Greengrass has re-created is not only the devastating human drama aboard the flight but also the reaction of authorities on land as they become acutely aware of -- and powerless to stop -- the horror of the developments. Filmed in real time and shot with handheld cameras it has the urgency and grit of a documentary rather than a big-studio movie. We will never know exactly what transpired aboard that flight but United 93 gives us an educated guess. The response of the passengers is not always courageous and inspiring; some cried or shrank from acts of bravery. But it always is riveting. Though the film doesnt attempt to soften the painful blow it emerges as a viable memorial to the 44 people on board several of whom tried to fight the terrorists. The cast is a revelation. Greengrass wisely chose to use a half-dozen of the real players to augment the sense of verisimilitude. Most noteworthy is Ben Sliney in charge of the FAAs command center who helps make the story feel revealing and accurate. The directors choice of unfamiliar actors as opposed to stars to play the passengers and crew also adds to the sense that we are watching real people fight for their lives. Greengrass was an inspired choice for a believable and harrowing depiction of that awful day. The British director created one of the most entertaining and intelligent action movies in recent memory 2004s The Bourne Supremacy and 2002s emotional cinema verite-style film Bloody Sunday a chronicle of Irish demonstrators killed by British troops in 1972. Like Bloody Sunday United 93 is palpably tense and uncomfortable to watch but nonetheless compelling. The film also is terrifyingly suspenseful especially since we know the outcome. But its not the denouement that keeps us transfixed. It is the exploration of events that lead to it that shatter our emotions and mesmerize us. (Opens Tuesday at the Tribeca Film Festival and Friday nationwide. Rated R for language and some intense sequences of terror and violence. Running time 1 hour 50 minutes.)

"United 93 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; united-93 ) United 93 (United States/United Kingdom 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli It is not an easy thing to walk into a theater and willingly open oneself to being transported back to the blackest day (at least thus far) of the 21st century. There are those who believe this movie should not be released that it is ""too soon."" I will admit to having believed there was merit to this position - until I saw Paul Greengrass vision brought to the screen. United 93 is its own most compelling defender. Theres not a whiff of exploitation to be found. This is an honest fact-based account that exists for two reasons to assure that we do not forget the events of that day and to remind us that amidst all the horror and tragedy there was still room for heroism. If not for the actions of the doomed passengers of United Flight 93 the United States might not have a Capitol Building. There are too many stories from September 11 2001 to be told in one movie. Thats one reason why others (such as Oliver Stones World Trade Center) are currently in production and more will come along in future years. Documentaries already litter the landscape; now their feature counterparts are arriving. United 93 comes in the wake of the made-for-television Flight 93. Both recount the last tragic hour aboard the plane albeit in different ways and from different perspectives. And as Flight 93 represents one of the best non-HBO cable movies to reach the small screen in recent years it would not be hyperbole to make a similar claim about United 93 with respect to movie theaters. Certainly no movie in the last two years has evoked such a visceral response. Five years ago in September most of us watched events unfold via the detached perspective of television news feeds with the familiar paternal presences of Peter Jennings Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw as guides. Here Greengrass takes us into the heart of the maelstrom collapsing the distance between the audience and the event. Greengrass style is that of a ""you are there"" documentary with hand-held cameras providing the necessary immediacy. There is minimal incidental music and what there is is used sparingly and effectively. Little known actors are employed reducing the likelihood that a familiar face will interfere with character identification. (In fact in the case of some of the on-the-ground officials appearing in the film the individuals play themselves.) Greengrass uses a two-pronged approach to the events of the morning of September 11. With things unfolding in near real-time there is plenty of ""dead space"" that needs to be filled as passengers board the flight the plane waits its turn to use the runway and the aircraft climbs to cruising altitude. United 93 fills this space not through flashbacks or other ""character building"" exercises but by taking us to FAA headquarters; air traffic control centers in Boston New York and Cleveland; and NORAD. Through the eyes of the people working in these locations we see the situations of the morning develop and understand the confusion miscommunication and misinformation that resulted in civilian and military paralysis. When FAA manager Ben Sliney finally makes the determination to close off U.S. airspace most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief. Once the terrorists act on board United 93 the film narrows its primary focus to those events. We see things unfold as they have been described in documentaries and print articles. After stabbing a passenger and killing the pilot and co-pilot the terrorists seize control of the plane and turn it toward Washington D.C. The cowed passengers huddled together in the back of the plane make phone calls to loved ones and learn what has happened in New York City. They resolve to rush the cockpit and take control of the plane - or die trying. A furious struggle ensues but before the passengers can wrest control from the hijackers the plane goes into a death spiral and crashes. United 93 ends with a view out the cockpit window of the onrushing ground then blackness. Viewers may be mid-way through the closing credits before they have recovered enough to move from their seats. United 93 is powerful not only in the way it provides hope through the actions of a few unlikely heroes but in its ability to take us back through time to a day many of us would prefer not to remember but will never forget. The film is remarkable in that not only does it do the big things right but it flawlessly captures the details. Its hard to express the growing feeling of dread the film generates as we watch the passengers take their seats and endure the routine that every flier has become accustomed to before takeoff. Its all so ordinary but we know how things will end. Character development is not a priority for United 93. We get to know these people as we might familiarize ourselves with fellow passengers on a plane - fleetingly and not deeply. Some of the names are familiar Mark Bingham Todd Beamer Tom Burnett and so on. We hear the now-famous ""lets roll"" phrase although its uttered not as a call to battle but as part of a larger comment. These are people who under different circumstances might never do anything deemed ""heroic."" But they rise to the occasion although it isnt without fear trepidation and much shedding of tears. Watching these people deliver good-byes to loved ones via cell-phones is heartbreaking. Likewise United 93 does not delve into the background of the terrorists. Other films have done that but it isnt on Greengrass agenda nor is sympathizing with them or demonizing them. He presents them as individuals blinded by a cause who dont see their fellow passengers as more than a dangerous inconvenience. Yet as we watch them gathered in the airport lounge before boarding the plane we wonder what they are thinking as they look into the eyes of people they will be killing less than two hours later. The only nod to humanizing the terrorists is that one of them Ziad Jarrah (Khalid Abdalla) is shown placing a call to someone and saying ""I love you"" before boarding the plane. Later he appears reluctant to order the attack to start. But whether that is because he is nervous or because he doubts the righteousness of his actions is not made clear. In the multiple air traffic control centers we see the routine of everyday activity spiral into chaos as one plane after another loses contact and drops its transponder signal. Lines of communication are fragmented and bad information is passed back and forth (especially concerning American Airlines 11 the location of which becomes a source of confusion). NORAD is unprepared. They cant get planes in the air. Once they finally launch they have problems getting FAA clearance to fly over Manhattan. Two of their fighters have no weapons but it doesnt matter because they are unable to obtain a clarification about the rules of engagement. Greengrass an Englishman might not immediately seem like the best choice to direct a film about an American tragedy but the results argue in his favor. He is a filmmaker with a social conscience. In addition to helming the popcorn thriller The Bourne Supremacy he also made Bloody Sunday. His vision for United 93 was not to make a political statement or to cast blame. He wanted to craft a film that would bring people together not split them apart along political or ideological lines. One should not confuse United 93 with a documentary. Although it uses the historical record as a basis for its story the dramatization relies upon Greengrass imagination for everything for which we do not have confirmation conversations between passengers facial expressions and what happened during those final confused moments. In real life we do not know if the passengers breached the cockpit or whether they merely came close. We do not know how many terrorists they may have killed. And we do not know whether the hijackers crashed the plane or whether it went into a death spiral during a struggle for the controls. Greengrass makes assumptions and its hard to argue with any of them. United 93 is a masterful motion picture. Its impact stays with the viewer; its images are hard to shake. In the years since 9/11 much of what happened that day has become ingrained in our culture. We have absorbed it. United 93 picks the scab and brings back the freshness of the wound. But the passage of time allows us to see the events of this film in a larger context. I do not use the phrase ""must see"" lightly (and there are those for whom this film may be too painful). Seeing United 93 represents a difficult film-going experience and one that should not be undertaken lightly. Its hard to imagine anyone not being affected on some level by United 93. But the value of what this picture imparts is worth the challenge of sitting through it. When I compile my Top 10 list of films for 2006 United 93 will be on it and almost certainly close to the top.

Taut visceral and predictably gut-wrenching ""United 93"" Paul Greengrass already much-debated look at Sept. 11 trades in some emotional impact for authenticity capturing the overwhelming sense of chaos surrounding that days harrowing events. The result is a tense documentary-style drama that methodically builds a sense of dread despite the preordained outcome. While media attention has focused on reaction to the movies trailer strong ratings for earlier Flight 93 TV projects suggest there will be considerable curiosity morbid or otherwise about ""United 93"" that should translate into robust box office. Indeed a certain myopia seems to have overtaken those wringing hands over the ""Is it too soon?"" question. Aamp;Es ""Flight 93"" a restrained and impressive achievement on a made-for-TV movie budget and Discovery Channels docudrama ""The Flight That Fought Back"" were major successes for those cable networks. Inevitably seeing the same events on a theatrical canvas provides an additional wallop though writer-director Greengrass approach -- from the jittery camera to the dozen or so aviation and military personnel who play themselves -- feels more determined to create a ""You are there"" sensation than to send the audience sobbing into the night. By contrast a key element of both ""Flight 93"" and ""The Flight That Fought Back"" which employed chilling snippets of real audio depicted friends and relatives of the doomed passengers on the ground a nuance this telling fastidiously avoids. Unfolding in real time once the plane is airborne for its 91-minute flight ""United 93"" opens with the terrorists rising for morning prayer and blase passengers and crew engaging in mundane chit-chat that suggests just another ordinary day. Oscillating between the planes occupants military personnel at the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) and air traffic controllers in New York and Boston Greengrass (whose credits include ""Bloody Sunday"") uses a hyper-natural style chronicling the gradual dawning that the country was facing an unprecedented attack. The controllers in fact at first can barely grasp that a hijacking is in progress musing it must have been 20 years since the last one. In perhaps the starkest moment they sit in stunned silence mouths agape when the second commandeered jet crashes into the World Trade Center while an officer at NEADS bellows about being unable to defend the entire eastern seaboard with only four fighter planes. To pound home the accuracy Greengrass sought those participating as themselves include Ben Sliney the Federal Aviation Administrations national operations manager an adviser on the film who remarkably started in that job on Sept. 11; and NEADS Maj. James Fox. Its roughly an hour into the film before the hijackers brutally leap into action slaying the pilots and a random passenger. Initially terrified the other passengers confer with loved ones on the ground via cell and air phones with Thomas E. Burnett (Christian Clemenson) the first to recognize that their flight is another suicide mission and they must band together to retake the plane. From the beginning there has been something tragic and uplifting about Flight 93 the one plane that failed to strike its intended target thanks to the passengers heroic stand. In that sense the story became a symbol easily elevated to near-mythical status through facile catchphrases (""Lets roll"") and newsmagazines eager to interview surviving relatives. Greengrass however intently delivers a raw unadorned view letting the storys inherent drama speak for itself. That much of the cast is unidentifiable only adds to the reality he is determined to unflinchingly convey. Even with its copious research the film departs from prior accounts in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways reminding us (as does a closing disclaimer) that this re-creation is just that -- based on the best available evidence with inferences and composites constructed for dramatic effect. Those qualifications aside ""United 93"" is technically razor-sharp from the editing and sound to John Powells urgent but not intrusive score. Nor is the films violence any more or less graphic than it needs to be though something is lost in the one-sided exchanges with loved ones as passengers come to grips with their likely fate and bid them farewell. As for that aforementioned closing scroll ""United 93"" carries a dedication to those slain on Sept. 11 and a note that the movie was in no way sponsored by United Airlines. Consider it a tribute to the film that each of those postscripts couldnt possibly feel more redundant.

At least thats what I told myself to prepare for watching United 93 a harrowing documentary-style reenactment in real time of what might have happened on the one airplane that didnt fulfill the terrorists intended goals on Sept. 11 2001. We willingly look at terrible things often over and over -- real footage of war and dramatizations actual catastrophes and historical re-creations the tragic outcomes of which are never in doubt -- for the thrill of being alive. Perhaps were as astonished by our own good fortune as we are horrified by the worse fates of others who could just as well have been us. We grieve we resolve we call loved ones we replay the images humbled by our own relief. Movies are the perfect medium for this exercise in gratitude -- they always have been with the screen so big and the audience so huddled together. And the world has never felt more precarious or the distinctions between the lucky and the unlucky more tenuous than they did on the day the World Trade Center fell the Pentagon was attacked and one Boeing 757 crashed near Shanksville Pa. diverted by doomed passengers who died yanking control away from their captors hands. To his great credit British writer-director Paul Greengrass knows this and keeps a cataclysmic story scaled to the vulnerable men and women involved. The result is a movie experience thats undeniably agonizing -- but also unexpectedly bracing in ways I couldnt have prepared for. Pulling the bandage of sentiment cleanly away from oozing concepts like ""heroism"" and ""our nations war on terror"" in the aftermath of recent wounds heres a drama about the most politically charged crisis of our time that grants the dignity of autonomy to every soul involved. In this telling each passenger has a life that began long before he or she boarded the aircraft not a mere representation of citizenry. Each hijacker is a man with a temperament and a religious conviction not a cartoon monster. Todd Beamer (played by David Alan Basche) utters his now-famous ""Lets roll"" as a brief organizational statement to fellow passengers in on the plans to disarm the terrorists not as a booming call to patriotism. No wonder so many guys from aviation were willing to play themselves in the re-creation. Perhaps they too wanted to cheat death by revisiting that day of unfathomable national chaos. It is indeed the awesomeness of puny human size that is newest and most riveting about United 93 -- the way the filmmaker focuses on the ""averageness"" of people who unlike those who watch and remember some five years later must scramble to make sense of incomprehensible events in the moment. (Greengrass first got at this shared smallness in Bloody Sunday his acclaimed 2002 film of the deadly clash between civil rights demonstrators and British troops in Northern Ireland in 1972.) And so in the beginning attention moves casually from the prayerful preparations of the hijackers to the routine of morning activity among flight controllers airplane crew and the everybodies flying from here to there. The movie is tightly built but Greengrass is patient letting events unfold at the pace of reality noticing the splendor of dailiness -- the way FAA honcho Ben Sliney (who plays himself) receives a standard air traffic briefing the way flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw (played by Trish Gates who worked for United herself) changes into heels after takeoff. (Even those professional actors recognizable from their screen and New York stage work -- among them Christian Clemenson Denny Dillon John Rothman and Chip Zien -- manage to vanish into the real people they play.) And when we see that second plane smash into the Twin Towers -- as those in the control tower at Newark did and everyone watching TV did too -- the sight is as dreadful and sickening as if we were seeing it for the first time. But then Greengrass gets back to the still-living hanging in the air. Decisions need to be made at the various flight centers with little confirmed information to go on. At the Northeast Air Defense Sector in upstate New York commanders trained to take action scramble to establish a chain of command that will let them plan a response. On that last doomed plane passengers begin to make those phone calls home that have come to stand as testaments. The final struggle takes only a few minutes but it feels like an eternity a blur of action the deadly outcome of which cannot be changed by wishing it otherwise. Do we need to see this? No. Theres no right or wrong way to remember 9/11 no shame in skipping the movie-fied sight or prize for those who dare to look. Do we benefit from recognizing in United 93 that theres no difference between those who died and us in fear and in courage? Absolutely.
