Let the roaring rampage of revenge begin Except this is really a tale of redemption in which the man formerly known as The Rock must learn to forgive those who done him wrong... while still mutilating them of course. The have-it-both-ways approach quickly grows tiresome and tedious. But at least its not The Tooth Fairy.

Crackerjack driving scene on display here. This amalgamation of many similar type films from yesteryear is finally upended by having a yuppy hitman as one of its 3 main strands. It totally throws the momentum off kilter. The rock is solid in what he is asked to do. Could have been a belter - instead we get a damn good attempt which fails in its own conviction. Look forward to seeing the directors next film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 10 2011MarsellusFeaturedThis is a really unevenly paced film with quite strange touches. The trailer makes it seem like an action film - but it feels much more like an old 60s film like Point Blank with silly modern editing touches thrown in. The Rock is ultimately wasted in a practically non-speaking role and Billy Bob can do so much more than he does here. The character of the Killer really seemed like he should have been written out of the film. Hes not a bad character but the film just wastes far too much time following him around. It wouldnt surprise me if this film goes straight to DVD in the UK. Shame - I was hoping The Rock would have a massive comeback. Perhaps Fast Five will brings the goods.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89397/faster.html,200,faster0,faster,timeout

CBS Films Dwayne Johnson in ""Faster"" (CBS Films) CBS Films Dwayne Johnson in ""Faster"" (CBS Films) Driver (Dwayne Johnson) doesnt say a lot but he doesnt have to. His actions get his point across. And if youre on the list of people he intends to kill whatever conversation ensues will be brief.Fresh out of prison Driver seeks vengeance for the murder of his brother. That includes storming into a telemarketers office and blowing his head off. So what if a security camera records the whole episode -- Driver is a man on a mission.As such he attracts the attention of two cops a burnt-out case with a history of drug addiction (Billy Bob Thornton) and his by-the-book colleague (Carla Gugino). Also monitoring Drivers activities is a hit man (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) who seems more interested in chatting on a cell phone with his therapist than in completing his assignment. Will Driver succeed in getting his revenge? Is this a Hollywood movie?Working from a screenplay by brothers Tony and Joe Gayton director George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food"") delivers solid action in the early going but the film falls victim to second-act meandering. ""Faster"" plays as if Tillman studied the works of director Michael Mann (""Heat"") but got a C on the final exam. A potentially poignant scene in which a reformed criminal begs Driver to spare his life elicited unintentional laughs. Johnson demonstrates a stoic resolve that recalls 70s-era Clint Eastwood. Regardless of his skills as an actor Johnson has a strong screen presence thats ideal for roles like this. Thornton who won an Oscar for writing ""Sling Blade"" as well as receiving acting nominations for that film and ""A Simple Plan"" gets by on his essential Billy Bob-ness.Only Gugino one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood displays emotional complexity -- and do you really need that in an action flick?Actually yes.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 24 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Dwayne Johnson makes a getaway from all the Disney fluff hes been in recently with the R-rated action flick Faster. Thats R as in robbery revenge redemption and V-RRRRR-OOM - speeding spinning stunt cars. Johnson is Driver just out of jail after 10 years for a botched bank robbery. (He was wheel man on the caper.) Now after a decade of stomach churning and barbell hoisting hes ripped and ready to kill a ready list of bad guys who set him up and killed his older brother. Movies Faster The official trailer Movies A Faster premiere for Thornton and Johnson The cars-and-kills marathon has two fancy-Dan touches (three if you count Billy Bob Thorntons unlikely waterfall toupee). The first is a serious Sergio Leone motif - the protagonists all arrive with identifying labels like the characters in The Good The Bad and the Ugly. Only here we have Driver (Johnson) Cop (Billy Bob) and Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Not only that the film comes with lots of sun-bleached terrain and very little dialogue - Leone trademarks. Then theres the revenge theme the blood-red sauce that covered all the Italian filmmakers spaghetti westerns. And if you dont make the connection after all that Faster really hits you on the head with a harmonica using Ennio Morricones theme from The Good The Bad and the Ugly as the ringtone for Killers cellphone. The second out-there flourish is the aforementioned Killer an impeccably dressed twentysomething big-game hunter who is always on the lookout for dangerous trophy victims - targets that can fight back. The Natural Born Preppie it turns out is on Drivers trail as well as the police. And so off we go - The Driver The Cop and the Killer is a three-man multicar shoot-out. Last coughing carburetor wins. Say this the film is continuously absorbing. For the first hour or so you cant keep your eyes or ears off it. The soundtrack is full of unexpected tricks - Iggy and the Stooges I Wanna Be Your Dog following up Kenny Rogerss Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In) then later the old blues song John the Revelator. Plus theres Carla Gugino playing a salty open-blouse detective. Her partner Billy Bob delivers his most interesting performance in years as a detective shaking off heroin addiction. And Johnson last seen in the dire family comedy Tooth Fairy is well cast - credible at last as a sullen silent assassin with a prison-yard weightlifters physique. Faster also has a couple of tense well-played murder scenes that aficionados of the revenge-movie genre will appreciate. Still theres no getting around it Screenwriters Tony and George Gayton along with director George Tillman Jr. ( Men of Honor) should have their licences suspended for letting their genre vehicle fly so recklessly and stupidly out of control. The Killer subplot looks and feels like it was grafted on with Krazy Glue. Thorntons character never adds up. And the films big whiplash surprise ending is a real youve-got-to-be-kidding groaner. Anyone interested in a no-seatbelts out-of-control action flick will find much to enjoy in Faster; although even they may prefer seeing it in Blu-Ray at home which would allow for trips to the fridge for fuel when the film begins to idle in the last reel.

Director Mark Neale Running time 138 Release Opened Nov 24 2010  Editorial Review In Faster its a car not actors that drives movie By Dan Kois Wednesday November 24 2010 To appreciate ""Faster"" a sun-baked revenge flick directed by George Tillman Jr. it helps to have a healthy respect for the movies charismatic star. Gritty weathered and pushing 40 the hero of ""Faster"" may have a few miles on the odometer but that doesnt stop Tillman from filming his star lovingly - letting that muscular powerful body prowl across the frame while a throaty sexy growl issues forth from its engine. Yes its engine. ""Faster"" works best as an ode to the awesome power of the Chevrolet Chevelle SS. (Debate rages on the Internet Movie Car Database over whether its a 70 a 71 or some unholy mash-up of the two.) By the end of this underwritten wanna-B movie only the black-and-white muscle car is left standing with its dignity intact. Okay okay ""Faster"" also has humans in it. (Someone needs to drive the car) That someone is Dwayne Johnson playing a not-unimpressive side of beef who in his first days out of prison is gunning for the backstabbing crooks who killed his brother. Hes identified fittingly only as Driver. As an actor playing a surgeon might spend time observing a hospital so Johnson appears to have modeled his performance on the bulls of Pamplona. We first see him pacing his cell gleaming with sweat and snorting with rage as guards approach to lead him to freedom. Driver leaves jail at a dead run and doesnt stop until he finds the Chevelle inside which an accomplice has placed a gun and directions to his first revengee. In a matter of moments he has driven across town stalked across six lanes of traffic and shot a man in the head without a word. Drivers single-mindedness makes ""Faster"" awfully simple-minded. In his white-hot rage Driver is an unstoppable force and his targets fall before his might (and his gigantic pistol) like wheat before the scythe. Like its protagonist ""Faster"" moves in a straight line ticking off its plot points as Driver ticks villains off his list; even the scripts ostensible twist is telegraphed well ahead of time. Whether you view such a movie as gratifyingly unfussy or gratingly dull-witted depends on your taste. Of course ""Faster"" does place a few obstacles in Drivers way as a citizen of Pamplona might briefly trip a bull while being trampled. Billy Bob Thornton and Carla Gugino play cops trying to predict Drivers next deserving victim. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays one of the fated victims once a drug addict now an evangelist who has turned his life around; his tearful showdown with Driver on a deserted beach is one of ""Fasters"" few truly gripping moments. And in a ludicrous subplot Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays a wealthy British assassin who hired by a potential victim decamps from his luxurious home in a Ferrari to target Driver. In an even more ludicrous sub-subplot Killer - thats his name - has an emotional crisis that leads him to propose to his girlfriend (Maggie Grace). Their wedding in an empty desert chapel seems a nod to the similar scene that kicks off the ultimate in 70s-throwback revenge fantasies Quentin Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" films. And your feelings about ""Kill Bill"" will go a long way in determining whether youll like ""Faster."" Did you wish that ""Kill Bill"" had gone a little well faster? That Tarantino had excised all those narrative filigrees and witty conversations and exotically choreographed fight scenes and had just gotten on with the revenge already? Then ""Faster"" is a movie for you. Or you can try this simple litmus test Are you a car? If so speed do not idle directly to your local drive-in to see the 1970 (or 71) Chevelle SS in ""Faster."" Ignore all those humans on the screen - it wont be tough - and watch as a road warrior gets a well-deserved star turn. Contains strong violence some drug use and language.

If they gave awards for versatility surely one would go to Dwayne Johnson the erstwhile wrestler once known as The Rock. In the space of 10 months he has gone from donning a tutu for the title role in the kid-friendly ""The Tooth Fairy"" to playing a cold-blooded killer in the desultory and silly revenge thriller ""Faster."" Identified as ""Driver"" Johnsons character released from prison after a 10-year stretch sets out to eliminate those who put him there -- and more importantly killed his brother in the wake of a bank robbery. Drivers killing spree quickly attracts the attention of ""Cop"" (Billy Bob Thornton) a detective whos scheduled to retire in 10 days after decades of working the mean streets of Bakersfield Calif. That Cop who has a drug problem and a reluctant partner (Carla Gugino) might have more than a strictly professional interest in the case is apparent after roughly 10 seconds. The third main character is Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) a ""pretty"" (in the films words) Internet billionaire who tries to ward off boredom by taking pro bono hit jobs -- in this case hes been hired to take out Driver by one of his potential victims. Many bullets are expended and much rubber is burned in ""Faster"" one of those movies where the characters have convoluted back stories that are often unintentionally funny. Despite much effort neither Johnson nor director George Tillman Jr. (""Notorious"") can make this preposterous tale the latest misfire from CBS Films live up to its title.

He hits the ground running (literally) the moment he steps out of prison determined to exact revenge for a double cross that resulted in the death of his brother after a bank robbery. The opening credits are barely over when he executes his first victim without so much as a one-liner or raised eyebrow.Hes pursued by the Cop (Billy Bob Thornton) a strung-out addict with a broken marriage who is only weeks away from retirement. Also on his heels is the Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) a young self-made millionaire with model looks and a gorgeous girlfriend (Maggie Grace); Killer works as a hit man out of boredom.If it all sounds a bit thin thats because it is. Therein lies the charm for viewers who dont mind the occasional slice of pulp filmmaking. Its a throwback to the gritty low-budget revenge flicks of the 70s and early 80s a lean and mean revenge thriller in the mold of Walter Hills The Driver or John Boormans Point Blank. It moves swiftly and without pretense never pausing to qualify its brutality but not wallowing in it either.Johnsons performance is one of seething rage camouflaging emotional scars as ugly as the physical ones a grim single-minded figure straight out of a Jim Thompson or Richard Stark novel. Its a simple role with few lines but Johnson fleshes Driver out more than expected. Jackson-Cohen is fine as the Killer but the character feels oddly out of place; its as if his role in the story was either trimmed too much or added as an afterthought and his presence feels superfluous. Thornton lands the meatiest role a character equal parts good bad and ugly who is perhaps the most accessible one in the movie.Director George Tillman Jr.s uneven list of credits includes Soul Food Men of Honor and Notorious. With Faster he still shows some inconsistency but draws compelling performances from his cast. He uses just enough restraint to bring the material to life without relying on style over substance. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Chuck Hodes) Joe Neumaier Wednesday November 24 2010 400 AM Title Faster An ex-con hunts the gang that killed his brother as a cop and a hit man trail him. With Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton. Director George Tillman Jr. (138). R Violence language. At area theaters.Early in ""Faster"" the antihero simply known as ""Driver"" and played equally simply by Dwayne Johnson races about like a just-paroled chicken with his head cut off running down a dusty road rushing to a car lot pulling a vintage Chevelle Malibu coupe out of storage and then proceeding to put a gun to the head of everyone he sees.Some of them are guilty of killing Drivers brother 10 years ago after a bank-heist-gone-bad. Others are just innocent bystanders and thus not killed by Driver whom we only know by that nickname -- just as a cop on his trail is called ""Cop"" and a killer is ""Killer."" Those descriptive names are as imaginative as this blandly done jumpy action flick gets. The nickname itself is a reference to ""The Driver"" a cult pulp film of the 70s.Left for dead by a snitch and his team a decade ago Driver gets out of a California maximum security prison with a steel plate in his head a hole in his cheek and a score to settle. As the bodies pile up a hard-bitten policewoman (Carla Gugino) is on the case with a junkie detective (Billy Bob Thornton) whose interest in Drivers victims is more than procedural. Then theres a sociopathic English hit man (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) under orders to take down Driver.Director George Tillman Jr. (""Notorious"") injects style into the familiar hunter-and-hunted scenario tweaking the movies name by using excessive slow motion and utilizing the wide roads of half-deserted desert towns. Yet after an initial burst of energy things trudge along. Even Drivers skill is overhyped; when driving a getaway car going backward for blocks is inefficient.Thornton however happily moves in low gear letting his Arkansas drawl and insouciant leer fill the gaps in Tony and Joe Gaytons script a stitched-together job filled with lines like ""Im a couple of weeks away from retirement"" and ""Im fast but hes faster.""Jackson-Cohens  looks will likely get him remembered if people can get past his ridiculous tics and wanna-be-assassin bride. Theyre like Tarantino characters without the pop.As for Johnson now established firmly as a family-film star it seems the once and future Rock needed to remind moviegoers he can do gunplay as well as childs play. He succeeds but only because Johnson knows how to be human-sized within a bulked-up behemoth like ""Faster.""

""The Rock"" muscled up for the role but its probably not enough to help out at the box office according to Horgen. Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Dwayne Johnson couldnt make a great action movie if his career depended on it. Luckily the former pro-wrestlers career hasnt depended on it for years. After fleeing Vince McMahons wrestling gulag in the mid-2000s Johnson embarked on a short but rather unsuccessful campaign of forgettable action films (""Walking Tall"" ""Doom""). Then he realized something Hes funny. Behind all those layers of brawn is an actor with great comic timing and the charming ability to make fun of himself. He stole scenes from John Travolta as a gay bodyguard in ""Be Cool."" He out-Steve Carelled Steve Carell in ""Get Smart."" And hes committed himself to Disney on numerous occasions most recently as the only good thing in ""The Tooth Fairy."" Apparently the comedy sabbatical is over. In ""Faster"" Johnson trades in his congenial smile for a cold grimace. And hes bulked up -- to the point that his neck muscles appear to have muscles. All the better for a revenge saga that can be described simply as They killed his brother now hes going to kill them. ""Faster"" suggests an homage to the pulpy exploitation films of the 1970s. Director George Tillman (""Notorious"") makes no reservations about this pursuit. But unlike Robert Rodriguezs ""Machete"" which stirred its bloodbath with bits of humor ""Faster"" is dead serious. Ten years removed from a botched robbery in which his brother was murdered -- and he was shot in the head -- Johnson is out of prison and ready for payback. Tillman introduces his characters simply as action archetypes. Johnson is labeled ""Driver"" as he begins his warpath from behind the wheel of a snarling Chevy Chevelle. A shaggier-than-usual Billy Bob Thornton is ""Cop"" a beleaguered detective in hot pursuit. Then theres a hired assassin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) sent to stop Driver. Hes called ""Killer."" Subtlety was blown out of the frame like brain fragments when ""Faster"" was conceived. The inclusion of the assassin -- a millionaire who kills for sport -- is a strange one. He seems to have been dropped in from another movie with subplots of his own (in between fight scenes he marries his girlfriend). Johnson is as comfortable as ever here. He has a physicality and charisma that lend themselves naturally to ""Fasters"" frantic stylized action. But the revenge material is nothing we havent seen before. Johnsons movies work best when hes playing his funny opposite. Comedy is hard. Badass is not. He doesnt necessarily need to be the Tooth Fairy but playing a juiced-up superhero who ""refused to die"" seems to always result in the same thing for him. Its simply adequate. thorgenstartribune.com 612-673-7909 tomhorgen View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

ABOUT THE MOVIEFaster  (out of four) Stars Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton Carla Gugino Oliver Jackson-Cohen Mike Epps Tom BerengerDirector George Tillman Jr.Distributor CBS FilmsRating R for strong violence some drug use and brief languageRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide Faster accelerates Dwayne Johnsons persona little else By Claudia Puig USA TODAY You wont have to work too hard to keep up with Faster despite its twists turns and a car chase mostly in reverse. Most of it is pretty predictable familiar stuff. But Dwayne Johnson has a presence whose sum is more than the total of his acting parts. Characters in this revenge action drama are known by their roles/archetypes. Johnson is Driver a man we know little about except that he was just released from 10 years in prison and is bent on vengeance for the murder of his brother during the botched bank robbery that led to his imprisonment. TRAILER See if you can keep up with Faster Johnson is always watchable and given his hulking physicality is a natural action hero. Hes so charismatic that despite his bank robbery conviction its hard to keep from rooting for him. Maybe thats due to the snivelly nature of the lead detective on the case known as Cop. As played by Billy Bob Thornton we know hes a liar -- hes a drug user who claims to be clean. His tough-as-nails partner who does get a name though only a last one is Cicero (Carla Gugino). She is either miscast in this role or just dull and one-dimensional. Theres some animosity and sexual tension between the two cops but their chemistry is negligible. And speaking of uninteresting theres also a character known only as Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Hes a walking cliche a handsome guy who overcame a childhood ailment made a killing on an Internet business and is now dashing and rich. He drives a Ferrari and has a beautiful blonde girlfriend. He may be a trained assassin or he may just kill for amusement. Driver is clearly driven. He plans to systematically kill anyone associated with his brothers murder. Part of the problem is that everyone else in the movie falls into the background when the charismatic Johnson is on screen. Its not only because no one elses acting is terribly believable but also because thats the way the revenge drama is written. Were meant only to have eyes for Driver who we sense is more principled than he seems. While there are a few entertaining action scenes and an intriguingly moody look to the mostly drab locations and production design theres also a plodding sense to the movie. It hints at ideas of redemption and letting the past go but winds up having little to say on these topics. Despite his wrestling background and his sculpted physique Johnson is not adept at playing brooding. He spends most of the movie with the same steely-eyed expression. Hes more warmly appealing in gentle comic mode such as in Tooth Fairy and The Game Plan even if those stories are even more formulaic than this one. Maybe its the playing against type that works best for Johnson. Here he falls into tight-lipped hero mode and doesnt let his natural ease with humor come through. The perfect vehicle for Johnsons charm and talents is still out there. Its certainly not in the muscle car he pilots in Faster.

"Faster review Gracefully directed this action film thats just plain fun |       NJ.com comments Faster review Gracefully directed this action film thats just plain fun Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 24 2010 at 806 AM View/Post Comments CBS FILMSDwayne Johnson is ""the driver"" in ""Faster"" directed by George Tillman Jr. Dwayne Johnson is a just-released con with a metal plate in his head and a list of people he needs to kill. Billy Bob Thornton is a cop with ""10 days to retirement"" -- uh-oh -- and a determination to catch up with this killer. And Oliver Jackson-Cohen is a multimillionaire software designer turned mysterious assassin whos out to get to Johnson first. They are the main characters of the new action movie ""Faster."" They are also -- lets face it -- a total cheese sandwich. I mean really. A multimillionaire software designer turned hired assassin? And did I mention that the film refers to them with existential emphasis only as ""Driver"" ""Cop"" and ""Killer""? Movie Review Faster (R) CBS Films (98 min.)Directed by George Tillman Jr. With Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains The film contains gory violence strong language drug use and sexual situations. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS This is the sort of stuff commonly dismissed as ""comic book"" (even though quite a few comics are far smarter) -- the sort of high-concept aint-it-cool ideas that spring from nominally bright 12-year-olds. Yet sometimes all you really want is a cheese sandwich. Sometimes its fun to be 12 for a while. And as big dumb action movies go ""Faster"" is big dumb fun for a while -- a nicely photographed quickly edited and calmly underplayed flick that taking the advice of its title does what it needs to do quickly. The script is really pretty silly -- or so at least are the parts having to do with ""Killer"" which have him either talking to his shrink snuggling with his girlfriend or thinking about his lousy childhood. Aww. But Johnson is a stoic presence -- really his lines couldnt have taken up more than a few index cards -- while his passionless stalking of his prey (they killed his brother you see) wouldnt have been out of place in ""Point Blank."" And Thornton -- despite a wig that looks like a carpet remnant -- takes some care with his police officer. The man has a truly haunted look (with good reason as well eventually find out) and his few scenes with his schlubby son have a gentle grace. Credit director George Tillman Jr. for much of this. His last movie ""Notorious"" suffered from its ""authorized"" stance but the earlier ""Soul Food"" and ""Men of Honor"" had a straightforward charm. He gets a little fancier here adding slow-motion altered film stocks and all the other tricks of the modern action movie. But given the material thats to be expected. And even amidst all the shooting he takes time to underline a few small ideas -- the struggles of fathers and sons the difficulty of forgiveness the possibility of redemption. Of course in the end this is what it still is -- about an hour and a half of Johnson driving around in a muscle car funky music pounding on the soundtrack while he blows people away. But you cant underestimate the occasional entertainment of a thing like that. And neither thankfully does the director of ""Faster."" Stephen Whitty.

Faster Fair Director George Tillman Jr. Cast Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Rating R for strong violence drug use and language. Spotlight Dwayne Johnson Revenge movies Dwayne Johnson moves away - far away - from the kid-friendly roles hes made his meal ticket the last few years. Just how far? The first time he shoots someone in the forehead offers a good indication just as ""first"" implies more to come. Director George Tillman Jr. doesnt bestow the main characters with names as such; instead theyre types. Johnson is Driver in prison after a set-up following a bank robbery left his brother dead (yes Driver was the driver. Subtlety isnt part of Tillmans game plan). Upon his release Driver literally runs out of prison and begins eliminating everyone involved in his brothers death. He makes no attempt to hide what hes doing; lucky for him law-enforcement is a little slow on the uptake. ""Cop"" (Billy Bob Thornton) lands the case working with Cicero (Carla Gugino) who actually gets a name. Shes not thrilled about the pairing Cop is a junkie (cliche alert) close to retirement. Hes also trying to patch things up with his ex-wife (Moon Bloodgood) and Tommy their son (Aedin Mincks); the few moments he spends with Tommy are a highlight of the film. So far so dumb which in this context also means so good. But Tillman and writers Tony and Joe Gayton introduce another character Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) a fit neat rich fellow who made a fortune with an Internet company and now takes assassin-for-hire jobs for the fun of it. Hes concerned about becoming distracted by his girlfriend Lily (Maggie Grace) when he gets a mystery call offering another job another target Driver. Killer is interesting enough but seems out of place in the gritty cat-and-mouse game played by Cop and Driver. Its no fault of Jackson-Cohen who brings humor to the role. He just doesnt quite fit. Thornton somehow makes an underwritten role (all of them are) more interesting than it should be. Most of that is due to simply watching Thornton who excels at the twitchy slightly unhinged type of role he has here. But theres more to it as well Thornton makes Cop seem genuine in wanting to right old wrongs. Which to Drivers way of thinking is what he is up to as well. But the role is so one-note that its difficult to call what the likable Johnson does here acting. He starts the film amped up and never really backs off from that; when he spots his next victim he simply goes from angry to furious. Its kind of fun to watch but challenging its not. A few tears shed later in the film dont really add much to our perception of the character. Thats actually OK. ""Faster"" is a stripped-down affair from title to characters to plot. It never strives to be more instead concentrating on making the most of its self-imposed limitations. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

A straight-faced homage to the kind of 70s guy-with-a-gun movies that Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have canonized Faster grafts that genres style onto a deadbeat script and leaves it to Johnson -- as deadly focused as a gunsight -- to make it all believable. The problem is he cant The artist formerly known as The Rock has spent so many years undercutting his own tough-guy image (see Tooth Fairy The Game Plan) you half expect him to wink every time he pulls the trigger.

Starring Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton Oliver Cohen and Carla Gugino. Directed by George Tillman Jr. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Rock didnt start calling himself by his actual name Dwayne Johnson so he could make garbage like ""Faster."" This film is a comedown and indicates something is going very wrong in either Johnsons opportunities or his choices. In either case hed be better off cutting his overhead taking a one-bedroom apartment somewhere and waiting for a director to take him seriously before allowing himself ever again to get treated like an ambulatory hunk of meat as he is in this movie. The thing is within his sphere Johnson can act. He has a fair degree of charm and he even has - when called upon to demonstrate it - a healthy sense of the ridiculous. But watching him in ""Faster"" you could easily think Stone Cold Steve Austin is Olivier in comparison because Johnson gets to do nothing but smolder drive backward and shoot unarmed people in the head. Heres an interesting truth about action movies one thats surprising and yet borne out in practice Revenge is a lousy motivator for action. Theres no urgency about revenge. In the aftermath of some colossal wrong an avenger might strike today or tomorrow or next week or next year. In fact he could choose never to strike and nothing would change. The desire for revenge exists almost entirely within the character and barely within the audience. Of course the limitations of the revenge plot become exponentially worse in a gauche tasteless clueless exercise like ""Faster"" which treats us to the sight of our hero blowing away defenseless people as though that were a good thing. Or admirable. Or funny. Or cool. Actually its hard to say what effect director George Tillman Jr. is pursuing beyond simply operating on the faith that if its an action movie the more dead people the better. Under these circumstances no matter how guilty our knucklehead-protagonists victims supposedly are its difficult to maintain a rooting interest. Screenwriters Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton try to energize the revenge formula by having our hero being chased as hes doing the chasing. Johnson plays an ex-con out to revenge his brothers death. Meanwhile a drug-addicted cop (Billy Bob Thornton) is on his tail and so is a thoroughly repellent hobbyist hit man (Oliver Cohen). The problem with this setup however is in the character motivations. Neither man-hunter is given any galvanizing cause to stop our hero. They barely care and the audience cares less than they do. Nothing is personal. Its all mechanics for them and for the filmmakers. This isnt complicated All we need from an action movie is an intense reason to care and a big payoff. We may want more from an action movie but thats what we absolutely must have. We get neither in ""Faster."" A sure indication of the movies complete failure is that when its over it doesnt feel over. Instead of a resolution its just another dead body. We know that its the climax only because the soundtrack insists on it. -- Advisory This film contains violence and drug use.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Faster is meat-and-potatoes action with a side of crazy. On one hand its Dwayne Johnsons butt-kicking apology for ""Tooth Fairy ""The Game Plan and other examples of family-friendly soft Rock. On the other hand its a surprisingly compelling throwback to the drive-in fare of the 1970s when macho existentialists drove muscle cars across the California desert just for the pleasure of killing each other.The Rock plays ""The Driver released from a 10-year prison stretch when the film opens and embarking on a methodical quest to avenge himself against the gang that murdered his bank-robbing brother (Matt Gerald).The early-Arnold comparisons are unavoidable Director George Tillman Jr. (""Notorious) constantly films Johnson from below in an effort to make him look like an unstoppable death machine. What he looks like actually is an armed Easter Island statue.Two other characters figure into the drama Billy Bob Thornton as a cop -- excuse me ""The Cop -- who when he isnt shooting up heroin in toilets is investigating The Drivers long trail of bodies and ""The Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) a professional assassin hired to bring The Driver down.The latter is both the movies most original creation and its silliest -- a handsome yuppie software billionaire so bored with post-buyout life that he takes hit-man jobs for a dollar a pop. When he isnt neurotically stalking his quarry The Killer is fretting about emotional issues and proposing to his girlfriend (Maggie Grace of ""Lost) via Bluetooth.His ringtone is the theme from ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly. You could call this movie ""The Good the Bad and the Metrosexual.""Faster lives up to its title with an over-edited abundance of cars screeching backward forward and sideways and when people in this movie die they die brutally. But the script by Tony and Joe Gayton is just as interested in the ways guilt and vengeance can warp a soul and it pulls a sharp performance from Thornton as a dirty little man trying to wash himself clean.Youll see the big twist coming from far off but ""Faster offers compensatory B-flick stylishness on the way as The Drivers targets shift gradually from creeps to flawed dads to a testifying man of God (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and our giant slab of an antihero develops a warm and fuzzy side. How can you tell? His eyes water a little. Johnson is not a dumb man and he knows a huggable Rock means only one thing. Dermabrasion.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Though Dwayne Johnsons onscreen career has had its ups and down he deserves a hat-tip for only occasionally taking the most obvious career path available to a man whose body looks like it has the stopping power of a highway median divider. But theres something to be said for taking the easy path once in a while. Faster a new thriller directed by George Tillman Jr. (Notorious Soul Food) opens with the man formerly known as The Rock getting released from a 10-year prison sentence. Once out he runs to a nearby junkyard hops in a classic muscle car grabs a gun glances at a list of names and sets about exacting revenge. Its possible Johnsons character studied the John Boorman/Lee Marvin classic Point Blank while in the pokey. Surely Tillman and co-writers Tony and Joe Gayton did. As he works his way through the list Johnson moves with an intense focus and brutal single-mindedness that would do Marvin proud and though Faster has little of the craft or existential subtext of its inspiration one characters admiring assessment of Johnsons killing technique applies for the most part to the film around him ""Completely artless... but pure."" Its also a little nutty. Two men stand in Johnsons way. One simply labeled ""Cop"" (Boxmasters frontman Billy Bob Thornton) is a soon-to-retire Bakersfield detective with a heroin habit and a corduroy-heavy wardrobe. The other introduced as ""Killer"" (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is a gleam-toothed hit man who sees murder-for-hire as an extension of his lifelong quest for self-improvement. (In an early scene he tells girlfriend Maggie Grace hes ""beaten"" yoga.) Thus a trio of damaged men with guns go about trying to kill or capture one another across a long bloody stretch of desert between Bakersfield California and Henderson Nevada. Its as fun as it sounds but only up to a point. After a while Tillman forgets the title of his own film and hits a bad patch of third-act muck where Faster starts to lay on a heavy-handed message about the importance of forgiveness. That isnt what anyone showed up to see. Johnson muscle cars and grim expressions on the other hand go great together. It isnt the most artful combination of elements but the purity is admirable.

"Faster | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; faster ) Faster (United States 2010) November 23 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With a title like Faster it has to be a balls-to-the-walls action flick right? Although thats how George Tillman Jr.s feature is being marketed thats not what it is. Faster is a revenge thriller thats more interested in delving into the dark parts of the human soul than it is in delivering carefully modulated doses of adrenaline and testosterone. Its a moody melancholy affair about one mans determination to avenge the murder of his brother - at all costs. The movie is not entirely devoid of action but the perfunctory scenes of that nature which include a couple of car chases a knife fight and a few shoot-outs arent likely to significantly elevate the pulse rate. As films of this genre go Faster is a middle-of-the-road offering but those expecting something fast-paced and frenetic are likely to be disappointed. Faster focuses on three characters whose lives converge. None of them have names - they are identified only by their occupations. ""Driver"" (Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock) has just been released from prison after serving ten years for a bank robbery. Over that time he has nursed a desire for revenge until it has become his sole reason for living. He is intent upon killing everyone responsible for his brothers death and he has amassed the resources to achieve that aim. ""Cop"" (Billy Bob Thornton) is the heroin addicted police officer who has been partnered with the no-nonsense Detective Cicero (Carla Gugino) to track down Driver after the body count begins to multiply. And ""Killer"" (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is the hit man hired by an unknown client to take out Driver before he completes his task. Killer is good at what he does but hes beginning to have second thoughts about his line of work and he has promised his new wife Lily (Maggie Grace) that this will be his last job. Surviving an encounter with Driver however might be the greatest challenge Killer has faced. The screenplay by Tony and Joe Gayton takes great pains to develop the three main characters into more than traditional action film types. In that aim it is moderately but not entirely successful. We are provided with insight into Drivers childhood and motivations. Cop is shown to have a compromised marriage but he obviously loves his son. A childhood infirmity is a driving force in Killers overachieving personality. Although I appreciate Fasters attempts to build its central figures into somewhat three-dimensional individuals a lot of what were presented with seems like window dressing and rather than fleshing out the protagonists it slows down the pace. The irony is obvious because of its commitment to lukewarm drama and lengthy exposition there are times when Faster drags. Once not that many years ago The Rock was being touted as Arnold Schwarzeneggers action hero successor - a mantle that was jokingly conferred in The Rundown. However while The Rock has never achieved the level of stardom attained by Schwarzenegger he has become a bankable commodity for both action films and fish-out-of-water comedies. In Faster he appears to have modeled Driver after Schwarzeneggers most famous role The Terminator. For much of the film Driver is a cold emotionless killer taking out his targets without compunction or consideration of the consequences. His backstory told mainly through flashbacks humanizes the man he was not the man he has become. He has little dialogue. Its an effective performance because it demands intensity but not range - something at which The Rock excels. His co-stars perform in his shadow but are capable. Billy Bob Thornton adds a dash of humanity to the sleaze enveloping Cop and Oliver Jackson-Cohen shows aspects of fear and uncertainty beneath a mask of handsome bravado. Fasters ending is problematic and provokes a hollow feeling although perhaps thats the intention. One of the movies themes hammered home by the sermons of a radio evangelist heard on the soundtrack as Driver speeds along lonely roads is that redemption comes through forgiveness and that only through redemption can a mans soul emerge from darkness. Still the final confrontation is anticlimactic and theres a sense that things have ended on a wrong note with too much unresolved. The movie as a whole is downbeat so theres no reason for the ending to have adopted a different posture. This is an atypical revenge thriller steeped as it is in darkness and misery. With the protagonist being so mechanical in his attitude its easier but less rewarding to sympathize with the other characters and that results in a seeming imbalance in Fasters structure. The lack of an unambiguous catharsis so ingrained in the fabric of the genre gives a dour cast to the ending. Faster is grim but holds the attention; it does not however offer the kind of mindless action excursion that many will be anticipating.

(CHUCK HODES PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraTues. Nov. 23 2010Faster (out of 4)Starring Dwayne Johnson Billy Bob Thornton Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Directed by George Tillman Jr.Faster than you can say ""youve paid your debt to society"" a man named Driver is literally jogging away from a long stretch in the Big House to a nearby junkyard where a souped-up car awaits and immediately embarks on a high-speed race to avenge the death of his brother following a bank robbery 10 years earlier.When he arrives at the office of a private investigator who has compiled the names of his targets and produces a wad of money to pay for his services the man asks how he managed to smuggle that much dough out of prison.Article Continued Below""You dont want to know"" Driver (played by former footballer and wrestler Dwayne Johnson) deadpans. Ouch. Say no more.As revenge flicks go Faster pretty much follows the same path. The script by Joe and Tony Gayton does try to inject something fresh into the well-worn formula by putting both a contract killer and a junkie cop (played by Billy Bob Thornton) on his trail.The hits on the first two targets go pretty much according to plan. The first guy is a telemarketer the other a sex offender who comes within a whisker of ravishing an unsuspecting young woman. Under the moral code that rules in this type of morality tale these are two dirt-bags who dearly deserve whats coming to them. After that things go somewhat awry.Director George Tillman Jr. creates a sombre moody landscape in which the action unfolds using dark rhythmic music and some interestingly quirky camera angles. But in the end it is what it is.Johnson a massive tattooed side of beef with a couple of ugly faux scars does have a certain amount of screen presence. But the role necessarily limits his facial expressions to grim determination and occasional teary-eyed intensity.""Youve got issues"" one characters comments to our protagonist a rare moment of understatement and levity.Thornton does a nice turn as the cop a twitchy badly dressed wreck of a man. The killer (played by handsome British actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is less persuasive with idiosyncrasies of his own that require phone sessions with a therapist and unspecified medication. All three driven by different obsessions have one thing in common They could all desperately use a good shave.There are a couple of plot twists that -- carefully seeded into the story -- are intended to shock and surprise but actually come across as contrived and highly implausible.As for our dark hero his fate is left up in the air with a conclusion that one might have wished would have come um faster.

"The Rock leaves his tutu in the trunk - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Rock leaves his tutu in the trunkFaster a 2 starsNovember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAfter all the baby-sitting hes been doing in movies like ""Tooth Fairy"" and "" Race to Witch Mountain"" its a twisted relief to see Dwayne Johnson shoot a telemarketer in the forehead early on in the new revenge picture ""Faster."" This is an overpacked suitcase disguised as a movie which is appropriate since Johnson is a bulging array of musculature disguised as an ordinary human. Hes good screen company though make no mistake. The film a CBS Films effort offers a few stray diversions even if it plays like three TV crime- drama pilots mistakenly scheduled in the same time slot. The ex-con played by Johnson did 10 years for his role in a bank robbery that turned very bloody. His role was that of getaway driver. He is labeled onscreen only as DRIVER. A blase assassin ( Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is identified onscreen as KILLER. Billy Bob Thornton skeezed-up (in high-def digital skeeze yet) plays a Bakersfield Calif. police detective with a heroin problem. Hes known only as COP. Carla Gugino his partner for some reason has a real name though consistency would dictate she be labeled BETTER-LOOKING COP. The script by Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton isnt really a vehicle for Johnson; its more of a three-headed narrative that keeps knocking heads. Once DRIVER gets out of prison he begins running down his little death list of people -- terrible icky people -- who would deserve to die even if they hadnt killed his beloved half-brother. The wrinkle in ""Faster"" is that it presents a host of domestic and parental challenges for most of the characters. Apartment hallway shootouts imperil preteens who just happen to be in the wrong place; the COP finds his investigation of the serial-killing DRIVER conflicting with his commitments met with only partial success to his Little League-playing son. Director George Tillman Jr. manages to get a decent time-waster out of ""Faster"" (dull title no?). But the most vivid and expressive supporting player is not human which is tricky if youre trying to make a movie in which humans play a part. The scene-stealer happens to be a black Chevy Chevelle which DRIVER drives like a pro. The movie exists for its squealing-tire spins and high-speed-in-reverse moves. The car has more moves than the movie. But just as ""Unstoppable"" reminds us of the simple satisfactions delivered by a slab of rolling metal out of control the comparatively bland ""Faster"" at least reinforces how much joyful noise the right car can make when driven by the right DRIVER and amped-up by a sound designer in love with that Chevelle. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (strong violence some drug use and brief language) Cast Dwayne Johnson (Driver); Billy Bob Thornton (Cop); Oliver Jackson-Cohen (Killer); Carla Gugino (Cicero); Maggie Grace (Lily); Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Evangelist); Tom Berenger (Warden) Credits Directed by George Tillman Jr.; written by Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton; produced by Martin Shafer Liz Glotzer Tony Gayton and Robert Teitel.

It doesnt get much more basic than 1+1+1=3 and thats the formula in ""Faster"" in which three guys named Driver Cop and Killer alternately and sometimes simultaneously play pursued and pursuer. Hinging on the elemental premise of a newly released ex-con hunting down those responsible for murdering his brother this misfired actioner marks Dwayne Johnsons return to muscle movies this time without any measurable humor. His fanbase will nevertheless support this ideal award-season counterprogrammer boosting CBS fledgling film division in the process. Still if hardcore action fans step back a moment they will notice a pronounced shortage of the mind-blowing action sequences they have come to expect from such material especially given the souped-up cars (like the ultra-cool black early 70s Super Sport Chevelle helmed by Johnsons Driver) here on practically erotic display. But director George Tillman Jr. and screenwriters Tony and Joe Gayton tool their breathlessly edited vehicle for five-gear speed shoehorning exposition into adrenaline-pumping scenes to ensure a minimum of pauses or chances to question whats really going on. Upon his release from prison Johnsons Driver literally runs away from the facility and straight into a junkyard where he drives off in the Chevelle. Armed with a list of targets and the grim visage of an ancient warrior he first assassinates a nerdy guy in a Bakersfield telemarketing firm all of it caught on a surveillance camera. Bakersfield police have a face but lead cop Cicero (Carla Gugino) wonders about motive and also about why the declining heroin-addicted Cop (Billy Bob Thornton) has been assigned to the case when hes just two weeks from retirement. The interplay here is instantly tired and Thornton and Gugino are hard-pressed to spice up the routine. ""Faster"" is a movie distracted by itself and struggles to find any particular tone or groove outside Drivers man-on-a-mission single-mindedness. As if to underline this problem the film sets up the third part of its formula by introducing Killer (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) whose hits-for-hire apparently fund his sleek designer lifestyle which includes a hot g.f. (Maggie Grace wasted). Having turned his formerly crippled body into a marvel capable of superhuman yoga moves Killer is now hired to take out Driver. The script inserts some elaborate flashbacks that explain the injustice done to Driver and his brother (a near-cameo from Tom Berenger suggests the Driver is a victim of circumstances). Whats blithely ignored is the fact that its impossible for a big guy to drive like Steve McQueen across half of California killing guys right and left and not be the object of a massive dragnet let alone go unnoticed when he marches into a supposedly secure hospital to kill a patient at point-blank range. Johnson isnt allowed to display his usually ingratiating charm playing a pure vengeance machine with no outlets. Thorntons Cop is at least given some unexpected even startling character twists though Killer is so absurdly conceived that not even Jackson-Cohens Jude Law-like smoothness can save the role. Production elements are hyper-polished with Michael Gradys widescreen lensing switching between reddish earth-toned desert settings and wildly theatrical lighting schemes; David Lazans production design similarly swerves between realist and over-the-top. Clint Mansells score is characteristically intense and jangly. FasterProductionA CBS Films release presented with TriStar Pictures of a Castle Rock Entertainment/State Street Pictures production.

Daily Edition Login to download Faster Film Review 1157 AM PST 11/23/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A throwback to the 70s -- straight action with a few clever twists all anchored by solid characters actors TWITTER ""Faster"" is stripped for action without a moment wasted on unnecessary dialogue exposition or nuances. It starts the moment Dwayne Johnsonas archetypical character Driver sprints out of prison after 10 years in stir and doesnat stop until a bullet penetrates the brainpan of the last bad guy. Directed by George Tillman Jr. Faster possesses the white-heat fervor of a70s exploitation movies with a refreshing emphasis on actual stunts involving cars weapons and actors who buffed up in the gym for months. No sissy CGI stuff here. (Okay itas minimal.) This is a guys movie where the female characters are as tough as the men. One woman celebrates her wedding with target practice out in the desert. She hits everything she aims at and doesnt even bother to take off the wedding dress. So while some family members may frolic Thanksgiving weekend with young wizards a fairy-tale princess a rom-com or a musical guys will watch football -- or take in Faster. This counter-programming might actually work. Johnson formerly The Rock says goodbye to his Disney period to return to the kind of raw action that made his name. He plays a man so single-minded that a simple hello would be a distraction. When Driver races out of prison he means to gun down one by one the men who killed his brother 10 years ago. That he and his brother had robbed a bank and were relaxing with their loot in what they believed was a safe house along with the rest of the gang is beside the point. In the moral universe of Faster everyone is wretched and corrupt. Just some are more so. Driver has something of a conscience. He refuses to pull a trigger when an innocent person gets between him and his target. Anyone not on his to-do list also fails to interest him. Only as time wears on -- the film spans five days -- he becomes aware that the list is incomplete. Roaming the California desert from Bakersfield into Nevada and back he attracts a following. A police detective the Cop (Billy Bob Thornton) only days from retirement draws the assignment after the first murder to the disgust of his partner (Carla Gugino). Little wonder Cop is a junkie. Then someone hires a professional assassin the Killer (newcomer Oliver Jackson-Cohen) a Brit who sees hunting humans as a new kind of extreme sport where he might test himself physically and mentally. Each suspense or action sequence in Joe and Tony Gaytons screenplay manages to fill a viewer in on motivations and back stories. These are all done with an economy of purpose. Childhood abuse bad cops drug addiction wrong choices wrong crowds underachievement and in one case overachievement -- all these issues feed into the action on screen. You wouldnt want to accuse Faster of having a sense of humor but it has enough a sly wit for a killer to be stalking another killer while talking to his therapist on a hands-free mobile. Then the therapist suddenly to ask ""Are you off your meds?"" The movie itself may be off its meds but for all its mash-up of pulp-fiction types and situations it never completely forsakes logic. A killing or confrontation may be outrageous but never implausible. Stunts with cars may be wild but never violate the laws of physics. Tillman and his writers demonstrate that action can reveal character. These are rudimentary characters to be sure but people who are completely understandable without long dialogue passages. There is one exception in Drivers confrontation with a reformed villain (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Johnson has never had much range as an actor but here he deliberately narrows it even more. He keeps his responses short and his face nearly blank. He uses his tremendous bulk to intimidate and his eyes to hurl warnings. Theres only one scene where his character is asked to demonstrate sentiment and he looks like he cant wait for it to be over. Thornton does suggest a tragic dimension to his junkie Cop. His back story is thinly sketched but his ruination may have come from a love for a woman (Moon Bloodgood) having as much trouble staying clean as he does. Like the Cop Jackson-Cohens Killer could star in his own movie. From the bits fed to audiences by wall photos he seemingly fought off childhood disease with rigid rehab and a triumph over the body that continues in his new twisted profession. The female characters dont receive much attention but Gugino as the other cop and Maggie Grace as Killers gun-totting bride very ably carry off these roles. Clint Mansells propulsive music and some hard-rock songs egg on the action while Michael Gradys camera is fluid and agile without calling attention to itself.
