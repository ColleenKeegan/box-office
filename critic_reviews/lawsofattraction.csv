"Laws of Attraction Attorneys at Love washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Laws of Attraction Attorneys at Love Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 30 2004 Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan create just enough chemistry to carry ""Laws of Attraction"" a tame fitfully amusing and generally inoffensive romantic comedy. As divorce attorneys whose courtroom sparring lays the groundwork for an unlikely but inescapable romance Moore and Brosnan follow in the footsteps of Hepburn and Tracy circa ""Adams Rib."" ""Laws of Attraction"" doesnt possess the verbal dexterity or sparkling wit of that antecedent but it has a modest screwball charm. And its helped considerably by two attractive likable lead players whose unforced appeal can make even the most contrived episodes easy to swallow. Moore plays Audrey Woods an almost-middle-aged careerist who has succeeded in submerging her insecurities under a snaky competitive streak to make partner in her firm and become New Yorks most successful divorce lawyer. Although Audrey lives in a palatial Upper Somewhere apartment and affects a smooth unruffled demeanor the audience is tipped off to her neuroses early on when she compulsively stuffs herself with a Hostess Sno-Ball in a bathroom stall to tamp down pre-hearing nerves. As Daniel Rafferty Brosnan is supposed to represent Audreys raffish counterpoint When she first meets him hes taking a catnap in the courtroom. Just as Audreys character quirks are used to telegraph her repression Daniels peccadilloes are meant to show how earthy he is. His unkempt office is in Chinatown above a deli he frequents Cuban nightclubs and his tie is nearly always askew. Of course this might be an act to throw Audrey off her game. ""Laws of Attraction"" is propelled by Audreys conflicted desire either to trust him and fall in love or to outsmart him and win. Director Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors"") working from a script by Alice Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling manages to imbue this predictable formula with if not ingenuity at least a sprightly efficiency having Audrey and Daniel spar via TV sound bites and adroitly transporting them from Manhattan to a romantic castle in Ireland where they wind up getting married during a drunken night out. Its actually their second drunken night out in a movie that unapologetically celebrates the joys of occasional inebriation -- and cheers to that. Theres not much else to say about ""Laws of Attraction"" without spoiling things further. Brosnan once again demonstrates that he consistently improves the material hes asked to work with; Moore has been served better by the more serious vehicles on her rA(c)sumA(c) but she acquits herself just as respectably in pure fluff. Perhaps the players most deserving of praise in ""Laws of Attraction"" are the supporting actors all of whom supply piquant notes in a production so by-the-numbers that it even features the de rigueur Norah Jones-backed montage. Frances Fisher whos only eight years older than Moore handles the indignity of playing her mother with good humor and grace. Parker Posey does that sublime thing that she does -- and what exactly is that ineffable gift? -- as one of Audreys clients. And the British actor Michael Sheen steals every scene hes in as a pompous mascaraed rock star. While Moore and Brosnan simmer along in their classy genial way Sheens moments deliver quick spikes of comic heat. Laws of Attraction (87 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and language.

Unfortunately shes currently headlining a screwball romantic comedy the limp ""Laws of Attraction"" and ... well better to just remember her brilliance in ""The Hours"" ""Far from Heaven"" or ""Safe"" and give her a pass here. Maybe after carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders in all those dramas she just wanted to smile prettily and kiss Pierce Brosnan and far be it from me to judge her for that. Directed by Peter Howitt (who showed a lighter touch in his debut film ""Sliding Doors"") ""Laws of Attraction"" is clearly made in imitation of the romantic comedies of a bygone era. Its dueling-lawyers-in-love plot is reminiscent of the Hepburn/Tracy classic ""Adams Rib"" with a plot twist that was undeniably fresher back in 1935 when it was employed in the Astaire/Rogers vehicle ""Top Hat."" Daniel (Brosnan) is scruffy undisciplined and adorable; Audrey (Moore) is uptight intense and adorable. They meet cute in the courtroom she decides hes an oaf and you can pretty much write the script yourself from there. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Laws of Attraction"" with Pierce Brosnan Julianne Moore Parker Posey Michael Sheen Frances Fisher Nora Dunn. Directed by Peter Howitt from a screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling. 87 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content and language. Several theaters. Brosnan combining his James Bond lady-killing charm with rumpled suits and mussable hair is terrific at this sort of thing. At one point Daniel plucks a food scrap off Audreys face -- shes got a secret junk-food habit -- and eats it and damned if Brosnan doesnt make it sing turning a cringe-worthy moment into a comic bit. Unfortunately his breeziness calls attention to Moores effortful performance -- you can see her thinking through everything trying desperately to make sense out of a character wed never believe in real life. (Meryl Streep approaches comedy this way too but it works better -- you can at least see that shes amused by the process.) ""Laws of Attraction"" sags where it should float going through the motions of putting Daniel and Audrey together apart and together again. Its not awful but it feels tired like its just another in a long line of cookie-cutter movies about pretty people. Comedy is hard work but the work shouldnt show -- and it shouldnt be an effort to sit through.

(AP Photo/Barry Wetcher) Photo BERNARD WALSH Witty dialogue weds clever direction in courtroom romantic comedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Laws of Attraction Romantic comedy. Starring Pierce Brosnan Julianne Moore Parker Posey Michael Sheen and Frances Fisher. Directed by Peter Howitt. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) After a slew of movies based on Cinderella its a pleasure to come across one inspired by a more sophisticated source ""Adams Rib."" Like the classic 1949 screwball comedy ""Laws of Attraction"" is about opposing divorce lawyers who kiss and make up outside the courtroom though it lacks the wit and inspired casting of the original. While Pierce Brosnan walks around looking uncharacteristically rumpled hes no Spencer Tracy and Julianne Moore possesses neither Katharine Hepburns high spirits nor her cheekbones. Still Brosnan and Moore display a knack for fast delivery of smart dialogue both in court and in bed. Their verbal sparring is the main attraction of ""Laws of Attraction"" and helped me overlook plot holes of massive proportions. Repartee used to be a staple of romantic comedies -- Myrna Loy and William Powell were masters at it Bogey and Bacall made it sexy and Hepburn and Tracy were in a league of their own. But the art of repartee has all but been lost in modern screenplays whose word count often is dangerously anemic. I loved watching Brosnan and Moore go at it as New York lawyers Daniel Rafferty and Audrey Woods. Their first scene together sets the tone. After bragging to her client that shes the best in her field Audrey pumps herself up in the ladies room by stuffing a Sno Ball in her mouth. When she meets her worthy opponent Daniel tries to unnerve her by pointing out a food particle on the side of her mouth. When she unsuccessfully attempts to remove it he does so for her tasting the morsel and correctly identifying the food product. We immediately intuit that this quasi-intimate act will lead to greater intimacy. But the speed with which it occurs -- only slightly longer than a New York minute -- is unexpected if welcome at a time when lust is more prevalent on cable TV than in movies. Director Peter Howitt showed a keen understanding of the odd reasons people fall in love in ""Sliding Doors"" and is on a roll again in the first half of ""Laws of Attraction."" But his film gets into trouble when it leaves U. S. soil for Ireland where Audrey and Daniel travel to check out a castle. Its ownership is disputed by their famous clients -- a clothes designer played with annoying shrillness by Parker Posey and her soon-to-be ex a rock musician (Michael Sheen) apparently modeled after Mick Jagger in terms of the number of groupies hes shagged. During a festival put on by Irish locals Audrey and Daniel get hitched while in a drunken stupor. The morning after they panic realizing what the New York tabloids will make of their abrupt marriage. Whats odd is that these supposedly expert legal minds never suspect their wedding might be bogus because they hadnt signed any legal documents or undergone blood tests. Indeed the ""wedding"" was performed by a servant at the castle (a far-too- small role for the divine David Kelly of ""Waking Ned Devine""). Frances Fisher is amusing as Audreys society mother whose strivings to achieve eternal youth lead her to insist that her daughter never call her ""mom"" when theyre out in public. Its an odd bit of casting considering Fisher is only nine years older than Moore but the actresses make the mother- daughter relationship credible. Brosnan keeps trying to shed his .007 persona to achieve an after-career like Sean Connerys. ""Attraction"" screenwriters Aline Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling help out by making Daniel a true eccentric who keeps a disheveled office in Chinatown although he clearly can afford a more fashionable Manhattan address. The movies attention to detail is commendable. Moore shows up to speak at a legal panel in the same print scarf she wore in the scene before. Just as you start to wonder why the reason is explained A hidden camera has captured her ruffling through Daniels desk when he was out of the office. As he displays photos of her to the audience ostensibly to show the range of a small camera Audrey rips off her scarf another funny moment in a movie good for a few laughs.

LAWS OF ATTRACTION Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/laws-of-attraction-2004,200,lawsofattraction8,lawsofattraction,rogerebert
"Laws breaks the rules of attraction - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Laws breaks the rules of attraction By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 30 2004 ""Laws of Attraction"" is like the Hepburn-Tracy movie ""Adams Rib"" -- without Hepburn Tracy Adam or his rib.Theres not much of a script. The direction is the pits and stars Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore playing dueling divorce lawyers who fall in love are lousy too. Nevertheless I saw more than one woman turn to her friend on the way out of the theater and say ""It was cute."" In other words if you tolerated the D-grade screwball comedy of ""Ally McBeal"" then the D-grade screwball afoot here might hit the spot.Moore plays Audrey Woods a tightly wound Manhattan attorney who eats sugar when shes nervous. She tries not to be naughty (""You know I dont like spouse-bashing"" she tells one client) and is thorough in her research. Shes also the sort of uptight perfectionist who makes gaffes big enough for a man to use against her which Brosnans Daniel Rafferty does whenever possible.Hes back on the East Coast after several years practicing law in California. They frequently wind up on opposite sides of the same high-profile marital breakups -- and inevitably after a night of drinking in the same bed. Early in their relationship Audrey informs Daniel that ""there are no psychological shortcuts into my pants."" Perhaps but I dont think the movie used psychology to get him there.She doesnt believe in matrimony. And he doesnt appear to believe in anything. Yet when they wind up in Ireland to have a look at a castle that two divorcing clients want custody of they get drunk then married and spend the rest of the movie splashing in the puddle-deep irony of whether to get a divorce.They bicker and banter while we sit around and wait for the obvious verdict. At one point I forgot where I was and actually reached for the remote.New York ""ethnics"" who hover around the fringes of the story are used as wallpaper. Daniels office is in Chinatown just so Audrey can hate going there to see him. And basketball player Allan Houston turns up for a few seconds as a client. But the movies chief subplot belongs to a couple on the skids a fashion designer (Parker Posey) and a conceited English punk rock star (Michael Sheen).Sheen is a mock-lascivious cartoon Sex Pistol who seems like a classical-music listeners notion of a rock star. Posey keeps her head cocked at acute angles for the whole movie -- reliably disrespectful of the airs of decorum. If only she had played Moores part instead of Moore. ""Laws of Attraction"" helps you realize that decent movie stars can make even the most mediocre romantic comedy watchable. Unfortunately Brosnan and Moore are not those stars.Grizzled and sleepy-looking Brosnan never makes Daniel vulnerable enough to be liked. His work in this movie could pass as a failed screen test for the Coen brothers piquant divorce yarn ""Intolerable Cruelty."" Five minutes of his cocky uninflected simpering would explain why George Clooney got the part.Moore is worse. She swallows so many of her lines its tempting to think the rest of her performance suffered from indigestion. The movie repeatedly catches her trying to pass bug eyes fake stammering and a gaping mouth off as reaction shots. Its as though shed never done comedy. (Though titles such as ""Nine Months"" and ""Evolution"" suggest shes never done good comedy.)The actress cant fall back on a persona the way most movie stars do. And she doesnt do well when theres no pressure to succeed. This is a throwaway movie for her so she throws it away. Ive never seen an actor play an alleged smart person so stupidly -- which is odd. Moores great roles are her dingbats -- the hypochondriac housewife in ""Safe"" the coked-up porn mother in ""Boogie Nights"" the disillusioned homemaker in ""Far From Heaven."" Match her with a director who has style vision and talent and shes fantastic. Stick her in a turkey and she gobbles.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Laws of Attraction doesnt hold up in court By Mike Clark USA TODAY You have to admire Pierce Brosnan Julianne Moore and Frances Fisher for never giving up in Laws of Attraction. But watching actors labor so strenuously to re-create the feel of vintage Hollywood deflates the cause rather than exalts it. Tracy and Hepburn? Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore. By Bernard Walsh New Line Productions Opposing lawyers launch a battle of the sexes in courtrooms echoing the Tracy-Hepburn masterpiece Adams Rib-- which you can buy on DVD for less than a pair of movie tickets. This time the lawyers arent married at least at first. That changes after a night of drunken revelry neither remembers echoing the best Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedy Lover Come Back (new to DVD just this month). ABOUT THE MOVIE Laws of Attraction   (out of four) Stars Pierce Brosnan Julianne Moore Frances Fisher Director Peter Howitt Distributor New Line Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language Opens Friday nationwide Early on it seems that Laws might defy its derivative limitations. The movie gets out of the gate quickly but once the story elements fall into place the movie slows and the pace seems seven steps slower than the brisk opening scenes. Moore is a New York divorce lawyer who meets her media-darling equal in legal adversary Brosnan. Theres some funny stuff involving a Hostess Snowball that Moore eats to alleviate nervous tension but even that makes you wonder whether director Peter Howitt (1998s belabored Sliding Doors) can sustain even the brief 89-minute running time. The dominant subplot has Brosnan and Moore taking opposing sides in a marital split involving a sexually indiscriminate rocker (Michael Shean) and his wife (Parker Posey) both of whom are basket cases. The key sticking point in the property division is the couples Irish castle and the movie shifts in tone to indulge in local color (read pubs) when Brosnan and Moore journey to the outskirts of Dublin. Laws has only two screenwriters (Aline Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling) but it eventually comes to feels like something written by a committee with slightly different takes on what kind of comedy it should be. Yet with tangy Fisher equaling the leads in a sometimes scene-stealing role as Moores mom the actors emerge unscathed. Brosnans part in fact is among the actors most convincing non-Bond characters. The movie however is a waft of mist that isnt likely to survive what the summer movie season is about to bring. Its Adams appendix.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance.

I dont know whether such cheerful maidens stay up or at home for Saturday Night Live or if they noticed that the picture is infested with SNL luminaries on both sides of the camera -- notably Weekend Updates Tina Fey who wrote the nimble script from a nonfiction best-seller by Rosalind Wiseman with the concise title Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence and who also plays a tart-tongued teacher in the movie. Or whether they were as surprised as I was by how faithful the movie is to the basic tenets of the high school girlie movies currently proliferating like viruses on studio-release schedules. Namely that adolescent girls are every bit as mean as if not meaner than their male counterparts -- that their meanness manifests as passive aggression and verbal bitchery on a scale no pimply boy could aspire to. That the currency of status and barter among the clique elite includes Gucci and Prada preferably in shades of manic pink. And that the existential dilemma of every girl with an ounce of integrity is whether to succumb to the threats and blandishments of the airheaded in-crowd or stick with the dweeby outcasts. How the stakes have risen -- at least in the kind of high schools likely to make it into Hollywood movies -- since my day (girls high school London early 60s) when we all wore gym slips with ties and lace-up shoes and God help the girl who showed up in lipstick. In the pop culture of that period the nice girl was a straight-talking straight-As tomboy in crappy jeans the dweebs were bespectacled maidens in faded frocks hand-sewn by their mothers and the clique-y gorgons were underachieving ultrafemme Goldilocks in frilly frocks by Macys.Also in this issue Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm ELLA TAYLOR isnt above enjoying a good bar fight Moore versus Brosnan in Laws of Attraction. Today the song remains the same but the accessories have scaled up to the point of hysteria -- and why not given that parents nowadays (not just in Beverly Hills) give their daughters breast jobs as high school graduation presents? In Mean Girls Lindsay Lohan radiantly freckled but hardly nerdy in T-shirt and jeans plays Cady Heron a math wizard newly arrived in a Chicago suburb with her zoologist parents after years of homeschooling in Africa. Shes bright and personable and abysmally unprepared for the stab-as-stab-can feminine culture of North Shore High School. At first her education is supervised by the class rejects Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) an encouragingly foul-mouthed wench garbed in child-of-Elvira noir and named after the folk-rock star famous for ""At Seventeen"" one of the most lugubrious songs of teen angst ever written; and her buddy Damian (played with brio by Daniel Franzese who gets all the best lines) a chubby lad whos ""too gay to function."" Janis and Damian whose capacity for survival has been sharpened by routine persecution have the schools pernicious culture nailed. Still their warnings to Cady go unheeded when shes wooed by the weight-obsessed Gucci-clad Queen Bee Regina George (played with kittenish menace by Rachel McAdams) and her two stoolie sycophants (Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried).   Mean Girls is directed by Mark Waters who also made the hit teen comedy Freaky Friday. Watching his new film one sees how dependent that delightful movie was on its wicked premise -- a mother and daughter forced to switch bodies and lives -- and on the antic chemistry between Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis. In Mean Girls the dreadful Regina has an amusing mother too one of those awful women (deliciously rendered by SNLs Amy Poehler) who longs to be her daughters best friend and wears clothes that make her look like mutton dressed up as lamb. Shes no more than a brief sideshow though and one yearns for more of the cruel comedy of her relationship with her entertainingly unspeakable offspring. Lohan is a warm and engaging presence but shes completely outshone by the bad girls and when theyre offscreen Mean Girls is an oddly restrained barely plotted movie. Its only unifying premise is Cadys romance with Reginas amiable boyfriend (Jonathan Bennett) an afterthought with no visible personality and her dilemma over whether to lead the Math Club to victory in the championships. Its as if Waters assembled a bunch of performers -- including the wonderful Tim Meadows who plays the schools hapless principal -- who were born to be thorns in the flesh of the status quo and instructed them to remain calm at all times and pursue the happy morally uplifting ending. Thats what you get I guess for hitching Saturday Night Live to a faux self-help manual.

More like boredomFilm hits every cliche -- and the viewer over the headBy Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore play attorneys who develop a fondness for one another in ""Laws of Attraction."" YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Julianne Moore Pierce Brosnan or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The new romantic comedy ""Laws of Attraction"" is stuffed with every cliche in the book. It tries to emulate the great Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn classics but ends up a pale copy.Pierce Brosnan is charming if a bit one-dimensional as Daniel Rafferty a high-powered New York divorce attorney who goes toe-to-toe -- both in and out of the courtroom -- with his fellow divorce attorney Audrey Woods played by Julianne Moore.The plot obviously tips its pen to ""Adams Rib"" (1949) which featured Hepburn and Tracy as a married couple -- both lawyers -- who found themselves fighting each other in court over a murder case. But while that film was one of the greatest ever to explore the battle between the sexes ""Laws of Attraction"" is -- unfortunately -- just a battle against boredom.Stop me if youve heard this one before. Shes an uptight control freak who does everything by the book. Hes a free-wheeling gadabout who flies by the seat of his pants. In short they are complete opposites they hate each other at first sight and fall in love by the third act. Enough cliches for you? Wait theres more. Lack of logicOf course they find themselves on opposite sides of a highly publicized divorce case between a rich and famous rock star Thorne Jamison played by Michael Sheen and his spoiled wife Serena played by a stick-thin and forever pouting Parker Posey.The divorcing couple own a castle in Ireland and the two lawyers find themselves jetting off to the Emerald Isle to despose the castles staff regarding the ownership of the property. I find it doubtful that real lawyers would interview household servants to ascertain ownership but it does explain why Moore and Brosnan signed up for the picture. Can you say free vacation in Ireland?While in Ireland the two get drunk and wake up the next morning wearing wedding rings Theyve gotten married Now thats original. Check out the film ""Lover Come Back"" (1961) and about a dozen other movies. Back in New York the two decide to pretend to be married so they wont look like idiots to their friends and colleagues. Way too late people.Now any kind of logic goes out the window as he tries to save the ""marriage"" because -- despite his profession -- he believes in true love. Meanwhile she tries keep her real feelings under wraps. One moment hes cutting her dead in the courtroom and in the very next scene he professing undying love and saying his career means nothing compared to his love for her. Say what?All that talent for nothing Michael Sheen plays a rock star intent on divorcing his wife in ""Laws of Attraction.""This screenplay was co-written by Aline Brosh McKenna who is -- it says in the screening notes -- a magna cum laude from Harvard University with many other projects in development; and Robert Harling who wrote the play and screenplay for ""Steel Magnolias."" It just goes to show you there are no guarantees in the film business. You can have all the right elements with two very good actors and screenwriters with a great track record and still turn out an almost unwatchable movie.Robert Howitt (""Sliding Doors"") uses the sledgehammer style of directing driving home each plot point until your head hurts. The beginning of the film goes on and on setting up the conflict between the two before getting to whatever meat is contained in this tiny tale.By the time the best part of the film rolls around -- when the two are pretending to be married but are actually falling in love at the same time -- the film is well into the third act. Its too little too late. Francis Fisher does a nice turn as Audreys some-what vapid but all-knowing mother while Nora Dunn (""Saturday Night Live"") plays a no-nonsense judge who shrieks out every one of her lines. I cringed everytime she came on screen.Overall save yourself a trip to the cineplex -- not to mention nine dollars -- check out some Tracy-Hepburn films and wait for ""Laws of Attraction"" to show up on video or DVD. That is assuming youre still interested after you see ""Adams Rib.""""Laws Of Attraction"" opens nationwide on Friday April 30 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Here the sparring duo -- that once might have been played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn -- is essayed by Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore in enjoyably change-of-pace roles.

""Laws of Attraction"" plays by the rules sheet so gainfully employed in the battle-of-the-sexes comedy classics of Hollywoods golden age. Here the sparring duo -- that once might have been played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn -- is essayed by Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore in enjoyably change-of-pace roles. While slight comic concoction is so airy it seems in danger of floating right off the screen the pleasant retro vibe and a handful of effervescent moments carry this film no self-respecting heterosexual male would dare see except on a date. Opening April 30 after some fest dates decent chick-flick coin should precede many court dates as a vid and tube staple. Audrey Woods (Moore) a high-profile Manhattan divorce attorney with a penchant for candy corn believes divorce proceedings dont have to turn into nasty name-calling free-for-alls. Daniel Rafferty (Brosnan) an even higher-profile lawyer with an impeccable track record has a reputation for flying by the seat of his disheveled roguishly charming pants. They meet-cute when they find themselves representing opposing spouses in a divorce case. He invites her to dinner; she thinking she can work the situation to her advantage accepts. Then in a moment of weakness she ends up spending the night with him; the next morning he shows up in court with case notes written on her missing panties. Woods and Rafferty continue to square off on a series of headline-grabbing cases until they find themselves representing their highest profile clients to date spaced-out rock star Thorne Jamison (Michael Sheen) and his tempestuous fashion-designer wife Serena (Parker Posey). After initially courting Woods to be her advocate Serena jumps ship and decides to go with Rafferty. Woods moves in and lands Thorne as her client. Thorne and Serena pretty much agree on whos entitled to what except that is for the sprawling Irish castle they call their home away from home. So naturally its off to Dublin for our intrepid heroes where they each plan to depose the Jamisons servants in an effort to determine who deserves to keep the estate. ""Laws of Attraction"" is a welcome change-of-pace for Hollywood product runs under 80 minutes not including the lengthy main and end title sequences. Scripted by Aline Brosh McKenna and Robert Harling ""Laws of Attraction"" desperately wants to approximate the sustained screwball rhythms of a Lubitsch Hawks or Wilder farce and only very occasionally comes even close. But the charming chemistry of the leads and the lightness of tone achieved by director Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors"" ""Johnny English"") keeps the whole enterprise afloat. Liberated from his usual brand of spygame skullduggery the de-Bonded Brosnan appears wonderfully at ease while Moore relieved of the melodramatic burden of her best-known roles positively sparkles. Theyre helped by Frances Fisher as Woods conniving botox-injecting former-beauty-queen mother. In a brilliant perf Fisher amps up the entire movies energy level whenever shes on screen. Asked at one point if shes really 56 years old she replies in a Mae West-worthy retort ""Parts of me are."" Likewise pic is appropriately polished in the tech department with Adrian Biddles widescreen lensing lending the Manhattan scenes a particularly glossy glow while composer Edward Shearmur contributes a bouncy brassy Gershwinesque score that sounds like an ode to skyscrapers and taxicabs. Pics grand total of 17 producers of various types rivaled only by the ""Agent Cody Banks"" franchise suggests that such credits may have been dispensed on the set with all the discernment of crew jackets.
