The amiable family-friendly Walt Disney production is based on the Country Bears Jamboree a decades-old Audio-Animatronics extravaganza at Disney theme parks. Theres something oddly charming even refreshingly sweet about the frankly retro low-tech movie magic on display in ""The Country Bears."" The amiable family-friendly Walt Disney production is based on the Country Bears Jamboree a decades-old Audio-Animatronics extravaganza at Disney theme parks. And the title characters are played by guys in bear suits -- very spiffy bear suits designed by Jim Hensons Creature Shop but bear suits nonetheless. The players are even less persuasive than the rubber-suited reptiles in the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" pix but thats part of the fun. Toddlers and pre-teens will be entertained and parents will be pleasantly surprised by this more-than-just-bearable musical road movie which should have a long shelf life on homevid after modestly profitable theatrical exposure. Greatly expanding on the musical revue premise of the theme park show director Peter Hastings and scripter Mark Perez imagine a world where humans and talking bears co-exist more or less as equals. Not long ago an ursine ensemble of country musicians -- Ted Bedderhead Fred Bedderhead Zeb Zoober and Tennessee ONeal -- were chart-toping superstars known as the Country Bears. However excesses and in-fighting drove the band members apart. Eleven-year-old Beary Barrington (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) is the No. 1 fan of the long-defunct group regarding the Country Bears with an intensity that seems unusual even in the pics skewed view. Hes so caught up with the group that he doesnt notice hes a little different from his dad (Stephen Tobolowsky) mom (Meagan Fay) and annoying older brother (Eli Marienthal) and it takes him a long time to realize that if hes a bear and theyre human hes probably adopted. Eager to explore his roots -- and while hes at it get an up-close look at his musical heroes -Beary runs away from home. He journeys to Country Bear Hall original showcase of the Country Bears only to find the once-popular tourist attraction has been virtually forgotten. These days the only people -- er bears -- youll find there are Henry Dixon Taylor (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) museum curator and original band manager and Big Al (voiced terrifically by James Gammon) a slow-drawling caretaker. On really bad days youll also find banker Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken having the time of his life) a grudge-bearing banker who wants to foreclose on Country Bear Hall and tear it down. To save the landmark Beary encourages Henry and the bands former roadie (played as a human by M.C. Gainey) to search for the long-dispersed Country Bears and reunite the group for a benefit concert. Here and there in ""The Country Bears"" you can spot hints of ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""The Muppet Movie."" Even as the runaway Beary is pursued by two bumbling cops (Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell Diedrich Bader) the plucky little bear and his new friends search far and wide for the former bandmates often encountering real-life (and really human) musical stars in the process. One of the funniest bits involves an onstage musical duel between rockabilly master Brian Setzer and fiddle player Zeb Zoober (voiced by Stephen Root) a former Country Bear who sampled too much honey. (In the world according to ""Country Bears"" Beeweiser honey is the drink of choice in country-flavored honky-tonks.) Another highlight Ex-mates Tennessee ONeal (voiced by Toby Huss) and Trixie St. Clair (voiced by Candy Ford) reunite in a love-song duet before a barroom audience. When they warble they sound just like Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley -- who just happen to be sitting at the bar enjoying the show. Elton John and Willie Nelson are among other notables who appear in fleeting cameos while rising singers Krystal Marie Harris and Jennifer Paige are spotlighted in pleasingly elaborate production numbers. John Hiatt wrote most of the original tunes which run the gamut from plaintive Camp;W to peppy pop. Dont be surprised if the soundtrack CD is a crossover bestseller. A product of corporate synergy ""The Country Bears"" undoubtedly will be viewed with suspicion and/or condescension by many critics. But pic as a whole is a gently and genuinely amusing treat that should bring smiles to target auds. Production values are first-rate the bear costumes are impressive -- facial movements are notably expressive -- and the human co-stars dont try too hard. Well OK Walken tries very very hard -- but the overall effect is every bit as funny as his frisky feline turn in Cannon Films otherwise negligible version of ""Puss in Boots"" (1988).

"Trouble Bruin Disneys Sorry Band of Bears washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Trouble Bruin Disneys Sorry Band of Bears Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday July 26 2002 Theres a juke joint legend that Bonnie Raitt Brian Setzer John Hiatt and Willie Nelson met the Devil at a crossroads on the Mississippi Delta one midnight selling their respective souls for an undisclosed sum of money. Once the deal was sealed the parties went their separate ways. But when the musicians turned around they saw that Satan was wearing a pair of enormous white gloves red suspenders and giant mouse ears. Okay not exactly. But you cant blame a fan for wanting to confect a lyrical rationale for why these and other great performers would agree to take part in as craven an exercise as ""The Country Bears."" A spinoff of the Disney World animatronic attraction Country Bear Jamboree ""The Country Bears"" is Disneys first attempt to cash in on a tie-in between its theme parks and its film division. Which means theres plenty of time to find an excuse not to take the kids to Pirates of the Caribbean. ""The Country Bears"" is so awkward so leaden so virtually laugh-free that its guaranteed to bring down the Happy Meals its being marketed with. Things start promisingly enough. In an introductory sequence similar to VH1s scrumptious guilty pleasure ""Behind the Music"" we see the rise and fall of the Country Bears a sort of ursine cross between the Flatlanders and the Grateful Dead. (As it happens most of the band members do bear an unsettling resemblance to Jerry Garcia.) In a funny montage we see the bands debut recording (""The Album What Thats Our First"") and a tabloid headline referring to fiddle player Zeb Zoobers ""Sticky Honey Problem."" Since their breakup the Country Bears have become the stuff of legend and their most faithful cult member is a young cub named Beary Barrington (voiced by Haley Joel Osment). Beary is obsessed with the Country Bears and sets out to find happiness in Country Bear Hall where the Bears played their final show (guess the Cow Palace was booked). When he arrives the cub sees that the auditorium is soon to be demolished by the evil Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken) so Beary vows to get the Bears back together for a show to save the Hall. With its cool cameo appearances and hip soundtrack ""The Country Bears"" initially appears to be the kind of movie people who subscribe to the alt-country magazine No Depression can enjoy with their kids. But appearances are deceiving. Even choice cuts from the Byrds Lucinda Williams and Bob Dylan cant disguise the fact that youre watching a bunch of big overstuffed bears lumbering around spouting bad dialogue. (The bear puppets by the way are engineered by Jim Hensons Creature Shop which seems to have looked to ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" for inspiration.) Although ""The Country Bears"" is meant to be a satire it falls somewhere in the mushy middle ground between parody and sentimentality. On and on it goes from protracted chase scenes to shots of Walken becoming increasingly agitated to the final much-postponed concert with lots of close-ups of the films furry and well a bit mangy title characters. If youre looking for some good family interspecies entertainment take the little ones to see ""Stuart Little 2"" again; in the meantime you might want to crawl into your cave and sleep through this one. The Country Bears (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

Directed by Peter Hastings from a screenplay by Mark Perez. 88 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. Cinematic inspiration is everywhere so they say and nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Country Bears"" a feature film based on a Disneyland attraction involving artificial bears who play country music. (The Pirates of the Caribbean movie starring Johnny Depp opens in 2003. No I am not making this up.) You might reasonably expect from the mighty Disney that the big-screen bears might be kind of cutting-edge with stunningly realistic digital effects. Um no. Its guys in bear suits lumbering around with their big heads and synthetic-looking hair with dubbed voices chiming in from a sound booth. Of course ""The Country Bears"" is aimed at tiny children who arent always sticklers for high aesthetic standards. For the record though the tots at a recent preview screening made little response to the bears but audibly appreciated a human character who made noises come out of his armpit. Can a guy in a bear suit provide that kind of entertainment? I think not. ""The Country Bears"" is about young Beary a fourth-grader who feels like all Disney heroes before him that he just doesnt fit in. (Dont even think about taking a real fourth-grader to this movie unless you want to be subjected to extreme eye-rolling. Think preschool.) In Bearys case theres a good reason for feeling isolated Hes only just figured out that hes a bear in a human family. OK so maybe hes not the swiftest fourth-grader. Voiced earnestly by Haley Joel Osment whose parents probably wanted him to make a movie that didnt involve dead people Beary runs away from home to pursue his dream of reuniting his favorite musical group the Country Bears. The rest is easily sketched in the road trip in the old Country Bears bus the rounding up of the far-flung band members the triumph over the nasty guy in a fedora (Christopher Walken who must be doing one for the grandchildren) the general good feelings and requisite happy ending. At times ""The Country Bears"" resembles ""Almost Famous"" but without the drugs and sex and with bear suits; theres one scene on the bus where you can almost hear ""Tiny Dancer."" And a myriad of musical guests show up turning much of the movie into a series of bear-laden music videos. Most are unidentified with the mysterious exception of Elton John who does a cameo as a gardener. Seems like an odd choice as preschoolers arent likely to know who Elton John is. Maybe he should have made an armpit noise. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT The Country Bears nearly unbearable 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE COUNTRY BEARS Comedy. Starring Christopher Walken and Haley Joel Osment. Directed by Peter Hastings. (G. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is supposed to be the summer of G-whiz. Movie studios it is said have finally gotten the message about the need for family films and according to one survey are releasing a G or PG-rated movie once a week for the next three months. We may need more movies rated G but nobody wants them to be D for dumb. ""The Country Bears"" has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers. Unfortunately there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them either. For starters these bad news bears who are supposed to be the stars of the show never stop looking like actors in furry suits. Second the plot is as old and tired as the feeble punch lines. And finally what makes anyone think that a sound track of arena country-rock will appeal to the Britney Spears generation? There is a moment when the project teeters on the brink of something good. Eleven-year-old Beary Barrington a bear cub in T-shirt and jeans looks around the dinner table at the white-bread humans who are his mother father and brother and has a question. ""Mom"" he asks ""am I adopted?"" The idea that no one thinks any more of bears than any other nationality is a nice concept -- if only they hadnt kept hitting us over the head with it. You know it is just a matter of time before Bearys brother Dez (who looks like a human but is actually a real weasel) says something so mean that Beary runs away from home. Dez does and Beary does traveling to Country Bear Hall where his favorite group the Country Bears ""greatest bear rock band in history"" used to perform. And guess what? An evil banker (Christopher Walken) is about to foreclose on the mortgage and tear down the Hall. But wait. Beary has a brainstorm. What if they got the Country Bears back together for a concert? Hey cubs lets put on a show Beary and the Bears immediately set off on a road trip in search of big musical production numbers. One of them a fiddle-guitar showdown with former Stray Cat Brian Setzer hints at what might have been. But the rest are dreary pointless opportunities to check off the list of musical stars who signed on. Krystal Marie Harris totally rocks on ""The Kid in You"" but when Fred of the Country Bears steps up for his big harmonica solo what comes out is mediocre at best. Even for a bear. Speaking of which why bears? As we humans always say the problem with bears is they all look alike. Dress them up in vests floppy hats and wire-rim glasses -- and they did all that and more in this movie -- but who can tell one bear from another? Also between the frozen mugs on their bear faces and the idea that they all speak with the deep drawl of Eeyore in the Winnie the Pooh cartoons you dont have much room for expression. Half the fun in movies like this is the send-ups by the guest stars but Walken can only be roused to nibble -- not chew -- the scenery. And just for future reference putting Walken in bunny slippers doesnt make him funny -- just weird. Bearys voice by the way is provided by Haley Joel Osment. He was the creepy kid who kept talking about seeing dead people in ""The Sixth Sense."" You know what hell be whispering after he sees this tired effort. ""I see no sequel.""

This is a movie in which people in animatronic bear suits pretend to be real talking bears who were once members of a famous country music band and are now just aging working-stiff bears. Then a preteen bear (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) whos sad because he doesnt resemble the rest of his adopted non-bear family reunites the band through a combination of flattery and nagging. Its sort of an ursine ""The Last Waltz"" with more costumes and no direction from Martin Scorsese. The whole talking-animal thing is grisly in The Country Bears but there are some diversions. Christopher Walken delivers a singular non-Method performance as a mean (non-bear) bank manager who performs an armpit-fart version of Tchaikovskys 1812 Overture. And non-bear musicians including Elton John and Queen Latifah make cameo appearances. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
