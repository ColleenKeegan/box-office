Comments Swimfan Michael Douglass fingerprints are all over this high school thriller it was coproduced by his company Further Films; it stars Erika Christensen who played his junkie daughter in Traffic; and its script by Charles Bohl and Phillip Schneider slickly adapts Fatal Attraction (1985) to the teen-drama market. Jesse Bradford plays a swimming hero who betrays his adoring and attentive sweetheart (Shiri Appleby) during a late-night pool encounter with Christensen a spooky new classmate who has a thing for him. After their chlorinated coupling she wont take no for an answer and begins invading his school locker room his home his circle of friends and his part-time job ratcheting up the tension as a big swim meet approaches. Director John Polson mutes the conservative sexual politics of the original film focusing on the lightweight efficient suspense story; the film seems to take for granted that sex and emotional commitment are two separate things though in a country where middle school kids go down on each other perhaps I shouldnt be surprised. With Kate Burton and Dan Hedaya. 85 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for Swimfan Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

Bohl Phillip Schneider; Release Date Wide 09/06/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 84; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted September 11 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Erika Christensen gives herself over to the role of a high school femme fatale in Swimfan the way that a born sex bomb wouldnt. Shes a thoughtful alluring actress playing a sex bomb and that makes her far more erotic - and fascinating - to watch than the latest teen babe du jour. As Madison Bell a new student from somewhere down South who fixates on the hottest jock in class the earnest swim champ Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) Christensen looks more voluptuous than she did in ""Traffic"" and the fleshiness only heightens her appeal. Her face framed by Pre-Raphaelite curls is circular and creamy soft with an upper lip as curvy as a longbow and eyes that are like the two biggest marbles youve ever seen. Those bewitching orbs have a way of holding on to an adoring look of love a beat or two longer than they should and that gives her the quality of a slightly possessed baby doll. If countless young actresses have evoked Marilyn Monroe Christensen in ""Swimfan"" recalls something far more eerie and ambiguously enticing Shes like the living embodiment of an Andy Warhol Marilyn portrait. Madison who plays the cello is immensely sensitive and intelligent far too forceful a personality to ever speak in icky catchphrases like ""You are soooo busted"" Shes a bad girl disguised as a good girl and she knows just how to nab a star athlete?by turning seduction into a contest. Its not hard to see why Ben despite the fact that he has a cute and worshipful girlfriend (who does say things like ""You are soooo busted"") couldnt resist the charms of this smolderingly self-aware teen angel. When Madison gets Ben alone at night in the school swimming pool she forces him to say ""I love you"" right in the middle of sex which is a hell of a mind game. At that moment its not at all clear to him that he doesnt mean it. ""Swimfan"" a junior-varsity ""Fatal Attraction"" starts out well with Jesse Bradford from ""Bring It On"" gawking just avidly enough to suggest Carson Daly with a brain transplant; its easy to get on his sap-hero wavelength. But the script having presented Ben as a diligent overachiever attempts to give him a secret dark side by establishing that he went through a battle with drugs and Bradford unlike Michael Douglas shows no inner sleaze. Ben backs out of the affair virtually the moment he dips into it and so unfortunately does the movie. Thrown into a rage the jilted Madison employs a few innovative harassment gambits like sending her nude photograph to Ben on a school computer. But she quickly turns into a homicidal superbitch who eliminates her foes leaving fewer traces than a Mob hitman. The sexy cleverness of Christensens performance too seems to disappear in a trace. ""Swimfan"" is proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot expertly cast paced with crisp professionalism...and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterdays weather report.

This review was updated on Sept. 9 2002. John Polsons ""Swimfan"" is the latest to take a dip into the waters of ""Fatal Attraction""-like obsessive love with the twist being that players are teenagers who behave like so many consenting adults in Gap clothing. Its estimated 12 million opening weekend notwithstanding pic doesnt look to stay afloat very long before paddling its way to the video store. Pic focuses on Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) a champion high school swimmer with a suitably attractive girlfriend Amy (Shiri Appleby). Enter Madison Bell (Erika Christensen) the ""new girl in town"" about whom nobody knows anything and who lives in a weird Dickensian mansion complete with a creepy aunt (Phyllis Somerville) and partially deaf cousin (James Debello). Of course our young innocent Ben falls victim to the new girls charms and they have a one-night-stand in the high school swimming pool. And of course Madison promises Ben that no one should ever speak of this incident again that theyll just pretend it never happened. But Madison doesnt just go away; in fact shes louder and clearer than before leaving Ben notes jamming his e-mail inbox with hundreds of messages and even bringing birthday flowers to Bens mom (Kate Burton). When all that isnt enough to win Ben ""back"" Madison goes about sabotaging Bens life from his relationship with Amy to his athletic career. And she somehow manages to get away with all this without leaving so much as a shred of incriminating evidence.Indeed ""Swimfan"" is a chiller resolutely without chills in which even the pool water always seems heated. And inasmuch as the pic never owns up to its own trashiness its not even enjoyable camp -- like Mary Lamberts recent ""The In-Crowd"" -- even though theres about as much underage drinking heavy petting and full-on sex as you can imagine this side of a very surprising PG-13 rating. And ""Swimfan"" doesnt stop there Bens skills in larceny end up savingthe day which pretty much quashes any chance the film has at being perceived as a cautionary tale. The good news is that the pics running time of 84 minutes is mercifully brief and the film is a fine showcase for Christensen who played Michael Douglas daughter in ""Traffic."" Also the frequent underwater photography courtesy of lenser Giles Nuttgens (""The Deep End"") and underwater d.p. Gary Shlifer is well accomplished.
