Feel-good celebration of youth and old age enriching each other is leavened with humor. Should fare respectably well after its kickoff in a market ostensibly starved for good family entertainment. A 1960s-set family pic about a city tween dumped on two countrified old uncles ""Secondhand Lions"" may score higher with parents than the kids they bring in tow. Writer-director Tim McCanlies (""Dancer Texas Pop. 81"") feel-good celebration of youth and old age enriching each other is carefully leavened with humor. Although McCanlies deft sense of comic timing doesnt always disguise the hoariness of the gags and his failure to flesh out the storys darker aspects flattens pics dramatic arc ""Lions"" still should fare respectably well after its Sept. 19 kickoff in a market ostensibly starved for good family entertainment. Saddled with a flighty mother (Kyra Sedgwick) with lousy taste in men young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is thrust into the unwilling arms of two crusty great-uncles Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine). The welcome mat to their retreat consists of increasingly apocalyptic signs warning of explosives rabid dogs and nuclear radioactivity and exhorting all would-be visitors ""Turn Back Now."" When Walter arrives a wild pack of mismatched dogs and an overeager pig swarm him and he becomes disconcerted by his uncles idea of a good time -- shooting at traveling salesmen drawn by tales of their great wealth. But soon enough Walter (in the absence of a television set) becomes fascinated by the pair. Hub and Garths vast fortune is alternately rumored to come from bank robberies Mafia funds stolen from Al Capone or according to the uncles themselves gold tricked from an evil sheik. Caine and Duvall delightfully knock off their lines with the syncopated brio of a first-class vaudeville team. Caine spins improbable yarns of the duos exploits in Africa accompanied by dazzling snatches of scimitar-wielding derring-do enacted by Christian Kane and Kevin Michael Haberer as younger versions of Hub and Garth with Hub cast in the heroic role while Garth as sidekick furnishes ironic asides. Hubs adventures soon mutate into a love story that still haunts Duvall as an old man and Walt wants nothing more than to solve the puzzle of what happened to his lady fair the Princess Jasmine. These brightly colored rapid forays into bygone times with their rows of uniformed legionnaires and endless supplies of black-swathed assassins are unlikely to impress a post-""Matrix"" generation but the flashbacks contrast well in Jack Greens lensing of David Bombas production design with the homey weathered look of the uncles farm in Texas a Gothic ramshackle folly amid peaceful greenery and rippling water. Prologue and epilogue set in the 90s recount the further exploits of the two indomitable old men. Osment at that tricky pre-pubescent transitional age from child star to juve mostly stays a cipher the haunted emptiness that served him well in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" never fully translating into the ""scared life-scarred kid who must learn to trust."" Part of the problem stems from a lack of visual support. Alone in a strange dark place with just a hurricane lamp for light Osments fear can register solely on his face -- there are no flickering lights on staircases or spooky shadows in corners. In a 180-degree departure from his excellent script for the animated ""Iron Giant"" McCanlies here shows a tendency to resolve conflict too quickly sabotaging the sense of childhood terror he is striving to create. Even artfully timed gags meant to defuse tension appear corny when that tension barely has a chance to build. But McCanlies has no problems with childhoods small epiphanies most of a gently farcical persuasion the fun of planting rows of different vegetables that all turn out to be corn; the thrill of a fight between Hub and a switchblade-waving quartet of teens that the unarmed old warrior wins hands down. Tech credits especially Greens photography are top-notch though Patrick Doyles sweetly imperialistic score is an acquired taste. Lovely end credits animated over ""Calvin and Hobbes""-type comic strip panels are supposedly drawn by now-adult cartoonist Walter.

Starring Robert Duvall Michael Caine and Haley Joel Osment. Directed and written by Tim McCanlies. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Secondhand Lions"" Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Garth and Hub ornery Texas bachelors who grudgingly accept temporary guardianship of Walter (Haley Joel Osment) their shy and sheepish 14-year-old grand-nephew. Theyre crazy old coots given to sitting on their porch sipping iced tea and taking aim at the traveling salesman who keeps sniffing around after hearing of their purported millions. Walter abandoned by his trampy flaky mom (Kyra Sedgwick) is spooked by the trigger-happy grumps but gradually warms to their idiosyncrasies and tales of adventure in the French Foreign Legion. Walter having discovered mementos of Duvalls onetime exotic romance wonders if the Legionnaire yarns arent faked. ""Just because something aint true dont mean you cant believe in it"" Duvall replies -- a twisted sentiment. Boosting the movies ""ahhh"" moments the wacky uncles also keep a menagerie of five inseparable dogs and one pig to which they add an aging mail-order lion (hence the title). Theyd just as soon shoot the ragged critter but Osment the movies bleeding heart begs them to spare the beast. McCanlies the screenwriter of the animated hit ""The Iron Giant"" makes a genial but disappointing directing debut with this coming-of-age schmaltz fest. Caine and Duvall are expert but the movie strains too hard for cockeyed whimsy and Osment too old for his part is less than convincing as a wide- eyed impressionable naif. Hes at the awkward stage beyond childhood but not ready for young romantic leads. Most child actors dont finesse the transition -- Jodie Foster and Drew Barrymore are exceptions -- and if Osment makes any more mistakes like ""Secondhand Lions"" he could join the sad ranks of former child stars. -- Edward Guthmann THE FIGHTING TEMPTATIONS Comedy with music. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Beyonce Knowles and the OJays. Directed by Jonathan Lynn. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""The Fighting Temptations"" announces its priorities from the first scene with a gospel choir rocking the floor boards of a small church in rural Georgia. The music is glorious; the scene is exuberant and edging toward frenzy and everyone is exultant and moving in the spirit. ""The Fighting Temptations"" is all about such musical numbers and the rest of it is just a clothesline to hang them on. For the most part its a sturdy clothesline providing despite a few sags a warm comic story thats fairly engaging even when no one is singing. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Darrin Hill a New York advertising executive whose life is foundering in lies petty fraud and unpaid debt. Partly to avoid his creditors he heads south to attend the funeral of a beloved aunt -- and then decides to stay when he finds out theres something in it for him His aunts will stipulates that if he leads the church choir in a regional competition he will inherit stock worth 150000. Like the similarly named Harold Hill in ""The Music Man"" Darrin is a softhearted faker who inspires a small town to dream. But his usual pattern of taking the money and running becomes less attractive to him once he meets the woman of his dreams right there in rural Georgia. Beyonce Knowles plays a single mom who also does a sultry singing act in the towns hot spot. Knowles is the main musical attraction of the film -- she sings ""Fever"" as though she were Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"" putting the blame on Mame plus a number of traditional gospel tunes. The OJays also appear as townspeople who join the choir and gospel legends such as Shirley Caesar and the Blind Boys of Alabama playing themselves also perform. Gooding doesnt sing but his buoyant energy is in keeping with the music and his comedic skill is considerable. Hes ably supported in the New York scenes by Dakin Matthews who plays Darrins boss with impeccable comic timing. - This film contains a couple of mild sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle DEMONLOVER Thriller. Starring Chloe Sevigny Connie Nielsen and Gina Gershon. Directed by Olivier Assayas. (Not rated. 117 minutes. At the Lumiere) . A thriller in need of Sandra Bullock Ashley Judd or someone else to root for ""Demonlover"" is well-scripted well-acted and occasionally sexy but just isnt all that interesting. The film focuses on Diane (Connie Nielsen) who works for a huge French corporation called VolfGroup. We meet her during a plane trip where she orchestrates the drugging and mugging of a colleague so she can take over a big account. It soon becomes apparent that Diane isnt what she seems -- nobody is in ""Demonlover"" -- and the next 110 minutes are spent following her life-or-death maneuvering with love interest Herve (Charles Berling) American businesswoman Elaine (Gina Gershon) and long-suffering assistant Elise (Chloe Sevigny). ""Demonlover"" aspires to be about sex murder Japanese animation and corporate game-playing -- with the women doing most of the double- and triple- crossing -- but the movie often fails to make sense. While the actors are game for wherever the plot takes them the audience is left wondering why this collection of characters is willing to lie rape and kill over the subject of VolfGroups big deal -- a few bad pornographic cartoons. As the film meanders gleefully to Internet torture Web sites and other forms of sexual brutality nobody seems shocked or concerned. Director and writer Olivier Assayas is skilled with handling actors and making a little money go far (the film manages to create the illusion that events take place in France the United States and Japan -- even though most of it appears to have been shot in empty hotel rooms). A pivotal dinnertime confrontation between Diane and Herve is particularly nuanced and the partially subtitled film shuffles between three languages (French Japanese and English) without breaking stride. What Assayas lacks is the ability to make the viewer care about his characters even as the movie takes some interesting turns. None of the main players in ""Demonlover"" seem to have families or lives outside of screwing one another over which makes it easier to feel indifferent about their fates. Maybe its a French thing but all of the leads in ""Demonlover"" seem clinically depressed. After a while theres nothing for the audience to do but feel the same way.- This film contains graphic sex scenes adult language and violence. -- Peter Hartlaub MAMBO ITALIANO Comedy. Starring Luke Kirby Peter Miller Paul Sorvino Ginette Reno. Directed by Emile Gaudreault. Written by Steve Galluccio and Gaudreault. (R. 88 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) . The mega hit ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" reopened the closet doors to broad ethnic humor. That film was subtle compared with ""Mambo Italiano"" a coming- out comedy that mines every cliche of cloistered Italian culture. But like ""Greek Wedding"" ""Mambo"" has enough funny moments to save it. Characters smack one another on the back of the head and yell ""basta"" as cloying string music keeps telling us ""These people are Italian."" The movie is set in Montreals Little Italy in the present but it could be the 1950s with Mama in flour-sack dresses young women in teased hair and tight clothes and parents smiting their foreheads because their grown sons want to move out of the house. The homosexuality of lead character Angelo (Luke Kirby) is supposed to modernize the picture but the gay plotline seems more like a device amid all the paisano antics. Anything ""other"" would have set off Angelos shrieking family -- at least his lover Nino (Peter Miller) is Italian. The gay element seems especially flat because the Angelo character is barely likable. First he outs his cop lover against his wishes then berates his parents (Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno) for their small minds and constrained lives. Filmmaker Emile Gaudreault hasnt done enough to establish Angelo as a nice guy before the family crisis starts. The freshest moments come from the guys respective families trying to one- up each other even in their horror that their sons are gay. Angelos parents engage in a heated argument with Ninos mother about whos the dominant partner in the gay couple. Sorvino and Reno bring a lived-in bickering affection to their roles that offsets the caricatured elements. Gaudreault and co-writer Steve Galluccio pack the movie with jokes and about half of them are at least mildly funny. There are a few humdingers like a brief hilarious speech at the headquarters of a gay phone help line. Its also a nice conceit that Angelo a travel agent who dreams of being a TV writer pens scripts that are truly terrible. Kirby has a fresh-faced appeal that sees his character through his flaws and Millers enigmatic quality suits a guy who might not really be gay. But the leads are required to be tortured by their homosexuality and thus not very funny. Miller actually has more chemistry with sassy Sophie Lorain as an alpha female out to make Nino straight ""Give me an hour in the gay village and there wont be a gay village no more."" ""Mambo Italiano"" lacks any violence -- other than those smacks to the head - - and the sexuality is discreet so the R rating must have come from its gratuitous language. Characters say the f-word like theyre in ""Reservoir Dogs"" -- a curious choice for a quaint family comedy. - This film contains sexual situations raw language. - Carla Meyer SMALL VOICES Drama. Starring Alessandra de Rossi Dexter Doria Gina Alajar Amy Austria and Bryan Homecillo. Directed by Gil Portes. Written by Gil Portes Adolfo Alix Jr. and Senedy Que. (Not rated. 105 minutes. Tagalog with English subtitles. At the Lumiere Shattuck in Berkeley Metro Center in Colma and the Towne 3 in San Jose.) . Its too bad only one foreign film usually gets attention at the Academy Awards. Scores of countries submit entries every year -- and every year the submissions are pared down to a select winner (this year ""Nowhere in Africa"") while the rest are often left behind lucky to get any mention. Fortunately the Philippines 2003 entry ""Small Voices"" has been picked up for American distribution giving U.S. audiences a chance to check out this movie about a young idealistic teacher who works with children in a poor village. At times dramatic sweet funny and sentimental ""Small Voices"" almost seems like a fable -- except that its based on a real story and includes a subplot threaded with violence. Melinda Santiago (Alessandra de Rossi) faces stiff resistance from parents and fellow teachers when shortly after taking the job she tries to enter her class in a regional singing contest. Santiagos corrupt and cynical colleagues arent used to someone who questions school policies and uses resolve and creative measures (like selling ice candy to villagers) to support class projects. Although Santiagos students are excited about practicing for the vocal competition their parents say it needlessly cuts into their kids time for house chores and farming duties. One mother threatens to take her daughter out of class because ""youll (eventually) just marry and have kids."" ""Small Voices"" addresses issues that transcend Filipino culture and the setting and characters may even seem familiar to those who enjoy the work of Satyajit Ray and other directors who are considered humanist filmmakers. But Gil Portes -- a Philippine-born-and-raised director and screenwriter who now lives in New York -- includes many details that are unique including the guerrilla insurgency that draws in the father of two students. Perhaps the biggest blemish of this touching film are the white subtitles that are occasionally hard to read. - This film contains scenes of dead bodies. -- Jonathan Curiel IN THIS WORLD Drama. Starring Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. Written by Tony Grisoni. (R. 90 minutes. In Dari Farsi and other languages with English subtitles. At the Metreon.) . Theyre usually just nameless people cited in U.N. documents or newspaper briefs about human cargo. Whether its Chinese immigrants caught on ships bound for America or Turks and Iraqis found in big-rig containers heading for Europe these illegal immigrants keep risking their lives in search of a better home. With ""In This World"" director Michael Winterbottom puts an empathetic face on the problem dramatizing the plight of two Afghans who leave the squalor of Pakistan for the promise of London. Employing a technique more common to Iranian filmmakers than those in the West Winterbottom puts nonactors in the main roles. In fact the two Afghans who star in ""In This World"" are refugees whose lives mirror the ones they portray in this sensitive and illuminating work. Jamal Udin Torabi whose character is named Jamal and Enayatullah whose character is named Enayat (many Afghans have just one name) lived in Pakistan when they were tabbed by Winterbottoms crew. Their lack of English and affectation give the film its realism and so does Winterbottoms sweeping camera work which shows the two Afghans going overland from Peshawar Pakistan (on the border with Afghanistan) to Irans capital Tehran to the mountains of Turkey and onward. The footage of peaks and open-road terrain is stunning. Make no mistake though While Jamal and Enayat succeed in embarking on an epic journey (thanks to paying off human traffickers) they are forced along the way to spends days in shabby pathetic ""hotel"" rooms. Their time hiding in the backs of fruit and animal trucks isnt any better. Everywhere they go authorities seem to be nearby. In short Jamal and Enayat go through hell to leave conditions that are also hellish. Winterbottoms last film the jaunty funny ""24 Hour Party People"" was about Manchesters musical heyday. Where that movie showcased fame sex excess and narcissism ""In This World"" profiles conditions that many Westerners would rather ignore. Winterbottom is a credit to his profession -- someone who doesnt fit easy categorization and someone who lets his conscience dictate his projects. By humanizing an immigrant/refugee crisis that is not abating Winterbottom does a cinematic service that happens to be damn interesting too. - This film contains a scene of an animal killing. -- Jonathan Curiel CET AMOUR-LA French romance. Starring Jeanne Moreau and Aymeric Demarigny. Directed by Josee Dayan. Written by Josee Dayan. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . Harold and Maude play it straight in this French -- very French -- take on an autumn/spring relationship. Legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau whom Orson Welles once called simply ""the greatest actress in the world"" is onscreen for virtually every second of this take on the end of the life of prolific writer Marguerite Duras. Moreau now 75 can still command the camera. At times she glares into the lens and dares you to suggest that she cant play the romantic lead. Hey you tell her the rest of us are too intimidated. But her moonstruck lover Yann (Aymeric Demarigny) seems equally overpowered by the Moreau steamroller. Some of it is the role she is playing. As shown here Duras is a bossy obstinate mercurial diva whose social graces werent improved by alcoholism. She is given to statements like ""I am incredibly talented. That is a fact."" The idea is that Yann is so awed by her gift that he is willing to overlook everything the difference in their ages her moods and fits and the loss of any sense of his own life just to be with her. But as Yann Demarigny looks like Harry Potters older brother and acts like a lovesick puppy. Since he and Moreau are pretty much the entire cast he doesnt give the Duras character much to play against. As the film drags on and Duras health begins to fail their relationship seems more unlikely than ever. It seems inconceivable that this young man would put his life on hold to spend every waking moment with this jealous possessive combative old woman. Except of course that it is a true story. Yann Andrea a college student became so infatuated with Duras then 65 that he wrote her as many as five letters a day for five years. When they met he moved in with her ministered to her demons and helped to coax one last great book ""The Lover"" from her. And then when she died Andrea found he had learned the writing craft from her. He wrote the novel on which this movie is based. It is a great story but it hasnt been translated to the screen. It is never a good sign when the biographical notes have more emotional wallop than the movie. - Adult themes and drinking. -- C.W.

Said kid grows up a bit and learns a lot from the old coots.(Related item See a clip from Secondhand Lions) Michael Caine left and Robert Duvall star in Secondhard Lions. The movie though predictable and formulaic is not that simple although it might have been better off had it been so basic. It interweaves cliches from several other genres and ends up a mishmash of stories. Lions is saved to some degree by veterans Michael Caine (in a spotty Texan accent) and Robert Duvall. When having fun with their roles theyre at their best. But there are too many leaden moments and odd shifts in tone to keep Lions from winning us over. More about the movie Secondhand Lions   (out of four) Stars Robert Duvall Michael Caine Haley Joel Osment Kyra Sedgwick Director Tim McCanlies Distributor New Line Cinema Rating PG for thematic material language and action violence Opens today nationwide The sluggish pace is not helped by Haley Joel Osments rather awkward transition into adolescence. A naturally gifted actor in previous films here he seems a bit blank as if he doesnt quite know what to make of things. But who can blame him? The screenplay is all over the map. It starts out like an old-fashioned family drama with some comic moments; then it gets a bit slapstick and segues into fantasy-style segments that seem lifted from action films like The Mummy or Indiana Jones. At another point the boy is imperiled and the creepy thriller The Stepfather comes to mind. Osment plays Walter a 14-year-old whose flighty and neglectful single mom (Kyra Sedgwick) leaves him with his eccentric and taciturn great-uncles for a summer while she ostensibly goes off to school but in reality she hopes to nab a husband. Promising to come back she instructs him to search the old geezers house for a rumored cache of a million bucks. Garth (Caine) the younger of the two brothers warms up to Walter first. The gruff Hub (Duvall) is remote and has a mysterious habit of sleepwalking. Walter finds a hidden picture of a beautiful woman and persuades Garth to fill him in on Hubs past. Garth narrates far-fetched stories of exotic travel the Foreign Legion and Arabian princesses. Walter is on a lonely search for the truth Whats Hubs real story? (Garths is inexplicably and conspicuously ignored.) He also doesnt know what to make of the many lies his mother tells him. Secondhand Lions presumably is meant to be a sweet coming-of-age tale and the values imparted by the aging uncles are solid honor respect love for animals the rewards of hard work. Perhaps if writer/director Tim McCanlies had not strayed from this pared-down premise he might have fashioned something that resonated more deeply. His screenplay for 1999s animated gem The Iron Giant shows hes got it in him.

If you can get past all that...well it still isnt very good despite a compelling message about the all-important intergenerational bequest of tales - tall true or both. Haley Joel Osment now 15 and dressed in what appear to be Wil Wheatons hand-me-downs plays Walter a teenager so awkward he seems to be suffering from joint problems. (Maybe thats just how kids walked in the early 60s.) Hes a mamas boy with the wrong mama (Kyra Sedgwick Southern-fried and floozy-fied) She abandons Walter at the dilapidated Texas ranch of great-uncles Hub (the thunderous Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine corralling a highly unstable twang) reclusive shotgun-toting eccentrics with far-fetched stories of hard-won Arab treasures to account for their mysterious wealth. ""Just because something may or may not be true doesnt mean you shouldnt believe in it"" Hub counsels Walter. But with no baseline ""truth"" to be found among the cartoony characters and cheesy twists the whole production feels like a Texas-size load of secondhand lyin.

(CNN) -- ""Secondhand Lions"" is an uneven but ultimately satisfying tale due in large part to the amazing talents of Michael Caine Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment. Kyra Sedgwick plays Mae a well-meaning but ultimately thoughtless woman who one summer in the early 1960s unceremoniously dumps her son Walter (Osment) at his great-uncles dusty Texas ranch. The highly eccentric old-timers Hub (Duvall) and Garth (Caine) MaCaan wile away their days shooting at traveling salesmen lured to the ranch by rumors of the mens great wealth. Rumors abound as to how the men obtained their money with speculation ranging from bank robbery to Mafia hit men. Mae tells Walter to find the money then heads off to what she says is court-reporting school leaving the 14-year-old to cope on his own with two old men hes never seen before in his life. Hub and Garth feel theyve outlived their usefulness and are just hanging around the old homestead waiting to die. The young boy feels rejected by his mother who never keeps her promises to him. Exotic tales fire imagination Little by little the cranky old coots and the lost boy reach out to each other and begin to bond. Garth starts to spin amazing tales of his and Hubs days in the French Foreign Legion in North Africa and about Hubs lost love a beautiful Arabian princess. The stories are told in flashback and are shot in the style of old 40s and 50s serials. The exotic tales electrify Walters imagination. When he asks if the stories are true Hub tells him ""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most."" In reality Hub is telling him that some ""true things"" such as money and power arent as important as honor and valor and holding yourself up to a higher standard. The two teach Walter how to be a man and he teaches them how to take a second chance at life. Unwittingly the old men and the young boy provide each other with what they sought the most -- to feel wanted and needed. Director draws on Texas roots Writer-director Tim McCanlies (screenwriter for ""The Iron Giant"" 1999) is a fifth-generation Texan and that background shows in this lovingly shot drama that captures the feel of Central Texas from a bygone era. Kyra Sedgwick plays Mae a well-meaning but irresponsible mother. Unfortunately the cutting between the mens early years and the main story is somewhat jarring. But whenever Caine Duvall or Osment is on-screen the movie flows like warm butter. Watching Caine and Duvall at work is a true pleasure. These two pros are still at the top of their game and their performances are picture-perfect. At 15 Haley is starting to play more mature roles. The challenge will be finding them as he approaches adulthood while avoiding a Macaulay Culkin-type burnout. In an overcrowded sea of Oscar wannabes and high-budgeted productions this film offers an alternative a movie the whole family can enjoy. ""Secondhand Lions"" opens nationwide Friday.
