The hunter and the hunted. A Michael Mann crime classic. But enough about Heat what of Manns latest offering? This chronicle of 1930s bank robber John Dillinger and the efforts of J Edgar Hoovers federal agents to take him out is headlined by a steelier-than-usual Johnny Depp who convinces as the wily and ruthless thief. Manns film is an ambitious fresco of Depression-era America where a string of armed robberies is grabbing the headlines and prompting a highly publicised crime-fighting operation directed more towards elimination than justice - significantly new federal powers designed to assist the investigation also threaten the mobs lucrative cross-country gambling activities.Its a fascinating moment in history and Mann captures the cars the guns and the buildings with painstaking immersive authenticity. Then he has cameraman Dante Spinotti shoot it in widescreen digital video (with white-out windows it looks deliberately digital too) so creating a 30s crime flick with an in-the-moment immediacy quite unlike other period reconstructions. Were right there on the running board as the getaway cars screech down the streets...Impressive though it is the film would be more thrilling if we had any genuine emotional connection to the characters. We end up knowing more about the social and political context for the crime spree than we do about the motivations of the key players Depps Dillinger is driven by some generalised desire to escape his moll Marion Cotillard merely sketched in Christian Bales square-jawed lawman Melvin Purvis implacable in carrying out his duties. Elliot Goldenthals orchestral score strikes up to suggest some tragedy unfolding but were just not swept up in it - and the Bush-era resonance in the human-rights questions posed by the feds brutal tactics isnt sufficient compensation.As in Manns Miami Vice theres a worrying feeling that the movies just skating over our feelings without really gathering much traction. Its an event movie of course yet as Mann continues to lock himself into handheld DV mode it does seem as if much of the poise and nuance has gone out of his filmmaking.

As a journalist I did stories with the man who put together the collection of Dillinger items that Depp and Mann studied while making the movie. I loved the movie and I think it was far more truthful than many critics have indicated. Dillinger was a poor Hoosier who learned social skills from the movies. I think Depps portrayal was much like many desparate mid-western young men of the time. Life was brutal and it created brutal individuals. Life was moment to moment without plan or thought beyond the next few hours. I think with Billie Dillinger wondered for a moment if something else was possible. As he sat in the movie on the night he died I suspect he realized it was not.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 26 2010VerbSapFeaturedaEUR~Violence is as American as blueberry pieaEUR(tm) and this film is yet another illustration of that saying. Factually the film is nearly 100% accurate. Emotionally it completely misrepresents Dillinger in the interests of pandering to that combination of sentimentality and admiration of brute force that makes up the dark underside of the American psyche. Dillinger a bully as a child and a sociopath as an adult is portrayed as aEUR"" well really quite a nice guy. The director represents this serial whoremaster as touchingly devoted partner to his rather sweet girlfriend aEUR~BillieaEUR(tm). The fact that as the film correctly states Dillinger was finally gunned down after an evening out with a couple of prostitutes might seem to some of us to be at odds with that image. But director Mann for whom aEUR~ironyaEUR(tm) is evidently what you do to remove creases from a shirt takes this all in his stride leaving us with the only factual inaccuracy of the film DillingeraEUR(tm)s aEUR~last wordsaEUR(tm) (never actually uttered) for Billie delivered by one of the G-men in a cloyingly sickly final scene. In a further unconscious irony the man who orchestrated the manhunt for Dillinger Melvin Purvis is portrayed here as the real psychopath. He is humourlessly stated to have died by his own hand in 1960 and we are presumably meant to believe that his inner demons finally destroyed him and that DillingeraEUR(tm)s romantically free spirited attitude to life is best after all. The facts that Purvis was treated abominably by the jealous Hoover after his success with Dillinger and that his shooting was probably an accident with a faulty firearm are ignored in the interests of this shoddy piece of posthumous public relations. The take home lesson? Watch the film and understand how it is that the US can continue to admire and support the gang of sociopaths currently running the state of Israel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 16 2009Rob CFeaturedI was looking forward to the movie and went to see it before reading this review. I have to say that the review is spot on although perhaps a touch too positive. The film is very dull and it is impossible to become emotionally attached to any character. It is overly long and could easily have been cut by half an hour by just reducing the number of scenes with guys just pointlessly shooting at one another without any success at all for hours on end. As with most Mann films it looked great but was so far up its own backside the characters and story got completely lost.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2009CappybearFeaturedI thought this film was pretty good; Johnny Depp oozes charm Marion Cotillard looks stunning and the sets seemed authentic. As for the charge that the characters lacked depth I think we saw enough to know that Dillinger lived for the present and made the most of it whereas Agent Purvis probably lived with his mother and drank nothing stronger than milk. The film is a tad overlong; otherwise well worth seeing. My wife enjoyed it too.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 10 2009Val DemiseFeaturedI wont deny that I was a little disappointed with the movie. the script was made up with alot of small talk and the relationship between John Dillinger and whatever the girl was called was very unbelievable by which I mean its not likely the girl would fall for a man who immediatly says hes a very famous and possobly dangerous theif.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 10 2009critiqueFeaturedThis bears many similarities with Mann`s classic `Heat` but isn`t in the same league as that benchmark. . There is precious little depth to any of the characters with Purvis and Baby Face Nelson in particular criminally under-developed. The action sequences are outstanding as impressive as anything you will ever see in a cinema but this could have been so much more with an improved script and richer characterisation.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2009Bo_NidleFeaturedI have been a fan of Michael Mann since I saw his first film ""Thief"" way back in 1981. I have to admit his later efforts such as ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice"" have left me wanting a return to the days of ""Heat"" when he reached the height of his powers. So is ""Public Enemies"" a return to these heights? I would have to say Not Quite. This is not to say that PE is not a good film it is. It is just lacking the sense of grandeur and style of his earlier works. The portrayal of Dillinger by Depp is very good. The sense of his recklessness and pure ""adrenaline junky"" attitude comes across well. He revels in his reputation living a life of anti-stardom almost akin to the screen gangsters of the films of the era he so obviously enjoys. Bale on the other hand is so bland as to almost disappear. This lad needs to seriously lighten up a little as his screen performances are becoming so dull as to be lifeless. The films action set pieces are very well done but then one does expect this of a director with Manns reputation. His legendary attention to detail all to evident from the clothes worn to the weapons used. This has become a Mann trademark. However the story takes some major liberties with history. ""Pretty Boy Floyd"" did die at the hands of a unit lead by Purvis but this was several months after Dillinger. Homer van Meter (Dorff) died in an alleyway in St Paul Minnesota after a brief gunfight with Police also after Dillinger. Lester ""Baby face nelson"" Gillis also died some months after Dillinger in a shootout with FBI agents. To show them dieing in the FBI shootout at the Little Bohemia Lodge was really playing fast and loose with the facts. In fact the only people apprehended there by Purvis and his men were the gangs girlfriends. It was a monumental failure for Purvis whis resulted in the deaths of three innocent men in the car that was leaving and was fired upon. A moment shown in the film but never made quite clear as to what had happened. So how should PE be judged? As a totally accurate biopic of Dillinger it fails on some counts but scores well on others such as the portrayal of the escape from the Crown Point jail in Indiana using a wooden ""gun"" and the media circus surrounding him at the time. But his foray into the Dillinger Unit office at the Police Hq is pure fiction and I thought a scene that could easily have been left out of the film. Did I enjoy it? ( because it reads like I didnt doesnt it). Yes I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was filmed on digital and this has been much maligned by critics and although I thought it gave the film a ""you are there"" look to it I would prefer the classic look that his look that his cinematographer Dante Spinotti showed in such mann films as ""Manhunter"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans"". As said the action pieces are excellent the pacing is good and the characters come across well. It does show the naive ineptitude of the fledgling FBI very accurately (Yes they really were that bad). So all in all a bit of a mixture with the result coming out as being very good. If you know anything about Dillinger you may be left a little disappointed. If you go to it wanting a rattling good crime epic showing how insane the the early 30s crime wave was then youll enjoy it. So take the Mrs and she can lust after Depp while you enjoy the firefights.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 3 2009constanceFeaturedI dont agree with the reviewers comment about ""skating over our feelings"" and not caring for the characters I think Marion Cotillard gives a great performance....and how fantastic is it to see a Donnie Brasco style Johnny Depp again he hasnt performed like this for so long. the look of it did take me about 5 minutes to get used to but once youre in there its unlike anything youve seen I think embracing digital will create a new cinematic experience.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 2 2009ARCHGATEFeaturedAwesome. Amazing. Fantastic. The acting by Depp abd Cotillard is top notch. At last Mann has injected some genuine emotion to counterpoint the action. Cant wait to see this again.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 2 2009TrevirFeaturedSaw the film earlier today. Some terrific performances and one that is not mentioned in the review is our own Stephen Graham playing Baby Face Nelson. Steals the film by far. When you look at this alongside recent menacing performances like Combo in This is England and Franner in Liverpool gangster film The Crew he has to be acknowledged as one of the UKs leading actorsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2009usman khawajaFeaturedUltimately American cinema has coughed up an instant classic ending the drought for quality and quintessential stylised artistry which was a landmark for Hollywood in the 40s -60sand it is rather surreal this exquisite endeavour is set in the post-depression america translating the story of the master criminal Dillinger his half breed lover BILLIE and the FBI agent on their trail across the sweeping midwest vistas which are turned into mellifluous montages of spectacular and harmoniously measured gunfights which are composed with a remarkable calm and assured style by the masterful execution of mr.Mann. This is as much about the spectacle of gratuitous violence as it is about the execution of crime and punishment with each sequence seeped in almost esoteric beauty immersed in realistic technique which transports you into the hearts and minds of each character . marion Coutillard must be the greatest actress in cinema today as she sets a standard of acting which will be difficult to match yet both Depp as dillinger and Bale as the rather stolid introverted purvis are hypnotic to watch . This is a fecund facade of imagination and talent that you can view as many times as you wish with equal joy and emotional satiety which is a tribute to the thirties hollywood where Gable Powell and Myrna loy are paid homage by a great director yet in doing so with the spectacular Selznick monochrome images he redeems modern American cinema and brings time into a full circle as every grand slam in the universe enters a cycle to repeat their rendezvous with greatness . A modern masterpiece with motion that weaves magical spells with eloquent frames that cannot be praised enough for either their expressive potential or their potent emotion .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2009MichaelFeaturedI went to see this film today with great expectations would it be another Titanic or Pearl Harbour style film with loads of depth and would it pull me in?? Sadly No it wasnt a bad film but it didnt involve the viewer and overall it felt like it dragged and it doesnt have very much action at all The characters are well thought out and depp is excellent but the storyline should have been more interesting. I rate this film 2 out of 5. I feel the ending isnt very good a Romanian girl who was close to johnny would rather have a slight chance of not being deported than letting johnny die.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2009movie newbieFeaturedwhat the review says is very true. its almost a 30s movie.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 2 2009 Save for later Saved Johnny Depp stars as legendary Depression-era outlaw John Dillinger in a scene from ""Public Enemies."" Peter Mountain/ Universal Pictures/ AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Hollywood has made so many 1930s-era gangster movies that the only excuse for a new one is novelty. Why else endure yet again all those rat-a-tat shootouts? Nostalgia has its limits.Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" starring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger doesnt attempt to break new ground. It tills the old ground albeit with new-style star power and Manns signature cinematic flourishes. But Depp is unduly subdued and Manns cape work is oversold.Despite the famous bank robbers notoriety only two ""Dillinger"" movies one made in 1945 starring Lawrence Tierney the other from 1973 with Warren Oates have prominently featured him - and neither were wonderful. The hope was that Mann known for squeezing every last drop of India ink out of his crime-world noirs (""Manhunter"" ""Heat"" ""Collateral"") would find a fresh way to either remythologize Dillinger or debunk his legend. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Hes fallen hard for the mythology skimping just about everything else that might bring Dillinger to life. Youd be hard-pressed to tell from this film notwithstanding the occasional prettified hobo that the country was mired in the Great Depression. Mann and coscreenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman have limned - i.e. watered down - the Dillinger material from Bryan Burroughs 2004 nonfiction book ""Public Enemies Americas Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI 1933-34."" Their real touchstone is old Hollywood crime films. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Public Enemies Manns hero-worshipy treatment of Dillinger is undercut by the films dreamtime existentialist aura. In reality the working poor cheered Dillingers bank raids but in ""Public Enemies"" the Depression is just a prop and so Dillingers populist hero status what little we see of it makes scant sense. (This is probably why we see so little of it.) Missing as a result is the knockabout tumult of a time when gangsters could ascend to the same stardom as the movie actors who played gangsters. Dillinger was for a while every bit as big as Jimmy Cagney. Mann pirouettes around the twin realities of the Depression and the star culture it engendered and offers instead a moody blues doominess. Its a vacuum filling a vacuum.The people who made this movie are too smart not to realize theyre trafficking in cliches. But theyve outsmarted themselves. When for example Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) Chicago hatcheck girl-turned-Dillinger dearie says to him ""I dont want to be around when youre dead"" were meant to regard the line as so hackneyed its iconic. But a burnished cliche is still a cliche.I wasnt surprised by this movies arrant romantic streak - Mann has always been big on glorioso gangsterism. He gets all elegiac about how organized crime pushed out independent operators like Dillinger as if we were talking about mom and pop stores and not vicious killers. But I was amazed at how in propping up Dillinger as the Peoples Choice he simplistically stacks the deck. The newly invented FBI as personified by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) and Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) comes across as a repository of monomaniacal psychos. (In the films most egregious moment Mann deliberately invokes Abu Ghraib in a sequence where a rogue lawman tortures Billie.) Was Mann afraid that Dillingers vaunted folk mythology wouldnt hold up to scrutiny unless his adversaries were wackos?Virtually all crime movies engage in mythmaking including many of the best such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde."" But Francis Ford Coppolas classic was ultimately about the corruption of the American dream and it had a novelistic richness. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" gave us an entirely new and startling take on violence.""Public Enemies"" for all its ambition is basically about dark shadows and photogenic faces. Its about the iconography of Johnny Depps fine-drawn features. But utilizing Depp a great and charismatic actor as a species of decor is a waste.This being a Michael Mann movie there are some virtuoso set pieces especially the extended nighttime FBI raid on Dillinger at Wisconsins remote Little Bohemia lodge and there are choice supporting players - Stephen Langs Texas cop being a standout. He brings some hard-worn grit to the proceedings.""Public Enemies"" could have used a lot more grit. Without it were left with a crime movie fantasia that slips all too easily into the ether. Grade B- (Rated R for gangster violence and some language.)

Universal Pictures Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" never lacks for interest or interesting info. Back in the 1930s we learn the FBI was simply called the Bureau of Investigation before being formally Federalized. Mr. Mann uses the movie to conduct his own investigation of an era when J. Edgar Hoover and his agents were locked in self-promotional combat with self-mythologizing criminals. This gangster drama starring Johnny Depp as Public Enemy Number One the bank robber John Dillinger and Christian Bale as Dillingers G-Man nemesis Melvin Purvis is marvelously detailed and meticulously crafted an elegant evocation of Depression-era America and its fascination with crime. What the movie lacks is any sense of elation--its joyless by choice--although moments of passion burst through the prevailing gloom like muzzle flashes in the night. Mr. Depps performance sets the tone. Dont look for Johnny Depp the entertainer. The sly eccentric who gave ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" its whimsical soul is nowhere to be found. This time the actor gives himself heart and head to a portrayal of a tightly disciplined not-so-bad guy who speaks in terse zingers (""Whats on your mind?"" his lawyer asks. ""The electric chair"" Dillinger replies) who comes to enjoy the publics adulation and struggles to reconcile the risks he runs for money plus a generous measure of fame with the love he feels for his beautiful girlfriend Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard). Its an impressive performance rather than an exciting one and for a while Mr. Bales work is of a piece--his Purvis seems to be Dillinger seen darkly in a mirror. All too often though the G-Man sounds and even looks like the Dark Knight voice stuck in breathy mutterings eyes burning beneath a fedora carapace. DVD Focus Miami Vice (2006) ENLARGE A more unsavory collection of drug lords underlings and dead-souled thugs has seldom been assembled. Still Michael Manns feature-film update of his 1980s TV series turns out to be terrifically entertaining even if the plot is borderline-incomprehensible. Unexpectedly for this macho subject matter theres a gorgeously romantic interlude. It begins when Gong Lis Isabella a financial wizard working with a globalized drug cartel takes Colin Farrells cop Sonny skipping over the waves in a speedboat from Miami to Havana for mojitos. The idyll ends on a Cuban beach with something approaching mutual love. Alexander Nevsky (1938) ENLARGE The battle on the ice in Sergei Eisensteins first sound film--rigidly disciplined Teutonic knights against Prince Alexander Nevskys courageous Russian troops on frozen Lake Pelpis in the 13th century--is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of cinema. It is also one of the only compelling arguments in favor of watching Eisensteins plodding nationalist epic; another is Sergei Prokofievs brilliant score. The prince is played by the great Nikolai Cherkasov who later played the title roles in both parts of Eisensteins ""Ivan the Terrible."" If you decide to search out ""Alexander Nevsky"" look for the Criterion DVD; any other disk or tape betrays the films visual and musical grandeur. My Bodyguard (1980) ENLARGE Tony Bill directed this beguiling--and undeservedly neglected--coming-of-age comedy about a couple of outcasts who become friends. Matt Dillon in one of his first feature roles leads a gang that makes life miserable for Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace) a vulnerable kid who has just transferred from private to public school in Chicago. In desperation Clifford seeks protection from an older kid Linderman (Adam Baldwin) who by legend if not by fact killed and maybe dined on his own brother. The film written by Alan Ormsby addresses the issue of schoolyard bullies without dwelling on it. -- Joe Morgenstern The one consistent source of surprise and delight is Ms. Cotillard who won an Oscar last year for her performance as Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose."" Watch closely what she does and you still wont know how she does it--her scenes are the dramatic equivalent of Ricky Jays card tricks. Its abundantly clear though that an actress of singular skill has created a complex character--smart forthright fearless and yet touchingly tender--out of relatively little screen time. Billie Frechette tells Dillinger that shes half American Indian; this has allowed Ms. Cotillard to transpose any trace of her own French accent into enchanting new keys. Yet I could almost hear echoes of Piaf singing ""Mon homme"" in Billies poignant exclamation to a Chicago cop whos been roughing her up ""When my Johnny finds out how you slapped around his girl you know whats going to happen to you fat boy."" John Dillinger was a purposeful criminal and Michael Mann is a purposeful director. Thats not to equate the career categories only to say that Mr. Mann makes movies with distinctive looks (often dark) and distinctive perspectives (often distant). Several set pieces serve as reminders if any are needed of his virtuosity a trackdown in an apple orchard; a precision-planned jailbreak; a playful interlude involving J. Edgar Hoover in a newsreel. Best of all he does a bravura dramatization of the FBIs botched attempt to capture Dillinger and his gang at a rustic lodge in northern Wisconsin. (The script was adapted by the director Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman from the book by Bryan Burrough.) To find tonal variety in the moral and visual darkness of ""Public Enemies"" Mr. Mann and his masterful cinematographer Dante Spinotti chose high-definition digital equipment which shines in low-light situations instead of using film which needs more light but yields greater nuance. The results can be sumptuous as well as shadowy; an overhead shot in blacks and browns of the Dillinger gang entering a bank; a nighttime media circus 1930s version lit by news photographers flares; a remarkable re-creation of the FBIs ambush outside Chicagos Biograph theater where Dillinger went to see a Clark Gable gangster film called ""Manhattan Melodrama."" The scene inside the theater is fascinating too; Dillinger connects intensely with Gables Blackie Gallagher whose personality is as exuberant as Dillingers is muted. Yet our connections with ""Public Enemies"" remain abstract. The darkness and the distance kill the fun. Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs If you think it was tough being a mammoth in the Ice Age imagine how it was for two mammoths forced to carry the lions share of the plot in the first two ""Ice Age"" films. Fortunately for them if not for the cause of enlightenment ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" conflates the planets history by 65 million years so that Manny and Ellie who are about to become parents can share the screen however warily with a couple of T-rexes and other denizens of the Cretaceous period. The producers decision makes commercial sense. Theres only so much drama to be found in Ice Age creatures and only so much visual variety to be found in ice. But the strategy like the series latest edition soon melts down. ""Ice Age"" continues to depend heavily and I mean heavily on those trudging mammoths and on a couple of squirrels--the previously adorable Scrat having been given a girlfriend--who work their acorn routine to death. ENLARGE Two of the ""Ice Age"" critters. Twentieth Century Fox The movie is pleasant enough for kids and will surely play to large numbers of them during the summer If 80% of success is showing up the main component of box-office success is filling a need. Theres even a character brightly voiced by Simon Pegg who was inspired by the Johnny Depp of ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" But theres also a sense of ineptness in a script that constantly reaches with only modest success for amusing things that the mammoths and their friends can do. I should add that I saw the film in an unimpressive 3-D version; the process did little to relieve the storys flatness. ENLARGE Louise Bourgoin and Fabrice Luchini in ""The Girl From Monaco."" Magnolia Pictures The Girl From Monaco Five years ago in a review of Patrice Lecontes ""Intimate Strangers"" I wrote that Fabrice Luchini gave one of the best performances of that year in one of the years best films. He played an unmarried middle-aged accountant buttoned up in business suits who seemed at first to be a failed romantic. He has a similar role that of a brilliant but neurotic lawyer Bertrand in Anne Fontaines ""The Girl From Monaco."" This time though hes thwarted by an unwieldy plot a triangle comprised of Bertrand his bodyguard and a charming libertine who works as a TV weather girl. Whats more the girl of the title isnt charming at all--the actress who plays her strains to be so without the means to do so--and the film having paraded itself fairly clumsily as a romantic comedy with psychological twists turns absurdly serious on the treacherous roads that hug Monacos cliffs.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Ass Man Guerrilla comic Sacha Baron Cohen takes riotous aim at homophobia. Plus the even more subversive Humpday. By David Edelstein Published Jul 2 2009 ShareThis (Photo Frank Ockenfels/Courtesy of Universal) If the latest Sacha Baron Cohen provocation Bruno seems less sadistic than Borat its because wagging ones gay butt in the face of potentially violent homophobes is not just aggressive its borderline suicidal. I mean Bruno puts the moves on hunters with guns. In The Hurt Locker journalist Chris Hedges is quoted saying war can be a drug a potent and often lethal addictionand Baron Cohen is a genuine comic guerrilla charging right to the front lines of the war against prejudice and sanctimony. Whats open to debate is whether hes also a comic gorillaa cheap-shot artist a mauler. See Also  Brunos Greatest Fashion Hits  Why He Makes Us Proud of America  The Jokes He Told in Every Interview  Are We Laughing With Him or at Him? Is Bruno riotous? Yes more so than Borat in which Baron Cohens targets were ducks in a barrel and largely undeserving of ridicule. He doesnt aim much higher here but his tricks are more inventive and his buttsso to speakmore defended. The movie centers on a doomed quest After being schwarz-listed in the European fashion industry the flaming childishly oblivious Austrian exhibitionist flies to Hollywood determined to become a movie star. The people he appalls with his idiocy and well gayness are ostensibly not in on the jokealthough you cant always be sure. To get the most out of Bruno you have to suspend disbelief and regard the movie as a hard-R-rated Candid Camera to accept that pace Eminem the celebrities and ordinary folk Baron Cohen punks are being driven to actual sputtering rages. Are we made to feel superior to said butts? But(t) of course And some of them have it coming. I loved watching (through my fingers) as Bruno tried to manipulate right-wing moralist Ron Paul into taking it up the Hershey Highway for a gay sex tape. Nearly as excruciating are his earnestly arse-centric queries to a former homosexual who came to Christ and now deprograms other godless queers. If the focus-group audience stunned by Brunos naked gyrations on a talk-show pilot are relatively innocent well so are folks on Candid Camera. The good people in the audience of The Richard Bey Show have every reason to writhe as Bruno trots out his adopted African baby O.J. in a T-shirt reading GAYBYbut the prank is still a howl. A detour to the Middle East is off-topic but what Jackass daredevil ever had the chutzpah to stride through an Israeli Orthodox neighborhood in a black hat payos and short shorts? Blandly remarking to a seething Islamist leader outside a Lebanese refugee camp that his King Osama looks like a dirty wizard Baron Cohen even courts Jewish martyrdom. Underlying all these gagsthe funny the crude the funny and crudeis a hard truth Flagrant gay behavior drives a lot of heteros insane. To be honest Im uncomfortable watching two guys with tongues down each others throats too but at least I know the problem is mine not theirs. When the hushed arty Brokeback Mountain came out its couplings set against purple mountains majesty many right-wing commentators announced that they couldnt bear to watch such abominations. To themand to those wholl see Bruno because its the latest gross-out comedy sensationBaron Cohen is proclaiming Suck on this Lynn Sheltons marvelous chamber comedy Humpday butts up against the same sort of taboos as Bruno and in its fumbling semi-improvised way its equally hilarious and even more subversive. Its a dramatic neutron bomb exploding inner lives while leaving social structures intact. Seattle city planner Ben (Mark Duplass) is living peacefully somewhat snoozily with his wife Anna (Alycia Delmore) when his wanderlust-ing college buddy Andrew (Joshua Leonard) shows up at his doora threat to his domesticity but not in ways immediately apparent. When the next day Ben goes to pick up Andrew from a bohemian bisexual enclave he stumbled into (a sign on the door reads DIONYSUS) he ends up stoned and with a sexual-revolutionary idea For a local amateur-porn fest hell make a video with two straight guys boningi.e. him and Andrew. The tension in Humpday is whether these old pals will in the sober light of day go through with their art projectand how theyll justify it to Anna whos having a hard enough time getting Ben to bone her even when theyre readying a nursery. Shelton (a dishy lesbian in the Dionysus scene) depicts the sexual twilight zone of male buddydom with satire and sympathy. Humpday is a bigger threat to homophobes than Bruno because there arent any flamers on display. Gay straight biits all shades of gray. Maybe Ben and Andrews manly wrasslin has no sexual component. Maybe it has a lotor a little. Shelton gives every epithet a devilish spin from the freely tossed f-word to the mens sad realization that theyre pussies. Id say this movie made me giggle all the way throughbut that would make my laughter sound girlie. Which it might have been. Or not. I dont know and neither will you. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard star in Public Enemies. Joe Neumaier Thursday July 2 2009 825 AM Title Public Enemies Movies about Depression-era gangsters often resemble boys playing with toy guns You see the spark of This is cool but you dont sense a purpose. The underconceived ""Public Enemies"" suffers from that lack of drive though Johnny Depp is so compelling and charismatic as John Dillinger he provides enough firepower to make the film legit.""Enemies"" has a refreshingly mature sensibility and the connection it makes between between Dillinger and celebrity is legitimate if only tepidly explored. But director Michael Mann working from a book by Bryan Burrough is a filmmaker whose lyricism needs to be tethered to more than just theme. When it is he clicks (""Collateral"" ""The Insider"" ""The Last of the Mohicans""). When it isnt (""Miami Vice"" ""Ali"" ""Heat"") he shoots blanks.Dillinger -- fresh from a 1933 prison break in his home state of Indiana -- lives large off the bank loot he steals in the Chicago region. His exploits and nightclub lifestyle rile J. Edgar Hoover (played by a cartoonish Billy Crudup) who puts steely G-man Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) in charge of the Bureau of Investigations Dillinger task force.Between jail breaks and robberies Dillinger romances hat-check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard). As Purvis brings in reinforcements and closes in the gangster is a tough guy right through to his spectacularly conspicuous end outside the Biograph Theater.Like earlier big-screen versions of this story ""Enemies"" purports to dissect its subjects meaning to Americans of the early 30s. But one gorgeously shot tableau of flashbulbs and fame -- and Dillingers famous jailhouse ""press conference"" in which he takes questions while draping an arm around law officers -- has to suffice. This isnt ""Bonnie and Clyde""; psychoanalyzing Dillinger and his times doesnt interest Mann. The gunfights especially a great grandstanding one in Wisconsin take center stage.Yet whenever Depp isnt onscreen the movie drifts. Bales blank-eyed turn doesnt register thus robbing the story of the back-and-forth it needs. And Cotillard (an Oscar winner for ""La Vie en Rose"") is simply a moll forced to utter banal lines like ""Theyre either going to catch or kill you and I dont want to be around for that.""Which leaves Depp holding the bag. Luckily its another effortless move for a guy who can do no wrong. What other performer of his generation could be so iconic between weirdo turns as Sweeney Todd Willy Wonka and the Mad Hatter and pull it off? Audiences connect with this actor the way ""Enemies"" implies Dillinger and the public did. Only because its Depp do we care whether he lives or dies.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""Public Enemies"" two threats to law and order loom over Depression-era America. One is John Dillinger a gallant bank robber and his gang. The other is a new national police force being assembled by an ambitious administrator named J. Edgar Hoover. Michael Manns new film is a white-hot crime drama but just beneath its bullet-pocked surface are substantial insights about the limits of law enforcement the point at which societys guardians do more damage than its thieves. It fits neatly on the shelf with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Godfather."" The film covers the hectic final year of Dillingers life beginning in 1933. It was not a time when citizens held bankers in high esteem. ""Some will rob you with a six-gun and some with a fountain pen"" goes a line in one of Woody Guthries Dust Bowl ballads. Dillinger an Indiana farm boy who let bank customers keep their own money during his raids and never killed anyone was considered a folk hero making war on the banks. With his trademark move vaulting over a bank counter with one hand while brandishing a Thompson machine gun he seemed to incarnate swashbuckling bravado. Although he was declared Public Enemy No. 1 many people cheered him on harboring his gang in their homes. ""Mister take me with you"" a bedraggled farm woman says when Dillinger takes his leave. Since he is played by a very dapper Johnny Depp its easy to understand her impulse. His basic pickup line is ""I like baseball movies good clothes fast cars and you. What else you need to know?"" A bold leader and strategist Dillinger made a mockery of Hoovers promised ""war on crime."" Hoover played with prissy malice by Billy Crudup appoints a special task force to take down the outlaw. He places Special Agent Melvin Purvis in charge with orders to bring Dillinger in by any means necessary. ""As they say in Italy these days Take off the white gloves "" Hoover snarls with a nod to Mussolini. PUBLIC ENEMIES  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong violence some sex scenes drug use and language. Christian Bale plays Purvis as a straight arrow twisted beyond all recognition in his battle against the elusive Dillinger gang. He hopes to use sophisticated scientific crime-fighting techniques tracking down the robbers by the label in Dillingers abandoned overcoat. He has no qualms over wiretapping and pressuring the criminals families and associates. But hes sickened to find his men trying to beat information out of suspects and to participate in fumbled ambushes that leave civilian bystanders riddled with lead. Although Depps Dillinger works out his bank raids in detail hes wild and impulsive in daily life. He has no overall plan. Stage a heist spend the money on nightclubs fast cars and women drive across the country get caught break out of jail steal the sheriffs car and repeat. He says he just wants to make one more big score and ""slide off the edge of the map."" He knows better. The law was closing in on him from one side. Organized crime was squeezing him on the other. A substantial subplot focuses on his exile from the increasingly sophisticated Cosa Nostra whose bookie operations were becoming far more profitable than Dillingers risky robberies. By the end of his 13-month spree Dillinger met and lost the love of his life Billie Frechette (fetchingly played by Marion Cotillard) and saw most of his gang killed. Depps Dillinger is too shrewd to think hed evade Hoovers G-Men forever. In one nerve-tingling scene he strolls into the Chicago Police Departments Dillinger Investigation bureau examines mounted photos of his lost comrades (and Billie) and asks the cops listening to a ball game ""Whats the score?"" But he already knows the score. When he settles in at the Art Deco Biograph Theatre to watch ""Manhattan Melodrama"" his eyes gleam with identification as Clark Gable goes to the electric chair. The acting is top drawer from the stars to the little roles. British actor Stephen Graham makes such an antic psychopath of Baby Face Nelson that you wish hed survive to the end of the film (though that would deny us his jaw-dropping death scene). Channing Tatum makes a handsome Pretty Boy Floyd and Giovanni Ribisi Leelee Sobieski Lili Taylor and singer Diana Krall pop in for brief but effective appearances. With its soundtrack of suave standards and growling guitar blues the film sounds as good as it looks. Mann shot the film in high-definition video giving it a richly textured look distinct from most period films which favor celluloid for a glossy romantic effect. Mann makes a more imaginative choice plunging us into the thick of the action. There are two hellacious firefights that will knock your socks off and straight into the hamper. ""Public Enemies"" proves that excitement and intelligence arent mutually exclusive values but the yin and yang of blockbuster entertainment.

"Public Enemies | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; public-enemies ) Public Enemies (United States 2009) June 30 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres something almost old-fashioned about Michael Manns Public Enemies a mostly factual re-telling of the descent and death of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) one of the 1930s most infamous bank robbers. More drama than thriller the movie does a slightly better job with period detail than with character building. While Dillinger is sympathetically portrayed he falls just short of full three-dimensionality with the character never quite emerging from the shadow of the real-world legend. Dillingers pursuer Federal agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) fares worse hes a perfect stereotype of the grim humorless lawman bent on delivering justice to criminals by using the business end of a firearm. Thats not to say Public Enemies is by any means a bad film; on the contrary its quite engaging. It is competently constructed and often compelling but it will not be mentioned in the same breath as some of its classic predecessors. Obvious candidates for comparison are Arthur Penns 1967 touchstone Bonnie and Clyde and Brian De Palmas 1987 The Untouchables. Public Enemies lacks the fire and energy of the former and the operatic grandeur of the latter. Manns approach to this story is businesslike and low-key; hes not trying for something epic. His goal is to demythologize Dillinger - something at which he is only partially successful. Public Enemies Dillinger is not about crime and money. Instead he is driven by love and compulsion. The only thing more important to him than robbing banks is coat-check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard). Public Enemies which derives much of its factual information from Bryan Burroughs non-fiction book of the same name begins with Dillingers audacious jailbreak from a prison in Lima. At the time some of Dillingers best-known robberies are behind him and he is already one of Americas most celebrated gangsters. After his escape he and his gang head to ground in Chicago where the post-Capone mob offers him sanctuary and protection. During this period he becomes involved with Frechette who he views as the love of his life. Meanwhile Dillinger has become an obsession for FBI honcho J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) who appoints Purvis as the head of the Chicago office with the primary directive of tracking down Dillinger. Purvis initial efforts are bloody and ineffective but he learns from his mistakes and soon brings on board a group of hardened Texas Rangers like Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang) to turn the tide. Dillinger is again caught and imprisoned this time in Crown Pointe at a jail so tightly guarded it is deemed to be escape-proof. Dillinger has little trouble freeing himself departing the grounds in the stolen car of the towns sheriff. Upon his return to Chicago however he discovers that the climate had changed. The syndicate now run under the auspices of boss Frank Nitti perceives bank robbers like Dillinger as loose cannons who are bad for business. The gangsters no longer offer aid or shelter to Dillinger; in fact they conspire against him. He again hooks up with Frechette but their reunion has an unhappy conclusion. Circumstances force him to join forces with the likes of Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) but a gradual narrowing of his options leads to his eventual demise after being betrayed by ""The Lady in Red"" at the Biograph Theater on July 21 1934. Mann injects a little too much of himself into the films style. In particular most of the movie is shot using hand-held cameras and while this works well to enhance the sense of chaos and confusion during certain scenes its overuse becomes distracting and at times off-putting. Directors often forget that frequent swish-pans and the lack of a stable plane can result in nausea for a certain portion of the movie-going public and there are likely to be some queasy stomachs during the course of Public Enemies. Camera movement issues aside the film is beautifully mounted with many scenes being shot in the actual locations where events occurred some 75 years ago. The directors objective is to emphasize drama over suspense and as a result the kind of fast pace and narrative momentum often associated with a thriller is absent here. However there are individual scenes in which Mann ratchets up the level of tension. The most apparent of these is a seemingly throw-away sequence after escaping from the Crown Pointe jail Dillinger and his pals sit at a red traffic light in the stolen car in plain view of everyone in town including law enforcement officials. It seems that the light will never turn green; endless seconds tick by. Passersby turn to look at the car. The scene intentionally drawn-out for maximum effect is as agonizing as De Palmas famous homage to The Battleship Potemkins Odessa Steps in The Untouchables. Another standout sequence in Public Enemies is more effective for comedy than suspense and involves Dillingers reaction in a movie theater to an on-screen announcement warning the audience to be on the lookout for him Americas ""Public Enemy 1."" Perhaps with the idea of replicating the kind of classic confrontation between Law and Criminality depicted in Heat Mann cast strong actors as Dillinger and Purvis. Although both Depp and Bale bring forceful personalities to their role only the former is given the opportunity to sear the screen. Bales character is too thinly-drawn for him to be able to do much beyond glowering and looking serious. Depps ferocious intensity reminds us that he is capable of riveting the attention even when not playing the kind of odd off-kilter roles that have become his specialty over the years. The spotlight is often stolen (even from Depp) by Marion Cotillard whose interpretation of Frechette is so beguiling that its easy to understand why someone as hard-bitten as Dillinger might be attracted to her. And Billy Crudups supporting performance as J. Edgar Hoover is brilliant. Burrough the author of the source material has admitted that although the movie takes a certain amount of artistic license with history it is the most factual telling of Dillingers story thus far to appear on screen. Mann does not overglamorize the bank robbing lifestyle although he shows the gap between how Dillinger is viewed by law enforcement officials (as a dangerous man who needs to be stopped at all costs) and by the general public (as a Robin Hood-like figure). Public Enemies also touches none-too-subtly on a topic of some contemporary concern what constitutes an ""unacceptable practice"" in extreme interrogations. This is raised twice during the course of the film most notably when Frechette is battered and beaten in an attempt to force Dillingers location from her. Finally there is a nod to Americas fascination with the lurid. After Dillinger is shot dead a massive crowd gathers to view the spectacle. Although Public Enemies does not ascend to the heights of Bonnie and Clyde or The Untouchables it is nevertheless an effective depiction of the final months of the life of one of the United States most infamous criminals. Of all the cinematic versions of Dillingers life and/or death this is the most dramatically compelling. Its an imperfect motion picture but Depp and Cotillard are compulsively watchable and theres enough intrigue and historical veracity to make the 140 minutes pass quickly. If you can overcome issues associated with the hand-held camerawork Public Enemies is solid in both its storytelling and the way in which the narrative is represented on screen.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Public Enemies Drama. Starring Johnny Depp Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Michael Mann. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If ""Public Enemies"" lacks anything its something audiences cant legitimately expect to find a certain extra something. ""Public Enemies"" has everything else. Director Michael Mann has taken the story of John Dillinger the notorious bank robber and Depression-era folk hero and has made from it a drama full of dread and atmosphere a 140-minute film that in no way seems long thats a succession of compelling scenes with no dead wood. He has also rescued Johnny Depp from cliche. This time Depp doesnt play his own legend or even Dillingers. Instead he digs past the surface to find the wellspring of Dillingers anger and criminal genius. The only thing ""Public Enemies"" lacks is the sense of a story bigger than itself. Mann takes on a great American subject but with no desire to make a great American statement. A movie about the Great Depression for example could have had some special resonance during a bad recession but the issues Mann explores here are personal to the characters. You remember how ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was about Bonnie and Clyde but also seemed in a haunted way about America in the 1960s and about the collision between youth and age and freedom versus conformity? ""Public Enemies"" is a movie about Dillinger that days later is still a movie about Dillinger. Photo Peter Mountain Universal Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Christian Bale in ""Public Enemies."" Christian Bale in ""Public Enemies."" Photo Peter Mountain Universal Movie review Depp is dead-on as Dillinger 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Accept that and youll be in a better place to appreciate Depps best performance in years perhaps in his career. That Depp is onto something special is apparent from the movies first minutes as we see Dillinger breaking out of prison on his first day under lockup. Depp gives us a Dillinger of many shadings whose special talent is his uncanny understanding of human nature. This understanding makes him both impossible to incarcerate and a master of public relations. It also makes him irresistible to women - though looking like Johnny Depp doesnt hurt either. Beyond that Depp suggests that theres a part of Dillinger that Dillinger himself can never know - some deep place of longing that propels (but can never be fulfilled by) his criminal existence. Depp conveys this wordlessly taking what might simply have been a good performance and raising it to an exalted level. Its 1932 a time of bank failures and mortgage foreclosures. To a nation in panic a fellow who goes around robbing banks seems more enterprising than criminal and so Dillinger the most wanted man in America is able to hide among the people. But Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) head of the FBIs Chicago office is closing in on Americas public enemies. And J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) needs to resolve the Dillinger case in order to cement his status in Washington. ""Public Enemies"" can be watched as the story of three neurotic men. Dillinger has a screw loose of course but then so does Purvis who as played by Bale is strangely bottled up and angry. And Hoover is the worst talking and moving like a robot a rigid and thoroughly inauthentic figure. What a shame it would be for a woman to get caught in that crossfire - and then one does Billie Frechette the hatcheck girl who becomes Dillingers girlfriend. Michael Mann is known as a tough guy director but ""Public Enemies"" is more along the order of Manns ""Last of the Mohicans"" with a male-female relationship at its emotional center. French actress Marion Cotillard (""La Vie en Rose"") in her first major role in an English-language feature loses nothing in the translation. She emerges as a powerhouse in the classic Hollywood tradition with looks like Olivia de Havillands and the attitude of Bette Davis. Pay close attention to the scene in which FBI interrogators beat up Billie. Cotillard ferocious and vulnerable has the complexity and transparency of a big star. ""Public Enemies"" deglamorizes Dillinger and his life as a public enemy. Though Dillinger is no villain like the off-his-rocker Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) hes no hero and his life looks like a miserable series of near escapes and disappointing scores. This ennui threatens to infect the audiences experience but then comes a genuinely great sequence in and around the Biograph Theater in Chicago. Most people who see ""Public Enemies"" will know exactly what happened there on July 22 1934. Other films have portrayed that day but Mann does something special with it He uses the movie Dillinger went to see that night ""Manhattan Melodrama"" as an integral part of the sequence. Dillinger watches the story of a noble crook who meets a bad end. And Depp watches Clark Gable. Meanwhile the law untouched by splendor or imagination waits outside. There are meanings here that transcend a prose description. Until that point ""Public Enemies"" has been merely competent - strenuously intelligently competent but earthbound all the same. But in the Biograph scene Mann achieves poetry. More poetry would have been nice. Audiences like Dillinger always want more. But ""Public Enemies"" better than about 90 percent of the movies that get released is enough to keep all but the most greedy of us satisfied. -- Advisory Strong language a sexual interlude and lots of graphic violence.

"Public Enemies reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Public Enemies reviewed. Public Enemies reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 30 2009 1040 PM Original Gangster Michael Mann films the life of John Dillinger in Public Enemies. By Dana Stevens Johnny Depp in Public Enemies The real-life story of the final days of John Dillinger may have been scripted by God for Michael Mann to direct. All the Mann elements are there an existential showdown between two larger-than-life manly men (Dillinger and Melvin Purvis the FBI agent who tracked him down after a prolonged manhunt); an opportunity for unpredictable bursts of stylized and bloody gunfighting; and the 30s setting which offers the fashion-loving Mann countless occasions to show off his steely-eyed heroes in long black coats and precisely tilted fedoras. This is the material Manns been waiting for his entire career. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. So why is Public Enemies(Universal Pictures) Manns version of the Dillinger story (based on the recent bio by Bryan Burrough) so oddly unengaging? Thats an honest question not a rhetorical one. As a Mann fan who finds catharsis even in his lesser films (his 2006 Miami Vice made no narrative sense but it left behind a glorious bundle of vague affects) I went in convinced that Public Enemies would be at the very least a rousing cops-and-robbers show and at the most a reinvention of the gangster movie. Instead its like spending an afternoon--a long one--at a beautifully lit wax-museum display inspired by earlier gangster movies. Advertisement A central problem though by no means the only one may be that Johnny Depp is miscast as the elusive bank robber. The hugely magnetic Depp rarely plays straight-up action roles (the closest hes come to date may be the undercover agent in Donnie Brasco) and for good reason. The two modes he specializes in are the romantic naif (Benny and Joon Finding Neverland) and the flamboyant grotesque (the Pirates of the Caribbean films Sweeney Todd). His uncharacteristically restrained performance here conveys Dillingers charisma (and in a few incongruous but touching scenes his bouts of fragile neediness) but never the mans pure menace. Obviously Dillinger didnt become an underworld legend (and outlast all the other big-name gangsters of his day) just by charming the ladies and sporting a mean fedora. He must have been a ruthless sonofabitch and although everyone around Depps Dillinger treats him as though that were true we never see that crazy glint in his eye--hes more Buster Keaton than James Cagney. Public Enemies social canvas is limited in scope--theres little attention paid for example to the Depression or Prohibition conditions that made possible the existence of superstar criminals like Dillinger. But Mann does provide a glimpse into the early days of the FBI which in the 30s was still being dreamed up by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup whos perfectly mastered the newsreel-ready cadences of prewar American speech). Every tiny role is cast with a recognizable actor Lili Taylor Giovanni Ribisi Channing Tatum and Stephen Dorff all show up to speak only a few lines apiece. The great character actor Peter Gerety as a mob lawyer who fulsomely defends Dillinger in court is a standout in the supporting cast. Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette the half-French half-Native American coat-check girl who becomes Dillingers girl is a cut above the usual gangsters moll (and like Depp she wears period costumes like a dream). And as always Michael Manns camera (this time as in his last two films its a high-definition digital one) does gorgeous daring and seemingly impossible things A nighttime shootout in the woods is somehow visible amid total blackness. The chrome trim on a getaway car reflects the scene being fled--and then the open sky. An image that occurs late in the films opening prison-break sequence and that is revisited many times later is a close-up of a mans face at the moment when in Dillingers words ""the life drains out of his eyes."" In the one big encounter between Purvis (Christian Bale) and Dillinger--although theyre respectively stalking and teasing one another throughout the movie Depp and Bale rarely share the frame--much is made of this trope as the two query each other warily through prison bars Have you seen the life drain out of a mans eyes? Yeah have you? But its not clear what Mann is going for by laying such stress on the soul-building (or just voyeuristic?) value of witnessing anothers death. When Dillinger himself is finally gunned down on his way out of a movie (spoiler alert I guess but has a gangsters ultra-cinematic death ever been so well-documented?) the pathos feels forced; its as if the viewer like John Dillinger has been the victim of a setup.

Which is not to say director Michael Manns gangster saga lacks flash and simmer. Johnny Depp gives a Golden-Age star turn as 1930s bank robber John Dillinger. And theres plenty of rat-a- tat-tat piercing Elliot Goldenthals brooding and restrained score. Director Mann has been a purveyor of movie cool for years. His best films (""The Insider"" ""Heat"") insist on just how deeply integral style is to a storys substance. A taut and tailored work ""Public Enemies"" is well-suited to a moment in which we ask questions about the power of institutions (a scene of interrogation will resonate uncomfortably if subtly) a time in which we are conflicted about the feedback loop between popular culture and celebrity. The movie captures an era when the Federal Bureau of Investigation was incorporating scientific data-driven methods into its mission. Scenes of agents hunched over recording devices headsets on attest to a push for a kind of codified crime busting. Billy Crudup and Christian Bale are FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and Chicago special agent Melvin Purvis. Hoover is a publicity hound and already shows signs of being vindictive. Bale depicts a tightly wound agent driven as much by muted desperation as ambition. Although based on Bryan Burroughs book ""Public Enemies Americas Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI 1933-34"" -- about the gangs led by Clyde Barrow Ma Barker and Pretty Boy Floyd -- this is a Dillinger flick. Because this is Depps film from start to finish. ""Public Enemies"" embraces its old-fashioned drama with gusto. It begins with an audacious prison break unfurling beneath a beautiful Indiana sky. Near its end the hero takes in a movie that stars silver-screen luminaries William Powell Clark Gable and Myrna Loy. It doesnt get much more glam than that. In between the movie embraces the romance of Dillinger and Billie Frechette. It focuses on the birth of organized crime-fighting. It hints smartly at the rise of organized crime and the demise of Dillingers more wild version. Depps portrayal is sensual and sentimental cocksure and courtly. The bank robbers courtship of the coat-check girl-- a mix of rush and care -- is a study in ""what women want."" Played by Marion Cotillard Billie may have an exotic French surname but she is shaped by her American Indian roots. Dillinger and Frechette have that peculiar American quality of belonging in the most rooted sense to this nations soul even as they are outsiders. If a female bank teller is won over by Dillingers courtly gestures Billies not as easily wowed. Although a bank manager is nearly as disarmed when his kidnapper sings Gene Autrys ""The Last Round Up."" Cotillard (who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Edith Piaf in ""La Vie en Rose"") captures Billies sense of whats really going on as well as her fear of how it all may end. Billie Holiday and Diana Krall songs underscore their achy vulnerable romance. After some bloody failures Purvis recognizes that bureaucratic methods wont get the job done. When he calls upon a group of Texas and Oklahoma lawmen the noose tightens. Among them is Charles Winstead played by Stephen Lang with cropped silver hair watery blue eyes. In the prologue to his book Burrough writes that he hoped to ""reclaim the War on Crime for the lawmen who fought it."" Throughout the movie the balance is tilted by the heft of Depps performance. Yet Lang asserts a counter version of American pragmatism -- and decency. Although muted it too has the feel of a star turn. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

But Madoff the man is as dull a figure as his crimes are vivid. Not so John Dillinger the brazen Depression-era bank robber. His fabled career busting into Midwestern banks and out of jails was brief -- he was 31 years old when he was shot to death by FBI agents led by steely G-man Melvin Purvis in Chicago in 1934. But during Dillingers reign the outlaw designated by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover as Public Enemy Number One played his part with aplomb happy to fill the bill as a tommy-gun-toting folk hero for a public who saw him as a defiant celebrity suitable for down-and-out times. As filmmaker Michael Mann takes pains to emphasize in his handsome underheated gangster drama Public Enemies the gent may have been murderous but he had style. In case theres any doubt the gangster-in-chief is played by Johnny Depp one of the most effortlessly elegant intriguingly self-contained American movie stars on screen today. But that mystery comes with a price. By the end of this arms-length study Depps Dillinger comes across as an interesting cat but never a knowable man -- hes a pop cultural phenomenon because the movie asserts he is not because we believe it. We dont feel the bank robbers heartbeat the way we felt the agonies of Russell Crowes whistle-blower at the end of The Insider -- ?or even grooved on the rhythms of cops Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs on Manns stylish Miami Vice. Dillinger the gun-waving daredevil is first seen finessing a prison break with his henchmen -- one of the directors famously crisp complex assertive males-in-extremis transactions. Shooting in HD Manns frequent collaborator cinematographer Dante Spinotti conveys the sense that the flat location landscape signifies both limitless opportunity -- and the impossibility of escape. Later the wanted man dines dances and romances his lady love Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard the French Oscar winner from La Vie en Rose working studiously in newly acquired English) when not busy taking the (banks) money and running. Throughout Depp talks softly making the most of those refined feminine features that once looked great in eyeliner as a pirate of the Caribbean and now look swell framed by hats. He projects seriousness -- and also telegraphs a hint of delight as if Dillinger is tickled by what hes getting away with hooked on the romance? of outlaw stardom. Mann meanwhile suggests that every character in this very masculine story is similarly beholden to individual obsessions; his upscale gangster pic is intent on making intellectual connections sacrificing depth of character in the process. Purvis played with a buttoned-down agents tight jaw by Christian Bale is obsessed with an efficient clean pursuit of justice and as he and his team hunt Dillinger and his accomplices the lawman is distressed to realize that purity of purpose isnt easy to maintain in the new modern? Federal Bureau of Investigation. In contrast FBI head J. Edgar Hoover played with terrific bursts of ornate egotistical menace by Billy Crudup is shown to be hooked on -- well on something slightly rotten and certainly ruthless something Purvis cant quite understand and eventually cant condone. With its measured team-produced screenplay by Mann Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman Public Enemies makes heavy business of the notion that Hoover ushered in? an era of ethically elastic law-enforcement procedures still recognizable today. Purvis is the existentially anxious 20th-century man caught in the middle of change he doesnt like. Dillinger represents the end of a desperate golden era when poor people cheered for robbers who gallantly called female hostages ""sister."" But as a murderess and a jailhouse matron sing in the musical Chicago -- another study of celebrity criminals -- ""What ever happened to class?"" Throughout his own? heinous career Bernard Madoff wore only gray suits. John Dillinger wouldnt have been caught dead in a costume so drab. Public Enemies re-creates clothes but doesnt fully fashion the man who wore them.

"Public Enemies Depp keeps the shadow on Dillinger | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsPublic Enemies Depp keeps the shadow on DillingerMichael Manns Public Enemies is so darkly gorgeous you want to spray whipped cream on it and eat it like chocolate cake.Johnny Depp stars as legendary Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger in Public Enemies.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. July 1 2009 Public Enemies (out of 4)Starring Johnny Depp Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Michael Mann. At major theatres. 14A Michael Manns Public Enemies is so darkly gorgeous you want to spray whipped cream on it and eat it like chocolate cake.Shadows overcoats and fedoras are jet black and shiny in Dante Spinottis vivid digital lensing. The effect renders faces and motivations more mysterious and accentuates the moral ambiguity of a Depression-era gangster story where you cheer the sharp outlaws and boo the dull coppers and greedy bankers.Where Mann and his leading man Johnny Depp go wrong is in extending this midnight aesthetic to Depps portrayal of John Dillinger the dapper thief who helped make the 1930s ""the golden age of bank robbery"" as a frontispiece tells us. Depp plays Dillinger almost as a ghost hinting at the mans charisma but never quiet nailing the flesh-and-blood figure who dominated newspaper headlines and enraptured hero-hungry Americans during his brief blazing reign in the early 1930s.We dont get to know how or why Dillinger became a master bank robber and risk-taker. The early going where he and his cohorts brazenly bust out of the Indiana State Penitentiary is so swift its almost impossible to recognize the players. Depp is in many respects a perfect fit for the dimpled Dillinger. Hes a movie star playing a movie star wannabe; the two could even share the same monogrammed cufflinks.Dillinger developed his signature one-handed bank counter leap after seeing it done in a film and his bloody final act - a rat-tat-tat highlight of Public Enemies - occurred outside Chicagos Biograph Theatre following a screening of the crime picture Manhattan Melodrama starring Clark Gable as a gangster. Mann and co-screenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman faithfully adapt the Dillinger portion of Bryan Burroughs absorbing 2004 book by the same name using the same locations where famous breakouts and shootouts occurred. Yet even while honouring history and the birth of the FBI that resulted from Americas first ""war on crime"" Mann is more inclined to coolly observe it than to make compelling drama out of it a puzzling move for the master hand behind the superior crime film Heat.Hes not terribly interested in the tales main adversarial contest whereby FBI agent Melvin Purvis played by Christian Bale with an abundance of clenched-teeth vigour hunts Dillinger at the behest of newly crowned bureau chief J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup never better). We first meet Purvis as hes shooting Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) with the icy dispatch of a dead-eyed hunter practising for bigger prey. His motivations are also obscure - is he driven by vendetta or simply following orders? - and were also given little indication of the high regard the public had for Dillinger the public enemy people regarded more as Robin Hood.A much better pairing is Depp with Marion Cotillard who as nightclub coat-check girl Billie Frechette the love of Dillingers brief life gives smouldering assent to crazy romance both between the sheets and on the streets.Two other performances stand out Giovanni Ribisi as trusted Dillinger associate Alvin (Creepy) Karpis the Montreal-born brainiac who also backed the Barker Gang; and Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead the laconic Texas Ranger conscripted by Purvis to join the Dillinger manhunt.Public Enemies is alert to the irony of gangsters aping movie stars and vice-versa but the films most telling moment occurs when Dillinger vanishes in plain sight.He sits smirking in yet another movie theatre as a public service newsreel comes on showing a wall-sized portrait of Dillinger and advising moviegoers to look to their left and right in case Public Enemy No. 1 is amongst them.Incredibly nobody notices Dillinger. Hes a phantom just as he remains in Depps flawed portrayal of him in Public Enemies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIEPublic Enemies   out of four Stars Johnny Depp Marion Cotillard Christian Bale Billy CrudupDirector Michael MannDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for gangster violence and some languageRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesOpens today nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Public Enemies is a welcome adult alternative to summers sophomoric blockbusters. The only transforming going on here is actors skillfully taking on roles of 30s-era gangsters and lawmen. Director Michael Mann (The Insider) mounts a technically proficient visually enthralling crime drama anchored by the low-key but captivating performance of Johnny Depp as legendary bank robber John Dillinger. Christian Bale is one-note as Melvin Purvis the lead FBI agent on the case. His efforts to nab Dillinger are juxtaposed against the fugitives cocky bravura in outwitting teams of law enforcement. Dillinger seems impervious to capture cleverly escaping when outgunned and surrounded dodging flurries of bullets and brazenly taunting the authorities by hiding in plain sight. A memorable scene features an almost impish Dillinger sitting in a crowded theater while a newsreel projects his larger-than-life image on the big screen. Some might be put off by the high-definition photography and handheld-camera shots but it suits the story which is anchored in historical accuracy. The production design costumes and evocative score add to the films sense of authenticity. The tale is no biopic. Mann avoids armchair psychology forgoing childhood flashbacks and focusing tightly on a distinct period in Dillingers life. Shortly after the film introduces Dillinger he falls in love with Billie Frechette a beautiful hat-check girl played by Marion Cotillard. Depp and Cotillard have palpable chemistry; their romantic scenes are some of the movies finest. Depp plays the glamorous Dillinger with a subtly simmering charm while avoiding theatricality. Mann photographs him in tight close-ups which heighten his appeal. But Dillinger remains enigmatic. Billy Crudup as the histrionic FBI head J. Edgar Hoover is perfectly pitched. Regarded as a latter-day Robin Hood Dillinger was a folk hero to the masses. He often insisted he robbed banks but not the common man. In addition to being timely in its depiction of banks as symbols of villainy Manns story is a commentary about the ineptitude of law enforcement. An action film that feels like an epic Public Enemies is an exciting and stylish slice of Americana. Though the film may leave viewers wanting to know more about the iconic gangster it is clearly intended to be a slice -- the most exciting portion -- of the Indiana-born bank robbers life.

Video by Universal Pictures>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Zak Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 1 2009 Its tough to watch Johnny Depp these days when hes not wearing eyeliner a do-rag and a monkey on his shoulder. After gooping up ""Finding Neverland"" glowering vacantly through ""Sweeney Todd"" and annihilating every sprinkle of dignity in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" how can he be trusted with another larger-than-life character defined by a complicated past? This StorySo Much Firepower So Little Heat in Soulless EnemiesPublic EnemiesFind Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Depp dials down his weirdness to play gangster John Dillinger and ironically this choice sinks the movie. ""Public Enemies"" despite packing thunderous rounds of ammunition is a touch too remote. There are no big speeches no drawn-out death scenes no gauzy flashbacks. Its a straight-faced no-nonsense shoot-em-up jailbreak cat-and-mouse kind of movie. Its also a double-barreled bummer. Theres no excitement in the bank-robbing no thrill of the chase no emotion over justice served or thwarted. Depps Dillinger is neither charming nor despicable nor does he occupy that delicious gray area between the two. His spree unspools dispassionately cold as a Colt .380. Forget feelings for a second. ""Public Enemies"" looks great. It has that pristine Michael Mann sheen. Colors are crisp. Every shot has a twilighty varnish. Dapper men in dark suits wage war in the marbled halls of capitalism. They lope like wolves into banks snatch fistfuls of money and retire to honey-hued cabarets to spend their loot living large in the face of the Great Depression. Under the stewardship of a prideful J. Edgar Hoover (played by an awkward Billy Crudup who seems to act mostly with jowls he doesnt have) the FBI strikes back at Dillinger and his peers first impotently then savagely. Leading the manhunt is a rigid stone-faced agent named Melvin Purvis played by Christian Bale with an introversion even more pathological than Bruce Waynes. The movie is a tussle of dark suits and fedoras with packs of trigger-happy men perforating the dickens out of the Midwest under a Hoover-mandated ""national war on crime."" Director Mann and cinematographer Dante Spinotti keep the camera at the shoulders of the actors holding the action in tight close-ups rarely stepping back for a wider look. ""Public Enemies"" feels narrow not panoramic. It lacks the mustiness of a period piece. Its definitely not a history lesson in disguise. Stylistically this is a refreshing approach. The last thing we need is another cookie-cutter biopic and Dillingers back story (tough childhood etc.) is concisely consigned to one line of dialogue. The problem is casting. Depp and Bale each capable of intense brooding blow each others circuits. Theres no electricity to the rivalry because its impossible to get a read on either man. Manns previous movies about boys and their guns were all very cool but still warm to the touch. ""Heat"" despite its machismo was opera. ""Collateral"" crackled along on the dynamic between its lead actors. The 2006 ""Miami Vice"" despite what the haters say was charged with an electric moodiness. Compared with them ""Public Enemies"" is practically soulless. Its procedural. Its also an aural spanking. The headache peaks about three-quarters of the way through as the rat-a-tatting starts to bury any whisper of story. The movies faint pulse comes from French actress Marion Cotillard (""La Vie en Rose"") who plays Dillingers girlfriend Billie Frechette a coat-check girl whose life changes forever when she agrees to an impromptu date. Cotillard has a particularly affecting scene in which she is brutally interrogated by overzealous agents. Its here that ""Public Enemies"" gets closest to a theme that resounds in the heart and the head. As seen through Billies working-class eyes the great crime wave of the early 30s was less about a grand game of cat vs. mouse than about the collateral incurred during such a game. The high-octane misadventures of Dillinger and his peers captured the attention of a doldrummy nation but they also shattered the lives of innocent bystanders who were pulled into complicity and punished for it gunned down accidentally or in Billies case wrecked emotionally. Cotillard is a tightly wound bundle of nerves in a movie that is otherwise unfeeling. Opposite her Depps brand of brooding wilts. Shes clearly taken with him -- and has to be for the movie -- but Depp coasts solely on his pout his dark brown eyes and his relentless inscrutability. The story reaches its inevitable end outside the Biograph Theater where Purvis and his agents position themselves for an ambush. Theres nothing to feel once Dillinger hits the pavement but ""Public Enemies"" almost rights itself by checking in with Billie before the credits roll. If the fire in Cotillards eyes in this final scene had been matched by Depp and Bale throughout ""Public Enemies"" mightve really popped. Instead despite all the fireworks its chamber is empty. For 2 hours 20 minutes it simply goes click click click. Public Enemies (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for gangster violence and some objectionable language. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  So Much Firepower So Little Heat in Soulless Enemies Find Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Public Enemies",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/30/AR2009063004267.html,200,publicenemies21,publicenemies,washingtonpost

Nobody seems to wonder where somebodys going."" So says the Depression-era bank-robber-cum-folk-hero John Dillinger upon surveying the clientele of a chic Chicago eatery in a key scene from Michael Manns Public Enemies. And much like its subject Manns exhilarating movie exists in a state of perpetual forward motion.Dillinger (played superbly by Johnny Depp) spends most of the movie on the run and so does the movie itself. But even when Dillinger is at rest--in those moments when he finds himself in jail or in the arms of a woman--Public Enemies exudes a nervous tension the sense that flight is imminent. (One of the tensest scenes takes place at a traffic light.) Its a feeling that Mann intensifies by shooting the entire movie with a battery of high-definition video cameras--most of them handheld--that record the action in violent jolts and swooshes the way things might look if Dillinger were still robbing banks today his exploits captured by camera phones and broadcast over YouTube. The result like Bonnie and Clyde 40 years earlier is a period gangster movie that scarcely feels period at all.Visually Public Enemies seems like the summation of something Mann has been steadily building toward ever since he first incorporated video-shot footage into the dynamic opening training montage of Ali in 2001. Where digital methods have gradually become the industry standard by simulating the dense luxuriant textures of film Mann embraces video precisely for the ways in which it is unlike film for the hyper-real clarity of its images for the way the lightweight cameras move through space and for its ability to see sharper and more deeply into his beloved night. At every turn Mann rejects classical notions of cinematic ""beauty"" and formulates new ones. The sounds and images rush at you headlong and before you can fully get a handle on them something else takes their place. (I am haunted by one particular shot of Dillinger being wakened by gunshots the camera springing off his body as if it too had been startled from sleep.)Dramatically the movie offers a variation on a favored Mann theme--an elegant professional criminal and a dogged lawman (here Christian Bales implacable ""G-Man"" Melvin Purvis) pursuing each other into an existential void. Compelled by processes Mann saturates Public Enemies with vivid details never belabored of 30s-era intelligence-gathering techniques and the minutiae of Dillingers balletic jailbreaks. Although the credits say that the screenplay was adapted by Mann and two other writers from Vanity Fair reporter Bryan Burroughs 600-page account of the 1930s interstate crime wave and the rise of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover (played by a very amusing Billy Crudup) the movie Mann has made more often suggests a redo of his own 1995 crime saga Heat though reduced nearly to the point of abstraction. There are long stretches in Public Enemies when it feels as if Mann like the French noir master Jean-Pierre Melville at his most elemental would be happy to film nothing but men in tailored suits and charcoal overcoats slicing through landscapes illuminating the night with bursts of yellow gunfire. Some storied members of Dillingers gang are barely afforded a line of dialogue while Dillinger himself emerges as the tersest in Manns gallery of flinty self-aware men of action. In lieu of crackling monologues Depp says simply ""Im John Dillinger. I rob banks."" Likewise those robberies are brisk expedient affairs rarely lasting more than two minutes each. Where Mann staged the heist sequences at the center of Thief and Heat as a kind of grand opera Dillingers are closer to proletariat street theater.Dillinger talks about getting out of this racket of making one last score and then dropping off the map with his lover the French-Native American coat check girl Billie Frechette (an excellent Marion Cotillard) but even as hes saying it we (and she) dont quite believe it. He seems no more able to stop robbing banks than Mann is to stop making movies. Fittingly those two obsessions--filmmaking and law-breaking--converge in Dillingers storied last stand at Chicagos Biograph Theater.Onscreen at the Biograph that fateful night was Manhattan Melodrama a surprisingly unsentimental proto-Mann 1934 crime drama starring Clark Gable and William Powell as childhood friends who grow up on opposite sides of the law--one a small-time hood the other a D.A.--and compete for the affections of the same woman (Myrna Loy). What Mann and Depp do in that scene as Dillinger watches this parallel version of his own life ranks among the cinemas most eloquent depictions of the way the spectator identifies with the moving image. ""Die the way you lived. Dont drag it out"" says Gable shortly before being escorted to the electric chair--words that cut to the essence of Dillinger himself as well as Manns career-long interest in men who live by their own codes outside the strictures of normal society. Seeing Dillingers face in the reflected light of the screen its as if he sensed even then that while his own mortality lay in wait his legend would long continue to flicker.

In the hands of Michael Mann the film looks great feels deliberate and effectively explores our cultures fascination with outlaws. While I dont think Id hand it an Oscar or go door-to-door to sell it to folks Id say its a nice Saturday or Sunday afternoon at the theater. Whats it all about? Its the story of John Dillinger see. Sorry. Had to break into 20s style speak-easy talk for a moment there though of course this story takes place almost entirely in the 30s. Dillinger for a time was the most infamous bank robber out there. He was also a national hero in some circles akin to a modern-day Robin Hood. John Dillinger had the nation captivated with his every move and a fledgling FBI (under J. Edgar Hoover) was fighting a legitimate PR and logistical battle to take down the notorious thief. The star power assembled for Public Enemies is prodigious. Johnny Depp slips into the lead role as Dillinger; he brings depth and complexity to the chameleon. Christian Bale is FBI special agent Melvin Purvis the man tasked with bringing Dillinger and his gang to justice. Bales natural ability to seem constantly beleaguered acquits him well here. I didnt love the role Marion Cotillard was given as Dillingers girlfriend Evelyn ""Billie"" Frechette. Though the screenplay hints at the troublesome aspects that would confront a woman in Frechettes position Cotillard herself isnt given much more do to than to look pained. The relationship and romance angle feels forced ... and while Bale and Depp are encouraged to run around and wreak havoc Cotillard is often left on the sidelines with little to do beside prepare for the next ""lovey-dovey"" scene. Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson are sprinkled into the narrative for color a fine opportunity to learn about the gangsters you might have missed in your ""Early Criminals 101"" class. Public Enemies has a lot of Road to Perdition in it though it has elements of Heat and The Aviator too. It feels timeless as if you could show it at a film school and receive disparate guesses as to when it was created. Theres been a bit of chat on the Internet regarding the use of handheld cameras by Mann; I barely noticed so it appears he wove them in seamlessly. The very thing that makes Public Enemies pleasant to watch also prohibits it from being an instant classic -- I speak of the meandering pace. Where Heat and Collateral immerse you in the precious virtue of now Public Enemies takes a more circumspect route. John Dillinger was seemingly heavy on flash and light on substance but Mann goes the opposite route to tell his story. Hes built a product here that wont necessarily dazzle ... but will stand the test of time.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Few directors capture seemingly accidental bits of lyrical business quite as well as Michael Mann. Early in Public Enemies Manns telling of John Dillingers famed battle with law enforcement a woman whose home serves as a hideout for gangsters begs Dillinger (Johnny Depp) to take her with him. He politely refuses but hesitates as the camera shakily reveals the woman and her child in front of a farmhouse sinking into Depression-era decay. Hes about to hit the dangerous open road. Shes stuck but also rooted. Each lives a life the other will never have and will probably lay awake wanting at least once in a while. Its a remarkable fleeting moment in a movie that often struggles to live up to the power of its best scenes. Mann sets a struggle between cops and criminals against a landscape thats changing on both sides of the law. Dillingers a bank robber but bank robbery is starting to give way to more sophisticated criminal enterprises. Hes pursued in full view of the public by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) a tireless enforcer who without volunteering has become the flag-bearer for a J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) PR campaign to expand the powers of his Bureau Of Investigation to the federal level. Mann fills the background with a lot of fascinating detail but often has a hard time keeping the foreground in focus. Sometimes literally Mann and cinematographer Dante Spinotti opt for hard handheld digital-video images. These lend a sense of excitement to some of the action scenes--particularly a thrilling nighttime chase through the Wisconsin woods--but often give the film an unpleasantly unfinished look. That unfortunately matches an unfinished feel. Neither Depp nor Bale get a chance to get beneath the surface of their characters supporting characters bleed together and a love story between Depp and his moll (Marion Cotillard) never finds a heartbeat. Mann as ever remains a master of methodical pursuit but as the film inches toward Dillingers fateful night at Chicagos Biograph Theater he doesnt offer much beyond methodical pursuit. Depp goes about the business of not getting caught; Bale goes about the business of catching him. In the end it doesnt really come to mean all that much. Mann reduces a legendary game of cat-and-mouse to the size of a standard police procedural. His refusal to mythologize Dillingers exploits is audacious but too much of Public Enemies feels disappointingly smaller than life.

"Public Enemies movie review - Public Enemies showtimes - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Public Enemies Shoot-outs and a script full of holes Johnny Depp displays plenty of screen magnetism as legendary bank robber John Dillinger in Micheal Manns ""Public Enemies."" (Peter Mountain) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / July 1 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + How could ""Public Enemies go wrong? The director is Michael Mann one of the smartest mainstream mavericks working. Star Johnny Depp brings his sizable intelligence and charisma to bear on the role of John Dillinger the legendary Depression-era bank robber. Christian Bale plays Dillingers implacable FBI hellhound Melvin Purvis. The shoot-outs have been shot with a fastidiousness that extends to using actual historical locations. The lead actress won an Oscar for playing Edith Piaf.The parts in other words promise a brilliant whole. So why is this movie one of the signal disappointments of the year? You have to go back to the basics ""Public Enemies has everything going for it except a reason and a script. Do you really need either when Depp is up there giving a working definition of star power? Surprisingly yes.Adapting Bryan Burroughs 2004 popular history of the same name Mann and co-screenwriters Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman jettison context and drop us in the middle of things Its 1934 and Dillinger is breaking a group of confederates including mentor Walter Dietrich (James Russo) out of the state prison in Michigan City Ind.Actually Im guessing Dietrich is his mentor since the movie never makes clear who he is. It isnt very clear about anything other than that John Dillinger was an exceptionally cool dude who robbed banks for a living. ""Public Enemies presents him as living wholly in the moment - hes a successful Zen sociopath - and takes a similar present-tense approach to its storytelling. We dont learn anything about Dillingers background or the reasons for his behavior. He is who he is and who he is is a mystery.OK. Other movies have been made from this existential-bad- ass cloth and better ones. ""Public Enemies works fitfully on a scene-by-scene basis but theres nothing to fit the pieces together and after a while you realize the movies not about anything. No larger idea enlivens its 143 minutes other than that Dillinger was a folk hero and FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) was a fame whore. Mann just follows the chronology and sends us home.For the second movie in a season Christian Bale locks so furiously into a part that you gasp for oxygen whenever hes onscreen. His G-man Purvis has no family no past no nothing other than his mission to scour America of its barnstorming gangsters. ""Public Enemies underscores his decency - hes a better man than his boss Hoover or the FBI underling (Adam Mucci) who roughs up a female suspect - while showing him to be an unstoppable instrument of justice. Hes Dick Tracy no less but unfortunately no more.Mann gets a few interesting scenes out of the FBIs early interest in technology with tapped phone conversations recorded on vinyl LPs but the movies much too slick for any political reading to take hold. ""Public Enemies mostly comes to life during the bank robberies with Dillinger leaping effortlessly across the counters and in the scenes with Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette the gunmans lover. Their first evening beginning in a Chicago nightclub and moving to a fancy restaurant is the one scene where you sense what Mann may have been getting at. Its glamorous and erotic hushed and expectant and much of the pleasure - make that all of the pleasure - is in watching two beautiful people warm slowly to each other. The sequence holds you in the palm of its hand a world unto itself and like the lovers you wish you could stay there forever.But there are people to shoot and historical facts to mangle. I dont mind that Pretty Boy Floyd is introduced and shot dead within the space of 10 seconds but what a waste of Channing Tatum one of our most interesting young actor-hunks. (We dont even see his face clearly.) Gangster movies have always rearranged the particulars to suit whatever romantic Robin Hood notion theyre peddling and ""Public Enemies is no different.That said letting Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) go down in a hail of bullets during the shoot-out at the Little Bohemia Lodge is a flat-out untruth (Nelson was shot and killed in November 1934 four months after Dillingers death and six months after Little Bohemia.) The battle between the ""second Dillinger gang and the FBI is Manns big action set piece - this movies version of the bank shoot-out in ""Heat - and its tense and excitingly filmed. Yet the directors decision to shoot on high-definition video has become a liability by this point with lights in the night-time sequences overmodulating and bleeding onto the film like cheap camcorder shots.Why would Mann and the gifted cinematographer Dante Spinotti do this - intentionally sabotage the look of their film? Are they trying to make the Dillinger story topical by filming it as if it were ""Cops or ""Americas Most Wanted (or a bar mitzvah video)? If so the experiment falls on its face and ""Public Enemies gets stranded between an undersketched past and an irrelevant present.What remains undiminished is Johnny Depps almost unholy screen magnetism. The actor looks surprisingly like Dillinger - a movie-star version anyway - and the trim moustache and blocky bad-boy haircut become him. He gives the criminal shades of confidence and quiet daring and behind it all an unsolved melancholy thats the movies one fresh note. In a lovely scene late in the game Dillinger walks unnoticed through Purviss local FBI headquarters marveling silently at the piles of evidence that have failed to capture him.In another the hero spends his final evening in a movie theater watching the MGM gangster film ""Manhattan Melodrama and Mann cuts back and forth between Clark Gable onscreen Dillinger in the audience and the gathering agents outside. The scene shows a public enemy communing with his Hollywood twin but its really about one generations king tipping his hat to anothers. The hat fits even if the movie around him doesnt.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

(Ellen Dunkel)By Steven Rea INQUIRER MOVIE CRITICPosted June 30 2009The 1930s gangster movie is back.Does anybody care?Public Enemies set in the ""golden age of bank robbery"" when the likes of Baby Face Nelson Ma and Pa Barker and Bonnie and Clyde were looting and shooting across the land is the first A-list Depression-era crime pic since Brian DePalmas The Untouchables.And like the 87 hit Michael Manns burnished new enterprise pits two mighty stars opposite each other. (And showcases Chicagos palatial Union Station too.)The G-man? Melvin Purvis played with steely - and squinting - determination by Christian Bale.And the bad guy? John Dillinger the cool and elusive stickup artist with Johnny Depp swaggering jauntily in a wardrobe of nifty suits as the famous outlaw.Full of rocketing DeSotos and crackling shootouts in the woods Public Enemies looks and feels as though it should work. The bank jobs (innumerable) and prison breaks (two) are staged with cross-cutting zeal. Manns longtime cinematographer Dante Spinotti imbues the 30s decor and sets with sleekness and cool (deploying lots of vertiginous handheld shots) and Billie Holiday works her melancholy magic on the soundtrack.But ultimately the movies a bust. In a recent interview in the New York Times Mann laid out his artistic mission for the film (SPOILER ALERT ahead for the history-challenged)""You know John Dillinger is going to die"" Mann said. ""So . . . the story has to have hijacked the show-and-tell nature of the plot. The story has to be about the inner experience of the guy so that by the end its not about him getting shot. Do you understand his inner experience? Is your heart with him? Do you know him? Thats the battle.""A battle lost.Inner experience comes down to a couple of lines of Depps Dillinger muttering like a Zen heistman ""Were having too good a time today aint thinking about tomorrow.""His romance with a French-Indian hat-check girl Billie Frechette (Oscar-winning Edith Piaf portraitist Marion Cotillard) is presented as soul-shaking but whether its Cotillards difficulty with the English dialogue or just the fundamental inadequacy of that dialogue the love between these two doesnt seem epic. In fact Cotillards best scene comes in the epilogue when shes face-to-face with a G-man - intense her eyes on fire and streaking tears at the same time.Public Enemies isnt a total wash. The nascent days of forensic sleuthing - wire taps the ""scientific"" approach to crime-stopping as Purvis puts it - are depicted in fascinating detail. As is the birth of the FBI and the blustery J. Edgar Hoover (a staccato Billy Crudup). And no film in which so many fine talents show up even fleetingly can be a complete waste Lili Taylor as an Indiana sheriff Leelee Sobieski as a Chicago hooker and an uncharacteristically understated Giovanni Ribisi as another of the legendary bagmen of the time Alvin Karpis.As Public Enemies navigates toward its finale Mann mounts a terrific scene of Dillinger in his seat at the Biograph Theater taking in Clark Gable William Powell and Myrna Loy in the 1934 crime pic Manhattan Melodrama.Depp and Gable have the same mustache going. But the movie that Gables in seems a whole lot more interesting than the one from which Depps John Dillinger is about to make his fateful exit.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Johnny Depp as John Dillinger in Public Enemies. A poet of mayhem offers only guns and poses Add to ... Liam Lacey From Wednesdays Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 30 2009 421PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Public Enemies Directed by Michael Mann Written by Michael Mann Anne Biderman and Ronan Bennett Starring Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard Classification 14A Michael Manns lush and long biographical film about the famed 1930s bank robber John Dillinger has soft and oily murderous night scenes. Gun muzzles blaze white in the indigo night. Shots ring out in a symphony of different rhythms and registers. By day the dapper Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and his gang treat a bank robbery like a ballet leaping over counters pouring cash into bags and jumping into gleaming black Fords. Dillinger whose brief bank-robbing career paralleled the heyday of the Hollywood 1930s gangster film should have been a natural fit for Mann. From his first feature Thief  through his TV series Miami Vice and Crime Story to the epic cops and robbers duel in Heat  Mann has shown himself a poet of shoot em up mayhem. Public Enemies should have been his grand opus. Instead the film feels restrained and pictorial. Compared with the convulsions of Bonnie and Clyde  The Godfather or Brian De Palmas The Untouchables  or the raging gangster flicks of the Thirties its a coffee-table book. Dialogue is mumbled sometimes inaudible. A stream of familiar faces (Giovanni Ribisi Channing Tatum Stephen Dorff Lili Taylor and Leelee Sobieski) flit by. Dramatic momentum is sacrificed in the scrambled script (based on journalist Bryan Burroughs book and written by Mann with Ann Biderman and Ronan Bennett) which attempts to blend docudrama social history and fanciful romance. The best part is the docudrama which walks us through the legendary heists and escapes in detail from the time of Dillingers escape from an Indiana prison in 1933 to his death at the hands of federal agents in Chicago 14 months later. The highlight is an FBI night raid on Dillinger and his cohorts holed up in Wisconsins Little Bohemia lodge as cinematographer Dante Spinottis high-definition-video cinematography shows the blackest night in lustrous intensity. Less engaging is the jumpy social-history focus on the efforts of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup suggesting weird psychosexual undercurrents) and the tightly wound federal agent Melvyn Purvis (Christian Bale) to establish the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a national crime-fighting tool. The story unfolds through flashbulb-flare press conferences and urgent phone calls. Bale Crudup and Depp are all dark-haired similarly dressed and coiffed; the film might have been called Men with Cheekbones. The FBI in its early days is hindered by Hoovers prissy insistence that his agents be clean-cut and above reproach but the criminals easily outsmart and out-gun them. To convey Purviss relentlessness his pursuit is accompanied by the urgent banjo line of Otis Taylors 10 Million Slaves . Challenging Hoovers methods he sends for some real Texas killers to do the dirty work. Some of federal agents play rough using ""vigorous physical interviews"" (a.k.a. torture) to extract information. They smack around Dillingers gal Billy Frechette (Marion Cotillard) like a terrorism suspect. As part of the social history we also see Dillingers downfall isnt just because of the FBI but also because of Frank Nitti Al Capones No. 2 who runs the mobs gambling syndicate and who clamps down on the rogue bank robber for bringing federal heat down on his interstate operations. Whats strangely missing from this social picture is any image of the economic misery that made Dillinger a folk hero. Finally theres the romance which is historically fanciful dreamy and lacking in fleshly immediacy. Cotillard last years Oscar winner for La Vie en Rose  is a hat-check girl he meets at a nightclub and sweeps off her feet while Diana Krall croons a velvety version of Bye Bye Blackbird from a stage. Somethings askew here. Manns HD video so effective in night scenes isnt kind in close-ups and Cotillard whose French accent always feels a whisper away looks tired with dark circles under her eyes. In contrast Depp in his mid-40s looks far younger and softer than the real Dillinger did when he was gunned down at 31. As if still in Captain Jack mode Depp inadvertently suggests the possibility that Public Enemy No. 1 wore Guyliner. More puzzling Depps mildly mocking low-key charm makes his character inscrutable. Instead of a sociopath hes a princely fellow who likes fine things financed by other peoples earnings. Theres just a suggestion that Dillinger may have confused himself with a movie character. We see him in a Chicago theatre raptly registering every scene of a gangster flick Manhattan Melodrama (the script won an Oscar) with Clark Gable and William Powell before stepping out into the street to meet his death. Perhaps the most regrettable crime here is the way that Mann trying to do too much robs himself of a great opportunity. Here was a chance to capture the drama of the Thirties a decade when the Hollywood imagination machine was at its most potent when movie dreams and tales of bullet-spattering madmen held the collective imagination.

The fatally miscast Johnny Depps smaller-than-life performance as the famed gangster is the central flaw in Michael Manns disappointing curiously uninvolving ""Public Enemies."" Depp is one of my favorite actors but stepping out of a long string of fantasy roles he lacks the requisite menace to play Dillinger who topped the FBIs first Most Wanted list -- unlike Lawrence Tierney and Warren Oates who portrayed truly frightening Dillingers in earlier eras. READ How Depp Became Eternally Cool PHOTOS Johnny Depp MOVIE BLOG Killer Dillingers POPWRAP Johnny vs. Christian The Years Sexiest Dilemma This boyish Dillinger weeps and sings a cappella but theres little in Depps very restrained performance -- or the severely underwritten script -- to explain what makes him tick or how he became a criminal mastermind during a 10-year prison stretch for stealing 20 worth of groceries. Mann perhaps the most overrated director working today for all his considerable visual flair seems more interested in big set pieces like the rousing 1933 prison break that opens the movie. He stages some of the best machine-gun battles in Hollywood history but its hard to care about the thinly drawn characters and the underdeveloped historical context is particularly exasperating. You would hardly know the Great Depression has hit its depths for all the fancy costumes and the shiny cars all of which look like theyve just been driven off the lot. That makes it hard to understand why Dillinger became a hero in some quarters for robbing banks -- all are imposingly grand here in contrast to the small-town banks Dillinger favored for his real-life exploits. Far too much time is squandered on the doomed chemistry-free romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette a half-French hatcheck girl uneasily played by Marion Cotillard (Best Actress Oscar winner for ""La Vie en Rose"") whose interest in fugitive Dillinger seems fairly inexplicable. And then theres the black hole known as Christian Bale who is relentlessly boring as Melvin Purvis the heroic G-man (the real-life model for Dick Tracy) assigned to bring Dillinger to justice. ""Public Enemies"" is more like a historical costume pageant than a character-driven drama with a huge terrific cast wasted in what amount to thankless bit parts including Billy Crudup (J. Edgar Hoover) Channing Tatum (""Pretty Boy"" Floyd) and Giovanni Ribisi (Alvin Karpis). Dillingers famous slaying outside Chicagos Biograph Theater in 1934 following a showing of the gangster flick ""Manhattan Melodrama"" (which Mann samples inviting unfavorable comparison) seems almost anticlimactic since the events leading up to Dillingers betrayal -- by mob boss Frank Nitti (Bill Camp) and the madam known as ""The Lady in Red"" -- are so perfunctorily sketched. Theres no adequate explanation why Dillinger supposedly despondent because Billie has been captured spends his last hours in the company of another hastily introduced girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski). There is a halfhearted effort to create a point of entry for contemporary audiences by focusing on the FBIs more dubious interrogation methods which Mann seems to be implicitly comparing with post-9/11 federal tactics. Even the expertly choreographed gun battles get redundant at a certain point. It doesnt help that the movies huge climax -- an FBI raid on a Wisconsin lodge where Dillinger and his men are staying -- is so dimly lit that its difficult to tell the characters apart a situation not helped by often hard-to-understand dialogue. Though Im not a big Mann fan I was looking forward to ""Public Enemies"" more than any other movie this season. Sadly this misfire is no classic like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" -- its not even as good as ""The Untouchables."" PUBLIC ENEMIES Shooting blanks. Running time 133 minutes.

""Public Enemies"" Movie Review -- There are a lot of stories to tell about John Dillinger. Theres the one about how a poor boy from Indiana became a famous bank robber -- and in those worst years of the Depression caught the peoples fancy. Theres the one about how he was tracked down by Melvin Purvis a single-minded agent from J. Edgar Hoovers publicity-conscious Federal Bureau of Investigation. Public Enemies (R) Universal (143 min.) Directed by Michael Mann. With Johnny Depp Christian Bale Billy Crudup Marion Cotillard. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains violence and sexual situations. Theres even the one about Dillingers traitorous ""Lady in Red"" not to mention all the highly exaggerated if not fictitious claims about Dillingers prowess as a lover. But after seeing ""Public Enemies"" Im still not sure which story Michael Mann wanted to tell. The movie is meticulously crafted and edited as all of Manns movies are. Its well acted -- by a refreshingly restrained Johnny Depp as Dillinger and Christian Bale finally dropping the raspy superhero voice as the methodical Purvis. But whats the real story on screen? And why did Mann feel he had to tell it now? In addition to the Dillinger myth the Purvis pursuit and the Dillinger women -- all of which get their time here -- there are even some attempts at political commentary as we see the pompous Hoover (well played by Billy Crudup) twisting the law to fight his ""war on crime."" Newspaper columnists are spoon-fed and manipulated. Photo ops are arranged. Innocents become collateral damage in clumsy government raids and suspects are tortured into (often false) confessions. Yes we get the message. But its not quite as novel as Mann seems to think. These parallels have been cropping up for a while in movies from ""Appaloosa"" to Bales own ""The Dark Knight""; they havent gotten any fresher since. Nor is Manns approach to Dillinger clear. On one hand his film seems to have a man-crush on this felon depicting him as loyal tragic stylish and far more interesting than the lawmen who went after him. Yet on the other it ignores the most interesting aspects of the real man -- his physical grace his hunger for celebrity and his sly humor (he once posed as an alarm salesman to get guided tours of bank security systems). Of course the film still works as a basic cops-and-robbers picture. One sequence detailing a disastrous shootout at a safe house in Wisconsin shows Mann at his best and recalls the L.A. bank robbery from his own ""Heat"" full of visceral excitement and blood-pounding style. Thats because Mann unlike many younger directors still has a classicists sense. Sequences arent cut so frantically that we cant tell whos doing what to whom; shots are framed carefully enough that we always know just where the hunted is in relation to the hunters. The picture also has a novel look eschewing the standard cinematography of modern period pictures -- all slanting venetian-blind shadows and caramel-colored interiors -- for flat even lighting and a palette of grays. Mann remains with Ridley Scott the best pictorialist in the business. Yet hes not immune to performance. Marion Cotillard is terrific as Dillingers girlfriend. And the closing moments -- as Depp sits in a movie theater watching ""Manhattan Melodrama"" and seeing himself in its fatalistic end -- are a fine bit of acting and directing. But to what point? Weve had half a dozen portrayals of Dillinger over the years not to mention of his cohorts Purvis himself and of course Hoover. What is the brand-new angle that justifies telling it again and at length? Whats the reason to make this movie now? It doesnt seem to be a question Mann ever asked himself. Its certainly not one this handsome -- but long and slightly empty -- movie ever answers. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Public Enemies Director Michael Mann. Cast Johnny Depp Christian Bale Marion Cotillard. Rating Rated R for gangster violence and some language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Johnny Depp turns gangster in Public Enemies Hollywoods most wanted look familiar Accent was welcome task for Marion Cotillard Gangster movies Spotlight Johnny Depp Spotlight Christian Bale Should have been even. With the talent involved expectations were plenty high. Michael Mann directs the story of John Dillinger (at least the final chapter) with Johnny Depp as the gangster and Marion Cotillard as his love interest. Christian Bale is on hand as the FBI agent obsessed with bringing Dillinger in one way or another. But the movie plays ultimately like a victory of style over substance. Thats often true of Manns movies on first viewing; they age well. Perhaps that will be the case with ""Public Enemies."" Well see but for now it feels like a near miss. Bale is the biggest problem. Hes miscast as Melvin Purvis burdened with a terrible Southern accent (even more annoying than his constant gravelly voice when donning cape and mask in the ""Dark Knight"" films). The idea evidently is that Purvis and Dillinger are equally devoted to their tasks even if theyre on opposite sides of the law. But the Purvis character is underwritten. While clearly intent on running down Dillinger does he sacrifice family and friends in the pursuit? Does it take a toll on his personal life? Dunno. He just shows up now and again seething whenever Dillinger slips through the bureaus fingers (which is often). Depp is quite good as Dillinger a criminal at the height of his powers. The Depression drags on and people see Dillinger as a sort of folk hero; he robs banks not the people in them (""Im not here for your money"" he tells a man who has offered his cash). Hes all about id; he lives completely in the moment evidently either aware that the good times wont last forever or unconcerned that theyll end. What do you want Billie (Cotillard) asks as he courts her? ""Everything"" Dillinger replies. ""Right now."" Another time when warned theres an expiration date on his exploits Dillinger replies ""Were having too good a time today. We aint thinking about tomorrow."" Purvis is. He has to with J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) breathing down his neck. Hoover is bent on creating a national bureau to track criminals down across state lines. Crudup has a ball and is immensely enjoyable as the egotistical officious Hoover conveying the complexity of the character in a few appearances. Manns direction is at times stunning. He uses close-ups extensively demanding that you dont break eye contact with the characters. In one scene Dillinger flees through a forest at night. Mann holds the frame on Depps face while in the background employing a depth-of-field Orson Welles might envy we see agents scrambling behind him. The effect heightens the tension and is enormously fun to watch. Mann brings the film into the present with a harrowing scene in which agents brutalize Billie to get information on Dillinger; any and all references to the current debate about torture are doubtless intentional and welcome. In fact despite Depps best efforts and Cotillards always-luminous presence Mann is the star here. But theres a distance between the audience and the film that cant quite be overcome. The effort on all fronts is outstanding. The execution alas particularly in the case of Bales character is not. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By David Denby Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger in Michael Manns film.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" is a ravishing dream of violent gangster life in the thirties--not a tough funny and finally tragic dream like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" but a flowing velvety fantasia of the crime wave that mesmerized the nation early in the decade. The scowling men in long dark coats and hats led by the fashion-plate bandit John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) march into a grand Midwestern bank with marble floors and brass railings take over the place throw the cash in bags and make their getaway jumping onto the sideboards of flat-topped black Fords--beautiful cars with curved grilles and rounded headlights that stand straight up from the cars bodies. Its the American poetry of crime. Throughout the movie blazing tommy guns emit little spearheads of flame just as in a comic book. Men get their skulls bashed with gun butts and get thrown out of cars but despite all the violence the movie is aesthetically shaped and slightly distanced by the pictorial verve of gangland effrontery--the public aggression that Mann makes inseparable from high style. He keeps the camera moving and the editing (by Paul Rubell and Jeffrey Ford) reinforces the speed without jamming ragged fragments together in the manner of hack filmmaking. As a piece of direction ""Public Enemies"" is often breathtakingly fast but its always lucid. The high-definition digital images are crisply focussed and much of the movie (in contrast to the usual shock-and-awe thunder of action films) is on the quiet side. Billie Holidays plaintive tones show up on the soundtrack a touch of melancholy high civilization amid the mayhem. Some of the dialogue is spoken sotto voce--in a darkened restaurant say or the back of a car where suave hoods lean toward each other exchanging confidences. Like Barry Levinsons ""Bugsy"" the picture happily exploits what movies can do to create a sinful nexus between criminality and elegance. Dillinger himself went to the movies on the last night of his life (an event recreated here); at times he seemed to be modelling himself on the dapper William Powell. Most of the thugs and the lawmen too dress in perfectly tailored suits and wear their pomaded hair swept back like the grilles of those fast cars. Theres almost an unspoken compact between director and audience in a movie like this a compact of pleasure in everything looking so good. Twenty-five years ago in ""Miami Vice"" Michael Mann brought visual glamour to television; hes still an incomparable maker of svelte flawlessly integrated images. Yet for all its skill ""Public Enemies"" is not quite a great movie. Theres something missing--a sense of urgency and discovery a more complicated narrative path a shrewder tougher sense of who John Dillinger is. The bank robber had a brief run as a national figure. Paroled after nearly nine years in the Indiana pen on May 10 1933 he rampaged his way around the country often living openly in Chicago and smaller cities and was shot dead by a variety of cops and agents fourteen months later on July 22 1934. As the movie tells it (Mann wrote the screenplay with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman adapting Bryan Burroughs 2004 book also called ""Public Enemies"") Dillinger was a gentleman thug loyal to his friends and to his hat-check girlfriend Billie Frechette played by Marion Cotillard with a combination of desperate hope and fear that is enormously appealing. Relaxed and assured Depp with his fine sharply cut features and lithe body turns Dillinger into a supremely confident young man. ""What do you want?"" Cotillard asks him. ""Everything right now"" he says. Its the quintessential movie gangsters demand although Depp speaks softly without the snarling boastfulness of the great actors (Paul Muni James Cagney Edward G. Robinson) who played gangsters when Dillinger was alive. Theres a faint tone of mockery in Depps mildness in his secret half smile though his face can darken with rage. Mann and Depps idea of Dillinger as an unruffled prince of crime is extremely enjoyable. Yet as the movie goes on you begin to question whether it makes much sense. ""Public Enemies"" chronicles not only Dillingers wild fourteen months but the parallel rise of organized crime (represented as an Italian gent in a dressing gown giving orders on the telephone) and also the development of a national crime-fighting force--a nascent F.B.I. Billy Crudup who has done inventive work onstage in recent years returns to the movies with a brilliant piece of high comedy. His cheekbones built up his handsome features on the verge of disappearing into jowls he plays the young but already insufferable J. Edgar Hoover as a bullying righteous and wary man a natural-born populist authoritarian. One of Manns wittiest accomplishments is to recapture the stiffly formal side of official life in the thirties the pompous tone of bureaucracy and media too--the sound of a newly powerful country trying to impress itself with its own importance. Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) whom Hoover puts in charge of the Dillinger hunt acts out the role of a formidable national guardian. In the past Bales guttural delivery as if his vocal chords were soaked daily in testosterone never seemed anything but an actors trick. Hes a tight dour minimalist performer not very likable. But hes effective here as a man driven by a single purpose--to see Dillinger dead one way or another. Bale makes Purvis very still very concentrated the frightening embodiment of the Law. Outgunned at first by the criminals Purvis with Hoover pretending not to notice hires some trained killers from Oklahoma and Texas. The rival gangs of outlaws and ""lawmen"" duel back and forth and the movie rushes through increasingly vicious gun battles and narrow escapes for Dillinger and his friends. Some of the shoot-outs--especially a mad nighttime pursuit of the irrepressibly gun-happy Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham)--are as flamboyant and as satisfying as a dream. But Mann oddly doesnt seem to take sides. In ""Bonnie and Clyde"" we were clearly meant to warm up to the outlaws--not just to the two lovers but to the entire group who became an extended quarrelling family and also folk heroes in a Depression-era country both bored and broke. But Dillingers popularity is only hinted at in a couple of scenes and Mann as he did in ""Heat"" divides his admiration evenly between criminals and cops. Both are risking everything. The movie is structured around repeated scenes of wounded men (agents as well as criminals) dying as they look into the eyes of their friends. Yet some of the dying men are barely known to us and the device though beautifully staged in each case doesnt have the power it should have had. The movie is emotionally neutered. ""Public Enemies"" needed a charge of surprise and I wish the filmmakers had more forcefully developed two ironies embedded in the material. For all of Hoover and Purviss talk of ""scientific methods"" the new F.B.I. wins the war not by arresting criminals and sending them to prison but by massacring them. And Dillinger as the movie readily shows is deluded about himself. He embraces the future but actually his time is over; the new crime syndicates dismiss him as a troublemaking fool. And although the screenplay keeps insisting that hes intelligent and shrewd the movie demonstrates the opposite. The character doesnt quite add up. If he had been given a wild destructive streak the conception might have made more sense but Mann seems to trip over his own story by making Dillinger so self-contained and cool. The problem with casting a star as low-key and attractive as Johnny Depp is that you cant turn him into a man who is at bottom a loser. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" directed by the stunningly almost viciously untalented Michael Bay is much closer to the norm of todays conglomerate filmmaking. Two sets of leaden-voiced plastic-and-metal monsters the Autobots and the Decepticons having failed to settle their differences over a parking space on an alien planet fight it out on Earth--with human beings in the dubious form of the teen couple Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in the middle. Apart from the frustrating truth that its often impossible to tell the warring creatures apart--both sets are huge black gleaming clanking with many arms and appendages--they obey no rules that would make their combats a struggle of courage against limitation and therefore worth caring about. Achilles and Hector had spears and shields. These things can fly climb knock over walls bore holes change shape back into cars or trucks dance the cancan in the pre-First World War Folies-Bergere. There isnt much they cant do and their endless struggles are redundant and undifferentiated. The movie rages on for a hundred and fifty minutes and then just stops pausing for the next sequel. In the middle of the battles the American military in the form of recruiting-poster scrambles in the Egyptian desert joins the creatures in destroying the Pyramids and other temples columns and monoliths. Its all a rambunctious movie lark of course but if you were an Egyptian wouldnt you be a little annoyed by the casual imperial thwacking of sacred places?

Michael Mann ambitiously tries to forge the historical iconographic and cultural aspects of American gangsterdom in ""Public Enemies"" with results more admirable than electrifying. Centering on bank robber John Dillinger the most publicized of the many Depression-era outlaws whose transgressions fostered the rise of the FBI Hollywoods specialist in great-looking crime stories has put images on the screen that are compelling to watch even though the overall impact is muted. Oddly too the film is somewhat shortchanged by its great star Johnny Depp who disappointingly has chosen to play Dillinger as self-consciously cool rather than earthy and gregarious. With dark commercial clouds currently hovering over expensive big-star vehicles and period pieces Universal has no choice but to push the film hard as a glamorous gangbuster entertainment which it is only in part. Mid-level biz is most likely. For all his celebrity Dillinger has only fronted two previous Hollywood features and low-budgeters at that Max Nossecks undistinguished wildly fictional 1945 Monogram cheapie starring a tough Lawrence Tierney and John Milius uneven 1973 AIP effort in which Warren Oates performance emphasized the anti-heros folksy and funny sides. Neither is very satisfactory leaving a void ""Public Enemies"" endeavors to fill with a full-canvas approach that inspired by the enormous detail provided by Bryan Burroughs terrific 2004 book hews with considerable although not complete fidelity to the historical record. Like other Mann films this one offers a lot of ominously rumbling meticulously embroidered downtime occasionally interrupted by spasms of violence and action. After briefly alluding to Dillingers prior nine-year prison term the yarn begins cracklingly with the outlaw engineering the mass escape of old cohorts from the Indiana State Penitentiary. The year is 1933 ""the golden age of bank robbery"" as a front title puts it a time when the public readily extended its sympathy to robbers who preyed upon the banks which many blamed for their financial distress. The specific sociopolitical conditions of the time are crucial to the story but one big thing almost entirely missing from ""Public Enemies"" is the Depression itself. Its suggestive of where Manns true interests lie -- or perhaps where they dont -- that one almost never sees poverty desperation or even poor grooming; everyone here wears fabulous clothes and almost always looks their very best. Dillinger most frequently robbed banks in small or medium-sized towns but here he only bothers with vast marble palaces of impeccable design. In Depps unavoidably attractive impersonation Dillinger is a personable somewhat low-key guy whos loyal to his pals and alluring to the ladies particularly to nightclub coat-check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) who quickly becomes his companion. Advised by his smart criminal cohort Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi) that ""what were doin wont last forever"" Dillinger replies that he has thoughts of doing nothing else because hes ""having too much fun."" Karpis proves correct however since J. Edgar Hoovers FBI quickly mobilizes to address the mayhem at large in the countrys heartland. Hoover (Billy Crudup disarmingly good) appoints tight-lipped straight arrow Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to run his Chicago office. Purvis and his crew inexorably put the screws on just as the citys organized crime syndicate run by Al Capones old No. 2 Frank Nitti (Bill Camp) becomes annoyed by the FBI scrutiny aroused by Dillinger and other loose cannons. So ""Public Enemies"" emerges as a formidable tapestry documenting the indelible seismic shifts of large criminal and law enforcement entities that significantly define an era. As before in Manns work there is a magisterial inevitability to the way the opposing forces gradually converge until violent confrontation is inevitable a style that justifies the time and attention to detail involved in creating it. The methodical approach makes the violence particularly startling. The highlight here is a nocturnal attack by Purvis team on Dillinger ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Stephen Graham) and others holed up at the remote Little Bohemia lodge. Much attention is paid to the quality of the gunshots the sounds really pop and Dante Spinottis HD cinematography excels at rendering the darkest possible nighttime blacks upon which the gun blasts expode with bursts of white light. Script by Irish scribe Ronan Bennett Mann and Ann Biderman dives intelligently and deeply into its subject although it is Manns way to deliberately pare connective tissue a strategy magnified here by the unintelligibility of a fair amount of dialogue. The chilliness verging on artiness of the style suggests a director bent on suppressing his instincts as a popular entertainer which would actually be fine if balanced by a warm central performance. Curiously though after letting loose in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" pictures and other films Depp reverts to a more withdrawn self-regarding posture portraying Dillinger as a man who having discovered his role in life determined to play it according to a script of his own devising. Bale plays Purvis as a clenched stoic trying to keep his deep tension bottled up while Cotillard speaking English with just a slight accent is lovely and fine as the lady who wins the bad mans heart. Clad in similar suits and large coats topped by virtually identical haircuts and given few opportunities to pop out of the backgrounds (its a variation on the ""Black Hawk Down"" syndrome) even some of the known secondary players can be difficult to identify. Still one who does shine is Stephen Lang from Manns old ""Crime Story"" TV show terrific as the lawman who utters the films final lines. Ribisi as Karpis Peter Gerety as Dillingers shrewd showboating attorney and Branka Katic as the woman who betrays the outlaw to the feds all have their brief moments. Manns decision to shoot in HD rather than film again has its plusses and minuses; the detail and depth of field are phenomenal in the dark scenes but the bright flaring occasional unnatural movements and excessive detailing of skin flaws remain annoying as does the insubstantiality of the images compared to those created on film. Digital may represent the future but the future is not entirely here yet and the pictorial qualities of Manns films prior to ""Collateral"" remain decisively superior to the recent trio. Other production qualities are exceptional across the board and extensive location work in Illinois and Wisconsin pays off in physical authenticity. Elliot Goldenthals brooding score combines with period music to create an effectively eclectic soundtrack.
