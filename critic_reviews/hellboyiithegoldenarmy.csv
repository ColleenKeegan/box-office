"One hell of a hero - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW One hell of a heroGuillermo del Toros Hellboy II is a comic come alive.July 11 2008|Kenneth Turan | Times Movie Critic THE TROUBLE with the current spate of comic-book movies is that their numbing conventionality can make it easy to forget why you loved the original comics back in the day. ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" will help you remember.With movies such as ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Iron Man"" falling off the Hollywood assembly line like so many identical toaster ovens its refreshing to see what happens when a visionary filmmaker such as Guillermo del Toro falls in love with a superhero who was described in the first ""Hellboy"" film as ""6-foot-5 bright red has a tail and is government funded.""Starting with characters created by Mike Mignola for Dark Horse Comics writer-director Del Toro whose one-of-a-kind ""Pans Labyrinth"" won a trio of Oscars in 2007 is almost alone in his ability to re-create on screen the wide-eyed exhilaration and disturbing grotesqueness that is the legacy of reading comics on the page.Ten effects house combined forces and used both computers and practical effects to animate the widest possible range of strange creatures allowing ""Hellboy II"" to come alive with fantasy and invention. To see this film beautifully shot by Guillermo Navarro is to truly feel youve entered another world filled with nightmarish things both unimaginable and indescribable.Like the comic book it proudly is ""Hellboy II"" reintroduces us to the trio of superheroes from the first film individuals who like the ""Men in Black"" of a few years back are humanitys only defense against unspeakable evil perpetrated by disturbing creatures who walk among us hidden or in disguise.First among equals at the Bureau of Paranormal Research amp; Defense (B.P.R.D. for short) is hot-tempered Hellboy (Ron Perlman) a reluctant hero always angry because the public never believes hes one of the good guys. Hellboys on-and-off girlfriend is Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) capable of bursting into flames if shes not treated right. The role of sidekick is filled by the all-knowing aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) who has the kind of ageless wisdom apparently only being half-fish and half-mammal can provide.After a brief moment recapping Hellboys origins (he was brought to Earth by Nazi occultists and then liberated by the Allied Forces) the film offers a prologue set in 1955. The young Hellboy is living with his surrogate father Professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm (a cameo by John Hurt one of the stars of the first film) a scientist who tells the young superhero a bedtime story that conveniently provides the back story for the sequel.Sometime in the dark past were told elves and humans fought for control of the Earth. The elf king Balor created a golden mechanical army of huge warriors who ""never knew hunger and could not be stopped."" At the last minute much to the disgust of his confrontational son Prince Nuada the king had second thoughts and locked the fierce army away. Anyone who thinks it will stay locked up doesnt go to a lot of movies.Cut to the present day where the prince (a 1970s Johnny Winter look-alike played by Luke Goss) returns from exile as a man with a plan. Accompanied by the massive troll Mr. Wink he shows up at a posh Manhattan auction house not to bid but to rip and run. Irked at the way humans have destroyed the Earth -- I warned you about buying that Hummer -- he goes against the wishes of his father and his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) and makes plans to wake that sleeping army and take over the planet.Though their personal relationship is anything but calm Hellboy and Liz are still evil-fighting stalwarts. With Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) returning as FBI liaison B.P.R.D. welcomes the unusual Professor Johann Kraus a protoplasmic mystic whatever that is to the team and sets up trying to stop the prince.The parade of creatures Del Toro and his team have come up with as this scenario unfolds starting with a tour of the legendary Troll Market that one-ups the Mos Eisley cantina scene in ""Star Wars"" will make you want to tip your hat in wonder.There is also a giant beanstalk that resembles something out of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ends up like a creature Japanese animator Hiyao Miyazaki might have dreamed up. And the films Angel of Death also acted by Doug Jones (who was Pan in ""Pans Labyrinth"") is everything a creature with that name ought to be.Though ""Hellboy II"" is finally a film taken from a comic book the passion of Del Toro who was so involved with the story he did the creature vocals helps us forget that.More than anything this film makes us eager for Del Toros next announced project J.R.R. Tolkiens ""The Hobbit"" in which the directors prodigious gifts will be combined with one of the great fantasy franchises of modern times. That should really be something to see.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some language.

"Review Hooray for Hellboy II - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Hooray for Hellboy IIStory Highlights CNN.coms Tom Charity ""Hellboy II"" shows more Guillermo del Toro brilliance Ron Perlman is back as the cigar-chomping title character Plot is secondary to amazing characters including a vaporous mass Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Will Smiths Hancock wasnt the first superhero with bad habits and a bad attitude. Hellboy the protagonist of ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" has a bit of the devil in him His skin is red; he has two shorn-off horns on his head a gargantuan club fist and a long slippery tail. Ron Perlman returns in the title role in ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" He also has a down-to-earth side a fondness for Cuban cigars Mexican beer TV and candy. He has a short fuse and hed like a little appreciation for his efforts please. He deserves it too. This rank outsider isnt a billionaire like Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark. Hes not even a scientist like Bruce Banner. Hes more of a working stiff a slugger with a gruff manner and a stogie in the side of his mouth -- but he wants to bat for the right team. (According to writer-artist Mike Mignola the character was inspired by his father a cabinetmaker.) Hellboy -- or ""Red"" to his friends -- has switched studios since his 2004 big-screen debut from Columbia to Universal. Not that it shows. Writer-director Guillermo del Toro is still pulling the strings and the key creative personnel are all back including Ron Perlman in the title role Selma Blair as the pyrokinetic Liz (now Mrs. Hellboy) Doug Jones as the piscine Abe Sapien (the brains to Reds brawn) and -- behind the scenes -- cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and art whizzes Stephen Scott and Peter Francis. Between them they conjure up one hell of a creature feature. ""Hellboy II"" boasts a dazzling multitude of imaginary beings the deceptively delicate tooth fairies (so called because they eat bone with a fondness for teeth in particular); the elfin king whose antlers grow out of his head to form a crown; the plantlike forest god that collapses into a strangely beautiful floral mulch right under the Brooklyn Bridge; the magnificent Angel of Death an old crone who unfurls her wings to reveal a sparkling set of eyes (an avian variation on the creepiest creation in the acclaimed ""Pans Labyrinth"" del Toros last movie). Then theres the redoubtable Johann Kraus an officious but in many ways admirable German who only exists as a vapor trail -- except when hes bottled up in an ingeniously modified but still splendidly archaic deep-sea diving suit. When a filmmaker can invest even a puff of smoke with so much chutzpah you know hes on to something. Its wonderful to see del Toro let his imagination run rampant like this. iReport.com Did you see ""Hellboy II""? Share your review The plot concerns an ancient race thats determined to wage war on humanity but its secondary to del Toros amazing characters. The Mexican directors first Hollywood movies (""Mimic"" and ""Blade II"") were far less distinctive than his Spanish-language films ""Cronos"" ""The Devils Backbone"" and ""Pans Labyrinth."" You couldnt really call ""Hellboy II"" an advance on the latter -- ""Pans"" was nominated for six Oscars and won three -- but its obvious he relishes this material. Its pulpy and hammy and unashamedly lowbrow and del Toro has the confidence and power to make it his own. The film feels very free loose and (unusually for a special-effects picture) improvisational. An outsize personality such as Perlman is in his element here. Even when the wisecracks fall short -- there are an awful lot of ""ass"" gags -- they are closer to the grubby subversive impulses of the comic books than the over-hyped market-tested industrial-strength blockbuster adaptations Hollywood churns out. Its not for nothing that the central tension running through this movie is Reds anarchic streak his sometimes irresponsible need to be his own man in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (the ""X-Men""-like institution where he works) and in his marriage. Scratch the surface and this is a film about love and loyalty figuring out where your deepest bonds lie. Highbrows may damn ""Hellboy II"" as a ""comic book movie"" though even they would have to grant that its wonderful idiosyncrasies indicate brilliance. But its more than that. Hellboy does so much growing up over the course of these 110 minutes we may have to call him ""Hellman"" from now on. Lets hope Universal stays the course and gives us that opportunity. People as creative as del Toro and his gang need all the support we can give them. ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" is rated PG-13 and runs 110 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 12 2008 Save for later Saved Another reluctant superhero cometh. Hellboy is certainly more gung-ho than say Hancock but thats not saying much. Hes the average Joe of comic-book behemoths and in ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" he looks as if hed rather be kicking back than battling beasties.Despite its comic-book trappings - its based on the Dark Horse comic books created by Mike Mignola - ""Hellboy II"" even more so than its predecessor ""Hellboy"" resembles nothing so much as an art film phantasmagoria.This should not be surprising since the director of the series is Guillermo del Toro best known among cineastes for ""Pans Labyrinth"" a sinister fairy tale set in Fascist Spain that won the 2006 Oscar for best foreign film. Hes also noted for such high-style Hollywood bloodbaths as ""Blade II."" In other words hes an auteur who likes to have it both ways. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Hellboy II"" del Toro who co-scripted with Mignola attempts to weld the bam-pow studio mind-set to a more expressive artistic sensibility. The result is like ""Pans Labyrinth"" on steroids. This is not entirely intended as a compliment. For one thing ""Pans Labyrinth"" is a movie that for all its flavor doesnt hold up as a masterpiece. In retrospect it resembles a del Toro freak show amped up with sociopolitical smarts. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Hellboy II The Golden Army ""Hellboy II"" doesnt take itself nearly as seriously but like its predecessor overdoses on big galumphing goblins and trolls and creepy-crawlies. Since many of these uglies are inventively designed starting with Hellboy himself the film is far from a washout. But del Toro doesnt quite know when to call a halt to the pageant. Its been said that you dont know what is enough until you know what is more than enough. ""Hellboy II"" is more than enough.Ron Perlman once again plays Hellboy and his bulked-up physique the color of red clay is as imposing as ever. His girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) who has the convenient ability to turn herself into flame is pregnant by him - though she withholds the news for a long time. As bickering fun couples go these two dont exactly rival Tracy and Hepburn but Blairs caustic line deliveries are incongruously droll and Perlman sounding like George Clooney is amusingly gruff. His Hellboy is like a 1940s hard-boiled noir hero who somehow mutated into a crimson behemoth with a sledgehammer right fist and a long sinuous tail. Hes filed off his horns to play down his demonic origins and why not? Hellboy remember is the good guy.Not so his adversary Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) an albino-ish nasty who looks as if he might have stepped out of a David Bowie roadshow circa 1975. Nuada wants to restore the hegemony of the Golden Army an ancient sect that has been subdued for centuries by humans. Aiding Nuada in his nefariousness is Mr. Wink who looks like the offspring of King Kong and a giant trash compactor. Hes so gross hes likeable.Since Hellboy is working on behalf of humans to clean up this mess he finds himself conflicted at times about his status. Shouldnt he feel more at home among the Mr. Winks of the world? Fortunately del Toro doesnt mine this dilemma. This is not after all a movie that can bear much in the way of identity crises.Besides del Toros identity crisis is plenty for one movie. Hes trying to be a schlockmeister and a poet all at the same time. His imagery simultaneously draws on pulp kid stuff and Gustave Dore. Whatever its borrowings the fetid and feverish ""Hellboy II"" comes across as an original. But being original is not always the same thing as being wonderful.

Comments Hellboy II The Golden Army Recommended In Guillermo del Toros sequel to his Hellboy (2004) the big red guy (Ron Perlman) tries to thwart a renegade elfin prince (Luke Goss) who plans to violate a long-standing truce with mankind by resurrecting a dormant army of gigantic metal warriors. Del Toros previous film the complex visually arresting Pans Labyrinth (2006) demonstrated his growth as a filmmaker and though the themes here arent as profound the striking set design and use of nonhuman characters carry over culminating in a funny offbeat superhero flick. Based on the comic books by Mike Mignola; with Selma Blair as the heros combustible love interest Doug Jones as his sidekick and Jeffrey Tambor. PG-13 110 min.

The teeming Troll Market in the film exemplifies his approach an eye-ravishing spectacle that invests each monster with its own personality. Witness the cute infant who when soppily cooed over angrily retorts Im not a baby Im a tumour. Virtually a stand-alone film it pitches the red-skinned devil-horned Hellboy headlong into a mythical clash between his adopted human world and an ancient underworld of elves faeries and trolls. The plot in brief concerns the plans of usurped King Balors son Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) to awaken the dormant Golden Army pitiless clockwork uber-warriors commissioned and later mothballed by his horrified father. To prevent this the princes twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) - to whom he is telepathically linked - elicits the help of Hellboy his pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) aquatic empath Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and a newcomer to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense Johann Kraus an ectoplasmic mystic housed in a metal diving suit. Together they battle against the rebellious Prince seething swarms of Tooth Fairies towering troll henchman Wink and the terrifyingly beautiful Angel of Death.Perfectly cast Ron Perlman (below) plays Hellboy as an anti-superhero a blue-collar guy who is happier chugging beers and eating pizza than fighting evil. The fanboy indulgence of the spectacular action scenes sometimes arrests the plots forward momentum but what del Toro calls the bloodline of moral choice runs through the richly imagined story like a scarlet thread. Crucially no distinction is made between the humans the tame monsters of the BPRD and the glamorous freaks they are charged with policing. All are capable of the whole gamut of human emotions. A thinking persons creature feature graced with two contrasting love stories - Abe Sapien falls for the pale and interesting princess; Hellboys hesitant girlfriend Liz is unable to tell him she is pregnant with his child - Hellboy II is also a heartfelt plea for bio- and cultural diversity.

Basically it takes all the visual splendour wild imaginative flights and fairytale creepiness of Pans Labyrinth ramps it up adds budget and bolts it to a story thats pure multiplex momentum as opposed to the dark slightly-too-clever artiness of PL.

"Marvellous Hellboy monsters need more gravity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMarvellous Hellboy monsters need more gravity Hellboy is back with a host of new and hideously imagined enemies the usual relationship trouble and the same old rock-em-sock-em action.Ron Perlman is back as kitten-loving superhero in Hellboy II The Golden Army.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. July 11 2008Starring Ron Perlman Selma Blair Jeffrey Tambor. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Hellboy is back with a host of new and hideously imagined enemies the usual relationship trouble and the same old rock-em-sock-em action.Plus theres a bundle of joy on the way. (This proves that despite his best efforts to keep them filed down Hellboy is at heart a horny devil.)Guillermo del Toro returns as director and screenwriter with the same dazzling visual style but with a story that marks a shift in tone one much less preachy (with barely a trace of his earnestly conventional Judeo-Christian ethics) and more focused on light comedy.Article Continued BelowThe story - co-conceived with Hellboy comic-book creator Mike Mignola - starts out at a military base in 1955 on Christmas Eve with Professor Broom (John Hurt who died in the first Hellboy doing a brief cameo here wearing a dark wig) telling his young charge a bedtime story to get him to sleep before Santa Claus arrives.It seems that a long time ago during a war between humankind and various non-humans (elves trolls etc.) an indestructible Golden Army of marauding metal behemoths was created by a blacksmithing goblin until a truce put them into deep storage underground.Appalled by humanitys greed Prince Nuada (played by Luke Goss) plots to unite the three pieces of a mythic crown to reawaken them while his twin sister Nuala (Anna Walton) sides with the A-team from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defence.In his search the prince with ill-tempered monster troll Mr. Wink in tow lays waste to an auction house full of hoity-toity clients using an army of cute but rapacious tooth fairies.The chase is on.Del Toros visual style continues to delight and amaze with mythical creations that leave creative minds like Star Wars creator George Lucas in the dust. His troll market for example is a fantasmorgical marvel.But Hellboy fans may find Del Toro a little too flippant in steering this franchise through its second journey. (There are hints that a third one is on the way).FBI agent John Myers - who duelled with Hellboy for Liz Shermans love in the first movie - is dismissively ""transferred"" to Antarctica at Hellboys request.""He said he likes the cold"" Hellboy notes wryly.Then Hellboy deliberately breaks the unwritten code of silence - despite a bribe of real Cuban cigars - unmasking himself and other team members to an astonished public. (Jimmy Kimmel has a brief funny cameo riffing on the revelation.)""All I want is to be is an ordinary person"" Hellboy tells a television reporter confessionally.But to what effect? Crowds who see Hellboy later fighting a giant tree monster (which starts out as a Mexican jumping bean - just add water) hurl insults and the occasional bit of garbage.An anguished mother grabs her baby out of his arms with not even a thank you.""Yeah I know Im ugly"" he retorts to an onlookers abuse.If this was meant to generate sympathy it goes nowhere.It would have been much more fun for Hellboy to remain the subject of blurry photos in tabloid magazines and various conspiracy theories. Then theres the addition to the team of Johann Krauss an ectoplasmic entity in a stylized deep-sea divers suit (a ghost in the machine as it were) whose accent isnt particularly amusing and whose contribution is negligible.Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) who was such an etherally bleary-eyed fire hazard in the first Hellboy is much more clear-eyed in this one and much less interesting as a result.There is Ron Perlmans wonderfully droll and occasionally poignant portrayal of the main character plenty of cute kitties some great action scenes a range of astonishing eye-pleasing visuals and some solid comic moments including a scene in which Hellboy and his aquatic pal Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) get drunk and karaoke to Barry Manilow.Still one cant help but wonder whether Del Toro hasnt misjudged the balance between comedy and gravity in this sequel.With twin Hell-brats on the way what can we expect from the next outing Hellboy III The Terrible Twos?

Whats the logic of that design? The logic is that the whole expensive movie was built in the image of Eddie Murphy a still-talented star who still commands kings ransoms to make comedies that still attract gleeful audiences no matter how arbitrary erratic perfunctory illogical ramshackle or grotesque those movies may be. And this new one is only some of the above -- dumbfoundingly erratic for the most part but smart and funny from time to time especially when Mr. Murphy in the pseudo-person of the spaceship tries to imitate earthling behavior. That means learning to walk the walk (though Vincent DOnofrio did a wilder version as a discombobulated alien in ""Men in Black""); talk the talk (calibrating the right pitch is as much of a problem as finding the right words) and eat the eats (meatloaf which the spaceships database confuses with the singer Meat Loaf then hot dogs 85 of which the spaceship consumes while posing as a contestant at a Manhattan street fair). Above all it means that the puppeteer orchestrating these behaviors -- the pompous pedantic captain inside the strutting machine -- must learn to navigate the bafflements of earthling emotions starting and ending with love. See a clip from the film ""Meet Dave."" Video courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox. If some of this sounds familiar its because ""Meet Dave"" is nothing if not derivative. (Brian Robbins directed from a script by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett.) You name it and the filmmakers have borrowed from it not only ""Men In Black"" but ""Mork and Mindy"" ""Fantastic Voyage"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (which Mr. Murphy is remaking) and ""Horton Hears a Who"" among others. (The spaceship wears a white suit because the aliens had intercepted an episode of ""Fantasy Island"" and figured everyone on earth wore white suits.) Elizabeth Banks plays an earthling who becomes the object of the captains love; shes likeable and attractive though awfully earnest. Gabrielle Union as the ships culture officer isnt earnest at all; shes dynamic and increasingly alluring as she like the captain and the rest of the crew takes on the most alien behaviors of the host planet. When certain members of the crew abandon ship for terra firma ""Meet Dave"" changes radically -- neither for the better nor worse since those terms dont really apply -- and the whole dramatic contraption self-destructs well before the end of its 90-minute running time. Yet the spectacle is seldom boring. Mega-budget grotesque is an art form of its own. See a clip from the film ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. Hellboy II The Golden Army If you didnt know that theres a Troll Market underneath the east tower of the Brooklyn Bridge you need to brush up on your monstrosities with the help of Guillermo del Toros hugely inventive -- and smashingly beautiful -- ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" Like the first Hellboy feature four years ago this film was based on Mike Mignolas Dark Horse comic and stars Ron Perlman as the red-faced cigar-puffing kitten-and-candy-loving working-class do-gooder who was born a demon but wants to fit in as a human. In that previous episode Hellboy battled a mad monk plus hordes of tentacled egg-laying creatures that had infested our society. Now hes our bulwark against an indestructible robot army that waits to be released from the bowels of the earth. While it waits (for quite a long time actually) Mr. del Toro and his lavishly gifted colleagues -- among them the cinematographer Guillermo Navarro the production designer Stephen Scott and the creatures-and-effects specialist Mike Elizalde -- trot out the most spectacular assortment of life forms since ""Star Wars"" opened its cantina. ""Hellboy II"" From Concept to Creation Indeed ""Hellboy II"" is best savored as a bestiary one that includes an eyeless Angel of Death a legless Bethmoora Goblin (whos a long way from Glocca Mora) and some extremely unpleasant Tooth Fairies -- their most prominent feature being their teeth -- who feed diabolically on calcium. The pace isnt always brisk; this film seems more dependent than its predecessor on set pieces. But the pieces are impressive and Hellboy is accompanied once again by Doug Joness aquatic empath Abe and Selma Blairs melancholy pyrokinetic Liz. She keeps trying with mixed results not to set herself on fire. Journey to the Center of the Earth ENLARGE Brendan Fraser Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem in Journey to the Center of the Earth. New Line Cinema Surprising as it may be given an unpromising trailer the 3D update of Jules Vernes ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" turns out to be perfectly charming as well as predictably eye-popping. 3D movies have an ironclad obligation to scare the audience with water squirted from hoses or tossed from buckets and this one observes the convention with a vengeance. (Watch out for spittle spit both by man and beast.) Beyond that though the illusion of depth enhances the imaginative treatment of an extremely simple story -- even simpler than the one in the much beloved 1959 version that starred James Mason and played out by a smaller cast. See a clip from the film ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Video courtesy of New Line Cinema. A cast of three principals to be precise Brendan Fraser as a scientist looking for traces of his vulcanologist brother who may have gone down a volcanic tube (the geological counterpart of Alices rabbit hole); Josh Hutcherson as his young nephew and Anita Briem as their Icelandic mountain guide. Mr. Fraser hits a silly symphony of right notes; hes lightly amused by the preposterous surroundings but never self-amused. And what surroundings they are giant dandelions that scatter their seeds all over the theater giant Venus fly traps magnetic rocks floating in a void mine shafts with roller-coaster tracks a bio-luminous bird that hovered like Tinker Bell over the row in front of mine. The film marks the auspicious directorial debut of a special effects expert named Eric Brevig. My only quarrel with his direction is that he didnt give Anita Briem enough to do. An Icelandic beauty who speaks English with a barely perceptible but enchanting lilt she has a few brisk dialogue scenes near the beginning after which her character is mainly in danger. In those early scenes though Ms. Briem reveals a vivid spirit and a gift for comedy. She needs to be seen much more prominently on the Earths surface. DVD TIP ENLARGE Guillermo del Toro is best known for ""Pans Labyrinth"" the dark and remarkable fantasy set in Spain during the civil war that won three Oscars last year. At least as remarkable and perhaps superior as an allegory of that war is his 2001 horror film ""The Devils Backbone."" The time is the late 1930s and the setting is a Spanish orphanage a place of shelter and learning thats haunted by more than standard spooks. The orphanage and its school are emblematic of civilized Spain menaced from within by fascist violence. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

"Hellboy II The Golden Armyreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Hellboy II The Golden Armyreviewed. Hellboy II The Golden Armyreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 10 2008 625 PM Youre Going to Hellboy Guillermo del Toros beastly good imagination. By Dana Stevens Hellboy II The Golden Army When people say that comic books are as close as our secular late-capitalist culture gets to having its own mythology its not generally meant as a compliment. But over the course of two Hellboy movies (based on the comic by Mike Mignola) Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has started to look like a legitimate successor to Ovid. Del Toro is not so much a creator of myths as a collector of them a transhistorical myth nerd whose pantheon of influences ranges from Hesiod to Harryhausen (with liberal helpings of steam punk and Catholic iconography). In Hellboy II The Golden Army (Universal) del Toro continues to develop his own private eschatology a vision of the end of the world dominated by motifs of meshing gear wheels dangling rosaries and the looming visage of a devil with sawed-off horns. The joke is that this crimson-faced demon is also a beer-swilling regular guy not to mention the universes only hope for salvation. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is known as ""Red"" to his friends who consist mainly of his fellow residents at the Jersey-based Bureau for Paranormal Research and Development. This top-secret facility houses such freaks of nature as Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) a water-dwelling fish/man with empathic powers and Hellboys girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) a pyro-kinetic woman who can burst into flames at will. These preternaturally gifted research subjects are smuggled out of the bureau to fight crimes by night--until the less-than-discreet Hellboy gives away the game by falling out a window into a crowd of waiting reporters. Advertisement Soon though the BPRD has bigger problems than a publicity leak. The underground prince Nuada (Luke Goss) has decided to assemble the long-defunct Golden Army an unstoppable platoon of mechanized warriors to take back Earth from humans. (This all has to do with a long-ago war explained in an inventive puppet sequence between men and the magical beings who once ruled the planet.) In order for Hellboy Liz and Abe to stop Nuada they must enter into a secret netherworld that exists just beneath our own In one scene the base of the Brooklyn Bridge serves as a portal to a ""troll market"" teeming with creatures straight out of Hieronymous Bosch. In another Hellboy battles a building-sized plantlike being thats so amorphous it seems to embody the self-regenerating power of nature. The eerie pathos of the plant-creatures eventual defeat reinforces Hellboy IIs ambiguous message Though Red and his pals are doing the right thing by teaming up to save humanity theyre also killing off some of the last of their own kind and thus adding to the endangered-species list of beautiful freaks. But despite this nostalgic tone Hellboy II is no pseudo-existential gloom fest. Perlmans Red is hilarious combining the gritty delivery of a film noir cop with the physiognomy of a horned behemoth. And the script by del Toro and Mignola alternates action smackdowns with sweet goofy moments like a scene in which Red and the lovelorn Abe drink beer and croon along with a Barry Manilow record. Unlike many action filmmakers del Toro doesnt thrill to the hardware of manmade technology weapons cars high-tech lab equipment. He prefers the soft organic textures of flesh and his trove of imaginary beasties (many of them created with a combination of CGI animation and puppetry that gives them an impressive sense of realness) is unmatched in modern fantasy filmmaking. In the feverishly beautiful fantasy Pans Labyrinth (2006) del Toro and his frequent collaborator actor/mime Doug Jones created the horrific ""Pale Man"" a nearly featureless wraith with eyeballs on the palms of his hands. Believe me Pale Man looks like your mailman compared with some of the weirdos on parade in Hellboy II. One of del Toros upcoming projects is to direct two films based on J.R.R. Tolkiens The Hobbit executive-produced by Peter Jackson. Peopling Middle Earth with creatures like Smaug the Dreadful and the Great Spiders of Mirkwood may be del Toros best chance yet to let his freak flag fly. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Starring Ron Perlman Doug Jones Jeffrey Tambor and Selma Blair. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""God I hate YouTube"" a government figure exclaims just a few minutes into ""Hellboy 2 The Golden Army"" after a top-secret mission is caught on video. It might as well be Guillermo del Toro talking. The ""Pans Labyrinth"" director appears to despise the 21st century filling his latest movie with an all-you-can-eat buffet of puppets stop-motion animation and actors who spent six hours in a makeup chair just to get into character. And where other summer movie soundtracks showcase whatever the kids might be listening to these days del Toros picture features Vivaldi and Barry Manilow. The talented fantasy filmmaker and heir to the ""Lord of the Rings"" throne gets the tone right throughout ""Hellboy 2"" and the hip retro charm alone is enough to merit recommendation. There arent many directors who can pay homage to both ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Ghostbusters"" and not end up with a complete mess. But the movie also reaches a point where the plot emotional impact and even some of the performances are sacrificed to the clutter of the directors vision. After nearly two hours theres only so much awesome creature design a viewer can take. Remember the three or four creepy-awesome beasts that were scattered throughout ""Pans Labyrinth""? There are trolls and machine-men and homicidal flying bug-fairies just like them in ""Hellboy 2"" except multiplied by 100. Its as if del Toro and ""Hellboy 2"" creature designer Mike Elizalde opened up every sketchbook they had doodled in since junior high unleashing all the monsters of their collective imaginations into one film. Creatures that appear onscreen here for a second or two rummaging through trash in the background could support an entire movie on the Sci-Fi Network. Based on the look of his latest film del Toro seems like a wise choice to direct the ""Hobbit"" movies. ""Hellboy 2"" based on the Mike Mignola comic book series expands on the quirky-cool nature of the first film in which a group of superhuman mutations screw around in the dormlike confines of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense - less like the X-Men and more like Booger and Wormser ruling the Tri-Lam house in ""Revenge of the Nerds."" Theres no panty raid in ""Hellboy 2"" but the residents do get drunk and haze their by-the-book supervisor played by professional victim Jeffrey Tambor. The action begins in flashback with a young Hellboy listening to a story told by his surrogate father (John Hurt) about a race of elf-men who built an army of golden robot juggernauts to conquer humankind but were locked up before they could get the job done. In the present a renegade elf prince decides he wants to unleash this force to punish man for his careless destruction of Earths resources. (OK we get it. We all need to recycle more. Could we have just one summer popcorn movie that doesnt guilt us for not being green enough?) As Prince Nuada del Toro favorite Luke Goss is an excellent-looking villain. He executes spin-kicks and handles his magical spear-dagger like a Hong Kong action movie star and his hulking sidekick has an awesome metal hand that fires like a cannon then retracts into his arm with a giant chain. Did we mention that 12-year-old boys are really going to love this film? Theres a huge battle approximately every 10 minutes in ""Hellboy 2"" so its a credit to screenwriter-director del Toro that he fits in as much exposition as he does. Ron Perlman and Selma Blair still have chemistry as Hellboy and his fire-starter girlfriend Liz and fish-man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones once again buried in prosthetic makeup) gets his own love interest. But the attempt to explore humankinds love-hate relationship with Hellboy seems incomplete and unoriginal the rare superhero movie cliche in a film that tries so hard not to fall into modern plot traps. The scene in which Hellboy and Abe share a beer and listen to ""Cant Smile Without You"" is also problematic considering that romance in this franchise will always take third billing behind the epic explosions and homicidal mini-creatures attaching themselves to human faces. (Suit-wearing BPRD agents are to ""Hellboy 2"" what the away-team officer in a red tunic was to the first ""Star Trek"" television series.) By the time the Golden Army arrives theres no time left to explore anything except maximum mechanical destruction. Even in the action-movie-filled middle of the summer del Toros imagination run amok is a lot for even the geekiest moviegoer to take in one sitting. -- Advisory This film contains violence strong language and Barry Manilow. Selma Blair stalkers should also be warned that the actress doesnt even strip down to a tank top in this picture. (If you havent already rent ""Feast of Love."" It doesnt have any kung fu-fighting elves but Blair does get naked.)

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Comic Books Movies Entertainment News Theres a minor character in Guillermo del Toros ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" who wears a kings robes and a crown that resembles the spires and turrets of a European fairy-tale city. Except its not a crown -- this skyline of towers and curving walls springs directly from his head. Explaining the characters conception in an online New York Times feature del Toro said this regal creature -- who came to be known as ""Cathedral Head"" -- was ""somebody that instead of thinking about his home city he kind of carried it around."" Del Toro himself is a kind of Cathedral Head a filmmaker whose strong sense of place -- whose sense of preserving the notion of a personal if not literal home -- has been the foundation of pictures like the extraordinary post-Spanish Civil War fairy tale ""Pans Labyrinth"" and its precursor ""The Devils Backbone"" as well as the two ""Hellboy"" movies. That the 2004 ""Hellboy"" and now ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" are both mainstream pictures based on comic books (created by writer-artist Mike Mignola) and not ""small"" pictures initially designated for the art house doesnt diminish the scope of del Toros vision. The bald truth is that del Toro is one of the few young filmmakers working in the mainstream who actually has any vision as opposed to just a knack for dreaming up cool effects. ""Hellboy II"" -- poetic funny darkly romantic and beautifully structured -- is a very different picture from ""Pans Labyrinth."" But theres no doubt that it springs from the same cathedral. Hellboy for the uninitiated is a strapping demon with red skin and a right hand and forearm that resembles a block of concrete. (As an infant during World War II he was rescued from a remote Scottish isle and raised by his adoptive father professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm played here as in the first movie by John Hurt.) Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a swaggering wiseacre presence in a duster raincoat He works for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (which happens to be in New Jersey) and along with a band of fellow misfits fights evil wherever it rears its ugly head. Hellboy is a misunderstood beastie and average citizens dont know what to make of him His looks scare people and his inability to tolerate idiots makes him cantankerous. But even though he comes off as something of a roughneck a cigar-smoking beer-guzzling TV-watching guy whos always spoiling for a fight hes at heart a tremendous softie as evidenced by the throngs of affectionate kittens who swarm around his feet when hes relaxing at home in Bureau headquarters. Hellboys closest friends the only ""people"" who really understand him are his colleagues at the Bureau including his girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) a mite half his size who has the ability to start fires spontaneously with her fingertips and the elegant well-read aquatic creature Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) who has the gills of a fish and the soul of John Donne. Del Toro -- who wrote the story and script working from Mignolas material -- opens ""Hellboy II"" with a back story in the form of a mythological bedtime tale that Trevor in a flashback sequence reads to the young Hellboy (Montse Ribe) about a king (played by veteran English character actor Roy Dotrice) who in the fight for dominance between the elf world and the human one assembles a ""golden army"" of superwarriors. But these troops cause nothing but more heartache and destruction. The king repents declaring a truce between the two worlds and disbanding the army by literally breaking up his crown and scattering the segments. His power-hungry son Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) a malcontent in an Edgar Winter hairdo slinks away from the scene in disgust only to reemerge in the modern day with a plan to reassemble the army and thus take control of the human world. You can imagine what Hellboy thinks of that plan once he gets wind of it. The biggest complication is that Nuada has a twin Princess Nuala (played by Anna Walton in a performance thats both serene and vampish). Its not clear at first where Nualas sympathies lie. But she is connected to her twin by supernatural bonds When he bleeds she bleeds too. Nuada and his henchman Wink (Brian Steele) a giant scaly creature with a right hand thats something like a retractable mace (a parallel to Hellboys own ""deformity"") unleash an assortment of ills upon the world beginning with boxes full of small skittering creepy-crawlies who wreak havoc at a Manhattan auction house. (Theyre called ""tooth fairies"" and you dont want to know what their deal is.) Del Toro works confidently on both the small scale and the bigger canvas. Minute details are important He originally wanted to have little people living inside Cathedral Heads towers and ramparts. (When he realized what the movies budget was he told the Times ""the people suddenly left the city."") But theres also something intimate about his large-scale creature creations which include a hungry beanstalk with a pointed impassive masklike green face whose dual purpose is to give life and take it away. Everything -- not just everyone -- in ""Hellboy II"" has a discernible personality that emerges through his her or its movements within the frame or simply from the movies vivid visuals. (The cinematographer is del Toros frequent collaborator Guillermo Navarro; the production design is by Stephen Scott.) You Might Also Like Theres so much to look at in ""Hellboy II"" -- so many weird beings with crepelike skin or eyes in all the wrong places -- that the picture runs the risk of being excessive. But in the end its grandness works because its so well balanced by the expressions on the actors faces (even when those faces are laden with latex and makeup) or by offbeat little touches like the troupe of cats who cautiously emerge from beneath Hellboys bed after he and Liz have had a particularly noisy dust-up. I confess Ive come to dread movies in which the hero faces down an ""army"" of anything Elaborate battles are now a staple of fantasy movies and the big CGI showdowns of the ""Lord of the Rings"" pictures set a standard that everyone is now trying to top. But bigger isnt necessarily better -- in fact it seldom is. Even del Toro seems to realize that and he constructs the climactic battle sequence so that it caps off everything in the story thats come before -- the movie ends with an emphatic (if somewhat open-ended) period instead of three exclamation marks. And as with the first ""Hellboy"" del Toro is most interested in using fantasy to explore the humanity of his decidedly nonhuman characters. There are some new ones including Johann Krauss (his voice belongs to Seth MacFarlane) a walking suit of armor that serves as a container for a personality which is essentially an ectoplasmic vapor. (The fact that Krauss is German gives Hellboy who was rescued from the Nazis as an infant no end of wisecrack material -- although his prejudices arent permanent.) Theres some domestic strife between Liz and Hellboy who strive to do good in the world even as theyre finding it difficult do right by each other. Blair and Perlman have a lovely prickly give-and-take here Their recurring annoyance with each other is part of the electricity of their love. And in ""Hellboy II"" del Toro has created an expanded role for the wonderful Doug Jones as Abe Sapien. (In ""Hellboy"" David Hyde-Pierce was the voice of Abe but Hyde-Pierce realized that Jones was so completely responsible for the shaping of the character that magnanimously he withdrew his name from the credits. In ""Hellboy II"" the voice we hear belongs to Jones.) It was only a matter of time before a deeply romantic creature like Abe fell in love and in ""Hellboy II"" he does. As he explains to Hellboy in his most lovesick moment ""Shes like me -- a creature from another world"" a simple way of explaining how wonderful it feels to be connected to someone when youve spent your life feeling isolated. Special effects have so radically taken over the content of mainstream movies -- particularly summer blockbusters -- that theyve reached the point of being nothing special at all. Were still seeing more action movies that use special effects to beat the audience into a state of something resembling awe (as ""The Incredible Hulk"" did) than ones that put the focus on live performers using special effects judiciously and with some sense of how they need to serve a story and its characters (a la ""Iron Man""). But Guillermo del Toros ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" is something else again Its too wildly fanciful too witty too operatic in its vision to fit comfortably into any of the convenient folders we might use to keep our mainstream entertainments sorted in our minds. I left the theater so enraptured so energized that it didnt immediately register that Id just seen a ""special-effects"" movie although of course I had. The alien-looking eyes of Jones Abe Sapien are difficult to read by themselves. And so Jones expresses his characters deepest fears and longings just by blinking or by a subtle inclination of his blue-striped almond-shaped head. These delicate precise movements are also special effects small curlicues in the movies grand design and del Toros boldness lies in the fact that he sees their value as part of the magnificent whole. Unfazed by the noisy Hollywood industry around him del Toro always carries his home city in his head. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"Hellboy II The Golden Army | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hellboy-ii-the-golden-army ) Hellboy II The Golden Army (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The temptation is to remark that if Hellboy was the appetizer then Hellboy II The Golden Army is the main course. To an extent thats true. The second film is more assured better paced and has a stronger emotional component. It takes chances offers action pathos and humor provides a Barry Manilow singalong and keeps the focus where it should be on Hellboy. For all that it does well however Hellboy II stumbles at the end with two logic-defying plot holes that are so obvious its inconceivable no one caught them or provided explanations. (Maybe theres some crucial information on the cutting room.) These flaws minor as they might seem damage the story and degrade the overall experience. Exhilaration gives way to a modicum of frustration. Hellboy II assumes but does not demand that viewers have seen its predecessor. Little in the way of background is provided on the character and his compatriots - a group of freaks working for the U.S. government in a secret FBI installation. (In Hellboy II its located in Trenton N.J. In Hellboy it was in Newark. Whats a few dozen miles between bastions of urban blight?) With the main human from the first movie removed from the action Hellboy II turns its focus on the ""family"" of misfits occupying the ultra-secret installation. Theres Red (Ron Perlman) the guy with the Incredible Hulk chest Wolverines penchant for smoking cigars and cracking wise and a softer-than-soft spot in his heart for his beloved Liz (Selma Blair). At first blush she appears to be human until she flames on and transforms herself into a living breathing conflagration. Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) is a smart amphibian a cool Blue to Hellboys hot Red. Finally theres newcomer Johann Kraus (James Donn) an ""ectoplasmic"" gas bag whos all smoke and mirrors. The villain this time around is the elf Prince Nuada (Luke Gross) who seeks to recover the three pieces of a crown that once assembled will give him ultimate control over the Golden Army - hundreds of unstoppable indestructible warriors who can wage war against the hoards of humanity. Nuadas Achilles heel is his twin sister Nuala (Anna Walton) who opposes his worldview. She and her piece of the crown fall under the protection of Hellboy and his friends but none of them are prepared for the vengeance with which Nuada comes at them. Hellboy IIs story is more of a fantasy adventure than it is a straightforward superhero yarn. Visually and creatively it is as much a close cousin to writer/director Guillermo del Toros Pans Labyrinth as it is to its cinematic predecessor. Seeing the trolls goblins elves and elementals come to life its not hard to see why Peter Jackson hand-picked del Toro to helm The Hobbit. One of the films stand-out sequences a visit to the ""Trolls Market"" recalls not only Luke Skywalkers venture into the cantina but Harry Potters first visit to Diagon Alley. Of course Red is a little better equipped to defend himself than Luke or Harry. The portrayals of the characters are note-perfect. Perlman ""got"" Red in the first film so all he has to do is continue in the same vein. Selma Blairs Liz however is transformed from a skittish closed-off woman to a confident self-aware heroine. Doug Jones crafts Abe into more than a fish-man in a tank. The newcomers are all excellent especially the elf twins whose destinies in opposition open an artery of tragedy. Then theres Jeffrey Tambor once again playing the officious head of the group a paper-pusher who understands little and is in control of less. As an action director del Toro has advanced considerably since the previous feature. Many of the fights in Hellboy seemed obligatory. Here theyre full-blown kick-ass tournaments. The battle royale near the end is impressive especially when Hellboy realizes whats happening and punctuates it with a characteristic ""Crap"" All of the characters get a chance to shine whether its Liz frying an army of tooth fairies Abe defending Nuala with little more than his intellect and firm resolve or Johann taking over a row of lockers. Of course Hellboy is all over the place smashing things getting pummeled and ultimately showing that hes not as indestructible as he looks. Hellboy II takes an opportunity to hint at a future storyline with a prophecy the likes of which were accustomed to encountering in fantasy epics. Clearly the view is for Hellboy to become an enduring evolving franchise - which is what superhero tales need to avoid the pitfall of becoming static and repetitive. The Superman films of the 80s and the Batman films of the 90s fell victim to this; del Toro wants something different for Big Red. From a plotting perspective the film makes two large missteps during its denouement. Polished screenplays shouldnt have such readily identifiable flaws which makes me wonder whether something important was deleted from the finished cut. (Click here for an explicit discussion. Beware there are spoilers.) Its hard to ignore such issues; they damage the integrity of the ending and that in turn makes the movie less special. Hellboy II is solid entertainment but its a shame such blemishes prevent it from achieving a higher level.

If it werent for all the supernatural monsters that need slaying hed probably be just as happy to work at Jiffy Lube. But in ""Hellboy II"" the big red lug must contend with goblins elf kings trolls and Jeffrey Tambor. Theres an all-powerful plant god the size of a battleship - Podzilla? - that could cancel out the planets carbon emissions. Theres an oracle with 100 eyes on his wings and a fussy fish-man who looks like the love child of C-3PO and Charlie the Tuna. PHOTO GALLERY Hellboy II With the exception of Tambor these creatures are done up in slithery style with writhing tentacles and misshapen faces. If I were a kid this movies images would light up my nightmares. To its credit Guillermo del Toros more extravagant 75 million follow-up to his 2004 B-movie doesnt take any of this particularly seriously. Its a monster movie in which the monsters listen to Barry Manilow. (Note to Hollywood You could do a lot with this idea.) Hellboy (Ron Perlman) emerged from the Earths inflamed bowels during a Nazi WWII mission to find supernatural stuff. Hes a wise- and skull-cracking red devil on a mission to stop an elf prince who looks like Legolas crazy uncle. His catchphrase needs a makeover though; a desultory ""Aw crap"" seems the best he can come up with. The bad elf wants to put together the dispersed pieces of an ancient crown and in so doing summon the buried Golden Army of killbots from their cellar somewhere under Northern Ireland which is as good a place as any to resume ancient feuds. The elf prince argues that his race deserves to take over the Earth because the humans have wasted their chance - ""Parking lots Shopping malls"" he cries. Aw crap Its bad enough this guy wants to summon a supernatural army that will make him the new master of the human race. Does he also have to guilt-trip me out of driving to Target this weekend? I really need that pack of gum. (Hellboys creator Mike Mignola who shares a story credit on the film has said there is an allegory about the American Indians here but going to this movie for the politics is like going to Hooters for the creme brulee.) Hellboy and his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) who has a habit of bursting into flame go after the prince. Theyre joined by their colleague from Team Paranomal the Vivaldi-loving fishman Abe Sapien and a new character a punctilious German (arent they all?) who is a waft of vapor bottled up in a diving suit. The German Krauss is given a vaudeville comic voice by a cheerful Seth MacFarlane the ""Family Guy"" creator. Its possible that signing a 100 million contract will lighten your mood but whatever the cause of the fun its catching. When Krauss and Hellboy argue with each other its like Dr. Strangelove and Buck Turgidson lost on a camping trip together. On to the fights. There are many of them frequently dusted with comedy and they keep things ripping along. The elf prince with much flit-twit-twitting of swords and spears that he spins like a baton twirler rips through an elf honor guard. The gang of good guys faces some ill-tempered ""tooth fairies"" the size of Chihuahuas who instead of leaving a dollar under your pillow eat your flesh like flying piranhas. Despite all of the hideous critters Hellboy encounters though there is a hint that things are considerably weirder elsewhere. When one beast cant be found at the troll market someone suggests looking for it in some far scarier place ""Over in Jersey maybe."" HELLBOY II THE GOLDEN ARMY Monster mash. Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence).

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 11 2008 1107 AM In 2004 Guillermo del Toros ""Hellboy"" repeatedly asked ""What is it that makes a man a man?"" In this terrific followup del Toro aims to find the answer.Originally created as a comic book character Hellboy isnt a man in the typical sense of the word what with the red skin horns and tail. But as played so perfectly by Ron Perlman hes not really that different from any other guy going through an early midlife crisis. A reluctant hero who makes Will Smiths Hancock look like a cub scout Hellboy - also known as HB - is no better off than he was in the first film. Technically a demon meant to destroy the Earth he has found another calling by fighting evil for the government. Hes still hiding out at a secret agency for paranormal research and he still feels like an unwanted freak. Hes finally living with girlfriend Liz (a stiff Selma Blair) but it doesnt take much to spark her fiery temper these days. What HB needs is a little love and he decides to get it by going public. Its not long before he has his chance the Underworlds Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is determined to annihilate mankind and plans to enlist an army of mechanical soldiers for help. Its up to Hellboy and his cohorts - including bureaucrat Tom (Jeffrey Tambor) aquatic mutant Abe (Doug Jones) and disembodied psychic Kraus (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) - to stop him. Unfortunately nothing is ever easy for HB and as soon as he steps outside the masses are less impressed than appalled. They dont see him as the man he has tried to become but as the demon he was born to be. Sensing that Hellboy is perpetually caught between two worlds Prince Nuada tries to pull him back to the dark side. Its HBs unique challenge - beer-drinking cigar-chomping pessimist that he is - to find reasons to remain in the light. The endlessly inventive del Toro creates visual fantasies unlike any other and the creatures on display here are truly extraordinary. But amid all the costumes all the action and all the special effects its the humanity that makes his work so memorable. Yes the monsters are amazing. But the moment when a heartsick Hellboy discovers Barry Manilow? Priceless. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

What saves us from a sense of oversaturation is the style and sensibility each film brings to the old formula of heroic angst exploding gas stations and fiendish enemies. The ""Hellboy"" films with their amiable grouch of a hero baroque visual excess and goofball humor take their responsibility to entertain us seriously but nothing else. They are comic-book movies with the fun put back in. And they are made by a fanboy of genius who can communicate a sense of childish wonderment Mexican auteur Guillermo Del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth""). Its the biggest richest most imaginative superhero movie of the summer and yes you can take that line for the poster Universal. Hellboy for those unfamiliar with his origins is a crimson horned demon discovered by Allied forces at the end of World War II. Lovingly raised by a kindly scientist (John Hurt seen here in a fleeting cameo) he has grown from a candy-and-TV-loving imp to a big bruiser (Ron Perlman performing capably under layers of latex) assigned to protect mankind from supernatural invaders. Hes a bit self-conscious about his horns grinding them down to hockey-puck stumps on his forehead as if that made a towering red secret agent with an oversized stone right hand any less conspicuous. Like the Men in Black Hellboy and his fellow strangelings at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense are supposed to operate under the publics radar. But Hellboy instinctively opposed to authority poses for snapshots and mugs on home videos. ""I hate YouTube"" groans his much-abused FBI handler Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor). There are bigger headaches on the horizon however. A chalk-skinned prince of the underworld (Luke Goss) is about to break an ancient truce between the old gods and humankind sending the legendary Golden Army of mechanical warriors into battle against the mortals. As if thats not enough Hellboy and his neurotic firestarter squeeze Liz (Selma Blair) are having heated arguments. Literally. His aquatic pal Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) experiences the pangs of first love with the princes twin sister (Anna Walton) who plays a crucial role in her siblings quest for power. Blah blah blah. Youve heard it all before in one form or another. The delight of the ""Hellboy"" films is that they play the clash-of-titans story line seriously enough to keep us on edge while surprising us with extravagantly cool images gratuitous moments of wonder and smartass humor. HELLBOY II THE GOLDEN ARMY  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some language. The creatures that populate Del Toros imagination are astoundingly lifelike and diverse enough to have originated in other dimensions. At the small end of the scale are the Tooth Fairies cute little pixies that can strip a human carcass clean in minutes. At the other end theres Wink a cross between a WWE wrestler and a water buffalo with a nifty mace-and-chain contraption in place of his right fist. In between is a menagerie of goblins banshees and jabberwockies that make the ""Star Wars"" Tattooine saloon look like the Dubuque Greyhound depot. The film aims higher than just tickling comic-book collectors though. There are passages of awe-inspiring grace here too. A showdown between Hellboy and a plant giant is chock full of the requisite thrills with buckled pavement smashed cars and screaming throngs. Del Toro gives it an unexpected poignancy as Hellboy cradling an endangered infant in his paw takes aim at the menace with his free hand. If he kills the weird being its race will be extinct. He weighs the decision for a few thought-provoking moments then resolves it in a gesture of breathtaking unexpected loveliness. Similarly the movie colors outside the traditional comic-book lines with its sense of humor. The comic relief in the films is the contrast between the paranormal agents apocalyptic work life and their humdrum personal concerns. Hellboy and Abe utterly stumped by the women in their lives slug back several cases of Mexicos Tecate beer (even the product placement here is witty). Then they proceed to belt out a Barry Manilow tune in honor of their baffling lady loves. Chorus after chorus after chorus. It does nothing to maintain the momentum or advance the story but its one of the most endearing character moments in ages. The same light touch extends to the films vocal casting. Those with sensitive ears may detect that its ""Family Guys"" Seth MacFarlane speaking the part of an ectoplasmic German agent who joins Hellboys team. If theres a criticism to be leveled here its that Del Toro is reaching too far in every scene trying to add more layers and ideas and dimensions to an already hectic story. But since most of it succeeds so well whos complaining? ""Hellboy"" is one hell of a ride.

"Hellboy II The Golden Army (PG-13) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Hellboy II The Golden Army (PG-13) 1/2 Give the devil his due -- these monsters rock. Ron Perlman is shown in a scene from ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"". Photo Egon Endrenyi. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The title of Hellboy II The Golden Army makes the movie sound like something intended primarily for people who saw the first Hellboy movie -- which was OK but not exactly memorable -- and can get excited about another one. Its a dry mundane title. Its also the only thing about the film that doesnt blow your mind right out of its comfortable Ive-seen-all-this-before rut. Nominally the film belongs to the swelling genre of comic-book superhero adaptations Its based on the character invented by Mike Mignola in the pages of Dark Horse comics a red-skinned demon spawned to destroy mankind who wound up working for the FBI to save it instead. But Hellboy II is more a work of pure awe-inspiring fantasy than a superhero picture. It is also a completely self-contained sequel easy to follow and utterly captivating even for those who never saw the first film. A thriving imagination is all the movie requires. This is a much more personal work for director Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth The Devils Backbone) who co-wrote the screenplay with Mignola. Where the first film four years ago felt like del Toro melding his sensibilities to Mignolas material Hellboy II makes Mignola come to del Toro. The movie is overrun with trolls and monsters and giant creatures made of boulders and winged fairies who look sort of cute until they get hungry and hunt the only thing they eat which is bone (they like to get your teeth first). The whole of Hellboy II is reminiscent of the fantasy sequences in Pans Labyrinth such as the one in which a little girl encountered the carnivorous Pale Man who had eyeballs in the palms of his hands. The movie has the aura of a fairy tale made up by someone with a fondness for the macabre and the sinister -- and the beautiful too. Hellboy II is constantly awing you with its worlds-within-worlds and the creatures that inhabit them such as a troll marketplace tucked away beneath the Brooklyn Bridge so dense with otherwordly creatures it trumps the Mos Eisley cantina sequence from Star Wars. Unlike so many other films of its genre Hellboy II doesnt require any heavy lifting in order to disappear into its world or keep track of whos who. Del Toro has a feather-light approach to fantasy He knows the fun immediately seeps out of a movie when it becomes work and his imagination is so endless and his creativity so resourceful that he makes Lucas and Spielberg seem like plodding old men. Compare the fist fight between Hellboy and the oversized goblin monster in The Golden Army with anything in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and tell me which of these two movies deserves to have grossed 300 million. The plot of The Golden Army sends Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his gang of equally colorful outcasts -- including his human-torch girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) and the half-man half-fish psychic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) -- on the trail of the elven prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who is piecing together an artifact to awaken the titular army of unstoppable warriors laying dormant deep inside the Earth. This may sound Lord of the Ring-ish complicated but it really isnt. The plot is merely a framework on which del Toro can hang one fabulous setpiece after another each one advancing the narrative just enough to not seem superfluous. A subplot in which Liz decides whether to tell Hellboy shes pregnant with his child becomes a visual motif in the film such as Hellboys cradling of an infant in his arms during his fight with a gigantic forest monster. Befitting most movies about superheroes theres never any question in Hellboy II whether the bad guys will win or lose. Its the path del Toro takes to get there that gives the film its propulsive kick You literally never know whats coming next and what does is always better and cooler than you could have imagined. Because of its genre The Golden Army wont get as many accolades as Pans Labyrinth but its every bit as transporting and entertaining only not quite as serious and a lot more playful. Its summer you know? Get ready to be very happy.

Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his pals must battle an imaginative array of creatures in Hellboy II The Golden Army. Photo Universal Pictures Hellboy II The Golden Army 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Hitchcocks mommy fixation or no we musnt read too much psychobabble into a directors work. But do you suppose Guillermo del Toro was traumatized by fairy tales as a kid? Check out his last movie Pans Labyrinth which crawled through a hidey-hole in a childs bedroom and discovered a ghoul with eyes in his hands. And check out his latest Hellboy II The Golden Army a sequel to his own strange sweet comic-book movie about a demon spawn rescued from the Nazis who grows up and saws off his telltale horns determined to join humanity as a force for good. This new movie melds the original Hellboys kibitzy humor and crushing action with Labyrinths darkest fairy-tale imaginings pitting the large red fellow against the ambitious elf prince Nuada (Luke Goss) and his ghoulish minions. Nuadas father long ago forged a truce between magical beings and their human enemies -- beings you get the countryside; people you get the towns -- but Nuada is peeved about mankinds abuse of the natural world and wants to crush us into submission. Parking lots especially vex him. The plan to reassemble an enchanted crown and rouse the long-slumbering army of the title. The opposition Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his pals at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense which includes his spontaneously combusting lover Liz (Selma Blair); the elegant fish-man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones); and a newcomer the noncorporeal Johann Krauss (the voice of Seth MacFarlane or maybe Colonel Klink) who consists of wufty vapor contained in an old diving suit and is I must say quite a guy. He has both a commanding way with ectoplasm and a snappily articulated fondness for order which he vents in such lines as ""Vat haff you done Agent Hellboy?"" and ""I now haff total control of its limbic system"" The limbic system belongs to a tooth fairy a nasty six-legged thing with an insatiable hunger for calcium. Its just one of many Labyrinth-ine bogeymen prowling under the floorboards of del Toros florid imagination. While cracking jokes and fighting evil Hellboy II is also a monstrously beautiful chamber of horrors. We see small chattering beasts with two rabbitlike heads apiece; we see an ashen soothsayer with eyes on her wings; we see a smoosh-faced troll who eats kittens but fears canaries; we see a creature with a wooden head carved into elaborate castle spires; we see a pinched old man with a talkative growth on his chest (""Im not a baby Im a tumor""); and most extraordinary of all we see a bean that lands in the sewer and expands like some fantastical sponge toy into a writhing green forest god the size of Kong. When it dies it coats the streets of New York with moss. Even this exquisite menagerie wears thin after a while becoming a feature-length Star Wars cantina scene of artfully rendered freaks. Sprung from Mike Mignolas original characters the Hellboy franchise shares obvious similarities with the superheroic misfits of X-Men or Fantastic Four but its hell-spawn origin story gives it an edge of supernatural danger. Yes ""Red"" likes beer and Cuban cigars and the word ""crap"" and yes he can belt out Barry Manilow with a drunken Abe (great scene). But hes still a devil; he still has that long swinging tail. And he still has issues to work out as the last reel of Hellboy II points to a sequel. As for del Toros issues theyre laid right out for us in the films opening flashback to 1955 as the little devils adoptive dad (John Hurt) reads him a certain fairy tale about a prince and a golden army. ""But its just a story -- right Pops?"" ""Is it now?"" comes the reply but that isnt really Pops talking. Its del Toro for whom nothing is ever ""just"" a story. Not in the mind of a child especially one who never grew up. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals The Mel Brooks Collection on Blu-ray for 25 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 11 2008 1202AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Mar. 31 2009 816PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Guillermo del Toro Written by Guillermo del Toro and Mike Mignola Starring Ron Perlmanand Selma Blair Classification 14A As a sensational stylist for monsters and demons an imaginative set designer and a sometimes interesting director Guillermo del Toro always gives you something to look at in his films. Hellboy 2 features a parade of ghastly creatures swarms of insect-like adversaries large and small spinning martial-arts battles and an all-you-can-gape buffet of bizarre props and hideous costumes. At his most provocative del Toro combines childlike fantasy and adult anti-fascist allegory in such films as The Devils Backbone and then Pans Labyrinth which remains his creative high point. Hellboy represents his commercial side - its a thought-free playground for the directors biomorphic props costumes and lurid effects. This is the second of del Toros films featuring the cigar-chomping wise-cracking demon (Ron Perlman) and an array of supernatural allies and villains. The opening half-hour of Hellboy 2 is the equivalent of a fancy dress ball for monsters There are drooping-pizza-dough faces teeth like broken pale fences and globular eyes of creatures you associate with deep ocean vents. Like a lot of well-staged parties though the affair peaks shortly after the introductions and then devolves into intrigues fights and mayhem. Del Toro and his co-scripter Mike Mignola who created the Hellboy comics provide enough background for the uninitiated. Hellboy the product of a Nazi occult experiment was raised by kindly Professor Broom (John Hurt) under the eyes of American paranormal researchers. We meet the young demon at Christmas 1955 when the professor tells him a creepy bedtime story. Way back in the day all the mythological creatures (elves goblins) used a mechanical army to wage a devastating war against humans. After the truce the elf king put his mechanical Golden Army into storage. Okay so technically its less of a bedtime story than a background exposition. Jump forward to the adult Hellboy known as Red to his friends because of his boiled-lobster complexion who is working as a paranormal investigator for the U.S. government. His colleagues include his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) who tends to catch fire when shes angry and the nerdy fish-headed Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). Theyre all supervised by the smarmy Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor). The interplay between the four actors is fractious and funny and before things start blowing up Hellboy 2 looks like the most promising creature comedy since Monsters Inc. The trouble begins when Hellboy and his cronies are sent to investigate an auction-house massacre. The slaughter and the carnivorous insects that have cleaned up are the work of Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) the heir to the elf throne. He wants to reclaim his fathers crown and unleash the Golden Army to take over the world. His twin sister Nuala (Anna Walton) sides with the humans. With their cracked pancake makeup and blond tresses the pair look like albino Goth rockers. And frankly compared with the other fabulous creatures in the film - the walrus-headed gorilla a German gas monster called Krauss the Angel of Death with eyes on her wings - the siblings are pretty trite. Youd think the writers could come up with something more original than a resentful vampire-like prince summoning his dark forces to destroy humanity. Hellboy 2 peaks as a domestic comedy when Hellboy and Abe struggle with their romantic woes get drunk and sing along to Barry Manilow (is it possible to get that loaded?). Perlman gives the character the bristling swagger of a man born to wear a plastic muscle suit and stumps of horns on his balding pate. Unfortunately the ultimate smackdown between good and evil - in an underground bunker in Northern Ireland - is a big letdown. Without giving too much away lets just say the Golden Army which looks like a set of multi-tubed espresso machines doesnt deserve its name in the title. Though Prince Nuada keeps intoning that there are ""70 times 70"" of them that amounts to a paltry 4900 more of a demonic coffee klatsch than an evil horde. Hellboy a sensitive devil with a tough exterior is an inspired creation but limited as a dramatic protagonist. When you start with a demon hero you cant settle for making his adversary a less complex demon. To create conflict you need an opponent who is not just powerful but also imposingly self-righteous.

The demon was nicknamed Hellboy. The moniker stuck and Broom raised the youngster to work against his own destiny That oversized fist is a key to unlock the portal between the human and nether worlds. Open the lock destroy humankind. At the time of Hellboys discovery the Nazis were planning to exploit his potential. Instead like so many freaks of the superhero genre HB took a shine to humans starting with adopted father Broom (John Hurt). He and other members of a clandestine governmental agency have our backs. In the creature-packed touchingly maudlin sequel ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" humans seem more than a little ungrateful and not quite worthy of the protection that Hellboy girlfriend Liz Sherman Abe Sapien and other denizens of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense in New Jersey offer. And when a truce between humans elves and other beings relegated to invisible realms is sundered by a prince wearing Edgar Winter hair we need someone who bumps back the ""things that go bump in the night."" From the start actor Ron Perlman has made Hellboys personality a droll mix of bravado and boneheadedness. In the original he got jealous and acted out. Here hes constantly flummoxed by Lizs domestic demands. He likes the spotlight a bit too much for a secret weapon a constant source of aggravation for Agent Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) his FBI handler. Hellboys can-do attitude undercut with teen-fella insecurity has made the cigar-puffing baddie a sweetheart too. Emotionally hes all too human. If theres a letdown from the original also directed by Guillermo del Toro and based on Mike Mignolas Dark Horse comic book series its that theres just not enough of the right stuff for the big red lug. Youd have to have a tin ear not to hear the theological musings about fathers fate and free will at the heart of the first ""Hellboy."" Perhaps this is a strange thing to declare of a movie in which the army of the title would lay waste to mankind were it unleashed. Yet for all its marshaling of otherworldly forces ""The Golden Army"" remains a little lighter and a little less satisfying than 2004s big-screen introduction to a terrific comic-book character. Now he and Liz (Selma Blair) live together and things are tense. When your gals a pyrokinetic wonder still honing control of her firestarter gifts well. . . . At times Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) seems less irrational than righteously furious at humankinds abuse of Earths resources. This adds a not-ironed-out wrinkle to the story line. The Nazis of the first ""Hellboy"" were undeniable baddies. Moral certainty seems clouded in del Toro and Mignolas story. Between the first ""Hellboy"" and ""The Golden Army"" director Del Toro made a masterpiece ""Pans Labyrinth"" a fable about a young girl a faun and the horror of fascist Spain. Besides the creepy-crawly ick-cool factor of the ""tooth faeries"" that attack in the opening scenes of this ""Hellboy"" theres not much hoped-for carry-over between the Oscar-garnering film and this romp. The PG-13 ""Hellboy"" is fun. And its unafraid to embrace the schmaltzy. Empath Abe Sapien (incomparable Doug Jones) is smitten with Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) twin to Prince Nuada. And the movie has some fabulous sport with a Barry Manilow hit. ""The Golden Army"" is a sturdy comic-book-inspired outing with a couple of very amusing asides including a tour of a troll market. But Perlman del Toro and Mignola have made Hellboy such a fine brute and hero that its hard not to want more from any story that contains him. ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some language. 1 hour 50 minutes; from the comic book by Mike Mignola; photography by Guillermo Navarro; starring Ron Perlman Selma Blair Doug Jones John Alexander James Dodd Seth MacFarlane Luke Goss Anna Walton Jeffrey Tambor.

No ironic Hollywood stars no weighty character neuroses no mid-movie dramatic twists sinking the fun like an anchor. ""Hellboy II"" is the anti-""Hancock"" a blast of fanboy wit style imagination and prodigious noise that comes on like heavy-bore pop art. Better its title character is to mainstream heroes like Batman and Spider-Man what publisher Dark Horse Comics is to DC and Marvel a scruffy cigar-chomping upstart.You dont need to have read the comics or seen 2004s ""Hellboy"" to play along but heres the FAQ Hellboy - actor Ron Perlman under a ton of glazed-ham makeup - is a demon raised from childhood by humans and currently employed by the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. (Its supposed to be top secret but Hellboy has a bad habit of turning up on YouTube.)Hes short-tempered and sardonic but basically a good sort keeping his horns sawed off and sharing quarters with girlfriend/human torch Liz (Selma Blair) and an aquatic empath - sort of a Creature From the Psychic Friends Network - named Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). Their job is to keep the occult legions (goblins trolls balrogs you name it) from infesting the human world.The elves apparently have had enough of this nonsense. The Kabuki-face Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) overthrows his father (Roy Dotrice) and embarks on a campaign to unleash a crew of unstoppable battle-bots called the Golden Army on mankind. Our heroes are called on to foil him if Hellboy and Liz can stop arguing about his pet cats overrunning their apartment.It all sounds terribly silly and it all plays like a charm because the cast stays in the spirit (tongue-in-cheek but committed) and because del Toro lets his inner comics-freak rip. The Mexican-born director hit the big time with 2006s ""Pans Labyrinth"" but he has always balanced his art-house side (""The Devils Backbone"") with gonzo genre work (""Blade II"") and here the two come close to blending entirely.If youve seen ""Pans Labyrinth"" youll recognize the visual design of the various nasties in ""Hellboy"" as the product of del Toros brain and sketchpad weathered faces lacking eyes molting wings with eyes a gargoyle who has a miniature cathedral growing out of his head. There are tooth fairies but youd better pray they dont get anywhere near the children.In one scene a gargantuan plant-like ""elemental"" stalks lower Manhattan towering over the buildings like Hieronymus Boschs rethink of the Jolly Green Giant. When its wounded flowers and moss spring up from its blood - a touch of unexpected lyricism amidst the mayhem. Indeed you may wonder whose side del Toro and his co-writer ""Hellboy"" creator Mike Mignola are on. The heros job is to protect us helpless humans but next to the elves and other eldritch beings were made to look puny and small-minded turning on the big fella with mob fury in one scene. Its not pretty. Worse its not very believable.""Hellboy"" thankfully pulls back before he starts mewling like Peter Parker. Blairs Liz though has less to do than in the first film and more emotional water to carry and the actress doesnt look too happy about it. ""Hellboy"" is more successful at building a romance between Abe and the villains twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton); theyre two delicate souls carving out a quiet space (complete with Tennyson verse) between the crashes and ka-booms.Another character I wish wed seen more of is Johann Krauss a German paranormal specialist imported by the BPRD to keep Hellboy on a leash. He turns out to be a psychopathic gas - a ghost - inside a diving suit and he looks for all the world like Darth Vader without a head. Two actors John Alexander and James Dodd are credited with his physical movements but the persnickety Teutonic voice comes from Seth MacFarlane of ""Family Guy"" who gives the rivalry between retentive Krauss and explosive Hellboy the topspin of classic vaudeville patter.""Hellboy II"" is bigger louder and a smidgen more mainstream than the first movie and I expect hard-core fans of the comic wont like it as much. There are signs of tired sequelitis in the personal dilemma Liz faces halfway through in Jeffrey Tambors officious BPRD bureaucrat and in the way the clanky plot outstrips the wit in the final scenes.The movies rescued time and again though by the soulful swagger of Perlmans performance - he plays Hellboy like a smarter Thing or a fully self-actualized Hulk - and by del Toros flair for the baroque. The filmmaker loves the tatty pop energy of comic books their speech-balloon dialogue and muscular sense of fantasy. He knows that on the page as on the screen you can draw anything and make it spring madly to life.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movienation.

They alone testify to his vulnerable fear of non-conformity--the fragility masked by his rough-edged tude--which screenwriter and director Guillermo Del Toro captured in his first film. Four years later Del Toros fame has risen while the devil spawn creature that made his stateside rep has flattened and floundered. Despite a decent turn by Ron Perlman here Hellboy is no operatic tragic hero but a third-rate Bruce Willis. Betrayed by Del Toros script and a tone that shifts from jaunty spy parody to shameless Lord of the Rings mimic hes cheapened into just another cocky PI whose only real conflict is he cant stop punching people in the face. A preamble where we learn that as a bucktoothed 11-year-old Hellboy believed in both Howdy Doody and Santa Claus adds little depth. For much of the film neither does his love affair with firestarter Liz (Selma Blair). The last time we saw them her soul was stolen; now the drama is Hellboy misplaced her toothbrush. Comedy doesnt suit this moody franchise. The originals one misstep was casting the great Jeffrey Tambor as the head of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Development--the baggage of George Bluth turned a sly role to a smirking slap on the back. Those who also grimaced at guileless agent John Myers will be pleased to know hes been dispatched to Antarctica with no more fanfare than an expository sentence. But while Del Toro and his fleet of artists are dazzling designers--every creature is astounding and even a carrying case is an intricate whirligig--when it comes to humor theyre all thumbs. Del Toro creates great machines but besides the fluke of the first Hellboy his characters leave me cold. All the atmosphere of Pans Labyrinth couldnt excuse that its lead tot was maudlin sap and I know youre not expecting a defense of Wesley Snipes in Blade II. A duet between Hellboy and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) to Barry Manilow is a disposable gag that could have been written for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. A fight scene has Hellboy battle while clutching a baby in his tail for nothing more than cheap drama and a catch phrase. Worse nearly every baddie from a tiny tooth fairy (who lunges for the mouth with a nasty dental drill whine) to a skyscraping tree god is dispatched with a bullet. Wheres the fantasy in that? As Hellboy wisecracks towards his final battle with an outraged Elf Prince (Luke Goss) who wants to awaken 490 golden soldiers great self-repairing clockworks of death to avenge his people on the nature-destroying humans (now theres a sub-theme we havent heard this week) hes asked why he chooses to align with those who dismiss him as a freak and wreck the earth. Hellboy doesnt have an answer. And neither do we--why are audiences again being forced to side against nature? But its a question worth making a movie about and this sequel feels like a disposable stepping-stone towards it. Hopefully Perlman wont be made to mug his way through that plot. Only with the warning that Liz is expecting the demon childs assumedly half-demon spawn Del Toros apt to muck it up with diaper jokes though Im sure his Pampers will look phenomenal. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Directing a sequel to a modestly successful comic-book adaptation might seem like a perverse choice to follow up an Oscar-winning international triumph like Pans Labyrinth. But for Guillermo del Toro directing the Hellboy movies is the opposite of slumming His affection for the comics motley gang of misfits is palpable in every scene. Del Toro makes movies fanboys love in part because hes such a fanboy himself. With Hellboy II The Golden Army del Toro proves his geek credentials once again by collaborating with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola on the story hiring Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane to voice a fantastical creature that looks like Robby The Robots off-brand cousin and talks like Colonel Klink and including a conspicuous homage to John Landis. Ron Perlman returns as the films loveable title character a demon gone good whos tough on the outside but tender underneath with a soft spot for kittens candy and babies. With his formidable physique cigars giant guns and winning way with a one-liner hes part McBain-style action-hero parody part Frankenstein-like outcast. Hellboy is the key ass-kicking component of a secret government paranormal squad that includes fiery girlfriend Selma Blair a bright cerebral chap (Doug Jones) who bears an unfortunate resemblance to the Creature From The Black Lagoon the aforementioned MacFarlane-voiced German monstrosity and hapless human sidekick Jeffrey Tambor. Theyre like the Ghostbusters if the Ghostbusters were phantasms and beasties themselves. In his latest adventure Hellboy and the gang take on an otherworldly prince out to take over the world with the eponymous golden army. Hellboy 2 breezes along on the strength of Perlmans brawling charisma a likeable tone and a deft combination of goofball humor pathos and big action setpieces. It reaches sublime heights in three virtuoso sequences a hilariously boozy Barry Manilow sing-along between the lovesick Perlman and Jones a lyrical sequence where a giant tree monster becomes a leafy green paradise and an eye-popping trip to a troll bazaar that recalls the canteen sequence in Star Wars and highlights the films phenomenal extensive creature design. Hellboy II cant help but feel slight following Pans Labyrinth but thats part of its charm. Think of it as a pleasant diversion for del Toro and his fans before the epic task of mounting The Hobbit for producer (and fellow geek-god) Peter Jackson.

Its Christmas Eve 1955 and little Red - a horned tailed devil-child spawned by the Nazis and now living in New Mexico with his bearded benevolent professor surrogate dad - is getting the lowdown on a mythical kingdom and its invincible robotic fighting force.The boy with the skin tone of a Red Hot wears cute pjs watches Howdy Doody on TV and has a goofy toothy grin. Quite a few years later - like around now - Hellboy is a hulking cranky grown-up played by Ron Perlman and a barn of scarlet-patinaed prosthetics. But the teachings of Professor Broom (John Hurt) and the talk about Santa have stuck because Hellboy is fighting for the good guys.And that yarn about the invincible robots? Uh-oh its true. A fellow with flowing white locks and a pasty David Bowie face - an exiled prince from someplace called Bethmoora - has set loose the very same Golden Army on the streets of New York.A hyperactive sequel to the 2004 hit based on Mike Mignolas comic books and once again directed by Guillermo Del Toro Hellboy II The Golden Army goes somewhere the first Hellboy never ventured into the Realms of Tedium.Unleashing every creature he designed for his Oscar-winning Pans Labyrinth - and trying out a few more that hell probably bring to his announced two-picture adaptation of The Hobbit - Del Toro crams the screen with winged tentacled beasts with teeny demonic critters behemoth stone monsters and multi-orbed mushroom-headed wraiths.But for all its eye-popping Middle Earth-meets-Mos Eisley majesty - its mix of Heironymus Bosch Jules Verne and George Lucas - Hellboy II is a letdown. For one thing the stogie-chompin star of the show feels like a guest at his own party shoved aside to make room for Del Toros macabre menagerie and for Reds fellow freakazoids in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. (The BPRD based in Trenton is a clandestine government operation where super-powered weirdos hang out awaiting the call to save humankind.)Perlman manages to toss off a few wiseguy asides - and theres serious relationship business going on between Red and his pyro-kinetic girlfriend Liz (the heavy-lidded Selma Blair). But with aquatic psychic dude Abe Sapien and the new goggle-headed mystic Johann Kraus not to mention the naggy bureaucratic boss Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) Mr. Hellboy hardly has room onscreen. And then theres that goth maniac Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) and his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) - and you know theyre twins because they share hair stylists and experience simultaneous nosebleeds. One or the other is forever hanging around.Hellboy II is not without its moments of twisted pop-cult mirth. A Barry Manilow tune figures prominently and Jimmy Kimmel shows up on TV. The Mexican filmmaker pays homage to The Bride of Frankenstein and to The Wizard of Oz and Frank Oz too (Del Toro must have owned a VHS copy of The Dark Crystal).But the level of mayhem is ratcheted up so high that it doesnt matter whether youre on the streets of Manhattan the hills of Scotland or the caverns of Bethmoora - all places Hellboy II takes you. Ultimately the spectacle of computer-generated baddies battling computer-generated goodies - no matter how amazingly weird and wonderful they appear - wears you down.Hellboy II The Golden Army 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Guillermo Del Toro.

"The Boy is back in a sequel with bite - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Boy is back in a sequel with biteJuly 11 2008|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICHELLBOY II THE GOLDEN ARMY I can barely keep up with the mythology put forth by the ""Hellboy"" series but I enjoyed the first film and I enjoyed the new one. The best scene in ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" writer-director Guillermo Del Toros sequel to his comic book adaptation ""Hellboy"" involves tooth fairies. These are not the sort of tooth fairies you want round your pillow at night. These tooth fairies eat teeth and conjured by an underworld prince hellbent on taking over the planet they provide cigar-chomping tough guy Hellboy and his team from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense with some formidable opposition.The tooth-fairy swarm scene reminds you just how inventive Del Toro is and how in the right hands digital effects creature design and directorial elan can work together to give you the best sort of willies. (Del Toro was the fantasist behind ""Pans Labyrinth.) Its as vivid as anything in the first ""Hellboy.""The movie overall is engaging though its more cavalier regarding story and relentless in its action than its predecessor. Del Toros script based on the Mike Mignola comic book focuses rather dutifully on Hellboys domestic strife with girlfriend and pyro-tyro Liz (Selma Blair looking like a live-action version of Colette in ""Ratatouille""). Ron Perlman is great to have around as Hellboy; as before his oaky mellow voice belies all manner of freakish rage and loner angst. I wish though he had more to do in his own sequel. Del Toro and his sterling team of designers sometimes make it hard on the actors to be noticed. Here for example by the time we get to the climactic battle between the forces of good and the underworld princes mechanical golden army of doom its simply the largest and last in a long line of combat sequences.But there is an awful lot to soak up here visually and that counts for a good deal. The creature and makeup effects are by Mike Elizalde (""Men in Black"") who is a genius. The adversarial Prince Nuada (Luke Goss good with a spear and a variety of blades) is appalled at how humankind has trashed the planet. Hes Al Gore with unlimited mixed martial arts training and as odd as it seems ""Hellboy II"" ""WALLE"" and Werner Herzogs documentary ""Encounters at the End of the World"" are all saying the same thing. Wed better tend our garden more mindfully or not even Hellboy will be able to save us.- - -MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some language)Running time 150Opening 1201 a.m. Friday.Starring Ron Perlman (Hellboy); Selma Blair (Liz); Doug Jones (Abe Sapien); Jeffrey Tambor (Tom Manning); John Hurt (professor Broom)Written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro based on Mike Mignolas comic book; photographed by Guillermo Navarro; edited by Bernat Vilaplana; music by Danny Elfman; production design by Stephen Scott; produced by Lawrence Gordon Mike Richardson and Lloyd Levin.

SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In Hellboy II The Golden Army (   out of four) the giant crimson daredevil is a snarky bad-boy superhero taunted and misunderstood by the masses. This weekend the cigar-chomping beer-swilling big guy faces off with another reviled superhero Hancock. Hellboy wins pretty much hands down. PHOTOS Director del Toro introduces all his Hellboy creatures MORE Things are golden for Selma Blair HELLISH MAKEOVER Goss loses himself in bad-guy makeup CLIP Get in on the Hellboy II action SUMMER MOVIE CALENDAR Whats in theaters? With director Guillermo del Toros fantastical vision on overdrive tempered by an occasionally self-mocking sense of humor this Hellboy sequel is a quintessential summer movie that delivers plenty of inventive thrills. The action is well-paced the production design striking and the creatures and special effects spectacular. Del Toro is an extraordinary visual stylist who creates monsters that stay in our heads and haunt our reveries long after the credits run. Who can forget the saggy pallid creature from Pans Labyrinth whose eyes resided in its hands? Similarly freakish and fascinating beings populate Hellboy. The films main drawback however is their multiplicity. A barrage of mind-blowing beings borders on overkill. One longs to concentrate on maybe half a dozen weird creatures. But the movie is filled to the peripheries with frighteningly odd characters. This is particularly true of the segment at the Troll Market which brings to mind the Star Wars cantina crossed with bustling Diagon Alley from Harry Potter. In this installment Hellboy (Ron Perlman) must battle the malevolent Prince Nuada (Luke Goss who looks like a scarred version of Potters Lucius Malfoy). At Hellboys side are his Bureau for Paranormal Research and Development colleagues an array that includes his fiery girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and the robotic/aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). While the various action sequences are exciting an early one with swarms of voracious tooth fairies drags on. Still Hellboy II is highly imaginative and consistently amusing without pretensions. A highlight is a vivid duel with Hellboy battling a giant forest creature while cradling a baby either in one of his giant mitts or curled up in his tail. In fact infants figure intriguingly into this movie. The next sequel just might be ""Hellbaby Devil Flambe."" (Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence and some language. Running time 1 hour 50 minutes. Opens at midnight tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide.)

"Hellboy full of good summer fun - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Hellboy full of good summer fun Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Nothing called Hellboy be it comic book or comic book movie is going to take itself too seriously. Just saying that title aloud -- HELL-boy -- is enough to make most people chuckle.But Mexican director Guillermo del Toros take on Mike Mignolas comic book evolves in Hellboy II The Golden Army. He makes a movie that is all brawn and bravura big guy-big guns-big trench coat. And he stirs in a little of his Pans Labyrinth pathos a wistfulness over a world of magic that weve lost. Hes still a better director and visualist than he is a screenwriter. Its a lighthearted movie but rarely a funny one. Del Toro still isnt comfortable with English-language zingers or punchy tough-guy dialogue. The TV commercials that have Hellboy (Ron Perlman in a red latex suit) taking on NBCs Chuck in a video game or riffing with James Lipton in a Hellboy Inside the Actors Studio are funnier than anything del Toro wrote for the movie.But as big mindlessly fantastical summer entertainment goes this falls comfortably between Iron Man (the gold standard) and the not-quite Incredible Hulk. Its a visually striking mildly amusing way to kill a couple of hours. The Golden Army takes us back to Hellboys childhood when his adoptive scientist-dad (John Hurt) reads him a tale of the ancient wars between ogres goblins elves and humans. He tells of a mechanical army the King of the Elves concocted one which only a truce kept from wiping out humanity.Now that elf kings pale martial-artist son (Luke Goss) is back from exile anxious to revive the Golden Army ""the harbingers of death the unstoppable tide.""Not if Hellboy and his ragtag crew of demons from the B.P.R.D. -- the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense -- have any say about it.Perlman is a very old hand at wearing the latex and playing a mythical figure. The onetime ""Beast"" of TVs Beauty and the Beast downs his Tecates (Mexican beer) chomps on his Cubans and chews up the scenery as a ""freak"" who isnt fazed by anything or anyone this world (or the ""other"" one) throws at him. Hes Lee Marvin in latex. Hellboy has Liz ( Selma Blair) his flame (literally) and his pal the brainy watery Abe ( Doug Jones replacing David Hyde Pierce from Hellboy) and a vaporous Teutonic boss (amusingly voiced by Seth McFarlane). Pity he doesnt have much pithy to say. Every new horror or terror unleashed by Prince Nuada is only worth another ""Ooooh crap"" from Hellboy.""You will pay for what happened to my friend down there"" spits the Prince.""You take checks?"" Hellboy brimstones back.Del Toro drags out the few jokes he tries (a Barry Manilow love duet) one or two verses too many. A few jokes from a script doctor might have helped.But even if the humor and heart (some Blade Runner/X-Men lessons about what nonhumans can teach us) dont quite pay off The Golden Army ticks over gears ratchets and cogs like the clockwork comic book movie that it is one that benefits from lovely baroque technology and imaginative retro-looking trolls and such left over from Pans Labyrinth. And if theres anybody up to the task of chewing all that lavish scenery its Perlman. He makes even the weaker moments of this hellishly fun.

That means Ive never read a Hellboy comic the first of which appeared in 1993 (when I was well past 12). In fact Im not so sure Id even heard of the big red lug until 2004 when del Toro made the first Hellboy movie although I bet at the time I pretended that I knew all about him. These days not reading comics and graphic novels marks one as a pop-culture loser which goes to show you how topsy-turvy the world is--in my day comic-book kids got beat up.A primer then for the secretly uninitiated Hellboy or ""Red"" as his friends call him (played by Ron Perlman in the films) is a demon from Hell (literally) who entered this earthly realm when Hitlers minions opened a portal to you-know-where while attempting to form an alliance with the Big Guy down below. Rescued by the Allies and raised by a gentle British professor (John Hurt) Hellboy has burnt-red skin a long tail thick horns on his forehead (filed down to stubs) and a massive right arm made of stone--the ""Right Hand of Doom"" in creator Mike Mignolas comic. Red packs a mean right punch but luckily raised on Howdy Doody and Santa Claus hes fighting on the side of man not with the evildoers who keep coming up from Hell to slay us all. Score one for nurture versus nature.In the new flick Hellboy and his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) who can turn herself into a ball of fire at will are living in a government-run bunker belowManhattan hunting demons. As Liz gets ready to announce her pregnancy up pops the centuries-dead-yet-still-stylish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss channeling David Bowie) scouring Manhattan for a shard from a magic crown that when reassembled will raise the titular Golden Army whose soldiers turn out to look like high-end Neiman Marcus-catalog versions of Transformer toys.Despite the rosary beads Red wraps around his wrist Hellboy II doesnt have much on its mind but few will care since del Toro and his stellar Pans Labyrinth team including Oscar-winning cinematographer Guillermo Navarro stage one virtuoso set-piece after another. Chomping on his cigar the otherwise uninteresting Red--I think I just got banned from this months Comic-Con--hulks out against not only the vast Golden Army but tiny pissed-off tooth fairies a magnificent multi-winged multi-eyed Angel of Death (Doug Jones) and in the films action centerpiece a 70-foot forest demon that looks like a leaner meaner cousin of Lord of the Rings mighty Treebeard. (Del Toro of course is set to direct The Hobbit for LOTR mastermind Peter Jackson.)Smitten still with the movies of his youth the 43-year-old del Toro joyfully references everything from the cantina in Star Wars to the Alien pod field to Ghostbusters marauding dough boy. A B-movie director (see Mimic Blade II) with a touch of the poet about him (see The Devils Backbone) del Toro was elevated to the status of capital-A artist with 2006s Pans Labyrinth a Nazi-era Through the Looking Glass fantasy with underworld creatures so strange and wondrous that few seemed to notice how mean-spirited and unpleasant the film itself was. With this new Hellboy del Toro is clearly coasting and while theres no shame in having some summertime fun (and making some summertime money) the question hangs Is del Toro a mad genius or an imaginative hack? Or both?Time and hobbits should tell the tale and in the meantime the violent but gore-free Hellboy II The Golden Army will amaze 12-year-olds and amuse their parents although at some point one spouse may lean over and whisper to the other ""Wasnt that stretchy-faced demon with three eyes in Pans Labyrinth?"" Maybe so Marge but wow isnt it beautiful?

"Review Devilish humor stokes Hellboy II"" - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Devilish humor stokes Hellboy II"" By Christy LemireAssociated PressPosted 07/10/2008 120149 AM PDTUpdated 07/10/2008 034225 PM PDTWords dont really do justice in attempting to describe the wondrous array of misfits and monsters Guillermo del Toro has concocted in ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" Truly his is a world you have to experience for yourself to appreciate it fully -- if you dare that is. In following up the original ""Hellboy"" from 2004 and his Academy Award-winning 2006 masterpiece ""Pans Labyrinth"" the director has outdone himself in both absurd humor and wild imagination. At times theres almost too much to take in all at once -- everything from hulking trolls with thick tusks to tiny tooth fairies that look delicate but actually delight in feasting on human bones. The visuals are the star of course. But the sequel which del Toro scripted from a story he co-wrote with ""Hellboy"" comic book creator Mike Mignola wouldnt be nearly as much fun without Ron Perlman returning as its wisecracking beer-guzzling kitten-nuzzling hero.Not only does Perlman completely get del Toros twisted sense of humor he thrives on it. As the films title character -- who grows from boy-devil to man-devil to reluctant noir-style crime fighter -- Perlman shows not just perfect comic timing but also an irresistible ability to laugh at himself. This time Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense must stop the power-hungry Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) from awakening a dormant army of indestructible golden soldiers. Advertisement Seems all the underground creatures and the humans forged a pact long ago to keep the peace and keep the Golden Army from causing any more death and destruction between the two races. Nuada has grown tired of that and takes action -- even though his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) has begged him to back down.For Hellboy though the potential obliteration of all humankind is just one more hassle with which to deal. Hed rather hang out and enjoy his cigars. Having said that hes not exactly a shy individual and revels in the attention his misadventures draw from the ravenous New York tabloids. (Or as his sophisticated colleague Abe Sapien puts it ""God I hate YouTube."") Doug Jones returns as Abe the turquoise-tinted fish-man with keen intuition and a taste for Vivaldi; hes also the beneficiary of some the scripts best lines.Jeffrey Tambor again plays the jittery bureaucrat who runs the operation -- a rare quasi-villainous role for the comedian. And of course Selma Blair is back as Liz Hellboys (literally) fiery girlfriend. Shes all business when it comes to fighting bad guys and Blair is appropriately exasperated by our anti-heros brutish ways. But she also brings out the sensitive side in the man she affectionately calls Red. The on-again off-again battle between Hellboy and Nuada drags on a bit causing the pacing to sag. Maybe thats an inevitable consequence of coming on so strong off the top. But by about the two-thirds mark ""Hellboy II"" runs out of steam just as the motley crew of do-gooders makes its way to Ireland where the Golden Army is being stored. Their journey does provoke a clever ""Wizard of Oz"" reference though. But the best pop-culture moment of all comes courtesy of Barry Manilow because in del Toros beautifully bizarro universe where creatures come in all shapes and sizes theres even a place for 1970s schmaltz.

Hellboy (Ron Perlman) a demon has just kicked some bad-guy butt and after a shower is relaxing with a few beers. His pal Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) a sort of fish man is pining away for a princess by listening to Barry Manilow. Hellboy offers him a drink - ""Youre in love have a beer"" - Abe likes it and soon theyre both pretty far gone singing along to Cant Smile Without You and really meaning it. Cut to Abe digging a six-pack out of the fridge bemoaning to Hellboy that ""this is the last one."" Its funny and to anyone whos ever tried to drink away the longing for a would-be love its perfect. It shows the humanity del Toro invests in these bizarre creatures that inhabit his imagination and his films allowing us to identify with them root for them care about them. Its the kind of thing that makes Hellboy much more than a big-action small-brain summer movie. Del Toro and Mike Mignola on whose comic book the Hellboy films are based expand their scope this time around to encompass a war against humanity by a race of underworld creatures led by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who needs the third piece of a crown to bring to life the invincible Golden Army. Unfortunately for Nuada his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) has the missing piece and doesnt plan to let him realize his evil intentions. Which you know whatever. Its all an excuse to let Hellboy and his pals kick into action. Which they do several times. But not without heart. There is a scene for instance in which Hellboy to save humans must kill some sort of gigantic forest creature. Nuada shows up to question Hellboys true loyalty - are you one of them or one of us? Hellboys decision isnt surprising but the aftermath - the flowering of a city street - is. As Nuada plots his takeover Hellboy is trying to get used to domestic life with Liz (Selma Blair) whose pyrokinetic abilities - she can start fires basically - dont match the seeming lack of warmth in their relationship. Bureaucratic boob Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) is still trying to keep the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense of which Hellboy Liz and Abe are members a secret. His ineptitude leads to Johann Krauss (the voice of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane) coming aboard. Hes basically a form of gas who inhabits what looks like an ancient diving suit which makes him the perfect target for Hellboys smart-aleck jabs. Creatures abound both good and bad; most would be right at home in del Toros Pans Labyrinth. Not to give too much away but youll probably never think about the tooth fairy in the same way again. The Troll Market a secret realm hidden from humans is a marvel with all manner of creatures roaming its streets. Of course the freakish members of the Bureau fit right in here. ""They dont stare"" Hellboy tells Liz. Del Toro hints at that feeling of exclusion several times but never follows through completely. Of course these creatures feel different - because they are. Besides theres not a lot of time to mope with Nuada showing up all over the place. The final battle is impressive and involves both raw power and sacrifice. But its the scene before that grabs you. In the underground world where the Golden Army sleeps (for now) the elegantly lethal Angel of Death - the most striking creature in the film - offers Liz a choice. Without going into too much detail it boils down to short-term gain vs. long-term destruction. Her answer sets in motion the rest of the film (and not coincidentally whets the appetite for another sequel). Perlman is a delight as the wise-cracking Hellboy chomping a cigar and methodically fighting evil in the manner of a person who would rather try to crash through a brick wall than walk around it. Blair and Jones are left with little to do by the end of the movie but have their moments earlier on. But the film unquestionably belongs to del Toro a true original in a time when that trait is not necessarily valued. Like any artist he spots magic where the rest of us dont. We probably dont want to know exactly what it is del Toro sees when he turns out the lights but as Hellboy II makes clear were richer for spending a couple of hours with what he brings to the screen.

Big squishy mutants and dreamy monsters. Otherworldly tentacled zomboid beasties. Hes a master at creating them a talent that I would not hesitate to call childlike; its also a gift well-suited to our era. Del Toro can win awards for a highbrow Night Gallery episode like Pans Labyrinth with its fantastical images and fascism-is-bad message and he can then turn around and make a hard-driving psychedelic action-movie fantasia like Hellboy II The Golden Army about a domesticated devil hulk and his superfreak comrades. In Hellboy II del Toro pushes his fetish for all things weird and shape-shifty to the extreme; he makes us feel childlike too. You can taste the ripeness of his imagination when you see the new addition to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense team a German scientist named Johann Krauss who consists entirely of...gas. (He lives in a robot suit to give the fumes some form and his voice is provided by Family Guys Seth MacFarlane for that hint of Hogans Heroes kitsch.) Hellboy (Ron Perlman) the stogie-sucking demon of a crime fighter with his sawed-off underworld horns and mighty stone edifice of a giant right fist is now plunged into a cosmic culture war. An ancient race led by the pasty scoundrel Prince Nuada (Luke Goss in a performance that suggests Marilyn Manson played by Tilda Swinton) has declared a holy war on all of humanity. To achieve his apocalyptic vision Nuada must gather the three sections of a mystical crown which will activate the Golden Army a phalanx of clanking medieval robots each with a chest cavity full of glowing industrial fire. Thats quite an image of sinister magic and Hellboy II has a lot more of them. The plot is really a fancy excuse for del Toro to keep forging his close encounters of the squirmy kind. New York gets attacked by a giant plant-monster (it has the head of a praying mantis and vines for limbs) which would have looked right at home in a 50s atomic-schlock horror film and in Ireland theres a warlock gatekeeper who reveals a face thats a blade of flesh -- as well as wings speckled with eyes an image to give Salvador Dali pause. The films digital-effects artists deserve props but what makes a creature feature like Hellboy II so much more exciting than say The Incredible Hulk is that del Toros inventions dont just have ""attitude."" They have temperament. Their personalities seem to have emerged right out of their skewed fairy-tale-on-acid physiognomies. Thats true of the movies heroes as well. Hellboy with his skin the color of tandoori chicken has a red-hot temper to match and Perlman whos even funnier -- more grumpily assured -- than he was in the first Hellboy has mastered a tone of self-deprecatory wise-guy blues; if you can forget how he looks he sounds like George Clooney after a rough night. Hellboys sad comedy is his deep-down normalcy -- the fact that no one sees past his facade. No one that is but Liz (Selma Blair) the outwardly normal girl who loves him because shes got some major hellfire of her own She ignites like a human cigarette lighter and Blair glaring through those orange flames lets you know that shes as angry as that fire is. Abe Sapien the epicene British gill-man played with courtly grace by Doug Jones has been given a love interest -- the evil princes twin sister (Anna Walton) -- which only heightens his anachronistic pained delicacy. When he and Hellboy sing a lonely drunken duet to Barry Manilows ""Cant Smile Without You"" its a priceless moment because its really tweaking the hidden torment of every superhero in history. The Paranormal Research and Defense team is basically a kinkier version of the X-Men crew or the Fantastic Four but in Hellboy II their collective oddity -- familiar though it is -- has an appealing outsize grandeur. If the movies plot is mostly comic-book boilerplate del Toro stages all of the action brilliantly whether hes choreographing an onslaught of skittery spidery face-huggers or tracing the rhythmic thrusting assault of flying swords. The Golden Army dazzles like something out of Jason and the Argonauts. To make a comic-book fantasy this derivative yet this dazzling requires more than technique. It takes a ? director in touch with his inner hellboy.

Daily Edition Login to download Film Review Hellboy II The Golden Army 1032 AM PDT 6/29/2008 by Michael Rechtshaffen  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Empty TWITTER Empty When is a big studio picture not a big studio picture?When were talking Universals ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" and the filmmaker happens to be Guillermo del Toro.Armed with a slightly bigger budget than his 2004 original and with more clout after the Oscar-nominated success of ""Pans Labyrinth"" del Toros latest take on the Mike Mignola comic book is uncompromisingly the product of his wildly fantastical imagination.Playing it faster and looser if somewhat less focused than the first ""Hellboy"" the Los Angeles Film Festivals official closer (neatly book-ending with curtain-raiser ""Wanted"") should have no problem building on the 100 million-plus its predecessor grossed internationally when it officially enters the summer derby on July 11.Of course just how much more would depend on how the fanboys will feel about sequences like Red and Abe drunkenly singing along to Barry Manilows ""Cant Smile Without You."" With the origin story out of the way del Toro wastes little time in getting down to business. When a longstanding truce between the underground-dwelling original sons of the earth and humankind is broken by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) the rebellious son of King Balor (Ron Perlmans old ""Beauty and the Beast"" co-star Roy Dotrice) something must be done to prevent him from reawakening the killing machines known as the Golden Army.Enter the terrific Perlmans cigar-chomping Tecate-chugging Red whos been shacking up with the pyrokinetic Liz (an effectively brooding Selma Blair) in his pad over at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.Also back to save the day is the aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones now also doing the vocals that last time were handled by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce) as well as long-suffering B.P.R.D. bureaucrat Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor).Joining the highly dysfunctional family is the Germanic Johann Krauss (John Alexander and James Dodd) a protoplasmic robot who constantly gets in Reds face.With writer-director del Toro given free license to go where his singular vision takes him ""Hellboy II"" plays like Guillermos Greatest Hits with even hotter visual effects -- Lizs engulfing flames have come a long way in four years -- and a winking nod to ""The Wizard of Oz"" tossed into the crazy mix for good measure.

Curmudgeonly cantankerous cigar-chomping Hellboy is a cross between a 40s noir detective and a burning fireplace but hes also cool enough to make ""Hellboy II The Golden Army"" the hipsters hit of the summer. Yes Catholic imagery has always run rampant through helmer Guillermo del Toros movies including ""Pans Labyrinth"" which he made in between the two ""Hellboy"" entries but hes really an evangelist of fanboy excess Given the right push by Universal hell be making fantasy-horror acolytes out of the heretofore unconverted. In a previous life del Toro might have been a maker of clocks -- clocks inhabited by gargoyles instead of cuckoos and which exploded on the hour. But theres a precision to the visual ornateness of ""Hellboy II"" that exceeds even that of its predecessor. Its certainly a more deliberately (and successfully) funny movie thanks largely to the drily ironic Hellboy -- Ron Perlman who returns with the rest of the cast and without whom an onscreen Hellboy would have been almost unthinkable. Based on the comicbooks by del Toros co-scripter Mike Mignola the pic finds Hellboy about to become Hell Man -- his incendiary girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) is pregnant although she doesnt tell him till much later. But since we learn this at the beginning of the film it shades everything that follows -- a elaborate sequence early on in which Hellboy battles a towering green forest deity on the streets of New York while balancing a baby in his arms gives us an indication of just what a caring paternal figure the guy can be despite the fact that he looks like hes shrink-wrapped in red Naugahyde and has the temperament of a wolverine. But the reason the movie plays so well has nothing to do with the leading mans paternal instincts; rather its rooted in del Toros rococo instincts for the stylishly creepy and crawlingly macabre his clockmakers preoccupation with detail and a flair for combining state-of-the-art technology with his taste for the antique the gothic the Catholic. Not to disparage the f/x guys but whats onscreen in ""Hellboy II"" is all about the seismic eruptions in del Toros head. Comparing his work to most fantasy cinema is like comparing cave drawings to the Cathedral of Cologne. Still ""Hellboy IIs"" widespread popularity will be about the humor which begins in a flashback to Christmas 1955 when the young Hellboy -- the progeny of a collaboration between the Nazis and Satan -- is awaiting Santa Claus. His father figure Professor Broom (John Hurt) reads him a story about an ancient people who created a Golden Army that was so invincible and ruthless it had to be retired; a pact made with the human race; and a crown divided -- two parts to the ancients one to the humans with the army in cold storage until the crown was reassembled. This is a bedtime story? On Christmas Eve? The tale does serve as a preamble to what will follow some time later (50 years? These so-called people age well). Hellboy is working for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense alongside Liz and the Piscean Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and under the supervision of the unctuous Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) who urges Hellboy to keep his work quiet. Undercover. Clandestine. Be discreet Naturally the first big fight scene ends up with Hellboy crashing out of a burning building and onto a police car. The instigator of all this mayhem is the otherworldly martial-artsy Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who wants his people to regain their rightful place in the order of things; his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) knowing her bro is bonkers sides with the humans and hides the key part of the crown. The results include chases battles and a lot of quick-cooking mythology. And of course creatures. Nuada is assisted by what seems to be a tusked gorilla with porcupine spindles on his back and an iron fist that turns into a medieval mace; the small evil fairy-cockroaches that Nuada unleashes upon an unsuspecting crowd at an auction house (where the crown is up for bid) are efficiently carnivorous and natteringly unnerving. The weak link in all this fun is Nuada himself. Goss embodies all the menace of Keanu Reeves and his voice is roundly unimposing. The movie bogs down only when the story leaves the city and heads for Ireland where inexplicably the Golden Army dwells. The armys awakening and combat is easily the least interesting sequence in the film -- the most conventionally chaotic and pedestrian. But Hellboys encounter with Nuada atop a giant mechanism that looks like the insides of a cosmic watch is invigorating. And probably the result of del Toro channeling one of his past lives in Switzerland.
