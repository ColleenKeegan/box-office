A master of understatement he conveys a sense of enormous power held in check. The same could be said of his first feature as a director ""Three Burials"" a laconic tale of revenge loyalty and redemption on the Texas-Mexico border. Jones plays Pete Perkins a ranch foreman whose good friend Melquiades (Julio Cesar Cedillo) an illegal-migrant worker from Mexico is shot in cold blood by a trigger-happy racist border patrol-man (Barry Pepper). The politics of illegal immigration is not what interests Jones and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga (""21 Grams"") who imbue Petes quixotic quest to bury his friend in Mexico with a streak of pitch-black humor some bawdy detours and a touch of sanguine sun-baked poetry Sam Peckinpah would have liked. Opens 12/14. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The ProducersDirected by Susan StromanMel Brookss 1968 comedy ""The Producers"" about a Broadway producer and an accountant trying to make a killing by mounting a show guaranteed to flop--the musical ""Springtime for Hitler""--was broadly theatrical to begin with. Now we have Susan Stromans stubbornly faithful movie of the musical with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick and the theatricality is off the charts. Lane aims for the balconies; Broderick tones it down for the camera a bit. Its fun to see Uma Thurman do a broad Swedish-sexpot number and ""Springtime"" itself with Gary Beachs hilariously fey Hitler is still a hoot. Filled with brazenly old-fashioned Nazi jokes fag jokes and little-old-lady sex jokes ""The Producers"" is knowingly tasteless. But why see the movie musical when you could rent the movie that inspired it? Opens 12/16.Cache Directedby Michael HanekeThe Austrian director Michael Haneke is a maestro of discomfort. ""Cache "" (""Hidden"") his unnervingly provocative new movie jangles your nerves as expertly as a big-studio thriller. But Hanekes methods are the antithesis of Hollywoods. He provides no consolations or closure and he doesnt use shock cuts and scary music cues to make us gasp. His subject is a cultured Parisian media couple (artfully played by Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) whose comfortable life unravels when they discover someone is making surveillance tapes of their home. Then an ominous threatening drawing arrives. Who is targeting them? What do they want? Haneke subtly merges the personal and the political using thriller motifs to explore issues of guilt conscience and responsibility. Auteuils enraged quest to find his tormentor leads back both to repressed childhood secrets and to Frances colonial past in Algeria. This brilliantly disturbing movie is constructed with surgical precision. Haneke lets no one off the hook least of all the viewer. Opens 12/23.Match PointDirected by Woody AllenThe change of locale from New York to London has done Woody Allen a world of good. As has oft been said ""Match Point"" is his best movie since ... fill in the blank. Dont expect laughs. Irish tennis pro Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a classic young man from the provinces on the make in London. Chris gets taken up by a wealthy young man about town (Matthew Goode) then marries his sister (Emily Mortimer) and enters her fathers (Brian Cox) business. The snake in Chriss garden is his brother-in-laws sullen irresistible American girlfriend (Scarlett Johansson). Chriss dilemma will call to mind ""A Place in the Sun "" ""Room at the Top"" and Allens own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" All this deja vu keeps ""Match Point"" from total success. Though the tale is told with crisp sangfroid and a wonderful twist theres hardly a scene I havent seen somewhere else.

"Tommy Lee Jones Three Burials. Slate Sign In Sign Up Tommy Lee Jones Three Burials. Tommy Lee Jones Three Burials. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 9 2006 216 PM Horse Feathers Tommy Lee Jones half-baked western The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. By Stephen Metcalf The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada Tommy Lee Jones is a magnet on screen; he cant help it we cant help it and nobody should be made to feel bad about that. Whats so remarkable about Jones isnt that a not-too-easy-on-the-eyes actor--his head often looks like a root vegetable thats been pulled before its time--made it so big then stayed so elevated on the Hollywood A-list. Whats remarkable is how long Jones had previously been relegated to Hollywood workman status as late as 1992 taking second billing to the likes of Steven Seagal and playing characters named Quint and Mitch and Eddie Mallard in nothing movies. It wasnt until he barked out ""What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard target search of every gas station residence warehouse farmhouse henhouse outhouse and dog house in that area"" and the paying audience for a nifty remake of the old TV show The Fugitive barked back silently and in unison ""Yes Sir"" that Jones went from being an actor to being a movie star. Like a lot of late bloomers--if you can call Al Gores four-year college roommate a starter on the Harvard football team and an actor who from about the age of 30 never went six months without work a ""late bloomer""--Jones wears about him the grace of someone who reached maturity not knowing whether it would all work out. Plenty of actors can take a hit of Binaca tilt their good side to the camera and play at gravitas. Jones seems to actually possess it. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (Sony Pictures Classics) represents Jones debut--other than a cable TV throwaway--as a film director and it is a mixed success. As both its star and its director and with the bigger name to trade on Jones will be the inevitable public face of the movie but Three Burials owes as much of its unique character to its screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga. Arriaga is best known for the scripts to Amores Perros and 21 Grams; and Three Burials is needlessly marred by the same out-of-sequence storytelling and heavy-handed silences that helped turn 21 Grams into a portentous mess. Certainly many movies have benefited from underexposition but not every cinematic pause can be a pregnant one; and Jones--not only an actor-turned-director but (uh-oh) an actor directing himself--frequently miscalculates the degree to which a performer can carry a story (or even a scene or even an emotion) all on his or her own. Advertisement The slight narrative of Three Burials turns on the apparently senseless killing of a sweet Mexican vaquero named Melquiades. When the murder goes largely uninvestigated by the local police Jones Pete a ranch hand takes matters into his own hands. Jones inhabits Pete; he is his lifes work after all what with that scrub-covered face the growly West Texas flute for a voice the paunchy strut. As the movie makes plain the one decent thing in Van Horn Texas is the easygoing friendship between Pete and Mel; its a kind of crack in the border between El Norte and the poor country lying to the south and by the pitiless logic of Three Burials this means it is doomed. Mel shows Pete a picture of his Mexican wife and children whom he has not seen for years then obliges him with a promise Should Mel die in the United States Pete must return his body to Mexico to be properly buried. Do not bury me he pleads ""among all the fucking billboards."" I too do not particularly like all the billboards but herein lies one serious problem with Three Burials. Jones has said that the movie came about because he and Arriaga are ""hunting buddies"" and that ""Arriaga likes to make movies about his country and its history; I want to make movies about my country and its history."" Fair enough but while we see Mexican history through the lens of Arriagas pride we too often see American history through the lens of casually condescending Hollywood groupthink. Mels killer is an open secret He is shot dead by a border patrol agent named Mike Norton who as played by Barry Pepper is all American History X a kind of living embodiment of excessive force. He corrals some would-be illegals batters them needlessly then goes home and imposes sex on his wife (while shes stuffing a zucchini no less). Much of Van Horn Texas meanwhile we see through Nortons wifes eyes. She has moved from Cincinnati only reluctantly and for her the residents of Van Horn form a parade of overeating underdressed grotesques. (January Jones is quite good but speaking of billboards could we make her look a little less like an American Apparel ad please? Id sooner believe she graduated from Choate Rosemary than the school of hard knocks.) Stephen Metcalf Stephen Metcalf is Slates critic at large. He is working on a book about the 1980s. Three Burials is a movie drenched in the myth of The Crossing. It falls to a mean little place like Van Horn Texas after all to defend some strict prophylactic separation between the United States and Mexico; and it is Jones and Arriagas most intriguing observation that melting blending and miscegenation are the inevitable norm in such a place. Against that melting and blending racism lashes back as a kind of desperate defense in favor of a stable self-image. Dwight Yoakam--who plays the towns sheriff and who manages with his little pencil stache to look like a greasy ninth-grader a heap of middle-aged ruin and the sexiest man alive all in one package--reestablishes the boundaries of his world with a single word ""wetback."" ""No I dont think about the myth of the West"" Jones bridled recently at an interviewer. ""Its not the kind of thinking I do. Thats more suited to people who live in big towns on the West Coast or East Coast people who stay under a roof in a room all the time."" I dont care much about Jones image of himself as the living spirit of the American outdoors but as someone who sits indoors for 121 minutes and watches a movie that bears his name I do care about pacing dialogue ideas; and to believe the moral lesson of Three Burials you have to go along with a couple of huge leaps. The first is that Nortons wife Lou Ann so hopelessly bored by Van Horn and coming under the influence of an older slattern starts casually turning tricks the first of whom is ... Melquiades The second is that after being bitten by a rattlesnake Mike can only be saved by the herbal ministrations of ... one of the illegals he has beaten For a movie about the policing of borders couldnt this one have policed a firmer one between credibility and incredibility? Between seriousness and self-seriousness? Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Jones also stars in the layered story of friendship and redemption. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" with Tommy Lee Jones Barry Pepper Julio Cesar Cedillo Dwight Yoakam Melissa Leo Richard Jones January Jones. Directed by Tommy Lee Jones from a screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga. 121 minutes. Rated R for language violence and sexuality. Metro Meridian. Guillermo Arriagas screenplays are like puzzles with the pieces meticulously rationed; different bits and particles seem to float in the air seemingly unattached taking their own time. Like ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams"" ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" unfurls at its own pace. By its final scenes when one character movingly calls another ""son"" (with a perfectly timed pause just before the word) the puzzle is complete; stark but beautiful. Directed by and starring Tommy Lee Jones ""Three Burials"" has a deceptively laconic quality that suits Jones persona. Its a quiet Western taking place near the West Texas/Mexico border. Jones plays Pete Perkins a ranch hand whose close friend Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cesar Cedillo who plays the role in flashbacks) an illegal immigrant is found murdered. Pete fulfilling a promise to his friend embarks on a journey to return Melquiades body to his Mexican hometown -- with the border patrolman who shot him (Barry Pepper) in tow. Jones and Arriaga were inspired by a 1997 news story of a Mexican immigrant shot and killed in West Texas by a Marine. They begin the film with a jumble of time-shifting scenes and images from which a story gradually begins to take shape. The patrolman Mike has just arrived in town with his blank-eyed wife Lou Ann (January Jones). Mike skeletally thin and tightly strung has a frightening lawlessness to him; hes angry but we dont know at what. Lou Ann seeming very young and very lost doesnt understand why their lives have become so airless and lonely. ""We were both real popular in high school"" she says wistfully her voice a thin little bleat. The death of Melquiades was an accident but one that stemmed from Mikes demons and Pete tracks him down despite a cover-up by the towns sheriff (Dwight Yoakam). And the journey begins with Melquiades corpse flopped over in a saddle. Its a journey that changes both Pete who grows closer to his dead friend even as he learns his secrets and Mike a shadow of a man who finally begins to lose a bit of the wildness in his eyes. Throughout the film fine actors contribute texture through character turns Melissa Leo as a seen-it-all waitress who uses sex to alleviate boredom; Richard Jones as her husband a diner cook whos learned to look at her without seeing; Levon Helm as a blind man encountered on the journey who pleads with Pete and Mike to help him by ending his life. ""Youre good men"" he says hopefully his eyes painfully slitted shut; its almost a prophecy. Mike is not yet a good man but perhaps he may yet become one. Ultimately ""Three Burials"" is about friendship and forgiveness; about finding redemption through a journey to a new world. And its about the emergence of a new directing talent Jones in his first feature finds the right note in every scene bringing Arriagas elegant cipher to life. As the characters find a new home perhaps Jones has found one too -- on the other end of the camera.

CR Dawn Jones Tommy Lee Jones as Pete Perkins in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. CR Dawn Jones Photo Dawn Jones Tommy Lee Jones abuses a corpse in poky Western 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada Drama/black comedy. Starring Tommy Lee Jones Barry Pepper Julio Cesar Cedillo. Directed by Tommy Lee Jones. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Tommy Lee Jones directed and stars in this off-center movie about the life-enhancing personal discoveries that take place when a cowboy a killer and a corpse journey into Mexico on horseback. As satire ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" isnt funny or illuminating and as a drama it has only a few scattered moments. The border zone between Texas and Mexico is nicely evoked -- psychologically and culturally as well as geographically. But mainly the film is dreadfully slow without much in the way of rewards. Then again who knows? Maybe millions of cinephiles have been waiting for a movie to come along that shows Jones combing a corpses hair or picking the flesh-eating ants from its dead face. There may even be people who will laugh out loud when Jones sets the corpses head on fire to get rid of those ants. And by the way why didnt the fellows in ""Weekend at Bernies"" think to preserve Bernies corpse by filling him with antifreeze? In ""The Three Burials"" Jones does that for his friend and thats a laugh right there. To be fair ""The Three Burials"" has an elusive charm -- although it may elude everybody. The film starts effectively albeit in a self-consciously art-movie way by following two disparate sets of characters. Jones is Peter a cowboy who insists that the police investigate the shooting death of his friend Melquiades (Julio Cesar Cedillo) an illegal immigrant. And Barry Pepper plays Mike a newly arrived border patrolman and all-around creep who treats his pretty wife (January Jones) with callous indifference and spends days in his patrol car leafing through Hustler magazine. Gradually and skillfully Jones and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga guide us toward the realization that were seeing these characters at different periods of time. Mike the border patrolman is the one who accidentally killed Melquiades and when Peter figures that out too the movie really begins At gunpoint he makes Mike dig up Melquiades body and forces him to accompany him and the corpse on a slow trip to Mexico. He wants to bury his friend in a particularly nice spot and hes going to do it even if he has to set him on fire. For those inclined to take the movie seriously -- and that includes the filmmakers -- ""The Three Burials"" can be looked upon as the story of an older mans attempt to teach a younger man a valuable life lesson. Mike needs it. Still its difficult to see what lesson our hero is imparting. Dont get stuck in a slow pretentious art film? Forty minutes of corpse jokes just isnt funny? As a good actor Jones is alive to the nuances of communication so the moment-to-moment interaction between Jones and Pepper is rich. Jones also does a fine job of conveying that sense one sometimes gets in border towns of floating in an overlapping no-mans land with all that implies in terms of customs laws and morals. But the pace is enough to kill people and after an hour and a half viewers may start identifying with the corpse. Its difficult to direct oneself in a drama. Comedians do it all the time and that seems to work but in drama few thrive at it Clint Eastwood being the most notable exception. Jones certainly doesnt embarrass himself; he survives but with some mannerisms of recent years more in evidence than usual. For example the way he trails off a sentence with his voice faltering as though hes lost in a deep reverie -- that one is all over ""The Three Burials."" -- Advisory Gun violence graphic death and lots of corpse-violation humor.

Its won kudos at Cannes and raves for Tommy Lee Jones who directs his first feature by melding tough-Texan shtick with art-house chic. But behind the hype lies a banal morality tale told in needlessly jumbled flashbacks and gorged with gruesome atrocities out of a Sam Peckinpah flick. Since the ratings board has failed you well step in. This films R is fitting but attributing it solely to ""language violence and sexuality"" doesnt cut it. ""Sexuality"" includes a husbands rape of his wife and nothing in the description covers appalling scenes of a rotting corpse. For a cowboy buddy picture this is one grisly movie -- Don Quixote meets The Trouble With Harry en route to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Jones plays Pete Perkins a Texas rancher along the Mexico border where tensions run high. When Norton (Barry Pepper) a gung-ho Border Patrol agent kills Perkins pal Estrada (Julio Cedillo) Perkins keeps his promise to the undocumented immigrant to take his body home to Mexico. A kidnapped Norton gets to go too. With lawmen in pursuit their quest on horseback apes the last act of Lonesome Dove in which Jones Woodrow F. Call takes deceased pal Gus McCrae (Robert Duvall) back to Texas for burial. But Burials doesnt stop there. Bizarrely driven Perkins treats Estrada as if he were still alive. At night he unwraps the corpse to prop it beside campfires -- reeking and drawing ants. At another stop he shoves a garden hose down its decomposing throat to pump in antifreeze. Yet beyond such pungent punishment Burials has an artful aura. The bilingual Jones is reliably potent as a no-nonsense ol Texas boy with a streak of loyalty as wide as the Rio Grande and Pepper plays a convincing turnabout from callous amorality to sorrowful suffering. The atmosphere has a strong Texas tang with gorgeous cinematography for awesome West Texas settings. Marco Beltramis score accents it with mournful majesty. But three cheers? No way.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post At the beginning of the movie chapter titled ""The Second Burial of Melquiades Estrada"" an earth digger pounds red dirt down on the mound that marks the illegal migrants grave. Without pomp and under circumstances he intends to ignore the sheriff of a small West Texas town hurries the burial. In Tommy Lee Jones staggeringly soulful directorial debut Melquiades first burial was even rougher business. While trying to scare off a coyote slinking too near his goats Melquiades (Jose Cesar Cedillo) is shot by a spooked Border Patrol agent who had just begun a tryst with a skin mag. It is an accidental killing of sorts. Agent Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) already displayed an unblinking unthinking disconnect from other humans. Before this killing he would run down two illegals crossing the brush into Texas. Lets just say he misunderstands the call of duty. Later when wife Lou Ann (January Jones) judges him ""beyond redemption"" she will get no argument. Ranch foreman Pete (Tommy Lee Jones) believes his friend was murdered. The laws disinterest in finding out who shot Melquiades backs his suspicion. If Peppers character looks like someone fresh from basic training its because ""Three Burials"" was fed by the true story of the 1997 killing of 18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez Jr. by a Marine unit stationed along the Texas-Mexico border. It was the first instance of a U.S. citizen shot by a U.S. soldier since Kent State. Jones screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and a crew blessed with pristine vision have delivered a tale of friendship and ethics worthy of Greek tragedy. In fact Melquiades third interment is the stuff of myths remade for modern woes. Like Sophocles Antigone Pete understands the obligation to honor the dead. Not only is he bent on finding Melquiades killer hes set on giving his friend a proper burial far beyond the river in a Mexican town called Jimenez. Promise me if I die youll bury me in Mexico Melquiades asks Pete in flashback. (Pete speaks Spanish and there are subtitles throughout the movie.) Its a wistful request not a premonition. But a promise is a promise. This oath provides an opportunity to meditate on all sorts of border issues life and death the U.S. and Mexico cowboys and the rest of us. ""Three Burials"" is a visual ballad of profound loss. When Pete learns Sheriff Belmont (Dwight Yoakam) went ahead and dumped Melquiades in the ground the hurt on his lined face is pure. (In May Jones won the Cannes Film Festival prize for best performance by an actor.) Pete kidnaps agent Norton takes possession of Melquiades corpse and sets off into Mexico. On this journey to Melquiades town Pete and agent will meet a blind man (Levon Helm) who begs for an end a rattler that might deliver one even a healer (Vanessa Bauche) who may or may not dispense a cure. She has her reasons. Racism is central to ""Three Burials"" contrasting picture. ""Im awfully sorry about Melo"" someone says to Pete adding ""He was a good Mexican."" Drawing on a number of heady cinematic traditions - from Jean-Luc Godard to Akira Kurasawa to Sam Peckinpah - ""Three Burials"" remains rooted and heartfelt. Friendship may be the abiding sentiment but theres a blessed lack of sentimentality. Although the movie is about the laconic tenderness of male friendship women have their place here uncomfortable as it may be. Melissa Leo (TVs ""Homicide"" and ""21 Grams"") plays Rachel a carnal knowing waitress. Described that way she sounds like a cliche. But Leo makes her a study in survival techniques. Arriaga wrote ""Amores Perros"" and ""21 Grams."" Be forewarned that this tale doesnt always unfold with no-brainer ease. Instead the films first chapter switches back and forth with the most grace Arriaga has yet shown. And theres a biblically righteous brutality to Nortons punishment that reminds us that Arriaga remains compelled by Catholic themes. ""Three Burials"" bears witness to some of the prettiest most unforgiving terrain the desert West offers. Under cinematographer Chris Menges gaze the sunbaked wind-scoured plains and shrubby hills of Texas and Mexico are an erotic presence. From landscape to soundscape performance to performance ""Three Burials"" humbles. Indeed the goodness of this movie is everywhere to behold. ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" R for language violence and sexuality | 2 hours 1 minute | MYTHIC WESTERN | Directed by Tommy Lee Jones; written by Guillermo Arriaga; photography by Chris Menges; starring Tommy Lee Jones Barry Pepper Julio Cesar Cedillo January Jones Dwight Yoakam Levon Helm Melissa Leo Vanessa Bauche | Opens today at the Chez Artiste.

In Jason Bourne a familiar if darker tale in a post-Edward Snowden world July 29 2016 Aside from updating to todays surveillance state ""Jason Bourne"" largely sticks to the franchises familiar moves and they often dont have the same kinetic finesse they used to.

Unlike the local law enforcement Pete figures things out pronto and commandeers the man across the borderlands with his friends corpse in tow. His goal A proper burial to fulfill Melquiades last wish. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Petes odyssey takes in a fair amount of ground and along the way we are made to observe the resilience and injustices of the territorys mixed cultures. If Jones were a more accomplished director and if the relationship between Pete and his captive wasnt so schematic this movie might have been worthy of Sam Peckinpah. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Its certainly his kind of material ravaged and tender.

Its far from a great movie but the ghoulish spectacle of sleazy scruffy Warren Oates dragging a severed fly-infested head (his bounty) through the Mexican desert has always lent this Peckinpah opus a special nihilistic cachet. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada the first feature directed by Tommy Lee Jones is an unabashed descendant of Bring Me the Head. This time though its an entire corpse that gets hauled through the desert and thats not all thats being toted. So is a hefty parcel of racial correctness. In a dusty nothing of a West Texas town Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) a recently arrived border patrolman accidentally kills an illegal Mexican immigrant named Melquiades Estrada. How do we know the patrolman is a Nasty White Man? Hes married to a beautiful chicklet (January Jones) he treats sexually as if she were a stray dog he spends his idle moments masturbating to Hustler magazine and hes played by Barry Pepper (so riveting as the sniper in Saving Private Ryan) with the bulgy-eyed sociopathic sneer of a former schoolyard bully and torturer of small animals. Taking justice into his own hands Pete Perkins (Jones) a grizzled ranch foreman who was Estradas employer and friend kidnaps Norton and forces him to dig up the dead mans body. They then ride on horseback into the desert so that Estrada can receive a proper burial in his hometown. Along the way Perkins subjects his captive to periodic tidbits of abuse (at one point he gets bashed with a coffeepot) but its all to teach him a good lesson. Meanwhile the corpse fully dressed looks on rotting a little more each hour. How fun Three Burials has some savvy scenes of small-town gossip and adultery and Jones plays Perkins with a brittle sadistic force that hardens the edge on the movies sanctimony. But its still a smug lesson posing as a Peckinpah deathfest.

From its palpable rapport with the rugged Tex-Mex landscape to its simultaneously jaundiced and generous view of the human condition ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" looks and feels like the best Sam Peckinpah movie since the late maverick himself ventured south of the border. Tommy Lee Jones bracing bigscreen directorial debut which copped acting and writing awards from the Cannes Film Festival jury connects with both the head and the heart. Critical acclaim will guarantee interest among smart specialized audiences but it will take a masterful campaign by a committed distrib to muscle the film which is about half in Spanish to deserved success with the general public including the growing Hispanic market. Outstandingly realized on all levels the picture filters a harsh story of senseless and brutal behavior through a sensibility strongly attuned to the absurd humorous and illogical aspects of existence. Behind it all is a tale of redemption an insistence on the significance of all human life in a geographic and political context in which lifes value is easily and commonly minimized. Penned by Mexican screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga ""Three Burials"" is told in a fractured non-sequential way complete with chapter headings (""The First Burial"" etc.) although its simpler structurally than the two films that put the scripter on the map ""Amores perros"" and ""21 Grams."" After a brief prologue in which two hunters in the desert come upon a coyote feasting on a mans corpse pic sets up the dynamics in dirt-poor border area Cibolo County Texas. Young Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) has just arrived to work for the hard-pressed Border Patrol. Sullen and uncommunicative he does nothing to ease the transition for his uncommonly gorgeous wife Lou Ann (January Jones) who spends parts of her vacant days at the local diner where she befriends straight-shooter waitress Rachel (Melissa Leo). A woman who makes it her business to get what she wants Rachel is married to the cafe owner but is having simultaneous affairs with rugged down-to-earth ranch foreman Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) and local Sheriff Belmont (Dwight Yoakam). Pete hires a young illegal from Mexico Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cesar Cedillo) with whom he forges a strong bond while Belmont takes an expedient view of dealing with both the Border Patrol and the difficult daily issues of crime and illegals. Although crucial incidents are revealed at select moments and from different points of view the pivotal act has Mike panicked by gunfire he hears while on routine desert patrol accidentally killing Melquiades whose body he hastily buries. A resulting cover-up has the local authorities decide not to pursue justice in the case since it was ""only"" an illegal who died. Enraged when he learns of this Pete barges into Mikes home tying up Lou Ann (who as arranged by Pete had been conducting a secret affair with Melquiades) and taking Mike away in order to administer his own form of correct moral justice. The film gets down to business in the surprising vivid second half. Pete compels Mike to dig up Melquiades body and journey on horseback into Mexico where in fulfillment of a promise the cowboy will bury Melquiades in his native village near his family. This forced march which recalls aspects not only of Peckinpah but ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is necessarily brutal and bitter as Pete keeps Mike in suspense as to his own fate just as he tries to push him to full recognition of the stupidity and severity of his horrible act. The script and Jones acutely intelligent work as director and actor give the journey a full-bodied dimensionality shot through with abundant flavors. Theres the comic absurdity of Petes attentions to Melquiades rapidly deteriorating corpse which include partially burning it to kill devouring ants and brushing its hair which promptly falls out in clumps. Theres brutality in a poisonous snake bite and the beating of a young woman and unexpected poetic grace at an isolated desert cantina where a girl plays Chopin on an out-of-tune old piano. Road to the climax contains surprises of its own both for the characters and audience and payoff is richly earned. Arriagas script is so deeply conceived that even though the characters do many profoundly misguided things the viewer understands these people well enough to accept them; theres no melodramatic good-and-evil here but a range of human pros and cons hopelessly intertwined. Jones gritty clearheaded direction amplifies these qualities; its at one with the material in much the same way the life-and-death drama finds its natural stage in the desert. Reinforcing this feeling is Chris Menges widescreen cinematography which is exceptionally expressive of the rough textures of the landscapes (some of the action was filmed on Jones own West Texas ranch). Playing an iconic grizzled old-style cowpoke Jones takes him deeper investing Pete with values simple but not simplistic and navigating a path that does right by everyone in his life who deserves it. Pepper potently puts over the most problematic role -- that of a young shallow man who hasnt yet learned to properly deal with either lifes bounty (his lovely wife) or its hardships (a challenging job). Leo invests her wonderfully conceived role with a zest for life while January Jones is an alluring sympathetic vessel waiting to be filled. Yoakam and Cedillo are fine in the other significant parts.
