A group of misfit Atlanta teenagers must compete with a luscious soundtrack and some impressively trippy camerawork in ""ATL"" the wildly undisciplined directorial debut of musicvideo maven Chris Robinson. Hitching a poor-boy-rich-girl romance to some conventional drug-dealing shenanigans with a dash of last years ""Roll Bounce"" thrown in for good measure Warner Bros. low-budget stab at capturing an urban niche audience is higher on stylistic dazzle than originality or coherence making it an unlikely candidate to bust out of the box office ghetto. As scripted by Tina Gordon Chism from a story by Antwone Fisher (who wrote and was the subject of ""Antwone Fisher"" 2002) this is the sort of movie where everyone is identified by a catchy nickname a brief freeze-frame and a mouthful of introductory voiceover. First up is Rashad (Tip Harris better known as rapper T.I.) a reasonably well-adjusted black teen from Atlantas south side who has been the self-proclaimed ""man of the house"" -- a home he shares with younger brother Ant (Evan Ross) and prickly uncle George (Mykelti Williamson) -- since the untimely deaths of his parents a few years ago. Rashads buddies are a familiar but likeable bunch that includes preppy Esquire (Jackie Long) tubby Brooklyn (an immensely likeable Albert Daniels) and perpetual high school flunkee Teddy (Jason Weaver). Amusingly mismatched group spends every Sunday night jamming at the Cascade roller-skating rink where Rashad first meets a sharp-tongued beauty (assured newcomer Lauren London) whose name New New is almost as improbable as her hoop earrings. Radiating ghetto-fabulous flair on the surface New New guards a not-so-unpredictable secret. Script dovetails her dilemma cleverly with that of Esquire whose relentless social-climbing leads him to ingratiate himself with successful businessman John Garnett (Keith David). Resulting conflict if a tad schematic says some interesting things about black social mobility cultural legitimacy and the sense of pride that can readily attach itself to both the ghetto and the country club. The sweet and entirely believable romance between Rashad and New New unfortunately has to share roughly equal screen time with some flat-footed comic bits (signaled by Aaron Zigmans score which turns conspicuously wry at odd moments) and a stale subplot that sees Ant falling in with a group of drug dealers. Tonally pic never gets a firm grip wobbling between earnest sincerity and the lowbrow mockery of a blaxploitation picture even introducing peripheral characters with names like Big Booty Judy for no real reason. Robinsons direction is similarly all over the rink achieving a near-contact high in the skating scenes that is aided in no small part by Devyne Stephens choreography and Robb Buonos fabulous candy-colored production design. But for the most part helmer is content to go flashily over-the-top experimenting with varying lenses and bizarre angles rather than figuring out the ideal camera placement for a given scene. In his bigscreen debut Harris reveals himself to be an actor of charismatic reserve while Williamson also registers strongly as the oafish but sympathetic George. London is almost too feisty in her early scenes -- a choice that makes sense given her characters wavering sense of identity -- and heartbreaking in her later ones. The supremely tasty soundtrack with music supervision by Julia Michels features nuggets like Ludacris ""Georgia"" cover as well as a few tracks performed by Harris himself. Also figuring into the mix is hip-hop duo OutKast whose Antwan Patton appears in a small role. ATLProductionA Warner Bros. release of an Overbrook Entertainment production.

Pictures Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 - - Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Boys to men -- its a tough transition for these young adults in Atlanta 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ATL Drama. Starring Tip Harris Jackie Long Lauren London Antwan Andrew Patton and Evan Ross. Directed by Chris Robinson. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies about high school buddies on the cusp of growing up and going their separate ways are practically a genre unto themselves. ""ATL"" is among the better ones an emotionally charged coming-of-age saga that will make you laugh and cry maybe at the same time. The films special appeal is that while the boys are poor and black their stories transcend race and socio-economic matters. In their confusion over leaving one part of their life to move on to an uncertain future they could be the kids in ""American Graffiti"" or ""Diner."" On the weekend when the pals gather at a neighborhood rink to loose themselves it transforms into ""Saturday Night Fever"" on roller skates. ""ATL"" -- the title refers to Atlanta where they live on the unfashionable South side -- boasts winning performances from a couple of novice actors who are famous in the music world. Tip Harris better known as rapper T.I. stars as Rashad a 17-year-old whos become the head of the house since the death of his parents in a car accident. His attempt to watch out for his younger brother (Evan Ross) doesnt prevent the youngster from hooking up with a mesmerizing drug dealer who promises the good life for little work. Hes played by Antwan Andre Patton better known as Big Boi half of the Grammy Award winning duo OutKast. Are all rappers closet actors or does it just seem that way? One more music connection -- Evan is Diana Ross son. Harris is the real discovery. Hes a natural a commanding screen presence who never seems to be acting. Wise beyond his years Rashad is the gangs moral compass. His best friend Esquire (Jackie Long) whos smart enough and determined enough to get into an Ivy League college goes too far to try to secure admission. Rashad need only give him a look of disappointment to have him alter his course. Although theres a predictability to the story by Antwone Fisher (whose own hard luck story was told in a movie of that name starring Denzel Washington) theres also a sweetness that makes you forgive its by-the-numbers approach. Rashad falls for a charmer who goes by the nickname New-New (Lauren London also making an impressive screen debut) he meets at the rink. He brings her home and shows her the sketches hes been drawing ever since his father showed him his first comic strip. Their relationship is sealed when she raves about his talent. But New-New who dresses as if shes from the hood turns out to be the daughter of a hugely successful CEO who is far from thrilled to discover her with a poor boy. That somebody who is rich would pretend to be otherwise to fit in is one of the movies many revelations. This is a first film for Chris Robinson who made a name for himself directing music videos for the likes of P. Diddy Snoop Dogg and Alicia Keys. While Robinson is still feeling his way as a filmmaker -- the transitions between scenes are often bumpy -- ""ATL"" has a rhythm to it and the background music as might be expected is exceptional. According to the production notes producer Dallas Austin whose first movie was ""Drumline"" pitched ""ATL"" as a musical. He was particularly keen on incorporating the Atlanta sound. Those who arent familiar with it might feel inspired to buy the CD after watching and more to the point listening to ""ATL"" a movie with a lot to say and different avenues for saying it including singing it. -- Advisory This film contains adult language and mild sexual situations.

The guy talking is 17-year-old Rashad (rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris) who has multiple responsibilities and a few lost dreams. If you press him hell say he wants to draw for the funny pages. But his parents died in a car crash some years back and since then hes spent his days at school his nights as a janitor and his in-between times riding hard on a little brother (Evan Ross Naess) whos sliding toward a life of crime. The pair live with their mostly useless uncle George (Mykelti Williamson) in Mechanicsville Ga. where they hang with friends at the skating rink. ATL marks the second film in less than a year after last falls breezy Roll Bounce to glorify roller-skating as a nocturnal urban refuge -- a place where kids can redeem and transform their lives if only for a few bright hours. In the rink juiced by soda and the shattering thud of dance tunes they become creatures of power and grace the world outside held at a comfortable if temporary remove. In ATL the skating is fluid and sexy a choreographed expression of pubescent desire. I only wish there were more of it -- the camera rests on a few skaters then moves then rests on a few more then moves. The movie marks time with Sundays but it never dwells on them devoting itself to other late-adolescent pursuits driving partying the opposite sex and the fight to break free from the bindings of class. Harris makes a tightly coiled film debut as Rashad whose face relaxes into anger cut with resignation. He benefits from Chris Robinsons affectionate direction -- an award-winning music-video helmsman he makes his film debut here -- which teases out drama from warmly combative ensemble scenes between the protagonist and his buddies. We meet Teddy (Jason Weaver) who works at a gold-tooth shop; the bum-luck Brooklyn (Albert Daniels) who cant hold down a job; love interest New New (Lauren London) who isnt all she seems; a pair of kleptomaniac twins (Malika and Kadijah pocketing their scenes); and Esquire (Jackie Long in a small saucy role) a kid with Ivy League potential whose chance meeting with a businessman (Keith David) could be his huge break. The screenplay (by Drumline scribe Tina Gordon Chism from a story by Antwone Fisher -- yes that Antwone Fisher) is loosely based on the southside Atlanta upbringing of two ATL producers (Dallas Austin and Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins) and the film has a languid nostalgic mist that thickens with stereotype near the close. A coda is far too tidy and a little too sweet. But the film has an energy a slumped dynamism discharged by restless teens that carries the action even when it feels a trifle forced. Rashads romance with New New -- and her dirty (big) secret in another part of town -- falls flat or flatter in any case than the bristling platonic chemistry of Rashad and his pals. Theyre a likable bunch. And when theyre skating says Rashad there are ""no lies no pain and no worries about what tomorrow may bring."" amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Tommy Hilfiger via eBay Clearance Sale Extra 50% off + free...

Big Boi Keith David Mykelti Williamson; Director Chris Robinson; Author Tina Gordon Chism; Release Date Wide 03/31/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 29 2006 -- 1200 AM EST The young African-American gladiators in ATL flash the kind of fierce dental bling Lil Kim might dream about in the slammer. But the combat in this gentle ode to good pals and roller-skating nights in the bad hood is about as ferocious as a Saturday Night Fever dance-off or as dangerous as a corporate-tie-in soundtrack album. Mostly Rashad (rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris) and his buddies just wanna get their skates on hit the pinwheel- colored 80s-style rink called Cascade and blow off everyday agita with spectacular choreographed team routines. The more rink time the better As directed by hip-hop music-video king Chris Robinson from a story by Antwone Fishers Antwone Fisher the skate scenes are a blast. Its when ATL (thats home talk for Atlanta) attempts to be all genres to all audiences that the movie stumbles. While Rashad works out class differences with a ghetto-fab girlfriend who calls herself ""New-New"" (newcomer Lauren London playing a character based on TLCs T-Boz) only when she sneaks out of her familys mansion ATL also throws in a Horatio Alger subplot and an antidrug fable featuring OutKasts Big Boi as the local dealer big boi.

"ATL | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; atl ) ATL (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli For every dozen-or-so teen-based dramas about white kids there are maybe one or two similarly themed films about children of other races. So when one of the latter comes along that offers keenly observed characters involved in interesting situations its worth taking note. ATL the feature debut of MTV-weaned director Chris Robinson is such a motion picture. And like all good movies of this sort it doesnt take long for the viewer to become color-blind no longer regarding the protagonists as ""black characters"" but simply as ""characters."" ATL which expectedly takes place in Atlanta focuses on two brothers. Since the death of their parents 17-year old Rashad (Tip Harris) and 14-year old Ant (Evan Ross) have been living with their uncle George (Mykelti Williamson) who is a less-than-ideal guardian. As a result Rashad has been as much a father as a big brother to Ant. The two have different approaches to life. Rashad is a hard-worker who toils away at a cleaning job to save money for his brothers future education. Ant on the other hand is looking for flashy clothes and a cool car so he takes the ""easy"" road and becomes a gofer and small-time drug dealer for a gangsta. Outside of school Rashad hangs out with his ""posse"" Esquire (Jackie Long) who has the grades to attend an Ivy League college; Teddy (Jason Weaver) a high school drop out who works in a shop fitting customers for ""grills"" (ornamental tooth covers); and Brooklyn (Albert Daniels) a New York transplant. These four spend their Sunday evenings at a local roller skating rink where they prepare for the annual ""bragging rights"" contest. While there Rashad hooks up with New-New (Lauren London) a girl with a secret. Meanwhile Esquire connects with powerful CEO John Garnett (Keith David) in the hope he can get a recommendation - the final piece that will seal his university admission. While the story contains a lot of familiar beats the characters are fresh and exhibit solid development. And although the film eventually ventures into terrain where many urban high school dramas end up - violence associated with criminal activity - other issues are addressed along the way. The most compelling of these is the class struggle that occurs within the black community. While most of the inner city lower class are trying to find a way out one girl with a privileged background is re-inventing herself to find a way in. The roller rink a relic of the 80s that is still popular in some places proves to be the mixing pot for all different people and its where several of ATLs most memorable scenes occur. In a way this locale is to this film what the disco was to Saturday Night Fever - a place of escape where class boundaries are secondary to performing skills. Robinson has assembled an impressive young cast comprised primarily of rappers (such as Tip Harris a.k.a. T.I.) and fresh faces (newcomer Lauren London). Providing experience in supporting roles are Mykelti Williamson and Keith David. For his part Robinson directs in a straightforward manner eschewing the flashy style that has become commonplace for music video directors who make the leap to the big screen. His approach the talent of his acting ensemble and the intelligence of the screenplay make ATL an engaging experience.
