He was a crack- smoking wife-abusing trailer-trash Hells Angel who embraced a life of uncurbed debauchery. Then he found himself a new wingman a guy by the name of Jesus. He cleaned up his act replaced the studded leather waistcoats with pastel leisurewear and erected a church. But he had too much love to spread so shipped out to Sudan got hold of some black-market firearms and vowed to save the children of war. Childers (brought to life by Gerard Butler in a manner which mistakes shouting for passion) makes for an intriguing subject and his story throws up all manner of paradoxes about violent acts in the name of religion and the moral implications of charity work when it comes at the expense of your family community and country. Alas Marc Forsters film settles for balmy Cry?Freedom-style melodrama which refuses to take its slippery subject to task. And as storytelling the need to cram in facts and events makes Machine Gun Preacher feel too much like one large and needlessly glossy montage sequence.

I agree with TO reviewer that Sams change from bad guy to good guy was not really covered in much depth and I wish more time had been spent with a couple of the Sudanese characters. It was a good(ish) film all-round but you just know there was a much stronger film in there somewhere.

Apart from being a real life drama it was a thought provoking movie (though non church goers may not have appreciated how powerful these church meetings can be). It was very violent (to me) but I guess it was real which does not always make comfortable viewing.

(AP Photo/Relativity Media Phil Bray) Ilze Kitshoff In this film image released by Relativity Media Gerard Butler portrays Sam Childers the impassioned founder of Angels of East Africa rescue organization in a scene from ""Machine Gun Preacher."" (AP Photo/Relativity Media Ilze Kitshoff) They say God works in mysterious ways. In the late 90s an outlaw biker named Sam Childers believed that God wanted him to start an orphanage in war-torn Sudan. ""Machine Gun Preacher"" the movie version of Childers saga depicts him as a holy warrior wading into a combat zone with a Bible and a bazooka. But in balancing this angel on the head of a firing pin its the filmmakers who are working in mysterious ways as they never have a handle on their hero.Freshly paroled from prison Childers (Gerard Butler with a bad American accent) learns that his stripper wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has found religion. So Childers goes on a luridly violent bender with his heroin dealer Donnie (Michael Shannon). In the bloody aftermath Childers stumbles into church with Lynn and their daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll).Soon after his sketchily dramatized conversion Childers is inspired to build both a chapel for hard-core sinners in central Pennsylvania and an orphanage for children in South Sudan. Shuttling between sermons in America and shootouts in Africa Childers becomes increasingly unhinged. While he exhorts his friends and family to support a sacred cause he is aggressively hunting a rebel army that conscripts children as soldiers. The irony that both factions are led by self-described Christians gets lost in the crossfire.In telling a true story ambiguity can be an asset; but instead of mapping a middle course director Marc Foster (""Monsters Ball"" ""The Kite Runner"") veers between two kinds of falsehoods. It appeals to the conscience in scenes such as an urchins homily about hatred then it aims for the gut in grindhouse-style action sequences befitting the movies lurid title. If youd pay to see a film called ""Hotel Rwanda Maniac Manager"" you might be receptive to this mixed-message movie but skeptics should keep one eye on the exit.

Sitting around in a theater and watching Machine Gun Preacher doesnt solve anything either but it fulfills a long-standing Hollywood tradition of forcing unbelievable-yet-true stories into the same blandly inspirational mold. After all a documentary about the real very much alive Childers recounting his experiences of taking up arms and saving children in Africa wouldnt be nearly as exciting or moving as watching a bona fide movie star like Butler do it right? But Im getting ahead of myself. At the start we see Childers as he leaves prison for the umpteenth time to reunite with his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan). She has some surprising news shes found Jesus and has decided to stop stripping to make ends meet. Sam isnt keen on either idea and quickly falls into his old habits with Donnie (Michael Shannon) shooting up both heroin and drug dens in the name of a quick buck. After one particularly rough night though Sam gives this church thing a shot and soon finds himself in the Lords good graces. Just as Lynn saved Sam Sam proceeds to save Donnie before starting his own construction company finding a new home for his family building a new church for the community and then embarking on a mission to East Africa where he can repair homes and build orphanages. However the more he sees of regional atrocities the more compelled he feels to join freedom fighters like Deng (Souleymane Sy Savane) in warding off intruders and rescuing children forced into their ranks. Once Sam returns to Philly seeking more resources with which to continue helping the villagers some locals joke that hes regarded as some sort of African Rambo. He takes offense at this label and yet that feels like the movies own raison detre to combine noble drama with righteous action. To be fair the latter scenes mark an improvement over director Marc Forsters recent Bond effort Quantum of Solace but the former material often feels like a regression for the filmmaker. While even Forsters worst work has demonstrated a sense of mood and flair Preacher tends to feel pat episodic and obvious throughout. Its not as if Jason Kellers screenplay does him any favors in that regard. Despite spanning perhaps a decade of Childers life the events of the film hardly feel as such demarcated solely by the arrival of an older actress playing his daughter. When an aid worker criticizes Sams brutish tactics you can bet that hell be there to save her from harm when she could use it most and when a mute scarred orphan proves to be an unexpected companion you bet that the young boy will end up cracking his unofficial vow of silence for an eye-rolling opportunity to share the sagest possible message of love with a grown man newly crippled by doubt. The cliches fly like so many spent bullet casings seemingly excused from being just that once the usual ""true story"" disclaimer goes by. Meanwhile the aforementioned doubt faced by Childers as his philanthropic efforts begin to take a toll on his home life proves to be the most marginally interesting element of his story. Unfortunately the suggestion that this changed man hasnt really changed much - a junkie instead for a different kind of high as prone to outbursts of now morally questionable violence as he had been before - is what fuels all of Butlers shoutiest hammiest moments. Whether dressing down a banker for not giving him another loan or chewing out his daughter for wanting a limo to take her to prom while other children starve its Oskar Schindlers ""I couldve saved one more"" speech cranked up to 11 every single time. Until that tipping point his performance is a serviceable one though the gruff Scotsman still struggles mightily with pulling off a convincing American accent. He easily looks the part of rough-and-tumble biker and he appears equally comfortable with wielding a rocket-propelled grenade launcher when the occasion calls for it. For all we know the real Sam Childers would be too but lets face it - that just doesnt look as cool on a poster.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What a surprise. Its grindhouse title notwithstanding ""Machine Gun Preacher"" is a genuine drama. While there are a few scenes that could fit in a Rambo movie the film intelligently explores the impact of religious conversion on a man of explosive impulses. The story is inspired by the experiences of Pennsylvania ex-con Sam Childers (portrayed by Gerard Butler) a violent biker/drug dealer whose wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) found religion while he was in prison. She drags the reluctant ex-con to services. His baptism introduces Sam to a Christian community of fellowship and affirmation and a new kind of addictive high. With his substance abuse behind him Sam establishes a successful construction business and begins building the American dream life. He becomes a better man helping his onetime partner-in-crime Donny (Michael Shannon) to reform his life. Then Sam visits Sudan and has a revelation. He becomes consumed by the plight of child refugees Christian southerners pushed out of their villages by northern Muslim raiders. He tells Lynn that God has spoken to him and returns to build a modest orphanage. This puts him in conflict with the murderous local warlords who abduct young boys and brutally train them to be soldiers. Sam returns to his real life in Pennsylvania where he has established his own small congregation urging his followers to support his crusade. His trips to Africa grow longer his family more distant. Sams temper flares when one wealthy parishioner tithes less for Africa than Sam expects. Every standard American luxury that Sam worked for now appears self-indulgent and decadent. He cant understand why the whole world doesnt share his fervor. Sams sermons become bursts of street poetry that garble the standard Sunday pieties. ""God doesnt want sheep -- he wants wolves."" Ultimately Sam takes up arms against Joseph Konys brutal Lords Resistance Army itself a nominally Christian guerrilla organization. Sam becomes a zealot in a war with no end in sight. This avenging-angel antihero engages in firefights with the LRA that echo earlier scenes of Sams shootouts with rival pushers. Ilze Kitshoff Relativity Media Gerard Butler is a born-again ex-con who goes to war for his beliefs. Butler delivers a grand performance in a multifaceted part. Director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Quantum of Solace"") shows violence with unflinching candor and weighs the good that religion does against the bad leaving final judgment to the viewers. The last scene an aerial shot that makes Sam a speck on a vast African plain suggests that Sam is a mad prophet wandering the desert alone. Its a fitting climax for a sharply intelligent disquieting and ultimately inconclusive commentary on Gods will and mans frailties. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The good news is it isnt that movie. The bad news is its almost as two-dimensional. Inspired by the true story of Sam Childers a hell-raising biker who found religion abandoned his wild ways (more or less) and opened an orphanage in war-torn Sudan the movie paints a pretty black-and-white picture of Childerss life with Gerard Butlers Sam as a sort of born-again bouncer for Jesus. In director Marc (""Quantum of Solace"") Forsters fictionalized version of the story Sam is a tattooed soldier of the Lord separating the saints from the sinners of the world with a bullet. The Sam we meet at the beginning of the film is a violent and angry ex-con mired - by an addiction to drugs and alcohol - on a path thats bound to end badly short of a miracle. When a man thought to have been killed by Sam and his waste-product pal Donnie (Michael Shannon) turns out only to have been grievously beaten within an inch of his life Sam repents his evil ways. Before you can say ""amen"" Sam has cleaned up his act reconciling with his ex-stripper wife (Michelle Monaghan) and pulling Donnie through rehab. Soon hes building both a successful construction business and a no-frills church in gritty blue-collar Pennsylvania where hes forced to step behind the pulpit himself when the real minister doesnt show up. ""How do you find the strength to start over?"" he asks. Its a good question. Unfortunately Sam doesnt seem to know the answer. Neither does the movie. Things just happen. The Lord may work in mysterious ways but ""Machine Gun Preacher"" is downright confounding. After hearing about missionary work in Africa Sam decides on the spur of the moment to visit Uganda and Sudan. While there he is appalled to learn about sectarian violence that has turned thousands of innocent children into orphans and child soldiers. Next thing you know hes building a shelter for the kids. When that shelter is attacked by rebels from the Lords Resistance Army an ostensibly Christian militia at war with soldiers from the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army Sam takes up arms himself and joins the fight. But what fight exactly is he joining? The civil war which the film presents in only the most muddled terms involving tribal religious and geographic rivalries doesnt really interest Sam except to the extent that it affects ""his"" kids. To Sams credit he rescues - and refuses to shoot - several well-armed but underage soldiers from the LRA at one point. But he has no problem mowing down their only slightly older comrades whom he never asks for proof of age before pumping them full of lead. The problematic morality of Sams actions is echoed by the film which sees things in black and white. The arguments of the only character to question Sams choice of violence are not just silenced. The character - an aid worker whose pacifism is shown as naive - is summarily killed. ""Machine Gun Preacher"" would be a better film if it acknowledged the contradiction inherent in its title or if it worked a little harder to help us understand not just Sams miraculous conversion but his complexity bordering on obsession. It gets the bullet points of Sam Childerss life but misses the target.Contains violence obscenity sex and drug use.

Starring Gerard Butler Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon. Directed by Marc Forster. (R. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Machine Gun Preacher"" is a movie about a very tough character with a mean streak a yard long. When we first meet Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) he is being released from prison. He strolls out wearing leather biker gear and proceeds to give his wife (Michelle Monaghan) a hard time because she has quit her job as a stripper. When she informs him that she has become a Christian he gets loud and threatening and tells her that she will always be a stripper and a junkie no matter what she says. He shoots heroin robs people at gunpoint and in a particularly flamboyant moment stabs a guy about 10 times and throws him from a car. So when Sam too finds religion we never forget what is in this guy and what hes capable of. That really is the story of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" which is a study of a violent man and how his violence is directed and transmuted based on where he is and what he happens to believe at any given time. Sometimes he is a Christian sometimes he isnt. But no matter what he is something within him makes him want to stand alone in the middle of a road with a machine gun blasting guys out of a truck. He is going to do that no matter what. Related Stories ""Preacher"" is lesson in conflict conviction Machine Gun Preacher A violent character finds God The movie is based on a true story and Butler plays Childers as complicated and courageous which is by far the more interesting explanation for his behavior (the other being that Childers is forceful but weak-minded and a little nuts). As long as Butler is on screen - and he is in virtually every scene - there is something to look at and study. Butler has scored this performance so that at all times we can take Sams spiritual temperature which ranges from healthy humility and protectiveness to crazy confidence and out-of-control hostility. Most of the film deals with Sams work in the Sudan and Uganda. A missionary to Africa inspires his interest and from that point on Africa most particularly its orphans becomes a focus and then an obsession for him. This is interesting only to a point. There is a sameness about Childers African exploits a series of attacks by evil rebels followed by reprisals and skirmishes. The movie doesnt give us much to look forward to in terms of external action so we focus instead on the progress of Sams emotions Is he losing his faith? Is he getting eaten up by hatred? But even that kind of speculation is limited because of the movies reluctance to pass judgment on Sams accomplishments. Is he a hero or a lunatic? Hes possibly neither or possibly a little of both but this is the problem with making a movie about a real person. If Sam were entirely fictional the filmmakers would commit in one direction or the other and devise colorful incidents to put over that point of view. As it stands they cant. Or wont. ""Machine Gun Preacher"" is Butlers show all the way. Monaghan as Mrs. Childers does little but stand around looking nervous - who wouldnt married to that guy? - and Michael Shannon pops up in a minor role not doing much though Id rather watch him do nothing than someone else. Director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"") gives the movie the grainy look of a mid-1980s grindhouse feature which is interesting. But somewhere in the middle of this 127-minute film the energy drops out and Forster never quite gets it back. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Machine Gun Preacher is crude and ham-handed from its ridiculous title on down but it still gets to some interesting places. Based on the life of Sam Childers a Pennsylvania biker who found God and became a Christian warrior for Sudanese orphans the films mealy with good intentions and there isnt a subtle second in its 127 minutes. Instead of merely celebrating its hero as a kind of NGO Rambo though it puts the matter out there with all its untidy implications. Can you fight evil without becoming evil? ""Machine Gun Preacher is too confused to come up with a convincing answer but at least it asks the question.Its a toss-up as to whats the biggest liability the simplistic screenplay by Jason Keller Marc Forsters thudding direction or the brawny but one-note performance by Gerard Butler as Childers. When the film starts - after some East African atrocities to set the scene - Sam is tumbling out of jail and back into the junkie lowlife. Angry that wife Lynn (a miscast Michelle Monaghan) has found Jesus and is no longer working as a stripper he heads off for heroin-fueled joyrides with best friend Donny whom Michael Shannon plays with a desperate energy that feels like the real thing.Forster sluggishly follows Sams journey from degradation to baptism to a new life in construction work to a preliminary visit to Uganda and southern Sudan where Sam steps outside the missionary circuit and is horrified to witness what Joseph Kony and his Lords Resistance Army are visiting upon the people an apocalyptic reign of murder rape mutilation and mass child abduction. ""Machine Gun Preacher shows us enough to beat us into submission and propel the hero into action.Sam initially builds an orphanage in the bush but quickly realizes that providing a haven for the innocent isnt enough - hes going to have to fight off their attackers. The film clog-dances through a minefield of socio-political complexity Sam and the local freedom fighters may be up against conscripted child soldiers but conveniently the latter turn against their commanders when push comes to shove. Its the children Sam isnt able to save that drive him toward a tortured stand-off with God.Imagine what a director and an actor capable of finesse might have done with this material. As it is ""Machine Gun Preacher stumbles through its awful contradictions - the wife and teenage daughter (Madeline Carroll) Sam neglects in America while he obsesses over the helpless children of Sudan the well-off stateside donors who really dont want to hear about butchered African kids. The movie combines an unhysterical view of American evangelism with an acrid admission of its limitations. Is Sam even a Christian anymore when he goes gunning for Konys militia? He doesnt care and neither does the movie.So fine hash it out for yourselves - the line where faith becomes works and works turn amoral. ""Machine Gun Preacher engages all these dissonances but artlessly and without trusting us to think for ourselves. Its a long bloody haul with time out for rocket launchers and lost boys and the biggest lost boy is probably Sam himself. His crisis of conscience might be compelling coming from any actor other than Butler whose meat-and-potatoes performance makes the character seem less interesting than he is. When the end credits roll we see footage of the real Childers and we realize with a start that heres the charismatic screw-up we should have been following all along.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Its an NRA film festival Alas Machine Gun Preacher has loftier ambitions. Inspired by the true story of Sam Childers a biker and junkie who found his calling saving children in war-torn East Africa Machine Gun Preacher is a brawny biopic that gives action star Gerard Butler the opportunity to travel the road to holy redemption - and to shoot dope and shoot at Sudanese thugs in the process. Directed by Marc Forster (Monsters Ball Finding Neverland) the movie begins in 2003 in southern Sudan with a deadly village raid. Huts go up in flames mothers are murdered and their young sons are carted off to join the perpetrators in a genocidal civil war. Cut to a few years earlier Childers is just released from prison. His wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) is waiting for him and after a quickie in the car she tells him she has found God. He goes looking for a score. But while his old motorcycle buddy Donnie (Michael Shannon wasted) plummets into a druggie downward spiral Sam gets his act together starts a successful construction company and starts going to church too. It is there that he hears the words of a guest minister from Uganda offering a litany of carnage and strife of disease-infested refugee camps of unspeakable horror. Sam gets it in his head to go to East Africa and to help build schools shelters. The visit transforms him and soon he is back in Africa again. When he returns home he fund-raises; his business suffers and so do his marriage and family life. When his daughter asks if hell pay for a limo for the school formal he declines. ""You love them black babies more than you love me"" she says storming out of the room. It could be argued too - at least as Sam Childers is presented in Machine Gun Preacher - that he loves firing off rounds of ammunition at savage militia fighters more than he loves his kid too. When hes not busy building orphanages Sam can be found defending said orphanages from attack. Is he a man of God or a man of guns? This may have been an interesting question to consider but in the hands of Forster and his screenwriter Jason Keller (working from Childers memoir Another Mans War) the matter is glossed over. And Butlers performance all brute force and brute emoting doesnt help to clarify it. Whether hes rescuing kids and giving them a home or out in the bush in the dead of night on a mission of revenge Childers deeds are presented simply as heroic. By the end of Machine Gun Preacher its title character has become a cartoon. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Machine Gun Preacher | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; machine-gun-preacher ) Machine Gun Preacher (United States 2011) September 29 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Machine Gun Preacher uses the ""real-life"" story of Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) as the framework for a movie that is part drama part action and part social conscience. Like Hotel Rwanda it seeks to provide a human context to one of Africas most brutal civil wars. Unlike the earlier film however this one is presented from the perspective of an outsider; the horrors he witnesses give birth to a lifelong obsession to oppose the atrocities in southern Sudan. Marc Forsters film is not afraid to venture into dark places but the ending is layered with artifice and there are several underdeveloped subplots that may have been trimmed due to time constraints. The action sequences are energetic and suspenseful but they dont always mesh well with the dramatic material. First to address the veracity of the story it should be mentioned that Machine Gun Preacher is based in large part upon Childers autobiographical Another Mans War which has been accused by various fact-checkers of white washing certain events and making the writer a more heroic figure than he might have been. (The movie briefly addresses this claim when a female doctor accuses Childers of being little more than a mercenary who despite his good intentions could end up doing great harm.) Still the usual disclaimer applies Never let the facts get in the way of a (good) story. The words ""based on"" allow for a fair amount of latitude. Despite at first seeming like a friendly upbeat story of redemption of another white man coming to Africa as a savior Machine Gun Preacher displays an uncomfortable edge. Childers is a loquacious Rambo and the movie doesnt shy away from displaying his narcissistic and obsessive aspects. Hes not a typical hero - in fact it could be fair to argue that hes an anti-hero. The scenes of carnage in Sudan are disturbing and the Forsters camera doesnt flinch from showing them. In fact some might argue that they are exploitative. If nothing else Machine Gun Preacher drives home the inhumanity of the situation far better than any two-minute evening news segment can. Most people will identify Childers as an avenging angel of God - a man who protects the innocent and strikes down the wicked. But despite relying upon the mans testimony as his primary source Forster finds room for gray areas. Machine Gun Preacher strikes its most obviously false note at the end when it tries to sew up holes and wrap up things in a tidy audience-pleasing fashion. Machine Gun Preacher opens in the late 1990s with Childers a Hells Angels biker with an attitude to match the organization name emerges from incarceration having served his time but not having been rehabilitated. After having sex with his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) in a car the two arrive home where they are greeted by the couples daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll) and Sams mother Daisy (Kathy Baker). Thats when Sam learns what to him is disastrous news his wife has quit her lucrative job as a stripper because she has found God. Eventually after a close call with a homicidal drifter who nearly kills Sam and his best buddy Donnie (Michael Shannon) Sam heeds the Lords call. He quickly becomes an active evangelist building a church for hardcore sinners in his neighborhood then going overseas to Sudan to see if theres anything he can do there. After befriending Deng (Souleymane Sy Savane) a member of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army Sam believes that Jesus wants him to build an orphanage in the war torn country and to go on armed rescue missions of kidnapped children. He does so but without giving much thought to how his overseas activities impact his rural Pennsylvania family. Gerald Butlers performance as Childers is one of the best things Machine Gun Preacher has to offer. He captures the essence of a volatile man gripped with the obsessive conviction of the utter rightness of what he is doing. Butler approaches Childers like a comic book character who carries a cross in one hand and an AK-47 in the other. Hes a gung-ho individual all piss and vinegar and holy water but there are times when we get glimpses into the dark side of his soul - the parts not washed clean by his baptism. Parts of Machine Gun Preacher dont work. Most of those deal with Sams home life. His relationship with his daughter isnt as affecting as it is meant to be and most of it is developed through cute facile moments. Its a montage without the music. Likewise his friendship with Donnie has been trimmed to the point where one frequently wonders why Donnie is present. We keep expecting this secondary character to have some purpose beyond lurking in the background acting impotent but it never happens. This has the appearance of a subplot currently playing on the cutting room floor. It would be interesting to know how deeply Forster buys into Childers mythology. The way he has constructed Machine Gun Preacher hints that he may recognize a lions share of the accepted story as a tall tale. The screenplay is cinematic but not necessarily true. With less elaborate action sequences than those he oversaw in Quantum of Solace Forster allows Machine Gun Preacher to succeed on the Rambo level while at the same time offers a rudimentary current events lesson to viewers who dont pay attention to whats happening half way around the world. Looking for anything deeper is probably a mistake.

Comments click to enlarge Machine Gun Preacher Video Rated R  127 minutes  2011 Theres more machine gunning than preaching but what did you expect? Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace) this watchable biopic tells the story of Sam Childers a Pennsylvania biker who found Jesus and during a missionary trip to Africa became obsessed with rescuing Sudanese children orphaned and conscripted by the savage Lords Resistance Army. Hes a fascinating character (even in the person of Gerard Butler) but his conversion from drug-crazed bruiser to psalm-singing family man is so swift and unconvincing that the movie is hobbled from the start. It becomes more engrossing once Childers finds his mission in Africa and begins gunning down LRA insurgents at which point you begin to wonder whether his faith was ever anything more than a righteous outlet for his violence. But the filmmakers would never dare make this idea explicit; all theyre after is a shit-kicking dashboard saint. With Michelle Monaghan Kathy Baker and Michael Shannon. By J.R.

Machine Gun Preacher Director Marc Forster. Starring Gerard Butler Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon. Rating R for violent content including disturbing images language some drug use and a scene of sexuality. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Gerard Butler Its based on the real-life story of Sam Childers a former addict and biker who becomes a lay minister and devotes his life to helping the children of Sudan who are caught in the midst of brutal bloody fighting. They are maimed killed or sometimes given a gun and told to fight. Compelling stuff one might think. And told a different way it could be. But director Marc Forster moves from one thing to the next so quickly the movie plays like a two-hour-plus trailer. Something feels like its missing here even at that length. Childers (Butler) is bad news when we first meet him. Within hours of getting out of prison hes the same dangerous thug he evidently always was. His wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has found religion while Childers was away but hell have none of it --"" he wants her to go back to stripping. A fight ensues and he roars off on his motorcycle and before you know it hes shooting heroin with his pal Donnie (Michael Shannon). Soon theyre robbing drug dealers and having a grand old lowlife time. One night however Childers goes too far and almost kills a homeless man. The next day he goes to church with Lynn and thats that He is converted to Christianity he gives up drinking and drugs and he finds work. Soon he starts his own construction company. Just like that. No struggles no night sweats just redemption packaged ever so neatly. At church he hears a visiting minister talk about his work in Africa. Childers volunteers to go to Uganda to help with construction there but wants to see the fighting going on in Sudan where the Lords Resistance Army is terrorizing the country. Deng (Souleymane Sy Savane) who is fighting against the LRA takes him on a tour and Childers is stunned at the appalling violence. He resolves to build an orphanage for the children left without parents or homes in the war zone. Back home preaching in the church he built he begs for assistance and is enraged by the hypocrisy of would-be donors. When in Sudan he straps on a gun and goes and gets children in need instead of waiting for them to be delivered. A sure shot from his bad old days he becomes a legendary fighter among the Sudanese. But not everyone approves of his methods -- how is his violence different or more justified another worker wonders? Soon Childers is neglecting Lynn and their daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll) pouring every resource he has financial and otherwise into his work in Africa. Events cause him to wonder himself if he is indeed doing the right thing -- but his temper always overrides his misgivings. And -- well thats about it really. The real-life Childers is still working in Africa were told. Does he retain the same conflicts about what hes doing? Who knows? The movie just sort of ends. Butler acts the role within an inch of its life. He can be a charming presence; here he is pretty adept at being menacing as well -- in fact hes more compelling as the outlaw thug than as the Great White Hope firing off rounds in Africa. Maybe hell get his nomination maybe he wont. But ""Machine Gun Preacher"" would fare better as an in-depth documentary than as the too-easy tale of redemption Forster offers here.

"Machine Gun Preacher movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Machine Gun Preacher Man of God carnage a 1 1/2 starsSeptember 29 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticGerard Butler stars in ""Machine Gun Preacher.""Realizing (and I do believe) that it takes a village ""Machine Gun Preacher"" gives blood-soaked missionary work a bad name. It comes off like a morally unreliable story in which Gerard Butler (pictured below) saves Africa from itself. ""Some kind of African Rambo"" is how hes described inaccurately (hes American after all) but its accurate in spirit. The events of the movie may be a little bit true or a lot but hardly any of it plays that way.Heres how its subject the former drug dealer and criminal hard-case Sam Childers positions himself in his 2009 memoir ""Another Mans War."" Childers as Childers tells us was a lost man living a drug-addled rage-fueled sawed-off-shotgun life in Central City Pa. Then he found God in 1992 swept the drugs and alcohol out of his life and as part of a mission trip to Uganda helped rebuild a war-torn village.In Sudan which he first visited in 1998 Childers confronted the grisly handiwork of the Lords Resistance Army a guerrilla faction notorious for its gunpoint recruitment of male child soldiers and its abduction of young females into the sex trade. Now the founder of the Angels of East Africa rescue organization Childers built an orphanage near the Sudan/Uganda border and in his own account and the movies led a noble band of Sudan Peoples Liberation Army warriors to rescue as many abductees as they could killing when killing was necessary.Heres a quote from Childers book. Staring down an enemy he seethes ""The Lord I serve is the living Lord Jesus. And to show you hes alive Im going to send you to meet him right now"" Blam Another enemy smote.Now there are those who question Childers version of his resume beginning with the SPLA a spokesperson for which has said ""The SPLA does not know Sam Childers."" Either way my frustration with ""Machine Gun Preacher"" begins and ends with the film itself directed by Marc Forster with the same strained melodrama and synthetic emotion he brought to the screen version of ""The Kite Runner."" (Hes made a good film or two too including ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Stranger Than Fiction."").As Childers Butler is nothing but a one-dimensional rage machine. His family stays firmly in the background even when they shouldnt be in dramatic terms. Michelle Monaghan does what she can as his ex-stripper wife stuck with platitudes such as ""God gave you a purpose Sam Childers."" Kathy Baker is wasted as Childers near-mute rock-of-Gibraltar mother-in-law.The only two who register with some welcome complexity are Madeline Carroll who plays the Childers daughter as a teenager and Michael Shannon as Childers friend fellow biker and fellow user. Their performances feel vital and true. But ""Machine Gun Preacher"" which really cant wait to get to the ass-whupping part of this inspirational story lacks any real sense of how Childers underwent his staggering transformation of character. Jason Kellers script believes in the man and in the children he no doubt rescued from harm or death. But belief isnt enough and if the images of the film takes us straight back to Sylvester Stallone in the jungle then its too late for honesty.mjphillipstribune.comMachine Gun Preacher -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for violent content including disturbing images language some drug use and a scene of sexuality)Cast Gerard Butler (Sam Childers); Michelle Monaghan (Lynn); Michael Shannon (Donnie); Kathy Baker (Daisy); Souleymane Sy Savane (Deng); Madeline Carroll (Paige)Credits Directed by Marc Forster; written by Jason Keller; produced by Forster Robbie Brenner Gary Safady Craig Chapman and Deborah Giarratana.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 23 2011 Save for later Saved Gerard Butler plays real-life American Sam Childers in ""Machine Gun Preacher."" APPARATUS PRODUCTIONS/Album/Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is a Philadelphia ex-con with severe anger-management issues. Just released from prison he returns home to a familiar pattern of substance abuse and armed robbery. His wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) a former stripper has in the meantime become a devout Christian during Sams incarceration. Contemptuous of her do-goodism but sinking fast he agrees to attend church with her and is forever transformed.""Machine Gun Preacher"" based on Childerss real-life exploits sets up a fascinating story and then proceeds to make it increasingly less fascinating. Now a successful construction company owner Childers makes a relief trip to Uganda where he detours into neighboring Sudan and witnesses the atrocities of the Lords Resistance Army - a renegade militia that often turned children into rifle-toting soldiers by forcing them to kill their own parents.Soon he is providing shelter for terrorized Sudanese children. He builds them an orphanage and a schoolhouse. By comparison his life back in America where he has also become a lay preacher loses its luster. He is hooked obsessively so on saving the Sudanese children even if this means becoming a gun-toting hellion himself. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Are Childerss exploits genuinely humanitarian or just an adrenaline-fueled substitute for his earlier violence? This is the fascination of the story but director Marc Forster and screenwriter Jason Keller take the easy way out by turning Childers into a Bible-thumping Rambo. Just because the Childers of this movie is not to put it mildly introspective is no reason why the filmmakers had to be equally dense. Butler doesnt seem in any hurry to provide what the filmmakers lack. He might as well be playing well Rambo. Theres even a scene where he wades into the fray machine gun in hand wearing a black head scarf just in case we missed the connection. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Because Childers is so one-dimensional the film is particularly open to charges of bwana worship. The vast majority of socially conscious Hollywood movies set in Africa have featured whites center stage - ""Cry Freedom"" was probably the most egregious example - and this one is no exception. Even the Sudanese orphans whose plight is after all the films reason for being are presented as a grievous backdrop to Childerss calisthenics. They are poster-art children framed to elicit our maximum sympathy - as if we wouldnt respond to their plight otherwise.If you stick this film out to the end credits the real Sam Childers poses a question for the audience ""Does it matter how I bring them home?"" What he is saying is If your own loved ones were kidnapped tortured or raped would you care if I used extreme violence to rescue them? This is a legitimate and troubling question and in a more thoughtful movie it would have been the starting point not the endpoint for the drama especially one dealing with a supposedly God-fearing Christian.

"Machine Gun Preacher review Shooting blanks |       NJ.com comments Machine Gun Preacher review Shooting blanks Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23 2011 at 732 AM View/Post Comments Phil BrayGerard Butler has the lead role in ""Machine Gun Preacher"" which is based on a true story. Truth is stranger than fiction. But that doesnt necessarily make it better. ""Machine Gun Preacher"" for example is based on the life of a real man Sam Childers a charming gentleman whose great loves in life used to be heroin his Harley and the tips his wife earned swinging around a stripper pole. But then Childers was born again. He started going to church. Then he started his own church. And finally he established his own mission in Africa where he tried to minister to children being orphaned there every day by a brutal civil war. Occasionally taking a break to hunt down some of the murderous rebels and empty a couple of clips in them too. It gives a whole new meaning to ""muscular Christianity"" but just because its a real story doesnt mean that any of it feels realistic. The whole thing is awash in cultural stereotypes and cinematic cliches -- and a slightly distasteful aura of self-congratulatory righteousness. Some of that is on-screen with Sams wife staring at him with worshipful eyes and occasionally piping up with things like ""God gave you purpose Sam Childers"" Some of it hovers off-screen centering on a star who undoubtedly saw this project as a chance to ""stretch."" Perhaps thats because after catching American audiences with his lead role in ""300"" Gerard Butler has been mostly playing ""amusingly"" macho pigs in romantic comedies like ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""The Bounty Hunter."" And theres only so far that shtick will take you. So now we get this film (which Butler helped produce) -- and we get endless scenes of Butler weeping over children shooting up rebels and screaming at his congregation that theyre a bunch of sheep and he cant do this alone. (Why they keep showing up every Sunday for this abuse is one of the many questions the film cant answer.) At least Michelle Monaghan taps into some of the surprising blue-collar grit she showed in the barely seen ""Trucker."" And the always-just-slightly-askew Michael Shannon does a lot with the underwritten part of Butlers former partner-in-crime a biker who seems destined to keep finding salvation only to misplace it again. But Butler just snarls his way through the whole movie and whatever good Sam Childers has actually accomplished -- and is still accomplishing -- is lost in movie mediocrity. The filmmakers may have started with a real story here. But all theyve come up with is a real chore. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. Machine Gun Preacher (R) Relativity (128 min.) Directed by Marc Forster. With Gerard Butler Michelle Monaghan. Now playing in New Jersey.

(Handout) BY Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday September 23 2011 400 AM Pearl Jam 20 - 2 starsChronicle of the seminal 90s grunge band. Director Cameron Crowe (200). Not rated Language. At the IFC.Apparently not even one of the biggest groups of the 1990s can escape the cliche of a rockers look-back Eddie Vedder Stone Gossard and their bandmates are shocked that their opposing personalities made for a great quintet. But director Cameron Crowe -- a pal since Vedder came over from Mother Love Bone to crawl scaffolding in venues big and small -- lets them ramble on.Still this is an atmospheric capsule of a time when young Seattleans in khaki knee-shorts threw their Medusa-like hair around while wearing flannel. Kurt Cobain TicketMaster and the tragic concert in Roskilde Denmark are addressed through plentiful backstage footage. If only it was about something other than rockers almost irked they got famous.Thunder Soul - 4 starsDocumentary on a 70s high school band reuniting (125). Not rated. At AMC 25.This rousing doc produced by Jaime Foxx ought to get a big-time Hollywood dramatization toot-sweet. In the 1970s Conrad Johnson was a Houston music teacher known as ""Prof"" who gave students at Kashmere High School a sense of self-respect by turning their stage band into a top-tier soul ensemble.Known as the Kashmere Stage Band their jazz-funk sound won them awards across the U.S. and internationally. They made records and got attention and this film catches up with them 30 years later as they try to put the band back together for the 92-year-old Prof now in ailing health. Warm memories of one school under a groove and a moving ending that no screenwriter could improve upon.Limelight - 3 starsInside look at the infamous New York nightclub (142). Not rated Drug use. At Angelika Landmark Sunshine.Dont expect objectivity from this doc co-produced by the daughter of Peter Gatien the eyepatched Canadian whose Limelight Palladium and Tunnel nightclubs lit up New York in the 1980s and early 90s -- until changing times Rudy Giuliani and allegedly untrustworthy informants and DEA agents smashed his empire. Director Billy Corben employs a lot of flash to recall the wild nights and interviews with a jailed Michael Alig NYC officials and others flesh out the flashbacks. Transporting as it is this doc leaves a bad taste in your mouth if just for the ill will it drudges up.The Whale - 3 starsDocumentary about a lost whales connection with humans (125). Not rated. At Cinema Village.Filled with astounding images and opening the same day as ""Dolphin Tale 3D"" this doc co-produced by Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson is simple but involving Ten years ago a lost baby killer whale -- soon to be named Luna -- started hanging around British Columbia waters swimming up to fishing boats and making extraordinary interactions with villagers who happily pet the orca and made it their goal to help him find his aquatic family. Fears that continued human contact would prove disastrous turned out sadly to be correct. Parents should know that the ending makes the last moments of this family-friendly documentary as tough as ""Bambi."" But the lessons about friendship are gigantic indeed.Machine Gun Preacher - 2 starsAction-drama about an ex-con saving African orphans. With Gerard Butler (207). R Violence language. At area theaters.The early scenes of this sanctimonious fact-based drama is rough-hewn fun as Pennsylvania bad boy Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) gets out of prison and gets right back to his hard-livin criminal ways aided by a sleepy-eyed pal (Michael Shannon). But then it gets preachy as Sam finds God (courtesy of his born-again ex-stripper wife played by Michelle Mongahan) and becomes obsessed with using his contracting business -- and some portable artillery -- to build an orphanage in Africa and save refugee children from devilish rebels.Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Quantum of Solace"") lays it all on with a heavy trowel believing hes giving Butler a pulpit from which to confess his acting sins. While hes certainly better than in say ""The Bounty"" the result is far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In ""Machine Gun Preacher"" Gerard Butler says ""Ive done a lot of things Im not proud of that hurt a lot of people."" But enough about ""The Bounty Hunter"" ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""P.S. I Love You."" Butler plays a hell-raiser racist and ex-con who suddenly becomes an ardent Christian who goes to Uganda on an aid mission. Too easy He blows that off and heads for Sudan which as always is being scorched by a civil war. He builds churches orphanages and playgrounds while a local warlord murders kids by the truckload. The conversion of Butlers character (based on a real person though his exploits are implausible action-movie cliches) is an utterly bungled opportunity to show how a soul gets rebuilt through Christian faith. Its presented as a simple case of him showing up at church and getting baptized. He is thinly written as both a selfless do-gooder and a heroin-addicted armed robber. In Africa he preaches sermons and is forever leaping out of pickup trucks to slay snipers and guerrillas in an update of Sergeant York. Or just call him St. Rambo. The Africans are as usual in these films either victims or psychopaths meant to provide a backdrop for the heros soul searching. He wonders whether hes neglecting his children back home. Guess what? He is -- as we learn in one of the few interesting scenes when he cleans out the familys safe to pour all of his assets on the charity bonfire. By the end Sudan is still a land of blood and despair. But good intentions are all that matters to this film by ""Finding Neverland"" director Marc Forster whose intention it is to win some good awards.

It is yet another iteration of the big strong white man who comes to save legions of poor anonymous black Africans.In this case that man is ex-biker gang member Sam Childers who after getting out of prison shooting up heroin and nearly killing a hitchhiker sees the error of his ways. He accompanies his wife (Michelle Monaghan) to church is baptized and emerges a new man. Childers hears a preacher speak of his missionary work with African children displaced by civil war and offers his services to build them shelter. While in Uganda he ventures into southern Sudan and is struck by the homeless orphaned children who face the daily threat of murder.About the movieMachine Gun Preacher 1/2 out of fourStars Gerard Butler Michelle Monaghan Michael Shannon Souleymane Sy SavaneDirector Marc ForsterDistributor Relativity FilmsRating R for violent content including disturbing images language some drug use and a scene of sexuality Running time 2 hours 3 minutesOpens Friday in Los Angeles and New YorkHis compassionate instincts are sound -- to build an orphanage in the middle of this territory -- but Childers hair-trigger temper leads him to pick up arms and fight the vicious Lords Resistance Army troops who recruit child soldiers.In the process of saving these children this self-described ""hillbilly from Pennsylvania"" neglects his own wife and child back home.This is a violence-drenched movie with a clear agenda an Oscar nomination for Butler.But the role of this ex-con who finds Jesus is a caricature at best. He doesnt deserve an Oscar nod for his one-note performance and the movie is tedious grisly and too long. The story never delves into the lives of the children who are represented here almost as scenery interchangeable except for one who offers Yoda-like wisdom.A humanitarian doctor accuses Childers of being a mercenary and that title suits the trigger-happy guy more accurately than preacher.The story of a man who renounces his criminal past to help needy children is inherently intriguing. Perhaps if the role had been played by an actor capable of conveying greater complexity it could have been moving. But the way Butler plays it this is a shootem-up blood bath rather than an inspiring movie. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Machine Gun Preacher Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review Machine Gun PreacherGerard Butler stars as an ex-con who fights for Sudanese children but Marc Forsters direction lacks discipline.September 23 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Gerard Butler stars as Sam Childers an ex-con who gets religion and heads... (Phil Bray Relativity Media )You may not fear God but you best fear Sam Childers. Or at least I think thats the message of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" starring Gerard Butler and Gerard Butler (sorry but it is just that emphatically his movie) as a locked-and-loaded Bible-toting bad boy determined to take down Satan in Sudan. If anything watching the film is like attending an old-style Southern tent revival a you want to believe in the fight against all that fire and brimstone. Heck you want to join the righteous brigade. But when the lights go up and the fever dies down it feels more like youve witnessed a show than a real showdown with the devil. Still its somewhat soul-quenching to get all riled up for a good cause once in a while. Its also a reminder that even in the very capable hands of director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Stranger Than Fiction"") yet another morality tale with white man as savior of African cause is tough to pull off in this day and age even when its based on a true story as this is. Butler looking about as buff as he was in ""300"" slips easily into the skin of the very real larger-than-life Sam Childers a guy who comes with one of the great redemption stories going. Sam once mired in a biker-drug-addicted-prison life comes out on the other side to find religion. He gets into the construction trade and builds his own church (like a certain biblical figure hell try but fail to model). On a brief mission trip to Africa he finds his calling helping Sudanese children whove been orphaned or conscripted by the regions brutal rebel force. In time though the preacher finds his Bible and his hammer arent enough. To make a difference against the Lords Resistance Army in Sudan it takes an assist from a machine gun to drive home the point. At home back in Pennsylvania where about half of the movie takes place Sam proves to be locked and loaded too his emotions nearly as lethal at times as his gun. Its clear that the aching need he sees in Africa and the affluent complacency he finds in the U.S. trigger his frustration but as to what shaped him into such an angry man in the first place were never really given a clue. Having such a complicated man as a central character is a blessing and a curse for the filmmakers and the movie struggles because of this. Theres a lot of setup that screenwriter Jason Keller needs to dispense with quickly (this is his first produced screenplay to hit theaters though there are a fistful more on the way). It makes for a bumpy entry for most of the rest of the films very good but under-utilized cast a Michelle Monaghan (""Source Code"") as Lynn Childers long-suffering wife; Kathy Baker (""Cider House Rules"" TVs ""Picket Fences"") as Daisy his even longer-suffering mother; and Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road"") as Donnie his addiction-plagued longtime friend. The movie opens with Sam leaving prison Lynn waiting outside to pick him up. Despite some energetic welcome-back sex in the front seat of their rattletrap there is trouble in paradise. While Sams been in lockup Lynns been born again and has given up stripping which apparently provided the financial support for the family including daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll). Even if you buy the fact that in letters phone calls and prison visits Lynn never breathed a word of her major lifestyle changes to Sam (despite their electric connection) its a lot to stuff into a few scenes and it ends up a bit of a mess. After Forster gets us past that and Sam starts his trips to Africa the film settles down into the action-thriller in a war-torn country that is really destined to be. Even the look is richer from dense undergrowth where dark deeds happen to wide unsheltered vistas that turn the orphanage Sam builds into an easy target for the LRA. With cinematographer Roberto Schaefer (whos worked on all of Forsters films) the filmmaker gives everything to the Africa staging. Rural Pennsylvania home base for Lynn Paige Daisy and Donnie pales by comparison a both visually and in its story. There simply isnt enough time to do justice to both and so like Sam Forster chooses Sudan. A similar divide infected the directors 2007 film ""The Kite Runner"" powerful in rendering the Afghan childhood of two boys less so when examining the imprint it left on their adult lives. The Sudan side of the story allows Butler to flex his action muscles as Sam finds an outlet for the rage that always seems just under the surface even when hes trying for godly. It also puts the excellent Souleymane Sy Savane center stage. If you havent seen Sy Savane in the indie ""Goodbye Solo"" now is the time to catch up and if the Hollywood gods are with us he will soon be around for us to watch a lot more often. Meanwhile Sam as a character is a good fit for Butler always a dominating physical presence on screen A  la ""300"" a trait that tends to overwhelm and undermine his romantic comedy outings as was the case in ""The Bounty Hunter"" and ""The Ugly Truth."" Sams mission lets the actor combine the machismo with the emotion that you wondered if Butler could channel as well. He can. Butler and Sy Savane an anti-LRA fighter who befriends Sam make a good pair too a one explosive the other introspective those sensibilities balancing each other to give the film its most moving relationship. For Forster ""Machine Gun Preacher"" continues the directors exploration of the central theme found in virtually all of his work a the human spirit struggling to survive. He gives this uplifting saga all of his passion. It could have used a good deal more of his discipline as well. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWith Gerard Butler Iran film Septembers of Shiraz gains...July 2 2012The Songs Cornell goes tender for Machine Gun PreacherDecember 7 2011Decent start for Machine Gun PreacherSeptember 26 2011Machine Gun Preacher Sam Childers larger than filmSeptember 18 2011The Actors Gerard Butler Machine Gun PreacherSeptember 4 2011Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-machine-gun-preacher-20110923,0,645121.story",200,machinegunpreacher21,machinegunpreacher,latimes

The church is desanctified in ""Moneyball"" whose context is runaway commerce and whose subtext is statistics--i.e. a scientific approach to the major-league version of the game that seeks to sweep away nostalgic notions and dry the moist eyes of the faithful. Never before though have statistics added up to such electrifying entertainment. After the mostly minor-league productions of recent months this movie which was directed by Bennett Miller renews your belief in the power of movies. ENLARGE Brad Pitt as the Oakland Athletics Billy Beane in Moneyball. Columbia Pictures Brad Pitt plays--to perfection--Billy Beane the current Oakland Athletics general manager who in 2002 guided his small-market underfunded team to an unprecedented 20 consecutive wins. (He was the subject of the Michael Lewis book from which the script an inventive work of fiction based on fact has been adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin.) In that year as the film has it Billy finds salvation from the As relative poverty--relative most painfully to the filthy-rich Yankees--by putting into practice the theories of Bill James whod been preaching the gospel of so-called sabermetrics. Instead of paying lavish salaries to superstars who sometimes fail to produce needed wins the cash-strapped GM--himself an ex-player who didnt deliver on his shining promise--depends on intricately detailed computer analyses of individual performance. By doing so hes able to buy specific talents embodied by players who might otherwise be unwanted or ignored. His brainiac aide in this abstruse enterprise is his assistant general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). A young Yale-educated economist with a picture of Plato on his bedroom wall Pete knows little about baseball but lots about teasing the meaning out of equations and algorithms. ""Using stats the way we read them"" he tells Billy ""well find value players that no one else can see."" Watch a clip of ""Moneyball"" starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Courtesy Columbia Pictures. Theres nothing abstruse about the way ""Moneyball"" dramatizes the enterprise. Thanks to the elegant understatement of Mr. Hills portrayal the unworldly Pete provides a wonderful foil to Mr. Pitts eccentric flamboyant Billy in just about every scene they share. But just about every scene in the film crackles with intelligence brittle humor and edgy conflict; its not to minimize Mr. Zaillians gifts or those of the director to say that the dialogues pace and density evoke Mr. Sorkins screenplay for ""The Social Network."" Movie moments dont get much better than the staff meetings in which Billy takes on the panel of supposedly wise old executives and scouts who pick players for the As to hire (every one of them is wittily delineated) or the machine-gun-rapid succession of phone calls in which Billy negotiates with other teams for players he wants to buy. (The calls come too fast to follow in detail but theyre hugely enjoyable all the same.) Or Billys first encounter with Pete during a negotiating session with the top management of the Cleveland Indians. A relentlessly acute observer Billy senses that Pete an extremely junior member of the Indians staff is playing an almost silent but extremely important role. Confronting him later in a hallway Billy asks ""Who are you? What happened in that room?"" From top to bottom the casting is inspired. Mr. Pitt couples a star presence--theres a singular there there whenever the As general manager is in camera range--to a beautifully measured ensemble performance that makes Billy a minimalist ironist tossing off funny remarks with an abandon that almost conceals his deep anger pain or self-doubt. ""Good meeting"" he says brightly after a horrible meeting with his stern-faced field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an implacable foe of anything that smacks of sabermetrics ""Every time we talk Im reinvigorated by your love of the game."" More Baseball After Moneyball The Moneyball Myth Arts character is written rather repetitively--hes implacable and implacable and then implacable--but Mr. Hoffman as ever gives his man a special if ever-glowering cachet. Robin Wright does a brief graceful turn in the role of Billys estranged wife. Chris Pratt is affecting as Scott Hatteberg the washed-up catcher recycled by Billy according to sabermetric precepts into a valuable first-baseman. Billys daughter Casey is played by Kerris Dorsey a young actress in her feature debut whos the essence of sweet simplicity in a couple of crucial scenes. One of them is set in a music shop where Casey to her fathers boundless delight works out chords on a guitar and sings ever so tentatively. All you need know about the other with Casey behind the wheel of a car is that it serves to the films immense benefit as her exquisite loving postscript to the complex subject of her dad. The force that binds all of this fine work is fine direction. Whether Mr. Miller is dealing with the professional actors in his cast or with real-life baseball players standing in for the players and scouts of the Oakland As his touch is unerring and his narrative vision is clear. After only one documentary (""The Cruise"") and one feature (""Capote"" with Mr. Hoffman in the title role) he now takes his place in the first rank of American directors. The cinematographer Wally Pfister has already demonstrated his mastery in a string of Christopher Nolan films and won an Oscar for ""Inception""; this time he works stylishly but unobtrusively and that includes what may amount to an accidental sight gag when someone almost blocks the camera in the process of whispering in someone elses ear. ENLARGE Jonah Hill as Beanes assistant in Moneyball Columbia Pictures ""Moneyball"" was inspired as the familiar phrase goes by a true story. In fact Peter Brand is a dramatic invention and a very good one. In fact Billy Beane was not the first general manager to bring a statistical approach to the Oakland As; he continued the work begun by Sandy Alderson who gets credit in the book but doesnt figure in the film. One might also debate as my sportswriter colleague Allen Barra did in a separate Journal piece Thursday the factual accuracy of the book which may--or may not--have overstated the sabermetric case. As a work of fiction the film suffers from an energy sag toward the end by remaining admirably faithful to the odd nature of its source material. Because the Oakland As didnt get a World Series win in 2002 and because Billy Beanes life has never been blessed by the sort of conventional triumph that makes for great movie endings the films narrative pauses not once but twice while others remind the hero--and the audience--that he really did change major-league baseball and that he really does deserve to think well of himself. On the whole though the film gets many important things exactly right. It isnt about numbers be they player stats or the staggering sums spent by top-tier franchises even though the story seems at first to be asking us to root for the gimlet-eyed statistician rather than the sharp-eyed pitcher or batter; for data rather than intuition; for the cool satisfactions of science rather than the fevered romance of sport. What its really about is the old-fashioned heroism of a traditional hero in a fresh guise--a flawed guy with little to show for his 40-odd years; a smart guy who finds a way to make his smarts matter. ""Moneyball"" is a new manifestation of the old Yankee spirit though hardly in the Steinbrenner sense--a deeply American film about a uniquely American sport in which a principled guy takes on the moneyed titans because he cant stand the unfairness of what theyre doing to the game he still loves. Watch a clip of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" starring Gerard Butler. Courtesy Relativity Media. Machine Gun Preacher Sometimes the phrase ""based on a true story"" signals a failure of imagination. Thats the case in ""Machine Gun Preacher"" a would-be inspirational account of Sam Childers a drug-dealing biker thug who transformed by religious faith became a lay preacher in Pennsylvania and founded an organization to rescue children from the ravages of internecine warfare in East Africa. ENLARGE Gerard Butler as the titular Sam Childers in Machine Gun Preacher. Relativity Media The failure lies not with the films director Marc Forster nor with its impressive star Gerard Butler but with Jason Kellers dreadfully earnest script which charts the heros spiritual journey and his Rambo-esque exploits without offering a scintilla of mature perspective on his state of mind. Is Sam a saint or is he a zealot who ends up killing child soldiers on his own? Has he turned his native intelligence from a life of crime to a life of service or has he been driven mad by the suffering he finds after a casual first visit to embattled Sudan? No reason that it cant be any or all of the above but the films dramatic opacity can be maddening too. DVD FOCUS The Tree of Life (2011) ENLARGE The theatrical window grows ever narrower. On Oct. 11th Terrence Malicks exquisite and exasperating film will be available on DVD and Blu-ray (the latter format being preferable given the grandeur as well as the gorgeous simplicity of Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography). Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are a father and mother known only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien in the 1950s Texas of the filmmakers youth. Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to his characters tyranny and thwarted dreams. Ms. Chastain has few words and doesnt need them to portray a woman struggling to preserve faith in the face of incomprehensible tragedy. Cyrus (2010) Jonah Hill is one side of a triangle in this dulcetly crazy and certifiably hilarious little comedy made by the Duplass brothers Jay and Mark. John C. Reilly is John still a lost soul seven years after his divorce. Marisa Tomei is Molly who comes out of nowhere at a party he has forced himself to attend. She is everything John could have wished for--smart kind pretty and a sex angel in the bargain. The only complication is her tangled relationship with Mr. Hills Cyrus her 21-year-old son who lives at home and is to say the least seriously weird. The Savages (2007) Philip Seymour Hoffman is Jon Savage a lovelorn professor of drama in Buffalo N.Y. Laura Linney is Wendy Savage Jons sister a would-be playwright in Manhattan The catalyst of Tamara Jenkinss charmingly distinctive comedy is Lenny Savage a nasty old reprobate played with pitiless brio by Philip Bosco. By hurtling headlong into dementia Lenny forces his children to take stock of their lives. At every step of the way Ms. Jenkins puts her people through changes as fascinating in their free-form fashion as the lava lamp that holds Lenny in befuddled thrall.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In spite of the focus on salvation and the challenges of a godly life Machine Gun Preacher doesnt read as a Christian message film. And in spite of its overall plot--violent biker drug addict finds God goes to the Sudan and starts effectively fighting a war that the locals seem to be losing--it isnt a typical ""black conflict channeled through white witness"" story either. In both cases the film dodges the obvious trap by focusing so fiercely on controversial biker-turned-preacher-turned-militia-fighter Sam Childers that its clear this is his story not the Sudans or Christianitys. Preacher partially adapts Childers autobiography Another Mans War but visualizes him from the outside instead of through his own lens. In the process it expresses something neither religious-uplift movies nor Great White Hope stories tend to acknowledge the consuming frustration and loneliness that can come alongside a moral call to action. 300/The Ugly Truth muscleman/rom-com lead Gerard Butler gets a rare opportunity for real depth as Childers an angry aimless product of poverty who begins the movie by emerging from prison banging his wife (Michelle Monaghan) in their car then visiting a drug buddy (Michael Shannon) for a celebratory score. But an intense confrontation with a knife-wielding maniac plus Monaghans newfound faith leads Childers to convert battle his demons and remake himself as a successful business owner. He initially visits Africa to build homes but soon feels God wants him to construct an orphanage for the victims of Joseph Konys marauding Lords Resistance Army. And as he sees more of the LRAs work he feels a possibly less godly pull to pick up a gun and do something about it. Machine Gun Preacher periodically strains credulity with its over-the-top approach which packs a lot of incident into a small space and heightens its emotions accordingly. Director Marc Forster (Monsters Ball) turns Childers into a cartoony Rambo who dispatches nameless baddies with perfect dramatic timing and heroically saves the bleeding-heart aid workers who dared question his methods. Meanwhile the Sudans aridness and desperation are repeatedly contrasted with Americas glittering luxuries which are awkwardly crammed into Childers otherwise hardscrabble Pennsylvania town only when its time to prove a point. This is in many ways a self-serving hyperbolic story that mythologizes Childers and his life without addressing the inherent contradictions in murdering people for God. (Particularly murdering fanatics who themselves claim to be murdering people for God.) But the anguish of the situation is compelling particularly as Childers pursues his convictions with an intensity that becomes frightening and bitter both in the pulpit and in the field. The rage that haunted him as a younger man finds a worthier focus but is no more constructive than it ever was. Butler acquits himself well in a smoldering performance that embraces show-dont-tell and the obvious fragility of the world hes trying to build and protect is heartbreaking. Machine Gun Preacher is stirring when it presents Childers as a hero but it does its most impressive work when it addresses him as a flawed struggling but still determined man.

The kids Childers (Gerard Butler) helps who have been both forced to commit and witness the most unimaginable atrocities during the countrys civil war are presented here primarily as scenery--tiny trembling bodies indistinguishable from one another--or as small sages who offer wise words to the locked-and-loaded pastor when his spirits droop. Marc Forster who also directed The Kite Runner (2007) another film that packaged childrens wartime suffering and first-time screenwriter Jason Keller stage Childerss transformation swiftly Bellowing at his now-born-again wife (Michelle Monaghan) for quitting her stripping job and shooting up to Lynryd Skynyrd in the opening scenes he is soaked with baptismal water and laying bricks in East Africa in the next. Butler fulfills the showboating required of him raging at the disparity between the privileged West and the rest of the world puffing up when announcing ""Helping you kids is about the only good thing Ive done in this life."" But hes a shrinking violet compared with the real Childers seen in the closing credits gleefully strapping on guns and daring us because the film never does to question his mercenary methods.

Daily Edition Login to download Machine Gun Preacher Toronto Film Review 105 PM PDT 9/12/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An impressively heroic true-life story that unfortunately doesnt go far enough in examining its unusual hero. TWITTER Director Marc Forster tackles the highly dramatic life of Sam Childers a ""hillbilly from Pennsylvania"" who built and still violently defends an orphanage in war-torn southern Sudan. Theres almost too much story for one film in Marc Forsters Machine Gun Preacher. True stories can be like that and the life of Sam Childers is lets say not uneventful. An ex-con biker and all-around hell-raiser Sam found God and launched his own successful construction business. But he found his true ""calling"" when he built his own community church in Pennsylvania and began to preach there then had the unlikely notion to go to Sudan in sub-Sahara Africa to build an orphanage and help fight the ruthless warlords who prey upon Sudanese youths in the ongoing civil-war in Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL The biggest challenge in bringing such a life to the screen even greater than cramming in all the key incidents is to avoid hagiography. Forster and his writer Jason Keller dont completely resist that temptation. Relativity Media has plenty of marketing hooks when the film rolls out later this month and certainly critics will rave about Gerard Butlers fast-and-furious performance as Sam Childers. But one cant escape the nagging feeling that the film doesnt dig deeply enough into its real-life hero. The film doesnt explore all those ""whys"" and ""whats."" PHOTOS Toronto Film Festival 13 Films to Know Why does Sam find God? Oh sure you see him get out of stir and immediately take to his old nasty habits and realize that this life will literally be the death of him. Motive enough to quit drugs and crime for sure but why God? It could have been AA or a real job or simply his love for his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) and daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll). But since Preacher is part of the title the surrender to a higher being needs better explanation. PHOTOS The Scene at the Venice Film Festival 2011 Sam does notsurrender his impetuous headstrong biker personality though so his drive in all areas -- building a church preaching rushing off to a war zone or harassing everyone he knows for money for his orphanage -- stops just this side of mania. But why Africa? America doesnt lack for orphans or inner-city war zones. And what was it about war that Sam didnt understand? The movie portrays him as totally unprepared defensively the first time rebels attack and burn down his orphanage. The film does a better job organizing Sams chaotic life into two locations small-town Pennsylvania and the African bush and the emotional tug-of-war within Sam between these two places. This does reach a crisis point when Sam pores his familys money and most of his heart into the orphanage. Then a little orphan who has been otherwise mute gives the adult a firm talking-to and the crisis is averted. Scenes such as this -- which may not be fictional but certainly feel like they are -- are all too common in Kellers screenplay. There are other predictable scenes involving Sams junkie best friend (Michael Shannon who is always good) and family as well as moments in Sudan that act more as signposts in the evolving mind-set of the films hero than as good drama. Another nagging problem is for a film that spends so much time in Africa (production took place in South Africa) why do we spend so much time with white people? One African solider gets significant screen time Souleymane Sy Savanes Deng but his main usefulness is as Sams guide translator and confidante. He is barely a character. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is the other half of the title the Machine Gun part. Sam confidently believes in vigilantism. As portrayed he heads his own small army and wants the Godly to be warriors rather than shepherds. The film accepts this without judgment which is fair enough but you long for a moment like the one in Lawrence of Arabia where Lawrence must admit he likes shedding blood. Machine Gun Preacher nicely balances the action and drama uses its locations well and has the good grace to celebrate a relatively unknown do-gooder whatever his motivations may be. Its a solid worthy effort but doesnt like to ask too many questions.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Sep. 07 2011 1230PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Directed by Marc Forster (USA) It may have the perfect title for a lurid B-movie but Machine Gun Preacher is in fact based on a real-life story. Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) a former drug dealer and biker who found Jesus built a church and then set out to help the children of Sudan by not only building them an orphanage but even fighting rebels with yes a machine gun. Butler gives a fantastic performance as a man desperate to help in a catastrophe ignored by so many others. But Marc Forster who previously directed Quantum of Solace is constrained by reality and so is left with a story that lacks much of a satisfying climax or anything like a proper ending.
