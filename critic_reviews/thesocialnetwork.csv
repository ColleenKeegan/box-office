Is Jesse Eisenberg the New Michael Cera? (Not a Good Thing) Online Critics Early Reaction to The Social Network Like Like LIKE ""Social Network"" doesnt provide easy answers to any of the important questions it raises -- let the discussions begin ... At last a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No youll want to chew it over in person with friends for hours. When was the last time that happened? The movie would be ""The Social Network"" the highly anticipated collaboration between director David Fincher (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (TVs ""West Wing"") which has its Friday night at the gala opening of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. (The movie opens wide Oct. 1.) The complex drama about the founding of Facebook and the conflicting claims over who deserved credit for its invention lives up to the hype. ""Social Network"" is smart lively well-acted and -- this is key --  raises questions and issues that are both timeless and totally of the moment. Oh sure you probably spent time palavering after seeing ""Inception"" this summer but that was trying to figure out just what the hell actually happened. How many dream levels were there again? And why were they mucking around in all that snow near the end? In a way ""Social Network"" seems almost a throwback to the great movies of the late 1960s and 70s. It taps into the zeitgeist. Its about whats happening now. Right now. And it has a viewpoint -- well actually a bunch of them. In the same way that ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Godfather"" were all provocative films so is ""Social Network."" Like those earlier movies (but without the torrent of bullets and actual blood) it raises questions about whos good whats right and the definition of success in America. ""Social Network"" begins in late 2003 with dweeby 19-year-old Harvard-ite Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) getting dumped in a noisy bar by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara). He goes back to his dorm room begins drinking and writes vicious hurtful things about her on his blog including revealing her bra size. Classy guy. Immediately afterward on a tear he hacks into the Harvard computer system and creates a site called Facemash. It features the faces of two female students side by side and viewers are asked to rate which one is hotter. Within hours the site has received more than 20000 hits and crashes the Harvard server. Its Revenge of the Nerds writ small. Soon it becomes Revenge of the Nerds writ large. Zuckerberg socially inept but always the smartest guy in the room goes on to conceive the idea for Facebook the now global social network that has made him into the worlds youngest billionaire. Or does he? Because success has many fathers while failure is an orphan there are competing claims for Facebooks founding. While no one argues that it was Zuckerbergs brains and programming skills that built the system he later faced legal challenges from other Harvard-ites who claimed they too had been there at the social networks birth. These competing claims both in the deposition room and in flashback make up the heart of the movie. One comes from Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) a fellow geek and Zuckerbergs self-described best friend who provides the seed money for Facebook. The second lawsuit is filed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss twins who are everything that Zuckerberg and Saverin are not socially skillful preppy and successful athletes. (They rowed crew at Harvard and later in the Olympics.) The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg ripped them off after following the Facemash incident they approached him about designing a dating website that would trade on the Harvard name. He instead strung them along even as he was frantically building Facebook. Basically Zuckerberg as written and portrayed here is a brilliant jerk. He is so driven by his vision that it outweighs any social or ethical considerations. He creates the worlds most successful friend finder but ends up friendless just as he started. Theres something very American about all this. Who owns an idea? Is it the person who first has it? The person who runs the farthest with it? The person who finances the dream rather than the dreamer? And what is the cost of success? Those questions are timeless. The new ones ""Social Network"" also raises are about the internet and the speed with which it can spread information both true and false. As the ex-girlfriend whom Zuckerberg so nastily disses in his early blog post later tells him when he tries belatedly to apologize ""The internet isnt written in pencil Mark. Its written in ink."" What I like most about the movie is that without ever actually articulating them aloud it raises all these questions about innovation idea ownership capitalism friendship loyalty and the reach and scope of the internet. Theyre just there existing almost as invisible subtitles in a viewers mind. Even better ""Social Network"" doesnt provide easy answers to any of the questions it raises. Let the discussions begin.

It launches us headfirst into an intense exchange between two students Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) sitting in a Harvard bar opposite each other nursing beers. You can hardly call it a conversation. She speaks smartly and normally; he avoids eye- contact talks through her responds selectively and when the chat doesnt go his way needily asks Is this real?Its a brilliant scene on its own because it says so much about the filmmakers spin on Facebook founder Zuckerberg and the limits of interaction that his invention seeks to plaster over and in the context of the work as a whole because it tells us straightaway that this is a film about a creeping void between people whether or not theyre lovers enemies business partners or Facebook friends. Its a savvy prologue to a story of how a perfect storm of social inadequacy Ivy League exclusivity and computing genius inspired a global phenomenon.The film makes its case instantly that Zuckerberg is a social disaster and sticks to that line as it moves from the wood-pannelled college dorms and snowy cloisters of Massachusetts to the trendy bars and hip offices of Palo Alto CA. We meet Zuckerberg as he develops various student sites until he hits on TheFacebook.com which he runs with friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who is more suave less awkward and the bridge between Zuckerberg and Harvards exclusive student clubs - a world from which he feels bitterly excluded.As Facebook grows Zuckerberg moves to California seduced by the real-world nerd-made-good charms of Napsters founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake smart casting) who offers Zuckerberg informal membership of another club a world of investors by day and parties by night. Not that Zuckerberg is a party animal; he just likes to feel part of something like Facebook users browsing photos for vicarious pleasure.Eisenberg gives a storming performance as Zuckerberg complementing his geeky clothes (hoodies flip-flops) with a perma-deadpan voice wildly roving eyes and a jolty physical presence. Hes full of contradictions socially awkward but confident; ignorant of commerce but ruthless in business.Essentially the film is a series of flashbacks built around more recent legal shenanigans the two depositions that resulted from accusations that firstly Saverin was unfairly ousted from Facebook and secondly that Zuckerberg stole his idea from two Harvard contemporaries the Vinklevoss twins (Armie Hammer eerily plays both). These meetings and Zuckerbergs unco-operative presence at them give the film a sober framework but otherwise its a chronological tale fast furious and funny.Theres no escaping that The Social Network sticks the knife into Zuckerberg and milks for all its worth the irony of a disconnected soul connecting the world. We should be cautious and remember this is Fincher and Sorkins spin on the truth grounded in fact but stretched and moulded to suit their themes. But what makes the film more than a witty well-performed hatchet job thats plugged cynically into the technological zeitgeist is that despite the fun of the parties the intrigue of the legal wranglings and the humour of the dialogue Fincher and Sorkin never let us forget that were complicit in their story (or at least 500 million of us are). If as the film argues Zuckerbergs values are mirrored in Facebook what does that say about us? If we jab our finger too wildly at Zuckerberg all well get is a very sore eye.

Plus The pale Bergmanesque vampires of Let Me In. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 4 2010 ShareThis Chloe Grace Moretz in Let Me In.  (Photo Saeed Adyani/Courtesy of Overture Films) D avid Finchers business saga The Social Network is a Make Your Own Zeitgeist picture. Its protagonist Facebook creator and worlds youngest billionaire Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is either an emotionally dysfunctional monster incapable of maintaining a friendshipmaking his invention of a tool to facilitate friendship too-too ironic and that tool itself deeply suspector the guy you really really wish you were no matter how twisted and reviled he may be. See Also  Is The Social Network Really Scathing?  Sorkin on Mentally Disordered Blog Commenters  Whats Jesse Eisenbergs Value in Hollywood? I find both options reductive and from what Ive read of Zuckerbergs life dubious but the movies lustrous deep-focus frames and headlong pace are difficult to resist. Its an entertainingly cynical small movie. Aaron Sorkins dialogue tumbles out so fast its as if the characters want their brains to keep pace with their processors; they talk like they keyboard like Fincher directs with no time for niceties. The first scene is a tour de force of disconnection. Zuckerberg sits across from his girlfriend Erica (future hornets-nest kicker Rooney Mara) and holds forth at triple-speed on the injustice of being ignored by Harvards elite clubswhich bus in college girls using the come-on Party with the next Fed chairmanwith such bilious urgency that Erica who likens dating him to dating a StairMaster flees. Thats the heart of Sorkin and Finchers Facebook Creation Myth It was all to get back at the girl who dumped him and the Wasps who wouldnt let him join their clubs. Fincher has likened The Social Networks emotional trajectory to Citizen Kanes in that its protagonist becomes simultaneously more successful and more friendless. But Finchers direction is so cool and depersonalizing that the story has no emotional heft. Zuckerbergs Wasp adversaries are cartoon boobs. More than once the camera scrutinizes young women from behind appraising them as the movies horny young voyeurs do. The Trent ReznorAtticus Ross score is in some Eno-airport no-mans-land of its own. Every!thing is disconnected from the get-gotheres no humanity to lose. Eisenberg has been until now a hugely likable actor with an instinct for thinking and fumbling in character. As Zuckerberg hes been whipped into monotony. Fincher directs like a drill sergeantMamet with an overwound metronome. The only actor here allowed to give a fully rounded performance is Justin Timberlake as Napster co-founder Sean Parker whose sleazy hustle turns out to be just what the burgeoning Facebook needs. Fincher does get the details though the ubiquitous energy drinks that seem to fuel the movies hyped-up jittery pacing; the programmers in headphones deep in their antisocial trances writing code to connect us all; the oak-and-crimson Harvard vibe illuminating the ties between arrogant undergraduate high jinks and arrogant alumni high jinks. (Harvard president and Inside Job villain Larry Summers is played with peerless superciliousness by Douglas Urbanski.) What The Social Network isnt about is well the social networki.e. Facebook and what it means for the culture. The real Zuckerberg may have a dismaying unconcern for privacy but from the start he had a vision that Facebook would help create communities in an ever-insular world. The movies final imageZuckerberg friending the woman who dumped him and endlessly refreshing the page to see if she acceptsis presented as pathetic irony. But you could also read it as a sign of hope. In the Facebook world which is now ours a new communication infrastructure exists with no avenues definitively closed. T he poetic Swedish vampire picture (with arterial spray) Let the Right One In has been hauntingly well transplanted to the high desert of Los Alamos New Mexico and renamed Let Me In. The tale of a scrawny 12-year-old outcast (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who drifts into an indelible relationship with a girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) in a cloak who doesnt come out in the day its bathed in a pale orange winter light that gives the barren landscape an unearthly glow. Michael Giacchinos score is full of shivers and plinks ghostly chorales and shuddering strings Its the most suggestive music for a horror film in years. Director Matt Reeves misses only one aspect of the original. The Swedish girl is androgynous adding resonance to the theme of forbidden love whereas Moretz is positively sultry heavy-!lidded hollow-eyed with fashion-model cheekbones. Shes quite a vision of death though. Ingmar Bergman would have followed her anywhere. T he sounds began early at the New York Film Festival screening of Inside Job Titters of incredulity hoots of derision then a sort of audible trembling. Was the audience watching a sci-fi disaster in which pompous fools ignore the approaching onslaught? Noand yes. Inside Job tells the story of the economic collapse of 2008 and its the horror movie of the decade. As he proved in his Iraq-centered No End in Sight policy wonk turned documentarian Charles Ferguson has no peer when it comes to tracking the course of a preventable catastrophe. No Michael Mooreish grandstander he strives for a tone of objectivity; the drama is in whether hell be able to hold his emotions in check. Its impressive how long he goes before the signs of disgust and indignation creep in. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Review The Social Network an extraordinary look at the founding of Facebook - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview The Social Network an extraordinary look at the founding of FacebookBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 09/30/2010 120000 AM PDTUpdated 01/21/2011 093951 AM PSTClick photo to enlarge L-r Andrew Garfield as ""Eduardo Saverin"" Joseph Mazzello as ""Dustin Moskovitz"" Jesse Eisenberg portraying ""Mark Zuckerberg"" and Patrick Mapel as ""Chris Hughes"" in Columbia Pictures ""The Social Network."" <<12345>>You will know ""The Social Network"" is something very special from its first scene.You are plopped down in a Boston restaurant in the fall of 2003. On one side of the table theres Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) then a Harvard student but soon to be the co-founder of Facebook. On the other side theres Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) a Boston University coed hes been dating.What follows is a verbal knife fight between two smart people (one Zuckerberg arguably smarter than the other or anyone else in the room) throwing out rapid-fire lines that cut and slice. Its a dazzling piece of writing that ends with Erica setting the tone for the movies view of Zuckerberg. Movie showtimes info Case 39 A Film Unfinished Freakonomics Let Me In The Social Network You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger Waiting for Superman Interviews with the stars hot new trailers When she finally dumps him Erica takes Zuckerbergs hand and looking into eyes says ""Listen youre going to be rich and successful. But youre going to go through life thinking that girls dont like you because youre a nerd. And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that wont be true. Itll be because youre an asshole.""With that Zuckerberg storms back to his dorm where drunk he creates something called FaceMash an internal website that compares photos of two coeds and urges viewers to vote on whos hot and whos not. It is huge success -- and will get him in trouble with the Harvard administration and pretty much offend every woman on campus.Advertisement It will also lead directly to the creation of Facebook the social networking site that has revolutionized the way we communicate and made Zuckerberg one of the youngest billionaires in American history. But at least in the film version of events the line from that night in the dorm to the present-day Facebook of 500 million friends and a company valued at 23 billion is not clean or tidy. Rather it is a murky tale with as many ""truths"" about who created and built the site as there are protagonists.The conflicting ""Rasho- mon""-esque views of who was betrayed in this grab for power recognition and (ultimately) money forms the core of ""Social Network."" It is brilliantly written by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") with his usual mix of rapid-fire humor smart verbal exchanges and exploration of big ideas. Director David Fincher (""The Fight Club"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") gives the film a breakneck pace trusting the audience to keep up with the onslaught of images and words. And a very good mostly young cast not only manages to keep up with Sorkins dialogue (not the easiest thing) but create fully realized characters. Thats particularly true of Eisenberg who gives a nuanced award-worthy performance as Zuckerberg.If youve been following the tense battles between Facebook and the filmmakers that led up to the movies release you know that Zuckerberg is less than pleased with the way he is portrayed obsessive single-minded dismissive often insufferable. Erica is not the only one to refer to him in disparaging terms.But Sorkin has gone out of his way to create a story (it is a dramatization not a documentary) where everyone involved is right -- and everyone is wrong. The film is anchored by a series of scenes involving depositions in two lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg and the very first words spoken in the earliest of those scenes come from Zuckerberg ""Thats not the way it happened.""The line is the key to what Sorkin has in mind. The writer gives Zuckerberg due credit for his genius and his vision of what social networking could be. But Sorkin also pays due attention to the views of those who became roadkill under the wheels on Zuckerbergs drive to the top.Theres Eduardo Saverin (a very good Andrew Garfield) perhaps Zuckerbergs only real friend at Harvard and the co-founder and first CFO of Facebook. He is perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film but also the one who makes the biggest mistakes utterly failing to grasp the big picture. Theres Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss -- blond handsome athletic twins both played by Armie Hammer with the help of some amazingly subtle special effects. They had an idea of a social site for Harvard students and thought they were hiring Zuckerberg to execute their idea.Zuckerbergs version ""They had an idea. I had a better one.""And then two-thirds of the way into the film up pops Sean Parker the co-founder of Napster who seduces Zuckerberg with sex drugs fame and venture capital. As portrayed by a splendid Justin Timberlake he is the dark side of the tech world though he too in the end gets thrown under the Zuckerberg bus when he becomes too much of a liability.Ultimately Sorkin and Fincher trust their audience not only to keep up but also discover the ""truth"" of the story on their own. The filmmakers neatly avoid Hollywood trappings or the need for a happy ending. That may be their greatest gift at a time when the American film industry is obsessed with action action and more action -- all preferably in 3-D. This is an extraordinary perhaps defining film which deserves the comparisons its been getting to the truly great movies of all time.The Social Network  Rating PG-13 (for sexual content drug and alcohol use and language)Cast Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake Rooney Mara and Brenda SongDirector David FincherRunning time 2 hoursPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Like many Hollywood movies ""The Social Network"" turns on a battle. Only the one that launches this years most daring drama is one of will and wit. And if we are to trust the on-screen clash it fueled the creation of Internet behemoth Facebook. Delving into the disputed origin of the social-networking giant comes off as just the right cinematic endeavor for the time. In this regard ""The Social Network"" shares creative DNA with a handful of classic zeitgeist-savvy films like ""Network"" and ""All the Presidents Men"" as well as more recent fare such as ""The Insider"" and ""Michael Clayton."" Americans are obsessed with connecting to others but for the life of us we cant seem to get along. Turns out neither could the folks who lay claim to Facebooks inception. The battle begins as a night out for college students Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara). How it ends sends Zuckerberg back to his Harvard dorm where the computing whiz downs beers and bangs out with a little help from his pals a site called Facemash. But first he posts a few churlish radically immature riffs about Erica. Facemash which places photos of two coeds side by side so users can vote on whos best-looking receives so many hits so quickly it crashes the harvard.edu site. Your tuition dollars at work. For filmgoers craving terrifically crafted relevant stories the movies talky whip-smart beginning declares a great deal of good news. First director David Fincher continues to crank up his game. The maker of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Fight Club"" refines his already deft gift for the visual and sonic with a demanding relationship to actors. Hes known for obsessive takes. Writer Aaron Sorkin -- creator of ""The West Wing"" scribe of ""A Few Good Men"" -- crafts tart exact exchanges that unfold in a movie that is essentially the weaving of three civil lawsuits. At the heart of all the intellectual property depositions lie the questions Where exactly did the idea and capital for Facebook come from and who should be beneficiaries of its overwhelming success? The film is based on Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires."" Sorkins handling of the conflicting truths of Zuckerberg best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and twin-towering elites Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss is a trifecta to behold. Melancholy at times amusing in a dark fashion and always fluid ""The Social Network"" follows Zuckerberg as he turns his one dear friend into a legal foe relocates from the East Coast to Silicon Valley and propels a clever notion into a company valued in the billions. The Winklevosses and Div- ya Narendra (Max Minghella) approached Zuckerberg with an idea for a Harvard-only social site after Facemash hits. For all his ambitions Zuckerberg doesnt appear motivated by money or even power exactly. That said much is made of the young mans desire to be tapped by Harvards most exclusive ""final clubs"" and his resentment at not being chosen. Pop star Justin Timberlake portrays Sean Parker. Creator of Napster the music downloading -- and busted -- website he arrives like a rock star. Zuckerberg is smitten Saverin beyond wary. Eisenberg depicts his character as intellectually cocky emotionally distant and impossibly human. While Eisenbergs is the first name youll commit to memory he is not alone in delivering a ""who knew?"" performance. Timberlake confirms his on-screen stature hinted at in indies like ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""Alpha Dog."" In a film short on warmth Garfield is an oasis as Saverin. And followers of the Lisbeth Salander sagas can breath a sigh once they see what Mara -- cast as the hacker extraordinaire in the Finchers upcoming version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" -- is capable of onscreen. Its an irony much mentioned that the emotionally disengaged Zuckerberg would invent a site that has linked some 500 million humans across the globe. But the origin-story of the site takes on a vivid life of its own here. Does the poisonous atmosphere around Facebooks birth damn the enterprise? If a young jerk -- underscore young -- creates a terrific tool does that tool become suspect? It would be nice if all artists were sincerely decent human beings. And make no mistake geeks of Zuckerbergs caliber are artists. Alas we appear destined to struggle with the vexing relationship between creators and their creations. But then this is what the better movies do arguably one-upping the best websites They connect us to our present moments predicaments. They compel us with characters not quite lovable but utterly recognizable for their hurt and hubris. Oh yeah and they do this in a way that feels escapist but is fully engaged.

"Social Network The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; social-network-the ) Social Network The (United States 2010) October 01 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Website development as a blood sport - thats what it comes down to. The Social Network shows that when pet projects are at issue nerds can get as nasty and dirty as the most skilled backstabbers and double-dealers. The film which is a joint product of respected director David Fincher and equally respected screenwriter Aaron Sorkin accomplishes its multiple goals create a gallery of fascinating fully realized characters; chronicle key events in the development and growth of todays most influential social networking site Facebook; and explore the blurred lines that exist in the amorphous on-line environment where concepts like intellectual property are involved. The Social Network is rich with food for thought but the reason it captures the viewers interest for more than two hours is because its story of friendship and betrayal is as old as traditional society and is presented with tremendous skill. You dont have to be a Facebook member (I am not) to enjoy what this movie is offering. The source material for The Social Network is Ben Mezrichs The Accidental Billionaires. There are two notable things about the book which is allegedly the distillation of countless interviews put into narrative form. The first is that Mezrichs primary source is Eduardo Saverin so it is understandable that events are slanted toward his point-of-view (a fact brought out publicly by Mark Zuckerberg who refused to cooperate with Mezrich). The second is that the acknowledgments mention Scott Rudin (one of The Social Networks producers) Kevin Spacey (an executive producer) and Sorkin perhaps indicating that a movie deal was in the works before the book was published. Thats how hot this property was deemed to be - the bigger Facebook became the more intense the interest in the story of the men who created it and the controversy surrounding its birth. The Social Network is structured as a series of flashbacks provided to illustrate testimony being given in depositions for two separate trials in which Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was involved during the second half of the 2000s. Although the movie occasionally returns to the legal proceedings set in or around 2005 most of it is a fairly straightforward chronology of events that spanned the period from October 2003 through September 2005. When we first meet Harvard student Zuckerberg hes having dinner with his girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara). What transpires during that dinner will change the course of Zuckerbergs life. Erica weary of his obsession with status decides to break up with him and when he doesnt take it well she calls him an ""asshole."" He returns to his dorm room gets drunk solicits the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and codes a website called ""Facemash"" that rates the ""hotness"" of Harvard women. The sites nearly instant popularity crashes the Harvard servers. In addition to earning Zuckerberg six months of academic probation Facemash makes him a celebrity geek. He is sought by twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Josh Pence and Armie Hammer) to design a dating website. Instead however Zuckerberg takes the kernel of the Winklevoss idea and goes in another direction in the process cutting them out altogether. Thus is born ""The Facebook"" which becomes a huge hit on the Harvard Campus. Soon it is expanding to other high prestige schools and thats when it attracts the attention of Napster creator and all-around player Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) who wants to get on the inside. Seans involvement alienates Eduardo but provides Zuckerberg with access to enough capital to elevate Facebook from a do-it-himself dorm room project to a worldwide phenomenon. The Social Network closely follows the timeline as set forth in The Accidental Billionaires. Few of the historical events presented in the book are in dispute although the ""slant"" given to some has been hotly contested by Zuckerberg among others. Nevertheless in both the written version and its cinematic interpretation the story can be said to represent a reasonable account of how Facebook came into being. Its genesis is fascinating in large part because of how cavalierly Zuckerberg goes about assembling the pieces and putting it on line. It is clear the idea is not wholly his but because he develops the code and puts in all the work he believes himself to be entitled to full ownership. Thus one of the key questions raised by the film is what constitutes intellectual property theft. Or to be more blunt did Zuckerberg steal Facebook? Zuckerberg as represented in the movie is a multi-faceted individual. This is not the ""hatchet job"" that has been reported in some media outlets - it shows the good the bad and the ugly. Like many highly intelligent people Zuckerberg is often uncommunicative intellectually arrogant and socially awkward. He does not have many close friends and invests himself entirely in the Facebook project. At times he is oblivious about why people are angered and offended by his actions. The movie offers the possibility that Zuckerberg could be far more Machiavellian than he seems (for example did he set up Eduardo with the school paper?) but there are only hints of this. For the most part we see Zuckerberg as someone whos riding a wave. For those who would argue that he has no conscience there are plenty of instances when the look in actor Jesse Eisenbergs eyes argues the contrary. Eisenberg one of those young actors who has existed just below the radar for several years now (he was the lead in both Zombieland and Adventureland not to be confused with one another) deserves an Oscar for this dead-on portrayal of a temperamental genius. The role is ripe for caricature but Eisenberg humanizes his character. Zuckerberg whose recent media appearances have made him easy to dislike is brought to life with sympathy and even-handedness. The Social Network does not shy away from the damage he has done to others but it resists representing its protagonist as some sort of technological anti-Christ. Credit for this should be equally divided among the trio of Eisenberg Fincher and Sorkin. The other actor to draw deserved acclaim for his work is Justin Timberlake whose Sean Parker is a beacon of energy and charisma even if it is all skin-deep. Although some might scoff at the pairing of ""Timberlake"" with ""Oscar"" one sitting through his portrayal of Parker will dispel negative preconceptions. Its not really a surprise though - Timberlake was good in two previous acting jobs (Black Snake Moan and Alpha Dog). Its just that his prior noteworthy performances occurred in low-budget low-exposure projects. Sorkins screenplay includes humorous interludes (including a hilarious exchange related to a Bill Gates appearance at Harvard) but it is a comedy only in the Shakespearean sense. (Shakespeares comedies are often more depressing than todays tragedies.) The dialogue is crisp and clean. Finchers presentation provides viewers with a you-are-there feel getting us into the dorm rooms parties and a rental house in California. If theres one question The Social Network is unable to answer its how a website that fundamentally does so little (although it is cleverly packaged) could become so huge. Perhaps the answer lies in a single line expressing the goal of Facebook ""to provide the college social experience on-line."" In the Internet era thats what its all about - staying connected in a virtual universe where physical interaction is increasingly becoming secondary. Much will be written about whether The Social Network is unfair to the real Mark Zuckerberg but that seems to me to be a red herring. This is a narrative feature based on a true story not a documentary so expectations of real-world veracity should be taken with a grain of salt. The character of Mark Zuckerberg as represented by Sorkin and Fincher is fascinating and his journey is compelling involving as it does so many aspects of the electronic era human experience friendship obsession big ideas betrayal and lots of money. This is the 2010 Oscar seasons first drama to live up to the hype and expectations associated with it.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 01 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Dec. 13 2010 404PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English It has the staccato wit of a drawing-room comedy the fatal flaw of a tragic romance and the buzzy immediacy of a front-page headline all powered by a kinetic engine typically found in an action flick. And thats just the opening scene a pre-credit sequence that neatly sets the tone and the theme for everything that follows. There in a college bar a modern phenomenon betrays its mundane roots A guy gets dumped by a girl. He is brilliant and nerdy; she is pretty and sensible. Soon he will invent what she and 500 million others like her now routinely use to mark their place in the world their identitys home page. But the inventor of something so new is left to play the role of someone so old - yes the emperor has no clothes and the founder of Facebook has no friends. Such is the asocial premise of The Social Network writer Aaron Sorkins and director David Finchers provocative foray into the young life and litigious times of Mark Zuckerberg the Harvard code monkey who clambered in a few short years to the billionaire rung of the Internet ladder. But back in his dorm room in 2003 Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is just a jilted loser on a vengeful mission. Wearing his trademark uniform - shorts shower sandals and a protective girdle of steely sarcasm - he sits down at his computer to design a sexist site where the college girls can be ""ranked"" according to their student photos. Called Facemash it proves instantly popular enough to earn him a stern reprimand from the Harvard authorities and a warm invitation from the Winklevoss twins - the villains of the piece or perhaps its victims. Upper classmen the twins are everything Zuckerberg isnt rich popular jocks and frat boys extraordinaire. They approach him with a vague idea for a social website confined to the campus. The monkey departs to write the code but never returns; instead he creates a much vaster network connecting all the Ivy League schools and then expanding westward. Maybe theirs was the acorn maybe not but Zuckerberg definitely grew the oak. Five years later in a panelled courtroom the lawsuit erupts. ""He stole our site"" charge the Winklevoss accusers. A little older a lot richer but no less sarcastic Zuckerberg counters with ""A guy who makes a new chair doesnt owe money to everyone who ever built a chair."" So the battle is joined and the film has its structural conceit inter-cutting between cause and effect the creative act and its destructive aftermath between former friends and lasting enemies. Metaphorically of course that structure nicely echoes the broad paradox not just of the information age but of any seismic advance in technology - the certainty that great gains come at the expense of painful losses. Or as a lawyer aptly puts it ""Creation myths need a devil."" Happily that metaphor is never didactic or less than entertaining. Ditto for the devil who thanks to Sorkins pen and Eisenbergs performance is an intriguing bundle of mixed messages. Coldly mean-minded one second simply maladroit the next hes a computer simultaneously blessed and cursed with imagination a hard-wired guy with a vision that proves both his making and his undoing. The supporting cast is just as good notably Andrew Garfield as Eduardo another classmate turned litigant the CFO of the fledgling Facebook who depending on whom you believe either couldnt keep up with the companys growth or got betrayed by its growers. Among the latter is none other than the infamous Sean Parker the brains behind Napster and here as portrayed by Justin Timberlake an erstwhile nerd who has learned a lesson apparently lost on Zuckerberg - how to convert his filthy lucre into guiltless pleasure to relish what money can buy while still respecting what it cant. How accurate are these portraits? Dunno and dont care - let others try to sift the fact from the fiction. What matters on the screen at least is our own guiltless pleasure which Sorkin ensures with his eloquently fast and comically furious dialogue. Maybe thats why Fincher on the surface an unlikely director for this material is so completely at home with it. In courtroom or dorm room hes masterful at energizing a very wordy script putting the fiery into the rapid-fire exchanges and transforming what could have been a dry legal spat into a verbal Fight Club. Okay on occasion the boxers seem to be punching over their weight and beyond our credulity. Thats a problem with much of Sorkins work. Whether American politicians ( The West Wing) or TV jocks ( Sports Night) his characters often sound too eloquent for their roles - in fact they can all start to sound like a suspiciously articulate pack of Aaron Sorkins. Yet the pack bays so wittily and bites so trenchantly that his biggest sin is also the easiest to forgive. In that sense The Social Network makes a virtue of its vice; by contrast the social network makes no such distinctions - like all explosive technologies its virtues and its vices are all of a dictatorial piece.

Following its violent beginnings the film--based on the hunt for the serial Zodiac killer who haunted the Bay Area in the late 1960s and early 70s--contained no shootouts or car chases or fisticuffs and boasted one of the talkiest scripts in recent mainstream cinema. Yet its 150 minutes flew by as if they were half that the clinical police procedural as narrative wind sprint. MORE ON The Social Network Benjamin Mercer Does The Social Network Get the Internet Right?Kevin Fallon With The Social Network a New Subject for Aaron Sorkin YouthBenjamin Mercer Beyond The Social Network Best Movies About the Internet Following his interesting (if only intermittently successful) detour into curatorial biography with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Fincher has now completed the lesson he began with Zodiac it turns out that the onetime director of Alien 3 and Se7en can keep us on the edge of our seats without any murders at all. The vehicle for this validation is Finchers latest film The Social Network which tells the story of social-media goliath Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg. We first meet Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) as a sophomore at Harvard in 2003 in the process of being dumped by his girlfriend Erica. (This is what in fables of geek superherodom is called a ""creation myth."") Mark is brilliant and inept needy and condescending hyper-confident and pathologically defensive--traits that tumble out atop one another like Keystone Kops exiting a squad car. Over the course of a few minutes his hopscotch patter lights upon and then abandons such motley subjects as Harvard final clubs the crew team and the number of genius IQs in China. Bemoaning the exhausting elliptical nature of their interactions Erica (Rooney Mara) tells Mark ""Dating you is like dating a Stairmaster."" Little wonder she decides to step off. Mark returns to his dorm room to get drunk and blog unpleasantly about his ex but soon his inebriated malice expands into a broader exercise in misogyny as he plucks photos of Harvard co-eds from a variety of protected servers--no mean feat--and sets up a website where onlookers may make head-to-head judgments on their relative hotness. The stunt captures the attention of the college administration but also that of a pair of identical-twin blue-blooded jocks Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played in a neat bit of cinematic sleight-of-hand by Armie Hammer) who enlist Mark to help them build a university-wide social networking site. Inspired by the Winklevosses idea--or less charitably stealing it--Mark secretly begins designing ""The Facebook."" (How quaint that definite article like a reference to Madonna Ciccone.) The rest as they say is history.That history is told by means of a framing narrative in which Mark is deposed for overlapping lawsuits one by the Winklevosses--or as he refers to them ""Winklevi""--and the other by his former best friend and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). Its a perfectly reasonable device though hardly a necessary one we already know whodunit (Mark) and more or less whathedun (screwed his partners out of their claims to Facebook) and theres nothing particularly notable about howhedunit.But if the movies architecture is classical its individual scenes have a sleek modernist flair. The script adapted by Aaron Sorkin from Ben Mezrichs The Accidental Billionaires has all the conversational panache for which the West Wing creator is known. But here again credit must be shared by director Fincher who imbues scene after bickering scene with the kind of headlong momentum one associates with action thrillers. In my review of Zodiac I commented on the directors knack for ""verbal choreography"" for capturing the kineticism of words thrown back and forth and this gift is on still more prominent display in The Social Network. Beginning with Eisenberg (here enjoying the role of his young career at least until someone inevitably casts him as the lead in a Woody Allen biopic) the entire cast--including Justin Timberlake who plays Napster co-founder Sean Parker as a kind of sleazy Svengali--deliver their lines with deft aplomb. Its as though Fincher has found a formula for turning any actor every actor into Robert Downey Jr.By nearly all accounts Fincher and Sorkin have taken liberties with a number of narrative details though I leave these to interested parties to sort out. There are occasional false steps along the way--for instance a misplayed bit of comedy involving Eduardos stalkery girlfriend--and the film slows somewhat in its final act as Marks dynamic blend of insecurity and aggression recedes into passivity. But The Social Network is easily among the strongest films of the year to date and proof that Finchers directorial verve can imbue virtually any tale with urgency be it the search for a killer or the search for a killer app. Jump to Comments About the Author Latest Video The Democrats Message of Calm The Atlantics Molly Ball explores Hillary Clintons image of composure in the midst of a troubled country.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The knockabout beginnings of Facebook gets a fast-paced spin in the new movie The Social Network. By Peter Rainer Film critic October 1 2010 Save for later Saved Justin Timberlake (l.) and Jesse Eisenberg are shown in a scene from The Social Network. Merrick Morton/Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Social Network"" about Mark Zuckerberg and the knockabout beginnings of his creation Facebook is a prime example of an op-ed movie - a film so topical it transcends mere movieness.Does this also mean its great? Well no although you wouldnt know it from all the advance critical hoopla. Most movies are unconcerned with the real roiling world of commerce and communication. ""The Social Network"" by contrast depicts the Facebook enterprise as like it or not a cosmic cultural shift.Director David Fincher and his screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (creator of ""The West Wing"") loosely adapting Ben Mezrichs nonfiction book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" are not uncynical about the ways in which this enterprise and its instigator racked up the betrayals on the road to glory. More often than not Mark comes across as a soulless savant. (A more accurate title for this film might be ""The Revenge of the Nerds."") Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? FACEBOOK FACTS Hollywood fiction Four things the move got wrong Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? These jaundiced filmmakers are nevertheless awed by the system that made Facebook possible. ""The Social Network"" is a warts-and-all celebration of visionary capitalism and of the moxie required to realize the vision. Mark is both the unlikeliest and likeliest of heroes - or more precisely antiheroes - for our time. Hes a wolf in geeks clothing.The problem is the geek in question at least as Jesse Eisenberg plays him doesnt have the emotional expansiveness to fill out a movie. Perhaps sensing this the filmmakers play out the story line from multiple points of view and crowd the stage with a pageant of voluble supporting characters. At times Mark seems like a bit actor in his own fantasia and although this dramatic ploy is no doubt intentional it makes for a rather unwieldy (and overlong) odyssey.It begins in the fall of 2003 when Mark having just been dumped by his girlfriend and licking his wounds retreats to his Harvard dormitory and hacks into the universitys computers to create the site Facemash - a database of all the women on campus. Photos are lined up two at a time and users are asked to choose who is ""hotter."" The site is instantly so popular that Harvards entire system crashes.From these unseemly beginnings is born what eventually becomes Facebook which quickly spreads beyond Harvard to become a global phenomenon. Along the way Mark who drops out of college after his sophomore year to run the business from Palo Alto Calif. inevitably runs a gantlet of accusations and recriminations.He alienates his closest friend and Facebooks cofounder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who sues him and is likewise sued by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss identical twin Harvard BMOCs who with a whiff of WASP-ish disdain claim Mark stole their idea. (In an amazing feat of filmic prestidigitation Armie Hammer with the assistance of Josh Pence as a body double plays both brothers.) He also attracts the attentions of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) who functions for Mark as a cross between Svengali and Eddie Haskell.Fincher periodically intercuts his straightforward chronology with deposition scenes involving Mark and both Eduardo and the Winklevosses. In flashback he presents ""Rashomon""-style versions of what really happened and leaves it up to us to sort out the truth or truthiness of the claims.From a legal standpoint this is probably the only way that the filmmakers could have told this story without getting sued by everybody under the sun but it also conveniently absolves them from taking a stand on the Facebook hoo-ha one way or the other. Since Mark is presented as a human cipher anyway the deliberate ambiguity of the flashbacks registers as just one more blur in a fuzzy landscape.The filmmakers trumpet the irony that an essentially friendless dweeb - the ""Mark Zuckerberg"" they created for this movie - founded the worlds preeminent aggregator of friends (or to be more exact ""friends""). But why is this such a surprise? If Mark had a raft of real friends he probably would not have felt the need (or had the time) to create a social-network engine. The virtuality of his life gave rise to the reality of Facebook.Despite the whiz-bang topicality the headlong intelligence and the many sharp collegiate scenes - a testy meeting between the Winklevoss twins and Harvard president Lawrence Summers (Douglas Urbanski) is a classic - this new-style movie hews pretty closely to an old-style playbook. The filmmakers have talked it up as a classic story of friendship loyalty betrayal and jealousy but with the exception of Eduardo the cast of characters - beginning with Mark - are all aggressively one-dimensional. I scrutinized their scrimmages rather than becoming emotionally invested in them.The filmmakers were probably thinking of Orson Welless Charles Foster Kane when they created their own soulless mogul. They even provide Mark with his own version of ""Rosebud"" the key that supposedly unlocks his psyche. Mark it seems created Facebook to get back at a girl he still pines for in the end. This faux Freudian soppiness is a disservice to Marks rapacity but still it gave me pause How many other jilted geniuses are out there poised to unleash their newfangled networking whammies on us?

By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Social Network check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunesor directly with our RSS feed. The Social Network The wave of curiosity hyperbole and hype ushering The Social Network (Columbia Pictures) into its opening weekend is a phenomenon that irrespective of the movies merit seems worthy of note. Listening to the debate--is it the best movie of the year or merely very good? A narrowly focused biopic or a sweeping portrait of a generation?--Im struck by how ready people are for films that are big and smart and ambitious and compassionate how tired we are of being condescended and marketed to. I know I sometimes feel like ccing a memo to all the Hollywood studio heads Please stop throwing flaming robot cars at me then asking for an Oscar. Just give some money to some smart people with something to say and let them make a movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. So is The Social Network the best movie of the year or merely a very good one? Who knows--its barely October yet. But what a joy to sit in a theater and be engaged surprised challenged amused. The bloggers comparisons to Citizen Kane are over the top (and when director David Fincher mentioned the two films in the same breath at an event he was clearly joking). But thematically and structurally Finchers eighth film does owe something to Orson Welles masterpiece. Both chronicle the progressive isolation of a young brilliant arrogant business tycoon and both have a complex temporal structure that cuts among three or four separate timelines. The Social Network wants to be a social satire a miniaturist comedy of manners and a Greek tragedy; it bites off a lot at times more than it can chew. But even the unmasticated morsels are pretty tasty. Aaron Sorkins brisk witty screenplay is loosely based on The Accidental Billionaires a tell-all book by Ben Mezrich that narrates the ascent of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) from unpopular Harvard sophomore to unpopular world-renowned mogul. The book dramatizes the testimony of Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) Zuckerbergs classmate and the first CFO of the company who was frozen out of all but a fraction of his shares just as the site went global. But in Sorkins retelling the movie revolves around Zuckerberg a socially autistic status-obsessed joyless dweeb whom Eisenberg refuses to make likable. This scorched-earth likability strategy is one of the films boldest gambits because even as an anti-hero Zuckerberg offers no traction. Hes the black hole at the movies center yet we somehow dont hate this needy young man--without caring for him as a person we care about him as a character. Advertisement The scripts refusal to pull punches begins with the first shot. Before the studio logo has faded from the screen were already hearing Mark Zuckerbergs voice his manic insistent uncharming voice as he sits in a campus bar one night in fall 2003 lecturing his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) on the importance of getting into the right final club a frat-like social organization at Harvard.  ""I have to go study"" she hedges clearly eyeing the lifeboats. ""You dont have to study"" he shoots back. ""You go to BU."" Mark is such an abrasive snob that its a relief when Erica dumps him in the unkindest terms. But then the camera follows him back to his dorm room and we realize that Erica may be free but were stuck with this guy. Drunk in his dorm room that night Mark hacks into the university mainframe and puts up a misogynistic prank site that goes viral. Within a year and a half hes created a social-networking platform thats poised to explode and hes being sued by two separate parties at once. Make that three One litigant is Eduardo Saverin and the other two are the Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler (played by Armie Hammer blended with body double Josh Pence in a nifty feat of digital technology). The Winklevosses or as Mark contemptuously refers to them ""Winklevi"" are suing him for intellectual property theft; the idea for Facebook they claim came from a dating site they hired Zuckerberg to design for their final club. The Winklevi are this movies Achilles heel; their subplot provides some of the films funniest moments and also a few of its unfortunate bouts of self-seriousness. Theyre paragons and parodies of Harvard tradition blond WASPs who row crew and frolic with European royalty. Their encounter with then-Harvard President Lawrence Summers (Douglas Urbanski) is a dryly funny delight. But a scene where we see them pulling oars on the Thames in slo-mo as the soundtrack plays a modern arrangement of Griegs ""Hall of the Mountain King"" is the movies biggest ""Why?"" moment. I think it was meant as a mock-heroic exploration of the Winklevosses outsized self-regard but it plays like a scene from Chariots of Fire. Still Sorkin and Fincher do an impressive job of making activities that are inherently dull to watch--typing at a computer keyboard sitting in a deposition room--seem not only interesting but urgent. And not just by punching scenes up with suspenseful music (though theres a bit too much of that in the first half) but by building characters and ideas with incremental care. After an hour of nimbly leaping among timelines we feel we know not just Zuckerberg and Saverin but a lot of minor characters too including Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the Faustian founder of Napster who lures Zuckerberg from the Ivy League to Silicon Valley in a terrific nightclub scene shot in lurid neon tones. As has often been the case in Finchers films the female characters are less well-drawn than the men--when Saverins girlfriend (Brenda Song) wigs out on him we have little sense of who shes been up to that point and a lawyer played by Rashida Jones feels like a mouthpiece for exposition. Maybe its enough of an endorsement of The Social Network to say that as soon it was over I wanted to watch it again. Eisenberg is extraordinary--he should get an Oscar but wont precisely because he refuses to engage in Oscar-baiting hamminess--and Garfield is just as good in his performance as Zuckerbergs spurned partner and only real friend a proxy for the audience who keeps trying to warm up to this inscrutable reptile. Im not sure whether the movie amounts to anything more than a very well-done character study with a gloss of zeitgeisty relevance. It might though. To his credit Fincher never signposts the irony at the films center That the medium of our newfound global connectivity was invented by a guy with a total inability or unwillingness to connect. Does that tell us something about Mark Zuckerberg or something about ourselves? Also in Slate Nathan Heller explains how The Social Network misunderstands Harvards culture. Luke OBrien details the factual inaccuracies in The Social Networks depiction of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebooks history. Plus Predict how much the movie will earn at the box office. Correction Oct. 1 2010 The sentence originally referred to a frat-like social organization at Harvard as a ""finals club."" It is known as a final club. (Return to the corrected sentence.)

The writer West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin churns out patter-happy exchanges between characters that always seem to have an ideal zinger at the ready. The director David Fincher is a lord of dark materials including a couple of serial-killer dalliances (Se7en  Zodiac ). Somehow the results come together like the perfect status update. Sorkins hyper-articulate characters including the anti-social social networking tycoon Mark Zuckerberg keep the words flying. Finchers sense of menace aided by a slow-burning Trent Reznor score connects with a shadowy world of Ivy League status jockeying and cold-blooded courtroom jousting. For a movie structured around legal deposition scenes The Social Network is wildly entertaining even if it asks us to follow a character arc that never quite comes into focus.The first scene finds an obsessive Zuckerberg fretting to his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara soon to be spotted in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) about his place on the Harvard hierarchy. Her response ""Dating you is like dating a Stairmaster."" Handed his walking papers Zuckerberg races home to Kirkland House starts pounding back beers and pulls the hacking prank that will soon lead to friending poking and the bizarre world of fantasy farming. (No I dont want to help you fertilize your crops. But thanks for thinking of me).Once Facebook becomes Facebook everyone wants a piece. That includes Marks bilked best friend Eduardo Saverin (future Spider-Man Andrew Garfield) the closest thing here to a good guy and a pair of swell-set undergrad twin jocks (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) who hired Mark to create a Harvard dating site and then seethed as he blazed his own trail. In The Social Networks world Facebook is like the ""great whatsit"" of Kiss Me Deadly or the Maltese Falcon. Its Hitchcocks MacGuffin the object that catalyzes a tale of jealousy ambition and betrayal.Fincher working with cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth keeps things dark and hazy especially amid the social Darwinism of Harvards exclusive social clubs. Kirk Baxter and Angus Walls editing slices nimbly through time and space from campus parties and dorms to deposition room to the Palo Alto party-computer coding palace where Zuckerberg falls under the sway of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake waltzing away with several scenes as a Silicone Valley womanizer and business shark). The craft level in The Social Network is through the roof.The word ""Shakespearean"" has already been bandied about in relationship to The Social Network which is based on Ben Mezrichs fast-and-loose nonfiction book The Accidental Billionaires . This seems a bit hyperbolic; I doubt King Lear will be coming back to claim his piece of the pie. But the classical storytelling elements are firmly in place as are the trappings of Horatio Alger. The movie is whip-smart about class with Zuckerberg cast as the social climber who knifes his way through the silver spoons on the strength of his guile.I just wish The Social Network wasnt quite so glib. Sorkins onslaught of perfectly timed perfectly conceived verbal thrusts and parries can be lulling if never boring. Perhaps this can be explained as a reflection of Zuckerberg portrayed as a guy who never cared who knew he was the smartest guy in the room. Hes the man who created the great whatsit.

Starring Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake Brenda Song Joseph Mazzello Rooney Mara Andrew Garfield Max Minghella Trevor Wright Dakota Johnson Stream Director David Fincher Running time 200 Release Opened Oct 1 2010  Editorial Review A universal story thats hard not to likeBy Ann HornadayFriday October 1 2010""The Social Network"" is the kind of movie that by all rights shouldnt work. A verbose compendium of scenes of people talking to one another largely in college dorms a Palo Alto ranch house or a law office conference room ""The Social Network"" has another thing not going for it Its centered on computers the kiss of death of modern cinema that fatally smothers visual dynamism with dull close-ups of laptop screens and mouse clicks. But when a talky movies talk has been written by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") and those words have been animated by the visual brio of director David Fincher what looks on paper like a static series of dead-end conversations comes to life as a vital engaging even urgent parable for our age. As the dramatized story of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who invented the site in 2004 while a Harvard sophomore ""The Social Network"" cant be taken as the literal record of events -- which ultimately involved Zuckerberg being sued by his partners and competitors. Clearly Sorkin and Fincher had higher aspirations for their film. With surgical precision exhilarating insight and considerable storytelling flair they make Zuckerberg both a metaphor and a lens through which to understand contemporary culture. The rhythms and rhymes of ""The Social Network"" establish themselves in the films small masterpiece of an opening scene when Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara the new Lisbeth Salander for all you ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" fans) trade barbs over beers in a Cambridge pub. Prickly defensive always five steps ahead Zuckerberg is clearly peeved that his date pines for guys who row crew. Hes brilliant but clueless putting Erica down because she goes to Boston University but painfully aware that he cant get into Harvards elite final clubs. He may be a programming genius but hes an emotional idiot. When the conversation goes fatally south and the girl breaks up with him he responds with what has become the mantra of his generation ""Is this real?"" What ensues is a narrative that hews closely to classic American tales of ambition ingenuity competition and betrayal; ""The Social Network"" has understandably been compared to ""Citizen Kane"" in its depiction of a man who changes society through bending an emergent technology to his will. But with its leitmotif of striving resentment and cherchez la femme the story also evokes Fitzgerald at his most longing and elegiac. A modern-day Jay Gatsby the ""refresh"" button on his keyboard standing in for Daisy Buchanans flashing green dock light Zuckerberg -- or at least Sorkins version of him -- embodies all those timeless contradictions and of-the-moment tics (the hoodie those flip-flops) that make for a classic literary anti-hero. Eisenberg delivers a deceivingly accomplished performance in the tricky role of Zuckerberg whose recessive withholding persona is completely at odds with the larger-than-life charisma such characters usually demand. Within an ensemble that includes Andrew Garfield as Zuckerbergs erstwhile partner Eduardo Saverin Josh Pence and Armie Hammer as the brothers who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea (and who ahem row crew) and Justin Timberlake as the Mephistophelian Sean Parker Eisenberg manages to make his nerdy protagonist the most interesting guy in the room even at his most awkward and antisocial. And that finally is the most powerful paradox that propels ""The Social Network"" whose title is clearly intended for maximum irony. As Sorkin and Fincher masterfully bring viewers along on an infectiously giddy journey of discovery and invention they also manage to infuse Zuckerbergs story with meaning beyond his own achievements struggles and flaws. Mark Zuckerberg may not be larger than life but thanks to this swift smart beautifully crafted film his on-screen avatar gets to impart truths that always will be.Contains sexual content drug and alcohol use and profanity.

L-r Jesse Eisenberg Brenda Song and Andrew Garfield in Columbia Pictures ""The Social Network."" Photo Merrick Morton Columbia Pictures Image 4 of 4 Review The Social Network 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Social Network Drama. Starring Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield and Rooney Mara. Directed by David Fincher. (PG-13. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director David Fincher has given us severed heads in boxes (""Se7en"") and serial killers (""Zodiac"") but if you really want to feel creeped out see ""The Social Network"" his new film about the founding of Facebook. The people here are scarier and a lot more threatening. A sense of unease slips in during the opening scene. Its 2003 and 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg is having a beer with his girlfriend. On the surface the conversation is funny the comedy turning on the contrast between her normalness and functionality and his strangeness. Zuckerberg is played by Jesse Eisenberg who usually plays likable nerds but we soon catch on that what he is playing here is anything but likable. On the contrary this young man is angry and mean spirited cold and condescending and he seems unable to connect with anyone. He is utterly repellent. ""The Social Network"" is not a documentary. It is a dramatization Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkins take on recent history adapted from Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires."" In an interview Sorkin has said that Zuckerberg emerges in the film as a kind of ""tragic hero"" which is exactly what you would say if youd just portrayed a billionaire as barely a human being. But make no mistake whether the movie is fair or horribly unfair - I know nothing of the actual facts and cant make that determination - its portrait of Zuckerberg is a hatchet job of epic and perhaps lasting proportions. Of course the girlfriend dumps him so what does he do? He goes home gets on his blog and writes about her breasts on the Internet. He says shes padding her bra. We watch and feel angry and disgusted but also a little afraid because we get the message that this goes way beyond one young mans immaturity and stunted moral nature. Fincher and Sorkin are saying something powerful and terrible that in the years since that day the social world has to a large degree configured itself around the contours of that one young mans neurosis. We talk about ""viral"" as though the metaphor doesnt mean anything not realizing that nothing goes viral like actual sickness. That act of cruelty to an ex-girlfriend would be repeated a millionfold by others on Zuckerbergs invention Facebook. This is a heavy message to set down in the first minutes but the movies tone is light and the focus is on advancing the story - actually two stories. Shifting back and forth through time were shown how Zuckerberg created Facebook with the financial backing of his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). And we get the story of the lawsuits that followed Facebooks success. In a sense this is a movie about an inventor and how he invented something with a half a billion users worldwide. Yet there is irreverence and a distance in the relation of this saga that you could never imagine in a movie about Thomas Edison Alexander Graham Bell or the Wright brothers. Implicit in the tone is the idea that what is being created here is of no benefit to humanity but that rather this is something useless catering to dark or at least trivial aspects of human nature like narcissism and the desire to be cool. As Zuckerberg Eisenberg does not give us a one-note creep but someone who is always gauging and assessing from behind his walled-off surface. We never doubt his brilliance. His idol worship of Napster creator Sean Parker - played with great and persuasive charisma by Justin Timberlake - is conveyed by a simple widening of the eyes and steadying of his focus. As portrayed by Garfield Saverin emerges as the movies lone sympathetic figure though the screenplay balances this somewhat by suggesting that all of Saverins ideas for the company were bad that he didnt have the vision. Though clips and coming attractions might lead one to expect a movie about pool parties in Palo Alto much of ""The Social Network"" takes place against the brown brick of Harvard and across shiny tabletops in law offices.

Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 1 2010 1201 a.m. ET In the course of a preface thats set in the mythic past--seven years ago when Facebook was only a gleam in Mark Zuckerbergs eye--a young woman tells Jesse Eisenbergs Mark that dating him is exhausting ""Its like dating a StairMaster."" Watching ""The Social Network"" is like getting a runners high without a treadmill or sweat. This account of Facebooks founder and of the websites explosive growth quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration and pretty much keeps you there for two hours. Audio Social Network Has Friends Critic Joe Morgenstern gives the movie and cast glowing reviews. David Finchers film is devastating as biography--an unfriending of epic proportions--and dazzling as contemporary cultural history. The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his supersmart and superbly funny screenplay on a contentious book Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires"" so everything thats seen isnt necessarily to be believed. (And it may be accidental that the subject chose the week before the movies release to announce his gift of 100 million to the schools of Newark N.J.) Yet Mr. Eisenbergs performance feels like revealed truth while youre watching it and given the pace of change that the story reflects his character will enter the culture as a consecrated archetype by tomorrow evening at the latest. Watch a clip from ""The Social Network"" a film about Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. On screen the Harvard undergraduate who became the worlds youngest billionaire is the most anti of antiheroes since Travis Bickle or maybe Raymond Babbitt from ""Rain Man."" (The latter comparison pops out of a scene when Mark turns away from a meeting and declares with bizarre detachment ""Its raining out."") This Mark combines a borderline autistic affect with a single-minded focus on a beautifully simple idea and a mouth-brain connection that spits out words--eerily astute words often used in angry phrases--at hyper-hip-hop speed. During his days at Harvard hes as much a stranger to others feelings as he is a Mozart of computer programming so its no coincidence that his seminal addictive and immeasurably profitable concept a network to link friends with other friends ad infinitum starts out as sexual taxonomy--an online scheme called Facemash using college girls faces to rate whos hot and whos not. Those who arent addicts or dont use the site at all--Id call myself a cautious user--may be tempted to see Facebook as a not-so-hot notion fanned into incandescence by narcissistic adolescents with nothing better to do than tell one another who they are in terms of what they like what they buy and where they go. But the script makes a convincing case for Mr. Zuckerbergs awareness from the start that hed be tapping into a deep human need for friendship at a time when physical and spiritual isolation was on the rise. Facebook really was the once-in-a-generation idea the movie keeps saying it was and ""The Social Network"" is fully equal to the challenge of dramatizing the Big Bang that brought the site into being. More Speakeasy The Social Network Review Revue (09/30/10) Justin Timberlake on Why He Doesnt Use Facebook (09/28/10) Social Network Goes to Harvard (09/27/10) For Facebook Movie Damage Control (09/24/10) Zuckerberg Plans 100 Million Donation (09/23/10) That includes plenty of sex drugs and rock n roll--girls getting wasted while their brainiac boyfriends write code. Sean Parker the co-founder of the file-sharing web site Napster must have taken no exception to Justin Timberlakes blithely scandalous portrait of his younger self since he hasnt filed a lawsuit and he must have been delighted--I know I was--by the nimble humor and dancers grace of Mr. Timberlakes portrayal. (Among many passages of scintillating dialogue is a rapid-fire exchange between the affluent Sean who comes on like a slacker collecting unemployment and a bright but skeptical girl ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""You mean youre unemployed."" ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""So whats your latest preneur?"") But the films substance lies mainly in its convoluted tale of vast ambition--an ambition oddly disconnected in Mr. Zuckerbergs case from a desire to make money--spectacular success and bitter betrayal. Not since ""Apollo 13"" has a mainstream motion picture conveyed so much factual as well as dramatic information with such clarity and agility. First Mark moves beyond--or pilfers the intellectual property of--three upperclassmen whod approached him for help on a website they called Harvard Connection. Later the newly-minted young magnate has a painful falling out with Facebooks original business manager Eduardo Saverin hes played with great subtlety and rueful charm by Andrew Garfield wholl be seen as Peter Parker in the next ""Spider-Man."" While the movies prevailing mood is excitation--hardly a moment goes by when someone isnt having a brilliant idea--its dominant mode is litigation thanks to one suit on behalf of those Harvard upperclassmen and another brought by Eduardo. The lawsuits require obligatory scenes of adversaries meeting and arguing in offices but youd never know they were obligatory because they interweave past and present to electrifying effect. Another marvelous office scene involves Lawrence Summers (played by an actor not by himself) who was Harvards president at the time. The director Mr. Fincher makes no distinction between action or exposition between a conference-room confrontation or an English regatta. He stages every moment with fearless energy and a firm touch and turns the rapier wit of Mr. Sorkins script into verbal swordplay while Mr. Eisenberg makes Mark a digital Zorro slashing his way through Silicon Valley. Thats a phenomenal performance by any measure. The intensity of Marks aggressivity is fascinating though you keep waiting for him to reveal some fugitive trace of emotion. And the wait is rewarded when his psyche finally undergoes a subtle change. Its like the just-in-time delivery of a crucial part. ""The Social Network"" is powered by impeccable craftsmanship. Rooney Mara the young actress wholl be playing Lisbeth Salander in Mr. Finchers English-language version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is impressive as Erica the girl in the preface who likens Mark to an exercise machine. Donald Graham Burt did the production design. The elegant cinematography is the work of Jeff Cronenweth (who comes by it naturally; his late father Jordan was one of the best shooters of his time). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the hard-driving music which reflects the nature of Marks mind while the sound design by Ren Klyce is reminiscent of Johnny Greenwoods wonderfully woozy score for ""There Will Be Blood."" Its the sound of ambition untethered. Let Me In ENLARGE Chloe Grace Moretz left as a young vampire and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the neighbor who befriends her in Let Me In. Overture Films Two years ago a Swedish vampire movie called ""Let the Right One In"" was greeted on these shores by glowing reviews. As one of its many admirers I called it remarkably fine and genuinely frightening and reserved special praise for the elegance of Tomas Alfredsons direction and the formal beauty of Hoyte Van Hoytemas cinematography. The film was also greeted by box office revenues reflective of the unfortunate fact that mainstream audience wont turn out for foreign films with subtitles that require reading. Fortunately the English-language version the title of which has reasonably been shortened was written and directed by Matt Reeves whose previous feature was the accomplished sci-fi thriller ""Cloverfield."" His new one works a number of changes on ""Let the Right One In"" though much of it follows the original shot for shot. But this is more than a respectful remake; ""Let Me In"" is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right. Watch a clip from the film ""Let Me In"" starring Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Moretz and Richard Jenkins. The action has been transferred from suburban in Sweden to small-town Los Alamos in 1983; if the New Mexico locale whispers aliens thats no coincidence. As before the standard genders of the vampire genre are reversed. The story centers on a boy whos the victim of schoolyard bullies (his name is Owen and hes played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his androgynous new neighbor whos now called Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz the distinctive heroine of ""Kick-Ass"" which is a credit that warrants both flaunting and living down). Abby needs blood to live but Owen needs a buddy to survive so its a match made in a hell that resembles heaven. (Greig Fraser did the austere cinematography and Michael Giacchino contributed the fine score.) Richard Jenkins plays Abbys unnamed facilitator; his grisly rituals reminded me of Alfred Hitchcocks effort in ""The Torn Curtain"" to show how difficult it can be to kill someone with bare hands. The two young leads are limited vocally--their dialogue scenes sometimes devolve into drone duets--but they make an improbably and magnetically loving couple even if one of the lovers doesnt qualify as human. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Panic Room (2002) Jodie Foster is a newly divorced mother and Kristen Stewart is her young daughter in this ingenious thriller directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by David Koepp. Mother and daughter are first seen in a house-hunting expedition on Manhattans Upper West Side where a real-estate agent showing them through a vast empty brownstone says ""Its a very emotional property."" This proves to be an understatement. One of the brownstones selling points is a panic room a high-tech refuge from disaster or home invasion and whats the point of a panic-room movie if the home isnt promptly invaded? Zombieland (2009) I mentioned ""Zombieland"" a couple of weeks ago in my review of ""Easy A"" since the star of that high school comedy Emma Stone plays the larcenous Wichita in this improbably delicious horror comedy. But the movie really belongs to Jesse Eisenbergs wistful but tenacious neurotic who calls himself Columbus and Woody Harrelsons tight-jawed gun-slinging Tallahassee. (Wichitas kid sister Little Rock is played somewhat tentatively by Abigail Breslin.) Dont expect anything more from the film than entertainment but dont expect less. The director Ruben Fleischer and the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick sustain a high degree of silliness. The Road (2009) All too few people populate this film which was directed by John Hillcoat and adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel. Its concerned mainly with a father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) slogging across a slag-heap American landscape after the planet has suffered an unexplained apocalypse that killed the flora the fauna and most of the spectrum (though the sickly light from a blighted sun does manage to produce one wan rainbow). In a brief but memorable appearance Robert Duvall finds fleeting poetry in an old mans attempt to talk about his own son. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Andrew Garfield Joseph Mazzello Jesse Eisenberg and Patrick Maple. (Columbia Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 30 2010 134 PM Title The Social Network Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg makes enemies as he creates Facebook. With Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake. Director David Fincher (205). PG-13 Language. At area theaters.The opening of the hyper-smart superbly entertaining ""The Social Network"" sets the tone for the film Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his almost-ex girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) are talking in a Harvard bar - well shes talking; hes in a conversational battle - and not clicking. In this moment and for the rest of the (mostly) true story Zuckerberg appears to be a human search engine fueled by insecurity. His every word is a window into his head and eventually his relationship with connection and alienation will suck in the entire world.Written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher the entire movie unfolds this way. One thought links to the next one which leads to another and then another and suddenly ""The Social Network"" - a work deeper than its nickname ""The Facebook Movie"" hints at - coils around your brain. Weeks after seeing it moments from it will haunt you.The films structure like Facebook itself is deceptively simple a pretrial deposition involving Zuckerberg and some former friends who beginning in 2003 were in on the creation of various inauspicious websites. Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) provides Zuckerberg with algorithms and appreciation as the young nerd creates a prototype site to get back at Erica.Meanwhile the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer in two roles) provide access to Harvards more elite corners. They all back the Dobbs Ferry dork as he borrows imagines and steals ideas for ""thefacebook"" which begins at Harvard and spreads like a virus before anyone knows exactly what it is.Jessie Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake rule Social Network. (Columbia)Sean Parker knows though. Parker (Justin Timberlake) saw one monster Napster crash and burn and now the college dropout/huckster sees Facebook (its his notion to drop the ""the"") as the way of the future. As Parker says in one particularly chilling line ""We lived on farms we lived in cities and now well live on the Internet.""The tussle these boy geniuses have for fame and profit is the way Sorkin gets past an initially static story line. The creator of ""The West Wing"" knows about smart people talking fast and here that formula is amped up to its eyeballs. The actors - especially Eisenberg and Timberlake - are on fire and the storys guts are both immediate and timeless.While other filmmakers would let the wonky tone overtake them Fincher is a filmmaker whose best work (""Seven"" ""Fight Club"" ""Zodiac"") finds strength in acquainting us with loners who dream of changing their status and here he has the perfect one for our era. Whether Zuckerberg did or didnt wish to be the face of Facebook in Fincher and Sorkins hands hes the modern worlds conflicted soul.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Creation myths always need a devil"" says a character in ""The Social Network"" David Finchers mesmerizing Genesis story about Facebook. The speaker is a lawyer advising the sites creator to settle a high-stakes lawsuit out of court. A jury would hate Mark Zuckerberg. Hes condescending coldly brilliant and peevish. Opposing counsel could demonize him before the first recess. We meet him as a Harvard sophomore boring his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) with haughty talk about his schools elite social clubs which she a lowly Boston University student could never enter. (Neither can Zuckerberg who is dimly aware he lacks the essential likability to make the cut.) He also jabbers about the number of geniuses in China oil futures and meteorology juggling multiple trains of thought while making scant effort to hold a conversation. ""Going out with you is like dating a Stairmaster"" the restless girl sighs. Zuckerberg played with twitchy intensity by Jesse Eisenberg has not a moments self-doubt about his prodigious intellect. As a human being however he is nothing but doubt fear and insecurity. He is ruled by ambition impatient to be famous rich admired. ""I dont need friends"" the thin-skinned Zuckerberg snaps when Erica says thats all she can be for him. He proves it by blogging about her maliciously later that evening. Zuckerberg does have friend-like connections to a few fellow students primarily business partner Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) whose checkbook kept Facebook online in the early days when all that could be said about it was ""It is cool."" Theres a core decency about Saverin who is the films heart soul and conscience. As their project grows beyond the campus it draws the attention of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the bad-boy co-founder of Napster. At a trendy sushi restaurant Parker dazzles the maladroit Zuckerberg with his effortless cool. Saverin recoils offended by Parkers seductive manner. Like Mephistopheles Parker tempts Zuckerberg with wealth sex and fame; its no coincidence that he orders a round of Apple-tinis. Parker inserts himself between the partners maneuvering himself into an ownership stake in their project. Timberlakes smug charisma and Garfields talent for looking hapless and outcast are brilliantly used here. The script echoes ""Citizen Kanes"" labyrinthine structure and fractured chronology. Fincher cross-cuts between Zuckerbergs rocketing rise and his imperious testimony in two lawsuits by parties who charge -- with some justification -- that he swindled them out of fortunes. Fincher gives the story the vitality and clear coherent tension of a thriller. Merrick Morton Columbia Pictures Jesse Eisenberg is Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and Joseph Mazzello is co-creator Dustin Moskovitz in ""The Social Network."" His use of special effects once again sets a new standard. Fincher cast actor Armie Hammer to play the well-born identical Winklevoss twins who claim that Zuckerberg stole the Facebook concept from them. The director digitally superimposed Hammers face on a body double for scores of scenes showing both brothers to flawless effect. Fincher shapes scenes and sequences masterfully gradually shifting our sympathies among a range of flawed humanly believable characters. You hate them then you feel their pain. At one point the pedigreed Winklevoss brothers take their complaint before Harvard President Larry Summers whose sarcastic response strikes the privileged pair like a slap in the face. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (creator of TVs ""The West Wing"") a connoisseur of dark comic injustice outdoes himself. For all his double-dealing and hubris we feel grudging sympathy for Zuckerberg. Hes not the storys devil but its Dr. Faustus selling his soul for worldly glory. He is only one player in an ecosystem of characters trading money sex and prestige for advantage. The tale mirrors ""Kanes"" story of an isolated unloved boy who creates a media empire to exalt his ego and punish his foes leaving a trail of embittered colleagues and betrayed friends in his wake. But it is much more than that scrutinizing the sexual morals business ethics and class ideology of our age across multiple levels of society. The film lives up to its all-encompassing title. As a character study and social critique ""The Social Network"" wont just reward repeat viewings it demands them.

She dumps him; he heads to his computer.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 01 2010How do you distinguish yourself in a roomful of people where everyone has 1600s on their SATs? One answer is offered by The Social Network the enthralling near-perfect comedy of manners from David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin Create the next big thing that everyone in that room - not to mention the known universe - finds indispensable.The Social Network is many things. It is the origin story of Facebook an incisive portrait of the dorm hermit who cant read social cues but built the social mousetrap that caught millions and an acid-etched picture of friends unfriended. Most of all it is the improbably entertaining story of how new media are altering the very nature of courtship and friendship.A tack-sharp adaptation of Ben Mezrichs nonfiction The Accidental Billionaires The Social Network begins in 2003 with college sophomores on a date at a Boston bar. It ends in 2008 with one electronically spying on the other.What Fincher sharp-eyed chronicler of contemporary masculinity (Zodiac Fight Club) and Sorkin keen-eared scribe of modern idealism (The West Wing) do in the intervening two hours is give a vivid history of the here and now. To comic and tragic effect they show how Facebook (like the telephone and e-mail before it) became a connector that can just as easily distance people as bring them together.In the filmmakers view Facebook like its creator Mark Zuckerberg (well-played by a near-robotic Jesse Eisenberg) is incapable of inflection. Mark comes across as enigmatic both to friends and to fellow students who charge that he stole the idea for Facebook.Mark is the archetypal Sorkin insider frustrated that others cant keep up with him. Mark is also the archetypal Fincher outsider envious that hes missing out.In a (literally) breathtaking opening that establishes the films pace and its themes Mark a Harvard sophomore is having a drink with his girl Erica (Rooney Mara) a Boston University undergraduate.Words spray from him like foam from a pressurized beer bottle. As he holds forth on his hopes for being ""punched"" for a final club Harvards elite super-fraternities that confer social cachet Erica shrinks back. After he verbally bullies her she dumps him. Back at the dorm he bad-mouths her on his blog and creates Facemash where guys rank the comparative hotness of girls discarding the loser as Mark himself has just been discarded.But before he can put Facemash online Mark needs his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in a performance as expressive and open as Eisenbergs is closed) to write the algorithm. Their little prank receives 22000 hits in four hours and crashes the Harvard computer network.While Mark doesnt get punched by a final club he does get tapped by three members of Porcellian club of clubs to write the code for a social network called ""Harvard Connection."" This brainchild of the patrician Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by genial golden boy Armie Hammer) and their friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) is as exclusive as Facebook would be inclusive.Working with digital cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth Fincher characterizes Harvard as a shadowy hive. The tense audio undercurrent designed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross simulates the sound of buzzing bees.What gives The Social Network its propulsive energy are its flashes forward and back from Facebooks creation to its consolidation. (It swings from Revenge of the Nerd to Revenge on the Nerd.) When Mark might have been sitting on top of the world he was swatting off lawsuits from Saverin and the Harvard Connection trio.Its astonishing that a movie mostly set in front of computer screens and in deposition rooms a movie where the end is already known has the hold of a suspense film. Fincher and Sorkin tell us what happened. But they involve us deeply in figuring out the why.The story of the two nerds who build Facebook so they can meet girls soon becomes a triangle where the earnest Eduardo and the slithery Internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake sensational as a Silicon Valley snake) are rivals for Mark.When Eduardo looks at Mark his wounded eyes say ""This isnt strictly business its personal."" But what can he expect when hes helped make the personal a business?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at crickeyphillynews. com or 215-854-5402.

Merrick Morton/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/Sony Pictures The Social Network Director David Fincher Genre Drama Running Time 120 minutes PG-13 for sexual content drug and alcohol use and language With Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake Andrew Garfield Rashida Jones (Recommended) Watch Clips Were Ranking Girls People Dont Walk Around With Signs I Dont Hate Anybody A week ago Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave the Newark N.J. school system 100 million on the same day the movie The Social Network opened at the New York Film Festival. The speculation was that he was trying to burnish his reputation before the movie tarnished it. The film opens across the country today so ... let the tarnishing begin. The story of how Facebook was invented almost accidentally in a Harvard dorm room should have been near-impossible to film -- computer geeks code-writing legal depositions. But boy does it click along from the moment Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg as a cold-eyed awkward boy genius) decides to get back at a girlfriend who dumps him during the opening credits. Zuckerbergs revenge? He hacks some school photo archives and enlists his best buddy in a dumb sexist online stunt They start using complicated mathematics to rank the girls at school. Their hot-or-not prank gets so many hits it crashes Harvards server and the dweebs are briefly campus celebs. Zuckerberg is still obnoxious though and devious too When hes approached to work on a socializing website for a couple of golden-boy jocks he stalls and tries to develop one of his own. But its all just names and pictures until a roommate comes to him one day with a question that gives Mark a moment of inspiration The website needs to do something. Mark is out the door so fast he doesnt even realize it has snowed until his socks and sandals are ankle deep in the stuff. Its a throwaway moment but the kind that says worlds about the characters mindset. When people talk about mesmerizing speakers they often say theyd be happy to listen to them reciting the phone book. Let me just say Id be happy to watch David Fincher directing the phone book. With scripter Aaron Sorkin providing the verbal fireworks Fincher tags and pokes his way through an almost Shakespearean thicket of betrayals and double-crosses. (You expect a Facebook movie to be about friending?) Think again Zuckerbergs co-founder who is given an almost visible conscience by Andrew Garfield spars with Napsters creator (played as a snake in the digital grass by Justin Timberlake). Both of them think the cold fish whose approval theyre fighting over actually gives a damn but his thoughts are ever elsewhere and sooner or later almost everyone who meets him cant stand him perhaps especially the Winklevoss twins -- the jocks who originally asked him to work on their campus-socializing site. Eisenbergs Mark gets help from Napsters founder Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake. Merrick Morton/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/Sony Pictures Though the film conforms to the general contours of the public record theres a good deal of fictionalizing going on in The Social Network. For example that girlfriend who dumps Zuckerberg in the opening to start things rolling? Made up. The real Zuckerberg and his fellow gazillionaires wouldnt talk to director David Fincher and his team -- probably a good thing for the filmmakers as it frees them to invent character traits and motivations. Its less good for the gazillionaires even if they can afford to buy respectability back but hey thats entertainment. And The Social Network is terrific entertainment -- an unlikely thriller that makes business ethics class distinctions and intellectual-property arguments sexy that zips through two hours quicker than you can say ""relationship status"" and thatll likely fascinate pretty much anyone not named Zuckerberg. Oh and its one that sends you out of the theater buzzing breathless and eager to tell all of your friends and friends of friends that youve just seen what might end up being the best picture of the year.

Updated July 30 2016  1253 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Story of Facebook makes for a top film BY CALVIN WILSON  calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8346 Sep 30 2010 (...) Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is computer-savvy but hard to read. His stated goal is to bring people together and he has an idea that will prove to be more successful than he could ever imagine Facebook.But hes so lacking in social skills that he alienates his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) and just about everyone else in his circle -- including Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).As an investor in Facebook Saverin expects to be kept in the loop. But hes gradually pushed to the side when Napster creator Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) takes an interest in their budding enterprise. Zuckerberg who wears flip-flops even when trudging through snow is as flattered by Parkers attention as he is dismissive of the wealthy Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) twin brothers who accuse him of stealing their idea for an online social network.It all comes down to multibillionaire Zuckerberg confronting lawsuits from Saverin and the Winklevosses. But the Facebook honchos tongue turns out to be as sharp as his mind. Working from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") director David Fincher (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") delivers a film thats at once timely and timeless. You dont have to be an Internet fanatic to relate to this tale of relentless pursuit of the American dream. Fincher has made quite a few terrific films from ""Se7en"" to the underrated ""Zodiac."" But this time hes outdone himself. ""The Social Network"" is riveting from start to finish and a master class in directing. And in this era of unchallenging multiplex fodder Sorkins script sparkles with intelligence and wit.Eisenberg and Garfield are almost certain to get Oscar nominations and Timberlake is impressive as the slick ethically dubious Parker.""The Social Network"" is one of the best films of the year.

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones The Social Network the social network Directed by david fincher ""There will be time there will be time"" T.S. Eliot once cryptically wrote ""to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet."" For Mark Zuckerberg the camera-shy entrepreneur who created Facebook and went on to become the worlds youngest billionaire time is running out. This weekend brings the nationwide opening of David Finchers buzzy drama The Social Network which recounts how Zuckerberg launched the site with his friend and fellow Harvard undergrad Eduardo Saverin then shafted Saverin in a 2005 stock reorganization. Adapted by Aaron Sorkin (creator of The West Wing) from Ben Mezrichs zingy best seller The Accidental Billionaires the movie portrays Zuckerberg as a first-class heel a supremely arrogant tech nerd driven by his hunger for social status and it seems destined to define him publicly. Watching The Social Network the real Zuckerberg may feel as if someone has hacked into his Facebook account and changed his profile picture. Zuckerberg has been showing his face more often in the last few months mounting whats been widely perceived as a preemptive strike. In July he granted a rare TV interview to Diane Sawyer for ABCs World News and in September he was the subject of a relatively flattering profile in the New Yorker. Zuckerberg also appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show last week to be applauded for his donation of 100 million to the public school system in Newark New Jersey (a city to which he has no personal connection). The appearance was a publicists wet dream Winfrey ran a clip that showed Zuckerberg and his girlfriend inside their modest four-bedroom rental home in Palo Alto California and mitigated the suspicious timing of his gift by explaining that hed planned to make it anonymous before she and Newark mayor Cory Booker talked him into coming on the show. Winfrey then introduced the topic of the ""unauthorized"" movie which she declined to name and invited Zuckerberg to issue whatever comment he chose. He cheerily dismissed it and Winfrey quickly moved on. Zuckerbergs standard response to The Social Network has been to call it fiction (a verdict apparently based on a script leaked online last year) and to say he has no intention of seeing it. The fiction label has been adopted by others as well (""Most People Dont Know The Social Network Is Fiction"" read a recent headline at the independent blog Allfacebook.com) yet the more accurate term would be fictionalized. Both Mezrich and Sorkin employ the now-common techniques of re-created dialogue composite scenes and names changed to protect the privacy of bystanders. But the events they chronicle are mostly drawn from interviews and from depositions in two high-profile suits against Zuckerberg--one filed by Saverin and the other by a trio of Harvard students who alleged that Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them. The various court proceedings serve as a narrative frame for the movie allowing us to understand which recollections are a matter of dispute. Given all the privacy issues that have sprung up around Facebook theres something perversely satisfying about seeing its creators own privacy invaded. Yet on Facebook the biggest threat to your privacy is yourself. You can restrict access to most of your information allowing only friends to see it. But as the friend requests roll in friendship is inevitably defined downward from intimates to casual acquaintances to ultimately people who just want something from you (in my case coverage for their indie movie). Eventually you realize that the things youve been posting arent the least bit private because your circle of friends has gradually widened outward to include all the avenues of your life experience school work family romance. When I post something on Facebook now I try to be as careful as if I were publishing it in the Reader because I might as well be. Played with smug impassivity by Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) the Mark Zuckerberg of The Social Network shows absolutely no regard for other peoples privacy--yet ironically the sequence that portrays him thus was mainly fabricated by Sorkin. The movie opens at a bar near the Harvard campus where Mark and his girlfriend Erica (an invented character played by Rooney Mara) are locked in one of those rapid-fire hyper-witty arguments that have become Sorkins (rather irritating) trademark. After Erica gives Mark his walking papers he returns to his dorm room drunk and launches into a tirade about her on his LiveJournal blog ""Erica Albright is a bitch. . . . For the record she may look like a 34D but shes getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victorias Secret. Shes a 34B as in barely anything there. False advertising."" Later in the film when Mark runs into Erica at a bar he seems oblivious to the fact that hes violated her trust by posting her most personal information on the World Wide Web. The LiveJournal scene may be largely fiction but its followed by one thats documented fact that same night inspired by his bantering dormitory pals Mark hacks into various Harvard sites downloads hundreds of photos of undergraduate women and launches a new site called Facemash that allows users to rank the women physically. The site gets 22000 hits before crashing the universitys entire system which gets Mark called before a disciplinary hearing. The prank also gives him such a bad name with women around campus that he jumps at the chance to rehabilitate his image by creating a more popular social networking site with two well-connected upperclassmen. Mark later blows them off to collaborate with his friend Eduardo on a similar site called the Facebook. The episode illustrates a social truth thats just as pertinent now with Zuckerbergs 100 million donation to the Newark schools once something negative about you becomes public you can never get it back; your only hope is to counteract it with something positive. By the end of The Social Network Mark has learned the value of at least one persons privacy--his own. The final scene takes place in a law firm conference room after one of the depositions has wrapped up. Alone with one of his attorneys (another invented character played by Rashida Jones) Mark learns to his amazement that his legal team will be preparing a settlement offer for the three Harvard students he stiffed despite their weak case. ""Youre gonna need these guys to sign a nondisclosure agreement and youre gonna need to be indemnified"" the attorney tells him. ""They say one unflattering word about you in public and you own their house wife and kids."" That settlement details of which were leaked in February 2009 amounted to 65 million in cash and stock. That may be a drop in the bucket for Zuckerberg but its a stunning amount to pay for a little privacy--especially when you consider its going rate on Facebook.

"Howell Social Network possibly the best movie of year | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHowell Social Network possibly the best movie of yearThe Social Network possibly the years best movie shows what can happen when you link the world but unhook your loved ones.Justin Timberlake left and Jesse Eisenberg star in The Social Network.  (AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Sept. 29 2010The Social Network(out of 4)Starring Jesse Eisenberg Justin Timberlake Andrew Garfield and Rooney Mara. Directed by David Fincher. At major theatres. 120 minutes. 14AWith so many interactions now reduced to status updates on Facebook or 140-character Twitter bursts it may seem as though we have this messy human-to-human thing all figured out.Except we dont. People in the 21st century are every bit as crude brutal and self-serving as when cavemen were knocking each other over the head with clubs. The digital realm simply provides a new mask for base behavior even if that mask looks to be the smiley face of a friend.Article Continued BelowThis is the eternal verity that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin pursue so well and with such delicious irony in The Social Network a drama about the creation of Facebook. It may be the years best movie.It stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg the geeky Harvard student who in 2004 started Facebook in his dorm room launching a social media revolution and making himself Americas youngest billionaire. Zuckerbergs zeal also sparked two lawsuits from former friends and business associates who claimed the baby-faced boffin used conned and defrauded them.You might well wonder why Hollywood big leaguers like Fincher (Zodiac Fight Club) and Sorkin (TVs The West Wing) would be so fascinated in a nebbishy figure like Zuckerberg the Peter Pan of the Internet.Why not instead do a film about real characters like Steve Jobs Bill Gates or the two guys who invented Google? Fincher and Sorkin realized and the rest of us do upon seeing The Social Network that Zuckerbergs transformation from carefree hacker into one of the worlds most avaricious businessmen was a story of Biblical dimensions.Heres a man who as the story goes gained 500 million Facebook ""friends"" and yet who sold out the one true pal who believed in him and supported him. Zuckerberg may be the epitome of modern falseness an artificial friend for a virtual world.Hes essayed to perfection by Eisenberg an actor of grace and skill who previously seemed fated to playing only well-meaning nerds in films like Adventureland and Zombieland. His Zuckerberg is a figure of enigmatic malevolence deeper than he seems but also much darker as drained of blood as a vampires victim. Eisenberg also brings a nice touch of black humor to the proceedings expertly delivering the many zingers from Sorkins wicked pen and personifying the subterranean rumble that is Trent Reznors and Atticus Ross soundtrack.The film also boasts a peak performance by Justin Timberlake whose real-life alter ego as a pop star more than equips him for the evil clown role of Sean Parker the co-inventor of Napster. He arrives midway through the film seeming as little more than a party animal and fellow golden geek but hes the catalyst for the films most shocking act of betrayal.The reputed treachery victim was Brazilian-born Eduardo Saverin Zuckerbergs closest friend at Harvard and the co-founder of Facebook. A successful businessman even as a student he staked Zuckerberg for an 18000 line of credit and was Facebooks original business manager before events took a twisted turn.Played with understated brilliance by Andrew Garfield who is about to become the new webslinger in a rebooted Spider-Man franchise Saverin is everything that Zuckerberg isnt a gentleman a popular figure on campus and a ladies man. These qualities also describe twin rowing champs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by the nimble Armie Hammer) who also allege Zuckerbergian subterfuge. They claim to have thought of Facebook first along with their friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and they conscripted Zuckerberg to help them create it. Instead Zuckerberg reportedly went off on his own misleading his friends and associates about his true intentions until it was too late and lawyers entered the picture. The Social Network adroitly slides between emotional confrontations and bone-dry courtroom procedures at all times retaining its focus on the fascinating cipher that is Zuckerberg.Sorkins script is based on The Accidental Billionaires a book by Ben Mezrich that ploughs much of the same turf; Zuckerberg naturally disputes both accounts. The movie begins with a fictional although emotionally truthful barroom encounter between Zuckerberg and his frustrated girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) who first utters the ""a--hole"" condemnation that will be amplified and pondered throughout the film. Shes the strongest female in a picture dominated by males and the most visible sign of humanity in the gladiators pit of the Facebook wars.Thirty-four years ago this fall the buzz was about another media movie one with just Network for a title. It featured a TV anchorman named Howard Beale played by Peter Finch who was ""mad as hell"" about the falseness of society and the loss of human values represented by a plugged-in populace.Little did Beale realize that no matter how much he wailed the future world illustrated by The Social Network would continue to make fake attachments while inventing diabolical new connections.Read more about Justin Timberlake Mark Zuckerberg FacebookThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Social Network    (out of four)Stars Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Justin Timberlake Director David FincherDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for sexual content drug and alcohol use and languageRunning time 2 hoursOpens in select theaters Thursday night and Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In A Few Good Men screenwriter Aaron Sorkin examined the limits of honor. In The Social Network he focuses on a few nerd men and their dishonorable behavior single-minded ambition and greed. Brilliantly directed by David Fincher this provocative film probes the impetus for invention the changing face of social interaction and the limits of friendship -- the old-fashioned kind and the version linking 500 million Facebook users. The film owes much of its success to the inspired pairing of Fincher and Sorkin. Fincher tantalizes audiences into dark places as in Zodiac (2007) and Fight Club (1999). Sorkins rapid-fire banter artfully blends comedy and tragedy as on the 1999-2006 TV series The West Wing. TRAILER Get a peek at The Social Network INTERVIEW Timberlakes time is now on big screen They tell the fascinating story of Mark Zuckerberg and his genius idea conceived in 2003 while he was a Harvard sophomore. Whether its an accurate view of the 26-year-old Facebook CEO is debatable. (Zuckerberg did not cooperate with the filmmakers.) But perhaps ambiguity is the point. As portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg Zuckerberg is a paradoxical figure. Hes the quintessence of arrogant ruthlessness yet hes awkwardly innocent. He weaves a worldwide web of friendships but heartlessly severs his own personal bonds when they prove inconvenient. Eisenbergs career has been building to this bravura performance from his musician wannabe in The Squid and the Whale to an aimless college grad in Adventureland. With a disquieting stare and a string of acerbic comments tumbling from his mouth he exudes neurotic intelligence. Zuckerberg is revealed in flashbacks and flash-forwards within a framework of legal proceedings. The sparring centers on the ownership of an idea whose time had clearly come. Hes sued by former best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and twin 6-foot-5 Olympic hopefuls Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer). Garfield is terrific conveying Saverins palpable sense of betrayal and Justin Timberlake skillfully embodies slick Napster co-founder Sean Parker who takes Zuckerberg under his highflying wing. The story was based on Ben Mezrichs best-selling The Accidental Billionaires. Rooney Mara plays the smart girl who dumps Zuckerberg and catapults him back to his laptop. Had he succeeded in wooing her the world might have had to remain content with MySpace. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"The Social Network (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Social Network (PG-13) The geeks shall inherit the Earth. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez - The Miami Herald9/29/2010 Editor rating 4 David Finchers extraordinary The Social Network opens with a simple scene that serves as a template for everything that is to follow. In a crowded restaurant two college kids are out on a date. Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) goes to Harvard while his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) attends Boston University. Over drinks Mark prattles on about having gotten a perfect score on his SAT and the difficulties of getting into final clubs (Harvards oldest and most elite fraternities). Erica moans about having a lot of homework to plow through but Mark dismisses her complaint (""You dont have to study because you go to B.U.). ""Dating you is like dating a StairMaster Erica observes about Marks rat-tat-tat thought process and is left agog at his capacity for casual thoughtless cruelty. The scene ends with an angry Erica breaking up with Mark eviscerating him with an observation so cutting it sets in motion events that will lead to the creation of Facebook - and make Mark the youngest billionaire in the world. The Social Network was written by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing Sports Night) who packs two movies worth of dialogue into two hours at a rollicking dare-you-to-keep-up speed. Directed in plain unobtrusive style by Fincher the film consists mostly of people talking as it cuts back and forth between Harvard in 2003-04 and the legal depositions that take place several years later. But despite the ceaseless yammering The Social Network delivers the heady rib-tickling rush of an action picture and it gradually builds to an emotional wallop that blindsides you. When its over you immediately want to watch it again to figure out how the filmmakers pulled off the trick. Initially the movie seems to be a detailed recreation of the motivation that led Zuckerberg - an intensely awkward fiercely intelligent kid with perhaps a touch of Aspergers and a restless ambition - to create a website for Harvard students to chat and interact. According to the movie Zuckerberg stole the idea for the site from the twin jocks Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer in a wonderfully witty entertaining manner) who rowed crew for Harvard and their frat brother Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The three first approached Zuckerberg for his computer skills and later successfully sued him for 65 million. To fund his website which was initially called thefacebook.com Zuckerberg turned to his only true friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who became his business partner and tried to monetize the enterprise as the websites popularity grew. But Saverin too ended up suing Zuckerberg settling for an undisclosed amount rumored to be in the hundreds of millions. The story behind the creation of Facebook is interesting enough but what makes The Social Network soar - what makes it easily the best movie of the year thus far - is its insights into human behavior. Harvard is depicted as a privileged microcosm with a set of rigid social and class delineations mirroring those of the outside world. When lonely bitter Zuckerberg holes up in his dorm room the film cuts to decadent parties across campus (are they real or are we seeing what he imagines popular kids are like?). His alienation and longing to belong curdle into disdain. Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a genius incapable of suffering fools. He only maintains eye contact with people he looks up to or respects Eduardo visiting lecturer Bill Gates (playing himself) or Napster founder Sean Parker (an exceptionally suave Justin Timberlake) who eventually secures the funding necessary for Facebook to expand globally. Zuckerberg is a prickly secretive outcast - a nerd smarter than everyone else in the room - and through his story The Social Network captures the way society casts people in roles that are often difficult if not impossible to escape without radical action. There is no small irony in the fact that Zuckerberg decided to build a network for interacting with the world the way in which he was most comfortable - via a computer keyboard - and 500 million people followed him. The Social Network doesnt take sides on the ethics or morality of what Zuckerberg did although Saverin played with great empathy and likability by Garfield could be considered the films true hero - a man who stood by his friend when no one else did and trusted him only to be stabbed in the back when his services were no longer needed. Because of the subject matter The Social Network has the feel of a zeitgeist movie ""You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because thats what the angry do Zuckerbergs ex-girlfriend snarls at him essentially defining - and decimating - much of the contemporary blogosphere. In cyberspace the lonely and unloved have an outlet for their rage and pain. Zuckerberg just happened to figure out a way to get rich voicing his. The Social Network is a snapshot of our brave new world and its permutations of eternal human emotions and in Zuckerberg it finds a perfect poster child for its message. ""Im not a bad guy he says at one point in his own defense. By the end of this rich dense dazzling movie you agree with him. More InformationThe Social NetworkA Columbia Pictures release.

"Movie review The Social Network - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FacebookMovie review The Social NetworkThe film about Facebook and its founder is well written by Aaron Sorkin well directed by David Fincher and well acted by Jesse Eisenberg.October 01 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Could it be that the person who founded Facebook the man who connected so many individuals that the total defies belief (500 million and counting) is himself incapable of close personal friendship? Is it possible that the worlds youngest self-made billionaire a 26-year-old whose creation unites people in 207 countries using 70 languages is the loneliest guy on the planet? If that sounds like a hell of a premise you dont know the half of it. Smartly written by Aaron Sorkin directed to within an inch of its life by David Fincher and anchored by a perfectly pitched performance by Jesse Eisenberg ""The Social Network"" is a barn-burner of a tale that unfolds at a splendid clip. Yet while nothing is more au courant than the Facebook phenomenon ""Social Network"" succeeds because its story is the stuff of archetypal movie drama. It marries the tradition of present-at-the-creation epics like ""Dr. Ehrlichs Magic Bullet"" ""Madame Curie"" and ""Edison the Man"" with the familiar story of the corrupting power of ambition and success that allows audiences to feel and not for the first time that their ordinary lives have more meaning than those of the rich and famous. Where ""Social Network"" departs from those earlier biopics is that as played by Eisenberg protagonist Mark Zuckerberg is introduced as extremely unlikable rather than heroic a self-absorbed and arrogant 19-year-old Harvard sophomore who is as socially maladroit as he is fearsomely smart. An actor who has nailed every discontented role hes had including ""Roger Dodger"" ""The Squid and the Whale"" and ""Adventureland"" Eisenberg excels as someone whose success is fueled in classic movie fashion by resentments of all shapes and sizes. His Zuckerberg is so consumed by the drive to get even and gain status that no one is a match for the combination of ruthless focus and disinterested frigidity he brings to the table. The opportunity to simultaneously portray and dissect this kind of compelling yet distant individual is an ideal fit for Fincher. Presented with an involving central character cold enough to suit his chilly but considerable filmmaking talents the director does his best work convincingly presenting a story about conflicts over intellectual property as if it were a fast-paced James Bond thriller. ""Social Network"" is fluidly shot by Jeff Cronenweth with convincing production design by Donald Graham Burt both Fincher regulars and the director also has the benefit of working with Sorkins strong and persuasive script. As fans of TVs ""The West Wing"" well remember Sorkin writes great crackling dialogue that dramatically represents the dynamics of power relations and he puts that gift to great use here. Both his writing and the unnerving music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross bring so much propulsive energy to the project that resistance is all but futile. Although the film is based on Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires"" Sorkin did his own research into the story and his treatment doesnt have an ounce of fat on it. Though there has been talk of ""Social Network"" having Rashomon elements that is something of a red herring. The films characters naturally have differing viewpoints and details are argued over but the basic thrust of this tale never wavers no matter whose eyes events are being told through. ""The Social Network"" begins by positing that it was a very specific social resentment that got Zuckerberg started on his road to billions. The film opens at an undergraduate bar near the Harvard campus in the fall of 2003 with Zuckerberg getting dumped by his girlfriend Erica ( Rooney Mara soon to be Lisbeth Salander in the Fincher-directed versions of the Stieg Larsson trilogy). Going out with him she says tartly is ""like dating a Stairmaster."" Furious at this rejection Zuckerberg stomps back to his dorm and with the help of roommate and best friend Eduardo Saverin (the gifted shape-shifter Andrew Garfield) takes revenge by doing some adroit hacking and coming up with Facemash a site that enables students to vote on which Harvard women are the hottest. It gets 22000 hits in two hours and crashes the universitys system. That stunt attracts the attention of two of the schools elite rowers and identical twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played with the help of computer wizardry by two unrelated actors Armie Hammer and Josh Pence). They and friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) hire him to work on a university dating service they have in mind called Harvard Connection. Almost simultaneously Zuckerberg funded by best friend Saverin starts ""thefacebook"" which eventually morphs into you know what.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFacebook unveils Verified Pages for celebrities public...May 29 2013Expecting a baby?

In films like The Squid and the Whale (2005) and Adventureland (2009) Jesse Eisenberg his head lowered and jutting like a faithful dogs has played anxiously fast-talking insecure nice guys and he has often been marvelous. Yet hes staked out the kind of youth-neurotic terrain that by definition can never be electrifying. In The Social Network the thrillingly intense enjoyable and resonant new drama about the founding of Facebook Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg the brilliant ruthless Harvard student who rejiggered the spirit of the Internet age. From the opening moments the actor grips you with the armored force of his verbal attack. Were in a dark bar in Cambridge Mass. where Zuckerberg having a beer with his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) jabbers on about his thwarted desire to join one of Harvards elite final clubs. Eisenberg holds his head still and every line tumbles out as if hed shot it from his brain like a bullet. Hes not just talking hes working off his anger on whoever will listen -- in this case the girlfriend whos about to dump him and call him an ""a-hole."" In response Zuckerberg stalks across campus and posts a nasty blog item about her proving her characterization a bulls-eye. Then he goes further cobbling together a website called Facemash that invites students to survey paired photographs of coeds and say which one they think is hotter. Its an egregious idea -- and a huge hit. With his close-cropped curls and pursed lips that make him look like a Jewish-preppy John Lydon Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as an egomaniacal whiz-kid creep whos the smartest dude in any situation because hes outside it and inside it at the same time. The actor takes on a whole new aspect -- hes a geek programmed for revenge. And hes mesmerizing. Its hard to recall the last serious movie built around a character who was this much of an intellectual scoundrel. Yet the creators of The Social Network -- screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) whose dialogue here is so sharp it could slice ribbons and director David Fincher (Zodiac) -- have something tricky and emotionally complex up their sleeves. The story of how Zuckerberg put Facebook together one Silicon Valley bong bash and venture-capitalist powwow at a time is intercut with a pair of deposition hearings in which he faces down the two parties he ostensibly screwed over. The Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer with body-doubling by Josh Pence) are super-WASP Harvard crew champions who accuse Zuckerberg of ripping off their idea for a website that will allow Harvard students to interface with one another. Then theres Zuckerbergs partner CFO and only friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) whom he ultimately leaves out in the cold. The sizzling ethical-dramatic question that drives The Social Network is Why did Zuckerberg betray these people? Or in fact did he really? Hooked by the desire to belong but also by his dream of what a game changer Facebook could be Zuckerberg does whatever it takes to push his vision forward. Hes a cad but in his devious techno-entrepreneurial way hes also an idealist driven by a force greater than greed. Hes an Aspergers version of Citizen Kane aware of everything around him yet disengaged from it too. He undercuts the snobbery of the Winklevosses idea making it more supple and democratic even as he snatches it from under their blue-blood noses. The Social Network has everything you want in a thriller for the brain huge doses of ego and duplicity corporate backstabbing and some very layered performances. Justin Timberlake plays Sean Parker the Napster cofounder who helped launch Facebook as an ultra-shrewd party boy who encourages Zuckerberg to see that what looks illegal in the Internet era may in fact be the rules of the future. As the ingenuous Eduardo whose only crime is thinking small (which to Zuckerberg is the biggest crime of all) Andrew Garfield has a great moment where he confronts his ex-comrade. Its the tongue-lashing weve been waiting for yet the power of The Social Network is that Zuckerberg is a weasel with a mission that can never be dismissed. The movie suggests that he may have built his ambivalence about human connection into Facebooks very DNA. Thats what makes him a jerk-hero for our time.

The Social Network Great Director David Fincher. Cast Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield Armie Hammer. Rating PG-13 for sexual content drug and alcohol use and language. No single truth to Social Network story Jesse Eisenberg lands role of a lifetime Musicians in the movies Historical figures in film But with ""The Social Network"" director David Fincher has come up with a movie that in telling the turbulent story of whiz-kid Mark Zuckerbergs creation of Facebook isnt just compelling. Its great. With great assistance from Aaron Sorkins trademark lightning-fast dialogue Fincher doesnt really delve into who Zuckerberg is - he springs him upon us from the first scene as a fully formed misanthrope - as much as he explores the rapid-fire contemporary notion of social interaction inspiration and in a nice throwback to time immemorial backstabbing and jealousy. We meet Zuckerberg played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg during a withering discussion at a bar with his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) that ends with her dumping him. Enraged drunken he spends the next four hours in his Harvard dorm room creating a website that allows viewers to choose between two pictures of female students to vote on which one is hotter. To do this he has to hack into various supposedly secure accounts; this takes about as long as it takes most of us to write an e-mail. Meanwhile he disparages his now-former girlfriend in a blog. The hot-or-not site is so popular it crashes the universitys servers in a matter of hours. All in all a pretty eventful night. From there Zuckerberg captures the interest of both the university which isnt pleased with his work as well as two Harvard-to-the-core twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) who along with their friend Divya (Max Minghella) want to start a social-network site but need someone who can write the code to create it. What happens next is the subject of debate and not coincidentally legal action Zuckerberg goes off with his best (only) friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who provides the social contacts and the money to get the project off the ground. Called ""the Facebook"" its an immediate hit. As you probably know already. Facebook now has more than 500 million users; with numbers like that chances are you are one of them. But who came up with the idea? The Winklevoss twins? Zuckerberg? Fincher uses depositions from the various lawsuits as a framing device taking us back and forth between what might have happened when and the films present which finds Zuckerberg a billionaire and just as socially crippled as ever. From the point of view of Eduardo things went south when Zuckerberg met and fell under the spell of Sean Parker the co-creator of Napster played with winning smarm by Justin Timberlake. Deals are made backs are stabbed more lawsuits are filed. And Zuckerberg in this telling doesnt really care. He is more concerned with . . . what exactly? Thats a mystery neither Fincher nor Sorkin is inclined to solve maybe because there is no answer. He has no use for the personable minutiae required for successful face-to-face social interaction yet will pore over coding for hours to improve a place for virtual friendships. Oh irony. But this is an ironic age and Finchers film is spot-on in capturing it. Think of what hes working with here a film that goes into detail about computer code and algorithms that has virtually no action is instead heavy on people being deposed in a lawsuit in a generic conference room and contains virtually no one with whom we can relate or would back in a fight. Yet its one of the best movies of the year one of the best entries ever in the Way We Live Now oeuvre. Whether its an accurate depiction of Zuckerberg and his creation is open to debate but ultimately meaningless. Whether its an essential look at how contemporary society functions is beyond question.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Social Network opens with a scene -- already justly celebrated -- in which a college-age couple sits in a darkened Cambridge restaurant and discusses their relationship. Face to face no typing involved How quaint. Its not going well for the guy a weedy focused sort named Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) who talks as if hes trying to break the sound barrier and assumes his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) will keep up. She doesnt and after a while her eyes go dead and shes not his girlfriend anymore.Angered he goes back to his dorm and does what any self-respecting sophomore software geek would do insults her on his blog and invents a program that lets users vote on the hottest freshman woman in Harvards photo database. This is the movies hero or anti-hero and your own response to David Finchers brilliantly assured blithely fictionalized drama about the founding of Facebook.com will depend on whether you can appreciate a story in which the main character is so pathologically unsocialized yet so commanding. That might even be the point -- that what a generation now calls ""socializing is in fact the loneliest most self-absorbed activity of all.But ""The Social Network has more on its mind than Mark Zuckerberg or the version of Zuckerberg that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has derived from the Ben Mezrich book ""The Accidental Billionaires and other sources. The film is very much about belonging and wanting to belong -- about the desperate need to be part of the in-crowd and the complacency of those already there. Like Finchers ""Zodiac ""The Social Network sprawls with characters almost all of them male deluded entitled and craving what the others have got. If you dont see the comedy here youll probably think youre watching a horror movie.Zuckerberg for instance would kill to belong to one of Harvards elite final clubs which the movie hilariously paints as dens of Junior League depravity. By contrast his upper-crust classmates the Winklevoss twins -- both Tyler and Cameron played in a sly bit of digital trickery by one actor Armie Hammer -- need a lowly computer nerd to realize their idea for a campus-wide online social network. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the Napster cofounder who becomes Zuckerbergs mentor late in the movie just wants to stick it to the business world that stuck it to him.Caught in the middle and the closest the movie comes to an audience surrogate is Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) Zuckerbergs closest friend and chief financial officer. Eduardo is potentially a member of all of these groups and thus ends up in virtually none of them and Garfield on tap to be the next Spider-Man recognizes the dark farce in Eduardos dilemma and keeps him from becoming a sap. But all the acting is razor-sharp from Timberlakes paranoid slickster to Hammers delightful double turn as rich-boy jocks who think they can win using daddys Ivy League rules to the regally thuggish Douglas Urbanski as Harvard president Lawrence Summers. Unexpectedly Eisenberg comes of age as an actor here; its doubtful anyone will mistake him for Michael Cera again. Impatience insecurity and imperiousness radiate from his Zuckerberg in brutally measured amounts and the characters tunnel vision fuels both his isolation and his arrogance. Facebook becomes the self-centered social world he cant have in real life -- thats the websites addictive genius -- yet even then hes more creator than participant. This Zuckerberg is a Charles Foster Kane with Aspergers a notion Sorkins script embraces in ways both subtle (Garfields Saverin could be a stand-in for Jed Leland) and glib (the final image as easy as it is devastating).All that ""The Social Network lacks is a strong female presence Brenda Song as Eduardos girlfriend doesnt quite graduate from her status as Disney Channel princess and Mara (soon to be seen as Lizbeth Salander in Finchers ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) isnt onscreen enough. Again thats partly the point Almost to a man the characters in this movie do what they do to win over women (which is putting it politely). And almost to a man they displace their energies into swordfights with other men (which is putting it politely).On the level of craft the movies just absurdly enjoyable. Sorkins dialogue dazzles; the photography is burnished and sleek; the editing confidently sorts out a complex narrative that bounces between the primary story line of Facebooks creation (taking place from 2003 to Zuckerbergs assuming the mantle of Americas youngest billionaire in 2008) and not one but two legal depositions. The action both within the hallowed halls of Harvard and on the battlefields of Silicon Valley is given impetus and urgency by the score a work of seductive rock electronica from Atticus Ross and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. The film moves like a shark but its hardly soulless.Instead it coolly wonders what a generation of Internet entrepreneurs are doing with their souls and ours. In one of the deposition sequences -- the dialogue taken verbatim from actual transcripts -- an old-money lawyer asks the distracted Zuckerberg if he has his attention. The kid coldly replies ""You have a part of my attention. You have the minimal amount and we get a glimpse of the aggrieved datasets roaring through the characters mind.

The events of The Social Network the opening-night film of this years New York Film Festival (which well review in next weeks issue) begin during the fall of that year and bring us up to the present day. Recounting the rocky rise to world domination of Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg The Social Network is so of-the-moment that the White Stripes counts as a period signifier. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Fetishizing scraps of facts as if a greater truth can be found in the minute rather than the metaphor director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin approach the zeitgeist as a beast thats left fresh tracks to talk about ""the way we live now"" they retrace step by step just how we arrived here. With actual journalism in transition--some would say in peril--dramatic films like The Social Network are in a sense filling a void left by the demolition of investigative news taking a journalistic approach to fictionalized entertainment constructing stories that lay out evidence reveal sources and respect chronology. Its moviemaking as a magazine cover story. Like in the 1970s another time of financial crisis and protracted military engagement it seems things have gotten so tangled that many filmmakers cant wait to start the untying. (See The Queen The Battle for Haditha even The Hurt Locker.)The gold standard for factually constructed present tense filmmaking is Alan J. Pakulas All the Presidents Men. Thirty-four years after its release the film has lost none of its experiential punch. Made in 1976 less than two years after President Nixons resignation it captured America in a different maelstrom of the present though also dazed and confused as to how it all turned out so badly. Pakula and screenwriter William Goldman much like Fincher broke up a puzzling reality and put it together one piece at a time. They looked closely embraced the banality of the workplace as a baseline and depicted the reporting process in what seems like real-time rather than reductive montage. Woodward and Bernstein spend as much time on the phone or pecking at a typewriter as they do sneaking out for shadowy meetings with Deep Throat. Despite the fact that its revelations are no longer a national secret All the Presidents Men still works in the moment even as its so clearly of a moment.(This is not often the case. As with magazine features most movies that trade in hot-button current events have a short shelf-life. Take Oliver Stones recent W. While ripped from the headlines and providing a quick-draw portrait of a sitting president W. lacked a certain journalistic vigilance--having more in common with Stones historical fictions J.F.K. and Nixon films not as interested in facts as they are in psychological conjecture.)The contemporary films that The Social Network most closely recalls are Shattered Glass (2003)--the true story of another inscrutable morally mercurial twentysomething upstart--and Michael Manns The Insider (1999). Manns film is a pre-millennial paranoid thriller about big tobacco corporate malfeasance legal maneuvering and the degraded standards of a revered news show (60 Minutes). The Insider has a gossipy mildly salacious behind-the-scenes quality similar to Finchers film with plot points that nevertheless arise from unsexy court injunctions editorial redactions and cell phone conversations. As a relevant piece of factual fiction Manns film rang the alarm for its late-90s era warning of rampant corporate power that could and did ensnare employees consumers government officials the judiciary and the press a sorry state that led millions of Americans to vote for Ralph Nader in the next years presidential election.More than a decade later The Social Network shows that its no longer corporate entitlement that keeps us up at night (though it still should) but rather a public-sphere busting Internet. So how does one make a drama of and about the information age--an age of physical inactivity and visual inertia--move? How can you get an exciting scene out of e-mail? The truth is that its not really a stretch. Film is essentially the advance of information at a speed faster than we can process flipping forward by frames and edited together by design. Fincher uses the rapidity of film recording to articulate the speed of media. He shoots a telephone exchange as a standard shot/reverse shot cutting between two characters to mirror and contrast hastening cuts as the exchange becomes clipped creating suspense through rhythm and by simply materially riding the waves of conversation.Not just chronicling the times but emulating them Fincher barely ever lets Zuckerberg be alone. Though The Social Network takes an angle on the boy billionaire its not really a character study or reflective biography--it provides no back-story or psychological skeletons upon which to flesh out a narrative. This is both out of choice and necessity an of-the-moment impression without the traditional biopic over-reach. If anything Zuckerberg is a composite hastily and self-servingly sketched a model and martyr for the true present a man without privacy and yet unknowable. Without the luxury/constraints of hindsight or historical context Fincher and Sorkins story builds power through distance through a strictly objective eye as if the film were capturing rather than making a reality. (Of course its doing the latter Just as our collective memory of Watergate includes Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford so will we look back on Generation Facebook with a vision of Jesse Eisenberg in a hoodie and shower shoes.) Like All the Presidents Men The Social Network doesnt will meaning onto the material but allows meaning to arise from accumulated circumstance. In other words The Social Network succeeds per journalisms most basic directive in showing not telling. And like great journalism a great film can capture the reality of the present--and even make art out of it.2 Jesse Eisenberg and Joseph Mazzello in ""The Social Network.""Merrick Morton Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Eric Hynes Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Hoberman According to The Social Network You Are Definitely Not the Only Asshole on Facebook Wednesday September 29 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Newark public schools or Doctors Without Borders?Merrick Morton A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Social Network is a wonderful title at once Olympian in its detachment and self-descriptive in its buzz. Everyone will opine (and Tweet) on this Scott Rudin-produced Aaron Sorkin-scripted David Fincher-directed universally anticipated tale of Facebooks genesis and founding genius--at least until something sexier comes along.The main talking point is the movies unlovable protagonist. As written by Sorkin and played by Jesse Eisenberg Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg is a character far more compelling than his story. Insensitive paranoid humorless and implacably driven Zuckerberg may not be the years most irritatingly arrogant cine sad sack but he is the most formidable--however grandiose neither Ben Stillers Greenberg nor Ron Bronsteins Daddy Longlegs became a billionaire at age 25.A sort of mildly autistic Sammy Glick with a grim 1000-yard glare Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as the dog in the manger keeping the audience at arms length while ferociously guarding his screen space against all comers. The first thing we learn about the ungainly Harvard sophomore yammering away at his date (Rooney Mara) while hunched over a table in a crowded Boston bar is that he scored a perfect 1600 on his SATs. The next thing is that hes obsessed with gaining entrance into one of Harvards ultra-exclusive final clubs.This pre-credit scene ends with Zuckerberg driving the fresh-faced co-ed to break up with him then and there ""Youre going to be successful and rich. But youre going to go through life thinking that girls dont like you because youre a tech geek. I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that wont be true Itll be because youre an asshole."" Her name is ""Erica"" but in the context of The Social Network it should be ""Rosebud."" Wounded Zuckerberg retreats to his dorm room and after insulting the girl personally on his blog avenges himself on her gender by instantly (and drunkenly) devising a website to rate all Harvard women by hotness. The site draws so much traffic from his fellow students (visualized in party-down mode as Zuck programs) that it crashes the Harvard computer system.Erica is not impressed. (When Zuckerberg attempts a maladroit apology she sarcastically wishes him ""good luck with your video game."") But others are notably a supercilious pair of upper-class upperclassmen the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer). The golden boys invite Zuckerberg into the foyer of their finalist of final clubs and enlist him in their scheme to create a Harvard-only version of then-reigning social network sites like MySpace and Friendster (""Girls want to go with guys who go to Harvard""); outsider Zuck appreciates the appeal of Crimson exclusivity and funded by his dorm-mate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) runs with it. Facebook is born. The Social Networks first act is its best--a hellishly precise youth movie rattling along on a clamor of computer jargon. Applying a Zodiac-level love of detail and subtly expressionist lighting to another sort of petri dish Fincher produces a rich gaseous atmosphere. His Harvard is at once cold and cozy electric with possibility and oppressively organized according to arcane internal castes--although I have to wonder at what temperature an actual alum like Andrew Bujalski would have served this material. Suffering through ""Caribbean Night"" at his declasse Jewish frat Zuckerberg tells Saverin that theyre taking ""the entire social experience of college online."" Facebook.com will be a virtual final club with them as presidents.Difficult not to root for this graceless parvenu to overturn the system especially since the self-entitled Winklevoss lads make even Harvards then-president the execrable Larry Summers (played to the hilt by Rush Limbaugh fill-in Douglas Urbanski) look good; its additionally enjoyable to see Zuck blithely confound a succession of high-powered lawyers once the bamboozled Winklevosses file suit. But here the narrative stumbles. Saverin eventually sued Zuckerberg as well and drawing on Ben Mezrichs novelistic history The Accidental Billionaires itself largely dependent on Saverins story Sorkin flashes forward to the discovery processes of both suits. The depositions prompt a succession of clumsy chronological legally approved flashbacks Zuckerberg leaves Harvard for New York and then under the Mephistophelean influence of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) Palo Alto. Its there that Zuckerberg takes Facebook galactic--half a billion users and potential movie-ticket buyers--but once the charismatic Parker appears Fincher and Sorkin cede the film to him along with his patsy the pathetically duped Saverin. (""I was your only friend"" he whines as silent Zuckerberg scrunches further into his private void wondering what it was he did.)While Zuckerberg grows increasingly enigmatic Parker gets to make the flashy pronouncements--""Private life is a relic of a bygone time. . . . Now were going to live on the Internet""--and is even credited with giving Zuckerberg the idea for his notorious business card (""Im CEO . . . bitch""). Parker confesses that back when he was a high school hacker he invented Napster to impress a girl--but its asserted throughout the film that Zuckerberg is driven by something more than a desire for money or sex or even a monstrous sense of spite. He thinks he wants to be cool but like everyone else he just wants to be loved (though he doesnt know it). Corny as that is the films nadir comes when Zuckerbergs pretty young lawyer comforts him (or us) with the mealy-mouthed observation ""Youre not an asshole Mark. Youre just trying so hard to be one.""As dramatized in The Social Network the story of Facebooks founding is not unlike that of any large corporation--megalomania rewarded sweethearts trampled partners buggered. Zuckerbergs real achievement however was something more mysterious than a 21st-century MGM or Standard Oil; he manufactured intimacy through the creation of a parallel personalized Internet offering an ongoing second life in a virtual gated community. True to its moment The Social Network is less interested in mapping this new system of human interaction than psychoanalyzing it through its quintessential user Zuckerberg.Like any form of entertainment Facebook succeeds to the degree that it compensates people for something missing in their lives--a lost sense of neighborhood or extended family or workplace solidarity. The key insight in The Social Network is that Zuckerberg--not particularly friendly and not at all prone to sharing--created his virtual community for the same reason Kafkas self-starved Hunger Artist found his metier because there was never any food he liked to eat.

"Easy to like Finchers Facebook origin story - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Easy to like Finchers Facebook origin storyThe Social Networka3A1/2 starsSeptember 28 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAcross far too many stretches of our moviegoing lives we see movie after movie without seeing one that really moves. At once stealthy and breathlessly paced ""The Social Network"" scoots at a fabulous clip depicting how its version of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made his billions -- and according to various allegations and two key depositions whom Zuckerberg aced out of those billions while following his digital yellow brick road. Is director David Finchers film the stuff of greatness? Not quite. But the picture is very very good. Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin do not at first appear to be a match made in heaven. Sorkin is relentlessly verbal Fincher fastidiously pictorial. The meticulous sinister mise-en-scene Fincher brought to ""Seven"" ""Fight Club"" and ""Zodiac"" informs the atmosphere here albeit in a subtler way. (The musical score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross insinuates on the sly making Zuckerbergs ambition the stuff of emptiness looking for fulfillment.) The worlds we see on screen primarily Harvard University a few years ago and the sweaty sunny dot.com Palo Alto landscape a little more recently feel -- deliberately -- as remote and exotic as anything in Finchers "" The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" The theater director William Gaskill always said to treat classics like new plays and new plays as if they were classics. The way Fincher depicts Zuckerbergs supersonic but-at-what-cost-to-his-soul? rise its as if were watching a tense comedy of manners from another century when ""friend"" wasnt yet the worlds most dubious verb. The movie begins with a nine-minute doozy of a scene a one-act play really set in a noisy Cambridge bar. The boy-man destined to create Facebook is about to get dumped. Harvard undergrad Zuckerberg played as an exquisitely ambiguous riddle by Jesse Eisenberg sits across a table from his girlfriend ( Rooney Mara). The motormouth we hear in action as Mark patronizes her non-Harvard self bears out her characterization of him as ""exhausting."" The scene ends with her delivery of the thesis line ""Youre probably going to be a very successful computer person."" Then she calls him an a-hole. The note is struck; the films challenge met with impressive confidence and very few audience concessions is to make the central figure interesting without falling prey to cheap plays for our sympathy. That night drunk Zuckerberg blogs about his ex and in short order he hacks into the universitys system to download female students pictures as part of a ""Whos hot? Whos not?"" voting game. Zuckerbergs techno-acumen assured hes asked by the identical twins and future Olympic rowers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss ( Armie Hammer playing both parts -- it wouldnt be a Fincher film without some digital wizardry) to help create a Harvard-focused social networking site. On the down-low Zuckerberg takes his mad programming skills elsewhere and with financial help from Zuckerbergs classmate Eduardo ( Andrew Garfield the films sympathetic conscience) something called ""thefacebook"" is born. The first scenes prophecy becomes truth. Did Zuckerberg steal someone elses idea? His line on that in one deposition scene ""They came to me with an idea; I had a better one."" Justin Timberlake portrays Napster co-founder Sean Parker who gets in on the Facebook action and entices Zuckerberg with promises of billions not to mention women wine song and drugs (though Zuckerbergs more or less disinterested in all that; he lives to code). Timberlake is excellent at these sorts of bad boys. As good as Eisenberg and Garfield are Timberlake is likely to attract the most attention. He is Zuckerbergs siren the father figure (not much older than Zuckerberg) who crows ""Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by"" in between cocaine-induced flights of paranoia. Does the film play fast and loose with the facts? Yes. Most biopics do and this isnt even a conventional biopic. And thats why it feels like something different. Its tone is rueful skeptical bittersweet. Sorkins facility with dialogue prevents the portentious visual quality from sitting on everything too heavily. Shot on digital video the movies beautiful as lighted in shadowy oak-paneled tones by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth but Harvard looks terrifyingly insular -- like Hogwarts without the camaraderie.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDavid Finchers anti-social approach to the filming of...September 24 2010Facebook makes big deal of milestoneJuly 21 2010Film wins no fans at FacebookSeptember 13 2010Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg braces for The Social NetworkSeptember 26 2010Analysis Facebook insider lockup ending share impact seen...August 15 2012Find More Stories AboutZodiacArmie HammerTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0928-social-network-review-20100928,0,7150226.column",200,thesocialnetwork35,thesocialnetwork,chicagotribune

Thats what Mark Zuckerberg the 26-year-old billionaire founder of Facebook did last Friday. He insists that the alignment of his Winfrey windfall with the world premiere of The Social Network at the New York Film Festival was purely coincidental. That could be true. But few may believe him so unflattering is his portrait. The briefest summary of this fast caustic super-brainy entertainment is that Zuckerberg then a 19-year-old sophomore at Harvard College was a brilliant prickly loner -- ""He doesnt have three friends to rub together"" a rival says -- who created a website that gave him at last count 500 million friends. Zuckerberg can be seen as a disabled hero like a legless man who invents a better wheelchair or a tragically flawed king like Superman with a Kryptonite chip embedded in his brain. Either way the film says geniuses are abnormal. The obsessive focus that these blessed cursed minds bring to their goals often excludes social peripheral vision. They dont notice or care about the little people in their way. Zuckerberg incarnated by Jesse Eisenberg (The Squid and the Whale Zombieland) with a single-mindedness so cool as to be lunar isnt inhuman exactly; more post-human a series of calculating algorithms. He is his own computer code -- complex and to most of those who know him unfathomable. To pursue his upward trajectory Zuckerberg must walk in a straight line over live bodies. Did he filch his social-network idea from the Harvard Connection dreamed up by upperclassmen Divya Narendra and twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss? When Facebook went global did Zuckerberg stiff his roommate business partner and closest friend Eduardo Saverin out of the hundreds of millions of dollars Saverin deserved as the companys CFO? The Social Network which plays out these issues via their ensuing overlapping lawsuits doesnt exactly arbitrate but its sympathies are clear enough. As written by Aaron Sorkin (Syracuse class of 83) and directed by David Fincher (did not attend college) the movies Mark Zuckerberg is a genius -- and as nearly everyone in the film calls him an asshole. (See Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher on the making of The Social Network.) If you want to embarrass any adult show him what he was like as a teenager. The real Zuckerberg in his brief stint at Harvard was in some ways mature beyond his or anyones years and in other ways a clumsy adolescent. As revealed in e-mails leaked on the Internet and cited in a recent New Yorker profile he boasted a vindictive streak nearly as impressive as his intelligence. The young man whose site popularized friend as a verb was also fond of another F word. When asked in an e-mail how Facebook acquired its information from Harvard students he replied ""people just submitted it ... i dont know why ... they trust me ... dumb f___s."" And when quizzed on his plan of action against the Winklevosses ""im going to f___ them."" He had a great notion whether it was his or not and the business instincts to bring it to fruition. Earlier Internet entrepreneurs made millions of dollars selling sex; Zuckerberg would make billions selling friends -- and if need be the film reckons selling them out. (See TIMEs 2010 cover story on Facebook.) The opening scene plops the spectator into a Boston restaurant with Zuckerberg and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara soon to be Lisbeth Salander in Finchers remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Worst date ever. He rattles off imperious judgments like Triumph the Insult College Dog (""You dont have to study ... because you go to B.U."") while she tries shooting down his helium-filled self-regard (""What part of Long Island are you from -- Wimbledon?""). Erica finally announcing that theyre no longer a couple is the first to toss Zuckerberg down the A-hole. Shes exasperated but even more exhausted. ""Dating you"" she says ""is like dating a Stairmaster."" Shes Sisyphus and hes the rock. Angry at being dumped by Erica Zuckerberg gets drunk and at his dorm computer has a purely adolescent inspiration FaceMash a college site that displays photos of two coeds and urges participants to vote on whos hot and whos not. This earns him a reprimand from school officials for the crime of hacking and a visit from those tall blond handsome jocks Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both guys played in an astonishingly subtle trompe loeil of special effects by Armie Hammer). In most other films set at a college the twins would be the preening privileged Aryans who torture the lonely nerd until he gets his revenge. Here though Zuckerberg is also an overdog the child of a psychiatrist and her dentist husband he attended Phillips Exeter Academy (where he was on the fencing team) and was recruited by AOL and Microsoft before he decided to attend Harvard. Zuckerbergs defense in Fincher and Sorkins version of the Winklevoss trial is that ""they came to me with an idea. I had a better one."" Yet the Winklevii (as Zuckerberg dubs them) claim Zuckerberg misled them for months promising to work on their site while he perfected his own. For help running the business side of ""the Facebook"" as it was then called Zuckerberg turns to his roomie Saverin (Never Let Me Gos Andrew Garfield) a Brazilian Jew with a dazzle quotient Zuckerberg lacks and envies. But Zuckerberg is ahead of his BFFN -- Best Friend for Now -- in seeing the sites potential and finds a slicker ally in Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) co-founder of Napster. Parker who is older by 41/2 years shares Zuckerbergs vision he sees the site as ""a once-in-a-generation holy s____ idea"" suggests that the be dropped from the name (""Just Facebook; its cleaner"") and hooks Zuckerberg up with big-time investors. Without warning Saverin claims in his deposition Zuckerberg cut Saverins 30% share of the company to less than 1%. Parker the smiling coke-addled seducer becomes president of Facebook.

The Social Network By Peter Travers October 14 2010 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Heres a poke to users and nonusers of Facebook The Social Network isnt some yawny visual aid on how the website grew from a few hundred users at Harvard in 2004 to a 2010 global reach of half a billion. The Social Network is a hard-charging beast of a movie with a full tank of creative gas that keeps it humming from start to finish (hell of a middle too). Sure it gives you the facts about how then-Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (a never-better Jesse Eisenberg) made billions by helping technology win the battle against actual human contact. But its also about the nation of narcissists weve become reshaping who we are on Facebook in the hope of being friended by other users who may or may not be lying their asses off. Bracingly smart brutally funny and acted to perfection without exception The Social Network lights up a dim movie sky with flares of startling brilliance. Director David Fincher (Fight Club Seven Zodiac) puts his visual mastery to work on the verbal pyrotechnics in the dynamite dick-swinging script by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) and they both do the best and ballsiest work of their careers. The Social Network gets you drunk on movies again. It deserves to go viral. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> In the films wow of an opener set in 2003 Sorkin speculatively places Mark at a campus bar where he is driving his girlfriend nuts by avoiding eye contact juggling a dozen topics at once and ignoring her reaction to virtually everything. She is Erica and as played like a gathering storm by Rooney Mara winner of the coveted title role in Finchers The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo she is steaming. Its a setup for disaster tech nerd versus the real live girl from Boston University he uses to unload on. Fed up with his condescension and his obsession with getting into one of Harvards elite ""final clubs"" Erica calls him an asshole and splits. A shattered Mark returns to the dorm he shares with Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello) and Chris Hughes (Patrick Mapel) and beer in hand blogs out his festering rage attacking Erica as a flat-chested bitch hacking into photo files of female Harvard undergrads and ranking them on a hotness scale. Out of anger over being socially rejected a social network is born. Who gets the credit/blame? Theres no doubt Mark is the CEO of a Facebook complex currently valued at 25 billion. But dont forget his BFF Brazilian student Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who provided the business plan and early financing. And then theres the memorable Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer with Josh Pence doing duty as a body double). The Winklevi as Mark calls them are blond vikings on the Harvard rowing crew and in their eyes the originators of Facebook. They were the ones who asked Mark to help them build a Harvard computer-dating service. They all successfully sued for a piece of the pie they claim that Mark the Judas screwed them out of when he took his idea to Silicon Valley and global dominance. Not a drop of blood is spilled in The Social Network but you cant miss the scar tissue. As advertised its a tale of sex money genius and betrayal. But can a script based on what Zuckerberg calls ""fiction"" dig out the truth? The films maverick producer Scott Rudin paraphrasing a line from Sorkins A Few Good Men argues that ""there is no such thing as the truth."" He has a point. Thats why Sorkin using research compiled by journalist Ben Mezrich for his book The Accidental Billionaires written concurrently with the script went to court depositions of Zuckerberg Saverin and the Winklevi and created a fact-based structure that gives the movie multiple points of view. The Rashomon idea is inspired and Fincher directs it with thrilling cinematic fervor. How? By effectively giving each character his own Facebook page. Watch the movie and decide who you want to add as a friend. It wont be easy. Sorkin and Fincher come down hard on these characters without skimping on complexity and sympathy. Eisenberg delivers a tour de force nimbly negotiating Sorkins rat-a-tat dialogue and revealing how alienation and loneliness actually fuel Marks ambition. More crucially Eisenberg lets us see the chinks in Marks armor unearthing long-buried feelings when Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) enters the scene ready to take Facebook to the next level even if it means leaving Eduardo behind as roadkill. Timberlake is phenomenal a revelation even. You expect him to nail Seans charming hustle and he does working a restaurant meeting with Mark and Eduardo like a twentysomething Dr. Evil. ""A million dollars isnt cool"" he says. ""You know whats cool? A billion dollars."" Sean with a rep for drugs and very young women sinks his hooks in. Hes a seductive Iago to Marks ego-bruised Othello. Its a role to die for and Timberlake the mesmerizer just crushes it. Note to Oscar You need to step up big time for Garfield who plays Eduardo with a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie that is built on ice cool a fact reflected in the haunting visuals achieved digitally by gifted cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and the hypnotic musical road map laid out by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Was Mark jealous that the Harvard final club that rejected him accepted Eduardo? Keep your eyes on Garfield -- hes shatteringly good the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one. The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness they define the dark irony of the past decade. The final image of solitary Mark at his computer has to resonate for a generation of users (the drug term seems apt) sitting in front of a glowing screen pretending not to be alone.

"The Social Network review Facebook movie is great all around |       NJ.com comments The Social Network review Facebook movie is great all around Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 25 2010 at 803 AM updated September 25 2010 at 1247 PM View/Post Comments COLUMBIA PICTURESJesse Eisenberg left and Joseph Mazzello in Columbia Pictures ""The Social Network."" It is the very first scene of ""The Social Network"" -- and anti-hero Mark Zuckerbergs girlfriend is already breaking up with him. It is not she hastens to say because hes a nerd. He is of course - an absolute unreconstructed one. But thats not it. ""Listen. Youre going to be successful and rich but youre going to go through life thinking that girls dont like you because youre a geek"" she says. ""And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that wont be true. ""Itll be because youre an asshole."" Its a great perfectly honed scene and credit it and its rapid-fire dialogue to screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. But it also goes to the heart of the movies irony -- that the boy genius whose Facebook basically invented a new way to connect to people is cluelessly disconnected from everyone. Movie Review THE SOCIAL NETWORK The Social Network (PG-13) Columbia (120 min.)Directed by David Fincher. With Jesse Eisenberg Andrew Garfield. Opens October 1 in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations and drug use. Stephen Whittys review FOUR STARS That it should be emphasized is Sorkins key to the ""drama"" of Mark Zuckerberg. Is it the ""truth"" of Mark Zuckerberg? Who knows? Like ""The Queen"" ""The Social Network"" is one of those movies that cares more about whether something ""feels"" real than whether it is. But it is a fact that Zuckerberg a genuine prodigy basically invented the first truly new form of communication since the telephone. And that arguments over just how much of it he did on his own have led to years of painful lawsuits. And that all of that unfolds here like some sort of classic tragedy updated to the email age -- ""Richard III"" in a hoodie and flipflops ""King Lear"" on Red Bull and Twizzlers. Like all tragedies the plays the thing -- although auteur-minded critics are already falling over director David Fincher. Thats to be expected. Fincher is a natural filmmaker. His images (see ""Se7en"" ""Alien 3"") are rich with shadow. His soundtracks (""Zodiac"") are maps of menace. He is in command here too. The soundscape of ""The Social Network"" is full of rhythm and foreboding (Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails worked on the score). A regatta is marked by a curious depth-of-focus trick that turns everything but crucial elements into a blur. But because Fincher isnt a writer -- or even a director who consistently works with the same writers -- his results are erratic. When hes starting with a great script as in ""Fight Club"" its a great movie. When hes starting with a ""Forrest Gump"" retread like ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" it isnt. Here hes working from a great script. With great actors too although the famously endlessly exacting Fincher could probably squeeze a performance out of a rock. Jesse Eisenberg goes beyond his usual persona of overprivileged smart-alec to suggest someone with layers of resentment even hes barely conscious of. Andrew Garfield last seen in ""Never Let Me Go"" is perfect as Zuckerbergs trusting wounded -- and only -- friend. And a small welcome lift comes from Justin Timberlake playing Napster jester Sean Parker. Riding one bubble after another he is clearly there to use Zuckerberg -- but who really uses whom in the end remains a fascinating subject for debate. COLUMBIA PICTURESJustin Timberlake left and Jesse Eisenberg in Columbia Pictures ""The Social Network."" So does most of the film. Who is Mark Zuckerberg really? More important what does modern intimacy mean if you can have hundreds of ""friends"" youve never met? Whats the line between person and ""persona"" if you can now re-create yourself to suit a site? They are the questions that for better or worse are going to define communications for the next few decades. And the ultimate irony is that were only asking them now because of one Harvard student who never learned to communicate with anyone to begin with.

By David Denby Armie Hammer Jesse Eisenberg and Max Minghella (from left) in a film directed by Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin.   Credit Photograph by Merrick Morton / Columbia Pictures ""The Social Network"" directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin rushes through a coruscating series of exhilarations and desolations triumphs and betrayals and ends with what feels like darkness closing in on an isolated soul. This brilliantly entertaining and emotionally wrenching movie is built around a melancholy paradox in 2003 Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) a nineteen-year-old Harvard sophomore invents Facebook and eventually creates a five-hundred-million-strong network of ""friends"" but Zuckerberg is so egotistical work-obsessed and withdrawn that he cant stay close to anyone; he blows off his only real pal Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) a fellow Jewish student at Harvard who helps him launch the site. The movie is not a conventionally priggish tale of youthful innocence corrupted by riches; nor is it merely a sarcastic arrow shot into the heart of a poor little rich boy. Both themes are there but the dramatic development of the material pushes beyond simplicities and the portrait of Zuckerberg is many-sided and ambiguous; no two viewers will see him in quite the same way. The debate about the movies accuracy has already begun but Fincher and Sorkin selecting from known facts and then freely interpreting them have created a work of art. Accuracy is now a secondary issue. In this extraordinary collaboration the portrait of Zuckerberg I would guess was produced by a happy tension even an opposition between the two men--a tug-of-war between Finchers gleeful appreciation of an outsider who overturns the social order and Sorkins old-fashioned humanist distaste for electronic friend-making and a world of virtual emotions. The result is a movie that is absolutely emblematic of its time and place. ""The Social Network"" is shrewdly perceptive about such things as class manners ethics and the emptying out of self that accompanies a geniuss absorption in his work. It has the hard-charging excitement of a very recent revolution the surge and sweep of big money moving fast and chewing people up in its wake. We know from ""The West Wing"" that Sorkin can write the smartest and swiftest dialogue since Ben Hecht and Preston Sturges. His adrenaline-pumped men and women anticipate one anothers best shots; they fill out or overturn one anothers half-finished sentences answering whats implied rather than simply whats said. Sorkins script for ""The Social Network"" is his best work yet--incisive and witty from moment to moment but expansive over all as a picture of college social life hipster business enterprise friendship and rivalry. But Sorkins particular skills in ""The Social Network"" are familiar. The unexpected element is David Finchers work. The director of ""Fight Club"" ""Zodiac"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a master of sullen menace convulsive violence; he loves creating an aura of the magical and the uncanny. Yet he treats Sorkins real-world situations with extreme delicacy and precision. Fincher has always been obsessed with outsiders and rebels but now in mid-career he has transferred that obsession into a subtler more telling form with both comic and tragic implications. ""The Social Network"" draws on a 2009 book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich. Mezrich also went to Harvard and in both the book and the movie the Harvard lore is laid on a little thick. The eager suburban co-eds trucked in for parties the rabbity competitiveness and status-seeking among the men the terrific excitement of being ""punched"" for one of the all-male ""final clubs"" (off-campus social sites for the chosen elite)--to outsiders all this frenzied self-importance seems slightly mad. Yet the filmmakers dont satirize Harvard and you can see why they needed to re-create the pressures and the social stratifications that led to Zuckerbergs revolt. Fincher has often worked within a frantic boys world--by way of having fun in ""Fight Club"" guys literally punch one another to a pulp--but here the violence is emotional not physical. Watching Zuckerberg and his friends toss beer-bottle caps and ideas at one another in the dorm were meant to think that they really are the brightest (and perhaps the most obnoxious) kids in the country. In the opening scene Zuckerberg tells his lovely and intelligent girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) that he could introduce her a mere Boston University student to important people if he gets into one of the clubs. Hes prickly overprecise condescending; he keeps wrong-footing her and then scolding her for not keeping up. Yet even as he acts like a jerk you feel for him because at some level he wants Erica and the harder he tries to impress her the faster he drives her away. Sorkin created an emotionally stunted closed-off young man and Fincher pulled something touching out of Jesse Eisenberg. Slender with curly light-brown hair and dark-blue eyes Eisenberg pauses stares then rushes ahead talking in bristling clumps like a computer spilling bytes. The self-assurance he gives Zuckerberg is audacious and funny. Its also breathtakingly hostile. Yet after many of Zuckerbergs haughtiest riffs a tiny impulse of regret quivers across his lips. As Zuckerberg and his friends lay siege to computers in marathon sessions--the pace is giddy Becks-enhanced--they turn women into objects even prey. In the end Facebook becomes gender neutral but the movie is sparked by a bitterly comic irony a worldwide social revolution capable of rattling authoritarian governments began with nothing more urgent than the desire of two middle-class Jewish boys to be considered cool at college and meet girls without having to endure the humiliation of campus mixers. By focussing on the moment of creation Fincher and Sorkin are getting at something new. From the first scene to the last ""The Social Network"" hints at a psychological shift produced by the Information Age a new impersonality that affects almost everyone. After all Facebook like Zuckerberg is a paradox a Web site that celebrates the aura of intimacy while providing the relief of distance substituting bodiless sharing and the thrills of self-created celebrityhood for close encounters of the first kind. Karl Marx suggested that in the capitalist age we began to treat one another as commodities. ""The Social Network"" suggests that we now treat one another as packets of information. Mark Zuckerberg as interpreted by this film comes off as a binary personality. As far as hes concerned either youre for him or youre against him. Either you have information that he can use or you dont. Apart from that hes not interested. At Harvard Zuckerberg hacks into the universitys computer system a stunt that gets him into trouble with the administration but also brings him to the attention of the seniors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss who are identical twins and American aristocrats. In a weird touch balanced between derision and awe both brothers are played by the dazzlingly handsome Armie Hammer. Devoted to physical cultivation civility and fair play the twins row at dawn on the Charles River; theyre headed for the Olympics. Yet the Winklevosses--or Winklevi as Zuckerberg calls them--want to get into the social-media business. Zuckerberg strings them along while he and Saverin develop the prototype of Facebook; thats the root of his eventual legal troubles. The movie is framed by the two civil suits brought against Zuckerberg a few years later--one by the Winklevosses who claim that he stole an idea that they had developed with their partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) the other by Saverin whom Zuckerberg may have aced out of the company. The movie is a tightly fitted mosaic of agitated fragments. As the lawyers and the disputants throw verbal darts at one another across a conference-room table the filmmakers repeatedly cut sometimes in mid-sentence first back to Harvard and then to Palo Alto where Zuckerberg lands in the summer of 2004 enticed by the siren song of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the co-founder of Napster. ""Well Im an optimist--I still think peace can be avoided."" Share Tweet Buy a cartoon When Zuckerberg first gets to Silicon Valley hes as unworldly as a cloistered monk. Surrounded by pizza boxes and beer cans and dressed in gray sweats flip-flops and a hoodie he even looks like a monk. But Sean Parker a hustler of genius says to him ""A million dollars isnt cool. You know whats cool? A billion dollars."" And though the hoodie remains everything else changes. Parker who foresees the universal success of Facebook comes off as intelligent but reckless and dissolute--a candy man who brings the goods (venture capital mainly but drugs too). Justin Timberlake with his charm and his physical dynamism and with a wicked visionary gleam in his eye torques the movie even higher. The colors in Jeff Cronenweths cinematography change from Harvard crimson to the electric pink of a San Francisco night club. Yet no matter how quickly the film moves Fincher working with the editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall pauses within the fast tempo and lets the emotional power of the moment expand. Relying on nothing more than tiny shifts of emphasis and inflection the director to an amazing degree makes us care about the split between the unyielding Zuckerberg and Saverin whos a decent guy but unimaginative and perhaps a little timid. As Saverin Andrew Garfield has the emotional fluency--the fear the indignation and the hurt feelings--that Eisenberg has to suppress. In the legal dispute a college prank that was once a joke between them is recalled and used as ammunition and the moment rips what is left of their youth to shreds. ""The Social Network"" is a linear accelerator that breathes and Fincher is the one who created the breathing room. Fincher has been a bit of an outsider himself working at the edge and celebrating inspired screw-ups marginal eccentrics and monsters. Born in Denver in 1962 he grew up in Oregon and Northern California skipped college and at the age of seventeen went to work as a camera operator for the San Francisco independent filmmaker John Korty the director of ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" and other gentle movies. A few years later Fincher moved to George Lucass Industrial Light amp; Magic where he worked on the special effects for ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983) and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984). By his late twenties Fincher had found his own cinematic style in razory provocative and beautiful music videos--for singers like George Michael and most notably Madonna--and in a series of commercials that added exciting and disturbing images to the collective unconscious increasingly fast speed demons (a dog a runner a horse a bullet train) racing across a sunbaked desert for Nike; a fetus slowly and thoughtfully taking a drag on a cigarette for the American Cancer Society. Fincher was never an outsider in the way that say an independent filmmaker like Jim Jarmusch is. But he may be one of the few directors who can flourish as an idiosyncratic artist amid the quarterly-return mentality of the conglomerate-controlled studios. Theres no indication from his work that he has read much or that he has lived much outside the movie world yet hes not thank God another director obsessed with the movie past like the pop-scholastic Quentin Tarantino whose virtuosity with camera mood and tone Fincher more than equals. Fincher has his own obsessions. The 1993 video for Madonnas ""Bad Girl"" is Finchers work in miniature The police enter and examine a corpse (Madonnas)--a visual motif that he returned to in the grisly ""Se7en"" (1995) in which cops repeatedly walk in on deliquescing or bloody corpses. In ""Bad Girl"" Madonna is murdered by a serial killer and both ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"" (2007) are about serial killers. Outside Madonnas apartment Christopher Walken as some sort of angel of death looks at his watch which is running backward. That image became the key visual idea in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008). Fincher is now a demon on the set controlling everything demanding in ""The Social Network"" seventy or eighty takes of a single shot. But like any director working in the mainstream he has to fight to impose himself. He was only twenty-eight when he started on his first feature ""Alien 3"" (1992) and he got pushed around on the set by the studio Fox which then recut the movie. Still theres a peculiar look to this noir sci-fi horror movie with the camera often positioned beneath the actors and tilting up at black or mucky ceilings. Its a look that could have been produced only by a man ornery enough to attempt to have his own way with a prized studio franchise. In ""Se7en"" the first real Fincher film theres a prolonged philosophical dialogue between a pessimistic isolated older cop (Morgan Freeman) and an idealistic life-loving younger one (Brad Pitt). But then at the end a surprise the killer a religious-fundamentalist nut calling himself John Doe shows up in the hyper-articulate person of Kevin Spacey and he turns out to be cogent and comprehensive in his disgust for the world and most of the people in it. Fincher almost makes John Doe a sympathetic character. Sympathy for the devil has always been a productive mood for an artist and particularly for Fincher; he could probably make a thrilling version of Miltons ""Paradise Lost"" with Satan reigning heroically in Hell. Spaceys killer boasts of his ability as a murderer to overturn everyones complacency to disrupt the bourgeois order and a version of that disruption is enacted upon the body and the spirit of Michael Douglass wealthy and pleasureless banker Nicholas Van Orton in Finchers ""The Game"" (1997). Terrible things happen to Van Orton and it turns out that they are all part of an elaborate prank a kind of benevolent shock therapy administered by his kid brother (Sean Penn) in order to jolt him out of middle-aged rigor mortis. Yet what one remembers from the film isnt the reassuring hugs at the end but the way the world falls apart for Van Orton--his pen leaks staining his shirt; bullets whiz around his head; a taxi races down a hill and tosses him into San Francisco Bay. The banker is toyed with--terrorized really. Finchers mischief was taking on a malevolent edge. Genuine terrorism shows up in ""Fight Club"" (1999) which begins with another rant against bourgeois order and conformity. Hoping to escape mediocrity and boredom a depressed corporate worker (Edward Norton) joins a sub-fascist group of disaffected men a band of bloody brothers which grows larger and more organized finally planting bombs. The movie has a wacko happy ending in which the bombs go off bringing down office towers. (Its pre-9/11.) Towers remain standing in ""The Social Network"" but barriers fall; the barbarians not only enter by the gates but destroy them. Every Facebook user Zuckerberg tells Saverin becomes the president of the club and the reign of the Winklevi and their kind is over. At last Fincher has made a movie about a revolution that succeeded. Despite the half-craziness of the themes the early Fincher movies have a visual distinction that makes them galvanic irresistible. Even Finchers patented junk and mess first seen in ""Alien 3"" and then in the rubbishy derelict rooms in ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" has a perversely attractive appeal a glowing awfulness as if it were lit from within. He doesnt hide the disintegrating walls the sordid beds; we are meant to see the ugly poetry in them. Whatever locations he uses Fincher brings out their special character. At the beginning of ""The Social Network"" Zuckerberg runs across the campus to his room at night and Harvard its many enclaves lit with intellectual industry looks glamorous like an imaginary city. The scenes of the Winklevosses in their boat crisply cutting through the water are ineffably beautiful; the twins are at ease in their bodies and in nature while the Zuckerberg gang slouch over their computers in the kind of trashed rooms that Finchers anarchists and killers live in. The revolution brews amid garbage. In the early movies and in ""Panic Room"" (2002) a well-made but meaningless B movie Fincher worked in overdetermined forms with plot arcs as rigid as steel. Formally the outlier in Finchers work is ""Zodiac"" based on the investigation of an actual serial killer in Northern California. Jake Gyllenhaals Robert Graysmith who pursues the murderer for years is another of Finchers inspired outsiders an obsessive who so thoroughly gives himself over to his task that he almost destroys his own life. Graysmith comes very close to cracking the case but in the end proof falls maddeningly out of his grasp. ""Zodiac"" feels open-ended. It lasts more than two and a half hours but it might have gone on for hours more; it accumulates a series of suspicions rather than working toward a simple resolution. The truth Fincher seems to be saying is best approached with data impressions and interpretations. The double-deposition scenes in ""The Social Network"" would also seem to be a way of attaining proof but again truth slips away. Fincher and Sorkin have turned a philosophical position into a dramatic strategy. We see the events of 2003 and 2004 from different sides--Zuckerbergs Saverins the Winklevosses--and all the self-serving versions have a degree of validity. The movies evenhandedness forces us to make our own judgments. For instance Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss despite their hilarious double perfection are never caricatured as muscle-bound jocks. They understand the idea of a social-dating site. What they lack is Zuckerberg and Parkers intuitive apprehension of it as a new form of virtual social life. Fincher and Sorkin treat the brothers as squarely honorable traditionalists. They go to see Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski) then the president of Harvard to complain about Zuckerberg and one can feel in this seemingly unimportant scene history falling into place a shift from one kind of capitalism to another. Fincher and Sorkin wickedly imply that Summers is Zuckerberg thirty years older and many pounds heavier. He has the same kind of brightest-guy-in-the-room arrogance and little sympathy for entitled young men talking about ethics when theyve been left behind by a faster innovator. Zuckerbergs tragedy of course is that he leaves behind his friends as well as his intellectual inferiors. It may not be fair to Zuckerberg but Sorkin and Fincher have set him up as a symbolic man of the age a supremely functional prince of dysfunction. Charles Foster Kane was convivial and outgoing; Zuckerberg engages only the world he is creating. But those viewers who think of him as nothing more than a vindictive little shit will be responding to only one part of him. Hes a revolutionary because he broods on his personal grievances and as insensitive as he is reaches the aggrieved element in everyone the human desire for response. Hes meant to be a hero--certainly hes Finchers hero an artist working in code who sticks to his vision and is helpless to prevent himself from suffering the most wounding personal loss.

Like Bueller Zuckerberg lives his life free from any rules except his own. He replaces Buellers charisma with pure stamina however reflecting Glicks relentless drive to overcome competition despite impossible odds. But Bueller and Glick unlike Zuckerberg both exist exclusively in the fictional realm. Glick stems from Budd Schulbergs seminal 1941 novel about a Hollywood moguls rise to fame and Bueller comes from the youth-sensitive mind of John Hughes. Nevertheless the real Zuckerberg has little to do with his onscreen manifestation beyond providing the original source material. In ""The Social Network"" Zuckerberg has symbolic definition epitomizing the power lust of a nascent generation for the first time in its short history. Scripted by Aaron Sorkin the movie owes much to the rapid-fire chatter now considered ""The West Wing"" creators trademark. Tossing around the initial outline for Facebook in Harvard dorm rooms Zuckerberg and his peers engage in hyper-intelligent technobabble at a sizzling pace at times suggesting the rhythms of a Preston Sturges comedy without the constant yuks. Sorkin cleverly spoofs Ivy League elitism with better accuracy than ""Good Will Hunting"" by injecting it with adrenaline. The pre-credits opening break-up scene where Zuckerbergs frustrated girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) dumps him for patronizing her instantly establishes Sorkins meteoric universe. The conversation flies in four or five directions at once addressing Zuckerbergs desire to access Harvards exclusive ""final clubs"" the IQ levels of people in China and whether or not Erica would prefer athletic students on the crew team instead of scrawny guys like him. Real people (none that I know anyway) dont exactly talk like this but again ""The Social Network"" has more to do with the way contemporary twentysomethings perceive each other and themselves than the reality of their discourse. For a world predominantly occupied by guys in their early twenties ""The Social Network"" is an unconventional contender for the headiest American movie of the year. ""The ability to make money doesnt impress anyone around here"" Zuckerberg says illustrating that his goals lie further from wealth than complete world domination. The origin for Facebook recounted in Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaire"" implies Zuckerberg started the site to meet girls but Sorkins adaptation attributes Zuckerbergs secret to a searching for the greatest idea ever. ""You are probably going to be a very successful computer person"" Erica says just before calling him an asshole. For the remainder of the running time Zuckerberg appears intent on turning that epithet into a badge of honor. Before all else this characterization gives ""The Social Network"" its underlying zeitgeist appeal. Set in the fall of 2003 the story is littered with period specificity. Technology still loomed large seven years ago but the details were different. The dominant platforms for online interaction were MySpace and Friendster. Nobody sported an iPhone or browsed YouTube. Today most plugged-in young people assume they live in public but Zuckerberg sounds surprised when a friend knows he got dumped -- forgetting that he blogged about it two hours earlier. Zuckerberg alone may not have changed that but he puts a tangible face on a massive linguistic shift. By regularly flashing forward to the two lawsuits he met in the wake of launching the site the movies structure acknowledges Zuckerbergs overnight popularity. His longtime friend and former business partner Eduardo Saverin (future ""Spider-Man"" Andrew Garfield) rages against Zuckerberg for diminishing his friends stake in the company while a pair of uptight Harvard twins claim Zuckerberg stole their idea. Sorkin makes it look like everyones partially right but Zuckerberg remains either indifferent to the complaints of his former colleagues or completely impervious to their threats a superhero for aspiring entrepreneurs everywhere. Regardless of its new media backdrop ""The Social Network"" has a polished framework that makes its dense proceedings go down with ease. The sex and drugs come with the territory but also add a sensationalistic dimension that hints at the dangers courting Zuckerberg as his stature grows. Sorkin attributes the hedonistic indulgences not to his main subject but rather to Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the devil on Zuckerbergs shoulder whose role in Facebooks early years ended with a cocaine bust. Parker comes across as a pompous hustler whose egomania veers into delusional territory leading to a neat juxtaposition with Zuckerbergs focused pragmatism. The least disciplined of the bunch Parker naturally gets Sorkins most ridiculous lines. ""This is a once-in-a-generation-holy-shit idea"" he exclaims during Facebooks early stage of integration. And then ""Private behaviors a relic of time gone by."" Would anyone say that on the fly? Sorkin makes the case that these guys might. Playing along with his screenwriters tendency toward dramatic overstatement Fincher directs the movie with the epic aspiration of capturing change in action. A pummeling score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross frequently introduces the makings of an espionage tale with Zuckerberg literally hacking his way to the top. The breathless rate at which ""The Social Network"" operates from its very first frame has a kinship with Christopher Nolans equally speedy technique but Fincher makes his saga both mesmerizing and fun. Although he moves forward with a constant pulsing momentum and never stops in doing so he accurately represents the thrill of sudden inspiration. At one point Zuckerberg has an epiphany about the importance of including relationship statuses in Facebook profiles; he dashes home to his dorm room tripping through the snow. Its an unusually exhilarating moment one that should resonate for people in Zuckerbergs age bracket. Eisenberg has played overambitious nerdy types before (his performance as an awkward teen in ""Adventureland"" could be seen as an audition reel for his latest role) but with Zuckerberg the actor finds an ideal outlet for his strengths. Speeding up his familiar muttering to a stream-of-consciousness prattle he becomes the perfect counterpoint to Garfields sober-eyed innocence. The only blatant caricatures come from the Winklevoss twins a spoiled cartoonishly buff pair (both hilariously portrayed by Armie Hammer) whose anger sounds painfully blunt. ""Lets get the frickin nerd"" one of them says after his brother pouts about Zuckerbergs alleged riff on their own social networking concept. By contrast everything Zuckerberg spouts has curious wisdom to it. ""Its not going to be finished"" he says of Facebooks development ""the way fashion is never finished."" Positioning Facebook as a state of mind Zuckerberg delivers the foundation for its underlying identity. While not exactly likable hes admirably determined and notably avoids facing his flaws by refusing to apologize to everyone he leaves behind. With business cards that read ""Im CEO bitch"" and a company that generates 25 billion Zuckerberg wears his luxuries on his sleeve revealing the asshole/nerd distinction established in the introductory scene as merely an illusion. Therein lies the generational statement. Zuckerbergs habitual smugness is his defining factor a forceful slapdown to older figures (""The Social Network"" contains hardly any of them) intent on scoffing at his sense of initiative. The non-fictional Zuckerberg has publicly expressed his displeasure with the project but theres no reason why he shouldnt try to appreciate the depth of his involuntary cinematic presence. With Zuckerberg Fincher and Sorkin have found the first true twenty-first century anti-hero. The shift in online communication had already begun when Facebook hit the scene predating Zuckerbergs rise by a few years but hes still the right figure to highlight the change. A key scene in the movie shows Zuckerberg and Saverin meet a few Facebook groupies at a Bill Gates lecture. Rather than jot down a phone number the more forward girl makes an original proposal. ""Facebook me"" she says. The boys ecstatic reaction to hearing their homegrown dent in the English language presents the opportunity to witness social mores in the midst of their evolution. The real Zuckerberg need not step forward but he should at least feel a little flattered.

Daily Edition Login to download The Social Network -- Film Review 605 PM PDT 10/12/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A mesmerizing bewildering and infuriating protagonist makes this movie about Facebooks creation a must-see. TWITTER ""The Social Network"" has as its protagonist a character drawn in a Shakespearean mode a high-achieving individual who carries within him the seeds of his own destruction. This would of course be young Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) the man behind the social-network phenomenon Facebook. As the movie makes abundantly clear the facts behind its founding are in dispute but without a doubt Zuckerberg did create Facebook. Yet far from celebrating this feat the movie examines how a man who cares little about money became the worlds youngest billionaire yet lost his one true friend. At least thats what the movie says happened. The film written by Aaron Sorkin is based on Ben Mezrichs book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" and Sorkins own research yet neither writer predictably was able to talk to Zuckerberg to get his point of view. So it is as a fictional construct -- based on ample public sources however -- that ""Mark Zuckerberg"" achieves its Shakespearean dimension. He gains the whole world but loses his most meaningful asset because of a fatal flaw on view in the very first scene. ""Social"" has the potential to be that rarity -- a film that gains critical laurels and award mentions yet also does killer boxoffice. Certainly Sorkin the films director David Fincher and its heavyweight producers have crafted a smart insightful film that satisfies both camps. The hook is the films of-the-moment topic but the payoff is its hero. Or antihero or villain or whatever. The very first scene? Harvard undergrad Mark and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) are trying to have a dinner date at a noisy Cambridge brew pub. Or at least shes trying. Hes talking a mile a minute with every syllable screaming egocentricity and dripping with sarcasm and defensive insecurity. She cant even change the topic. Indeed she cant even tell what the topic is. After one insult too many its easier for Erica to break up with Mark. So the flaw is most ironic -- the guy who will revolutionize the way people communicate cant communicate himself. He is virtually blind to anyone elses perspective. Pissed off Mark jogs home to get drunk hit his computer and to take his mind off Erica accidentally invents Facebook. Okay its not Facebook; its Facemash a stupid idea that only a genius computer hacker/scientist would dream up in which he hacks into Harvards computer system downloads all photos from the ""facebooks"" of the universitys houses and asks students to vote on which girls are the hottest. The contest goes viral crashes Harvards computer system earns Mark a reprimand from authorities but attracts the attention of Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence with the help of special effects). These are wealthy and privileged scholar-athletes trying to develop an inner-campus website to create a place for students to meet greet and perhaps score dates. They approach the anarchist-hacker who is intrigued by their idea but prefers to go to his best friend and fellow Jew Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) to finance a social network that contains elements of the Winklevosses idea but transforms it into what we now know as Facebook. Then the rest of the movie in an inspired move by Sorkin takes place at legal depositions. Because a few years later Facebook is a billion-dollar miracle and lawsuits are flying everywhere The twins and their Indian-American partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella who doesnt look or act Indian) and Eduardo who has been frozen out of Facebook thanks to the Svengali-like efforts of Napster creator Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) are all suing Mark. As everyone recollects his version of events the film flashes back to these developments. You understand no ones testimony is reliable but Sorkin tries to sort out the possible scenario that lands everyone in this legal soup. The story thus becomes a tale of power fame betrayal revenge and responsibility. Under Finchers astute direction the characters fairly pop out at you. Even in a one-scene performance famed Harvard president Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski) startles the viewer with his abrupt impatience and sterling wit as he dismisses the twins heavy-handed attempt to enlist the school in their cause. Fincher also places events in milieus that ring true. His portrait of campus life among Americas elite is pitch-perfect every bit as much as the drug-and-party excesses of Silicon Valley and the war rooms of corporate attorneys. There have been complaints from early screenings that no one is very likable in this movie. Youll get no argument here but thats beside the point. ""Mark Zuckerberg"" is thoroughly unlikable but he is an original. Ask yourself How many truly original characters show up in American movies? Mark exists in his own world. He dresses like he just rolled out of bed and doesnt relate to people half as well as he does to computers algorithms and user databases. He finds people at best helpful to his creations or at worst annoying. He cannot speak civilly to anyone yet has the verbal skills to hone in on sore points with his acquaintances. His oral jousting with the deposing attorneys is brilliantly rendered in dialogue Sorkin presumably lifted from transcripts. About the only character that comes off well is Garfields Eduardo. The guy seems to care genuinely about his ex-friend and is bitterly unhappy about his treatment by Mark. Everyone else is borderline manic such as Eduardos sweet-and-sour girlfriend played by a Brenda Song. The production is the best studios can offer with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross hypnotically repetitive score Jeff Cronenweths fluid sparkling cinematography and Donald Graham Burts pinpoint-accurate production design all major pluses. Theres no flaw here.So the film comes down to a mesmerizing portrait of a man who in any other age would perhaps be deemed nuts or useless but in the Internet age has this mental agility to transform an idea into an empire. Yet he still cannot rule his own life to the point he doesnt lose whats important to him. At least thats what the movie says.

A very modern story inspires a classic study in ego greed and the slippery nature of American enterprise in ""The Social Network"" David Finchers penetrating account of the accidental founding of Facebook. Moving like a speedboat across two hours of near-nonstop talk scribe Aaron Sorkins blow-by-blow deconstruction of how Harvard computer whiz Mark Zuckerberg (and friends) stumbled on a multibillion-dollar phenomenon continues Finchers fascinating transition from genre filmmaker extraordinaire to indelible chronicler of our times. Savvy moviegoers will need no persuading but critical enthusiasm and sustained media attention should upgrade ""Network"" to major-player status among the years fall releases. To those who initially scoffed at the notion of anyone much less the director of ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"" making an interesting film about the Internets most ubiquitous social-networking site Fincher has delivered a terrifically entertaining rejoinder; Sony can rely on strong word of mouth to stimulate general interest in what will likely be referred to for better or worse as ""the Facebook movie."" After ""Zodiac"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" two big-canvas pictures with unusually cerebral themes for mainstream studio fare its great to see the director engaging the zeitgeist in a film that offers the old-school satisfactions of whip-smart dialogue meaty characterizations and an unflagging sense of momentum. Finchers style here is not far from the procedural rigor of ""Zodiac"" yet the films cynical sensibility and mile-a-minute line delivery also recall the verbally dexterous comedies of Howard Hawks and Paddy Chayefsky. Ben Mezrichs source text ""The Accidental Billionaires"" offered a loosely reported version of the events that commenced at Harvard in fall 2003 and Sorkin adapts it with a similarly free hand streamlining the material for clarity and effect while penning most of the dialogue from scratch. Sorkins most significant adjustment is to provide Zuckerberg with a fictional girlfriend and thus a very human motive for the actions that eventually spawned Facebook. The five-minute opening sequence a brilliantly sustained volley of insults between Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) and Erica (Rooney Mara) that ends with the former getting dumped establishes the films style. It also introduces Mark -- an awkward borderline-antisocial genius unable to keep a lid on his every petty insecurity and scathing insight -- and places him at the center of a drama that slyly shifts perspectives and sympathies as it progresses. Lashing out at his ex Mark hacks into Harvards photo archives and pulls a server-crashing stunt that lands him in hot water with university administrators. It also captures the attention of twin jocks Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer with a body-double assist by Josh Pence) and their friend Divya (Max Minghella) who ask Mark to program the student-networking site theyre developing. But Mark has another idea -- or perhaps an improvement on their idea. He secretly turns around and launches a conceptually similar site initially known as ""the Facebook"" partnering with best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) a popular good-looking business student with all the financial and social capital Mark lacks. The site becomes a Harvard sensation and turns Mark and Eduardo into overnight celebrities; just as quickly it catches the eye of slick Web entrepreneur and Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). In no time an up-to-the-minute success story has morphed into an all-too-familiar saga of mistrust betrayal retaliation and litigation. Sorkin uses the legal proceedings to frame the action filling the viewer in on the two lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg in the wake of Facebooks stratospheric impact (more than 500 million users worldwide). As the film moves between these taut court scenes and the events described in testimony (editors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxters cross-cutting here is super-sharp) it etches a riveting portrait of the forces at work -- outsider vs. establishment content vs. advertising the desire to create vs. the urge to sabotage to name a few. Finchers direction is a model of coherence and discipline relying on the traditional virtues of camera placement and editing to tell the story and never resorting to any of the stylistic gimmicks the subject matter would seem to invite; Facebook itself is shown fleetingly a decision consistent with the films suspicious attitude toward the whole enterprise. Helmer proves more attentive to nuances of Ivy League culture in which students must reconcile the pressure to fit in with the drive to get ahead as well as the irony of the socially inept Mark (""This guy doesnt have three friends to rub together"" someone notes) somehow masterminding the worlds biggest online gathering. More than anything else ""The Social Network"" is a feast of great talk -- scintillating propositions withering put-downs improbably witty comebacks -- and as such it doesnt always know when to quit. The script can feel overdetermined at times with a tendency to put too fine a point on its ideas; even the bit players are fluent in the hyper-articulate syntax and rippling cadences of Sorkin-speak. But the film is rescued from archness by the humanity of its principals whom Fincher refuses to exalt or demonize. Timberlake makes Sean every inch the brazen opportunist but his neer-do-well grin is positively infectious; Garfield movingly lends the film a strong moral counterweight as the sensible superego to Marks raging id. As the Winklevoss brothers Hammer projects rich-boy entitlement without resorting to preening caricature. Still its Eisenbergs picture. The young actors nebbishy persona found a consummate vessel in the role of Mark and his bone-dry sarcasm lends almost every moment a tetchy unpredictable comic energy. A shifty-eyed creep whose motives cant be reduced to a simple yearning for fame and fortune Mark may be an ""asshole"" as hes called throughout but as Eisenberg beautifully displays in his rare tongue-tied moments hes not entirely without conscience. While Mara more than holds her own opposite Eisenberg the female roles are essentially supportive; Rashida Jones is fine as a member of Marks legal team while Brenda Song brings sex appeal but little plausibility to the part of Eduardos unstable groupie-turned-girlfriend. Action moves from the dorm rooms lecture halls and exclusive clubs of Harvard to the corporate offices of Palo Alto Calif. and d.p. Jeff Cronenweth (using the Red camera) lenses the often drab settings in dim autumnal tones. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross music often feels imperceptibly linked to ambient noises on the soundtrack; elsewhere it seems to race along as though on a current of pure electricity. Sound mix is superb especially in a key nightclub scene in which Timberlakes and Eisenbergs voices can be clearly heard over the throbbing din as young coeds dance behind them.
