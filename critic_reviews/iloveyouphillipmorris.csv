Phillip Morris Gay or straight love can drive you crazy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPhillip Morris Gay or straight love can drive you crazyI Love You Phillip Morris is a hard movie to classify and you sometimes dont know whether to laugh or gasp. Just call it a love story.The most interesting role Jim Carrey right has had in a long while.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 3 2011 I Love You Phillip Morris (out of 4) Starring Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor and Leslie Mann. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. 98 minutes. Opening March 4 at the Royal. 14A I Love You Phillip Morris is a hard movie to classify and you sometimes dont know whether to laugh or gasp. Thats probably why its been in limbo since its Sundance 2009 debut despite starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. The easiest thing is just to call it a love story. This isnt one of those polite films where the sex is in the shadows. Both straight and gay lovemaking is right out there in the open. Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa it goes to extremes both with comedy and drama as we see in the opening frame. Carreys character Steven Russell who is also the films dubious narrator lies in a hospital bed perilously close to death. He tells us that love did this to him and were about to find out why. Shift to flashback and Russell is the picture of the stereotypical American family man. Hes a Texas police officer and regular churchgoer devoted to his wife (Leslie Mann) and their two children. Russell has secrets which cant be revealed here. One of them may seem obvious since we know going in that he ends up in some kind of relationship with the titular Phillip Morris played by McGregor with restraint and mystery. But its more complicated than that. Suffice to say that Russell is going through a rite of passage and Morris becomes central to his journey which involves numerous escapes of all kinds. This is the most interesting role Carrey has had in a long while.

Newmarket Films Ewan McGregor (left) and Jim Carrey in ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" (Newmarket Films) Newmarket Films Jim Carrey in ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" (Newmarket Films) Despite its title this movie has nothing to do with cigarettes. But its star as he once famously said on screen is absolutely smokin.""Jim Carrey is the narrator heart and soul of ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" transforming what could have been a cliched con man comedy generic Jim Carrey-character comedy or run-of-the-mill gay coming-out comedy into something smarter sweeter and downright giddy. This long-shelved romp is a real Carrey showcase one that shouldnt wear the stigma ""damaged goods"" simply because it took an absurdly long time -- it was at Sundance in January 2009 -- to reach theaters.Carrey plays Steven Russell a one-time cop married man and father who lives a secret double life until that day when a bad car wreck sends him over the edge. ""Im gay"" he babbles on the EMTs gurney. ""Gay gay gay gay gay gay gay.""But out of the closet Steven gleefully cruises Miami. The con man in him comes to the fore when he makes one unpleasant discovery about his new free-wheeling lifestyle. ""Bein gay is expensive"" he drawls. Steven weasels his way into work in Texas where he shows his gift for living a lie -- many lies. But its when he gets caught and sent to prison that he truly thrives and meets his dreamboat Phillip Morris played with a drawling delicacy by Ewan McGregor.The bulk of the story concerns Stevens efforts to be close to Phillip to (once theyre out of jail) provide an opulent life for Phillip and stay one step ahead of those who might find him out in his various hustled jobs.Its a tribute to McGregor that his trademark sparkle makes us believe that a nut like Steven would fall for him and go to the ends of the Earth to earn and keep his love. And it is Carrey turning his patented shtick loose on a role with heart substance and entertainment value who makes this romantic farce a movie too good to sit on any studios shelf.

Comments (4) click to enlarge I Love You Phillip Morris Video Rated R  98 minutes  2010 Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote the black-comedy favorite Bad Santa (2003) make their directing debut with the incredible true story of Steven Jay Russell a former cop and devout Christian who turned to fraud passed himself off as a high-level financial officer and from 1992 to 1998 escaped from four different correctional facilities in the southeast so that he could tend to his passionate romances with men on the outside. As portrayed in the nonfiction book of the same name by former Houston Press reporter Steve McVicker Russell was a fascinating character and a real puzzle box but the filmmakers have turned his life into a broad farce with one wocka-wocka gag after another. As comedy writers they understand that the key to any joke is simplification but theres nothing simple about the mind of a con man and in the process of converting his narrative into a laugh machine they emphatically reduce him to his sexual orientation.

"I Love You Phillip Morris (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review I Love You Phillip Morris (R) Fact-based story defies belief but lacks a little tenderness Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald12/23/2010 Editor rating 2.5 ""Im going to be a fag"" Steven Russell (Jim Carrey) yells at the paramedics tending to him after a car crash near the start of I Love You Phillip Morris the likable but uneven comedy by writer-directors Glenn Ficara and John Requa (Bad Santa). Before that moment Steven was leading a perfectly normal life happily married to Debbie (Leslie Mann) a well-liked police officer and a devout churchgoer with lots of friends. But then two things happen First Steven tracks down his birth mother and discovers he was the middle child of her three kids - but the only one put up for adoption. Then comes the crash which almost kills him but also brings him an epiphany Instead of continuing to lead a covert double life hes going to shed his heterosexual disguise and go the full gay. So he moves to South Beach gets himself a splashy pad and finds a handsome Latino boyfriend (Rodrigo Santoro). Soon though comes a realization ""Being gay is really expensive."" And so begins Stevens amazing career of crime which includes every sort of fraud imaginable until the cops finally catch up with him and send him to prison. I Love You Phillip Morris which would be wholly unbelievable if it wasnt a true story gets a kickstart when Steven meets fellow inmate Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) a kind and gentle spirit serving a short sentence for failing to return a rental car. The two fall in love almost immediately and when Phillip is shipped to another prison Steven begins an elaborate machination for them to reunite. Even after theyre both free men though the con games and shady business deals continue Once Steven has gotten a taste of the good life hes unwilling to let it go and the mostly oblivious Phillip happily complies not fully aware of his partners criminal antics. A big part of the fun in I Love You Phillip Morris is watching these two giant movie stars plunge headlong into roles that would normally be played by lesser-known actors in a low-budget independent film. Carrey portrays Stevens outsized personality and frantic energy honestly without a trace of clownishness and McGregors turn as the sweet and trusting Phillip makes you understand how the man could have been duped so easily. The film doesnt shy away from the physicality of their relationship either Carrey and McGregor see their roles all the way through. The problem with I Love You Phillip Morris is that Stevens crimes eventually take over the movie His elaborate cons may be fascinating daring stuff but the heart of the picture is the romantic relationship which is squeezed out to the edges. McGregor doesnt get enough screen time to fully flesh out Phillip - there has to be more to the man than just his innocence - and the humor gradually seeps out of the film as Stevens legal woes become graver and his stunts more outrageous. By films end I Love You Phillip Morris feels more like the seriocomic study of a hucksters astonishing career than a romance interrupted by a man who wanted all or nothing - and thought himself invincible.

Russell meets Phillip Morris in prison.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 17 2010Nothing to do with the tobacco industry and everything to do with obsession and ardor I Love You Phillip Morris begins with the familiar pretitle memo that the following is based on a true story. Or to quote more accurately ""This really happened. . . . It really did.""And certainly as this increasingly outrageous tale unfolds the old saw that truth is stranger than fiction becomes a slogan to be mounted on a billboard limned in neon all caps in 3-D.Written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa the wordsmiths behind the gleefully dark Bad Santa I Love You Phillip Morris stars Jim Carrey as Steven Russell a gentleman and a scholar (his IQ has been clocked at 163) now serving a 144-year sentence in a Texas prison.But as Ficarra and Requas film begins Russell is a Virginia Beach cop married (to the always game giggly Leslie Mann) a seemingly affable regular guy. Except that Steven has been living a secret life - hes gay.And then one day separated from the missus and doing time for credit card fraud or identity theft or some other illegal skill he meets the mild-mannered Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) and cartoon songbirds go off in his head. Its love at first sight and it becomes Stevens mission to arrange their exit from jail and live happily ever after.And for quite a time and with quite a few phony identities and resumA(c)s this they do. (At one point Steven is hired as chief financial officer of a medical insurance company where he proceeds to embezzle huge sums.)Carrey an actor not known for his restraint literally beams as Russell who earned the sobriquet ""King Con"" and who is now the subject of a petition campaign to reduce his daunting prison term. Yes some familiar Carrey tactics are on display but the stars performance has real heart - its easily the best thing he has done since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.And McGregor playing his lover is a perfect foil gentle funny magnetic. Ultimately Phillip becomes exasperated by Stevens epic deceptions. But not before hes been sent to prison and escaped from prison several times over.A gay love story thats handled straight (no pun intended) I Love You Phillip Morris has had a difficult time getting to theaters. It screened at Sundance in January 2009 and its taken this long (just shy of two years) to find its way to screens. Its a safe bet that the wariness on the part of distributors was not due to the films glorification of criminal behavior.What it does glorify however is mad love mad money and an almost mad zeal to run free.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When a film opens with a title announcing ""This really happened"" then adds after a beat ""It really did"" you know youre in for some kind of a rollercoaster ride. ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" based on events that trump anything you could dream up outside of a peyote ritual is a delirious comedy that remains on track largely thanks to Jim Carreys goofy but grounded performance. As Stephen Russell a gay Houdini who broke out of Texas prisons repeatedly to be with his beloved ex-cellmate Carrey pushes the comedy to the limits without camping up his character. Its ""Brokeback Mountain"" starring the Three Stooges. In the films opening Stephen narrates from a hospital bed as his vital signs drop. ""Love sure is a funny thing"" he muses recalling days when he lived a serenely sanitized bogus life. He was married (to the cheerfully oblivious Leslie Mann) with a couple of kids played the organ at his hand-clapping church and pounded the beat as a cop. After a crisis jarringly reminds him you only go around once Stephen rockets out of the closet ready to make up for lost time. He arrives in Miami determined to live in Liberace-level opulence. And if paying for it means staying afloat through phony insurance claims and credit-card scams well a fellas got to live right? Stephen is eventually nabbed and fellow convict Phillip played by Ewan McGregor as an eyelash-batting Southern coquette falls for him in a matter of minutes. Stephens so glib and self-assured that he hardly seems to be a prisoner; the library where they meet could be his office. Stephen a master of bribery courts his bunkmate with first-class chow and boombox oldies. When a night screamer frazzles Phillips nerves Stephen hires an inmate to thrash him into silence. Phillip mists up declaring ""That is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me."" In some of their scenes together Carrey tamps down his ebullient mania and does a fair impression of a fraud unexpectedly touched by true love. Time and again he engineers wild schemes to reunite with his man. In the end its his misguided attempts to live like royalty that strain the relationship; Phillip just wants to settle down into the kind of suburban routine that Stephen disdains. Carrey and writer/directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa keep us largely on his side. Hes pathological but his capers deliver a comedy-of-errors kick. Fans of ""Liar Liar"" will appreciate the scenes where he impersonates a lawyer and lies his way into a job as a corporate financial officer. Hes a crook but his narration half-convinces us that the people he embezzles from have it coming. They are soooo boring. I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content including strong dialogue and language. Where Uptown. As they did in their script for 2003s ""Bad Santa"" Ficarra and Requa make a jaunty case for antisocial behavior. The story itself is a cleverly designed con job that echoes Stephens swindles.

The physical humor the exaggerated mugging the wild shifts from comedy to bathos -- throw a nose on him and put him in the circus. If you dare compare him to Charlie Chaplin the greatest saddest clown in 115 years of cinema a master of laughs and sniffles. But Chaplin directed himself. He wrote for himself. He knew exactly what material best exploited his genius and Carrey - I say this as a fan - does not. He needs a script that reconciles the comedy with the tragedy the eccentricity with the pain and he needs a director who treats both with utmost seriousness. He found that someone in Milos Forman Peter Weir and Michel Gondry. The same cant be said for Glenn Ficarra and John Requa writer-directors of I Love You Phillip Morris a tonally schizoid fitfully entertaining film about a pathologically two-faced man. Based on the book by former Houston Press and Chronicle reporter Steve McVicker its an odd duck by design a loopy romantic tragedy inspired by actual Texas con man Steven Jay Russell (Carrey) his prison-inmate inamorato Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) and his many bizarro escapades committed in the name of love. To buy into this we need to accept Steven as both charlatan and idealist - as a world-class bamboozler who falls truly desperately in love. We also need to accept a plot that jerks us around like a con artist manipulating and obfuscating because it can. Carrey does virtuosic work here - he oozes tenderness and all-out bluster often in the same scene - but hes undone by erratic direction and sudden lurches in pacing and mood. Because we cant get a fix on the narrative intent (Should we be laughing? Blubbering? Both maybe?) we cant get a fix on Steven either. And its hard to care what happens to him. ""Love sure is a funny thing"" he says in narration at the start under a nice morbid glimpse of his flatlining body on a hospital bed. From there the film hops back to his early days in Virginia and Texas as a married father of two an existence interrupted by periodic sex with men (""Oh did I forget? Im gay - gay gay gay gay gay""). Then it skips forward to a period of out-and-proud glamness in Florida. Which he finds is expensive. Which leads him to fraud. Which lands him in a Texas jail where he meets the all-important Phillip whose sweetie-pie innocence totally slays him. The romance between them is touching at its best moments corny at its worst. ""But ... we only just met"" says a breathy Phillip batting his eyelashes like a practiced coquette. McGregor is a smart man and a sly actor If his performance plays like an ironic gay tweak on Southern belle stereotypes then it probably is. But it rings false as does a transcendently awful flashback (starring the ever-so-sleek Rodrigo Santoro) that seems nicked from General Hospital and sets up the films bogus emotional crescendo. Like everything else in I Love You Phillip Morris it turns out to be a scam. The romance between them is touching at its best moments corny at its worst.

It seems a gay prison romantic con-man comedy starring Jim Carrey is a hard sell especially when the title makes you think of a tobacco empire. Now its here (courtesy of Roadside Attractions) and its funny. Working from the nonfiction book by Houston journalist Steve McVicker writers-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa apply generous helpings of the mischief they brought to their script for Bad Santa. That means very few sacred cows and not much shying away from a wild and woolly story or from its heros sexuality. ""Did I mention I was gay?"" asks Carreys gleefully unreliable narrator Steven Russell in an early voice-over and the accompanying image now known as ""the Jim Carrey gay sex scene"" adds a thousand more words.Hes also a relentless white-collar con man a Texas hustler with the gift of gab and a talent for slipping out of prison (displayed in a long crafty escape montage). An early incarceration brings him to Phillip (Ewan McGregor) in the can for rental-car fraud; the new acquaintances enter romantic euphoria as they tumble for each other in a hurry.Part bawdy prison yarn part criminal character study I Love You Phillip Morris is also an earnest love story between two men. That combination treated with the brazen comic strokes you might find in a mainstream Judd Apatow or Farrelly Brothers romp qualifies as groundbreaking in a movie industry that doesnt take as many chances as it likes to think.Carrey seems more comfortable here than usual. He keeps the manic shtick to a minimum but retains his timing and doesnt betray any self-consciousness. When Russell drawls through a breakdown of the prison currency system (which includes goods other than cash and cigarettes) to a new inmate he delivers variations on the same laugh line with a poker face and even delivery. His Russell is both an incorrigible romantic and a compulsive liar and Phillip Morris grows richer as it ties these strands together.It also suffers the occasional bout of atonality especially in the midst of Russells final royal scam. Yes romantic comedies are supposed to carry some peril and all movie romances need to navigate a crisis or two to earn their emotional stakes. Its just that Russells rackets can take awhile to reveal themselves which can leave the audience stumbling for solid ground along with the secondary characters.Ultimately thats part of the gag as were reminded every time Carreys voice-over doubles back to reveal Russells schemes. (Its a more tepid take on the loopy but tone-perfect narration voiced by Matt Damon in Steven Soderberghs con-man caper The Informant). I Love You Phillip Morris doesnt jockey for sympathy for its subject and it doesnt push Russells love into pulling our heartstrings. It finds the humor in an unlikely love story and it resists any temptation to play it straight.Follow movie critic Chris Vognar on Twitter chris vognar.Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John RequaStarring Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor Leslie Mann Antoni Corone and Michael MandelRun time 100 minutesMPAA rating R (sexual content including strong dialogue and language) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

I Love You Phillip Morris Directors Glenn Ficarra John Requa. Cast Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor Leslie Mann. Rating R for sexual content including strong dialogue and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. Spotlight Jim Carrey | Ewan McGregor Prison movies | SHOWTIMES This almost never happens of course and not just because movie trailers these days seem to give away 90 percent of the story for free. Who goes to a movie youve never heard of? But every once in a while you end up in a theater playing something that sounds like a documentary expose on the tobacco industry but is actually a daring dramedy starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor in a dysfunctional gay romance that blooms behind prison bars. And now of course you know too much about ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" to get the full impact of its narrative twists and turns. Based on the true story of con man Steven Jay Russell the film is constructed as a series of revelations that surely lose will their ability to surprise if you Google that name. Not that this is a perfect movie even when shown off to best advantage. Carreys voiceover narration may speed along the exposition but often it is intrusive and unnecessary. And since his character is a narcissistic liar it can be tough to care about the relationship playing out on-screen even though the performances are powerful in their honesty and vulnerability. Aside from the voiceover Carrey is truly great in one of those rare risky roles that prove he can do more than pull faces although the frank portrayal of an alpha male who is also ""gay gay gay gay gay"" is sure to make some percentage of his fan base squirm. McGregor whom we are more used to seeing disappear into a role is also excellent as a decidedly non-alpha male. Some of his little character-study bits are just perfect - but again probably spoiled by description. If youre a fan of provocative offbeat films such as ""My Own Private Idaho"" or ""The Crying Game"" you might want to give ""Phillip Morris"" a chance.

"I Love You Phillip Morris | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-love-you-phillip-morris ) I Love You Phillip Morris (France/United States 2010) December 09 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli I Love You Phillip Morris begins by telling us that its based on a true story. Then as if we might be disbelieving of that claim it reinforces it. Truth as they say is stranger than fiction. (Not really but the phrase sounds good so we use it.) At times I Love You Phillip Morris verges on genius. On other occasions it falls into a rut and has trouble getting back on the blacktop. As a comedy it crackles with deadpan wit and dark satire. As a romance it lacks vigor. And on those occasions when it ventures into dramatic territory it is rarely effective. Ultimately the plot (irrespective of how faithful it is to real life) isnt the problem - its the unevenness with which co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (both making their directorial debuts) approach it that limits the films success and mutes the experience of sitting through it. Jim Carrey was born to play Steven Russell the con man protagonist with the rubber face and the oversized smile. Its as if the role was tailored for him and he has no trouble with the slightly exaggerated approach demanded by the comedic elements. Ewan McGregor however is less impressive. The part of Phillip Morris a sweet guy with a Southern accent demands a deft approach that eludes McGregor who mistakes ""one-note"" for ""low-key."" Hes too earnest and as a result of the mismatch in style and energy level theres too little chemistry for the romance to work as more than a plot necessity. The devaluation of the love story limits the effectiveness of the few genuinely dramatic moments leaving the comedy as the lone standout aspect of I Love You Phillip Morris. The movie begins with Steven Russell (Jim Carrey) apparently on his deathbed. His story to that point is related via flashbacks with Steven providing a tongue-in-cheek voiceover narrative. He spends his early adult life assimilating into suburbia playing the role of the perfect husband to Debbie (Leslie Mann) and pursuing a career as a small-town cop. A car accident forces Steven to re-assess his life and he elects to make changes. He admits to being gay leaves Debbie and moves in with his new boyfriend Jimmy (Rodrigo Santoro) and starts spending huge amounts of money to fund the ""gay lifestyle."" Since Steven doesnt have the money he chooses to obtain it in the most expedient form possible by becoming a con man. Eventually this lifestyle catches up to him and he ends up in jail. There he meets Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) who becomes the love of his life. Once out of prison however Steven cant resist the allure of his old ways but this time his schemes become more audacious... and lucrative. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of I Love You Phillip Morris is its inability to maintain the high level at which it begins - a withering lampoon of wholesome middle class values. At some point the movie decides it wants us to take its characters seriously and become invested in their relationship and thats when I Love You Phillip Morris loses a share of its sense of fun. Even with Carreys fine performance on display in nearly every scene the movie cant help spinning its wheels. At times theres a twisted resemblance to Steven Spielbergs Catch Me if You Can. Steven is as slippery as an eel but every time he gives the authorities the slip he never quite gets away. Some of the means by which he facilitates his escape are so complex that its a shame they net him only a short span of liberty. Its as if Steven invests all his creative energy into planning the getaway but doesnt think much about what happens after he succeeds. On more than one occasion Carreys performance dwarfs the material benefitting from his work; it will be interesting to see if the buzz is sufficient to warrant an Oscar nomination. The romance is a persistent flaw - not because it shows two men in love but because their relationship feels artificial. We recognize that Steven and Phillip are in love because its a plot point. Were told it. But we dont feel it and that emotional component - or its absence - is what prevents I Love You Phillip Morris from becoming all it aspires to be. Its an entertaining diversion that contains unrealized elements of something better.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Sometimes you watch Jim Carrey blow a gasket and wonder how much more interesting his throwaway movies would be if they better served him. What if the directors took the farce seriously? What if Carreys mania were let loose in the real world to hurt and bewilder? What if his powers of comic seduction had a limit on the people around him? ""I Love You Phillip Morris  gets close to an answer. He does the same mugging and gymnastics as in ""Liar Liar  (Carreys physical peak) and ""Yes Man the romantic comedy he phoned in two winters ago. This new movie adds a psychology to the Southern conman hes playing. The mugging has a point. The grin he wears in just about every scene here is a mask.The movies first words are ""This really happened. It really did. Its the sort of disclaimer that begs you to accept cliches as a fact of life. This one smacks of envy. Adapting Steve McVickers book about Steven Russell who remains in a maximum-security prison the writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa seem to wish theyd invented him themselves. Everything about Steven is a sham. As a boy his parents tell him that his mother gave him up for adoption for no apparent reason -- he was the middle child. He had a baby with a devout Christian (Leslie Mann) but has been gay for as long he can remember. Coming out to her is the only time he appears to have come clean about anything.The movie whizzes through the details. It shares some of Carreys mania. Steven moves from Texas to Miami wears a lot of bad Versace and falls in love. ""Being gay is really expensive he says by way of explaining how he happens into a career of scams -- slips falls fraud. But hes too good at it for it to be a purely desperate vocation. He winds up in a Texas prison nonetheless and is drawn to Phillip a mild-mannered openly gay blond whom Ewan McGregor plays with a smart blend of passion naivety and self-pity. Poor Phillip brings out the best in Steven which is to say he brings out the worst. He scams his way into the facility to which Phillip has been transferred.After Steven is released he scams Phillip out of prison. They move in together. He tells Phillip hes a lawyer when hes never even been to college and winds up defending a friend of Phillip in court. This sequence is a mini-marvel of old-Hollywood confusion. Opposing counsel knows Steven has no case. So eventually does his client whose face falls after she sees his empty briefcase. The judge is on the fence. And the filmmakers dont let Carrey seem too competent. He looks cornered. But some well-strategized silences and one bald accusation result in the kind of awk ward comedy youd find in an Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturges film.The last 20 minutes veer into a darker more fascinating comedy sustained by a montage of prison breaks and culminating in a crowning lie that makes Steven a moral opportunist on top of everything else. (""This really happened. It really did.) This isnt great farce but its more than good enough. And Carrey is more than good enough in it. Ficarra and Requa give his filthier instincts room to thrive. This is the first Carrey comedy since the Farrelly brothers ""Dumb and Dumber not to fear vulgarity.What research did Carrey do for this part? He doesnt appear ever to have met a gay queen -- or the queens he met werent inspiring enough. Instead hes playing something completely different the sort of pathological risk addiction that also brought us ""Catch Me If You Can. The performance often errs on the side of cartoon but its laced with flashes of remorse and chagrin with sincerity. When Carrey tries to do ""dramatic acting the life always goes of out him. Here the drama is all in that grin. He doesnt look like hes having the time of his life outsmarting the world. He looks miserable. This is a man whos tragically incapable of being saved from himself a homosexual who couldnt be legally or ethically straight either.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

By Anthony Lane Christian Bale Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams in David O. Russells movie.   Credit Illustration by ROBERT RISKO Is David O. Russells ""The Fighter"" really a boxing movie? It certainly reeks of the ring and the plotline culled from life follows the ascent of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) a welterweight from Lowell Massachusetts who became a world champion in 2000 and remains a hero to his people today. Split the movie into a dozen rounds though and only about three of them would be adjudged boxing-based. What powers ""The Fighter"" is not glory with gloves on but the rough bare-knuckled rapport that Ward maintains with his mother and his siblings. This is in the fullest and sweatiest sense family entertainment. The resident matriarch is Alice (Melissa Leo) herself as hard as a heavyweight. Even her hair is hard brushed up and styled to the point of immobility. You might think her poor husband merely henpecked until you watch her sling pots and pans at him across the kitchen for daring to question her judgment. Some pecking. Some hen. Alice has borne a formidable brood including a squadron of Celtic daughters--seven of them sometimes all shouting abuse at once. I used to think the witches in ""Macbeth"" were a scary bunch but Alices girls make them look like the Andrews Sisters. As for Micky he is the cynosure of his mothers eye. ""All we ever wanted for you was to be world champion"" she tells him. No pressure there then. Micky is trained by his half brother Dicky (Christian Bale) a former boxer. He once had Sugar Ray Leonard on the floor he says--and goes on saying to anyone who will listen though rumor has it that Leonard slipped. But most people no longer listen to Dicky. Halfway between skeleton and ghost he lives in a crack house. Bale is the first thing we see in the film. Gaunt as a saint preparing for martyrdom his eyes gazing without a blink from sunken sockets he jabbers and grins; there is a film crew within the film making a documentary for HBO and hes hopped up by the presence of the camera. (It takes us a while to realize that Micky tacit and modest is sitting right next to him.) The starlight lingers even when Dicky having impersonated a police officer and then assaulted a real one goes to jail and shivers through cold turkey. When his program finally airs he parades through his fellow-cons enrobed in their applause and takes his seat in front of the TV like a god before his own altar. All of this creates a dazzling portrait of delusion and one hell of a cautionary tale for any viewers planning to curdle their brains with drugs but theres a hitch so thoroughly does Bale embrace the part that the dazzle threatens to outblaze the drama. You dont find yourself thinking What a wild and wasted soul that Dicky is. You think Wow look at Christian Bale playing a wild and wasted soul. What an ace job hes doing. So much acting. Theres a hint but only a hint of the same thing in Amy Adams in the role of Mickys girlfriend Charlene. As she bends over in denim hot pants at the bar where she works to reveal a tattoo at the base of her spine we realize that Charlene represents a radical departure for Adams who may well be starting to tire of all the nuns cooks princesses and other assorted honeys she normally gets to play. There is nothing honeyed about Charlene; against stiff competition she has the dirtiest mouth in the movie though her task is a virtuous one--to pull Micky from the wreckage of his kin as if from a burning plane. ""Everybody said I could beat him"" Micky tells her after a disastrous cheek-splitting bout with a fighter almost twenty pounds heavier. ""Whos everybody?"" Charlene asks. ""My mother and my brother"" Micky says. As for what the mother makes of that brother we are asked to believe that Alice doesnt truly understand Dickys crack habit until she sees it aired or smoked out on HBO. Yeah right. Not even Melissa Leo fierce and flinty actress that she is can pull that one off. For all the bluster ""The Fighter"" jostles dangerously close to the corny. Maybe thats an occupational hazard of the boxing movie which traditionally balances the physical prospect of beating someone out of his senses with the more edifying notion of having good sense beaten back in. Hence the ""Rocky"" franchise and hence the conventional climax of ""The Fighter"" with Micky confronting an Irishman named Shae Neary (Anthony Molinari) who appears to be hewn from basalt. We could be watching a Ron Howard picture. In short its a curious project for David O. Russell the maker of ""I Heart Huckabees"" (2004) and the jitters in mood here from melodrama to semi-farce and from blue-collar grit to teary triumphalism suggest a director striving to keep control of bumpy material. When Russell broke through with ""Three Kings"" (1999) the result was no less multilayered but it was a found complexity you felt inherent in the messiness of war to which Russell was calmly doing justice. There is a Micky Ward story ironically that might have suited Russell better. Not the one that closed with Neary in 2000 but the one that began two years later with the first of Wards three matches against Arturo Gatti--a three-act drama if ever there was one starring two guys who when they werent trying to annihilate each other became loyal friends. To some aficionados the first was the fight of the century so far. Even in the mini-ring of YouTube itll knock you flat whereas ""The Fighter"" for all the dedication of its players takes a heavy swing at us and misses. Despite the title ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is not a bravely unfashionable hymn of praise to the tobacco industry. What it offers more implausible still is a chance to see Jim Carrey make out with Ewan McGregor. The chance arises when Steven Russell (Carrey) goes to jail for fraud and falls at first gasp for the Phillip of the title (McGregor) a gentle ginger-blond with an accent quivering somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. The rest of the film is absorbed less by the pursuit of love--for Phillip returns Stevens affections forthwith--than by the headlong pursuit of everything that will make the love run sweetly. Here you might say is a genuine romance its ardor unquenched by distance confinement and death. On the other hand in the touching words of Phillip ""Enough romance. Lets fuck."" In some ways we are not that far from ""The Fighter."" Both movies present a prison term less as an ordeal than as something manageable redemptive and useful. Both are also based on fact; according to the final credits of ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" the true Steven Russell currently resides in a Texas penitentiary--on twenty-three-hour lockdown if you can believe it. The moral of the film however is that you cant believe anything at all not with Steven around. Mendacity is his proper state. Not content with a sheaf of dodgy credit cards he pretends to be the chief financial officer of a major company and thinks nothing of adopting the weighty tones of a judge on the phone to get himself bailed. This brand of shape-shifting is as easy as pie for Carrey and I like the idea of all that elasticated verve and boundless good will being turned to nefarious ends. So why has the movie languished on remand awaiting release since January 2009 when it screened at Sundance? Dont Carrey addicts merit quicker service? Well aside from those who may be mildly discomfited by watching their hero whoop and holler like a rodeo rider as he gets it on with a gentleman described in the credits as ""The Moustached Man"" many will find the films geniality wearing thin and false. You could argue that falsity is Stevens stock-in-trade but there is a further more unpleasant falsity in the guttering emotional tone. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa the writers of ""Bad Santa"" (2003) wrote and directed this movie and once again they proceed on the assumption that taste is no more than a silly shackle to be snapped and tossed away. Is it that funny though to be shown how to fake your own death from AIDS? And how does such deceit affect the flashback in which Steven professes love to an earlier partner who is dying of the same disease? Are all tears meant to be crocodile? Steven tries to catch us out at regular intervals with a shot of unreliable narration (""Oh did I forget to mention Im gay?"" or ""Theres something I didnt tell you"") but the filmmakers attempt to enshrine him as an enigma unknowable and arcane is defeated by our dawning realization that he is unmistakably a jerk. At best ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" may be hailed as a necessary step in Hollywoods fearful crawl toward sexual evenhandedness; the film upholds the constitutional right of every gay man to be as much of a liar a crook and a creep as the rest of us.

"I Love You Phillip Morris is irresistibly self-assured in its weirdness. Slate Sign In Sign Up I Love You Phillip Morris is irresistibly self-assured in its weirdness. I Love You Phillip Morris is irresistibly self-assured in its weirdness. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 6 2010 1228 PM I Love You Phillip Morris This ""gay"" movieis irresistibly self-assured in its weirdness. By Dana Stevens Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor in I Love You Phillip Morris. Now heres an unlikely premise for a Hollywood movie Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor meet in prison and fall madly in love. After theyre released from jail (through a series of subterfuges too elaborate to detail here) the pair cut a swath through the American South as a team of horny opportunistic unrepentant con artists. The only thing more unlikely than such a movie getting made in the first place is the idea that it would find distribution and I Love You Phillip Morris (Roadside Attractions) almost didnt--it sat on a shelf while distributors puzzled over how to mass market a gay romance so blithely unconcerned with earnest uplift. Phillip Morris isnt a perfect movie by any means but its irresistibly self-assured in its weirdness. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The directorial debut of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (the comedy-writing team responsible for Bad Santa) I Love You Phillip Morris is based on the true story of Steven Russell. As the movie begins Steven (played by Jim Carrey) is a churchgoing cop in Texas married to a nice Christian woman (played delightfully by Leslie Mann who deserves a movie of her own already). When hes nearly killed in an auto accident Steven abruptly decides to stop living a lie ""Im a faggot"" he yells exultantly to the EMS workers as they carry him to the ambulance. Advertisement But after leaving his wife and children to hook up with a boyfriend in Key West Steven realizes to his consternation that ""Being gay is really expensive."" So he embarks on a series of freelance swindles eventually landing in prison for insurance fraud. When he meets the gentle Philip (Ewan McGregor) in the prison library its love at first sight and Steven employs his preternatural gift for deception to get the two of them assigned as cellmates and eventually to spring his boyfriend from jail. Jim Carrey has struggled in midlife to find a place for his outsized dominating performance style sometimes tamping it down for straight dramatic roles like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind sometimes hiding behind animated avatars as a voice actor in A Christmas Carol and Horton Hears a Who. Carreys performance here is broad clownlike and in the sex scenes especially almost deliberately grotesque. Yet hes also vulnerable and tender. Ewan McGregor brings a screwball sweetness to his role as the blond Southern nancy boy whos both bedazzled and shocked by his boyfriends criminal audacity. Though the movie is light on story with an episodic structure that sometimes drags I Love You Phillip Morris is something close to brilliant in its mastery of tone. Like Bad Santa its a black comedy with a caramel center. The movie goes to some really bleak places--I cant tell you how bleak without spoiling a major twist--and shows its characters in some very unflattering lights without ever abandoning its basic faith in the redemptive power of love. What saves that faith from being cloying is how the Steven/Phillip romance comes mixed with a heaping helping of sex--when he looks for shapes in the clouds Steven cant help but spot a proudly erect phallus every time. In the end I Love You Phillip Morris is neither a light romantic comedy nor a pious drama of oppression. Its a passionate amoral caper a story of outlaw love on the run in the tradition of Breathless or True Romance. Without making any big proclamations I Love You Phillip Morris neatly subverts our every expectation of what a ""gay movie"" should be. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 3 2010 Save for later Saved Jim Carrey is shown in a scene from I Love You Phillip Morris. Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Jim Carrey began his career by making the whole world laugh and then like most comics he decided he wanted to be more than just a beloved buffoon. Hes taken real chances in his choice of roles and although most of them havent paid off either commercially (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") or artistically (""The Majestic"") he deserves credit for not merely pushing the envelope but puncturing it.All this is by way of saying that ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is a movie that may flummox even fans of ""The Cable Guy.""As yet another in a seemingly endless series of based-on-a-true-story movies ""Phillip Morris"" becomes increasingly unbelievable the longer it plays out. Carrey plays Steven Russell who finds out as a boy that hes been adopted grows up to be a Georgia policeman has two kids and a lovely wife (Leslie Mann) sings in church and all the while it turns out is gay. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Following his rejection by the birth mother hes tracked down Steven decides to ditch his own family and triumphantly live his life as a gay man. Living la vida loca in South Beach he discovers that ""being gay is really expensive"" and goes on a spree of financial fraudulence that eventually lands him in prison where he hooks up with blond cellmate Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor doing his best to alienate his ""Star Wars"" fans). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? These two are googly-eyed soul mates which doesnt prevent Steven from capsizing their relationship such as it is at every opportunity. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who co-wrote and directed were responsible for the very funny ""Bad Santa"" which was attacked for attacking the Santa Claus myth. (Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus and he was played by Billy Bob Thornton.) In ""Phillip Morris"" their trademark off-center black comedy too often misses the mark.The movie at its best is compellingly odd which is also the most accurate description of Carreys performance. Just as the filmmakers slip in and out of boffo laughs (broad prison humor) and tragedy (AIDS) Carrey with his rubbery gyrations and split-second facial changeovers can turn his performance around on a dime. Hes the perfect actor for this piece which for better and worse resembles a cross between ""The Green Mile"" and ""Catch Me If You Can.""

Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions I Love You Phillip Morris Director John Requa Glenn Ficarra Genre Comedy/Drama/Romance Running Time 98 minutes Rated R for sexual content including strong dialogue and language. With Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor Leslie Mann Rodrigo Santoro Michael Mandel (Recommended) The con-man comedy I Love You Phillip Morris premiered almost two years ago at the Sundance Film Festival garnering lots of talk admiring reviews and laughs aplenty. It has since played around the world from London to Hong Kong even becoming a surprise smash in Latvia. Only now however is it opening in the U.S. The reasons for the delay -- rival distributors lawsuits and so on -- arent as intriguing as the true story that inspired the film. Ill brush that in below (for more details check out Pat Dowells prison interview) but lets start with the improbable-but-true story of the unreliable narrator at the center of it all. His names Steven Russell and he lived what you might call a storied life. For a while he was a stand-up guy a policeman a church organist by all accounts a good father and by his wifes account a great husband. He was also a scam artist and con man who led police on a merry -- no make that a gay -- chase for quite a few years. See marriage and kids notwithstanding Steven played in the film by an antic Jim Carrey was living life on the down-low. (But in high style which proved expensive.) When he started scamming insurance companies employers and pretty much anyone else who came his way he ended up in prison.

Sweeping Phillip into his confidence and off his feet Steven thereafter did most of his cons in order to keep the two of them together. Liar Liar meets Obi-Wan? Whoda thunk even fearless star power could make these two work as a romantic pair? But both stars prove to be enormous fun in a gay love story played straight in a thoroughly crooked context --a comic crooked context mind you with lots of physical comedy because thats what Jim Carrey does and a surprising amount of actual feeling because thats also what Jim Carrey does though hes not often given credit for it. The result? A love-struck Catch Me If You Can in which Steven cons his way out of prison cons Phillips way out of prison and even cons Phillip when he can occasionally coming home with dollar bills spilling out of every pocket as if its the most natural thing in the world. i Beyond the prison gates Phillip Morris (McGregor) tries to live peacefully despite Stevens continued scams. Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions Beyond the prison gates Phillip Morris (McGregor) tries to live peacefully despite Stevens continued scams. Patti Perret/Roadside Attractions Youd think all of this would be lent a certain gravitas by the fact that the off-screen Steven Russell is a real con sitting in a real Texas prison. Having escaped four times he has now embarrassed state authorities so much that they keep him on 23-hour lockdown for fear that if they allow him to mingle with the general prison population hell escape again. One time he even managed to convince them hed died. But writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa -- the guys who wrote Bad Santa -- are hardly the sort of filmmakers whod approach this story as a biopic. They cut seriousness with laughs at every plot twist; theyre frank about sexuality without ever making gayness a punchline. They allow their stars to shine without pushing them to go over-the-top. And they end up with a hilariously unlikely but entirely believable comic love story -- even as they pull a couple of ingeniously outrageous cons on the audience.

Jim Carrey plays a gay con man in ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" his first bio-pic since he portrayed Andy Kaufman in the underrated ""Man in the Moon"" (1999) and his most out-there performance since ""The Cable Guy"" (1996) -- two of the biggest flops of his career. While I cant imagine the darkly hilarious comedy ""Phillip Morris"" will do much better -- the considerable gay sexual content will challenge Carreys fanboy base not to mention audiences used to his family-friendly fare -- its a welcome alternative to the homogenized Hollywood releases that proliferate during the holiday season. ""This really happened"" says an opening credit anticipating incredulity at the unbelievable story that follows. ""It really did."" Carrey gives his best performance since ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004) as Steven Russell a religiously devout Georgia policeman and father of two (Leslie Mann plays his understanding wife) who comes flaming out of the closet after a near-death experience -- the first it turns out of several. The newly flamboyant Steven moves to Florida where he acquires a hunky boyfriend (Rodrigo Santoro) and posing as an accountant starts robbing his employer blind to support his extravagant lifestyle. Arrested for an earlier embezzlement Steven is extradited and imprisoned in Texas where he falls head over heels for an effeminate fellow inmate named Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor in a performance even more courageous than Carreys). What follows is a series of ever-more-extreme con jobs -- Steven is particularly adept at impersonating lawyers and prison personnel -- as our hero tries to continue living with the love of his life despite the best effort of law-enforcement authorities to separate them. As written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (the screenwriters of ""Bad Santa"") its basically a live-action Warner Bros. cartoon spiced with frequent explicit gay sexual references -- with poor Steven absorbing as much physical abuse as Elmer Fudd and Wile E. Coyote combined. A truly wacky plea for tolerance of homosexuality and possibly larceny the candy-colored ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is such an endearing oddity that you have to wonder exactly for whom it was made. But Im glad they did nonetheless.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Friday December 3 2010 400 AM Title I Love You Phillip Morris A con man tries to make a life for himself and his lover. With Jim Carrey Ewan McGregor. Directors Glenn Ficarra John Requa (150). R Sexuality language. At Lincoln Square Chelsea Cinemas Village 7.Arriving some 10 months after it was due and feeling like an episode of ""Threes Company"" dressed in prison orange ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" not only blasts gay stereotypes back decades it could actually make people wish for a third Ace Ventura movie. Both of those are an accomplishment though neither is a compliment.Jim Carrey plays a closeted husband and father who gets into a car wreck decides to live as an out gay man and runs up such a tab (""Being gay is expensive"") that he instigates financial frauds to make ends meet. In covering all this Carrey tries to blend his more successful turns in serious satires (""The Truman Show"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") with his comic anarchy. But they cancel each other out and whats left is a performance that evokes in its charmless reserves of anger such fidgety Carrey freaks as Ace the Mask and the Riddler.As for gay stereotypes Though it glides in on a pretense of equality -- everyone deserves a romantic anti-establishment farce -- ""Phillip Morris"" uses a true story from the 90s as a catch-all where the only thing that stands out is an incredibly mincing performance and a nudge-nudge sense of humor.The mincing comes via Ewan McGregor who as the title love interest is Steven Russells (Carrey) soul mate. They meet in a Texas prison where each is paying for white-collar crimes; once theyre on the outside the rambunctious Steven returns to his old flim-flammery conning his way into boardrooms and corporate positions.Phillip hates that side of Steven and as much as hed like to stand by his man -- as Stevens evangelical ex-wife (Leslie Mann) does -- hes shocked to find his beloved isnt even a lawyer as he said.Except everything Steven says sounds like a put-on so the audience isnt surprised despite a third-act twist that was daring for the real-life Russell and is handled well by writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa whose screenplay for 2003s ""Bad Santa"" was a far more successful tweaking of tradition.Here they attempt to do more and they do almost all of it badly. McGregors vaudevillian turn complete with small dog and a Southern accent best described as teenage Tennessee Williams is distracting as is Carreys search for ways to accommodate his Gumby-ized flexibility. When he finds them theyre amusing but gratuitous much like the movies multiple prison escapes and excessive back-story.Carrey is clearly hungry to wear a clown suit again. Its a shame he cant just be who he is and move on. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Steven spends a lot of time in the prisons law library trying to learn his way out of his legal mess. ABOUT THE MOVIEI Love You Phillip Morris 1/2 out of four Stars Jim Carrey Ewan MacGregor Leslie MannDirectors John Requa Glenn FicarraDistributor Roadside AttractionsRating R for sexual contentincluding strong dialogue and languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday in Los Angeles New York and San Francisco By Claudia Puig USA TODAY While not a standard-issue Jim Carrey comedy I Love You Phillip Morris barrels around in manic fashion much like Carrey does in most of his movies. Hes meant to be a fool for love but mostly hes just bonkers. An oddball hybrid the movie aspires to be a dark comedy sensual romance true crime account and con-artist thriller. Its most lasting image however may be of Carrey in fishnets. Directors John Requa and Glenn Ficarra who wrote the wickedly hilarious Bad Santa assume a mocking tone that falls flat. They aspire for a cleverly offbeat vibe but it feels forced and calculated. Carrey seems as if hes playing Carrey playing the role of a gay man. In other words his portrayal comes off as insincere. We know Carrey is capable of embodying a complex character after his superb turns in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Man in the Moon. But here he plays his supposedly charismatic con man in one rather off-tune note. Though there are some funny lines the saga -- based on a true story -- comes off far-fetched growing less credible as the movie unspools. Carrey plays Steven a married father and small-town Georgia police officer whose near-fatal car accident leads to an epiphany. He decides to come out of the closet and live proudly as the gay man he knows he is. One of the best segments comes after he makes this decision. The setting switches to Florida where we see Steven jauntily walking a pair of small dogs beside his handsome boyfriend Jimmy (Rodrigo Santoro) to the strains of Latin-infused music. Hes happy perhaps for the first time knows all the hot spots and spends lavishly. ""I bought anything that caught my eye"" Carrey says in the voiceover. And though he has a good job its not enough to subsidize his lifestyle ""No one ever talks about this but being gay is really expensive."" Lacking a college education he chooses a life of crime. In short time hes behind bars. Thats where the real story begins. In prison Steven haunts the law library learning about legalities and how to skirt them. It also is where he meets the love of his life Phillip (an appealingly low-key Ewan McGregor). Prison life looks downright tame. The prisoners canary-yellow uniforms are always pressed and spotless and prison riots look like playground scuffles. Within these stylized silly confines were supposed to believe that Phillip and Steven fall seriously in love. Instead its as if McGregor and Carrey are in different movies. McGregor plays his sweet-natured fragile Phillip with as much depth as the character allows and Carrey is all rubber face and zany smiles. Its not that a gay love story need be as weighty as Brokeback Mountain but it should have believable chemistry. There was a more convincing connection in the short-lived bond between Steven and Jimmy. The con-artist scenes are giddy but lifeless. Maybe this is because its hard to care about a protagonist who is so narcissistic and sociopathic however passionate he may be. Steven muses about his lifelong tendency to hide. The heart soul and wit of this story seem hidden under its overarching effort to be edgy and weird.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 3 2010 1201 a.m. ET Fine actors can reveal complex feelings in a flash. One of those flashes illuminates ""Black Swan"" moments after the heroine a ballet dancer named Nina Sayers learns that her companys artistic director has chosen her to play the Swan Queen in his ambitious new production of ""Swan Lake."" Flipping open her cellphone Nina cries ""He picked me Mommy"" In a single poignant sentence stripped of artifice Natalie Portman tells us everything we need to know about Ninas passion her immaturity her relationship with her mother and her frightening vulnerability. The director Darren Aronofsky uses all the artifice in his arsenal to portray the terrors that beset Nina in her pursuit of perfection. As she dances on the border between sanity and madness he blurs the line between reality and fantasy turning the film into a gothic horror show that is fascinating and disappointing in equal measure. Whats resplendently real though is the beauty of Ms. Portmans performance. She makes the whole lurid tale worthwhile. In the venerable tradition of ""The Red Shoes"" the ballet provides the template for the offstage drama. The film begins with the prologue to ""Swan Lake"" in which the sorcerer Rothbart casts his evil spell. Hes not the only evil sorcerer of the piece and winning a plum role isnt Ninas triumph its the start of her woes. The artistic director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) considers her ideal casting for the part of the White Swan--innocent fragile fearful--but not as he tells her repeatedly for the lustful Black Swan. That means she must learn about lust from him or risk the role being reassigned to her rival Lily. (Shes played by Mila Kunis who makes evil entertaining.) ENLARGE Natalie Portman as a troubled dancer in Black Swan. Fox Searchlight Mr. Cassel has long been a formidable force in French films and his presence here is a strong one but under the spell of the movies director its also a heavy and graceless one. Thomas is Mr. Aronofskys point man for horror though far from its only source. Barbara Hersheys portrayal of Ninas mother Erica transcends horrifying to become a tour de force of Grand Guignol and all of it in the spirit of imprisoning infantilizing love. Erica sacrificed her own negligible career as a dancer to motherhood and then to Ninas advancement. Now each time she calls her anguished daughter ""You sweet girl"" your flesh crawls just as its supposed to. And your heart aches as its supposed to at the sight of Nina whos a world-class self-punisher trying to please everyone in her life while shes being pressured and threatened--or so she imagines--on all sides ""I just want to be perfect"" she whispers to Thomas pleadingly. The touching simplicity of Ms. Portmans technique gives her character a genuine innocence. Whats more the actress dances the ballet sequences elegantly. Her work is enhanced to be sure by the limited use of a dance double and by Matthew Libatiques gorgeously fluid cinematography but the illusion is as perfect as anything Nina could have hoped for. So whats to complain about? Basically--and increasingly as the film wears on--the psychological banalities of the script which was written by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin and the disappointing familiarity of the filmmakers horror tropes. Mr. Aronofskys audiences have watched and welcomed plenty of punishment from ""Requiem for a Dream"" which expressed the horrors of heroin addiction through dazzling images to hallucinatory effect up to ""The Wrestler"" with Mickey Rourke in spectacular agony. ""Black Swan"" can be dazzling too and not only thanks to its central performance. The craftsmanship is impressive the music is powerful and the movie is never uninteresting. This time though the creep-show component isnt worthy of the theme. ENLARGE Jim Carrey as Steven Russell in I Love You Phillip Morris. Roadside Attractions I Love You Phillip Morris Theres never been a movie like this one. Thats not to say its all good or all bad though its never indifferent. Much of it is funny or affecting in surprising ways while some of it is undercut by a wildly hyperbolic style. And the production is nothing if not forthright in its depiction of gay sex. But the films singular distinction is its zest for thematic cross-dressing. ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is tragedy or something close to it decked out in comedys clothes. (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa directed from their adaptation of a book by Steve McVicker.) Jim Carrey plays Steven Russell a comedic version of a real-life con man who came out sexually in midlife and who is currently confined to a cell in a Texas prison where hes serving a 144-year sentence for escape and fraud. (A title-sequence claimer as opposed to a disclaimer reads ""This really happened. It really did."") Ewan McGregor is Phillip Morris a prisoner who becomes the one true love of Stevens life. His love for Phillip is the only constant amidst emotional and situational pandemonium. Stevens life is a downward spiral of loony escapades outlandish impersonations that sometimes succeed albeit temporarily and preposterous exploits that unlike those of Walter Mitty end consistently in failure. Watch a clip from Roadside Attractions ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. The role seems tailor-made for Mr. Carreys outlandish talents although the close fit becomes a problem when some of those exploits sacrifice all traces of plausibility in the course of showcasing the movies star. (I never believed a moment of one faux-naive sequence a cross between ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Being There"" in which Steven pretending to be a lawyer defends a woman in court.) Yet the funnyman is at his best when the going gets unfunny. The heros antics proceed from his pain; he never knew who he was as an adopted child and he still doesnt know. But the film allows us to feel that we do. Steven is a good person with sociopathic impulses a man whos been struggling all his life to find himself and to be a true lover. By the end hes batting .500. Night Catches Us Any film with Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington demands attention. Shes always appealing and hes one of Americas great actors even if his only widely recognized film role was as a member of the three-man bomb squad in ""The Hurt Locker."" This film which was written and directed by Tanya Hamilton merits admiration as an ambitious debut feature though the impact of its splendid cast is blunted by the awkward structure of its screenplay. (David Tumblety did the richly nuanced cinematography.) The story is set in 1976 when Mr. Mackies Marcus returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where hed been involved in the Black Panthers a decade before Ms. Washington plays Patricia the woman he loved. The nature of Marcuss involvement is still mysterious but the larger issue on the filmmakers mind is the nature of the Black Power movement which remains clouded in controversy. ""We dont talk about the past"" Patricia warns Marcus. ""Its too painful."" ENLARGE Jamara Griffin and Anthony Mackie in the 1970s-set drama Night Catches Us. Magnolia Pictures ""Night Catches Us""--an evocative title--uses Marcus to investigate that past even though the initial investigator is Patricias young daughter Iris; shes as fascinated as she is baffled by her familys history. The movie intercuts present action with news clips and still montages from the earlier era as well as animated snippets from political comic books whose provenance proves surprising. (The animation represents the workings of Iriss imagination.) Unfortunately all of these flashbacks dominate the film in a semicoherent way that Ms. Hamilton could not have intended. ""Youre living in the past"" Marcus tells Patricia. ""This house this neighborhood youre all fighting imaginary enemies."" Thats the problem in a nutshell. Present action is in desperately short supply. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Pi (1998) The gritty black-and-whiteness of Darren Aronofskys first feature recalls another visionary debut David Lynchs ""Eraserhead."" This one could be called ""Numberhead."" Its about Max a math genius who goes mad searching for patterns in the stock market. (Right the movie is pure fantasy.) But filthy lucre isnt the heros goal any more than a conventional sci-fi story is Mr. Aronofskys goal. Max is looking for the secret of the universe while the writer-director seeks and finds a dialectic between human emotion (mostly bleak) and deadpan Dada that also recalls Jean-Luc Godards ""Alphaville"" and Terry Gilliams retro technology in ""Brazil."" Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind (2004) A romantic comedy unlike any other this gorgeous phantasmagoria takes a question thats been posed by poets across the ages--of what is love compounded?--and examines it through fanciful scans of a scorned lovers cortex. Jim Carreys shy guy Joel receives a notice from a mysterious company Lacuna Inc. that his flaky girlfriend Clementine has chosen to have all memories of him erased from her brain. Shes played memorably by Kate Winslet. Michel Gondry directed from an original script by Charlie Kaufman. Jon Brion wrote the music. Ellen Kuras guided the gliding see-all camera. Our Song (2000) Kerry Washington made her feature debut in Jim McKays lovely little feature about the friendship of three teenage girls. The setting is Crown Heights a mainly black and Latino section of Brooklyn. The best moments are those in which the girls give voice to gnawing fears vague dreams and ardent hopes. One of them Maria (Melissa Martinez) is pregnant and adrift. Another Joycelyn or Joy (Anna Simpson) believes in her forlorn fairy-tale way that she could be Miss Universe if she wanted to be. Ms. Washingtons Lani has her life most nearly together; shes the trios candidate for success. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie review I Love You Phillip Morris - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-JailMovie review I Love You Phillip MorrisJim Carrey and Ewan McGregor star in the broad farce from the writers of Bad Santa.December 03 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic When a romantic comedy opens with kids looking for shapes in the clouds and one young lad spots a ""wiener"" a and hes not talking hotdogs a its a pretty good bet that a conventional love story is not going to follow. That is most definitely the case in the audacious and wildly out-of-control farce of ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor as a match made in prison. And trust me that is a long way from heaven. Though the film and its many whimsical visual and musical flourishes evokes a kind of warped funhouse effect this is a true-life tale of a small-time lawman turned con artist and the lengths he goes to for the man of his dreams. So it was never going to be an easy project. But John Requa and Glenn Ficarra veteran writing partners with the coal-in-your-stocking fun of ""Bad Santa"" their best work to date wanted to give it a try and are making their feature directing debut as well. Its clear from first frame to last that the filmmakers decided to go broad very broad with a story that swings between hysterical hyper-sexual bizarre surprisingly tender and just plain awful. This is one mixed bag of a movie. Based on the novel by Steve McVicker ""Phillip Morris"" follows the strange saga of Steven Russell (Carrey) which begins in Texas in the mid-80s. Steven is a small-town deputy living a conventional life complete with a wife Debbie ( Leslie Mann) and child singing in the church choir and telling bad jokes to anyone who will listen. Theres a horrific car accident an ""Im gay"" epiphany and like a chameleon Steven sheds the first of the many skins he will lose over the course of the film. He trades Texas for Miami strolling South Beachs boulevards in blinding white polyester with his first great love Jimmy ( Rodrigo Santoro). Jimmys AIDS-related death and some questionable business deals put Steven in a tailspin that soon sends him to jail and into the arms of the shy Southern sweetness of Phillip Morris (McGregor). Amped up by director of photography Xavier Grobets eye-popping Technicolor style (at times it outshines the performances) heres where things really get crazy as Steven concocts one outlandish scheme after another to stay with Phillip. His actions lead to an endless spin-cycle of escape and incarceration sometimes legal often not with Steven brilliantly inventive at outsmarting the penal system. On the outside he has a Midas touch too a good thing since he wants to give Phillip the world. All Phillip wants is someone he can trust. Lovers quarrels and longer jail sentences ensue. Beyond the stereotypes and clichA(c)s a Steven and Jimmy have matching Chihuahuas Steven and Phillip have matching cars a the movie doesnt really have much to say about being gay being in love or being in prison beyond making the point that if youre jailed in Texas youve got a better-than-even chance of escaping. But the biggest problem is Carrey himself. The actor has always been a tough nut to crack. Sometimes his goofball sensibility is exactly whats called for whether its in the lowbrow ""Dumb amp; Dumber"" or the far more clever ""Liar Liar."" When hes stepped away from all that manic energy hes capable of delivering something wonderful like the heartbroken man clinging to love in the memory poem ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or the unsuspecting reality TV star in ""The Truman Show."" Though Carrey seems to be giving his heart to Stevens romance with Phillip and pouring a lot of sweat equity into very vigorous sex he never gets beyond his Jim Carrey-ness to let us discover the character. As for McGregor the film will likely be little more than a footnote in his career. Whats worrisome though is the subtext. ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" too often plays as an apology as if the directors are trying to compensate for the gay love story by pushing everything over the top. Were they hoping all the silliness would make it more palatable for the mainstream? I thought we were beyond that. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Salmon Fishing in the YemenMarch 9 2012Movie review Crazy Stupid LoveJuly 29 2011Movie review BeginnersJune 3 2011One love many escapes in I Love You Phillip MorrisJanuary 18 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTJailEwan McgregorCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-phillip-morris-20101203,0,791154.story",200,iloveyouphillipmorris22,iloveyouphillipmorris,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet I Love You Phillip Morris premiered at the Sundance Film Festival nearly two years ago and its long uncertain journey to theaters--with release dates announced and withdrawn ad infinitum--reveals a timidity that stands in stark contrast to a comedy thats crazily recklessly fearless. Perhaps America isnt ready for a lusty gay relationship between two big stars like Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor--or for yuks like one where the former scoffs at the latter for spitting rather than swallowing--but the movie seems cheerfully oblivious to any squeamishness on the audiences part. Making their directorial debut Glenn Ficarra and John Requa the writing team responsible for the filthy alternative Christmas classic Bad Santa apply the same go-for-broke nastiness to a story of love and crime that fully warrants it. This is Catch Me If You Can with two middle fingers raised in the air. Based on the book by Houston Chronicle journalist Steve McVicker I Love You Phillip Morris marvels at the impulsive diabolical brilliance of Steven Jay Russell (Carrey) a.k.a. ""King Con"" a multi-talented con artist who frustrated and embarrassed detectives and jailers for years. In a breathless series of scenes its established that Steven upon discovering he was adopted became so motivated to impress his birth mother that he fashioned a straight-arrow life as a Georgia policeman and a respected husband and father of two. When he finally meets his mother and is shown the door Steven embraces who he really is--gay--and proceeds to build a new life in South Beach on embezzlement and fraud. While in prison he meets Phillip Morris (McGregor) a sweet but taciturn love object and his criminal exploits are pushed to another level. Beyond the aggressive black comedy most of it funny and the rest compensated for via pacing I Love You Phillip Morris examines the fascinating contradictions of a man who spun an elaborate web of lies in order to sustain a love that was fundamentally true. Carreys performance dominates McGregors and properly so since Steven and Phillips relationship is forged (and sabotaged) almost entirely by the force of Stevens imagination. The films only major flaw is that the two actors are never fully convincing as a couple; when it comes time to feel the breadth of Stevens love for Phillip the emotions dont materialize. Ficarra and Requa are more comfortable being bad The nastier the film gets the better it is.

No problem Its a true story -- a freak opportunity perfectly alluring to writer-directors Glenn Ficara and John Requa the oddball-loving gents who wrote Bad Santa. There really is a Phillip Morris (not related to the tobacco company). Hes a mild fellow here played with a melting trusting smile by Ewan McGregor. Morris was serving prison time (stemming from an arrest for an overdue rental car) when he had the cataclysmic (mis?)fortune to fall in love with Steven Russell here played by Jim Carrey in a boundary-busting performance of spectacular commitment and delicacy. Russell was in jail at the time for insurance fraud. But ""fraud"" doesnt begin to describe the creative audacity with which the fellow conned his way through life especially after he met Morris. (These days Russell is serving a 144-year sentence in a maximum-security facility in Texas.) And ""conned"" doesnt do justice to the devotion that propelled so many of Russells ingenious illegal schemes so that he could live with his beau in luxurious style outside prison walls. I Love You Phillip Morris pulls off ingenious schemes of its own It dramatizes a highly unusual relationship -- thats an understatement -- between two men in which homosexual love and sex ardently enacted on screen in a finely tuned tour-de-force interplay between two movie stars is just another piece of the story. And it sustains a tone of compassionate hilarity in which oversize romantic gestures coexist with gigantic scams. A film featuring lesser-known actors might have made for a ""realer"" production. But whos kiddin whom? Its the beaming movie-star intensity of the complicated comic Carrey in the role of the dominant lover and Obi-Wan Kenobi McGregor as the gentle beloved that makes this unfettered stranger-than-fiction picture pop.

Premiering at Sundance in January 2009 the movie was a near-casualty of nervous-nellie U.S. distributors--more comfortable with innocuous gay genres like the homosexual weepie or the martyr biopic--and countless release delays. In the interim weve bided our time with such high-profile big-screen depictions of man-man love as Bruno pantomiming oral on the ghost of Rob Pilatus and Colin Firths suicidal fusspot furtively nuzzling Matthew Goode in a Single Man flashback. Save it Mary Nothing tops ILYPMs Jim Carrey as a top sweatily giddily ass-plowing a mustached muscle-daddy in the most gloriously raunchy unrepentant moment in the an(n)als of Hollywood A-listers doing gay-for-pay. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Making their directorial debut the screenwriting team Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Bad Santa) adapted then-Houston Press reporter Steve McVickers 2003 book about the real-life adventures of con man Steven Russell (Carrey) who once maintained a highly hetero upright life as a Virginia Beach cop and church organist sweetly tucking in his daughter at night and saying prayers with wife Debbie (Leslie Mann). But after a near-fatal car crash while driving home from the aforementioned d.l. cornholing Steven storms out of the closet (""Im gonna be a fag"") and moves to Florida sashaying down a South Beach boulevard with hot boyfriend Jimmy (Rodrigo Santoro). Upscale lavender lifestyles come with steep price tags however and ""living as high on the gay hog as I wanted to"" leads Steven to credit-card and insurance fraud--and to prison in Texas where he meets the delicate diabetic love of his life Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor a veteran of Uranian desire after 1998s Velvet Goldmine). As they slow-dance and smooch to ""Chances Are"" in their cell during a prison riot Steven vows to take care of everything a lovers promise that leads only to more spectacular crimes.It also leads to the best performance of Carreys career. Where his unleashed id and rubbery body once served him as the new Jerry Lewis that 90s persona confined him to playing one sexless cretin after another. His later attempts as a more brooding romantic lead in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Yes Man (2008) found him struggling to project emotional vulnerability coming across instead as a tamped-down listless narcissist. But in ILYPM Carrey finds the perfect outlet for his manic energy Id and libido are fused with Steven driven by actual lust and the unwavering--and completely believable--determination to provide for his fragile boyfriend.That Steven is both a die-hard romantic and a sociopath gives the filmmakers rich opportunities to tweak sodomite stereotypes just as they scabrously destroyed Kris Kringle in Bad Santa. ""Is the gay thing and stealing something that goes hand-in-hand?"" asks wide-eyed Debbie (with whom Steven maintains a close relationship even after the rainbow flags start flying) about her newly out arrested ex. Jimmy responds with ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" but Jean Genet certainly thought so. Make no mistake ILYPM isnt a heady treatise on queer outlaws a la Todd Hayness Poison. But Ficarra and Requa do place Steven and Phillip firmly in the tradition of eternally devoted criminal lovers a province reserved almost exclusively for straights onscreen (think Badlands). The film also acknowledges the economy of sexual servicing behind bars without phobically dwelling on it--a casualness about gay lust further revealed in the carnal relationship Steven and Phillip randy while in stir continue having once sprung enjoying some vigorous offshore fellating during a Key West vacation.ILYPMs boldest gambit (but one based entirely on fact) finds Steven in his greatest scam trying to fake his own death (I wont say how)--a set piece that hilariously dares to send up the Academys gay necrophilia in which the only good homo is a dead one (cf. Philadelphia Milk). ""Loves the reason Im layin here dyin"" Carrey says in drawled voiceover at the films beginning before flashing back to the insane Eros-fueled follies that led him to the hospital bed where hes currently flatlining. Though end credits reveal the fate of the real-life Russell the directors and Carrey prefer to close with an image suggesting an irrepressible and unbreakable (if incorrigible) man--a perfect ending to a film that advances the homosexual agenda without straight pity condescension or self-satisfaction.1 Tan and tannerGlenn Watson Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Melissa Anderson Follow MelissEAnderson Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Georgias Steven Russell has led quite a life. Hes a subject ripe for documentary treatment but its understandable why Bad Santa writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have turned his wild CV into madcap comedy for their directing debut. Unleashing Jim Carrey makes a sort of sense since his fast-talking energy might help us buy Russells credibility-defying exploits. Unfortunately though the bizarre true-life aspect gets swamped by Carreys ramped-up zeal delivering a series of showpiece flourishes which dazzle at first but then prove wearing.Still you cant accuse cast or filmmakers of lacking caution since the treatment barrels through locations and chronology and its eyebrow-raising to have Carrey and Ewan McGregor - as sweet-natured fellow jailbird Phillip Morris - playing frisky gay lovers. Such forthrightness definitely makes the movie culturally significant (and may explain why US distributors have been reluctant to handle it) yet for all that it never manages to match its robust humour with a convincing love story. Maybe we dont quite buy Jim and Ewans hots for one another maybe the writing makes Carreys character too much of a psychotic narcissist while rendering McGregor in terms of fluffy-bunny passivity but either way it just aint happening. Loved the chutzpah but the heart and the funny bone are left relatively untroubled.

Jim Carrey play this role like he plays every role; totally devoid of sincerity meaning and purpose. To say he is miscast is the understatement of the century. Maybe he took the gig pro bono to get some movement back into his deservedly languishing career as a rubber faced over acting hack but whoever cast him for this needs shooting. The story as it exists has more than enough depth for a far greater exploratory of what happens when ones nature and the higher calling of love intersect but no. Were served up this dogs breakfast. I nearly walked out on this fiasco of a film on several occasions and in the end gave myself over to waiting for the denouement of this train wreck of offensiveness. The one bright glimmer in the fiesta of shit is Ewan McGregors eponymous role. He adds yet another string to his bow demonstrating a quite extraordinary range as a character actor. Overall an evening spent at home plucking lint from your naval will be vastly more satisfying than this bushpig of a production.

I thougt it was hilarious and give it the vot for the best film Ive seen thi year.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 25 2010AntFeaturedUtter utter cobblers - pointless meaningless story and Ewen Macgregors acting was wooden and Carreys wasnt much betterFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 23 2010katyFeaturedLoved it Made me laugh so muchFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 23 2010katyFeaturedLoved it Made me laugh so muchFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 23 2010laurenFeaturedIf youre looking for meaniful and intellectual or if youre looking for cliche jim carrey dont go you wont enjoy this film. I really enjoyed this film it was fun and quirky and quick. If youre more of a slap stick kind of person the humour might not register as this film is very definitely american humour. I dont agree with Trevors review in that I completely bought Carrey and McGregors relationship. I think people might be put off because they know that the actors are heterosexual and so find it difficult to suspend disbelief. Either way if you relax into this film and just let it be what it is and allow yourself to be entertained I think youll have fun.

Jim Carrey is annoying at the best of times but here hes unbearableFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 20 2010DickyFeaturedTOaEUR(tm)s hit the nail on the head with this review. This is a humorous movie well suited to both Carey and McGregor. As Trevor Johnston says part way through it seems to run out of steam for a while and then picks up pace and humour again towards the end. Certainly the rest of the audience seemed to find it amusing. . ItaEUR(tm)s unlikely either star will look back at this movie citing it as the one that really boosted their career - for both of them itaEUR(tm)s cash in the bank. ItaEUR(tm)s unlikely youaEUR(tm)ll want to see it a second time and I doubt itaEUR(tm)ll do well when it comes out on DVD. On the whole this isnaEUR(tm)t a bad movie and its 2 star rating from Time Out is accurate.

Expected McEwan and Carey to bring something to the film but I sat there slack jawed at car crash cinema. Nice idea but shame about the execution one for the bargain bin at Lidl. I found the ending a sick joke making light of another sterotype that should have been left as a bad taste idea. Disappointed that McEwan has taken the money for such a poor script and character bereft of any substance.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 17 2010RichardFeaturedI love Carrey films but this was a huge disappointment everyone has a different sense of humour but I just didnt find it funny.

Less of a comedy than a hilarious tragedy ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" stars Jim Carrey in his most complicated comedic role since ""The Cable Guy"" and as a character so criminal and gay it will leave auds both laughing and stunned. The rawness of the script by helmers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and sexual bluntness of Carrey and Ewan McGregors onscreen romance could limit the films exposure but curiosity about Carreys ""conversion"" will be a big draw. And no one can say that all involved werent swinging for the fences. Based on a real-life story and the novel by onetime Houston Chronicle reporter Steve McVicker ""Phillip Morris"" (the cigarette maker spells it with one L) is largely a portrait of a born criminal During his larcenous lifetime Steven Russell (Carrey) masquerades as a lawyer and a CEO passes bad checks and commits bank fraud insurance fraud and credit card fraud. That the film is a gay romance -- Phillip Morris (McGregor) will become the love and motivating force of Stevens life -- doesnt change the fact the lead character is a sociopath whose first instinct when faced with difficulty is to find some felonious way around it. Helmers Ficarra and Requa (who penned the equally transgressive ""Bad Santa"") load the first 10 minutes of ""Phillip Morris"" with so much action and development one cant help but get swept away After the young Steven is told hes adopted (the scene with his parents is priceless) he resolves to be the best person he can be grows up to be a Georgia policeman plays organ in church marries Debbie (a terrific Leslie Mann) has two kids infiltrates the police computer to find his real mother (Mary Louise Burke) is rebuffed by her goes into a tailspin has a nasty car crash and emerges from it vowing never to live a lie again Hes a gay man and hes going for it. And he starts living one lie after another. Carrey has always been a very physical comedian and though ""Phillip Morris"" never overplays that fact Carreys body is a large part of the comedy particularly when Steven moves to Florida and adopts a flamboyant lifestyle and a flamboyant boyfriend (Rodrigo Santoro). Steven also cultivates a South Beach existence on a Costco income. ""Being gay is really expensive"" he discovers so he starts kiting checks and collecting maxed-out credit cards eventually going to prison where he meets gentle blond cell nymph Phillip Morris. Its hard to tell how viewers will react to ""Phillip Morris"" which has a distinct vein of darkness running beneath its glossy well-lit well-costumed surfaces. The direction is more than adept -- many of the laughs erupt at the end of scenes as Carrey or McGregor toss off some seemingly random line and it sticks. The cutting juxtaposition of scenes and reaction shots hit their targets precisely with Stevens occasional suicidal plunge turned into a laugh. But given all the references to oral sex the clingy physicality of Steven and Phillip and the one spectacular ride-em-cowboy sex scene involving Carrey ""Phillip Morris"" will give some fans of ""Ace Ventura"" heart attacks Production values are topnotch particularly the lush cinematography of Xavier Perez-Grobet (""Before Night Falls"") and the editing of Thomas J. Nordberg. I Love You Phillip MorrisProductionA Europacorp presentation of a Mad Chance production. (International sales CAA Los Angeles.) Produced by Andrew Lazar Far Shariat.
