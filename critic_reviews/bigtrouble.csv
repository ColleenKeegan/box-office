Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery BIG TROUBLE Comedy. Starring Tim Allen Rene Russo Tom Sizemore and Dennis Farina. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Big Trouble"" is an ensemble comedy based on the novel by humorist Dave Barry . It was originally scheduled to be released on Sept. 21 but the Sept. 11 attacks delayed it. Anyone who sees it now will understand why. The picture is a Miami crime story with laughs rather like a cheerfully convoluted Elmore Leonard picture except with no menace no malice and no edge. This is like denatured Leonard cute and forgettable -- except for the one thing about it thats unforgettable Of all the films released since Sept. 11 this is the one that most seems like an artifact from a different time. ""Big Trouble"" revolves around a suitcase containing a nuclear bomb smuggled from an arsenal of the former Soviet Union. The Russian mafia sells it to a sleazy businessman (Stanley Tucci) who is robbed of it by a pair of bumbling crooks. Ultimately the suitcase story ropes in the entire cast -- Rene Russo as an unhappy wife; Dennis Farina as a long-suffering hit man and Tim Allen as a journalist turned advertising man. Its all in fun and to be fair there is some fun. The talented cast and the occasional wisecrack keep the film from caving in. But some movies are just cursed and ""Big Trouble"" is one of them. It satirizes lax airport security and the incompetence of the workers. It contains an airplane hijacking scene played for comedy and also shows an unarmed man taking on the hijackers. Its not that the movie is in bad taste -- how could it be? It was made in innocence. The problem is that its impossible to watch it without being reminded of exactly the sort of thing people go to comedies to forget. Were its mood a bit harsh ""Big Trouble"" might have seemed prescient. The movie even squeezes laughs out of the FBIs denying a foreign suspect his constitutional rights. But because the tone is so light so genial and eager to please the whole enterprise seems the opposite of prescient. It seems naive almost delusional. . This film contains mild violence and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle NATIONAL LAMPOONS VAN WILDER  Comedy. Starring Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid. Directed by Walt Becker. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In its 95 minutes of screen time ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" gives audiences exactly one big spontaneous unambiguous laugh. The other laughs are collaborative by nature Viewers have to force themselves into a certain frame of mind and pretend theyre getting their moneys worth. So the question is . . . how much is that one laugh worth? Normal life presents at least one laugh every 95 minutes and when it doesnt theres always video. So ""Van Wilder"" has to go down as a failed comedy. Its just not enough of a comedy. It tries to be other things too. Between jokes about canine testicles teen suicide deaf people and people unwittingly consuming animal semen ""Van Wilder"" attempts to be a character study and a romance. But its efforts in those directions are halfhearted and borrowed or at least seem that way after the goiter joke. The movies one almost-saving grace is Ryan Reynolds who in the title role has the insouciance and hairline of the young Chevy Chase. Van is the big man on his college campus. He loves it so much he has stayed in school for seven years. Someone should have told him about grad school the respectable way of doing the same thing. The story revolves around two events. Vans dad cuts him off financially forcing Van to raise tuition money as a party organizer. And the school newspaper sends young Gwen (Tara Reid) to do an expose on the perennial student. So the two spend time together and . . . but wait lets not give anything away. When it runs out of ways to be funny ""Van Wilder"" resorts to schmaltz. It wants us to understand Van as a sensitive person the spirit of mirth who brings out the best in people blah blah blah. A vulgar comedy should have the courage of its own vulgarity. Romance and projectile vomiting dont mix. . This film contains nudity and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle TROUBLE EVERY DAY Drama. Starring Vincent Gallo and Beatrice Dalle. Directed by Claire Denis. (Not rated. 99 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . Vincent Gallo is so creepy in ""Trouble Every Day"" that even in the scene where he gets out of the shower he looks as if he could use a shower. He plays an American physician in Paris whose honeymoon is spoiled by his growing impulse to go cannibal and devour his wife not to mention the French maid and every other woman he finds attractive. This cannibal is particular Theyve got to be cute. The picture was directed by Claire Denis a French filmmaker with an eye for the strange and erotic. But ""Trouble Every Day"" is an artistic flop torpedoed by an idiotic premise and by Denis turgid approach to the story. Denis can do original things with a camera and here and there a distinct moment leaps out but the moments leap from a monotonous and boring void. In ""Trouble Every Day"" the doctor (Vincent Gallo) cant kiss his new wife without having to go off by himself to restrain his cannibalistic impulses. It makes one wonder how the relationship progressed all the way to the altar. In a parallel story line Beatrice Dalle is a French cannibal whose romantic trysts always end with her mouth and face covered with her boyfriends blood. Shes a bad romantic bet. Gallo is peculiar casting to play an ostensibly levelheaded physician with a secret and shameful passion. With his piercing eyes unshaved face and overgrown mustache he looks more like a cannibal than a doctor and his acting -- which in other films has been fiery -- is completely opaque. The movie might have benefited from the casting of a Greg Kinnear type someone who could conceivably pass himself off as an amiably bland professional. Denis knows how to film a sex scene for maximum erotic effect placing the camera close up an inch or two away from the skin where a lovers eyes would be. But here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe theres a metaphor here but figuring it out wouldnt make ""Trouble Every Day"" any better. . This film contains nudity strong language and graphic violence. -- Mick LaSalle TEDDY BEARS PICNIC Comedy. Starring Ming Na Fred Willard and Henry Gibson. Directed by Harry Shearer. (Not rated. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Teddy Bears Picnic"" is a limp satire of the Bohemian Grove the Northern California summer retreat that attracts some of the most powerful men in politics business and entertainment. Harry Shearer who wrote and directed brings together a host of talented comic actors but never finds much to do with them. The satire is unfocused while the story goes nowhere. Too bad. The material is ripe for satire. Shearer identifies some Bohemian Grove types but he doesnt go much past that. Henry Gibson exudes a creepy decadence as a broken-down old billionaire named Clifford Sloane. Look into his eyes and you can almost see the toxic waste dumps the sweat shops the lives destroyed. Fred Willard has one or two amusing moments as a conservative senator hoping to make a run for the presidency. Others play types derived less from observation than from previous satires. For example theres George Wendt as a gung-ho Air Force general a warmed-over version of George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Shearer who co-starred in ""This Is Spinal Tap"" makes a few feints in the direction of a story involving a newscaster (nicely played by Ming Na) and a plan to smuggle video footage out of Zambesi Glen as the retreat is called here. Nothing comes of it. The movie ends with the audience still waiting for the plot to kick in. Shearer did research on the Bohemian Grove and yet failed to capture the distinct nature of the Bohemian banter. Anyone who has ever spent 10 minutes with these guys knows its harsh -- lots of hostility disguised as friendliness or friendliness disguised as banter. These fellows have a mode of communication unto themselves. Shearer did however notice the other thing that the guys with the most money tell the funniest jokes. . This film contains adult language and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 6 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 7 Trump Jr. accuses Obama of plagiarizing a line from his speech 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam 10 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War...

This review was corrected on March 28 2002. A genially amusing ensemble farce that doesnt quite achieve enough momentum for liftoff ""Big Trouble"" is an easy-to-take easier-to-forget trifle that unfortunately likely will be best remembered as a footnote to terrible events far beyond the control of the talent involved. Originally screened for critics early last fall pic was bumped from scheduled September 2001 release within hours of the 9/11 horrors as Disney decision-makers figured auds wouldnt be in right mood for a comedy that climaxes with the smuggling of a suitcase-size nuclear weapon aboard a commercial aircraft. Now slotted for April 5 wide release ""Big Trouble"" should post respectable but unspectacular B.O. numbers before finding wider acceptance as cable and homevid product. Its debatable of course whether enough time has passed for ticket-buyers to accept gags that pre-9/11 would have seemed innocuous. In addition to playing the bomb-in-a-suitcase card ""Big Trouble"" goes for laughs by showing how comically easy it might be to smuggle a gun past airport security guards. Theres also a squirm-inducing moment during a conversation between a Miami cop (Janeane Garofalo) and two FBI agents (Omar Epps Dwight ""Heavy D"" Myers) -- the cop makes the assumption that no one has ever triggered a nuclear weapon within the U.S. and the agents exchange a nervous glance. Based on a novel by humorist Dave Barry ""Big Trouble"" tends to shamble instead of sprint during opening scenes that introduce characters destined to intersect in and around Miami. Eliot Arnold (Tim Allen) a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for the Miami Herald loses his job after an explosive encounter with his boss. Since there would be no movie if he simply went to work for another newspaper Eliot is quickly reduced to working in advertising and -- much worse in the eyes of teen son Matt (Ben Foster) -- driving a totally uncool Geo. The complications begin when Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci) a corrupt businessman arouses the ire of his even more corrupt superiors by threatening to expose their dirty dealings. (A nice touch Arthur is described as ""one of the few Floridians who was not confused when he voted for George W. Bush."") So the superiors call a couple of hit men (Dennis Farina Jack Kehler) who arrive at Herks home on the very same evening that Matt plans to ""ambush"" Herks lovely teen stepdaughter Jenny (Zooey Deschanel) with a water squirt gun. (The ambush is part of an ongoing game not a criminal assault.) The hit men miss their target and escape but Matt is apprehended by an odd couple of cops (Garofalo Patrick Warburton). When Eliot arrives at the Herk home to claim his son hes instantly attracted to Anna (Rene Russo) Herks trophy wife. The attraction is mutual but Herk doesnt notice Hes too distracted by his comely maid Nina (Sofia Vergara) who in turn is attracted to Puggy (Jason Lee) a spacey drifter who has taken up temporary residence in a tree. Meanwhile on the other side of town Snake a dumb petty crook who claims he is ""tired of living foot to mouth"" joins forces with the even dumber Eddie (Johnny Knoxville) to rob a seedy bar that doubles as a front for international arms dealers. Unfortunately the bungling robbers grab a suitcase that contains the aforementioned nuclear weapon. Further complications arise FBI agents arrive on the scene -- and everybody winds up at an airport where the security is singularly lax. Working from a cleverly constructed screenplay adaptation by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone director Barry Sonnenfeld takes a while to get ""Big Trouble"" into the right groove of straight-faced steadily escalating wackiness. After things start rolling the pic earns chuckles and a few hearty guffaws but without delivering the inspired insanity that separates diverting time-killers from truly memorable (and yes potently commercial) comedies. Allen Garofalo and Warburton give relatively subdued perfs and their understatement serves them and pic as a whole quite well. Crafty scene-stealing pros Farina and Sizemore hit the right notes of seriocomic menace but Tucci overplays his characters sleaziness and strains too obviously for cheap laughs. Russo appears oddly tentative as though she never managed to get a handle on her role. Lee is engagingly sweet in an underwritten part. Among other supporting players Epps and Myers make strongest impressions as anxious feds. Kudos go to lenser Greg Gardiner production designer Garreth Stover and costumer Mary Vogt for their aptly exaggerated evocations of various Miami socioeconomic strata. Pic makes funny visual and aural allusions to ""Miami Vice"" right down to using the same moody-spooky Phil Collins tune ""In the Air Tonight"" employed so effectively in the TV series pilot. By the way Future film buffs will have to take care lest they confuse this ""Big Trouble"" with 1985 comedy of same title the last pic completed by director John Cassavetes.

"Trouble Mismatches Made in Miami washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Trouble Mismatches Made in Miami Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 5 2002 ""Big Trouble"" might have been the pilot episode for a series titled ""Miami Lice"" It sees most of the citizens of that lush tropical town as leeches scumbags losers el stupidos morons and tick-heads. That seems to be a consensus of Miami writers by the way. Though ""Big Trouble"" derives from a novel by the great humorist Dave Barry its conceit pretty much represents the house style on Miami which you see equally expressed in works by Carl Hiaasen Edna Buchanan and even Elmore Leonard. Were a long way from Crockett and Tubbss cool Casablanca of a place where all the men wore pastels and carried guns that were color-coordinated. No for these writers South Florida is a funny place not a cool place. Its got weird vegetation blue-haired old ladies driving 22 mph in the fast lane angry Cubans and Gator-mania. Burt Reynolds considers it home. Sylvester Stallone and Madonna once lived there. Anyone can carry a gun anywhere anytime. The traffic is bad and getting worse. The corpse has a familiar face. Its California without the manners and since there are no manners in California . . . Into the seething mosh pit that is Miami comes Barrys plot not that anyone would notice not that anyone could summarize. Its one of those first-this-happens-then-that-happens scenarios involving domestic violence stolen nuclear weapons squirt-gun murders real murders street criminals and a one-time newspaper star trying to regain the respect of his son. Just your normal comedy components. The keys are speed and timing the marks of a good lightweight which sums up ""Big Trouble"" well enough. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld who has a flair for deadpan black humor - ""The Addams Family"" and its sequel demonstrated that as did ""Men in Black."" Hes still light on his feet and the movies almost over before you know it. Its main comic device is the partnership ritual. The movie is full of partners who are weirdly mismatched yet perfect together because of their syncopation and contrast. One will always be over the top the other under the bottom; one will be loud the other quiet but disgusted. One couple is hit man Henry Algott (Dennis Farina) a slow-burn specialist who loathes the city for its vulgarity paired with Jack Kehler as another hit man but an idiot. The idiot is forever telling bad jokes which Farina simply glowers at. When Farina turns on the radio he always gets the same sports talk show whose personality is taunting Gators fans to call and they do and they have nothing to say except ""I just called."" The automatic seat belt of Farinas rental car is always lightly grazing his face and you see the rage mounting as his skin turns purple beneath his tan. (Farina a former Chicago cop is always worth watching.) The two hitters have arrived to kill a jerk named Herk (Stanley Tucci) whos embezzled money from his employers but they get mixed up with two kids on a squirt gun mission which brings in one of the kids fathers - Tim Allen as former Miami Herald humor columnist Eliot Arnold. He quickly partners up with Herk the Jerks wife Anna (Rene Russo) while his son Matt (Ben Foster) is partnering up with Annas daughter Jenny (the very funny Zooey Deschanel). Of course two cops (Janeane Garofalo and Patrick Warburton Puddy from ""Seinfeld"") investigate the mixed-up hit by .30-06 and Super Soaker. Then two street crooks (Tom Sizemore and Johnny Knoxville) who appear not to have bathed since Florida was admitted to the Union steal the bomb that Herk meant to buy from two Russians and two FBI agents (Omar Epps and Heavy D) show up. Even the pets have partners the dog and the frog. There is no point in going any further and I may have gone too far already. But the way the roundelay of partners functions and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful if unlikely to be confused with the writings of Martin Buber. The movie is already slightly famous because it was postponed from fall release after the events of Sept. 11. One of its plotlines follows the hijacking of a plane with that ticking nuclear bomb aboard. Is it safe for ""Big Trouble"" to come out now? I dont think the bomb plot is realistic enough to stir disturbing emotions or upsetting memories. This is after all the kind of movie in which traffic accidents not only mess up getaways but also liberate goats to wander through the airport. We need more of that stuff.

Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from a screenplay by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone based on the novel by Dave Barry. 85 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language crude humor and sex-related material. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article What a difference eight months make. Or dont make as the case may be. Way back before Sept. 11 Barry Sonnenfelds new film ""Big Trouble"" was scheduled for a September release. World events intervened and the film was yanked from the fall schedule due to its lengthy comedic sequence in which a bomb is smuggled through airport security detectors and onto a plane. Now its back changed not a whit. Trouble is ""Trouble"" wasnt funny then and its not funny now. Tim Allen in yet another cinematic opportunity to display his regular-guy blandness is at the center of a large ensemble cast. Hes Eliot Arnold a regular guy () in Miami caught up in events that spiral out of control involving a suitcase a spray-gun game two hit men a rather large toad some shameless Fritos product placement and the largest assortment of dim-bulb characters Ive seen in a while. Good performers such as Rene Russo (whos cartoonishly costumed here) Stanley Tucci Janeane Garofalo Jason Lee and others are abandoned by a script that makes them all appear brain-dead and there seem to be far too many characters (all oddly coming in pairs) for one short movie to juggle. And the bomb sequence guaranteed to raise eyebrows in our current climate is just plain moronic. Yes its supposed to be funny but even comedy needs a grain of truth. In the scene a bomb is clearly outlined on the airport metal detectors screen and yet waved through. Are you laughing yet? ""Big Trouble"" is based on a novel by Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry but has none of the writers trademark wit. Read any one of his 800-word columns -- hes in The Seattle Times on Mondays -- for more laughs than youll get in all 85 long minutes of ""Big Trouble.""

"USATODAY.com - Laughs win big in Big Trouble Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/07/2002 - Updated 1200 AM ET Laughs win big in Big Trouble By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Big Trouble (out of four)Stars Tim Allen Rene Russo Stanley Tucci Tom Sizemore Dennis Farina Janeane Garofalo Omar Epps Jason Lee Rating PG-13 for language crude humor and sex-related material For a while the fast-paced and zany comedy Big Trouble was in big trouble of its own. The original opening date three days after the Sept. 11 attacks was postponed because the movie included a scene in which a nuclear bomb is smuggled onto a plane by a pair of hapless hoods.But the story based on the novel by humorist Dave Barry is such silly fun that its a wonder it has taken more than six months to get this movie into theaters. Theres neither a terrorist ring nor any religious or political fanatics involved which makes this movie far easier to sit through than the heavy-handed Schwarzenegger spectacle Collateral Damage whose fall opening also was postponed. Stanley Tuccii goes nose-to-nose with a psychedelic toad in Big Trouble. As he did with Get Shorty and Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld strikes just the right tone here. In a plot that twists and turns the lives of some Miami folks collide and intertwine when theyre thrown into contact with a couple of two-bit thugs (Tom Sizemore and Johnny Knoxville). The collision involves a former columnist turned adman (Tim Allen) his son (Ben Foster) a corrupt businessman (Stanley Tucci) his unhappily married wife (Rene Russo) her wisecracking daughter (Zooey Deschanel) a hired assassin (Dennis Farina) a pair of witless police officers (Janeane Garofalo and Patrick Warburton) two FBI officials (Omar Epps and Dwight ""Heavy D"" Myers) and one spacey corn-chip-loving bystander (Jason Lee).The ensemble cast has no weak links and no one angles for a star turn. Allen is appealing as a down-on-his-luck Everyman who becomes a hero. Deschanels droll delivery is reminiscent of Thora Birch in Ghost World. Farina is a highlight as a deadpan hit man.The proceedings move so swiftly and smoothly that they are over before you know it which is exactly how a comedy should work. (More movies should emulate this 82-minute model.) The script is consistently humorous even if a few punch lines are predictable and the wit is neither highbrow nor split-a-gut funny. It takes potshots at easy targets -- Martha Stewart rabid football fans Discovery Channel factoids and cliched beer ads -- but manages to emerge winningly as an entertaining experience.And who can have trouble with that?

"CNN.com - Review Big Trouble worth a few laughs - April 4 2002 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Review Big Trouble worth a few laughs But comedy pales in comparison to previous film By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- The new film ""Big Trouble"" is an ensemble comedy just like ""Get Shorty"" (1995). It stars Rene Russo and Dennis Farina just like ""Get Shorty."" It features a rogues gallery of characters whose lives become hopelessly intertwined while caught up in a criminal scam just like ""Get Shorty."" Seeing a pattern here? Oh and theyre both directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. But theres a big and ultimately important difference. ""Get Shorty"" was based on a Elmore Leonard novel while ""Big Trouble"" is based on a book by Dave Barry. Not that Barry isnt a great humorist; he and Leonard share a dark quirkiness. But the difference between Leonard and Barry is the same as the difference between a feature film and a made-for-TV-movie. ""Big Trouble"" is amusing -- at times laugh-out-loud funny -- but its such an obvious attempt to recreate the magic that made ""Get Shorty"" such a wonderful film that you cant help but feel youve been to this fair before. Screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone surely helped contribute to the overall deja vu youll feel while watching this homage to another film made just seven years ago.

Director Barry Sonnenfeld exults in comedies built on inevitable calamity In hits like Get Shorty Men in Black and The Addams Family he excels at steering larger-than-life characters through increasingly extreme situations chilled to the temperature of matter-of-factness by his Hollywood cool. In Big Trouble the two split the difference. And the results run hot and cold. The story based on Barrys 1999 novel of the same name and adapted (with some made-for-the-movies coarseness) by screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone is about a divorced Miami newspaper columnist trying to relate to his sullen teenage son. Well about that and about an obnoxious tycoon with a disgusted wife and stepdaughter a couple of pretty smart New Jersey hitmen a couple of pretty dumb criminals a couple of harried cops a couple of ruthless FBI agents a moonbeamy hippie who lives in a tree and a sunshiny Peruvian maid. Among others. Barrys point I think is that its hard to be a family but worth the trouble. Sonnenfelds point on the other hand is that theres nothing funnier than characters operating on different speeds crashing into each other. The filmmaker couldnt care less about the particulars of a struggling father (Tim Allen) and son (Ben Foster) or a rich bored mother (Rene Russo) and her daughter (Zooey Deschanel) trapped in a hideous marriage to a braying cigar-chomping arms-dealing kingpin (Stanley Tucci) named Arthur Herk. When Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler as street-smart hitmen arrive from New Jersey to knock off said Herk Sonnenfeld nails the comic mysteries of geographic difference with sharp details about cigars steak even driving styles. There are stretches of big fun in ""Big Trouble"" and little pleasures too Deschanel delivers every one of her lines with perfect teenager-stink-bomb aim; Tom Sizemore as a dumb stick-up man does a nice reversal on his recent roles as reliable soldier; and Janeane Garofalo and Patrick Warburton as he-said-she-said cops enliven every room they galumph into. But there are too many distracting ungainly stretches of too little fun particularly involving Martha Stewart the Discovery Channel Fritos and toe sucking. And theres one moment when Barry and Sonnenfeld who both love too-muchness go too far in ways they couldnt have known would be so explosive. ""Big Trouble"" was scheduled to be released soon after Sept. 11 but was held back out of sensitivity about a subplot concerning a hijacking. In fact the sight of a nuclear bomb making its way through an airport security check is even more hideously funny now--a black laugh for which nothing in Barrys columns or Sonnenfelds oeuvre could have ever prepared us.
