Performed almost entirely in Japanese and told from the perspective of both high and low Japanese Imperial Army troops - for whom their Emperors dictum of death before surrender was to become frighteningly clear - it is an impressive work of compassionate imagination not least as a film made by an iconic American while his country is engaged in another increasingly bloody war.The colour is as drained here as in Flags... and as if to reflect the claustrophobic conditions of the Japanese troops dug-in in the tunnels and caves high above the beach on the orders of empathetic General Kuribayashi (a noble Ken Watanabe) the story (by Paul Haggis and Iris Yamashita) internalises what Flags... externalised. There are flashbacks - to Kuribayashis visits as an attache to the States or the family life of everyman Private Saigo (the slightly disappointing Kazunari Ninomiya) - but no flash-forwards. If heroism is being examined here it is that of men having the time to consider the imminence - if not the meaning - of their own demise as often by their own hand (or grenade sword or polluted water) as by the enemys. A very fine film with some surreal ironies - witness the almost imperceptible shot of the famous flag-hoisting on Mount Suribachi in extreme longshot - that bravely neither embraces grandeur nor demands the medal of masterpiece.

Clint Eastwoods latest pass at the battle of Iwo Jima is the brilliant and heart-rending masterwork that the first one might have been a brave assured war film that delves into the stories of the soldiers who fought there. That they happen to be Japanese -- that Letters From Iwo Jima is told from the imperial forces point of view -- only heightens the impact of this unforgettable film because it emphasizes a few naked truths of war. A soldier dies for his country his family his honor. He fights to his last bullet and beyond. And sometimes the enemy he fights seems less than human an unknown demon or a cipher. In Eastwoods movie the demonized foe is American a conceptual twist sure to discomfit some viewers -- even 62 years after the fact. Just as Flags of Our Fathers revisited the battle from the perspective of U.S. flag-raisers this second approach takes us straight into the tunneled-out rat holes of a lifeless smelly island. There we encounter the cerebral Gen. Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe peerlessly graceful) the Olympic medalist Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara almost his peer) the simple baker Saigo (pop star Kazunari Ninomiya) the enigmatic transfer Shimizu (Ryo Kase). Braided throughout the film are poignant epistolary reflections -- letters to and from Iwo Jima -- and occasional flashbacks to life before the war. So unspools a movie of concentrated power and focus its energies trained on just one goal to study the face of an adversary. ""I dont know anything about the enemy"" the transfer says. But he might be any soldier from any country in any war. Iris Yamashitas screenplay (with contributions from Paul Haggis) was based in part on the book Picture Letters from Commander in Chief and Kuribayashis fanciful drawings dot the film. It all progresses with seamless naturalism -- acted with economy scored with feathery dissonance by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens -- and lingers like held breath on moments of exquisite pain. A sequence with a young American captive offers simple stirring moments of understanding and regret. It doesnt exalt the Japanese finding plenty of nastiness in their ranks The cultured nobility of Kuribayashi and Nishi who both spent time in the United States and know their enemy as friends is offset by the cruelty and ignorance of fellow officers. But neither does the movie demonize them. Just as Downfall presented the Nazis as people bracing for doom inside a bunker Letters From Iwo Jima presents the Japanese as men fighting a lost cause in a cave. The island scenes are shot by cinematographer Tom Stern in the same storm-cloud palette of grays and blues that he used in last falls Flags of Our Fathers. Battles whistle and thud with the same discordant onslaught. Japanese corpses discovered in the first movie are explained crushingly in the second. But the parallels end there. Where Flags confused Letters coheres. Where Flags heaved its characters through war and psychic trauma without first allowing us all to get acquainted Letters takes such care with its protagonists that they awaken and descend from the screen. By the time the invasion begins (about an hour into the movie) we have spent enough time in their company -- digging tunnels writing home -- to regard them as living long before they die. Is it treason to weep for these men? No more than it is to applaud Eastwoods film which depicts our own humanity as one of combats lasting victims. Its absence makes men demons -- and makes war hell. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals True Religion Mens Leather Belt for 18 + free shipping Gillette Silver Blue Razor Blades 100-Pack for 14 + free... 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Refurb Astak Wireless Surveillance Camera Kit for 50 + free...

Wearing spelunking hardhats they begin exploring a network of caves and tunnels carved into Mount Suribachi during World War II. Miles of tunnels run beneath that promontory where the U.S. flag was hoisted on Feb. 19 1945 then planted again shortly afterward by five Marines and one Navy corpsman because a higher-up wanted the first for a souvenir. Though it deserved a more robust audience Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" based on James Bradleys best seller eloquently engaged the toll of combat and the burden of heroism on those flag-raisers. If Joe Rosenthals AP photo was the American way of memorializing those lost and those still fighting the burned-out machine-gun nests and network of caves are part of Japans commemoration. ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" Eastwoods astounding second-act of cinematic empathy spends a great deal of time in those dank shadowy confines with soldiers who were the enemy. In Japanese with English subtitles ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film Monday night. Come early next Tuesday the film should be named a contender for best picture when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announces its Oscar nominees. ""Letters"" is more than deserving of the consideration and this category is its rightful entry point. Telling the story of the bloodletting battle from the Japanese perspective ""Letters"" focuses on a handful of characters Shimizu a disgraced soldier from the Japanese armys elite; the appealing Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara). A nobleman who had competed in the 32 Olympics he gallops into the picture on a magnificent horse. There is a slew of disgruntled officers second-guessing their commander and skirting (or not) mutiny as defeat looms. At is core however this is a tale of a general and a conscript. Ken Watanabe of ""The Last Samurai"" plays Gen. Kuribayashi. When the general arrives on the island he finds soldiers digging trenches on the beach. An overly zealous captain beats and berates two soldiers. One of the men the captain caught complaining about the rocky no-mans-land of Iwo is Saigo a baker. When Kuribayashi sees the captain dispensing a form of rough discipline he intervenes. The baby-faced draftee (Kazunari Ninomiya) provides comic relief as well as everyman humanity. After a number of observational hikes Kuribayashi has his men start digging caves and tunnels. From those caves the outnumbered Japanese soldiers killed more than 6000 and wounded more than 17000 out of 110000 American troops. It was Kuribayashis letters home - many from the U.S. where he lived for a spell as an attache for the Empire of Japan - that inspired Eastwood to make this companion piece to ""Flags of Our Fathers."" ""Letters"" relies on missives and flashbacks to connect these enemy combatants to their families - and us to them. Later when an American soldiers letter from home is read by Baron Nishi to his men the notion of what is shared between divergent cultures is emphasized. Written by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis ""Letters"" uses the tools of classic American cinema to make its ethically righteous observations. Like ""Flags"" it mimics the aesthetic of movies that would have played during the time its set. ""Letters"" is not shot in black and white but there are stretches when youll scan the frame for a hint of color. Eastwoods adaptation of James Bradleys best seller about the flag-raisers began with the survivors scaling a makeshift Mount Suribachi at a War Bonds event. ""Flags"" began with a mountain. Elegant mournful ""Letters"" begins with digging. Elegance might be a uncomfortable word for a movie that contains jarring carnage. Gone is the delicacy of ""Flags"" much of which unfolds on the home front. On this Iwo limbs are shown feet away from their connective tissue. Men are bayoneted and torched. Eastwood has saved this imagery for the Japanese soldiers not to punish but to remind that these young soldiers also saw their comrades die horrifically. They reacted without mercy in ways that got buried that went unspoken. Literally. Out of 22000 Japanese soldiers 1063 were captured. A scene of soldiers committing suicide by grenade is one of the movies most miserable and confounding. In a society enamored of youth - yet hardly respectful of it - wisdom doesnt get its due often enough. ""Letters"" is a work of whetted craft and judgment tempered by Eastwoods years of life moviemaking and the potent tango of the two. It is the work of a mature filmmaker willing to entertain the true power of the cinema its ability to create empathy. You need not see ""Letters"" to appreciate ""Flags"" or vice versa. Taken together however they are an achievement for the ages. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.; try the Screen Team blog at denverpostbloghouse.com.

"The other side of the story - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies The other side of the story Letters is a haunting look at Iwo Jima through Japanese soldiers eyes By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 12 2007 Theres a moment in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" where the profundity of what Clint Eastwood is doing blindsides you with a wallop. The Japanese general Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe ) emerges from a cave during the fifth day of the epic World War II battle and spies a mile or so away a handful of ant-like figures raising a US flag on Mount Suribachi. Its glimpsed on the right side of the screen for a wobbly second and then its gone One of the iconic images of the 20th century viewed through the wrong end of historys telescope.That famous photo was the focus of Eastwoods other Iwo Jima movie ""Flags of Our Fathers"" -- the center from which the films many concerns radiated out. Reviewing the honorable overloaded ""Flags"" last fall I wrote ""As gifted as this director is this isnt the sort of thing he does best."" ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" by contrast is very much the sort of thing Clint Eastwood does best.Eloquent bloody and daringly simple the movie examines notions of wartime glory as closely as ""Flags of Our Fathers"" dissected heroism. The 20000 troops sent to defend the desolate island -- the first piece of Japanese soil threatened by the Allies -- understand they have no chance of winning. The Imperial navy and air force have been destroyed at the battle of Saipan and there are no reinforcements coming. The approaching U S armada is overwhelming in size and firepower. Advises one officer bleakly ""In my opinion general the best thing to do would be sink the island to the bottom of the sea.""Eastwood is much more interested in how men react to certain death than in replicating the order of battle though and ""Letters"" plays like ""The Alamo"" as remade by Jean Renoir  the visionary humanist of ""Grand Illusion ."" Were introduced to characters on every level of the defending forces from the squabbling hidebound top brass to the exhausted soldiers and we come to understand that each man -- as do all men in war -- falls into one of two camps the deluded ideologues and the stressed pragmatists.Characters like Lieutenant Ito (Shido Nakamura ) Captain Tanida (Takumi Bando ) and Colonel Adachi (Toshi Toda ) belong to the former beating their men in the name of Imperial honor and advocating tactics more cruelly macho than sensible. The potential for even the attraction to wartime atrocity sneaks in Ito shows his men a photo of a U S Army medic and tells them to shoot soldiers wearing similar uniforms. Suicide that noble samurai ideal is revealed as pathetically useless when administered in one of the movies most upsetting scenes by a hand grenade held against the belly. This says ""Letters"" is why Japan lost the war taking so many and so much down with it. Other characters by contrast recognize their leaders death-wish folly and struggle to outlive it. Watanabes General Kuribayashi is an enlightened officer who has traveled in and admires America. He mourns that it has come to this while exhorting his men to fight to the bitter end. The upper-class Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara ) a former Olympic equestrian who arrives on the island complete with his horse is revealed to be compassionate and kind sharing memories of the States with a wounded G I (Lucas Elliott ).Not all the Japanese look so kindly on their captives of course. Slowly though a central figure emerges from the chaos Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya ) a simple foot soldier -- a baker back home -- who has a grunts cynicism toward martial endeavor. Let the officer s proclaim what they will its the Saigos of the world who dig the trenches and take the bullets. Over the course of ""Letters"" this character becomes witness friend conscience catalyst commemorator and -- he hopes -- survivor. In the pitch darkness of this movie his innate goodness becomes a lifeline.As the Japanese were barely seen in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" Americans are hardly glimpsed here the uncomfortable implication being that we go to war against aspects of ourselves. (This may be especially true of aggressors When one Imperial soldier describes Americans as weak-willed and ruled by their emotions you can hear the panic in his voice.) At times ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" convulses with gore; at others the movie seems to sense the earth turning placidly beneath its characters feet. The territory covered is similar to Terrence Malicks ""The Thin Red Line"" but with a lot less poetic mucking about.Written by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis and based on the real General Kuribayashis posthumously published correspondence ""Letters"" represents filmmaking so assured it can take your breath away. Eastwood has pruned all affectation from his directing style leaving a movie that feels straight and true. Tom Sterns cinematography is leached of colors except for the red sun on the flag and the orange blooms of bombardments action and consequence. Only the score by Michael Stevens and Eastwoods son Kyle pretty and discreet as it is feels a touch obvious.Whether a film about a long-demonized wartime enemy told in a foreign language with English subtitles can reach a mass American audience remains to be seen. ""Letters"" is so good though and its maker working at such a level of mastery and respect that one hopes for the best. Eastwood views his doomed losers with a humane and pitiless sigh; he has made a movie full of ghosts and it haunts.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Clint Eastwood whose directing career continues to astound (Bird Unforgiven Mystic River Million Dollar Baby - and a paltry 26 others) has managed what few if any filmmakers have attempted. That is to offer dual projects that capture the bravery the fear the bungling the strategizing the loss of life - and taking of life - experienced by both sides in a war. More important Letters From Iwo Jima and its companion piece Flags of Our Fathers show that the demonized dehumanized ""enemy"" is in fact composed of very real very similar sorts of human beings. With Flags released in October Eastwood showed the 1945 invasion of the tiny volcanic isle from the vantage point of U.S. participants - Marines and Navy - in the historic World War II battle. Encumbered to a degree by a tricky framework (present-day interviews and layers of flashback) and a second act that described how the iconic photograph of a small band of Marines raising the American flag was co-opted by politicians back home Flags had moments of fierce intensity and insight. But despite its cutting commentary about presidents and propagandizing about the shaky nature of heroism and the making and breaking of men Flags was a flawed occasionally unfocused affair. By contrast Letters From Iwo Jima with its simpler structure and superb performances is just about perfect. In Japanese with a Japanese cast led by Ken Watanabe (as the commanding officer who knows that his mission and men are doomed) and Kazunari Ninomiya (a young baker who leaves his bride back home to join the Imperial Army) the film offers a powerful study of a nation and military culture rooted in honor. But it also shows how the realities of war - and the mounting hopelessness of Japans Iwo Jima stand - clashed with the Imperial Armys ""death before surrender"" mandate. Watanabe who played Tom Cruises antagonist-turned-mentor in The Last Samurai stars as Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi a gentleman officer whose prewar visits to the States afford him a view of America and Americans far different from the one promulgated by his commanders. Kuribayashi arrives on Iwo Jima in the weeks before the U.S. attack surveying the terrain and talking to his troops. He writes long eloquent letters home embellished with lovely drawings and sketches. (Crash writer-director Paul Haggis used the real Kuribayashis letters discovered decades after the war to shape the screenplay which was written with Iris Yamashita.) But the generals humor and easygoing rapport with the conscripts engenders the resentment of his fellow officers. Ninomiya a Japanese pop star with a shaggy wide-eyed demeanor plays Saigo a soldier who has left his wife and infant daughter back home for this desolate place and whose comments laced with irony and fatalism border on treason - at least as far as his immediate superiors are concerned. As the troops build a vast network of tunnels and fortifications artillery fire punctuates their talk - and rocks the ground beneath them. The men share stories about friends and family. They wonder if theres any hope of getting out alive. Although Letters From Iwo Jima is very much a pair with Flags of Our Fathers - intersecting at several points with the same swift chilling deadly confrontations - it is possible to see one without the other. And it is possible to come away especially from a viewing of Letters but also from Flags with a deeper sense of the futility but also the seeming inevitability of war. Letters From Iwo Jima  (out of four stars) Produced by Clint Eastwood Steven Spielberg and Robert Lorenz directed by Eastwood written by Paul Haggis and Iris Yamashita based on the book Picture Letters From Commander in Chief photography by Tom Stern music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens distributed by Warner Bros.

Kazunari Ninomiya and Nae star in Clint Eastwoods World War II drama ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" with Ken Watanabe Kazunari Ninomiya Tsuyoshi Ihara Ryo Kase Shidou Nakamura Nae. Directed by Clint Eastwood from a screenplay by Iris Yamashita. 140 minutes. Rated R for graphic war violence. In Japanese with English subtitles. Egyptian. Both ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" Clint Eastwoods elegant pair of World War II dramas end on a wordless haunting note ""Flags"" concludes with the sound of a breeze gently blowing a flag; ""Letters"" on the echo of waves softly crashing on a shore. These are unexpected images on which to close crowded violent war stories but both fit perfectly Eastwood has found the quiet soul of each film. The flag still flies the waves forever ebb and flow. ""Letters"" written by Iris Yamashita is the mirror image of the story of the battle of Iwo Jima depicted in ""Flags"" from the perspective of the other side. Initially through letters we meet several Japanese soldiers sent to the island with the knowledge that they may well not return. Under the command of Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) they endure a long combat retreating into an elaborate network of caves and pondering their brief future. These soldiers approach their fate with talk not of how they will prevail but of duty and honor. ""I trust that you will fight with honor"" says the general in a pre-battle speech. ""No one is allowed to die until he has killed 10 enemy soldiers. Do not expect to return home alive."" In washed-out tones of brown and khaki mimicking the colors of the troops uniforms (blood used sparingly is startlingly crimson seeming to sear a hole in the screen) the film plays out in a mood of resignation and control. The soldiers emerge not as lockstep minions but nuanced individuals. Kuribayashi leads the troops with an imposing dignity but in his letters home apologizes profusely for not ""attending to the kitchen floor before I left."" We see Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a baker receiving his draft notice while his very young wife sobs; touchingly he promises his unborn baby that he will come home. These we realize are the ""enemy"" referred to in ""Flags""; likewise in ""Letters"" the enemy of whom they speak are the all-too-real American soldiers in ""Flags."" Eastwood has achieved something remarkable with this pair of films Together they make a war story without an enemy. Both sides are made real; both fight with honor; both write letters home and dream of wars end. In ""Letters"" the Japanese army is shaken by a letter found on a wounded American soldier. Read aloud the letter is from the soldiers mother with quiet news from home and a final exhortation to ""always do what is right because it is right. Love Mom."" A Japanese soldier ponders those words. ""I was taught that they were savages"" he says ""but his mothers words were the same as my mother."" In the caves director of photography Tom Stern finds enigmatic shadows and thin light illuminating the soldiers drawn faces; on the shore the sunshine feels cold. The letters (found in an epilogue by contemporary archaeologists digging on Iwo Jima) emerge into the light many years after they were buried letting those soldiers -- on both sides -- live again.

"Iwo Jima Letter perfect | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIwo Jima Letter perfectIn Clint Eastwoods Letters from Iwo Jima his majestic followup to Flags of Our Fathers the director exhibits more than just unusual sympathy for a foreign aggressor and earns a four-star review as a result.In Eastwoods Letters from Iwo Jima Japanese solders stationed on Iwo Jima eventually realize the terrible truth that the island has fallen to the Americans and that they are on a suicide mission.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 12 2007 Letters From Iwo Jima Starring Ken Watanabe Kazunari Ninomiya Tsuyoshi Ihara and Ryo Kase. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 138 minutes. At the Varsity. It is February 1945 the endgame of World War II and the American assault on the strategic Japanese island of Iwo Jima is gaining ground.Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) the unflappable commander of Iwos 22000 Japanese troops gazes wordlessly from a distance towards Mount Suribachi the highest point on the narrow isle of rock and sulphur. He can barely make out the U.S. flag flying on the summit proclaiming American dominance. ""Suribachi has fallen"" his bitter subordinate Lt. Ito (Shidou Nakamura) tells Kuribayashi. But the flag as tiny and indistinct as it is says it all. The Americans are winning and the defence of Iwo has become a suicide mission for Kuribayashi and his men.This scene in Letters from Iwo Jima Clint Eastwoods majestic conclusion of his two-part meditation on the true cost of war is the muted flip-side to the heavy symbology of Flags of our Fathers in which the raising of the Stars and Stripes was the story.Iwo Jima is restrained where Flags was heavy handed and it is much the better picture for it. In seeking to tell the Japanese side of the Battle of Iwo Jima a conflict most people know only from the iconic photo of Marines raising the flag on Suribachi Eastwood exhibits more than just unusual sympathy for a foreign aggressor.He frees himself from the albatross of indecision that bedevilled him in Flags a worthy film freighted with mixed messages. By focusing so resolutely on the Marines in the Iwo Jima photo and guiltily assessing the celebrity hoopla that attended them back home he was unsure of what he was really trying to say. Was it really so terrible to wave the flag about a flag raising when it served to raise billions of war-relief dollars to save untold American lives?Letters From Iwo Jima suffers from no such split personality. Eastwood remains on the island shifting perspective from the beaches of the American landing to the hilltop caves and tunnels the Japanese dug to give them what they thought would be a tactical advantage over the invaders.It is not much of an advantage as Kuribayashi realizes only too well even before he arrives at Iwo in the summer of 1944. The Americans have been steadily moving towards the outer islands of Japan decimating the countrys navy and air force and Iwo is the most important of the Empires remaining fortresses. The island can be used as a landing strip for attacks on Tokyo some 1200 kilometres to the north. ""Do not expect to return home alive"" Kuribayashi tells his new charges who are not sure what to make of him. His reputation as the former chief of the Imperial Guard is impeccable and his military credentials are second to none. And yet the General spent many years in America before the war making many friends there. Could his loyalties be divided and his judgement suspect?This is the concern of the officers who have been running Iwo prior to Kuribayashis arrival who believe that the best strategy is to build fortresses on the beach to meet the Americans head-on. They view the Generals hillside plan as a foolish waste of time and energy. Other Iwo residents appreciate Kuribayashis obvious intelligence personal integrity and cultural refinement. He finds a kindred spirit in Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) a champion equestrian who befriended American movie stars while competing in the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932. Nishi has a stash of Johnnie Walker he shares with the general.The rank-and-file soldiers value Kuribayashi for his tough decisions tempered with compassion. Most grateful are baker-turned-fighter Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) who desperately wants to see his infant daughter born while he has been on Iwo and former military policeman Shimizu (Ryo Kase) who was exiled to Iwo for his perceived failings as an MP. Thanks to Kuribayashis timely intervention Saigo and Shimizu are spared a beheading from a hot-headed officer.Eastwood views the situation with compassion commensurate to Kuribayashis. But Letters presented mostly in Japanese with English subtitles is by no means an apologia for Japans role in World War II. Eastwood shows vile behaviour and cruel acts on both sides.Through the device of letters sent from the island to home Eastwood extracts the essential humanity that defines all of us no matter whose side we are on. Kuribayashi apologizes to his wife for the kitchen floor he was unable to finish before being sent to Iwo. Saigo speaks longingly of the baby girl he has yet to meet. And a wounded Marine captured by the Japanese in battle carries with him a letter from his mother speaking of such prosaic concerns as a pet dog running loose in the neighbourhood.The unspoken message of the film which screenwriter Iris Yamashita penned in concert with Flags scribe Paul Haggis is that war is a battle of competing symbols and ideologies that have no meaning. We create artificial divisions to hide the fact that we are all the same under the skin with the same hopes desires and fears.You may well find yourself cheering for the Japanese side and shuddering every time a U.S. Marine comes into the frame. The enemy of Flags largely unseen behind guns and armour suddenly becomes flesh-and-blood people who are simply fighting for their country and their own survival. Watanabes noble countenance and Ninomiyas genial smile reveal the depth of personality of a land often reduced to clumsy stereotypes.The difference between the Japanese and the Americans is that the former embrace suicide as a honourable alternative to dying in battle. There are disturbing scenes of soldiers and officers using grenades to quickly end their personal wars. But they arent given much choice since the Empire demands total fealty to the end. Kuribayashis request to HQ for additional troops and firepower prompts a telegram of stoic regret ""We earnestly hope you will fight honourably and die for your country"" it reads. The films aspect is every bit as bleak as was in Flags released last October. Tom Sterns camera is once again nearly drained of colour as it strains to find any signs of life amongst the most forbidding of terrain. Letters began almost as an afterthought when Eastwood realized that his adaptation of the best seller Flags of our Fathers couldnt comfortably accommodate the telling of both the American and Japanese sides of the story.Yet it is by far the greater achievement in every regard because it gets to the heart of what Eastwood was really trying to say all along War is what people engage in when they refuse to accept their common values.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Under the Sands of Iwo Jima washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Under the Sands of Iwo Jima Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 12 2007 ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is a necessary movie; too bad its not a great movie. The first major film made by an American -- Clint Eastwood -- to tell the story of the war in the Pacific from the Japanese point of view its most valuable as a massive correction. German soldiers have long since been readmitted to humanity since their participation in the great adventure in death known as World War II but for many reasons -- race is perhaps one of them; less insidiously so is timing -- that gesture has never been afforded the Japanese soldier. Since that December morning in 1941 the Japanese soldier has been viewed as a little bucktoothed four-eyed psycho of kamikaze Bushido. ""Letters"" changes all that. It starts and stops on ""sulphur island"" that flyspeck of volcanic ash so close to the mainland (760 miles) that its formally a part of the prefecture of Tokyo and where on Feb. 19 1945 two divisions of Marines came ashore in what would be one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The figures tell the story More than 6000 Americans and more than 21000 Japanese died in 35 days of fighting. There were about a thousand Japanese captured. Its that last one that conveys an image of fight-to-the-death pathology among the Japanese grunts. It was common for the hopelessly outnumbered and surrounded to say nothing of starved and sickened Japanese to commit suicide (the movie depicts horrifyingly the grenade as weapon of choice) rather than face the eternal shame of throwing their rifles down and raising their hands. But the movie makes the point over and over again that this self-extinction was enforced from above a brutal dictate of the Japanese warlord class who had taken over the government. The poor regular guys Their attitude toward pulling the pin and holding the little crenelated cylinder to their chests was no different than yours or mine as in No thanks Ill skip this grenade stuff if its all the same to you. The movie like Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" isnt really a history of a battle and it frankly could have used both a timeline and a few topographic indexes. Youll learn more who-went-where-when in five minutes on the Internet than you do in the exhausting 2 1/2 hours of this film. To Eastwood its mostly men in tunnels hoping they dont get killed today even if they know they will tomorrow. The films framing device is a modern-day excavation by Japanese archaeologists probing the now-deserted fortifications of Iwo in which a sack of mail undelivered is uncovered. The movie -- script by Iris Yamashita who was Paul Haggiss assistant during his writing of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" -- then uses the recovered letters as vessels by which to float through the last five months of preparations and battle. The view is kaleidoscopic from the commanding general and his staff to a group of draftees who keep asking ""Why me?"" even if they never get an answer. It helps enormously that the Japanese command staff on Iwo Jima was unusually colorful. The general in charge was Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Ken Watanabe) and like a cliche from a 40s war movie hed actually spent five years in the United States before the war and knew it well. Though a brilliantly educated military aristocrat he was by nature a writer and wrote dozens of letters from the island home many of which the movie quotes for their wit and humor. Still he was all soldier He devised the battle plans which involved massive fortification of heavy weapons and allowing the Marines to land and congregate on the beachhead and immediately inland before opening fire. After that the battle became a huge skirmish as small disconnected units of men hunted each other. The director depicts another colorful character Japanese Lt. Col. Baron Takeichi Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) also with American connections He won a gold medal in the 32 Los Angeles Olympics in a riding event and socialized with the Hollywood equestrian set. He likely knew more movie stars than any of the Americans invading the island But the more moving stories are those of the reluctant infantrymen. Though a few noncommissioned officers are portrayed with the samurai zeal to throw themselves before the treads of an American tank and blow it to smithereens with a mine clutched to their bosom the more common rank and file are just boys whod rather be somewhere else. Eastwood follows one squad assigned to one cave on Mount Suribachi. Our Everymen are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) and Shimizu (Ryo Kase) who have something Japanese infantrymen have never had in American movies pasts lives families kin hopes dreams desires and no particular hurry to die. When the volcano is overwhelmed in the early days of the battle and the Marines place their famous flag (the Japanese hardly notice) the few survivors among them Saigo and Shimizu try to scuttle in the only direction possible across Marine lines to the ever-dwindling Japanese positions at the other end of the island. This gives us a Cooks tour of hell as the young men just like those in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" scurry through a surrealistic warscape devoid of features and vegetation shooting and getting shot at. For a few larger tapestries ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" shares with ""Flags of Our Fathers"" the massive but convincing computer-generated invasion day spectacle with Marine Corsairs scudding over the hellish landscape to strafe and rocket the suspected Japanese positions. But mostly we are with the men in the caves. They almost never see Americans just as ""Flags of Our Fathers"" documented the truth that the Americans almost never saw the Japanese. In the last half-hour the story like the Japanese loses its way; lacking any clear-cut goals except survival the movie becomes repetitive. Unlike more narrative-driven movies (such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" with its imposed melodramatic structure of opening engagement building tension and final battle) the more experientially oriented ""Letters"" simply becomes an ordeal by confusion and bad luck. It also demonstrates the cruel whimsy of war No good deed goes unpunished and no bad one goes unrewarded. Prisoners are shot heroes looking to die gloriously are captured in their sleep moments of savage cruelty follow or precede moments of stunning tenderness. It shows what we all know and we always forget War is pretty much a terrible business. Letters From Iwo Jima (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extremely graphic battle carnage.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 22 2006 Save for later Saved Clint Eastwoods ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is his companion piece to ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and in almost every way is superior. That earlier movie had its powerful moments but it was entangled by its complicated time structure and its message - that patriotic propaganda is problematic even when fighting a ""just"" war - was tangled too.In ""Letters"" drawn from missives sent home by Japanese soldiers he shows us the same battle from the Japanese perspective and his intention is simpler He wants us to recognize the humanity of the enemy. In order to achieve the utmost verity he filmed the entire production using Japanese actors whose dialogue is subtitled in English.It is not entirely unprecedented for an American director to make a war movie from the perspective of the enemy - the most famous example is ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" But that movie was made from a pacifist stance whereas ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" never questions the rightness of the American cause. What it does do extremely well is humanize the Japanese soldiers as they make their last stand on Iwo Jima. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Unless you believe that enemy soldiers are altogether inhuman its difficult to argue with the films moral tone even as one recognizes the documented barbarism on the part of some Japanese in World War II. (The film shows a barbarous act by the Americans as well.) The focus here is on Iwo Jima not say Bataan. Why should it be shocking to insist on the humanity of these soldiers? Would it not be offensive for Eastwood to insist on its opposite? Wars are made by men not demons. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Unlike the bestial gung-ho Japanese who have been portrayed in the standard WWII drama the soldiers in this film are often scared - and rightly so. As the Americans bear down on the island it becomes clear to Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) that they will all end up as martyrs. His combat strategy of digging miles of tunnels greatly extended the time it took for the Americans to take the island but the Japanese defeat as depicted here always seems inevitable.Nor do the soldiers uniformly believe it is their duty to die with dignity. ""Theres nothing sacred about this island"" says one. ""The Americans can have it."" Eastwood working from a script by a first-time Japanese-American screenwriter Iris Yamashita shows a broad panorama of types from a fanatical officer (Shido Nakamura) who rebels against Kuribayashi to Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a baker who wants to live to see his newborn daughter and is as close to an everyman as this film provides. One character who straps a grenade to his chest and waits and waits in vain for the Americans to detonate him could have stepped right out of a Samuel Beckett play.The longings on the part of Saigo and Kuribayashi and others for their families is sometimes too blandly rendered in flashback. And perhaps too much ideological weight is placed on those longings. Love of family after all is not in itself a proof of goodness. (If it were some of the biggest butchers in history would be exempt from blame.) WWII movies were often padded with scenes of American soldiers reciting letters to sweethearts and dear old Mom and transposing that ploy to the Japanese side doesnt entirely eradicate its banality.But in its emotional simplicity and straightforward narrative punch ""Letters"" also harks back to what was best about those war movies. The fact that we are watching this battle from the enemys perspective represents not a moral capitulation but a widening of our awareness of what it is like to fight and die in a war - any war.

Starring Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 140 minutes. In Japanese with subtitles. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) It took less than 12 years after the conclusion of World War I for Hollywood to make ""All Quiet On the Western Front"" which showed the war as experienced by the enemy. But it has taken a full 61 years following World War II for ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" to arrive a superb Clint Eastwood film that depicts that battle from the Japanese perspective. Far superior to its companion piece ""Flags of Our Fathers"" released earlier this year ""Letters"" is a grim and humane film that has to be counted among the directors better efforts. That it has taken this long says something about the difference between the two world wars and the enemies America faced. World War I -- known then rather optimistically as ""The Great War"" -- was remembered almost immediately as a profound mistake while World War II has rightly gone down in history as a moral conflict. The atrocities committed by the Imperial Army against the Allies such as the Bataan Death March and POW camps that were little better than death factories have further made it impossible to look back on the war as anything resembling a misunderstanding. Eastwood recognizes this reality and in response he does something quite reasonable and mature in depicting the Japanese soldiers. He shows individual acts of courage and nobility and he presents the average soldiers as regular guys who wish they were somewhere else. But at the same time he doesnt shy from acknowledging in gentle but definite ways that there was something unwholesome in the culture of that army. This unwholesomeness which we in the West might describe as an authoritarian disregard for individual worth translates into Imperial officers terrorizing the populace. Theres an underlying sadism there and also a glorification of suicide as something not only to be chosen but to be forced on others. In this light it will be interesting to see how ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" plays to Japanese audiences as the films two protagonists -- General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and foot soldier Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) -- are hardly true believers and might not even be representative of the majority of their army. Theyre the harbingers of the modern men of courage who dont subscribe to the suicide cult. The general tells his men not to kill themselves but to kill the enemy and Saigo late in the film says he doesnt want to ""die for nothing."" He has a new baby he hasnt seen. He wants to go home. We see the lead-up to the battle in which the general arrives on the island and revamps the entire defense strategy. He halts the construction of trenches and has the soldiers build tunnels and machine-gun nests into the mountain overlooking the beach. In ""Flags of Our Fathers"" we saw how terrifying it was when the sleeping mountain came alive spouting machine-gun fire. In ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" we see how frightening it was to be on the inside of the mountain as bombs dropped and American soldiers swarmed. In one indelible moment an incendiary bomb comes through a crevice and a Japanese soldier is consumed in flames. It happens in an instant. In this film unlike other war films bombs dont just land nearby. They land on individuals. Eastwood uses a washed-out color palette so that the movie technically in color is virtually in black and white for most of the sequences. The film is long and bleak not the easiest of Eastwoods films to love but its authenticity and solemn purpose are unmistakable and Watanabe -- as a noble rational man presiding over the annihilation of his own army -- presents a complex character study. From the American standpoint the Japanese remained formidable for weeks. From the Japanese perspective the battle began as a foregone conclusion and it was just a matter of holding on for as long as possible in the face of superior force limited ammunition and the lack of food and water. At one point the Japanese are reduced to eating earthworms. Getting to see both sides of an event not juxtaposed in the same movie but presented separately with the audience given enough time to feel for the characters and inhabit their world is unusual. It might be unique and it serves a useful function quite apart from our understanding of that battle that war or even war in general. Movies are notorious for exploiting and reinforcing the viewers tendency to see everything through a subjective lens. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" shows us there are other ways to see. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence carnage and cruelty to animals.

In another film at another time American audiences would have thrilled to the sight of enemy troops scattering falling and dying on the ground below. In this film we are on the ground looking up through the eyes of those troops who see the Corsairs as the enemy. The reversal is unsettling to say the least and exactly as intended but then fascinating absorbing and deeply affecting. The release of ""Letters"" follows Mr. Eastwoods recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which dramatized Americas horrifically costly battle for the small Pacific island in World War II and the fates of the young men who planted the Stars and Stripes on the summit of Mount Suribachi. ""Letters"" can be seen as a companion piece -- a chronicle of the battle in Japanese with English subtitles from the Japanese point of view. In a larger sense though it is the second and artistically superior half of a single epic film that springs from a single stunning act of compassionate imagination. ENLARGE A scene from Clint Eastwoods Letters From Iwo Jima The pace is deliberate and the style is austere with bleached color photography (by Tom Stern) that could almost pass for black-and-white yet the feeling is intimate. This is a claustrophobic epic set mostly inside the elaborate network of caves and tunnels that the Japanese have dug in Iwo Jimas sandy hillsides. The Japanese soldiers arent depicted as anonymous Others but as men who might be but for their faces and uniforms -- and for their uncommon individuality -- the GIs and officers of American war movies. These fighting men like any others write letters to their mothers girlfriends and wives. Theyve been taught blind obedience to the emperor but their loyalty collides with their instinct for survival as they come to understand that theyre destined to die inside their caves. Some of the officers certainly qualify as fanatics but others who have lived in the U.S. and counted Americans as friends take a tragic view of their plight. They know they are doomed yet they fight furiously and heroically all the same. (As the islands commander Gen. Kuribayashi Ken Watanabe gives a performance thats commanding in every way -- taciturn fiery on occasion forthright yet self-effacing.) The view taken by Clint Eastwood directing from Iris Yamashitas exemplary screenplay is elegiac but -- and this is remarkable given the nature of the production and the sweep of his ambition -- not at all didactic. He lets the film speak for itself and so it does -- of humanity as well as primitive rage and horror on both sides of the battle. And the production as a whole ""Flags of Our Fathers"" together with ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" speaks more eloquently still -- of epic folly and shared tragedy of purblind imperatives and dire necessity. Just as usefully if not more so the two parts illuminate each other in intricate specific ways explaining why for instance a Japanese prisoner of war went berserk or what happened to a GI after he was taken captive. The sum of both parts is a war movie unlike any other.    Ya gotta do what ya gotta do as Rocky says in ""Rocky Balboa"" so I gotta admit that I had a pretty good time watching this 94th film in a series that started 30 years ago. The premise has the dual virtues of simplicity and preposterousness. Pushing 60 with a son who ignores him and not much to do but mourn the loss of his beloved wife Adrian Sylvester Stallones Italian Stallion lumbers back into the ring to do battle with the reigning world champion a monstrously bemuscled creature Mason ""The Line"" Dixon who is played by Antonio Tarver. ENLARGE Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as a boxing underdog in Rocky Balboa Why does he do it? Rocky has always been a champion of self-realization and hes at it again insisting on his right to be beaten to a bloody pulp by a 32-year-old. ""Whats crazy about standing toe to toe and saying I am?"" he asks rhetorically and Hemingwayesquely. How he gets to do it is another story -- the preposterous one -- that starts with a computer simulation pitting Dixon against Rocky in his prime. Soon Rocky is back in training accompanied by his old triumphal music. ""Rocky Balboa"" is without beating the point to a pulp erratically made. Various characters -- including Burt Youngs frazzled soul-sick Paulie -- suffer from seizures of speechifying. A subplot about a single mother and her son loses track of the boys reluctant bonding with Rocky and his son. Yet the mother played by Geraldine Hughes is an attractive foil for the battered ex-pug who tells charmingly repetitive tales of his exploits to diners at Adrians the neighborhood restaurant he owns. And you cant help being moved by the overlap between the indomitable boxer and the unquenchable actor. The same goes for the climactic bout some of which is shot in an ecstatic black-and-white style that evokes ""Raging Bull."" Against all odds this panoply of punishment is almost thrilling even though its raging bull of a different kind.    ""Venus"" is a love story in which one of the lovers -- the young Venus of the title -- first sees the much older man Maurice as an alien life form. She does recognize that hes alive however and she soon finds life in delightful abundance since the ardent old coot is played by Peter OToole. ENLARGE Peter OTooles Maurice is smitten with Jodie Whittakers Jessie in Venus. Hes wonderful in the role though fans of Mr. OToole who still think of him as the eerily beautiful Lawrence of Arabia may first be stunned to see him here sans makeup or vanity. His Maurice is an aging actor with a haunted visage a reedy voice a watery gaze a lurching gait and a precarious lease on life. Maurice may be short of breath but he is still long on longing. So hes instantly smitten -- besotted is a better word -- by the trashy grand-niece of his best friend Ian who arrives in London from the provinces to work as Ians caregiver. (Her name is Jessie though Maurice calls her Venus and shes played by a flagrantly talented newcomer named Jodie Whittaker.) The subtext of the film which Roger Michell directed from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi is mortality but the text is the jubilant dissonance between Maurice and Venus. He is fragile and terribly vulnerable though insistently self-ironic. She is vulgar insensitive and sometimes cruel. Still they blossom in each others presence and theyre not the only attractions either. Ian another creaky thespian is played by Leslie Phillips and Maurices ex-wife Valerie by Vanessa Redgrave. In other words ""Venus"" is awash in terrific performances.    In ""The Painted Veil"" which was directed by John Curran from a script by Ron Nyswaner terrific actors give glum performances. Edward Norton is Walter a middle-class English doctor who in 1920s London marries a mercurial upper-class beauty named Kitty (Naomi Watts) then takes her to China where he starts work as a bacteriologist and she quickly plunges into an affair. The generally brittle tone derives from the source material a novel by Somerset Maugham. (A movie of the same name starred Herbert Marshall and Greta Garbo in 1934 and was remade in 1957 as ""The Seventh Sin."") Still the particular brand of glumness is the result of choices I find truly mysterious. Why would the movies co-stars who were also its producers choose to play their unhappily married characters with such relentless dedication to repression and rigidity? They do open up toward the end but by then its too late for us to relate to anything but the scenery. The scenery is impressive -- first Shanghai in the mid-1920s then a remote Chinese village struck by a cholera epidemic. Yet its mainly a backdrop for long scenes of lacerating hostility between Walter who is punishing his wife with passive-aggressive silence while he struggles to stem the epidemic and Kitty who finds herself doing solitary penance with no evident hope of redemption. Im oversimplifying of course but not by much even though their situation finally changes if not entirely for the better. During those long stretches of emotional stasis the movie plays like ""No Love in the Time of Cholera.""    DVD tip ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) gave John Wayne one of his quintessential roles Sgt. John Stryker a tough-as-nails Marine turning raw recruits into fighting men. Though the film is very much a part of its time -- a time when a film like Clint Eastwoods was beyond imagining -- Wayne is at his most appealing and the use of combat footage is impressive. The flag-raising sequence includes three of the real-life flag raisers whose stories were at the center of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" Rene Gagnon Ira Hayes and John Bradley. --Read Mr. Morgensterns column every Friday in Weekend Journal Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Letter from Iwo Jima | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; letter-from-iwo-jima ) Letter from Iwo Jima (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Letters from Iwo Jima is a unique American-made war movie for at least two reasons it depicts the battle from the perspective of the losers and it represents the United States as the ""enemy."" Coupled with Flags of Our Fathers Letters from Iwo Jima provides director Clint Eastwoods complete statement about the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima. Although Flags of Our Fathers deals as much with how a photograph from the battle was used as propaganda on the home front as it does with the actual combat Letters from Iwo Jima remains entrenched upon the island from start to finish (except for a few character-building flashbacks). In terms of its structure this is more what we expect from a war movie than what Flags of Our Fathers offers. The only character common to both films is the islands rough terrain. The movie begins in late 1944 several months before the conflict with the arrival of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) on Iwo Jima. The Japanese realize this will likely be an American target and they dispatch the general to ready the defenses. To this end he re-deploys artillery from the beaches to the high ground and commissions a series of tunnels designed to protect from air attacks and connect various Japanese strong points. His tactics are scoffed at by some who see them as cowardly but applauded by others. As a counterpoint to the Generals perspective the movie provides the point-of-view of a common solider Saigo (pop star Kazunari Ninomiya) who plays a more important role in events than one might initially suppose. Although Eastwood does an adequate job of developing the characters into more than paper-thin soldiers this isnt a character-based piece and that limits its effectiveness. The movie fascinates because of the unusual rhythms it imparts to a familiar genre the war film. The Japanese for example do not in general believe in surrender so we know from the start that most of the people in this movie are going to be dead by the time the end credits roll. Instead of surrender the Japanese options include suicide attacks and blowing themselves up with grenades. Both occur during the course of the movie. This is dying with honor. For many watching the film the impulse will be to think ""what a waste."" Previous movies about Iwo Jima have presented the Japanese as a faceless implacable enemy. While they put up a stiff defense they are not as invulnerable as they have been portrayed to be. They are short on men food water and ammunition are rejected by the mainland when they request reinforcements and have no air cover. Much of their communications equipment is broken so in many cases the General has no way to reach his men in the field. Human messengers are unreliable; many never reach their destinations. The army is also rife with mutinous thoughts. Some sub-commanders thinking Kuribayashi to be weak and pro-American (he spent time in the United States and is friendly with some American officers) ignore his orders to fall back and instead commit suicidal frontal attacks. In the end the Japanese are almost wiped out but they take a surprisingly large number of Americans with them. To the degree that Iwo Jima is costly to the United States it is the result of Kuribayashis strategies. Had he not been hampered by poor communications and recalcitrant officers he might have done more damage. Eastwood makes some interesting stylistic choices. Most of the movie is shot in near black-and-white. Occasional muted flashes of color can be observed especially when there are explosions but for the most part the movie is monochromatic. This may be intended as an homage to older World War II movies or it may be an attempt at a pseudo-documentary approach. The battle sequences are effectively presented with good CGI and lots of explosions. Theres plenty of gore although the movie is less visceral than its companion piece. In Flags of Our Fathers Eastwood seems influenced by Saving Private Ryan. His approach to Letters from Iwo Jima is less bloody. (The black-and-white also defuses the impact of the viscera.) Actually the movies doesnt show a lot of detailed battle action; it stays with the characters many of whom dont see a lot of action. The only actor likely to be familiar to American audiences is Ken Watanabe who is perhaps best known from The Last Samurai. Watanabe exudes a calm confident aura - perfect for a general who understands he will not survive this mission and has made peace with that fact. He has a job to do and intends to do it to the best of his ability. Before leaving his wife he makes sure his affairs are in order. Oddly the thing that worries him the most is not dying on Iwo Jima but whether the kitchen floor will be finished. Watanabes performance places Kuribayashi in good company amidst a large group of brilliant effective cinematic generals whose on-screen portrayals dont overly exaggerate reality. Another performer worth singling out is Kazunari Ninomiya a popular Japanese singing star. Saigo is as far from the stereotype as any character in the film. American movies about World War II demonize the Germans and Japanese. Saigo however is just an ordinary guy who thinks the battles are pointless and wants to go home to be with his wife and newborn daughter. Ninomiyas performance brings out the human qualities of Saigo making viewers reflect about how powerless the pawns are in any war. Of the 100000 U.S. troops that participated in the battle of Iwo Jima nearly 7000 died and 20000 were injured. The Japanese defenders numbered around 20000 and only 1000 survived. Iwo Jima because of its timing and publicity value more than its strategic importance became one of the Pacific Theaters best known conflicts. With his two 2006 movies Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima Eastwood has stripped away some of the misconceptions about the battle and provided new perspectives. Taken together the films offer an imperfect but interesting interpretation of history. Of the two the more straightforward and better focused Letters from Iwo Jima is the stronger movie.

You can view it as a bookend to his recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or on its own. Either way its unprecedented a sorrowful and savagely beautiful elegy that can stand in the company of the greatest antiwar movies.Written in English which was then translated into Japanese by the young Japanese-American Iris Yamashita (who shares story credit with Paul Haggis) the screenplay brings to life four indelible characters all of whom know there is little chance theyll leave the island alive. General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) is the untraditional officer in charge who devised the 18 miles of tunnels that enabled the Japanese to withstand the American invasion for almost 40 days. He fights with the irony that having spent time in the United States before the war he reveres Americans. Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) is an irreverent young baker who just wants to stay alive to see his newborn daughter. The aristocratic Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is a famous equestrian who competed in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Private Shimizu (Ryo Kase) was trained in the elite military police but shipped off to Iwo Jima for disobeying orders to kill a dog. We see as well the old-guard officers who would shoot any soldier who tries to surrender and who when defeat seems inevitable order their men to die with honor by blowing themselves up with grenades. Eastwoods depiction of the horrors of war--and the atrocities committed on both sides--has a shocking intimacy.If ""Flags"" is more complex in its ambitions and structure the leaner simpler ""Letters"" is even more emotionally devastating. Superbly acted unblinking and unhysterical it looks beyond politics into the hearts and minds of the men called ""the enemy"" and lets us see ourselves.

The second installment in Clint Eastwoods ambitious and enterprising account of one of the Pacific wars most ferocious conflicts faces limited commercial prospects due to its Japanese-language dialogue alone. ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" represents something rare in the history of war movies -- a case of a filmmaker from one country sympathetically telling a combat story from the perspective of a former enemy. The second installment in Clint Eastwoods ambitious and enterprising account of one of the Pacific wars most ferocious conflicts the film is the stylistic twin of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" but different in feel due to its intimacy concentrated focus and inevitably the nature of its Japanese military characters. Well received at its premiere in Japan where it opens Dec. 9 this piercing astutely judged picture faces limited commercial prospects due to its Japanese-language dialogue alone. But after the more respectful than passionate critical response to ""Flags"" which has fallen short of B.O. expectations ""Letters"" may well fire Eastwoods many partisans with renewed vigor spelling sustained biz on select screens. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was about Germans in World War I but from a pacifist p.o.v.; ""Tora Tora Tora"" included the Japanese angle on Pearl Harbor; the central characters in ""The Blue Max"" and ""Cross of Iron"" were Germans. Scattered other examples certainly exist. All the same there are few moments in Hollywood cinema of any era as oddly unsettling as the one here in which an American Marine charges toward the protagonists and is so manifestly perceived as the enemy. That unfortunate young man is bayonetted to death by his Japanese captors. But the films true intent comes across the second time a Yank is nabbed by the doomed members of the Imperial Army when the injured grunt movingly establishes an unlikely bond with his aristocratic Japanese interrogator. There were compelling reasons why the war was fought but the unusual focus of ""Letters"" is the humanity of the Japanese soldiers who longed for home just like anyone else knowing they would never leave the tiny strip of land alive. Naturally U.S. war films of the era painted the Japanese as the most maniacal and barbaric of fighters and many veterans and historians Americans Chinese and others insist this was true. Pic might have done well to mention the emperors endorsement of the ""Death Before Surrender"" edict of early 1945. But ""Letters"" makes the case that even the Japanese were divided among themselves. ""Theres nothing sacred about this island"" says one heretical conscript. ""The Americans can have it."" The official line was that the invaders were weak-willed and undisciplined but two of the top Japanese officers depicted here had spent time in the U.S. before the war liked the country and had friends there. To echo the primary theme of ""Flags"" nothing is as clear-cut as it seems; the situation is never as black-and-white as any sides propaganda would have it.Considered from the Japanese angle Iwo Jima resembles the Alamo a futile if heroic last stand against an enemy force too overwhelming to withstand although withstand it they did for much longer than their opponents imagined possible. Elegantly but with dramatic bite Eastwood unfolds the story of some of the men who put up the resilient fight emphasizing the way their personalities were expressed through crisis rather than ideology or stock notions of bravery and heroics. Screenplay by first-timer Iris Yamashita a Japanese-American who worked out the story with ""Flags"" scenarist Paul Haggis maintains an intimate focus within a grand context and is based on sentiments expressed in long-dead soldiers letters seen at the outset being dug up on Iwo Jima. Initial stretch provides an opportunity to paint a more detailed portrait than ""Flags"" could of the desolation of the 5 mile by 21/2-mile strip of black volcanic rock and sand. In the wilting summer before the invasion the assembled Japanese troops were scraping by with no resources. Rescuing them from torpor and the savage punishments of severe officers is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) the impressive former chief of the Imperial Guard sent to prepare the island for the anticipated American assault. Within the limits of a tradition defined by loyalty and obedience Kuribayashi is his own man. Taking the measure of the inhospitable bit of real estate on extensive walks he undercuts by-the-book officers to their fury and soon has a weary ineffectual admiral sent home. Whereas the Japanese customarily believed in beachhead defenses the new general orders the construction of miles of tunnels and caves from which his 20000 men can most advantageously battle the arriving Americans. Kuribayashi quickly befriends the dashing Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) an aristocrat with a meager supply of Johnnie Walker. The shared scotch serves as a reminder of the America they both know personally; Kuribayashi was there as a student and young officer Nishi as an equestrian at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Their quiet moments to converse are privileged ones especially in light of what lies ahead. At the opposite end of the hierarchy are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a simple baker and mildly impudent everyman who longs only to see his infant daughter and the sensitive Shimizu (Ryo Kase) whose shortcomings as an MP have earned him this lamentable posting. With rabid exceptions the Japanese here are dedicated ready to kill the enemy and resigned to whatever their fates may be even as they may have mixed minds about fighting and mostly wish they were somewhere else. Their hideaways secure the men wait and wait some more. Suffering from centipedes a steady diet of weed soup and bad water one soldier quips ""Well be dead before the Americans get here."" And theres nothing but bad news from the outside world as their navy is wiped out and hoped-for reserves wont be arriving after all. Finally with the U.S. fleet on its way from Saipan Kuribayashi levels with his men They should not expect to survive but must each endeavor to kill at least 10 of the enemy before dying themselves. Battle commences an hour in and the generals tactics immediately prove their worth as the Americans sustain heavy losses as they swarm the beach. But in a particularly disturbing interlude in one cave a group of ultra-traditionalists decide to ""die with honor."" In due course Mount Suribachi is taken and this time Eastwood hauntingly offers the historic flag-raising from the Japanese perspective at the opposite end of the island. With troops separated in different locations a festering split in the Japanese command bursts and one particularly fanatical officer Lt. Ito (Shidou Nakamura) goes his own way in defiance of Kuribayashi. Deterioration of the Japanese position is slow but inevitable. An artiermore impressionistic approach might have emphasized the unbearable psychological pressure induced by prolonged confinement deprivation and bombardment. The claustrophobic element is obviously mandatory but Eastwood allows the film to breathe by moving the action around in space and time combined with the engaging characters who occupy centerstage. A man of his time but with a refinement that suggests an earlier era Kuribayashi is the sort of man any army would want to have in charge. In Watanabes beautifully nuanced performance he is smart cunning and imaginative always several steps ahead in his thinking and therefore never ruffled. His composure in the face of certain doom is remarkable his fate an expression of both his love of country and his broader sense of himself as a man of honor and arms. Ihara is a treat as the bon vivant whose sense of style isnt impaired even by hell on earth while Kazunari offers a lively easily accessible commoner whose emotions are simple and direct. Due partly to the preponderance of dark interiors ""Letters"" seems even more like a black-and-white film than did ""Flags"" the color in Tom Sterns strongly composed lensing drained nearly to the vanishing point. One panoramic shot of the American fleet aside CGI work seems minimal here as a bit of location footage from the island itself has b een discreetly amplified by stand-in landscapes shot in California with a little work in Japan to top it off. The superbly varied interiors represent the final work of the late great production designer Henry Bumstead along with James J. Murakami. Regular Eastwood editor Joel Cox was here partnered with Gary D. Roach. Spare score this time was composed not by the director but by son Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens. Possibly the one thing missing from this microcosmic look at an epochal battle is the bigger picture a sense of the staggering slaughter that took place over a six-week period at a cost of 26000 lives. ""Flags"" imparted something of an idea of this although not in its totality and certainly not for the Japanese of whom only 216 survived. Taken together ""Flags"" and ""Letters"" represent a genuinely imposing achievement one that looks at war unflinchingly -- that does not deny its necessity but above all laments the human loss it entails.
