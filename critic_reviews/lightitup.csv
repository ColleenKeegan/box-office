(forget textbooks - the place doesnt have heat) a noble and beloved teacher played by former delinquent role model Judd Nelson is unjustly suspended touching off a skirmish that escalates into a violent student sit-in. Usher Raymond the squinty pop star plays Lester leader of the disaffected rebels. As an actor Raymond is whiny and annoying but not nearly so much as the film which wants to be ""Dog Day Afternoon"" meets ""The Breakfast Club"" and would have been excruciating even if it had succeeded. Shot in a doomy glossy style that transforms inner-city school corridors into hallways of lost destiny Light It Up is one of those jaw-droppingly bogus up-against-the-system message movies in which crowds of angry student protesters gather outside the school with placards that read ""Free the Lincoln 6."" Lester staring at the officer (Forest Whitaker) who has been shot in the leg and taken hostage delivers the coup de grace when he says ""The first 10 minutes you made up in your mind who we were"" Actually the film made up its mind in the first 10 seconds.

Writer-director Craig Bolotins second feature can be classified as a middle-brow item among 90s urban-set movies -- not nearly as thoughtful as ""Fresh"" not as harshly obvious and emphatic as ""Boyz N the Hood"" or ""187."" A cautionary high school fable borrowing more from traditional Hollywood than hip-hop sensibilities ""Light It Up"" never quite catches fire in its too-deliberate attempt to appeal to all ages and all tastes. Writer-director Craig Bolotins second feature six years after his teen-oriented debut ""That Night"" can be classified as a middle-brow item among 90s urban-set movies -- not nearly as thoughtful as ""Fresh"" not as harshly obvious and emphatic as ""Boyz N the Hood"" or ""187."" This drama of teen angst driven by the formula of a hostage actioner should receive a strong response in urban markets thanks to its tendency not to talk down to its young target aud as well as for the presence of major hip-hop stars like Usher Raymond and Fredro Starr. Good grades also await down the line in video. Story unfolds in a continuous sequence of incidents as popular teacher Ken Knowles (Judd Nelson now grown up enough from ""Breakfast Club"" days to be the mentor) tries to teach his media class in budget-starved Lincoln High School in Queens while the harsh winter winds blow a hole in the classroom window. Unable to find suitable space on the overcrowded campus Knowles takes his class to the local diner which is promptly held up by a hooded gunman whom the teacher recognizes as a former student. Knowles knocks out the gunman but what his pupils see as an act of bravery is viewed by pugnacious principal Armstrong (Glynn Turman) as grounds for probationary leave. This is final straw for everyone from potential valedictorian Stephanie (Rosario Dawson) to alienated ex-hoops star Lester (Raymond) and his baby-faced artist sidekick Ziggy (Robert Richard). Lester rapidly ends up in an accidental shooting confrontation with NYPD officer Jackson (Forest Whitaker) whos been on leave from the street beat to serve as hall monitor. Things spin out of control as Lester takes Jackson hostage with his dizzied classmates holing up with him in the school library while the remaining students flee the school. Once ""Light It Up"" shifts gears into hostage pic mode 30 minutes in usual problems of this genre appear. As much as Bolotin tries to avoid cliches he cant setting up Jackson as a mind-playing hostage who tries to manipulate gullible kids while aggressive Rodney (Starr) presses his gang-banging tactics against Lesters more patient approach. Whitakers role here recalls his British soldier held hostage in ""The Crying Game"" and its this thesps presence that keeps the schoolhouse antics from collapsing into preachy nonsense. Potentially stagy situation is broken up by several factors including entry of hostage negotiator Audrey McDonald (Vanessa L. Williams) followed by revelation of Ziggys wounds at the hands of his abusive father TV reports depicting the kids as thugs and Stephanie directing peers to list their demands for school improvements over the Internet. Sentiments soon shift toward the hostage-takers as a crowd forms calling to ""Free the Lincoln Six."" Still the events media impact on the general public is barely explored thus depriving pic of considerable impact as a broader social drama. Belated background story details play crudely and melodramatically as does an overly operatic denouement fulfilling Ziggys role as the tragically martyred artist. Young ensemble may be enacting a demographically and politically correct assemblage of high school types but seldom overplay their hand. Tyro thesp Raymond keeps it together as Lester ably projecting the young mans internal conflicts. While Starr is stuck with having to play the bad dude he doesnt embarrass himself though the usually reliable Gilbert nearly does as lonely and pregnant Lynn. Importantly we can see a brain working inside the calmly effective Dawson and Richard is all boyish innocence. As Rivers the schools wheeler-dealer Clifton Collins Jr. suffers from not having enough to play with. Whitakers hostage is the only interesting adult. While avoiding the pitfalls of exploitative inner-city thrillers ""Light It Up"" tries too hard to appeal to both kids who know and grown-ups who dont get it deliberately softening potential violence while striving for some obvious messages about need for public schools to be upgraded and students to be heard from. Even the hip-hop angle is curiously subdued given presence of co-producer Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds presumably to attract a broader crowd. These manipulations become more conspicuous as pics tension lags and cliches rise to the foreground making ""Light It Up"" feel more like an entertainment package than an authentic story from the streets. Wintry atmospherics highlight production elements which are especially good in designer Lawrence G. Paulls creation of a beaten-down decaying school. Lensing is fair while mainstream Hollywoods penchant for excessive amount of soundtrack music continues with Harry Gregson-Williams score.

(forget textbooks--the place doesnt have heat)...1999-11-19 F Light It Up Genre Drama; Starring Judd Nelson Usher; Director Craig Bolotin; MPAA Rating R Posted November 19 1999 -- 1200 AM EST At Lincoln High School a crumbling impoverished institution deep in the heart of Queens N.Y. (forget textbooks--the place doesnt have heat) a noble and beloved teacher played by former delinquent role model Judd Nelson is unjustly suspended touching off a skirmish that escalates into a violent student sit-in. Usher Raymond the squinty pop star plays Lester leader of the disaffected rebels. As an actor Raymond is whiny and annoying but not nearly so much as the film which wants to be Dog Day Afternoon meets The Breakfast Club and would have been excruciating even if it had succeeded. Shot in a doomy glossy style that transforms inner-city school corridors into hallways of lost destiny Light It Up is one of those jaw-droppingly bogus up-against-the-system message movies in which crowds of angry student protesters gather outside the school with placards that read ""Free the Lincoln 6."" Lester staring at the officer (Forest Whitaker) who has been shot in the leg and taken hostage delivers the coup de grace when he says ""The first 10 minutes you made up in your mind who we were"" Actually the film made up its mind in the first 10 seconds.

This tale of a half-dozen students who take over their Queens high school after the accidental shooting of a police officer and turn their occupation into a plea for better education school repairs and decent treatment smacks more of by-the-numbers marketing creation than artistic inspiration. While the more recent antecedents of Light It Up appear to be films like The Breakfast Club (1985) and Cooley High (1975) the true lineage probably tracks back to the World War II films that constructed their drama around the diverse members of a military squad right down to the sensitive artist who might achieve greatness if only he can survive the impending battle. In this case the enemy pitted against a handful of black white and Hispanic children with a wounded policeman as their hostage is a horde of heavily armed police officers and television news broadcasters rendering one-sided accounts of the takeover until the students use modern electronics to issue their side of the story to the public. As written and directed by Craig Bolotin whose credits include Black Rain and That Night Light It Up is one of those films that underscore their claim to importance with intrusive music and blurry scenes in a shade of blue rarely seen in real life. As for the action it spins out of a morning gone wrong at Lincoln High where there are too many students too few textbooks too little heat and a principal (Glynn Turman an alumnus of Cooley High) who is unresponsive even to Ken Knowles the most caring of his teachers (Judd Nelson an alumnus of The Breakfast Club). To compound matters the new arrival in school is a hulking police officer (Forest Whitaker) of monumental insensitivity and a determination to make his presence felt at once. He has already had an encounter with two of the students -- the troubled basketball star Lester Dewitt (Usher Raymond) and Ziggy Malone (Robert Richard ) the abused pint-size Michelangelo of the Lincoln High cockloft by the time Mr. Knowles and his students are forced to abandon their classroom. The impatient principal instructs Knowles to take his class anywhere but the hallway and when they adjourn to a nearby luncheonette an attempted armed robbery subjects Knowles to suspension for taking his charges off the school premises. When the students including the good intelligent Stephanie Williams (Rosario Dawson) rally to his defense matters get out of hand the policeman is wounded in a scuffle involving Lester and Ziggy and the takeover begins. Vanessa L. Williams plays the role of a police negotiator eager to end the standoff without violence who is pitted against yet another of the films one-dimensional characters a police lieutenant eager to send his SWAT team into action. By its end Light It Up has become a film whose soft heart lies crushed under its heavy hand. Light It Up is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence and street language. LIGHT IT UP Written and directed by Craig Bolotin; director of photography Elliot Davis; edited by Wendy Greene Bricmont; music by Harry Gregson-Williams; production designer Lawrence G. Paull; produced by Tracey E. Edmonds; released by Fox 2000. Running time 98 minutes. This film is rated R.

Starring Usher Raymond Forest Whitaker Judd Nelson and Vanessa L. Williams. Directed by Craig Bolotin. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A deluge of movies is set to be released in the next three weeks. One that should not be lost in the flood is ""Light It Up"" an urban drama that opens today. Written and directed by Craig Bolotin the picture tells the story of an uprising at an inner-city high school. Steering clear of the usual traps it loses itself neither to gangsta bluster nor sentimentality. It stays focused The movie is about kids. The calamity is on a human scale. At all times the audience believes that its watching something that really could happen. The problem with other movies set in the inner city is that the kids are all painted with the same brush. ""Light It Up"" presents us with a disparate group thrown together by circumstance. Judd Nelson former Brat Packer plays Mr. Knowles a popular social studies teacher. Though he doesnt have much screen time Nelson embodies that special something that good teachers have -- authority without hostility caring without corniness. He is from the adult world and doesnt pretend otherwise but he is comfortable around kids. The teacher has to deal with VCRs that dont work a lack of textbooks and an unheated classroom in the dead of winter. A minor incident leads to his suspension and events snowball from there. A group of kids confronts the principal beautifully played by Glynn Turman as a slick obnoxious character -- flashy dapper and deceitful. The audience cant wait for him to get his comeuppance but ""Light It Up"" is too good a movie to give the audience everything it wants. The first 20 minutes of ""Light It Up"" is just a preamble to the rest of the film which could be called a hostage drama. The principal arrogantly suspends a handful of good students who dare to question him and the situation escalates. Hip-hop star Usher Raymond plays Lester a good student who comes to the defense of a friend and ends up holding a gun and pointing it at a cop played by Forest Whitaker. The students flee the school except for a half dozen including Ro sario Dawson as a beautiful honors student and Fredro Starr another hip-hop star who is genuinely scary as a gang member who cant wait to get his hands on Lesters gun. Vanessa L. Williams in a role played almost entirely on the phone is a hostage negotiator. In ""Light It Up"" the adults in power dont want to listen and dont want to know anything. They want to make assumptions and impose their authority. The movie suggests that its a lack of not only compassion but basic interest as well that leads to catastrophe. ..
