"Review The Lovely Bones - CNN.com Part of complete coverage on Academy Awards Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review The Lovely BonesBy Lisa Schwarzbaum Entertainment Weekly Saoirse Ronan is the lead in Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSScreen adaptation of Alice Sebolds striking novelReaders will be frustrated while newcomers to the story may be confusedIn Jacksons simplified telling ""The Lovely Bones"" is intentionally made less upsetting for teens RELATED TOPICS Peter Jackson Movie Reviews Movies (Entertainment Weekly) -- A dead 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) murdered on her way home from school in 1973 tells her story from heaven in ""The Lovely Bones."" In doing so Susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by Alice Sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson is based. But as directed by the lord of ""The Lord of the Rings"" from a screenplay by Jackson Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens his bleached ""Bones"" bears little resemblance to the book in either tone or complexity. Readers will be frustrated; newcomers to the story may wonder why what is now essentially a serial-killer thriller includes so many scenes of a heaven that looks like a gumdrop-colored hobbit shire a magical place of fanciful special effects. In Jacksons simplified sweetened and CGI-besotted telling ""The Lovely Bones"" is a sad-but-hopeful dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens. (Theres no indication that Susie gets raped as she does in the novel and her murder occurs off screen.) ""Atonements"" terrific Ronan with her astonishing glacier-blue eyes watches from a scenic afterlife as her father (Mark Wahlberg) mother (Rachel Weisz) younger siblings and selected friends simultaneously heal from their loss and search for her killer. For comic relief the familys boozy granny (Susan Sarandon) arrives swathed in mink. Apparently participating in a burlesque movie Sarandon camps it up demonstrating terrible housekeeping skills and wreaking grande-dame havoc. As for the killer hes in plain sight from the beginning a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) with the hopeless comb-over and furtive mustache of an easy-to-spot perv. Tucci is jolting in the role honestly unsettling as he maintains an exterior of mildness that masks a grotesque interior. Electrifying danger accompanies his every scene. But this in itself becomes a problem as that same energy leaves the screen when he does. Jackson reduces his ""Lovely Bones"" in the end to the dramatic contrast between the menace of a hateful killer (will he be caught?) and the grief of a loving father (can he avenge his daughters death?). Sebolds ""Lovely Bones"" on the other hand is fleshed out with the perilous irresistible power of sex the author acknowledges a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded. The filmmaker handled the sexual power of girls beautifully in 1994s ""Heavenly Creatures"". But here he shies from the challenge shortchanging a story that isnt only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth. Jackson forfeits depth for safe surface loveliness. EW Grade C+CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly (c) 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Lost in translation the book casts a spell the movie kills it Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 14 2010 108PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Lovely Bones Directed by Peter Jackson Written by Peter Jackson Fran Walsh Philippa Boyens Starring Saoirse Ronan Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Classification PG Some books should stay between their covers and The Lovely Bones may well be one of them. The novel succeeds because its brutal conceit - the narrator is a murdered girl looking down at the world she left behind - is delicately rendered as the filigree of Alice Sebolds prose combines with the readers liberated imagination to weave a compelling spell. But remove that filigree then incarcerate our imagination inside a confining frame filled with heavy-handed visuals and the spell is gone. The book floats sublimely above its dark theme; the movie sinks into the ridiculous. Not at the start though where the establishing scenes are forebodingly taut. When we first meet Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) shes alive and well and a sprightly teen happily ensconced in a small Pennsylvania town and the loving embrace of her family. Mom (Rachel Weisz) knits snugly tuques Dad (Mark Wahlberg) builds ships in a bottle younger siblings caper and cavort - its the early seventies and the future seems as securely fixed and as bright as the Snoopy poster on her bedroom wall. But then in Susies matter-of-fact voice-over a different outcome is foretold ""I was 14 years old when I was murdered. ... My murderer was a man from my neighbourhood."" To capture her altered future director Peter Jackson forages through his own past sidestepping that little Lord of the Rings detour and heading back to the technique a mix of hard realism and fantasy that marked his early work in Heavenly Creatures . There the mix fused nicely; here it doesnt and the competing ingredients work neither separately nor together. His method is to consistently crosscut between the two worlds beginning with the murder itself when the girl meets her fate in a wintry cornfield while sitting at their cozy kitchen table her oblivious family chats merrily away. Of course given that we already know the horrid result the sequence lacks suspense although the creepy quotient is definitely high courtesy of Stanley Tuccis take on the villain. With his hair blond his eyes blue and his spectacles glaring Tucci does a credible job animating the cliche of the serial killer as quietly respectable citizen injecting the venom of brutality into the bland. From that point Susie is off to her ""in between"" realm somewhere in the blue yonder physically removed from yet still viscerally engaged with the earthly doings beneath. So the crosscutting continues only now were on an alternating shuttle from the supernatural to the natural. Up above Jackson digs deep into his bag of computer-generated tricks but the effects just aint effective. The poor girls halfway house seems stuck in its own surreal limbo unsure whether its a bad knock-off of a Dali painting or a pretty fair imitation of a Coke commercial. Meanwhile down in terra firma the film is suffering a similar identity crisis squirming about from murder tale to sensitive drama to horror flick to surprise situation comedy. The sad dad (although Wahlbergs revealed limitations are sadder still) is getting obsessed with the case; an investigating cop is getting suspicious of the not-so-good neighbour; Susies sister is getting dangerously close to falling into the same predatory trap; and Susan Sarandon is just getting silly. She plays the comic granny who whisky glass in one hand and cigarette in the other pops up to ""take charge"" of the fractured household preaching the gospel of getting-on-with-life from the pulpit of her purple haze. Its like granny wandered in from a failed pilot on the Fox network. Well in this life and beyond thats a lot of oddballs to juggle and every one of them is dropped with a thud then swept away in a climax that unfolds with unseemly haste. By now all the crosscutting has begun to look like a messy collision that forces us into the role of rubbernecker gawking at the unlucky participants - the one above in her near-heaven the others below in their living hell - but not feeling a damn thing. And since raw feeling poignantly invested in the transcendent voice of a child victim who grieves for the survivors is the overriding virtue of the novel the overriding vice of the film is easy to find. And easier to condemn. Compressed onto the screen the bones are twisted out of shape deprived of their emotional weight no longer lovely. What has spread is the villainy and with it the killing field - inevitably so when the movie murders the book.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A table is set. A laboriously devised trap is sprung. As dinner is served a bottle of soda is pushed on an increasingly nervous teenager. Mom Dad and younger siblings toss off tart comments about the tardiness of a family member. In a field a neighbors creepiness turns to violence. This montage in Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"" is as potent as any in a film about the ways brutality upends our precious everyday routines. Jackson displays a deft grasp of the dismaying parallel universes of the ordinary and pathological. And much of his adaptation of Alice Sebolds best-selling novel -- co-written with long-time collaborators life-partner Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens -- beautifully splices the utterly familiar with the shattering. Yet something central to Sebolds raw and elegant tale remains elusive. Few movies make one re-evaluate a novels power. (Was it really all that?) This one nearly did. As lovingly crafted as ""The Lovely Bones"" is the film left us wondering Why isnt it a more tragic and transcendent experience? While parents Jack and Abigail Salmon(Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) sit down in their nice suburban house their oldest child meets her end in a field. If you know Sebolds novel of afterlife reckoning and consolation this is hardly a spoiler. After all the early sentences of Chapter One are ""My name is Salmon like the fish. Susie Salmon. I was 14 when I was murdered "" When Susie utters these words in the movie she joins filmdoms memorable dead narrators Joe Gillis of ""Sunset Blvd."" ""American Beautys"" Lester Burnham. Saoirse Ronan (the bad seed in ""Atonement"") makes Susie a believably touching mix of innocence and intelligence. Her voice-over compels. Bright hopeful Susie is plunging into her first deep crush when shes uprooted by Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Reece Ritchie of the long lashes and soft British accent plays Ray Singh. Hes a gentle hottie for sensitive girls everywhere. Set in 1973 before milk cartons carried missing childrens photos and long before AMBER alerts Susies disappearance and evidence of foul play leaves a maw deeper than the sinkhole her small town uses as the local dump. Susies young brother feels his dead sisters presence. From her perch in the hereafter Susie watches along with her ally Holly (Nikki Soohoo) as sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) grows up but also becomes dangerously suspicious of Harvey. Everyone is affected by Susies disappearance. Not just her family but also her community Ray; Ruth the goth outcast who feels dead people (Carolyn Dando in a quietly evocative turn); and Detective Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) whose doggedness evolves into a relationship with Abigail that is more fully noted in the book. While Weisz is underutilized as Abigail Wahlberg is a spot-on choice as the loving grieving unrelenting dad. His voice is capable of a whispered hope a muted whine a rising hysteria all present in Jacks unfathomable grief. The movie is often wise. Obsessiveness and peculiar hobbies alone do not make a child murderer. Susie offers insights that rebuff easy judgments. Some will find Harveys dollhouse construction proof of something more than unseemly. But is it any weirder than Jacks painstaking fascination with building tiny ships in bottles? Still Susie has an acute understanding of her unpunished killer. Tuccis turn is appropriately infuriating. To a chilling comb-over and gold-framed glasses the likable actor adds an unsettling hemming and hawing come-on that we adults like to believe we would recognize from a mile away as manipulative. His brutality is jarring. Though not exceptionally graphic parents should think seriously about sending their teens to this PG-13 film without an accompanying adult. The cautionary lessons offered to youngsters especially daughters demand conversation. ""THE LOVELY BONES."" PG-13 for mature thematic material involving disturbing violent content and images and some language. 2 hours 12 minutes.

An adolescent girl has been murdered by a reclusive neighborhood nut leaving her to look down upon her family from a rest stop just short of heaven. Should be incredibly moving no? But there I sat a guy with an embarrassing penchant for crying at movies dry-eyed and cold as a fish. Movie Information The Lovely BonesRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Peter JacksonActors Saoirse Ronan Stanley Tucci Mark Wahlberg Rachel Weisz and Michael ImperioliRun time 135 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (violence language)Synopsis Peter Jackson tackles Alice Sebolds best-seller narrated by a young girl who has been raped and murdered. Saoirse Ronan stars.More movies from GuideLive.comThe bad news for you is that I dont think its me. The Lovely Bones is a technically accomplished piece of work with passages of dazzling lyrical imagery. But it never really makes the necessary connections - between its earthly and near-celestial settings between murder victim and mourning loved ones between images and emotions. This is a distractingly busy movie so in love with its own considerable craft that it cant stay still long enough for anything to settle in.The year is 1973 the place Norristown Pa. All is well in the Salmon family so well that something bad has to happen. Sure enough Susie (Saoirse Ronan) is lured to her death by a bad neighbor (Stanley Tucci channeling Dustin Hoffman). After an ethereal horror-movie sequence of diffuse light and neither-dead-nor-aliveness she arrives for narrating duties in a place between heaven and earth. If youve ever wondered what this place looks like try to imagine a collection of exceptionally pretty screensavers where leaves take wing and fly away and beatific murder victims frolic and play.This is where the story begins in earnest; its also where The Lovely Bones runs out of juice far too early in the game. Susie observes the comings and goings of her parents (Mark Wahlberg overmatched by Rachel Weisz) little sister (Rose McIver) and murderer. Susan Sarandon wanders in from another movie as Susies boozy grandmother. The Lovely Bones struggles to decide what it wants to be when it grows up. Family drama? Supernatural take on the endurance of love? Creepy psycho-neighbor horror film? Police procedural (Michael ""Christuphuh"" Imperioli pitches in a police detective)? The Lovely Bones wants to be everywhere at once; as a result it ends up going nowhere in particular.To be fair its never easy for a movie to operate on parallel planes of existence. But it can be done. Actually Jackson has already done it. In 1994s Heavenly Creatures he created seamless transitions between the feverish passions of two adolescent New Zealand girls (Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) and the Claymation ""fourth world"" where their imaginations lead them. Heavenly Creatures never looks as fancy as The Lovely Bones but it flows and it hits hard.Bones by comparison is soft squishy and uncertain as if its too awestruck by its source material to stand on its own. Susies voice gets lost in the muddle. She deserves better.

Its the limbo-like world that is neither Earth nor heaven where she watches her parents mourn her sister grow up and her killer cover his tracks.Based on Alice Sebolds heartbreaking 2002 novel the screenplay is written by Jackson Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens who brought three The Lord of the Rings movies to the screen. In part it works but its far from a perfect film. Jacksons grand computer-generated vision of Susies Dali-like ""in between"" while occasionally gorgeous leaves the viewer feeling stuck between two worlds too. The story suffers.Saoirse (SUR-shuh) Ronan excels as Susie wide-eyed funny and innocent yet fierce and furious when she suddenly realizes that she been killed by the creepily ordinary man next door George Harvey (typically excellent Stanley Tucci).An Oscar nominee for Atonement in 2008 Ronan is perfect as the engaging girl with the luminous pale blue eyes who acts as both star and narrator.We meet Susie and her family as they go about their average lives in 1973 Pennsylvania dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and little brother Buckley. Brian Eno sets the aural scene as much as polyester and bell-bottoms establish the visual.Susie helps her dad build his beloved model ships-in-a-bottle but she has a new hobby of her own - photography (shes so enthusiastic her parents have to ration her film; developing is expensive). And shes smitten with a boy at school someone she thinks shed like to kiss.When Susie goes missing her parents are thrown into the panic-stricken state of coping with a lost child while murdered Susie watches and narrates from her otherworldly perch. Her presence is sometimes felt among the living.While her dad becomes obsessed with finding her killer characters randomly disappear and show up as the story veers off in unexplained ways. Frequently we are yanked back to the ""in between.""Susan Sarandon sashays in as Grandma Lynn looking like Jacqueline Susann on a weekend bender ice cubes tinkling in her glass and cigarette ashes flying. It may be an attempt to lighten proceedings but its an awkward fit.When ""the in between"" works it does so with heart-wrenching clarity. A scene of massive ships-in-a-bottle smashing into a rocky shore the glass splintering before the boats collapse wordlessly explains a fathers anguish. Its these moments when The Lovely Bones shows what is at the heart of the story the pain of loss and the difficult acceptance that life goes on in the aftermath.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review The Lovely Bones is hugely disappointing - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview The Lovely Bones is hugely disappointingBy Randy Myersrmyersbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 01/15/2010 120000 AM PSTUpdated 01/15/2010 060337 PM PSTClick photo to enlargeOscar nominee Saoirse Ronan stars as Susie Salmon in DreamWorks Pictures drama ""The Lovely Bones"" a Paramount Pictures release. (Dreamworks Studios) <<123>>In the disappointing adaptation of ""The Lovely Bones"" director Peter Jackson runs wild with the CGI a ludicrous decision that sucks the emotion out of Alice Sebolds intimate novel. Perhaps the bigger issue though is the novel itself. Sebolds unforgettable story while mesmerizing on the page defies being turned into a movie. Those familiar with the 2002 bestseller understand the challenge A tender approach is mandatory when handling ""Bones"" specifically since the lead character of Susie is a dead 14-year-old who has been raped and murdered by a neighbor. Subtlety as we know isnt exactly Jacksons strong suit although the New Zealand director deserves kudos for avoiding any graphic depictions of the crimes. But parents be warned This movie is not for children. More movie news reviews <a href=""http//scripts.bayareanewsgroup.com/scripts/feed2js/feed2js.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.contracostatimes.com%2Fmngi%2Frss%2FCustomRssServlet%2F571%2F201110.xmlamp;num=10amp;del=yamp;rel=yamp;html=y"">View RSS feed</a> Normally Jackson is up for any challenge; look at how spectacularly he brought to life J.R.R. Tolkiens daunting trilogy. But ""Lovely Bones"" isnt about hobbits or long-winded battles or an ape with an unfortunate crush. It hones in not on the shiny exterior but the emotional interior and sadly Jackson never manages to stir our souls.Like ""Heavenly Creatures"" Jacksons much better 1994 film ""The Lovely Bones"" at times transports us to a Dali-like existence -- a go-between place where the surreal things are. The head-tripping sequences in ""Creatures"" were effective since the fantasy world added dimension to the characters. In ""Bones"" the heavenly spot Susie finds herself in is mostly unfulfilling eye candy with the exception of a stunning CGI effect that has gargantuan ships in bottles crashing into the shore. Most often Jacksons magical other world resembles the land of Oz on steroids or in one scene a feminine hygiene ad.Advertisement Jackson is most at home when venturing into the creepy and suspenseful no surprise since he built his career from the horror genre. Thats especially apparent when Susie Salmon (""Atonements"" perfectly good Saoirse Ronan) fatally enters the underground lair of killer George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). These moments along with any other featuring Tucci are the films strongest. But just as ""Bones"" isnt a standard serial killer flick it also shouldnt be a comedy. When Susan Sarandon prances onto the scene with cigarette dangling from painted lips and sporting a bee-hived do the film shifts tone so uncomfortably you swear theyve spliced in a screwball moment from a Sandra Bullock romance. Its always a pleasure to see Sarandon chew up the scenery especially as a grandma with attitude but this fine actress belongs in another film.As does Mark Wahlberg who is way out of his league playing a devastated dad in search of his daughters killer. Hes terribly bland going through the motions without an iota of depth. It makes you wonder if his strong performances in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""The Departed"" were flukes.Tucci on the other hand fearlessly taps into the frightening mindset of a killer. His creepy characters sweaty tics are absolutely unnerving in yet another remarkable performance that demonstrates his incredible versatility. Its hard to imagine that this is the same actor who charmed us thoroughly in ""Julie amp; Julia"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada."" What a shame then that this performance one of the years best will likely be ignored come Oscar time.But dont feel too sorry for Tucci. More accolades and hopefully an Oscar will arrive one day as they likely will again for Jackson who has other projects in development. One can only hope that whatever the talented director tackles next it will be better suited for his desire for the spectacle. If not audiences will have a bone to pick with him.""The Lovely Bones""Rating PG-13 (for mature thematic material involving disturbing violent content and images and some language)Cast Saoirse Ronan Mark Wahlberg Rachel Weisz Stanley Tucci and Susan SarandonDirector Peter JacksonWriters Jackson Fran Walsh and Philippa BoyensRunning time 2 hours 19 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Starring Mark Wahlberg Rachel Weisz Susan Sarandon Stanley Tucci Saoirse Ronan Michael Imperioli Amanda Michalka Nikki SooHoo Rose McIver Carolyn Dando Director Peter Jackson Running time 210 Release Opened Jan 15 2010  Editorial Review Sadly stuck in limboBy Ann HornadayFriday Jan. 15 2010""The Lovely Bones"" is anything but. Peter Jacksons movie based on the best-selling Alice Sebold novel flagrantly disobeys the first law of adaptation and indeed of filmmaking in general Get the tone right. And tone is the first thing sacrificed in this shapeless overlong mawkishly muddled pop-up illustration of a movie.Part coming-of-age movie part domestic melodrama part thriller and part magical realist meditation on death ""The Lovely Bones"" reaches desperately for style -- inspired by everything from ""Twilight"" and ""The Teletubbies"" to bad 1970s van art -- and in the process drops all pretense of substance. It leaves audiences in a limbo every bit as torturous as the one the protagonist is in.That protagonist is Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) who in a voice-over narration explains that she was murdered in 1973 at age 14 by a neighbor. Although Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"") is far too canny a showman to miss a chance for gruesome exploitation an impulse he indulges in agonizing sequences just before and just after the crime most of ""The Lovely Bones"" transpires while Susie is in ""the in-between"" a candy-colored no mans land between heaven and earth where she watches her murderer (Stanley Tucci) hide in plain sight and her father (Mark Wahlberg) go mad with unresolved grief.What is ""The Lovely Bones"" about? I still dont know. If it means to be a portrait of a family coming apart after an unspeakable loss then why introduce a blowsy boozy grandmother played for broad comic effect by Susan Sarandon? If its a taut game of cat-and-mouse between a grieving father and the creepy dollhouse hobbyist next door why not let it be that and let the metaphysics take care of themselves?Jacksons fans have been wondering how he would deploy the special effects hes known for in the service of a story that has one foot in the supernatural and one in grounded realism. The answer is awkwardly without subtlety and often in ways that are tiresomely obvious. (You can bet that the boats Wahlbergs character likes to build in bottles will come smashing up against some hallucinatory shore.)The two best performances in ""The Lovely Bones"" belong to Ronan whose translucent blue eyes give her an appropriately otherworldly beauty and Tucci nearly unrecognizable under a sandy mustache and wire-rimmed glasses. But even these sturdy actors cant bring focus to a film that never decides what it wants to be. (One cant help wondering what a filmmaker with the taste and tonal control of a Sofia Coppola say might have done with the same material.)As ""The Lovely Bones"" lurches toward its eventual conclusion the viewers befuddlement is likely to give way to anger when the whole point of the movie seems to be for Susie not to miss her first sexual experience. And anger gives way to outright rage when in the films most breathtakingly awful sequence she meets her fellow murder victims in a golden nimbus of morbid sisterhood.Its a ghastly even hateful moment and considering the wild shifts and switchbacks that have gone before completely unearned. ""The Lovely Bones"" wants you to think that its deep but its as shallow as the shoals where those ships in their bottles fetch up. The whole movie feels like a juggernaut of literary pretension and cinematic overreach run fatally aground.Contains mature thematic material disturbing violent content and images and profanity. 130 minutes.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Lovely Bones"" is a reverse murder mystery. Theres no question about what happened to Susie Salmon; in the first minute of the film she informs us that she was kidnapped and killed at age 14. Speaking from a section of the hereafter she calls ""the in-between"" she observes her family grappling with the aftermath of her disappearance and her killer going about his business undetected. Susies cheerful narration never seeking our pity yet dispensing compassion to those she left behind is our first clue that this will be a crime story like no other. Adapted from Alice Sebolds acclaimed novel the structure is intricate and the telling is deft with interludes alternating between two distinct sections. The first largely concerns Susies murder in a Philadelphia suburb and its investigation. It is set mostly in 1973 as the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the dark chasm of the Manson Zodiac and Dean Corll serial murders. The second section involves her experience of the afterlife where Susie lingers hoping to guide her family though their sorrow to see her murderer apprehended and to come to terms with ""the world without me in it."" The first section with its bell-bottomed fashions and modish middle-class decor looks as if it was art-directed by the Partridge Family. Splashed with cheerful colors its a time of somewhat forced optimism a Sears family portrait with worry lines around the eyes. The Salmons count their pennies; Dad played by Mark Wahlberg as an overgrown Hardy Boy is an accountant. Mom (Rachel Weisz) has traded in her philosophy books for ""Hints From Heloise"" and Susie (Saoirse Ronan) frets that the dreamy boy in her film club doesnt reciprocate her crush. She makes a date to meet her dreamboat in the local malls gazebo which becomes the films symbol for innocence and romance. Instead shes entrapped in an underground chamber constructed by skeevy neighbor George Harvey. Stanley Tucci broadcasts a creepy vibe by disguising his nasty intentions. His voice wheedles his gaze darts his beige-on-beige coloration suggests bland camouflage. Hes a void crafting elaborate dollhouses as empty of life as his own home. The scrapbook of clippings he keeps about the girl up the street is a stomach-twisting inversion of parental pride. Whenever he appeared onscreen I felt my guts churning. The sequences in ""the blue horizon between heaven and Earth"" where the murdered Susie waits until her earthly business is done are radiant. The dreamscapes resemble rainbow-hued covers of 70s rock albums Susie would know; the lighting grows vibrant or shifts with her emotions like a cosmic mood ring. And Susie like her grieving parents has lots of feelings to channel. When she refuses her spirit guides advice to let go of life and move on the consequences are ugly in her spirit world and brutal on Earth. THE LOVELY BONES  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for disturbing content and adult language. A film alternating between suburbia and the astral plane would seem designed to fail but director Peter Jacksons adroit editing makes each sequence give urgency and momentum to the next. The films soothing wonderland episodes impinge on suspenseful moments in ways that ratchet up the tension. Jackson stages a couple of nerve-shredding cat-and-mouse scenes; in one a detective played by ""Sopranos"" star Michael Imperioli appears to be shadowing the killer through one of his eerie doll houses. Toward the end theres a nail-biting bit involving Susies spirit and evidence of her murder that swerves 180 degrees from the conclusion most stories would deliver. Movie murders usually trigger a clockwork plot of police procedure or vigilante retribution with culprits brought to justice and wrongs avenged. ""The Lovely Bones"" has different goals. Its concern is the psycho-spiritual fallout of a murder after the body and the investigation have gone stone cold. It suggests something almost unheard-of in crime stories The closure that survivors need isnt catching the criminal but rather healing the trauma and moving on with life. Broken bones heal tragedies pass and obsessions with old wrongs can only harm the survivors. Love and domesticity by their very nature are a rebuke to the death drive embodied by Susies solitary killer. Rarely has a film launched by a killing seemed so insistently alive. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Lovely Bones Drama. Starring Saoirse Ronan Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Peter Jackson. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a difference between picturing something and seeing something. Thats the difference between books and movies a difference that works to the detriment of ""The Lovely Bones"" based on the novel by Alice Sebold. The same opening thats compelling on the page - ""I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6 1973"" - becomes the focus of dread for a movie audience because we know sooner or later that were going to be forced to sit through something we dont want to see. Even if director Peter Jackson ultimately chooses not to render the murder in graphic terms actually seeing a young girl being tricked by a predator and gradually becoming terrified feels more than disturbing. It feels profane. To be specific it feels almost as if by watching were violating her too - not Susie Salmon the central character and not Saoirse Ronan the brilliantly talented young actress who plays her - but all the real-life Susies. Even when presented with sensitivity respect and taste theres just something unsettling about public entertainment thats made from this particular variety of private suffering.

Photo DreamWorks Pictures Review The Lovely Bones 1 / 1 Back to Gallery What is there to be gained from this that we should feel worse? Or come to some false sense of understanding that makes us feel better about something we shouldnt feel better about? So ""The Lovely Bones"" is difficult viewing a meticulously crafted experiment that it turns out wasnt worth it. For the first third we dread the murder. For the other two-thirds interspersed with scenes on Earth we see Susie in some version of the afterlife to which Jackson devotes all his artistry as a visual technician. Of all the nonaction movies ever made ""The Lovely Bones"" may be the most special-effects heavy and at times Jackson gets carried away. Even when he doesnt Jacksons afterlife belongs only to him and its a poor substitute for any afterlife you yourself might imagine from the page. Surprisingly - but maybe not if you appreciate the difference between print and film - the earthbound scenes work better. As a police detective (Michael Imperioli) investigates the murderer lurks in plain sight in the form of a seemingly harmless bachelor (Stanley Tucci) who lives down the street. Though prone to grand flourishes Jackson can do conciseness and control - as in the moment when the dead girls father (Mark Wahlberg) looks at the guilty neighbor and suddenly knows everything. Jackson doesnt adorn the moment with any thundering on the soundtrack or imagined flashbacks. He just lets it land. The movies one false note comes in the form of Susan Sarandon as Susies lusty hard-drinking grandmother who is comic relief in a film that cant have any. And what was Jackson thinking by throwing in a montage of Sarandon to the accompaniment of the Hollies old hit ""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress""? Still the suffering of the father and mother (Rachel Weisz) the strain on their marriage the calibration of their emotions over the course of years - not to mention the passing of the years themselves - all these are treated with intelligence and insight. As someone who actually was 14 in December 1973 I also appreciated the re-creation of the era down to the David Cassidy photo in Susies locker. It remains out of focus but anyone who was alive at the time would recognize it. Its possible that a sparer rendering of the novel might have achieved a cleaner less dreamy and less inappropriately sentimental effect. But thats just a guess. A better guess is that Jackson made as good a film as could be made and that the flaws of ""The Lovely Bones"" as a film were built into the storys design. -- Advisory Violence and a subject that is off-the-charts disturbing.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + What does a movie owe to the book on which its based? Less than youd think actually. Its nice if the filmmakers are able to translate story lines key characters crucial themes from one medium to the other but literature and cinema are so radically different - one endlessly internal the other building only on what we see and hear - that its generally insane to even try. At the end of the day the movie needs to work as a movie nothing more or less.Peter Jacksons film of Alice Sebolds bestseller ""The Lovely Bones then is something special A spectacular cringe-inducing failure as both a book adaptation and a film. The miscalculation on almost every level is perversely thorough. Its as if the filmmaker faced with an endless series of daunting creative choices proudly took the wrong road each and every time.Maybe you have to be delusional though to try to create a tasteful movie out of a book narrated from limbo by a girl raped and murdered in the opening scenes. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan the young betrayer of ""Atonement and by far the best thing here) perches above her small 1970s Pennsylvania town in a sketchy but surreal afterlife watching over the years as her devastated family and friends cope with her disappearance. The novels tone is wistful elegiac detached in direct contrast to the agonizing events and emotions Susie describes and without that long-view naivete - Susies voice literally - the story might be impossible to endure.Jacksons first mistake is that he thinks we want to know what heaven looks like. Since ""The Lord of the Rings and ""King Kong have established the filmmaker as a reigning god of CGI he visualizes Susies afterlife as a series of vast endlessly morphing digitized landscapes - mountains swooping up moons swirling down tangerine trees marmalade skies. It looks like all 12 pages of a very expensive New Age calendar and it is kitsch; its also wholly beside the point. Susies heaven is unfinished because Susies life is; even Ronan seems to understand that.Jacksons second and much worse mistake is to jettison half the characters and story lines that were the books very reason for being. If youre familiar with the novel (and Im betting many are since Oprah did order the nation to read it) you know that the ""lovely bones of the title are the relationships that grow up in the wake of Susies murder. The cast of characters keeps expanding because thats how life progresses as an exponential gathering of human connection. Through Susies younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) were led to her boyfriend Samuel Heckler (Andrew James Allen) and to his moody older brother Hal; through Susies first kiss Ray Singh (Reece Ritchie creepily too old for his role) we arrive at his mother (Anna George) a neglected immigrant housewife and source of unexpected grace. And so on. Jackson and his co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens cut back or eliminate many of these characters even dropping the affair between Susies distraught mother (Rachel Weisz) and the investigating detective (Michael Imperioli). The two are reduced to casting moony looks at each other that go nowhere. Gifted actors are brought on and wasted Susan Sarandons boozy grandmother is a cartoon of the wise weathered character in the book and poor Mark Wahlberg spends the movie looking as if Susies father has been bonked on the head with a log which essentially he has.Jacksons third and worst mistake is to increasingly focus ""The Lovely Bones on the one person with no human connection George Harvey the man who murdered Susie. Hes played by Stanley Tucci as an assortment of hair and makeup choices (green contact lenses icky blond comb-over) and sweaty tics; the camera keeps pushing into his face so well know hes a monster. This is a rare case of a very good actor being allowed to give a very bad performance and its a further symptom of the directors haplessness with this material that he turns ""Bones into a serial-killer thriller cranking up the suspense over whether Lindsey will be Georges next victim.Suspense isnt what Sebold was writing about though and no amount of desperate cinematic retrofitting will make it so. Neither was closure or revenge which drove some readers batty. Instead the storys about forgiveness reconciliation moving on - qualities that dont lend themselves to the epic commercial cinema Jackson represents. The directors so far out of his element here that he makes one blunder after another turning Susies little limbo pal Holly (Nikki SooHoo) into a childlike ninny even botching the ghostly climactic resurrection that remains the books biggest stretch. (Jackson shows us the wrong characters face and thus commits his own unseemly act of movie pedophilia.)""The Lovely Bones isnt one of those fiascos thats so bad its good. You dont stand around the smoldering wreckage warming your hands the way you did with ""Glitter or ""Battlefield Earth. You just walk away appalled if you know the novel confused and vaguely disturbed if you dont. Jackson once made a fine unsettling fantasy-drama about teenage girls ""Heavenly Creatures but that was 16 years ago. These days he can only think big and so he takes this small fragile story and he breaks it.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

And it is tricky with its tone of grief and loss but also hope and humor.Susie Salmon (Atonements troublemaker Saoirse Ronan) a 14-year-old who lives with her family in Norristown Pa. is murdered by a neighbor. Its December 1973 and the Salmons - Mark Wahlbergs Jack and Rachel Weiszs Abigail - are understandably devastated.The conceit of Sebolds novel and of Jacksons loopy interpretation is that Susie now looks down on her bereaved parents and her younger sister (Rose McIver) watching from the afterlife as they grapple with the tragedy. And she watches as Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci) her killer goes nervously about his business tending to his dollhouse and trying to cover his tracks - and conceal his journals about the young girls he has raped and put to death. (Tuccis performance is twitchy and icky. His awards-season kudos are I think more a recognition of his gumption for taking on such an unpleasant role than for anything he does with it.)And so Jackson has fashioned two worlds a drab 70s suburbia with cul-de-sacs and malls populated by folks in Partridge Family-style getups the cars and the music meticulously accurate. (Jackson and company shot the film in Sebolds original setting suburban Philadelphia.)And then there is this not-yet-heaven place where Susie is joined by a gaggle of bubbly young girls who like her were victims of rape and murder. (Jackson doesnt show Susies rape in any explicit manner - its only suggested at when Mr. Harvey takes her to his subterranean lair.) Its in Jacksons CGI-crazy rendering of this ""in between"" reality that The Lovely Bones goes terribly awry he creates a universe of shooting stars of glowing orbs rolling across fjords and mountains with smiling Susie gamboling over sun-dappled fields (Jackson borrows from Andrew Wyeth echoing the painters famous Christinas World but turning the image acid-trip intense). Sometimes these scenes suggest ads for antidepressant medication or feminine hygiene products but mostly they serve as jarring reminders of whose handiwork the movie is a guy running haywire through his own elaborate CGI toy shop Jacksons Weta Digital.It doesnt help any that Wahlberg looking perpetually dumbstruck is among the clunkiest line-readers working in movies today. Or that Susan Sarandon shows up as Susies boozy grandma acting as though shes in another film - a noisy family comedy say not a soul-crusher about a family torn to pieces.Tonally visually conceptually The Lovely Bones is all wrong. There is only one sustained section when Susies sister Lindsey suspicious of the creepy neighbor played by Tucci breaks into his house and goes digging for clues - and he returns from an errand to find her there - that seems to work as intended. It is chilling and suspenseful with another girls life placed in jeopardy.And if Lindsey is caught and killed who knows? Jackson would probably have her go skipping merrily down the psychedelic hills and dales of limbo land holding hands with her sibling as a celestial chorus sings selections from the songbook of Hair.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The Lovely Bones Bad to fair Director Peter Jackson. Cast Saoirse Ronan Stanley Tucci Mark Wahlberg. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material disturbing violence and language. RELATED Ronans career takes Lovely turn Tuccis career Highs lows and Bones From bestseller to movie Ghost stories Its understandable of course and useless. A movie must stand on its own as an individual work. In that regard ""The Lovely Bones"" is a disappointment. (Full disclosure I havent read the book so my impressions are untainted by comparisons.) Peter Jacksons adaptation of the well-loved novel by Alice Sebold boasts good performances by Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon the young murder victim who narrates the tale and Stanley Tucci as George Harvey her killer. This is not a spoiler; we know all of this information almost from the start. This isnt a murder mystery because no mystery is involved at least from the audiences point of view. Jacksons scattershot direction ultimately falls short. As gifted a director as exists when it comes to using computer-generated effects - perhaps youve heard of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy - Jackson here cant quite square the technology with the emotion. At times his images of the In-Between the realm from which Susie watches over the devastation wreaked upon her family by her murder are gorgeous. Yet at others particularly when she first arrives there they are so cartoony that you half expect her to visit the Island of Misfit Toys or pay the Abominable Snow Monster a call. The story takes place in the 70s an era Jackson re-creates to perfection. Susie is a high-school student a normal kid living with her parents Jack and Abigail (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) and younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver). Like any kid she has crushes enjoys hobbies - her photography skills will come in handy later in the story - and generally has fun hanging out. But one day she doesnt come home from school. We know why. But her parents do not despite the best efforts of the police (Michael Imperioli plays a detective) and their loss coupled with the uncertainty eats away at them. That leads to a visit from Abigails booze-soaked mother played by a wildly overacting Susan Sarandon and to separation. Some of the Earth-bound scenes are effective including an exchange between Imperiolis detective and George. A nearly silent showdown between Jack and George in Georges backyard where the two men suddenly come to the realization of shared knowledge of guilt is even better. And Jacksons depiction of Lindsey trying to find evidence that George is the killer is edge-of-your-seat stuff making you wish for more of this kind of thing. Tucci is terrific creepy as can be but in subtle ways as befits the vile nature of his character. Ronan is also good though her role is more difficult. There is one particularly affecting scene in which she glimpses her sister experiencing a rite of passage shell never have but for the most part shes much better with her feet on the ground as it were. The same is true of ""The Lovely Bones"" overall as well. Its a competently made movie - in Jacksons hands it could hardly be anything but - yet rarely a moving one.

"Lovely Bones The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lovely-bones-the ) Lovely Bones The (United States/United Kingdom/New Zealand 2009) December 25 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Maybe theres some truth to the assertion that Alice Sebolds novel is unfilmable. After all if a visionary like Peter Jackson who crafted a nearly perfect cinematic adaptation of The Lord of the Rings cant do it who can? Perhaps the issue is that Jackson tried to stay too true to the source material. Despite significant cuts and instances of condensation the plots skeleton tracks well with Sebolds book but therein lies the roots of a problem the movie features wild swings in tone and fails to draw the viewer into the story. The story told by Jacksons The Lovely Bones is the same as the one related by Sebold but it lacks the complexity and empathy evident in the book. The narrator Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) opens the movie by informing us that shes dead. In fact she tells us the day of her death December 6 1973 (at the age of 14). The first quarter of the film provides a flavor of who Susie is by depicting incidents from her life how her quick thinking saves her little brother how she harbors a crush on a boy at school and how she and her father share a passion for art (he is obsessed with building ships in bottles; her hobby is photography). Then one day on her way home from school she is waylaid by a nebbish neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). He lures her into an underground room and thats the last we see of her alive. Her disappearance and apparent death sunder the family. Abigail (Rachel Weisz) Susies mother packs up and leaves. Jack (Mark Wahlberg) Susies father stews in a vat of self-recrimination believing himself to be somehow responsible. And Lindsey (Rose McIver) Susies sister harbors suspicions about Harvey that she does little to hide. This makes her a potential target. Meanwhile in the afterlife Susie watches all of these things transpire while interacting with her new dead BFF Holly (Nikki SooHoo). Heaven as depicted in The Lovely Bones is not a place Id be anxious to visit. Filmmakers have always struggled with depictions of the afterlife and Jackson is no exception. The only director I can recall making a compelling film about life-after-death is Hirokazu Kore-eda whose 1998 picture Afterlife is a small masterpiece. Although Jacksons interpretation of Susies heaven is technically impressive it lacks emotional resonance. Its pretty but vacuous and every time the film focuses on the characters inhabiting it the proceedings grind to a halt. While Susie is alive shes an interesting character. Once shes dead she is dull and providing her with a ""storyline"" seems pointless. Devoting an inordinate amount of time to Susies navigation of the afterlife robs the film of an ability to tell the familys story in full. Short-cuts are taken occasionally making actions seem poorly motivated or out-of-character. The scene in which Jack realizes Harvey is the killer is ineptly handled - the leap of logic he makes doesnt seem reasonable given the evidence at hand. No attempt is made to flesh out Harveys character; he is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill motion picture serial killer. The need to limit the running time results in choppy and incomplete character arcs and the way in which the film concludes although representative of what happens in the book comes across on-screen as contrived and unsatisfying. A degree of criticism has been leveled at Jackson for sanitizing what happens to Susie. Theres no way The Lovely Bones should be PG-13. The subject matter - that of a 14-year old girl being raped murdered and dismembered by a serial killer - is by nature intended for mature audiences. To ""soften"" things no mention is made of a sexual assault (either with Susie or the other victims) and most of the violence occurs off-screen. Jacksons approach turns aspects of the story that should be disturbing and uncomfortable into ones that are significantly less difficult to digest. This has the unintended consequence of diminishing the emotional impact of what happens to Susie and how it traumatizes her family. A graphic depiction of Susies fate would not have been necessary but the near-total avoidance of the horror of what happens in the underground room undermines the production. The best performance is provided by Stanley Tucci although his role is thankless. By his acting he makes Harvey seem more like a sad lonely introvert than a psychopath but the character is too thinly drawn for Tucci to transform his alter-ego into one of the great tortured movie villains. Saoirse Ronan is fine as Susie - full of life (even when shes dead) and sparkle but this performance doesnt measure up to the one she gave in Atonement. The rest of the cast is merely okay. Rachel Weisz doesnt have many scenes. Susan Saradon (as Grandma Lynn) is superfluous. And Marc Wahlberg never seems to get a handle on Jack. Considering how well Jackson handled the ebb and flow of Heavenly Creatures its surprising that he fails to make The Lovely Bones more than a disappointing curiosity. Based on the evidence at hand it is difficult to determine whether a decade of fashioning epic motion pictures (The Lord of the Rings King Kong) has impeded Jacksons ability to effectively tell small character-driven stories or whether the book he chose to adapt would defeat anyone. Regardless of the reasons the bottom line is that The Lovely Bones doesnt work and thats a disappointment.

Whew. Color me relieved. There is no need to fear death even the most horrifying kind of murder. Be cause the afterlife is ex actly like the album cover for a 1970s progressive-rock band. So ditch your moody blues and come sail away to the point of know return. Thats where Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan the scary girl from ""Atonement"" who this time is merely adequate) roams the freaky fields of ""the in-between"" -- shes been waitlisted for heaven -- while back on Earth pop (Mark Wahlberg) and mom (Rachel Weisz) search respectively for her murderer and for escape. When her dad is smashing his collection of tiny ships in bottles its reflected in Susies netherworld by giant distorted images of the same as though shes standing too close to the screen at a drive-in theater. When things are going well she sees a symbolic tree in a hyper-green pasture that practically burns with ripeness. More dire moments mean inky swells of murderous waves. The universe is her mood ring. Its all a gorgeous error a bonfire of overreach from the (long-winded too serious and overrated) ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson. The story if any (the movie isnt really a murder mystery nor a quest for justice nor even a guidebook to acceptance closure and healing although portions tread each of these paths) is carried away on a blast of imagery. The movie is roughly as serious about death and dying as ""Its a Wonderful Life."" It uses the excruciating fact that innocents sometimes get murdered to wedge open a door to a landscape of sentimentality populated by Willy Wonka wonders. Jacksons commitment though is utter. I respect that as much as I scoff at the movies magic icicle and its notion that our dead loved ones are telepathically reaching out to us. Id much rather sit through a dazzling intrepid fever-dream than more dull cinematic tutelage on the evils of war or racism. Susie who at the start of the film is a 1973 teen who wants only to get kissed by the cute English guy (Reece Ritchie) at school never makes it to her date with him -- at a gazebo that becomes a totem of her post-life dreamland. Instead middle-aged neighbor George Harvey builds an elaborate trap and lures her into it. That scene and Stanley Tuccis performance as the wheedling creep are fantastically disturbing without being explicitly violent. Tucci goes the full Hinckley with his pervy mustache his losers windbreaker his sinister spectacles and his maladjusted little laugh. Despite his stock villainy -- the character simply needs to kill thats all there is to him -- Tucci bores in like a virus. Its Oscar-level evil a piece of acting you wont soon shake off. Making an almost equal but opposite impression Susan Sarandon plays the dead girls brassy grandmother a nicotine-addled and falsely eyelashed creature who sweeps into the household as the Weisz character falls nearly catatonic with grief neglecting her remaining children. The movie positions the grandma as comic relief unable to make a meal without starting a blaze and trailing a spoor of cigarette ash. But she turns out to represent the familys best strategy for coping a lively determination to focus (albeit ineptly) on small tasks while the larger pain slowly fades. Jackson would have done well to explore her character more and spare us the attention he lavishes on the supernaturally infused pre-Goth girl (her look anticipates Ally Sheedy in ""The Breakfast Club"") Susie thinks is kind of weird but who naturally functions as a psychic radio programmed to catch Susies vibes after she dies. If youre going for an emotional finish as huge as eternity try not to make me think of Whoopi Goldberg in ""Ghost."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jon Gosselin barred from appearances that violate TLC cont...

One of the things we learn about that bone-crunching sport comes in the form of a wry joke Soccer is a gentlemans game played by hooligans while rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen. Clint Eastwoods new movie is an inspirational game played by Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as the captain of a South African rugby team. Its also a win-win situation in which a mainstream feature works equally well as stirring entertainment and a history lesson about a remarkable convergence of sports and statesmanship. The time is 1995. Nelson Mandela a free man after 27 years in prison has just become president of a postapartheid South Africa thats still in racial turmoil. To help unify the nation Mandela embraces the most unlikely of popular causes a team called the Springboks that has been a symbol of white supremacy. ENLARGE Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby player Francois Pienaar in Invictus. Warner Bros. This may sound like some high-concept notion concocted by a Hollywood studio but the notion was Mandelas from the start--hed been a passionate athlete as a young man--and Anthony Peckhams script takes no more than reasonable liberties with the solid reporting of John Carlins book ""Playing the Enemy."" South Africas first black president did reach out to inspire the teams white captain Francois Pienaar; the team did shake off its losing ways thereby gaining the devotion of black and white fans alike and the Springboks did against huge odds defeat a supposedly invincible New Zealand team to win the 1995 World Cup championship. (Its even true that during the final game a South African Airways jumbo jet buzzed the stadium as the film depicts with the words ""Good Luck Bokke"" painted on the underside of its wings.) Factual truth doesnt guarantee effective drama but ""Invictus"" has something else going for it the convergence of a great actor and a great character. Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela is like a virtuoso playing Bach on a Stradivarius while moving serenely around the room. Beyond the warmth the humor and the phenomenally accurate vocal rhythms Mr. Freeman embodies Mr. Mandelas quiet moral authority and his capacity for forgiveness. Though the film often flirts with sanctification the actor resists it with quiet humanity. Though Mr. Peckhams script serves up didacticism by the large mouthful--""In order to build our nation we must all exceed our expectations"" Mandela tells Pienaar--the words emerge from Mr. Freemans mouth as heartfelt eloquence. Matt Damon acquits himself honorably too both as an Afrikaner athlete opening up to the revolution around him and a strong physical presence on the field. A strong enough presence that is to compensate for a shaky sense of the star actually playing on the team. The filmmaking is undistinguished at best--not just Clint Eastwoods stiff slow-paced direction but the cinematography and the music which comes around slowly to tapping the richness of African sources. And the charms of rugby are as opaque at the end as they were at the start. Yet the remarkable thing about ""Invictus"" apart from the fact that it got made--thanks to Messrs. Eastwood and Freeman--is that its substance so thoroughly transcends its technique. (The film takes its title which means unconquered from the William Ernest Henley poem that occupied a place of honor on Nelson Mandelas prison wall.) The story uses the presidents new squad of bodyguards as a microcosm of South African society--black and white they are not a congenial group--and the device is astute. To watch this Mandela moving through crowds that may love him or loathe him is to understand the danger he lived with--though we know he was not assassinated the spectacle of a black president in public places has an eerie resonance--and the state of grace he continues to live in. The Lovely Bones Peter Jacksons film version of ""The Lovely Bones"" like Alice Sebolds widely admired novel is partly set in an Inbetween that occupies an ethereal space between heaven and earth; its the vantage point from which the young heroine watches over her family after her death. I watched the film in an agitated space between engrossed and aghast. I dont know how you give yourself fully to a film or a book that turns on a child being murdered by a monstrous pervert. I mean that literally not judgmentally. I dont know how to do it and didnt want to do it so Im not one of those who found the novel an expression of religious faith. Still theres much for anyone to admire in the film starting with several superb performances Saoirse Ronan as Susie the anguishingly innocent victim; Stanley Tucci as Mr. Harvey Susies killer and a diabolical machine doing a convincing impersonation of a human being; Mark Wahlberg as Susies father; Rachel Weisz as her mother; and Rose McIver as her younger sister. (Susan Sarandon plays Susies lusty grandmother a sort of Annie Savoy gone to seed; it might have been better if she hadnt.) ""I loved the way a photo could capture a moment before it was gone"" Susie says she had wanted to be a photographer and accidentally snapped a shot of her killer-to-be. Mr. Jackson and his cinematographer Andrew Lesnie capture some lovely moments Susie watching her father build a ship in a bottle; the sweet expression on her face as she bicycles past her home Instamatic at the ready; her wonderment when as a little girl she contemplates a penguin inside a snow globe. But the details of her death are horrific even though were spared the worst of them. (The most terrifying shot may be the most placid; her killer a moist towel over his face enjoying a soak in a hot tub). The back-and forth structure of the narrative--Susie living life Susie observing life--can be maddening. And the film doesnt sustain much interest as a detective story even though it devotes a lot of time to solving the crime. Then theres the problem of that Inbetween. ENLARGE Saoirse Ronan is a murder victim in The Lovely Bones. DreamWorks Studios Reading the book we create our own vision of it; thats the unique magic of literature. Watching the play that strongly influenced the book Thornton Wilders ""Our Town"" we can do something of the same since the stage is bare and the governing principle is simplicity verging on austerity. But simplicity is not to put it mildly the principle that governs Mr. Jacksons movie. Mr. Jackson is of course our reigning master of fantasy; his ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a landmark in the history of cinema. Its easy to see why he might have been attracted to ""The Lovely Bones"" which shares the themes of fantasy and murder with ""Heavenly Creatures"" the brilliant 1994 feature that put him on the international map. And at this point in his working life he can use the prodigious digital resources of Weta his production facility to conjure up infinite worlds of special effects. Which heaven help us is exactly what hes done to visualize the Inbetween. The result is dumbfounding and ludicrous in equal measure a too-muchness that makes the excesses of ""What Dreams May Come"" seem downright spartan. If Readers Digest did music videos they might look like this. The screen pulses with bathos and swirls with surreal images some of them shamelessly intercut with the life of Susies bereaved family on earth--giant ships in giant bottles fields of daisies butterflies cute dogs cherry blossoms baobab trees out of ""The Little Prince"" a hot-air balloon ice sculptures snow-covered mountains a gazebo in a lake the same gazebo in a corn field the same field lighted by a lighthouse. By the time Susie finally ascended to the highest realm I was not only aghast but so exhausted by her surfeit of experience that I heard as if touched by magic myself those deathless lyrics from Talking Heads ""Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens...."" Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Olympia (1938) Heres another case though a radically different one of sports serving politics. Leni Riefenstahl a singular artist and Hitlers favorite filmmaker used the occasion of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin for this documentary testament to the beauty of the human body and the power of athletic will. (Shed already done her phenomenal best to sanctify Hitler in ""Triumph of the Will"" the greatest propaganda film ever made.) In his definitive biography ""Leni"" the late Steven Bach gives the film its due as art but sees its ""airbrushed portrait of the New Germany"" as the propaganda it was always meant to be. ENLARGE Kiss the Girls (1997) When the role of God came up for casting in ""Bruce Almighty"" Morgan Freeman was a natural choice if only for his peerlessly mellifluous voice. In ""Kiss the Girls"" a warmed-over ""Silence of the Lambs"" directed by Gary Fleder Mr. Freeman meets his vocal match in Ashley Judd who is audibly her mothers daughter. He plays a cop and forensic psychologist searching for his missing niece one of several young and talented women presumed to have crossed a predators path. Ms. Judd is a quick-thinking kickboxing physician who manages to escape after a masked monster abducts her to his underground lair. ENLARGE Atonement (2007) In this screen version of Ian McEwans novel which Joe Wright directed from an adaptation by Christopher Hampton Saoirse Ronan is Briony the precocious 13-year-old who puts the plot in motion by jumping to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse; she lacks any understanding of adult behavior that might put what she thinks shes seen in sensible context. Keira Knightley is Cecilia Brionys older sister and James McAvoy is Robbie the talented son of a servant; theyre the star-crossed lovers of the piece. ""Atonement"" is romantic intelligent and finally shattering in its sweep and thematic complexity. --Joe Morgenstern Find related television listings at LocateTV.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 10 2009 614 PM Title The Lovely Bones In adapting Alice Sebolds 2002 novel ""The Lovely Bones"" Peter Jackson (""King Kong"" ""Lord of the Rings"") siphoned out all the soulfulness that made the authors combination thriller/afterlife fantasy a best-seller. In its place is a gumball-colored potboiler thats more squalid than truly mournful.Sebolds book wouldve had a tough leap to the multiplex no matter who guided it. But Jackson is too enamored with the idea of mixing heaven and the heebie-jeebies so hes made the skeevy equivalent of a Mitch Albom book with some pulp fiction pressed between its covers.In the film as in the novel the story is narrated by 14-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirise Ronan) who in 1973 becomes the latest victim of a suburban serial killer named George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). We barely meet her before she becomes a disembodied soul figuring out the afterlife.From Out There she watches her father (Mark Wahlberg) become obsessed with finding the murderer her mother (Rachel Weisz) pull away from the family and her sister (Rose McIver) grow up while George Harvey eludes a Pennsylvania detective (Michael Imperioli). Yet within her dream-like limbo Susie finds a life filled with as much color as her final moments were cruelly dark.Though that disparity was likely irresistible to a director known for his flourishes Jackson actually pulls back from real visual audacity in the afterlife scenes; he settles for one-part Surrealist painting two-parts perfume ad (a giant clock a huge face in the water giant snow animals under a cotton candy skies). And when Susies otherworldly guide a Vietnamese-American girl called Holly Golightly munches popcorn as she and Susie watch the Salmon family its clear Jackson has no gauge Hes either too cutesy or licking his chops over the lurking dread.He also has a good cast that he wastes. Weisz does little more than fret Susan Sarandon swans in from another movie altogether as Susies hard-drinking grandma and Tucci is hamstrung by obtrusive makeup and a flat ""average guy"" accent. (Hes so average the cops dont ask why childless George pulls dollhouses around shopping malls.) Wahlberg was directed to emphasize the mild OCD in Susies dad.At least Ronan (""Atonement"") lends the film an ethereal quality her crystal blue eyes and spooky calm being the one thing the movie gets right. She cant help the moments of ""Ghost""-friendly romance though involving Susie and the boy she never got to kiss. That worked better on the page.

TRAILER Get a taste of Peter Jacksons adaptation of the bestselling book Alice Sebolds best-selling The Lovely Bones falls into that category. The novel told from the perspective of a murdered 14-year-old girl is chilling and poetic. It cant have been easy to adapt because of its reliance on the musings of a dead omniscient narrator. But a device that works on the page comes off artificial and emotionless on-screen. The movie strikes clashing tones veering from lightheartedness to heavy-handedness. Its hard not to have high expectations of director Peter Jackson after TheLord of the Rings. And given his haunting Heavenly Creatures (1994) about teenagers and murder he would seem the right filmmaker to adapt this book. But the scenes that take place in an alternate universe -- a way station between heaven and Earth -- are jarring. Depicting heaven has long stymied directors and Jacksons cheesy computer-generated world breaks no ground. Saoirse Ronan (Atonement) is well-cast as the wide-eyed Susie Salmon who has a passion for photography loving parents (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) and a crush on a high school senior (Reese Ritchie). Walking home from school Susie is lured into an underground lair by the nebbishy George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Tucci gives a nightmare-inducing performance as the neighbor whose pleasantries are almost as scary as his violent predilections. Jackson gets the thriller scenes right. He sets up a tense sequence in which a detective (Michael Imperioli) and Harvey eye each other through the windows of a dollhouse. Susies sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) is suspicious and sneaks into Harveys house to find evidence in a suspenseful episode. But the conceit of Susie trapped in a DayGlo world between the one she left and her final resting place imparting lessons on coping with death feels preachy. Its more moving when she utters simply ""I was here for a moment and then I was gone."" Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 10 2009 1011 AM The Lovely Bones Peter Jacksons attempt to show us heaven. By Dana Stevens Saoirse Ronan in The Lovely Bones Theres something noble about filmmakers who are willing to use the medium to represent states of being outside of normal earthbound experience. These could be dreams drug trips unconscious states or for especially brave directors the experience of death and the afterlife. Most of the time the experiment doesnt work. Darren Aronofskys The Fountain in which Hugh Jackman travels to the edge of the universe in a floating bubble in order to keep his beloved Rachel Weisz from ever dying was a failure but a grand one. And its worth enduring a lot of lame shaky-camera drug-trip sequences when you come across the rare example that works like Mia Farrows all-too-real rape nightmare in Rosemarys Baby. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Attempts to show heaven on-screen have an even slimmer chance at success. The afterlife lends itself too easily to treacly kitsch--remember Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come? But if anyone could do it Peter Jackson would be the man. Upon first hearing that he was adapting Alice Sebolds best-selling novel The Lovely Bones I was thrilled. Jacksons Heavenly Creatures (1994) evokes the fever dreams of female teenage interiority as well as any movie ever filmed; its one of my favorite movies of the 1990s. The Lovely Bones (Paramount Pictures) the story of a 14-year-old girl trying to help solve her murder from the beyond seemed like perfect Jackson material an amalgam of horror suspense and fantasy that would combine Heavenly Creatures themes with Lord of the Rings budget. If The Lovely Bones at least for this critic fails its certainly not for lack of metaphysical gumption. Jacksons imagining of the afterlife is fearlessly florid a candy-colored Lisa Frank dreamscape thats exactly the kind of place a middle-class American girl might conjure up as her own personal heaven. Its when the movie returns to earthly life the prosaic world of suburban cul-de-sacs and family relationships that it falters. Susie Salmon (played by the 15-year-old Irish actress Saoirse Ronan) is a high-school freshman in 1973 just starting to chafe at her parents protectiveness and nursing her first real crush. On her way home from school one day shes waylaid by a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci barely recognizable in a blond comb-over) and murdered. (This is no spoiler; Susie makes her ghostly status known in the opening voice-over and we witness her killers identity soon after.) For the rest of the film she remains in a limbolike place called ""the in-between"" trying to send symbolic messages to her family members that the guy who did her in lives right across the street. Advertisement The Lovely Bones also exists in the in-between located somewhere in the interstices between thriller fantasy crime procedural (Michael Imperioli The Sopranos Christopher plays the detective who tries to catch Susies killer) and family-in-dissolution drama. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz play Susies grief-addled parents (they also have two younger children played by Rose McIver and Christian Thomas Ashdale). There are moments that remind you what a master craftsman Jackson can be like a pulse-pounding suspense scene in which Susies sister ransacks the killers house for evidence. But as Susie learns that avenging her death may matter less than giving her family a chance to heal the movie takes on a weirdly Oprah-esque tone as if determined to turn child murder into an occasion for personal growth. Scene by scene the movie alternates between prurient violence and sentimental uplift. If it werent for the luminous performance of Saoirse Ronan (who Ive said it before and Ill say it again is going to be a huge star) this would be the kind of movie youd give up on halfway through. Unfortunately the wonderfully expressive Ronan appears only as a silent specter in the scenes back on earth which comprise most of the film. The characters of the parents are unfocused; Wahlberg and Weisz are given little to do other than mourn flamboyantly. Weiszs role in particular makes no sense. When her grief drives her to leave the family for a stint on a migrant farm (picking oranges in a fetching hat fit for the Sun-Maid raisin girl) you lose all interest in the mothers trajectory. And Susan Sarandon in a painful comic interlude as the kicky drunken grandmother seems to be passing through on sabbatical from some other movie universe. Though Tucci transforms himself admirably--this lumbering sweaty pervert is light-years from the suave roles he usually chooses--his character is overdrawn enough to have come straight from a PSA warning children to keep away from strangers. Jackson is going to get ridiculed for the sappiness of his CGI-enhanced celestial visions but the cotton-candy snow slopes enchanted gazebos and football-field-sized blooming roses that Susie encounters in heaven are more believable than anything that happens in The Lovely Bones version of the real world.

In doing so Susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by Alice Sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson is based. But as directed by the lord of The Lord of the Rings from a screenplay by Jackson Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens his bleached Bones bears little resemblance to the book in either tone or complexity. Readers will be frustrated; newcomers to the story may wonder why what is now essentially a serial-killer thriller includes so many scenes of a heaven that looks like a gumdrop-colored hobbit shire a magical place of fanciful special effects. In Jacksons simplified sweetened and ? CGI-besotted telling The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens. (Theres no indication that Susie gets raped as she does in the novel and her murder occurs off screen.) Atonements terrific Ronan with her astonishing glacier-blue eyes watches from a scenic afterlife as her father (Mark Wahlberg) mother (Rachel Weisz) younger siblings and selected friends simultaneously heal from their loss and search for her killer. For comic relief the familys boozy granny (Susan Sarandon) arrives swathed in mink. Apparently participating in a burlesque movie Sarandon camps it up demonstrating terrible housekeeping skills and wreaking grande-dame havoc. As for the killer hes in plain sight from the beginning -- a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) with the hopeless comb-over and furtive mustache of an easy-to-spot perv. Tucci is jolting in the role honestly unsettling as he maintains an exterior of mildness that masks a grotesque interior. Electrifying danger accompanies his every scene. But this in itself becomes a problem as that same energy leaves the screen when he does. Jackson reduces his Lovely Bones in the end to the dramatic contrast between the menace of a hateful killer (will he be caught?) and the grief of a loving father (can he avenge his daughters death?). Sebolds Lovely Bones on the other hand is fleshed out with the perilous irresistible power of sex -- the author acknowledges a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded. The filmmaker handled the sexual power of girls beautifully in 1994s Heavenly Creatures. But here he shies from the challenge shortchanging a story that isnt only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth. Jackson forfeits depth for safe surface loveliness.

Hoberman With 3-D CGI Peter Jackson Makes a One-Dimensional Lovely Bones Tuesday December 8 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 This is where you go when you die.Dreamworks Studios A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A one-film cabinet of curiosities The Lovely Bones turns the most successful CGI director of the 00s loose on one of the decades prime literary phenomena Cults collide as Peter ""Lord of the Rings"" Jackson tackles Alice Sebolds bestselling New Age gothic the story of a rape-murder-dismemberment and its aftermath narrated by its 14-year-old victim from heaven.A season that has already brought adaptations of a once-controversial classic picture book about a disturbed child and its grown-up Doomsday evil twin (""normal"" child on the road in a disturbed world) is capped by a vision dramatizing the ultimate parental nightmare. In Jacksons hands The Lovely Bones is doubly appalling. Part Disneys Alice in Wonderland part Fritz Langs M the movie is horrific yet cloying alternately distended and abrupt sometimes poignant and often ridiculous.The Lovely Bones begins with a flurry of activity both inside the snow globe thats introduced as a metaphor for the afterlife and outside in the prosaic comforting suburban universe into which Susie (Saoirse Ronan) was born. The actress outstanding as the child snitch in Atonement is engagingly hyper-expressive and the filmmaking is similarly kinetic full of floating camera moves and breakneck cross-cutting. Jackson hits the high points of Susies young life speeding toward her brutal demise--but not so quickly as to bypass the novels provocative cautionary setup.Published in the aftermath of 9/11 The Lovely Bones adroitly comforting synthesis of Our Town and Anne Frank was widely appreciated as a lyrical tale of grief and reconciliation but it is also a malign fable of adolescent coming-of-age. Susies first kiss about to be delivered by her first crush is interrupted--and rudely de-romanticized--by the school principals irate tantrum over the anatomically correct female nude that Susies weird friend drew for art class. Ignoring this omen and walking on air in anticipation of her first date Susie is enticed down the rabbit hole that her strenuously innocuous serial-killing neighbor (Stanley Tucci barely recognizable and supremely creepy) has prepared as her death chamber. She leaves this world horrendously despoiled yet essentially innocent.Punishing sexual curiosity is not a foreign notion for Jackson who broke into movies making gross-out horror flicks. Fans will remember the scene in Dead Alive in which a chaste lads first kiss triggers his mothers transformation into a flesh-eating zombie. Still he has the tact to omit the gruesome details of Susies murder--and will later expunge the ludicrous scene in which Sebold allows the girls ecstatic return to earth.Unfortunately he shows no such discretion in literalizing the novels vague metaphysics. Once upon a time--see his 1994 comedy of adolescent matricide Heavenly Creatures--Jackson sensationally infused movie naturalism with garish special effects. Here all is subservient to the digital splendors of Susies heavenly abode--a constantly mutating realm of spacious skies purple mountains and undulating amber waves of grain not to mention crystal beaches foggy forests and the peripatetic cosmic gazebo from which she observes her family and murderers doings.All characterizations are sacrificed to steep in Susies celestial surroundings. Initially touching her parents (Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg) are dwarfed by the ongoing pyrotechnics. Stealing scenes as Susies cheerfully dissolute grandma Susan Sarandon struggles to provide the reality principle--in vain. Although the novel also drowned in a vat of syrup Sebold got by for nearly 100 pages on the unsentimental clarity of her style and sustained verisimilitude of the narrators adolescent voice. Jackson demonstrates no such chops. Indeed he consistently undermines the movies uncanny elements by over-dramatizing events such as Susies fleeting visitations that have their own inherent power.As the novel suggests a form of talk therapy Jacksons adaptation is a misguided tribute to the magic of the movies--which have always specialized in reanimating the dead. But there is something to be said for representing the actual world and there are some things that can only be visualized in the minds eye. What heaven could have been more radiant than a childs view of her suburban neighborhood--what spectacle more divine than Susan Sarandons wig?jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

By David Denby Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren as the Tolstoys in Michael Hoffmans movie.   Credit Illustration by Barry Blitt In ""The Last Station"" Christopher Plummer at the crest of a long career gives an impassioned portrait of the artist as an old man--Leo Tolstoy in his eighties imposing stentorian and almost alarmingly active. Helen Mirren letting her age show and still the most sexual actress onscreen is his equal as Sofya Tolstoys wife of forty-eight years. Like Tolstoy Sofya is built along heroic Old Testament lines she has borne him thirteen children; she has copied out ""War and Peace"" in longhand six times; she has run his household and loves him as passionately as ever. Based on Jay Parinis 1990 novel which draws heavily on diaries kept by the couple and by other men and women in their circle this production directed by Michael Hoffman is like a great night at the theatre--the two performing demons go at each other full tilt and produce scenes of Shakespearean affection chagrin and rage. The year is 1910 and Tolstoy is an uneasy survivor in the new century--hes bemused by a phonograph playing in his garden at Yasnaya Polyana. (A fine old house in Germany doubles as the estate.) As he approaches death he and Sofya fight over his will. Shall he leave the vastly profitable copyrights of his worldly masterpieces to his wife and their children? Or shall he bequeath them to the ""Russian people"" to be administered by an organization that propagates his late-in-life obsessions--a cultish neo-Christian neo-socialist religion that runs communes advocates passive resistance to violence and renounces sexuality? Sofyas nemesis in the struggle is Tolstoys chief disciple and administrator the fanatical Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) who introduces into the estate a youthful spy Valentin (James McAvoy) a celibate and an avowed Tolstoyan who becomes the writers secretary. Hes so awed that he can barely get a word out when he and Tolstoy first meet but his disapproval of the flesh disappears overnight after Masha (Kerry Condon) a terrifically flirtatious and intelligent fellow-acolyte climbs into his bed. Hoffman makes the scenes between the young lovers genuinely erotic so its not hard to guess which side the movie chooses in the philosophical dispute between asceticism and sensuality. Hoffman doesnt parody Tolstoys religious and pedagogical beliefs which after all exerted a major influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. yet the movie implicitly suggests that exalted self-denying spirituality however noble is less powerful as a guide to living than everyday love. Tolstoy no fanatic in his own cause seems to know this. In a beautifully written scene played with wistful longing by Plummer the old man talking to Valentin as they sit together in the forest at Yasnaya Polyana describes the early years of his marriage as a kind of terrifying paradise. Hoffmans career has wandered all over the place--he made the uproarious pop comedy ""Soapdish"" in 1991 and a mediocre ""Midsummer Nights Dream"" in 1999. In this movie he achieves a new expressiveness fluidity and power. ""The Last Station"" may not be original in form but its vibrantly alive with many scenes of scathing directness that seem to come straight out of Russian novels (though the pitch of feeling is closer to Dostoyevskys hyperthyroid manner than to Tolstoys firmer calmer tone). The juiciest material is Sofyas detestation of Chertkov whose celibacy she suspects is really just a cover for homosexuality. In any case shes sure that hes a poseur and an opportunist disguising his self-seeking with a veneer of piety. And for her Tolstoys anti-sensual bent is rubbish--this is a man of huge lusts who showed her his diaries of youthful whoring before their wedding. Sofyas situation is pitiable she still wants her husband sexually and will do anything to lure him back to bed and destroy his ideological purity. Helen Mirren may be the only actress who can beg for sex without losing a ferocious pride. Her Sofya dressed in white like a bride her hair long and full makes scenes howls and gets thrown about by her own anger and desire like a rag doll in a storm. Its the most emotionally naked work of Mirrens movie career; she gives poetic form to the madness and the violence of commonplace jealousy. Her look of pleading and then of tenderness toward Plummer is heartbreaking. Plummer who is turning eighty himself effortlessly suggests largeness of spirit even in foolish old age. Physically he seems enormous. His eyes devour McAvoys Valentin--his Tolstoy is hungry for information about everyone. He doesnt see why he has to choose between his wife and his followers; he wants everyones love and Sofya makes life at the estate complete hell. For him there is no peace except in flight and in death. In all the movie is worthy of its valiant pair. The splendor and the amplitude of Yasnaya Polyana affirm in every scene the magnificence of the sensuous world that Tolstoy with ambiguous energy and many fond backward glances so desperately wants to renounce. Theres another piece of extraordinary acting knocking about in the crowded Christmas season. What Jeff Bridges pulled off as a joke in ""The Big Lebowski"" lazing like a walrus he does seriously in ""Crazy Heart."" As Bad Blake a well-travelled country singer hes a barely functioning mess with a ratty beard and ponytail a large belly and a constant cigarette and glass of bourbon. Bad was once a famous performer and songwriter and hes written for other people including the darkly handsome young country sensation Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who openly acknowledges him as a mentor. But now Bad drives alone through vast stretches of the Southwest drifting from saloon to bowling alley performing with ragged pickup bands. He can still sing a little though he may not make it through a set without exiting the stage to go heave in an alley. The rest of the time he lies on his back in a squalid motel. As an actor Bridges luxuriates in indolence but Bad unlike the sublime Dude in ""Lebowski"" is not pleased with himself. Hes played out and past caring and Bridges muttering in a crabbed voice suggests a formidable intelligence fighting through a fog of drink and sloth. Bridges takes the character to the pits but hes spiritually active there at the bottom; he knows that Bad has to be shrewd and still proud in defeat or the audience would find him contemptible. Maggie Gyllenhaal ardent her round face glowing turns up as Jean Craddock a journalist and a single mother who penetrates the gloom of Bads motel room for an interview. At the start his attitude toward her is wary and distant but hes stirred by her interest and her loneliness. The first-time director Scott Cooper working from a novel by Thomas Cobb keeps the camera close to these two and the way that Bridges and Gyllenhaal ease into an affair--drawing together pulling back and starting again--feels right. Jean who must also look after her four-year-old son wakes up the decrepit singer but this is not a movie about miracles. Nor is ""Crazy Heart"" quite a miracle itself. It has a gentle unforced rhythm and whats there is good and true. But theres not enough of it--the movie needs more plot more complication more conflict--and it suffers from the mood of weary resignation embedded in Bads songs whose general theme is ""What the hell nothing can be done about it."" If ever a movie demonstrated how country music emerges from private sorrows this is it. But something can always be done to make a movie better. ""Brothers"" the new home-from-the-war film written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan has been made with obvious devotion and sincerity and I wish I could take it seriously. The movie is based on the 2004 Danish film ""Brodre"" but it feels like a 1948 Arthur Miller play without Millers toughness. Sam Shepard plays a dominating alcoholic father a former marine who has long tormented his two sons turning one Sam (Tobey Maguire) into a high achiever both athlete and war hero dutifully serving multiple tours in Afghanistan; and the other Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) into a resentful unemployable screwup. When Sam is captured his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) believing that hes dead leans toward Tommy who pulls himself together and helps her raise her and Sams two young children. Then Sam returns nearly destroyed by what he had to do to survive in Afghanistan. Will he be capable of resuming his marriage? Theres not much rooting interest for us since Maguire and Portman dont go together in the first place. Hes humorless and ungainly and odd-looking in his high-and-tight military haircut; shes elfin and flawlessly pretty and unconvincing as an ex-cheerleader turned mother of two and they dont set off the dimmest of sparks in each other. With the exception of Jake Gyllenhaal whose shambling self-disgust hits the only genuine note the movie is a classic of Hollywood miscasting and ambition gone askew. Maguire playing crazy when Sam comes home opens his eyes wider and wider as if he were trying to pop them out of his head. For three-quarters of an hour or so you wait for him to blow. And blow he does shrieking and smashing things in a display that seems more like pyrotechnics than like acting. To understand how this kind of role can be done with nuance and eloquence see Ben Fosters work in ""The Messenger"" a movie devoted to similar themes but finer in every way. Of all human illusions the hardest to give up is the belief that consciousness exists after death. This may seem a stiffly rational response to anything as shrewdly executed as Alice Sebolds best-selling 2002 novel ""The Lovely Bones"" but it becomes inescapable when you see the bizarre and sentimental movie that Peter Jackson has made from the book. In the movie as in the book Susie (Saoirse Ronan) a fourteen-year-old girl narrates her own murder in 1973 at the hands of a neighborhood creep (Stanley Tucci). Then she watches him cover his tracks and her father (Mark Wahlberg) her mother (Rachel Weisz) and her sister (Rose McIver) try to cope with her death. She is not merely present in their minds; they cant quite see her but she is there prompting warning claiming a kiss from her handsome teen boyfriend. The book was brought off with considerable delicacy--its really an affectionately detailed portrait of a suburban girls life. Literalized in the movie the material is closer to a high-toned ghost story. Jackson intermingles family goings on with Susies gossamer interventions and some of the brushed-with-ether imagery verges on the uncanny. Yet Jackson has become an undisciplined fabulist the movie is redundant and undramatic. Heaven is notoriously harder to make interesting than Hell but Jackson has outdone other artists in cotton candy--there are luscious hills and dales and gleaming lakes and fields of waving grain and sugarplum fairies with music by Brian Eno rather than by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. ""The Lovely Bones"" has been fashioned as a holiday family movie about murder and grief; its a thoroughly queasy experience. The lesson that Susie has to learn is that she must ""let go"" of her past life. Meanwhile skilled opportunistic artificers like Alice Sebold and Peter Jackson wont let go of a chance to mingle life and death.

The director of the worldly Heavenly Creatures (teenage girls murder) and the otherworldly Lord of the Rings certainly has a vision broad enough to encompass both heaven and earth which is where Alice Sebolds hugely popular novel takes place. Earth--specifically a suburban American town in 1973--is where 14-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is murdered at the start of the tale. Heaven--or an in-between station--is where she resides as the storys narrator able to see but not be seen by her family friends and killer. (Article continued below...)Jackson has found the perfect Susie in Ronan who dazzled as the deceitful English girl Briony in Atonement. Shes no less extraordinary as an American high-schooler brimming with life and expectation when she is killed by a mild-mannered neighbor Mr. Harvey (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci). With her pale blue eyes and quicksilver emotional transparency Ronan establishes such a rapport with the audience that we feel the loss deeply.That loss of course is mitigated by the bold conceit of having her narrating the events from the afterlife. This neat trick was at the heart of the novels success turning a bleak tale of murder and grief into one of consolation forgiveness and that favorite American trope ""closure."" Sebolds prose was the glue that held the novels disparate elements together. Onscreen however The Lovely Bones is a hybrid of unmatching parts--shuffling between thriller police procedural family melodrama and mystical fantasy. Theres even a section--when Susies madcap grandmother (Susan Sarandon) shows up to help the grieving family--during which the movie verges on becoming Auntie Mame. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week How do you literalize heaven? Its a problem moviemakers have struggled with forever and Jackson hasnt solved it. Sebolds notion was that everyone creates a heaven to fit her fantasies and wishes. Jackson creates the afterlife of a 14-year-old raised on 70s teen life and pop culture--a kitsch universe of greeting-card imagery and Renaissance Faire clothes. The tackiness intentional or not is jarring. Even worse is the vision of Susie and the other murdered girls as a happy gamboling clan of free spirits. At such moments the storys willful wish fulfillment seems downright cuckoo.Jackson does much better on terra firma. As a thriller The Lovely Bones can generate heart-stopping suspense when Susies sister sneaks into creepy Mr. Harveys house hoping to find evidence of his crime Jackson ratchets up the tension like the master he can be. And the grief Susies family feels is palpable. Mark Wahlberg plays her father whose obsession with solving the crime drives his wife (Rachel Weisz) away.Jackson knew he couldnt tamper too much with a book so beloved. By remaining faithful to Sebolds myriad flights of fancy however hes inadvertently highlighted the books vulnerabilities. When The Lovely Bones loses its grip on you its momentousness turns into silliness.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The source material might be more down to earth than King Kong but Jackson does everything in his power to ditch the real in favour of fantasy.The book was narrated from the grave by Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan in the film) a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered near her home. From a vantage point between heaven and earth Susie follows her parents (Mark Wahlberg Rachel Weisz) her sister (Rose McIver) and her killer Mr Harvey (Stanley Tucci) as she - and they - struggle to accept her fate. Not that we see anyone raped or murdered in this 100 million 12A version Jackson fatally softens the edges of the tragedy and its fallout.The real let-down is the films reliance on overblown effects to represent Susies limbo. Coming across as if Dali was commissioned to paint Middle Earth for the New Zealand tourist board the CGI scenes sideline the cast in favour of the magic of the animators hard drive. And it doesnt help that a gin-swigging Susan Sarandon plays Susies grandmother for comic effect just when you feel the film could do with some weight. And whos telling this story? It should be Susie and at points she narrates. But theres no consistency. Is she a ghost? A narrator? A heroine? A victim? Her chocolate-box world suggests its a 14-year-olds view of life. Yet there are entire sections when we forget Susies all-seeing eye and dont know whether were in a drama a thriller or a horror.Watch this confused unhappy film and weep a little for Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher) the British director who was first commissioned to write and direct it before it was swept away from her by higher powers.

Peter Jackson is a master film maker and I believe DOES possess the skills to make something as deep and as meaningful as a what could have been version of this film. Unfortunately the only three good actors here are the main girl her sister and Tucci. Whalberg is way out of his depth here and seems unable to muster the gravitas needed for these sort of roles. Thats not to say the film is not absorbing. Some of the incredible music and visuals do stir deep emotions and thoughts. But its incredibly flawed piece of cinema which is a shame I was hoping for more.

The one effective bit in the whole thing was actually the bit when Stanley Tucci lures her away and the only reason it was effective was because it was absolutely terrifying Reminded me of those films we used to get shown at primary school about stranger danger - really scary and bleak.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 30 2010Swron TestimonyFeaturedTHE MOVIE IS A TOTAL BUST AND DISAPPOINTMENT AND THAT IS THE GODS TRUTH..HERE IS WHY .How on earth could the same man that produced king kong The Hobit Trilogy release this work on to the public. The only assumption is a major health event has occured to Petger Jackson. The animation and rainbows and plot misdirection was unbearable. The subject matter is so timely and could have provided some heart wrenching emotions from the viewer and illustrated the seperation of life and death in the minds and hearts of families with insight and maturlity. All opportunities for the viewer to relate to this movie were overshadowed by the illusion ofsome fairytale limbo that was so disconnected they appeared to be totally unrelated. HOW VERY SAD ...

But George is a sly old psychopath whos always just about slipping through the flexible arms of the law. The Susie scenes in the not quite heaven are dragged out too much with the usual dream like landscapes straight outta the Wizard of Oz.

Peter Jacksons infatuation with fancy visual effects mortally wounds ""The Lovely Bones."" Alice Sebolds cheerily melancholy bestseller centered upon a 14-year-old girl who narrates the story from heaven after having been brutally murdered provides almost ready-made bigscreen material. But Jackson undermines solid work from a good cast with show-offy celestial evocations that severely disrupt the emotional connections with the characters. The books rep the names of Jackson and exec producer Steven Spielberg and a mighty year-end push by Paramount/DreamWorks will likely put this over with the public to a substantial extent but it still rates as a significant artistic disappointment. There has been cautious optimism among longtime Jackson followers that this material might inspire him to create a worthy companion piece to his 1994 ""Heavenly Creatures"" which similarly involves teenagers and murder in an otherwise tranquil setting and remains far and away his best film. The potential was certainly there in the book which reminds of Dennis Lehanes successfully filmed novels ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" in its devastating emotional trauma but offers the distinctive perspective of the most entirely plausible omniscient narrator in modern literature. Unfortunately the massive success Jackson has enjoyed in the intervening years with his CGI-heavy ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga (the source of which receives fleeting homage in a bookstore scene here) and ""King Kong"" has infected the way he approaches this far more intimate tale. Instead of having the late Susie Salmon occupy a little perch in an abstract heavenly gazebo from which she can peer down upon her family and anyone else -- all that is really necessary from a narrative point of view -- the director has indulged his whims to create constantly shifting backdrops depicting an afterlife evocative of ""The Sound of Music"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" one moment ""The Little Prince"" or ""Teletubbies"" the next. Its a shame because the first half-hour or so suggests that Jackson had he taken a vow to keep it real and use not a single visual effect still has it in him to relate a human story in a direct vibrant manner. Aided immeasurably by the spirited teen actress Saoirse Ronan (""Atonement"") who plays Susie the early scenes depicting the ordinary life of the Salmon family in a midsized Pennsylvania town possess a heightened quality charged by lively thesping and Andrew Lesnies dynamic mobile camera (pic was shot with the Red digital camera system). ""We werent those people those unlucky people to whom bad things happen"" Susie intones from above as we watch her interact with attractive young parents Jack and Abigail (Mark Wahlberg Rachel Weisz) sporty sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and younger brother Buckley (Christian Ashdale) boozy glamorpuss grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) and handsome first crush Ray Singh (Reece Ritchie) just before she announces she was murdered on Dec. 6 1973. Even before the deed is done its plainly stated that the perpetrator is neighborhood solitary guy George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) a man marked as creepy by his utter ordinariness. While Tucci adorned with stringy blondish-brown hair moustache large glasses and a raspy voice that tightens and elevates under pressure is good enough to validate all the scenes involving this bland monster Jackson shows his low-budget horror-film roots in the way he shoots the sinister scenes with silhouetting white lights heavy fog effects wide-angle closeups and generic synth backgrounding from Brian Enos otherwise effective score. While the script by the ""Rings"" trio of Fran Walsh Philippa Boyens and Jackson at first inventively reshuffles elements to cinematic advantage over time it serves more to dilute the impact of some story elements -- the fathers obsessive determination to nail George no matter what Lindsays romance the passage of years -- and eliminate others including Rays beautiful long-suffering mother and the relationship between Abigail and local cop Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) whose efforts to solve Susies murder are maddeningly frustrated. Once Susie is installed in her heavenly quarters for which Jackson digitally dedicates himself to continuously changing the wallpaper the emotional link to the family is ruptured and never fully repaired. There are intermittently intense scenes Lindsey proves herself a resourceful if somewhat reckless spy and the ever-meticulous George almost blows his cover on occasion. The way Jackson only partially reveals the killers face at times is effective but stands in stark contrast to the wobbly treatment of so much else. As the story progresses -- in a way that points to resolution in one sense and a simple petering out in another -- it becomes clear that the actors are being deprived of any meaty well-developed scenes to play; we learn more about them early on than toward the end making this a film of slowly diminishing returns. With reddish hair brilliantly alive eyes and a seemingly irrepressible impulse for movement and activity Ronan represents a heavenly creature indeed a figure of surging eager anticipatory life cut off just as it is budding. Less quicksilver and more solidly built McIvers Lindsey properly begins in her live-wire sisters shadow only to grow gradually into an impressive figure. Chain-smoking and depleting the liquor cabinet Sarandon camps it up for a few welcome laughs while Ritchie seems a likely candidate for teen idolhood. Mainly its Wahlberg and Weisz who are shortchanged by the films divided attention between earthly agony and astral accommodation. Both thesps are OK as far as things go but thats not nearly far enough. When it sticks to the everyday neighborhood inhabited by its characters ""The Lovely Bones"" which was shot on Pennsylvania locations and in New Zealand studios finds a reasonable equilibrium between drama and production values. When it ventures beyond it heaven turns into Hades.

""If you start something"" he tells Susie as hes completing one model ""you dont give up till youve finished it."" He glances up seemingly referring to the ship but staring right at Susie and adds ""That is a thing of beauty."" At that sweet moment Jack doesnt realize he wont have much longer to stare proudly at her. Across the pleasant suburban street in Norristown Pa. another man George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) is busy with his own hobbies. He has constructed a dollhouse pristine and perfectly appointed but untenanted. And in a nearby cornfield hes created an underground rec room filled with comic books and figurines and Cokes -- a kind of clubhouse where hed like to bring the local kids. One kid. Susie. (See the top 10 fiction books of 2009.) ""I was 14 years old when I was murdered on Dec. 6 1973"" Susie narrates in this creepy dreamy film of Alice Sebolds best seller directed and co-written by The Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson. The girl who vanished late one afternoon and is presumed to have been kidnapped or killed speaks to us from the in-between -- a mostly Edenic halfway house for the recently deceased a bridge between life and a hoped-for heaven. Its a fantasyland of penguin topiary and gigantic ice-sculpture ships where fields turn into soggy marshes and autumn becomes winter in a flash of fallen leaves. This engrossing nearly enthralling movie straddles multiple worlds as well Susies bright innocence Mr. Harveys meticulous depravity and Jacks ferocious determination to sleuth his daughters fate. Like Susies father and her murderer Jackson builds models -- the foam-rubber puppets of his early Meet the Feebles the exponentially more complicated imaginary realms of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong -- and invites children of all ages to share his obsessions. A director wants to trap life on film and the prime visual motif of The Lovely Bones is things in artificial enclosures a penguin in a snow globe a ship in a bottle the furniture in a dollhouse a girl underground a dead girl in between some lovely bones in a heavy safe. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) But a directors true gift is to animate these figures bring them to life. Jackson goes further he keeps Susie alive after shes died. Hes not going for gross-out effects here. He shows Susies attempt to escape from Mr. Harveys bunker but not her death. And though the film follows Mr. Harvey as he disposes of Susies remains it concentrates on the victim and her loved ones Jack his wife Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and their surviving daughter Lindsey (the appealing Rose McIver who plays Summer Landsdown on the ABC kids series Power Rangers RPM). She could be Mr. Harveys unmasker -- or his next victim. The New Zealand director began his career with horror movies. His well-named debut feature Bad Taste had aliens seeking human flesh for their outer-space fast-food chain and Braindead (a.k.a. Dead Alive) was a Sumatran-rat-plague movie about mother love gone spectacularly wrong. The Lovely Bones has elements of some of those mulchy horror films and another classic one -- this could be Psycho as told by the murdered Janet Leigh character. (Norman Bates had a hobby too taxidermy.) Jackson also allows a strong echo of his 1994 Heavenly Creatures a terrific fact-based study of a girlhood crush that blossoms into murder which pulled precocious performances from two teen beguilers Melanie Lynskey and the pre-Titanic Kate Winslet. But essentially the new film is a story of loving and mourning and loving some more. As Susie says of Mr. Harvey ""He didnt understand how much a father could love his child."" (See the top 10 movie performances of 2009.) The plot has a few pitfalls. Jack who fingers dozens of Norristown men as Susies potential abductor takes ages to notice the strange guy across the street. Abigail who departs and reappears with little organic reason is irrelevant to the central daddy-daughter bond. Abigails mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is around only as blowsy comic relief. But she does have one great line to Abigail who refuses to change anything in Susies bedroom Lynn says ""You have a tomb in the middle of your house"" In a way thats true of all the Salmons. With Susie gone they have a tumor in their collective heart. The movie is packed with privileged moments. A few are grimly comic like the interior decoration of Mr. Harveys subterranean playroom; his choices of teen artifacts are both pathetically out of date and a window into a life of outsider lunacy. And some moments have the most poignant tang. From the in-between Susie has a glimpse of Lindseys first kiss -- an ecstasy Susie was so close to experiencing before she entered Mr. Harveys lair that she hopes she can feel for real before she goes to heaven. (Read a book review of The Lovely Bones.) Tucci plays the killer not with a madmans sneers and cackles but with a quiet malevolence; hes never more ice-shivery than when hes pretending to be normal. Such a performance could have upset the movies balance if Wahlberg hadnt provided the solid foundation of parental devotion. The center of course is Ronan the Irish teen best remembered as the girl whose lie set lives tumbling in Atonement. As the dead girl hovering over her family like a guardian angel Ronan makes Susie seem an ordinary child whom catastrophe has made otherworldly-wise. Through Jacksons art and Ronans magic the obscenity of child murder has been invested with immense gravity and grace. Like the story of Susies life after death thats a miracle.
