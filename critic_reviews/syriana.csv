Comments Syriana Recommended Stephen Gaghan who won an Oscar for writing Traffic (1999) turns his attention to another complex economy with this geopolitical intrigue about Middle East oil though this time his ambition has outstripped his storytelling skills--even after two viewings Id be hard-pressed to explain some of the characters relationships to one another. George Clooney bearded and chunky plays a veteran CIA officer who cant get behind the agencys neoconservative template Matt Damon is a financial analyst who parlays his young sons tragic death into a multimillion-dollar job with the son of an Arab emir Jeffrey Wright is a meek corporate attorney greasing the wheels for a merger of two U.S. oil giants and Christopher Plummer is--well you tell me. This is intelligent committed and politically provocative though its narrative puzzle box may prompt you to throw up your hands and let ExxonMobil go on running the world. Gaghan directed; with Chris Cooper Amanda Peet Peter Gerety Alexander Siddig and Tim Blake Nelson. R 126 min. By J.R.

Theres a method to this murkiness it turns out. Like the myriad schemers in the movie--oil-rich Arab princes Texas entrepreneurs CIA operatives Islamic fundamentalists Washington lawyers Justice Department investigators--Gaghan uses misdirection to achieve his goals. He takes us into a world thats built on moral quicksand where the good guys act like bad guys and the bad like good and everyone has perfectly good reasons to do the terrible things they do. And when the pieces come together and clarity is finally restored what you discover can make your hair curl.As he did in his Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Traffic"" Gaghan shuffles multiple stories often continents apart only gradually unveiling how theyre connected. Theres an Arabic-speaking CIA agent left out in the cold by his handlers in Washington played by a bearded heavyset deglamorized George Clooney. Theres an ambitious Washington lawyer (Jeffrey Wright) investigating a questionable merger between two Texas oil firms--that want drilling rights in Kazakhstan and the powerful boss of the law firm (Christopher Plummer) who insinuates himself in the power struggle between two heirs vying to become the emir of a Persian Gulf country. One of those princes (Alexander Siddig an actor to watch) has given his countrys drilling rights to the Chinese which makes him an official enemy of the U.S. government. Yet his new adviser (Matt Damon) is an American oil consultant based in Geneva whos parlayed the tragic death of his son at the emirs Spanish home into an economic opportunity. At the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder is an unemployed Pakistani migrant oil worker (Mazhar Munir) whos taken under the wing of a radical Islamic mentor.The movie is partly (and loosely) based on the exploits of CIA agent and author Robert Baer the model for Clooneys character. Gaghan did massive research before writing and you can feel it in the dense information-packed texture. In its suspenseful two hours ""Syriana"" packs in enough material for two movies. Sometimes you wish Gaghan would simply slow down and let us linger awhile with his characters. What we get instead are merely tantalizing glimpses of their fraught home lives Clooneys unhappy son tired of being shuffled around the world; Wrights alcoholic father who keeps showing up on his doorstep. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Gaghans movie doesnt play by conventional Hollywood action-movie rules (when it tries to in one action scene near the end it can sacrifice sense for sensation). This is a movie that sticks its political neck out that throbs with dread paranoia and outrage that doesnt coddle the audience by neatly tying things up. ""Syriana"" demands both an alert mind and a stout heart and not just for its powerfully unpleasant torture scene. Its dark dog-eat-dog vision of the world we live in may give you geopolitical nightmares.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Matt Damon left plays Bryan Woodman and Alexander Siddig plays the ambitious son of a Persian Gulf monarch in ""Syriana."" Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Syriana"" with George Clooney Matt Damon Jeffrey Wright Chris Cooper William Hurt Mazhar Munir Tim Blake Nelson Amanda Peet Christopher Plummer Alexander Siddig. Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan suggested by the book ""See No Evil"" by Robert Baer. 126 minutes. Rated R for violence and language. Several theaters. Watch closely and listen carefully during ""Syriana"" because Stephen Gaghans movie is that rarity a thinking persons drama. And even thinking people might be forgiven for getting a little lost in Gaghans labyrinth a tangled tale of corruption within the global oil industry. Gaghan isnt interested in spelling things out and tying up loose ends. The result is a film that rewards multiple viewings and thoughtful mulling. (Full disclosure Ive watched it twice and remain somewhat puzzled which is actually rather refreshing.) Reminiscent of Gaghans Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Traffic"" ""Syriana"" glides between numerous story lines locations characters and even colors. Director of photography Robert Elswit (whos having a heck of a season; he recently shot the beautiful black-and-white ""Good Night and Good Luck"") finds an icy blue light for corporate conference rooms and a yellowish chill in the heat of the Persian Gulf where monarchs and dealmakers drape themselves in blinding white. The handheld camera surreptitiously captures moments over a shoulder or across a room like a quiet intruder. George Clooney bearded and big-bellied plays Bob Barnes a CIA agent determined to pull off one last job. Hes lived in a web of lies for too long; hes tired his colleagues mistrust him his teenage son (Max Minghella) is indifferent to him. By contrast young Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) bursts with vigor. Hes an up-and-comer at an energy-trading company an American living in Geneva with his picturesque family. His smile is slightly too quick. He knows hes in just a bit over his head and hes working hard to compensate. Jeffrey Wright plays Bennett Holiday an elegant Washington D.C. lawyer who nonetheless knows that he fades into the background. Given the assignment to investigate a merger between two Texas oil companies hes ready to make his mark but is uncomfortable in the schmoozy world of dealmaking. And his present is at odds with his past His alcoholic father (William C. Mitchell) haunts him like a shabby ghost. Across the sea more story lines emerge. The ambitious son (Alexander Siddig) of a Persian Gulf monarch sees himself as a reformer and is thrown into a business relationship with Bryan when a tragedy unexpectedly brings them together. Another father-and-son pair bring a very different perspective two laid-off refinery workers who dream of returning to their native Pakistan. The son Wasim (Mazhar Munir) kicks a soccer ball with a friend while discussing Spider-Man; they might be any pair of American teenagers except for their lack of hope. Rich performances add flavor to this meaty stew Wright Clooney and Damon all are in top form and Siddig has the steely-eyed confidence of a veteran movie star. Chris Cooper as a cheerfully corrupt oil executive and William Hurt as a former CIA agent now happily raking in money as a consultant contribute indelible cameos and Christopher Plummer purrs silkily as Wrights cuff-linked boss. Ultimately though ""Syriana"" is a thriller and its final scenes take on a tense suspense as Alexandre Depslats score shimmers alluringly in the background like a desert mirage. We leave ""Syriana"" dazed confused and troubled. These stories seemingly have no end.

Starring George Clooney Matt Damon Jeffrey Wright Amanda Peet Christopher Plummer and Chris Cooper. Written and directed by Stephen Gaghan. (R. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new political thriller ""Syriana"" whirls around the world like a Cooks tour on amphetamines bouncing back and forth from Beirut Kazakhstan Geneva and Marbella to Houston and Langley Va. home of the CIA. With each move a line flashes onscreen identifying the new locale. A similar device might have helped keep the dizzying array of characters straight. When a lumbering George Clooney first appears as Bob Barnes we could use a tag saying that hes a CIA operative whos lost his cool from being left out in the cold too long and as his expanding waistline attests needs to stop gorging on French fries. For Matt Damon it could read opportunistic energy expert who backs a reform-minded member of a royal family in an oil-rich Persian Gulf country instead of his malleable idiot brother the favorite of American business interests. ""Syriana"" is the kind of serious-minded project one is predisposed to embrace especially those who believe the U.S. government is engaged in a devious partnership with conglomerates to dominate the world. The film whose unusual title is a term concocted by Washington think tanks for their dream reshaping of the Middle East addresses hot-button topics such as intense competition for global oil and shady deals made by American companies to get their mitts on it. Thats a lot to present dramatically and its an effort to follow the labyrinthine plot about a Texas petroleum company negotiating a merger with another energy giant to lay claim to gushers in the sand and squeeze out the Chinese. Or something like that. Its hard to get passionately swept away by a movie when youre struggling continually to figure out whos doing what to whom and why. Related Stories Whirlwind of confusion in thriller Syriana Multiple players in the grab for oil are introduced in rapid succession and their connection to one another purposely kept vague. ""Traffic"" used a similar technique examining the drug trade from numerous vantage points. Both movies were written by Stephen Gaghan. The difference is that Steven Soderbergh directed the far superior ""Traffic"" clearing up the congestion caused by too many characters piling up at once. He took the time from the outset to develop the principals as human beings so that their actions mattered. This time Gaghan directed his script himself and the human touch is sorely missing. It takes far too long to grasp the motivations of the numerous figments of his fertile imagination. (A real CIA agent was the inspiration for Barnes but the film comes with a disclaimer saying the events depicted are pure fiction.) The bad guys are obviously rather too much so Texas oilmen and an extremely high-placed Washington attorney (played with malicious gusto by Christopher Plummer) whose authority to determine international policy goes unchallenged. But who are their opposites -- the ones were meant to empathize with? The spy Barnes comes closest to winning you over looking out through melancholy eyes that have seen too much. Clooney puts his all including an additional 35 pounds he packed on for the role into creating a believable relic from the past a spook out of John le Carre. There are veiled references to Barnes exploits in Beirut in the 1980s. But the new CIA doesnt know what to do with him and his old-school methods. Clooneys hunched posture -- indeed his entire being -- indicate someone who knows his days are numbered and his Barnes for whom actions have always taken precedence over words is especially touching in an attempt to communicate these feelings to his college-age son. Fathers and sons are a leitmotif running through ""Syriana"" to the point where you wonder if this mythical land shares Chinas bias against daughters. There are warm family scenes of Damons hyped-up energy guru and Amanda Peet as his wife breakfasting with their young boys a prelude to a family disaster. Jeffrey Wright as an up-and-coming lawyer smoothing the way for the oil merger reveals his characters failings in his inability to deal with his alcoholic father. A close tie between a Pakistani father and son is severed when the migrant workers lose their jobs in an oil field and the son becomes a religious fanatic. Meanwhile an aging emir must decide which of his two boys will run the country. In one of the films few funny moments Chris Cooper giving another spot-on performance as a self-important oil company owner inquires during a meeting ""Whats an emir?"" The misunderstanding among countries and cultures is one of many themes Gaghan touches on without shedding much light. On the other hand ace cinematographer Robert Elswit does a splendid job illuminating the Middle Eastern landscape proving again the advantage of shooting on location. The vast stretches of desert recalled from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are shown broken up by oil fields and emerging cities. Its startling to see the number of skyscrapers that appear to sprout out of sand. ""Syriana"" has the feel of a documentary with bits of information parceled out by an assortment of experts. Youre not meant to care about talking heads. But a movie is in trouble when you leave it with little feeling or understanding for the characters youve spent time with. -- Advisory This film contains numerous violent scenes.

"Complexities fuel the new oil order - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Christopher Plummer Complexities fuel the new oil ordermovies - review`Syriana is an unflinching look at how the world works and how petroleum is the keyDecember 9 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticIts Big Oils world. Were all just driving around in it. And air-conditioning Tivo-watching iPod-ing and Googling in it.If you hadnt figured that all out here is Syriana a searing bleak and unflinching thriller that embraces the big picture even as it zeroes in on several small ones. Stephen Gaghans densely scripted magnificently shot and ably acted take on American Middle East policy has everything in it but Israel.Israel doesnt count. Israel doesnt have oil.George Clooney stars as Bob Barnes a CIA veteran of Beirut and Tehran whos a bit concerned about some shoulder-launched missiles that his government has lost track of. He writes memos and that rocks the boat.Theres a big oil merger that might have involved some chicanery by the moguls who engineered it -- Chris Cooper Robert Foxworth and Tim Blake Nelson. Jeffrey Wright is an attorney commissioned by his power-broker boss (Christopher Plummer) to find the illegalities in the deal before the government does.Matt Damon is an energy analyst eager to broker a deal in which his company advises an oil kingdom about to be run by Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig).And a Pakistani teenager (Mazhar Munir) is among many who have just been laid off from their Persian Gulf oil refinery jobs in a Chinese takeover of their firm. Poor oppressed by foreigners and their own government they are ripe for recruitment by the forces of extremism that America is ostensibly most concerned about.The bit players are just sacrificial pawns in a sprawling chess board that big D.C. attorneys Texas barons and their government lackeys are manipulating. Barnes will face his darkest hour Damons analyst will cynically turn tragedy into personal gain Wrights attorney will have to resolve how to skate through the corruption pouring in on him.And the Pakistani teen will have to decide if self-sacrifice is really the only way to get the worlds attention.Gaghans script brilliantly plays with our sympathies and expectations setting up heroes and villains and then surprising us as we change our perspective. You may have heard that suicide bombers get a sympathetic treatment here. But Gaghan also lets us see that yes these crooked oil guys do have American interests at heart. If we get the oil and the Chinese dont then we get to cling to the top rung of the ladder just a little bit longer.Damons character is cynical but willing to speak truth to power. He may preach high hopes for his new oil sheik clients. But in private? Theyre just men dressed in spotless white sheets. And what message does that attire send?""Its hot and I dont have to work.""Wrights attorney has to balance his investigation against fears that he may be somebodys patsy. And he has to spend too much time with the most ruthless and unscrupulous wheeler-dealers Texas has to offer.""Corruption"" one (Nelson) bellows ""keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why we win""The movie is an embarrassment of good character actors with players such as Jamey Sheridan William Hurt Amanda Peet (as Damons wife) and David Clennon showing up for showy small turns. Its a triumph of style with scenes of overexposed over-lit Arabia contrasted with the limos offices and ranches of America where the strings are pulled.Syriana is a Traffic of the oil trade a J.F.K. of current American Middle East policy full of conspiratorially oily relationships simplistic policies and cold-blooded murders tangled up in an untidy story of the way things really work.Syriana is complex engrossing involving and depressing. Difficult to absorb it is also difficult to accept and it is one of the best films of 2005.

Not the politics which are what they are whether left-wing or right-wing anti-business or laissez-faire. A movie that swings hard in one direction or another is just a movie with a point of view and points of view are the currency of film. At the box office we vote with our wallets after all. So Syriana happens to have a dark view of oil companies and U.S.-Arab relations. It has grim things to say about the global flow of money and petroleum. It portrays bureaucrats and businessmen as detestably venal so much so that two suicide bombers and a CIA assassin wind up as the films most sympathetic characters. However you feel about such notions you wont leave the theater happy -- impressed perhaps by the intellect and intensity of the film; depressed perhaps by the futility it conveys; relieved perhaps that its over. And confused. Youll feel confused. Thats the problem with Syriana. Stephen Gaghans movie bears no deficit of talent or ideas and anyone who longs for sophisticated craftsmanship may embrace its murkiness as a nice change from the pyrotechnic simplicity that passes for storytelling in a lot of films these days. It doesnt talk down to movie goers. It asks them to reach instead. Theres also undeniable logic in making the Middle Eastern oil trade seem as incomprehensible and chaotic onscreen as it is (one can only assume) in life; this may be intentional. But I had the same thought watching Syriana I often have while reading up on the subject which is I wish I were smarter then I might actually get some of this stuff. The higher-level thinking at play in this purposely obscure film invites scholarly hosannas but dilutes its emotional impact putting the audience at a remove. By saying ""You shouldnt understand"" Gaghans film comes uncomfortably close to saying ""You shouldnt care."" That we care at all is a testament to the acting prowess of some cast members (a viciously genteel Christopher Plummer) and innate likability of others (a bearded and plump George Clooney) who draw us into a multi-tentacled story about power shifts in an oil-rich Arab nation and Americans who jockey for influence. Clooney plays Bob Barnes a CIA operative based loosely on author Robert Baer whose book See No Evil inspired Gaghans screenplay. At the films start Barnes is in Tehran delivering two missiles that quickly part ways. By films end both have detonated and Barnes has been gagged kidnapped tortured disillusioned and made a scapegoat. As Gaghan did with his script for Traffic -- an equally complex but more visceral and engrossing film -- he threads characters and storylines into a dense weave of sociopolitical observations tinged with fatalism. There are oil execs (Chris Cooper Peter Gerety) preparing a merger. There are lawyers (Nicky Henson Jeffrey Wright) hired by the Justice Department to investigate. Theres an ailing Gulf-nation emir (Nadim Sawalha) with two sons (Alexander Siddig Akbar Kurtha) one a reformer one a puppet who struggle to inherit their countrys rule. And theres a laid-off oil worker (Shahid Ahmed) with a drifting son (Mazhar Munir) who turns to militant Islam. A father-son motif runs through the film and rattles it with a few true shocks of heartache. But Gaghan never dwells on pathos using the human element merely to prop up the Byzantine architecture of his story. Syriana is an ambitious edifice built with conviction and skill. But Im not sure I understand it and Im not sure I care. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Refurb Samsung 55"" 4K LED LCD UHD Smart TV for 550 + free...

Matt Damon is an oil analyst offering his daily quote to the voracious sound-bite hounds of CNN and admonishes everyone to remember that ""theres a 10-12 instability premium in the market."" Meaning Chaos is good for oil companies to the tune of a 10-spot per barrel. Some of their profits will be spent at the CIA on Capitol Hill or the streets of Beirut to guarantee further chaos. Meaning ""Syriana"" loves to illuminate obfuscate and adjudicate the political world with its own evolving jargon. Damons character ends up with a 75 million profit from a particularly personal form of ""instability."" Listen carefully to the words of ""Syriana"" but dont trust a single one before considering the source. ""Syriana"" is a fascinating movie - and a substantive and thought-provoking one - but it does not necessarily attain greatness. Employing many of the same people and techniques as its close ancestor ""Traffic"" it leaves the same depressing burnt-out aftertaste. Yes it has taught us a lot. But did we learn anything? Writer-director Stephen Gaghan who wrote the ""Traffic"" script for Steven Soderbergh launches multiple story lines and a dozen important characters then slowly brings them together for a literally explosive finish. Just when were sure Gaghan has lost track of his threads we find ourselves cringing from a finale that seems suddenly inevitable. All slimy trails lead back to Connex a fictional multinational oil company manipulating world events to smooth its mergers and acquisitions. George Clooney is a lifelong CIA operative who executes two Iranian arms dealers on behalf of his government yet his next assignment seems suspiciously in line with the interests of Connex. And that Iranian job left an extra black market missile floating around As Chekhov would surely remind us you can bet that a missile launched in Act 1 will acquire a target by Act III. Damon lives a good life parsing the oil business in Switzerland but a family tragedy opens him up to new possibilities of both bribery and revolution. Jeffrey Wright is assigned to ""investigate"" a Connex merger but only deep enough to toss minor dirty players to regulators and protect his bosses. The Arab portion of the complex equation is represented by Alexander Siddig an emirs son who promises populist reform if he ascends the throne and Mazhar Munir a migrant oil worker fired from his job who finds sustenance and soul mates in a radical Muslim school. Gaghan has said he meant to portray a world where there are no good guys and no bad guys. Hes telling half the truth - there certainly are no good guys. Maybe one and we know hes doomed. This is the flaw of ""Syriana"" to place everyone inside the movie and everyone watching it at the same level of guilt. Yes I buy into something when I put 2 gas into my oversized car; but that does not give me the same responsibility as the chairman of a global oil company or an Arab emir or a CIA directorate. The style of ""Syriana"" and ""Traffic"" is to make us feel equally culpable and therefore equally powerless when the very fact a movie like this can be made into popular entertainment shows that change is possible. Gaghan delights in language and excels at putting the right words in his characters mouths. A CIA bureaucrat tells Clooney they could ""utilize his skill sets"" which involve blowing things up. A beguiling Muslim teacher in the madrassa tells his radicals ""The pain of modern life cannot be solved by deregulation or lower taxes."" Loyalty is the only word foreign to Gaghan and his stable of movie operatives. Those naive enough to expect loyalty including those of us in the audience are kicked in the guts every few minutes. We have little time to breathe as the geo-political machinery of the oil business moves ever forward fueled by the renewable resource of avarice and malice. So many wonderful actors show up for small parts in ""Syriana"" we can be distracted from noticing the scenes they are dropped into seem forced. Gaghan has terrifically biting things to say (""Corruption keeps us safe and warm"") but has people like Tim Blake Nelson say them in the oddest settings. But Clooney among others deserves credit for how far he went to make us forget hes George Clooney so that wed pay attention to other things. Here he is fat and broken and confused good at what he does without any clue why hes doing it. Compliments to the makers of ""Syriana"" for leaving in so many scenes and so many lines that must have made their backers squirm. Tough as it is to hear we should all squirm for our own part in this fine mess.

"Teeming Syriana weaves absorbing ominous tapestry - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Teeming Syriana weaves absorbing ominous tapestry By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 9 2005 (Correction Because of a reporting error the Dec. 9 film review of Syriana"" misspelled the surname of actor Alexander Siddig.)Stephen Gaghans Syriana"" flies into theaters praised as a rarity Hollywood doesnt make movies like this anymore. By like this"" those of us who appreciate Gaghans movie mean intelligent"" political"" incensed"" timely"" and appropriately cynical."" And by anymore"" we mean since the 1970s. Syriana"" is about something very specific -- oil. Which is to say that actually its about everything.This was also true of Steven Soderberghs drug saga Traffic"" which Gaghan wrote as well. Syriana"" loosely based on former CIA agent Robert Baers 2002 memoir See No Evil"" assumes the same storytelling model as Traffic"" only more ambitiously with individual stories woven into a larger thesis. This new film also has a super-size wanderlust The film is set in Geneva the Persian Gulf the Department of Justice Texas ranches the French Riviera the Maryland suburbs and Gaghans unnamed Persian Gulf emirate.The leadership of that country is yet to be determined. The current emir has two sons groomed to succeed him as king. One Meshal (Akbar Kurtha) is a priss and a yes man. The other Nasir (Alexander Saddig) is a more natural-born leader whos repulsed by his familys obeisance to America and its wishes for the countrys natural gas. He wants to right his nations squandered promise and be a reformer.As a start Nasir has just kicked out the Americans and handed over the drilling rights to a Chinese company which leaves the previous drillers a Houston outfit called Connex in a fix. Connex decides its going to merge with Killen a smaller Texas oil company which Connex finds attractive because its about to start drilling for oil in Kazakhstan. Washington has to approve the merger and to ensure that it goes smoothly the companies hire an intimidating D.C. law firm to find and fix any potential roadblocks. The job falls to a taciturn lawyer named Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright). Were told what Bennett might be capable of when Christopher Plummer haughty as ever playing Bennetts boss says that he might be a lion whos been mistaken for a lamb.Syriana"" is big on lambs ideally of the sacrificial sort -- even when they look like teddy bears as a tubby and grizzled George Clooney does. He plays Bob Barnes a loyal veteran CIA agent whose latest assignment involves arranging a pivotal assassination.As is perhaps evident Syriana"" is a crowded movie. Bob is a fascinating character but his development suffers at the hands of the greater story. The film has another intriguing plot involving Wasim (Mazhar Munir) a Pakistani kid left idle and facing deportation from the Gulf after hes laid off from the drilling fields when the Chinese step into the picture. Unmoored and uncertain hes seduced by the prospect of terrorism.Gaghans script practically chokes on people like Wasim who never emerge as complete characters. Everyone represents a position. The movie might have worked even better had it been a miniseries that could have more deeply developed the folks caught in the storys gears. Gaghan is thinking globally yet not acting locally enough.Take the Woodmans an American couple played by Matt Damon and Amanda Peet living in Geneva. Their young son drowns at a party for the emir and this entire area of Syriana"" is meant to function as its emotional compass. Damons character Bryan winds up using the childs death to win business with Nasir but when the movies over you come to feel that the Woodman family is here only to yank our heartstrings.Elsewhere Gaghan tries to find a tie that binds the men in the film and comes up with fractured father-son relations meant presumably to resonate all the way to the current Bush White House. In the films hokiest such relationship Bennett cant get through his front door without climbing over his drunk daddy.Still in its seriousness Syriana"" has an absorbing ominous roundness that plays even better with a second viewing. The plots come rather inexorably to a head. These events arent presented as the side effects of paranoia. They ring scarily true. If the film isnt fair (it leans left and the oil people are often comically heartless) it does achieve a kind of balance. Gaghan has written the baddies so that their righteousness isnt hollow. The runaway corruption (the Oil Man of the Year awards) almost makes sense.In fact the most disturbing quality of Syriana"" is how rational it seems.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

In America more often than not we get the fever dreams of Oliver Stone.Usually however the field lies fallow. During Vietnam and for an unconscionably long time afterward Hollywood did nothing to confront explicitly the agonizing issues of that war. The current situation in Iraq and the Middle East has so far been dealt with mostly in the bullheaded Michael Moore manner. Hollywood has yet to dive into the turmoil and surface with something that survives as more than just agitprop politicking.A lot of people have held out high hopes for ""Syriana"" a vast mosaic of a movie about Big Oil written and directed by Stephen Gaghan Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""Traffic."" Its star and coexecutive producer George Clooney has been tantalizingly forthright "" Syriana ... opens discussions about corruption about the effectiveness of the CIA about any number of things"" he said in studio press notes. ""You want people to be standing around the water cooler the next day talking about it saying Heres what I agree with or Heres where theyre wrong. "" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But the discussion most people will likely be having is more along the lines of ""Could you figure out what was going on?"" With its multiple crisscrossing plots ""Syriana"" falls down at the most basic storytelling level and this incoherence damages even the good parts. Im not saying that Gaghan should have tied everything up into a neat little bundle - that would be ludicrous when dramatizing a situation as volatile as the current one in the Middle East. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But the confusions in this movie should not be mistaken for the passionate chaos of creativity. Bad exposition is more like it.Even when its clear what is going on ""Syriana"" doesnt exactly rip the lid off high-level criminality in our time. Gaghan has his Oliver Stone side His clarion call is issued with a bullhorn. Is it really breaking news that corporations - of whatever stripe - are fiercely even lethally competitive? There is even the obligatory greed-is-good speech delivered here as a litany by a Texas oilman (Tim Blake Nelson) facing prosecution ""Corruption is our protection.... Corruption keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why we win.""Gaghan comes on like a heavyweight but hes wearing kid gloves. In this movie where so much is at stake in the Middle East Israel goes virtually unmentioned. Gaghan doesnt go after any real-life Washington muckety-mucks; his condemnations are comfortably generic.The central story line in ""Syriana"" involves the prospective merger of two American oil companies against the backdrop of a reformist Persian Gulf prince (the hyper-elegant Alexander Siddig) who has sold drilling rights to the Chinese. Clooneys Bob Barnes is the veteran CIA operative who in his final undercover mission is sent to assassinate him. Matt Damon is the Geneva-based energy analyst who cozies up to the prince. Jeffrey Wright plays an attorney finessing the oil company merger for a big-ticket Washington law firm with deep ties to Big Oil. (The firm is headed by Christopher Plummer at his most imperially smarmy.) As a sideshow a Pakistani father (Shahid Ahmed) and son (Mazhar Munir) working the princes oil fields are laid off because of the China deal pushing the son into terrorism.Any of these story lines could have been expanded into a single worthy movie. (And judging from the disjointedness of the narrative probably a lot of filmed material was left out). But what we are left with are at best tantalizing shards.The most glittering of these shards is the Bob Barnes subplot. The spy who is left out in the cold is by now a stock figure but Clooney invests him with a rugged poignancy. Barnes is a late-blooming do-gooder in a bad world and he pays the price for it. When he is cut off so is the movie. Grade B- Rated R for violence and language. Next up Culture Cafe Damon joining Clooney in The Monuments Men?

Seldom have form content and cultural sensibility been so excitably aligned as in this fascinating exasperating film about the unholy marriage of power politics and global business. Gaghan who last rattled our bones with his Oscar-winning screenplay for Steven Soderberghs international drug-trade thriller Traffic again whirls us around the worlds political hot spots repeatedly yanking us back home to witness the lethal antics of American power brokers in pursuit of the rapidly depleting commodity that has led us into gratuitous wars and dubious alliances with nasty regimes -- and Gaghan implies brought terror to our doorsteps. Syriana does for oil what Traffic did for drugs -- lays it squarely in the laps of the damn Yanks. As a director Gaghan has soaked up much of his skittish shooting style from Soderbergh. Like Traffic Syriana which was executive-produced by Soderbergh and George Clooneys Section Eight production company is filmed with hand-held cameras and copious cutting between short staccato scenes. But its a glossier more panoramic affair -- the cinematographer is Robert Elswit who shot Clooneys urbane Good Night and Good Luck -- that switches giddily if Im keeping score right between the corridors of power in Washington D.C. the oil fields of Kazakhstan Tehrans criminal underworld an unidentified oil-rich Persian Gulf state and a five-star Arab-owned resort in sunny Spain. Gaghan who has knocked about the world a bit himself unleashes an indigestible cast of characters who range from the shamelessly power-mad (corporate fat cats lawyers oil sheiks government higher-ups and other shadowy figures) to the desperately powerless (itinerant workers trawling the Middle East for hardscrabble oil-field labor) with a few unfortunates bearing opaque job titles caught in the middle. All but lost in the crowd is Bob Barnes (Clooney deglamorized again and loving it) a mid-level CIA agent loosely based on Robert Baer whose memoir See No Evil inspired the movie. Chubby and rumpled in an elderly windbreaker his features buried in a shaggy full beard Bob works the frontline of international espionage a faceless blender-in among Iranian arms dealers and Islamic fundamentalists in a world where exploding cars and backroom torture come with the territory. In the fine old tradition of movie snoops Bobs private life is a shambles. Hes estranged from his wife and barely available to his college-bound son (Max Minghella). Even on the job he cuts an anachronistic figure in a downsized remote-control CIA where ""intelligence"" is picked up via Internet chatter and ""intervention"" takes the form of long-range missiles tracked by computer from gleaming high-rise offices in Washington to the desert dunes of the Middle East. But Bobs greatest weakness shines out of his soulful brown eyes. Hes a believer -- a man who thinks hes serving his country -- which makes him a quaint if twisted idealist in a system that scorns idealists as losers. We get the heroes we deserve I guess Bob is an assassin whose final assignment before he gets kicked upstairs to a cushy desk job is to bump off Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) heir apparent to the throne of the unnamed Gulf State and a reformer who wants to stop selling oil cheap to the Americans because the Chinese will pay top dollar allowing him to revitalize his countrys ailing economic infrastructure. When the job is aborted Bob is brutally brought to understand that his superiors have been deceiving him for years about the true purpose of his activities. Lest you fear this is not enough plot great chunks of Syriana are given over to the machinations of creepy Beltway bedfellows with corporate types consistently trumping the pols as they forge uneasy mergers and jockey for hegemony over Middle East oil. Gaghans screenplay is crisp and sassy; his writing has the fierce clarity and erudition of the self-taught intellectual. Still its hard to give individual life to a cast of characters this big without flattening them into types. Flawlessly played though they are by among others Christopher Plummer Matt Damon William Hurt Chris Cooper and Viola Davis (a vinegary stitch as a Condi-like deputy national security adviser) they come off as a quietly insidious but undifferentiated lot mere mouthpieces for the various arms of evil empire and its hapless discontents. Perhaps the homogenization of the corporate-political nexus is the whole point here but from a dramatic standpoint theres something bloodless and uninvolving about Syrianas Quiet Americans. Gaghan draws his Arab characters with a more discriminating intelligence and in a lumbering effort to breathe emotional life into the movie peppers the action with parallel father-son dramas that cut across lines of race class and geography. It may be a liberal indulgence that Syriana offers us more sympathetic Arab power brokers than it does good American ones. For one thing we dont hear too much about Persian Gulf heads of state who are bursting with zeal for democratic reform. For another the movie is disturbingly dewy-eyed about suicide bombers by no means all of whom are alienated children of poverty and discrimination. Still as movies go its a breath of fresh air to see any Arabs at all positively depicted. And given the almost daily revelations about covert operations in the CIA and the cozy relations between the Bush administration and the multinationals its hard to argue with Gaghans central thesis that America has the most to answer for in the current bloody war between East and West. If Syriana seems fashionably up-to-the-minute in putting its finger on post-9/11 anxieties its style and sensibility hark back to the paranoid moviemaking of the early 1970s. The stage has grown more global the players more far-flung the technology of war more friendly to special effects. But the song -- the crushing of idealism however tainted by heedless powermongers -- remains the same. Its not just the skittering style of Syriana that gives you the jitters but the image of a world where the separation of powers has become a bitter joke. Gaghan condemns it but he also gets off on all the power plays. More troubling yet is that I cant tell whether Syriana is a deeply pessimistic movie or a deeply cynical one. Politically and morally theres a critical difference. For if pessimism of the intellect can always cohabit with optimism of the will cynicism is its own dead end.SYRIANA | Written and directed by STEPHEN GAGHAN based on the book See No Evil The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIAs War on Terrorism Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Syriana Glen Wilson) B- Syriana Genre Mystery and Thriller; Starring George Clooney Matt Damon Amanda Peet Alexander Siddig; Director Stephen Gaghan; Author Robert Baer Stephen Gaghan; Release Date Limited 11/23/2005; Release Date Wide 12/09/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 126; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 23 2005 -- 1200 AM EST Syriana has a lot of big important things to say about big important things and it says them with a sense of urgency. This dense talky proudly complicated adult drama of geopolitical intrigue weighs in on the amoral realities of covert CIA operations Middle Eastern politics global oil business and U.S. government antitrust investigations -- the whole military-industrial ball of wax. Indeed the point of Syriana appears to be that the whole lousy corrupt oil-producing and -consuming world is a ball of wax ready to melt. The movie tells interrelated stories in knotted loops of simultaneity and jagged shards of documentary-style realism with conspiracy on its mind and the piecemeal structure of Traffic as its screenwriting template in good part because Stephen Gaghan who wrote the Oscar-winning Traffic script for Steven Soderbergh here writes and directs too. Its as earnestly politically left-leaning as Jarhead is coyly apolitical; its also the kind of movie that requires a viewer to work actively for comprehension and to chalk up any lack of same to his or her own deficiency in the face of something so evidently smart. But while Im all for political dramas that take stands rather than feign neutrality what Syriana forgets to provide is the one thing that makes any movie however difficult easy to love emotional empathy. Like the title itself -- think-tank talk for a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East -- this is a working paper of ideas driven by hypothesis rather than a compelling drama driven by compassion. And while those with an eye for vast left-wing conspiracies are welcome to believe that Gaghan planned all along to make a movie shaped like a big-picture that fails to take into account small-picture human needs I am not one of those conspiracy junkies; I think the absence of soul is just the filmmakers big gaffe. Consider George Clooney as Bob Barnes a veteran CIA man who serves as one of the character tentpoles of Gaghans construction. Bobs got the thickened gut of a middle-aged company spook slowed down by years of routine (even if the routine involves assassination) and Clooney who grew his own morose gut and beard for the part is nothing if not generous in his habitation of such a shady yet loyal freewheeling yet lonely man. (The actors commitment to politically engaged movies in this as well as Good Night and Good Luck is one of the most effective uses of his well-earned stardom.) But for all we see of Bob we know nothing at all about the guy except that having been arbitrarily double-crossed by a field contact during the course of a mission he now finds himself just as arbitrarily made a scapegoat by his own CIA handlers who want to distance themselves from such a liability. We watch Matt Damon as an open-faced go-getter of an energy analyst negotiate business with a Middle Eastern prince (Alexander Siddig) and Jeffrey Wright as a Washington attorney work on a merger between two American oil companies and theres no reason given for the double-dealing power plays and American capitalist thuggery that shape the landscape. (What little humanity this trio of clueless overmatched American men retains is conferred by fleeting interaction with kin; in the case of Wrights ambitious lawyer his private burden is an embarrassing drinking bum of a father. And he handles the old man with much the same distraction shown by Michael Douglas as a drug czar with an addicted daughter in Traffic.) The same schematic shorthand goes by the way for the Middle Easterners involved who are less fallible men tripped up by the modern (and specifically American) world than walking position statements corrupt Gulf-country prince backed by American oilmen versus his reform-minded brother or long-suffering migrant Pakistani oil worker versus his angry son recruited by nuclear-weapon-toting extremists. Syriana makes a point of circling the globe with scenes shot in Geneva Dubai London etc. -- its a picture that displays datelines as a show of geopolitical bustle. And the speeches of even the most passing players are honed to draw blood -- Chris Cooper as a scheming oilman Christopher Plummer as the head of a powerful law firm Amanda Peet in a slicing performance as Damons distressed wife. But what do those speeches say? They say Were talking about big important things so pay attention -- and then make it a challenge to do so. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Supporting Actor (George Clooney); Best Original Screenplay (Stephen Gaghan) Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Watch Kelly Clarkson adorably forget the lyrics to her songs Katy Perry reveals which line of her DNC speech Orlando Bloom wrote Chandra Levy miniseries in works at TNT Nick Jonas Demi Lovato send fans on scavenger hunt for concert tickets Pokemon Go nests are reportedly spawning different Pokemon Disney changes Avengers Infinity War Part 1 title Constance Wu says Matt Damons Great Wall perpetuates racist myth Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

Its a global portrait of danger deception and disillusionment with no dearth of human casualties. See no evil George Clooney plays a CIA operative in the Middle East who betrayed by the agency realizes he has been a dupe. Warner Bros. Pictures The storytelling style is multilayered and challenging with several plot threads interwoven all dealing with the politics of oil. The movie zigs and zags and requires close attention to catch every twist and turn. A heavier-than-usual hirsute George Clooney is a CIA agent whose assignments in Lebanon and Iran are not what they seem. His world-weary but heroic agency veteran is the emotional center of the film. Clooney does a masterful job portraying a smart guy who knows he should probably take a desk job in D.C. but is hooked on the adrenaline rush of top-secret overseas assignments. Matt Damon artfully plays an ambitious energy analyst based in Geneva who becomes the confidant of an oil-rich Arab prince. The principled reform-minded Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) has given natural-gas drilling rights to a Chinese corporation striking a serious blow to Connex a huge Texas energy company. Jeffrey Wright plays a corporate lawyer with some conscience working for a powerful law firm that lacks it. ""Were looking for the illusion of due diligence"" his superiors tell him referring to his assignment guiding a merger between giant Connex and Killen a smaller American oil company. Chris Cooper plays a good ol boy turned CEO of Killen Corp. Hes a self-made Texas oil billionaire who keeps exotic animals on his ranch for hunting. Worlds away from the wheeling dealing and corruption the life of a young Pakistani migrant worker (an excellent Mazhar Munir) unfolds as he loses his job in an oil field and is recruited by a Muslim extremist in a fatalistic but poignant story line. Writer/director Stephen Gaghan who won a screenplay Oscar for his equally probing drug-trade saga Traffic has fashioned an uncommonly intelligent story inspired by CIA agent Robert Baers memoir See No Evil. Gaghan assumes his audience is smart enough to follow his explosive tour of global petro-politics. The result is thought-provoking and unnerving emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating. Gaghan shakes us up and prompts us to question world policies -- without preaching or dumbing down intricate economic and political realities. We need more movies like this.

"Syriana | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; syriana ) Syriana (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli You may have to look long and hard to find a 2005 movie with as cynical an outlook on global politics as Syriana. Sadly this is a situation when the cynicism is understandable. In addition to painting a bleak picture Syriana makes no concessions to impatient audiences or viewers with short attention spans. The density of narrative is remarkable considering the Hollywood trend toward simplification. This movie is plot-driven from start to finish and it needs all 126 minutes to tell the whole story. It takes approximately three-quarters of that time before we see the pattern as more than just a random interweaving of threads. Give up on or lose track of Syriana and the payoff wont be as forceful. The relationship between the arms industry and the armed forces is often referred to as the ""military-industrial complex"" (a term coined in one of President Eisenhowers last speeches to the nation). The general thinking is that the militarys need to amass the newest and best weapons keeps the economy going and positively impacts the health of thousands of American corporations. But the reality at least as depicted in Syriana is more complicated. Its not just that the need for a strong economy demands a strong military but that the greed and influence of Big Business (especially the oil industry) sets policy. The relationship between major corporations and the government isnt incestuous because the politicians are pawns not bedfellows. Government doesnt do whats best for the people; it does whats best for Big Business with enough occasional misdirection grandstanding and sleight of hand to dupe the voters into believing theyre in charge. Ultimately its not a question of Democrats or Republicans - both are controlled by the same underlying forces. This is Syrianas thesis and it stands the test of being applied to todays real-world global politics. Syriana is not non-fiction. It has been ""suggested"" by Robert Baers factual See No Evil The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIAs War on Terrorism but writer/director Stephen Gaghan (who wrote Traffic) uses Baers book as a starting point. Although the story applies real-world parallels it is made-up. But that doesnt lessen its impact or its capacity to generate discussion. Most depressing of all may be Syrianas conclusion that the problem has become so deeply rooted that nothing can dislodge it. Cynical or realistic? Sometimes its hard to differentiate. Providing a synopsis of Syriana would be an exercise in futility. The film is too complex for that. Instead Ill provide an encapsulation of the set-up. There are three major strands to the plot. The first involves a long-time Middle East CIA operative Bob Barnes (George Clooney) who is cut loose by the government as soon as he becomes a liability. (You didnt think the government was loyal to its employees?) The second focuses on the merger of two major American oil companies Connex and Killen. Killen is the lesser of the giants but it has acquired drilling rights in Kazakhstan that make it an attractive partner. Chris Cooper plays the CEO of Killen and Jeffrey Wright is a lawyer brought in to investigate the proposed merger. Finally theres Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander Siddig) the next-in-line to become Emir of an unnamed oil-rich country. Prince Nasir is reform-minded and believes that what is best for his people is not knuckling under to the United States. He intends to get value for his countrys oil and this makes him unpopular amongst those with real power. The structure of Syriana has similarities to Traffic and thats unsurprising considering that Gaghan penned both scripts. Each includes large numbers of characters gradually moving on a semi-collision course. The setup is long and a little laborious but its necessary. This is Gaghans second directorial outing (his debut was 2002s Abandon). Unlike Steven Soderbergh who helmed Traffic (and serves as an Executive Producer on this film) Gaghan shies away from visual flourishes. As a result Syriana has what can best be described as a traditional or ""straightforward"" look and feel. The cast is a mix of A-list actors and relative unknowns and there isnt a weak performance to be found. Even those often thought of as light-weights such as Matt Damon and Amanda Peet (playing an American ""energy analyst"" and his wife) have been given roles in which they can shine. The brightest lights are George Clooney Jeffrey Wright and Alexander Siddig all of whom deserve recognition (if not by the Academy then by those who see this film). Clooney steps outside his usual image sporting a scruffy beard and having gained 35 pounds. This is not an heroic role but he does whats required and it may open eyes. Wright approaches his part in a low-key manner but theres a coldness and urgency to the portrayal that we dont fully understand until the film is nearly over. Siddig who cut his teeth in the TV series Star Trek Deep Space Nine and was impressive earlier this year in Kingdom of Heaven makes Prince Nasir into a charismatic and determined individual. Actors like Chris Cooper Christopher Plummer and William Hurt have smaller but not necessarily less important parts. Syriana will be a polarizing motion picture pitting defenders of the establishment against those on the other side. Some will declare that its the first movie to dare to tell the truth. Others will blast it as liberal propaganda dreamed up by conspiracy theorists. Either way its an intensely fascinating look behind a curtain where few of us feel comfortable enough to peer. And one doesnt have to agree with Gaghans conclusions to be swept along by Syrianas dramatic momentum. I believe that much of Oliver Stones JFK is well constructed fiction but that doesnt prevent it from being compelling and a source of endless speculation and interest. Syriana is an adult motion picture made with mature viewers in mind. It contains elements of a thriller but isnt one in a traditional sense. There is no instant gratification. The film challenges its audience and forces them to make their own determinations about the validity of what it proposes. Its a wake-up call. In todays environment its a rare thing to find a movie with interesting characters in dense intelligent storylines but thats what Syriana offers. It is one of the best films of 2005.

Those complaining that Hollywood never turns out films of topical or political substance are likely to embrace ""Syriana"" a weighty and deeply intriguing look at the many-tentacled beast that is the international oil industry. Wide-ranging and restlessly probing Stephen Gaghans second directorial effort uses the same mosaic storytelling technique as in his Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Traffic"" to create a revealing portrait of diverse forces contributing to global tension particularly concerning the Middle East. Terse understated and sometimes confusing this is the rare film that could actually benefit from being significantly longer. Warner Bros. release will become a must-see for thinking audiences and make inroads with the wider public thanks to star names and certain critical acclaim. Globe-trotting as stealthily as did exec producer Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans Twelve"" but with rather more seriousness of intent Gaghan plunges straight past the received versions of contemporary events to open up a vast range of inquiry that encompasses everyone from oil industry titans and CIA ops to disenfranchised Pakistani workers and a Beirut godfather of Hezbollah. Underexplaining sometimes to a fault pic keeps the viewer straining to keep tabs on the identities relationships and allegiances among the dozens of characters (explanatory titles at least identify locations) but while many post-screening discussions will feature ""Did you get what was going on there?""-type queries the disparate threads come together with undeniable power and reasonable clarity by the end. Its all about those old standbys power and money but the fascination is in the details -- the manipulations betrayals deceit and tragedies the immoral extremes to which true believers (in religion capitalism the principles of government) will go and at what human cost. Analytical and revelatory in nature the film is not designed to elicit rooting interests or a strong emotional pull nor is it didactic or motivated by political point-making. It mainly wants to strip away conventional perceptions to present one closely observed view of what makes the world go round. If theres a chief among equals here its graying bearded portly CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney with 30 extra pounds) whos first seen unloading two sophisticated stinger missiles to a young Iranian in Tehran. Back in the U.S. two petroleum behemoths are about to merge one thats losing its drilling rights in a fictional Gulf state to a higher Chinese bidder the other of which has just snared access to Kazakhstan. Situation in the Gulf nation is delicate since the aging Emir needs to select a successor from between his sophisticated older son Nasir (Alexander Siddig) who favors the Chinese deal and his uncouth younger one Meshal (Akbar Kurtha) whos Yank-friendly. Meanwhile the merger is being assessed by D.C. attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) whose boss Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is a major behind-the-scenes power player in oil and politics. Then theres Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) a Geneva-based energy analyst who becomes deeply involved with Nasir after a terrible accident makes the prince feel indebted to the American. Lurking beneath the radar is young Pakistani oil refinery laborer Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) who with his father is laid off after the Chinese takeover and falls under the sway of a radical Islamic cleric in the Gulf. In laying out the storys underpinnings Gaghan whose prior outing as helmer was the under-realized 2002 suspenser ""Abandon"" takes a terse even cryptic approach that quickly signals youre going to have to stay on your toes to keep up. Only with reluctance does the writer-director supply what normally passes for exposition and he and editor Tim Squyres keep the rhythms tense and the mood off-kilter without resorting to manufactured-feeling suspense cutting. Even when its not entirely clear whats going on the scenes are mostly dramatic and absorbing with a feeling of credibility rooted in the palpably real settings and naturalistic dialogue. When Barnes arrives in Beirut to undertake a hit hes greeted by a Hezbollah welcoming committee that packs him off in a car to meet their boss a serene gent who approves his presence. Before he can do his nasty deed however Barnes is turned on by one of his own and undergoes gruesome fingernail extraction torture (a scene that injured Clooneys own spinal cord) before a last-second reprieve. But its curtains for his CIA career. Frozen out the perennial agency loyalist is forced to extreme measures to reclaim his passports for one more trip to the Middle East. Meanwhile Holiday arranges for a couple of powerful men to take the fall so that the oil merger can go ahead and Woodman accepts guilt money that creates an irreparable rupture with his wife (Amanda Peet). As for Wasim he becomes tempted by the idea of a nonstop ticket to paradise. The richness of detail is immense evincing Gaghans years of research the booze and floozies in Tehran; the parched lives of immigrant workers in the Gulf; the convinced attitudes of members of a Washington-based Committee for the Liberation of Iran; the comparative ways Texans and Arabs wear their oil birthrights; the arguments among Islamic youth about the righteousness of virginity; the competing pulls of modernity and fundamentalism in the Middle East and corruption corruption everywhere. Given the breadth of Gaghans canvas theres a sense that ""Syriana"" may even have been trimmed down too much that more information would have been welcome. William Hurt pops up only for two quick scenes as a friend of Barnes latters son (Max Minghella) has but a toss-away interlude and repeated appearances by Holidays grouchy father are confounding. Performances are all cut from the same serious unostentatious cloth. Clooney in an effective self-effacing turn delivers an agent whose determination still trumps a growing exasperation. Damon embodies a boy-man whose opportunistic moral choice will forever define him while Siddig cuts a compelling figure as a British-educated Arab royal whose breaks with tradition prove far too ""progressive"" for long-standing vested interests. Wrights character is so zipped up and close-to-the-vest that even this most inventive of thesps cant provide a glimmer of Holidays inner life. Lensed to a great extent in Dubai and Morocco as well as in Europe and the States pic gives the impression of great mobility and agitation without Gaghan and cinematographer Robert Elswit indulging in visual showboating; compositions are actually rather plain. Dominant effect of the locations is backed up with seamless production design by Dan Weil.
