Thats clearly an inappropriate emotion to direct at someone who is rich and famous and has been able to write his own ticket in Hollywood for many years but I cant quite help it. Sandlers certainly not the only comedy star who has tried and failed to make the Tom Hanks/Robin Williams transition to A-list leading man -- see also Carrey Jim career of -- but I detect a distinctive mixture of anger and pathos in his case. We didnt go to see ""Punch-Drunk Love"" or ""Spanglish"" or the 153-minute Apatow-Sandler mess-bomb ""Funny People"" in sufficient numbers to rescue Sandler from doing gags about barf and semen on a wedding dress and now hes gonna make us freakin pay.Theres something sick and desperate about ""Thats My Boy"" in which Sandler quite literally plays a rape survivor trying to reconnect with his illegitimate and damaged adult son who has moved away and changed his name. Comedy gold right? (I know ""rape survivor"" is inflammatory language and yes an underage boy having sex with a female teacher -- the scenario here -- is a more ambiguous situation than the other way around. But its still not a 100 percent rockin idea and legally and morally thats the right term.) This film is an especially toxic blend of the condescension idiocy and sentimentality that characterizes almost all of Sandlers recent work under his Happy Madison label. It points you toward the irresistible conclusion that for all his success Sandler feels only contempt for his audience and tremendous insecurity about his own stature in the comedy universe.Let me back up for a sec and make clear that even in ""Thats My Boy"" I was reminded that I find certain things about Sandler commendable. Just not his movies or his persona or his career as a whole. He has an appetite for absurdism and a gift for the almost unnoticed throwaway gag that can definitely be amusing in small doses and you get the general sense that in real life hes probably a mensch. He casts Vanilla Ice in this movie for example playing the washed-up white rapper Vanilla Ice now a fry cook at a Boston fast-food joint. At first youre like OK this is 30 seconds of ""Ice Ice Baby"" and then were moving on. But no The fictional Vanilla Ice in this movie is a fleshed-out character with a back story a place to live (in the projects) and a penchant for bong hits and the real 44-year-old Vanilla Ice turns out to be an agreeable and charming screen presence with a lively sense of humor. He might get some actual work after this; Sandler did the dude a solid no question.As is customary in Sandlers movies -- this ones directed by Sean Anders who seems to have taken over from Sandlers longtime factory foreman Dennis Dugan -- theres a lot of random pop-culture stuff around the edges of the picture thats more fun to read about than to see. Im not an NFL fan so I didnt grasp until a day later that the guy who plays a shady storefront lawyer obsessed with Boston sports heroes in general and the New England Patriots in particular is actually Rex Ryan coach of the New York Jets (the Patriots biggest rivals). ESPN sportscaster Dan Patrick -- last seen in the Sandler oeuvre emceeing a hula contest between Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman in ""Just Go With It"" -- is on hand as a sleazy reality-TV host. James Caan and Susan Sarandon have embarrassing bit parts the former rocking a dreadful Irish accent and the latter making finger motions customarily associated with underage Thai prostitutes. Vanilla Ice isnt even the only 80s celebrity playing himself; his co-worker at the fast-food stand is one-time kid star Todd Bridges of ""Diffrent Strokes"" depicted as a foulmouthed drug abuser. Theres also a slimy tycoon type played by Tony Orlando and if youre in the target audience for this movie you wont have the slightest idea who that is. (I honestly thought Tony Orlando was dead and that this was a washed-up Tony Orlando impersonator. Sorry about that T) You Might Also Like Its not exactly a news flash that Sandler isnt making movies for me or people like me but even by the standards of his lackadaisical vulgar comedies ""Thats My Boy"" plumbs a new low. (Admittedly its probably not worse than the insulting ""Grown Ups"" or the bilious and hateful ""Jack and Jill"" although its dirtier than either. Suddenly ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" both of which are basically terrible look like understated works of Lubitsch-style comic genius.) Sandler graduates here from the PG-13 poop-and-vomit humor that has long been his specialty to racier penis-oriented wit. This feels way too Farrelly brothers circa 1998 and is not a natural fit partly because no one (I feel confident about this) really wants to think that much about Adam Sandler as a sexual being. A lot of the jokes in this movie however resolve to familiar misogynistic themes Fat chicks are fat old chicks are old and ugly chicks are ugly but all of the above are preferable to pretty women who are duplicitous bitches.Im genuinely curious about the strategy behind the construction of Sandlers screen persona at least in his recent comedies Why does he have to play a character who is universally agreed to be the coolest guy in the universe (except by squares and pussies)? Most comic actors from Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton onward have thrived on undercutting themselves making themselves look flawed and silly. Its a way of engendering audience identification of making us like them and root for their eventual triumph. Sandler seems to shoot in that general direction here after playing rich famous successful and thoroughly impervious guys in his last several movies but he cant pull it off. Donny Berger of ""Thats My Boy"" is halfway supposed to be an 80s loser with a rusted-out Pontiac Fiero a shag haircut and Van Halen on the tape deck. But even his mode of being a loser is awesome; he was once famous for being the kid who nailed (and impregnated) a hot teacher at his South Boston middle school and now hes broke and his best friend is an enormous stripper called Champale. But exactly why Donny is broke seems a mystery given that dudes of all social strata are drawn to his clarion call of ""Whazzup"" and large-breasted women in hot tubs seem to find his juvenile sex talk irresistible. Its only his pantywaist son (Andy Samberg) with his obscure resentment at having been born out of a tabloid scandal named Han Solo and then abandoned who fails to appreciate that Donny is the wickedest dad you could ever want. Of course all he needs is a single night out drinking whoring and vandalizing with Pop and Vanilla Ice -- thats all every boy needs after all.Yes youre right; Im taking this all too seriously. Sandlers brand of comedy involves no crimes against humanity and if people want to pay good money to watch him beat off to a picture of a polyester-suited grandma I guess Chief Justice Roberts would say thats why we have the First Amendment. Its just that theres something bitter and weird and unsettling about the place where Sandler seems to be right now. Hes definitely capable of better -- maybe not of great but lets say of pleasant mediocrity -- and his current work feels like a classic cry for help. Im not sure which possibility is worse That his screen persona is completely cynical calculated to appeal to the ultra-fragile egos of teenage boys or that he actually needs this reassurance on a personal level because hes a 45-year-old comedian doing jism jokes and hating himself for it.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A pre-pubescent teen who impregnated his teacher tries as an adult to reconnect with his estranged son. (Rating R for language crude humor) BOTTOM LINE Theres little point in calling Sandler insensitive but this mean-spirited mockery of sexual abuse and other taboos is a new low. CAST Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Leighton Meester LENGTH 154 You might have heard this story before In 1984 schoolteacher Mary McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino) was caught having sex with her barely pubescent student Donny Berger (Justin Weaver) resulting in tabloid headlines a pregnancy jail time for her and high-fiving for him. Thirty years later he is unemployed and functionally alcoholic with no idea what became of his child. Thats the premise of Adam Sandlers latest comedy ""Thats My Boy"" which finds sniggering humor in teen sexual abuse and other depressing topics. And if youre already doubling over with laughter then happy Fathers Day Your weekend must-see flick has arrived. advertisement | advertise on newsday To be sure Sandler has never been our most sensitive comedian but even his crudest comedies tend to have a glimmer of heart. ""Thats My Boy"" directed by newcomer Sean Anders and written by David Caspe (""Happy Endings"") is surprisingly mean-spirited from start to finish. Sadder even than Donny (played as an adult by Sandler with his fallback gimpy accent) is his estranged son Todd (Andy Samberg) a wealthy Wall Streeter still suffering from the neuroses and diabetes he developed as an obese child. Samberg plays the socially maladroit Todd almost too well sniveling pathetically around his demanding fiancee Jamie (Leighton Meester) and her hostile brother Chad (Milo Ventimiglia). When Donny crashes Todds tony wedding ""Thats My Boy"" goes in for shock-the-snobs comedy but the snobs are already repugnant types like Todds leering boss Steve (Tony Orlando) and Jamies sex-crazed granny Delores (Peggy Stewart). By contrast Donnys sad-sack friends are one-hit rapper Vanilla Ice and former child star Todd Bridges whose self-mockery is more depressing that funny. 234 VideoTrailer Thats My Boy The climactic plot twist of ""Thats My Boy"" wont be spoiled here. Lets just say its a bad-taste shocker in a movie that already had more than its share.

The premise Van Halens 1984--specifically ""Hot for Teacher."" In time-tested SNL-alum-movie fashion Thats My Boy has a protagonist-as-kid prologue--Massachusetts teen Donny Berger knocks up his teacher and becomes an 80s-media phenom in the process--and a beat-the-clock fundraising plot as adult Donny (Adam Sandler) now a fortysomething Bud-swilling has-been who refuses to believe the party is over needs a windfall to pay off his back taxes. This prompts Donny to opportunistically search out the estranged son who resulted from his statutory first love. He discovers that little Han Solo Berger is now grown up and living incognito as rising businessman ""Todd Peterson"" (Andy Samberg) trying to forget his trashy upbringing while on the eve of a Cape Cod wedding to a picture-perfect fiancee (Leighton Meester) which would assure him admission to the upper classes--except Donny arrives to rescue his son from the bourgeoisie neurosis. Sandler is in full pandering Gen X nostalgia mode here a la The Wedding Singer; at worst this means an extended cameo for Vanilla Ice but for all that there is far more generosity of spirit and more dumb laffs in Sandlers latest wicked pissah a paean to let-it-all-hang-out party-guy sloppiness than in the sterile Glee-perky Rock of Ages.Film Details Thats My Boy RatingR GenreComedy Running Time114 min.

Yes the last several films Adam Sandler has starred in have ranged from barely tolerable to intolerably awful but its not like he makes movies all by himself. ""Thats My Boy"" was written by David Caspe creator of TVs very funny ""Happy Endings"" -- and someone Sandler has never worked with before. The same goes for the director Sean Anders (whose ""Sex Drive"" wasnt bad). Besides the new collaborators ""Thats My Boy"" had an R rating going for it. Nearly all of Sandlers bad comedies (and his good ones for that matter if your memory stretches back that far) have been PG-13 or PG. Having a wider arsenal of swear words and crass situations to draw from doesnt guarantee more laughs but at least it changes up the formula which is something Sandler definitely needed. The last R-rated film he made ""Funny People"" was the best thing hed done in years. So it was with a certain level of cautious optimism that I approached ""Thats My Boy"" in which Sandler plays the dirtbag father of a young man (Andy Samberg) he spawned when he was 13 the product of a scandalous affair with his teacher. And it was with a significantly greater level of disappointment and heavy-heartedness that I exited the theater two hours later my spirit broken my optimism shattered my soul reborn under a thick cynical shell. ""Thats My Boy"" is yet another putrid comedy in which Sandler plays an aggressive idiot with an annoying fake voice who shows up to disrupt someones life and in which the message of the film turns out to be that everyone needs to act more like the aggressive idiot. (Adam Sandler characters seldom see the need to learn or grow. I assume this is an example of art imitating life.) This time hes doing a thick Boston-y accent as Donny Berger a former tabloid fixture who impregnated his middle school teacher in 1984 and has been riding on the fumes of that notoriety ever since. The teacher is in prison and Donnys offspring (played by Andy Samberg) has changed his name from Han Solo Berger to Todd Peterson in an effort to distance himself from his icky origins and his Donny-influenced upbringing. Now in desperate need of cash to pay off tax debts and avoid prison Donny reaches out to Todd -- now a successful financier -- on the eve of his wedding to the beautiful Jamie (Leighton Meester). Everyone is at Todds boss lavish summer home on Cape Cod the perfect setting for an uncouth loudmouth to appear and offend people. Keenly aware that Todd wants nothing to do with him and that he has in fact told everyone his parents are dead Donny presents himself as Todds best friend (albeit a best friend Todd had never mentioned before). Next thing you know Donnys the best man in the wedding and everyones new favorite guy The joke is that while Todd is normal nice and reasonable nobody likes him much while they go nuts for Donny a beer-drinking cretin who adamantly refuses to adjust his mullet-oriented eff-you behavior for any situation. Everyone in the wedding party from demure old grandma (Peggy Stewart) to Todds square coworker (Will Forte) thinks Donny is a hoot even when doing so contradicts what has already been established about those characters. Maybe ""characters"" is too strong a word. Apart from Todd (who is neurotic and emotionally scarred by Donnys negligent parenting) and Donny (who is a lewd imbecile end of story) no one in the film is a ""character"" really. They exist as springboards for whatever outrageous self-consciously taboo-busting thing Donny is gonna do next. If a scene requires someone to be quarrelsome the person will be quarrelsome even if he or she was docile in the last scene. Ill give an example that represents the rancid screenplays festering laziness. When Jamies brother Chad (Milo Ventimiglia) a U.S. Marine arrives Todd good-naturedly salutes him. Chads response is anger and indignation A civilian should never salute military personnel. Later when Donny arrives and does the same thing Chad happily returns the salute. The comic premise of one character being praised while another is chastised for the same behavior is solid enough but it doesnt work when you apply it arbitrarily. Without an in-story reason for the different reactions its a non sequitur a leap from Point A to Point B with no line between them. The movie does this over and over again expecting us to laugh just because well thats where the laugh should go. The other major thing it does repeatedly is try to get laughs by being tasteless -- not by humorously employing a tasteless scenario mind you but merely by being tasteless. I think there is rich potential in jokes commenting on societys double standards about underage relationships where a 13-year-old girl who has sex with her teacher is a rape victim while a 13-year-old boy who nails his teacher is a hero. There is also something to be said for the premise of a child being more responsible than his father. But ""Thats My Boy"" squanders nearly every opportunity to find real humor in any of this resorting instead to poo-poo pee-pee boners and bongs. Theres casual racism toward the Chinese household staff -- not because it makes any sense for these characters to be casually racist but because its funny to hear people say racist things. To be clear I have no problem with making comedy out of forbidden topics. You do have to actually make the comedy though. Merely presenting an appalling situation -- That stripper is fat That grandma is horny That man has a potty mouth -- is not by itself funny. How do Sandler and his cohorts not realize this? Somehow stretched to an excruciating 116 minutes in length the film offers seven or eight genuinely clever lines but they are drowned out by the braying pointless stupidity that surrounds them. Now if youll excuse me Im going to watch something funnier than ""Thats My Boy."" Its a video of my mother being torn apart by bears. Good day.

"Boy oh boy Another low-brow delivery from Adam Sandler |       NJ.com comments Boy oh boy Another low-brow delivery from Adam Sandler Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 15 2012 at 700 AM View/Post Comments Tracy Bennett Adam Sandler as Donny Berger and Andy Samberg as his son Todd Peterson in ""Thats My Boy."" When Adam Sandler made ""Funny People"" -- one of those surprisingly good comedies he does maybe twice a decade just to mess with us -- the best bitterest joke was the idea of him playing an angry actor who made his fortune off low-brow high-concept comedies. Except the joke was on us. Because since then it seems as if hes gone on to make some of those movies for real. Remember ""Grown Ups""? ""Just Go With It""? Or -- uh-oh -- ""Jack and Jill""? Or maybe now ""Thats My Boy""? The movie starts out in dont-go-there territory and then goes further as it tells the story of a 1980s middle-schooler who is seduced by his teacher. She gets pregnant and goes to jail. He becomes a tabloid celebrity and then an alcoholic. Whoa statutory rape motherless children drunken decadence -- stop guys youre killing me Skip ahead 20 or so years and the product of that union -- who has had nothing to do with his father since he turned 18 -- is about to get married. And guess who turns up before the wedding looking to reconnect and maybe borrow a whole lot of money? As I said low-brow high-concept. The movie feels a bit like early Farrelly Brothers from the New England locations to the obsession with bodily fluids and the jokes about sex with old women. Its all politically incorrect -- deliberately so -- but thats not the problem here. The problem is its not particularly funny. As the father Sandler wears a black wig that looks as if it were combed with a rake and approximates a Boston accent by talking through his nose and sticking ""wicked"" in every other sentence. As his son Andy Samberg has all the screen presence of a soft-boiled egg. There are two things that give the movie a bit of juice. One is the epic bachelor party this misfit father is determined to throw his son. It doesnt approach the bacchanalian excess of the first ""The Hangover"" (or even ""Bridesmaids"") but is ugly and outrageous and sometimes even makes you laugh. The other thing that livens things up is the supporting cast. Its a surprising collection of serious actors in comic roles and pop-culture has-beens in knowing takeoffs and while I dont want to say who does what some of the familiar faces include Tony Orlando and Vanilla Ice. Theres also a nicely insane turn by Milo Ventimiglia as perhaps the least pleasant Marine since Preston Sturges ""Hail the Conquering Hero."" And I promise that is the first and last time I will ever invoke Sturges while reviewing an Adam Sandler movie. Because most of this is just gross without being funny full of the go-to jokes (fat people running old people talking dirty) that only dirty-minded kids would laugh at. You know the kind of kids who sat in school leering at the librarian and thinking about Van Halens ""Hot for Teacher."" And then grew up to make movies like this. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations adult sex with minors strong language drug and alcohol abuse and violence. Thats My Boy (R) Columbia (114 min.) Directed by Sean Anders.

At 45 hes still playing overgrown boy-men but his characters these days arent just emotionally stunted basket cases. Theyre jerks and rubes and loutish vulgarians the more hideously unpresentable the better. Theyre characters who almost dare reviewers to say ""Thats stupid and obnoxious"" (And if you do youve fallen for the bait; youve become like the scolding parents in a 50s anti-rock screed.) Since weve all grown used to seeing Sandler portray these incorrigible idiots in a sense he has to keep upping the ante. Its his equivalent of playing that power chord just a little bit louder. Watching Sandler in Thats My Boy his latest assault on subtlety good taste and other values that a critic like me is supposed to trash the star for dumping on I cant say that I laughed a lot (though when I did laugh it was big and loud). But on some level I marveled at the conviction that Sandler pours into playing a character like Donny Berger a boneheaded loud-mouthed alcoholic loser from Boston. Wearing his hair in a greasy 80s shag dressed in vests and jackets that make him look like a runt Bruce Springsteen Sandler make no mistake doesnt phone it in. He delivers every single line with the unspeakably annoying rasp of a rusty nail scraping on your brainpan. He also gives Donny what you could call a full range of moods angry irritated pushy noodgy grasping wheedling whining. A real charmer. Just to make sure we know what kind of role model Donny is hardly a scene goes by in which he doesnt have a Budweiser in his hand and the vulgarities too spew out of him like beery foam. A lot of actors by now have learned to do a Boston accent but Sandler gets something else the blinkered bellowing high dudgeon of a certain kind of in-your-face proletarian slob whom you can still find hovering in Boston sports bars. He makes Donny the Joe Six-Pack from hell. Long ago Donny enjoyed a moment of tabloid infamy. Back in 1984 when he was just a teenager in gold chains he got seduced by his sexpot high-school teacher and when it came out that they were sleeping together the scandal of it all made national headlines. The teacher sent to prison for statutory rape even had Donnys baby whom Donny named Han Solo and (once he turned 18) raised as a single parent. But he was such a dismal father that the son disowned him. He also renamed himself Todd. As an adult Todd is played by Andy Samberg as a persnickety hedge-fund manager about to be married to a stuck-up American princess (Leighton Meester). And that of course is when Donny comes crashing back into his life. Thats My Boy is one of those comedies about a walking irritant like What About Bob? in which the joke -- ultimately spun off from Green Acres -- is that the ordinary guy at the center of everything keeps trying to distance himself from the pest who has arrived to ruin his life but everyone around him...adores the pest The more Donny disgraces himself the more he lowers himself (how low does Sandler go? Just wait for the scene in which Donny pleasures himself to the photograph of an old lady) the more he makes the kind of cringe-worthy sexual jokes that Andrew Dice Clay would have turned up his nose at the more that everyone in Todds circle thinks hes the life of the party. I only wish it were a fresher party Donny wins everyone over for instance by reviving ""Wassup"" Seriously? Thats what Sandler now regards as a mischievous joke? Still for a while the lightweight open-faced Andy Samberg makes a good squirmer. His Todd is so neurotically nice that he doesnt even experience his own exasperation even as we can see the steam coming out of his ears. Where Sandler compromises his whole comedy-as-rock-amp;-roll thing is that hes so into making Donny a big teddy bear inside a guy who just wants to bond with his son that the movie starts to lose its edge. It also stretches out far too long. (Did it really need to clock in at nearly two hours?) Donny takes Todd and his friends out for a bachelor party and its on this voyage into the night that Todd loses his inhibitions and starts to get won over to the ways of excess -- to the Donny Way. Lots of jokes about strippers and happy endings follow and Todd gets so unhinged that he barfs all over his fiancees wedding dress. But the movie was a lot funnier when Donny and Todd were foils. Of course never underestimate the importance of guy-on-guy sentimentality to the Adam Sandler universe. Its his way of making his fans feel as if hes high-fiving them or maybe giving them a group hug. But Sandler bottom line is too good at playing louts like Donny to work this hard getting us to like them.

Starring Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Running time 154 Release Opened Jun 15 2012  Editorial Review Thats My Boy Adam Sandler doesnt know bestBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 15 2012Its tempting to call Adam Sandler a rebel. The comedian consistently flouts taste and decency in his movies which can sometimes be a good thing. The only problem with this notion is that rebels at some point usually break a sweat. Sandlers latest vehicle ""Thats My Boy"" is radical only in its extreme laziness. The actor plays Donny a man trying to reconcile with his estranged son Todd (Andy Samberg) whom he fathered with his middle-school teacher as a 13-year-old stud. Sandler attempts to mine this disturbing event for comedy but he also goes after some pretty low-hanging fruit fat people the elderly immigrants washed-up celebrities horndogs and others. Its technique (to use the word in the loosest possible sense) is a blunt instrument. Much of the comedy derives from sex nudity bodily fluids and four-letter words -- a focus so single-minded that the script sometimes seems to have been written by a 13-year-old. It wasnt though writer David Caspe gives no indication of the level of sparkling wit he is capable of (the crass sitcom ""Happy Endings"" which he created). Donnys halting seemingly improvised on-screen speech about love -- in which he describes the emotion in such a way that it sounds like the symptoms of a venereal disease -- is one of many low points in the dialogue. As far as the direction is concerned Sean Anders (""Sex Drive"") seems perfectly adept at turning the camera and lights on and off but little else. The film is long choppy and deadly dull despite sporadic efforts to defibrillate the audience back to consciousness with jokes about incest pedophilia incontinence and geriatric sex. For his part Sandler seems out to top his performance in last years ""Jack and Jill"" which garnered the comic not one but two Razzie Awards (for worst actor and worst actress). Sporting a mullet wig that looks left over from ""The Wedding Singer"" and recycling his trademark accent -- an annoying hybrid of brain-damaged redneck and dirty old man -- he packs enough painful screen presence for three people. Samberg whose role is essentially as straight man is inoffensive but forgettable as a bridegroom who is mortified when his boorish old man shows up on the eve of his wedding to a wealthy heiress (Leighton Meester). Theres no evidence of the comic chops he has displayed on ""Saturday Night Live."" Todd is little more than a victim of Donnys humiliating behavior. Once again Sandler shows himself to be a loyal friend casting such pals as Nick Swardson and Peter Dante in tiny parts that drain all evidence of talent from the performers. ""Thats My Boy"" also features such has-beens as rapper Vanilla Ice singer Tony Orlando veejay Colin Quinn and actors Ian Ziering Alan Thicke and Todd Bridges along with fellow ""SNL"" veterans Will Forte and Rachel Dratch miscellaneous Sandler family relatives vaguely familiar-looking former jocks and other assorted hangers-on from the comedians stand-up days. Sandlers Happy Madison production company is like a one-man employment agency for people who have no other reason to be on camera. Of that bunch Vanilla Ice playing a good-natured caricature of himself turns in the funniest performance although its far from professional. So is the movie itself funny? Some people -- including me -- managed to appreciate a dumb joke or two. Sandler has his partisans but the aggressive awfulness of ""Thats My Boy"" seems calculated to test even their patience. As one disgruntled-sounding viewer muttered on the way out ""Sure I laughed but I didnt feel good about myself afterwards."" Contains pervasive vulgarity sexual humor nudity drug use and some comic violence.

Donny Berger (Adam Sandler) and Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg) in Columbia Pictures comedy THATS MY BOY. Photo Tracy Bennett Sony Pictures Thats My Boy review Laughs come too late 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Thats My Boy Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Andy Samberg and Leighton Meester. Directed by Sean Anders. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For about two-thirds of its running time ""Thats My Boy"" has its head stuck in the toilet. Its monumentally coarse and vulgar aimed at the mentality of a 14-year-old locked inside his fathers liquor cabinet and nothing about it is funny least of all Adam Sandler. And then in its last third something happens and ""Thats My Boy"" though just as stupid and vulgar as ever becomes funny at least here and there. Sandler still isnt getting his laughs but the movie becomes watchable and with a few cringes reasonably enjoyable. Call this the film equivalent of the Stockholm syndrome or just the story kicking into gear but in any case the question before the moviegoing public this weekend is this Is it worth 80 minutes of irritation to arrive at 35 minutes of mildly satisfying entertainment? There are three answers to that question and lets say them out loud just for fun Uh no. No. And no. Central to the movies deficiencies is Sandlers inability to create a comic character. At his best in movies like ""Funny People"" ""Click"" and ""Just Go With It"" he plays a version of himself and reacts as a straight man to the antics of the people around him. But Sandler is at a loss when he has to be zany. Whether its as Jill in the disastrous ""Jack and Jill"" or here when called upon to be the funny one he carts out the same mannerisms the same speech impediment (a peculiar lisp) and the same air of relentless oblivion. And heres the odd part He never completely commits to a character. Rather watching Sandler in ""Thats My Boy"" is like watching Sandler the straight man commenting on his own comic performance. Instead of playing the character its as if hes mocking himself for attempting it or taunting viewers with the knowledge that theyre dumb enough to be watching him. He phones it in and then waves the phone in your face. Here he plays a dissolute insolvent slob with a scandalous history Apparently when he was a minor he got one of his teachers pregnant. She went to the big house and he enjoyed 15 minutes of celebrity. Twenty-eight years later hes broke and faces a prison term for tax evasion if he cant come up with a large sum of money. By coincidence he finds out just as his long-lost son Todd (Andy Samberg) - the product of his union with the teacher - is about to get married. Whats more Todd is a wealthy venture capitalist. And so ""Thats My Boy"" becomes that inevitable thing the story of how a slob (Sandler) shows up in an environment of rich people - everyone Todd wants to impress such as his boss and his in-laws - and upends everything. But because this is a Sandler movie the intrusion of an idiot into any proceeding must always be a welcome one - no mere encounter with a nuisance but rather an opportunity for staid inhibited people to find joy and wisdom through his soul-healing life force. Perhaps thats the real secret why Sandler can never be funny or truly abandoned in these comic roles He will never surrender his vanity. Samberg as the put-upon son who sees his father as a menace and an intrusion becomes the sympathetic focus throughout less for anything he does than for the fact that he sees his father just as we do. His suffering and discomfort mirror the audiences own impatience and dissatisfaction. Things improve when the story broadens beyond a fathers antics and a sons embarrassment. There are a couple of notable and well-placed cameos - somebody had a budget and was willing to spend it. And Vanilla Ice the white rapper from the early 1990s has a significant role here as himself and believe it or not he is the best thing in the movie. Even Sandler gets better near the finish though knowing the finish is near also helps. None of this makes ""Thats My Boy"" worth seeing but if you do go and feel tempted to leave after the first hour stick it out. If you suffer through the bad part at least wait for the almost good part.     Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Credit Tracy Bennett/Columbia Pictures Rejoice fifth-grade fellas ""Thats My Boy"" is a movie just for you. It has beer hot-for-teacher sex beer gross-out sex beer strip clubs beer lots of bodily fluids and mostly a family of blue bloods gaga over an uncouth man-child.The tale (by David Caspe) is such A 1980s Massachusetts junior high school student fathers a child with his teacher. The act (abuse on her part but dont pause to think) lands her in jail and makes him a celebrity. Jump forward 20-odd years When the Peter-Wicked-Pan father (Adam Sandler) needs money he learns that his dweeby son (Andy Samberg) has become a human computer rich and about to be married. Clearly theres a wedding to crash and adolescent fantasies to fulfill.""Thats My Boy"" is a pretty wretched movie if you want to activate your brain cells but its busily plotted second half approaches involving. It leads to a big payoff wedding after all and it has a large ensemble for support including Leighton Meester Will Forte Vanilla Ice (as himself) a funny James Caan a cameo by Susan Sarandon and plenty of game-for-the-shame adult players like Peggy Stewart as a politely naughty grandmother. Theres even one exceptionally good performance by a committed Milo Ventimiglia as a surprising Marine.Mr. Samberg rarely rises above wooden so hes no match for Mr. Sandlers brazen choices which pass 11 on the dial of irritation. Still Mr. Sandler manages a frame or so of genuine sentiment and the caricature is so ugly its cute. Hes a performer and there are moments when audiences will surrender to his shtick. Moments.""Thats My Boy"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex drugs language and crudity that even many fifth graders will find tired.

Its Sambergs first major movie role.EnlargeCloseBy Tracy Bennett Sony PicturesAdam Sandler left and Andy Samberg star in Thats My Boy. Its Sambergs first major movie role.Sponsored LinksBut hes back with Thats My Boy ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) another bottom-of-the-barrel raunchfest that is bound to make far more money than such sludge could ever deserve.Sandler is capable of good performances. He proved it unequivocally with 2009s Funny People and in 2002s Punch-Drunk Love. Not every film has to be nuanced or important. But comedies do need to make people laugh.MORE View the latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesFor some reason Sandler is hellbent on perpetuating and repurposing his annoying brand of moronic preadolescent schtick. Worse his lowbrow comedies seem to be sinking ever lower.Thats My Boy is puerile mean-spirited and charmless. The laughs are almost always at someones expense or involve incredibly vulgar jokes about bodily functions.Sandler plays the boorish Donny Berger whose development was arrested at 13 when he began a sexual affair with his teacher (Eva Amurri Martino). Now at about age 40 he still dresses as he did as a kid sports a mullet as he did in middle school and engages in the same behavior. With the notoriety that came from his teachers trial (which resulted in her 30-year imprisonment) Donny also became a low-level celebrity.About the movieThats My Boy out of fourStars Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Leighteon Meester Tony Orlando Vanilla Ice James Caan Milo Ventimiglia Director Sean AndersDistributor Columbia Pictures Rating R for crude sexual content throughout nudity pervasive language and some drug use Running time 1 hour 56 minutes Opens Friday nationwideA son was born of the union and when he turned 18 Donny got custody of his boy whom he named Han Solo. Now in his 20s Solo has renamed himself Todd (Andy Samberg) and distanced himself from the dad who had no idea how to raise him. Donny made his 8-year-old son drive him around when he was drunk and let him eat all the cake he wanted resulting in his weighing 400 pounds.But Todd has slimmed down and become a hedge fund manager and is poised to marry the glamorous Jamie (Leighton Meester). Then Donny barges back into his life just days before the wedding swilling beer and talking trash. He needs 43000 for the back taxes he never paid and is being offered cash by a reality TV show -- if he can arrange a meeting between his son and his jailed mom (later played by Martinos real-life mom Susan Sarandon). Todd knows nothing of this and slowly begins to warm up to his raucous rascal of a dad.Contortionist strippers a bridal gown soiled by vomit and semen a randy granny a violent priest poop jokes and an extended incest gag figure into this unfunny gross-out fest.Sandler plays a man-child in the most off-putting way. To say that his movies are an acquired taste is to deceptively imply that there is an element of taste involved.Samberg who can be quite funny on Saturday Night Live picked a lousy vehicle for his first major big-screen role. Playing straight man to the endlessly irritating Sandler is a thankless job.Thats My Boy is beyond bad. Its two hours of non-stop wince-inducing misfires punctuated by Sandlers distinctively grating voice. Its a nearly intolerable experience.

The premise of ""Thats My Boy"" is ludicrous which is fine.As a Somerville (wicked) middle school kid in the 1980s young Donny scored with his teacher and got her pregnant. She went to prison (a page right out of the 1980s Pamela Smart case) and he raised their son solo. Actually make that Han Solo since thats what this ""Hot for Teacher"" kid decided to name his boy. Then Donny rode his own wave of celebrity. For a while.Now all grown up and down-and-out adult Donny (Adam Sandler) is living on a prayer. He drives a beat-up car emblazoned with a Rush emblem and cranks the tunes from his cassette deck. Meanwhile the adult Han Solo (Andy Samberg) is a financial whiz kid renamed Todd who is so emotionally scarred that hes never without a second pair of underpants. Todd has disowned his dad and is about to be married to Jamie (Leighton Meester of ""Country Strong"") which will usher him into the picture-perfect world of investment banking and summers on the Cape.The clanking plot device bringing these two worlds together is a debt Donny owes to the IRS payable if he can arrange a mother-son-father jailhouse reunion for a local reality TV show. Enter wedding-crasher Sandler arriving at Todd and Jamies nuptials spouting a wicked Boston accent and a Ric Ocasek rocker hair mop. Whassup?Weve seen this sweet doofus before in everything from ""Billy Madison"" to ""Happy Gilmore."" This time Sandler wages class war with his wild-mouthed antics getting stuffy rich folk to lighten up. Hes the underachieving underdog with a heart of gold winning over doubters by arranging a last-minute strip club bachelor party. Beer can constantly in hand Sandler selfishly devours every scene with a squirm-worthy Bah-ston caricature (though locals might cheer seeing ""Somerville Middle School"" in the opening flashback).Oddly Samberg is cast as the nerdy-OCD straight guy a role that requires little of his comedic talents. Samberg recently announced his departure from the career launch pad ""Saturday Night Live."" We know hes a much smarter actor than the material hes given to work with in this movie.How did American comedies come to rely on raunch rather than wordplay? Director Sean Anders (""Sex Drive"") and writer David Caspe (TVs ""Happy Endings"") try to out-gross-out the Farrelly brothers and their poop-by-numbers comedy nearly succeeds. Some of the father-son dialogue hits the mark; in a scene rehashing Donnys past parenthood missteps a pet snake once fed Quaaludes was the ""only time anyone saw a king cobra laugh."" But these few sparks are lost among scenes of old ladies as foul-mouthed sexpots fat jokes and masturbation and barf gags.At least theres some joy in spotting cameos by rapper Vanilla Ice Todd Bridges (""Diffrent Strokes"") Tony Orlando (yes him) and Susan Sarandon. James Caan plays get this a fighting Irish priest. Theres even New York Jets coach Rex Ryan as Donnys New England Patriots-loving pal.Sadly ""Thats My Boy"" relies on caricatures rather than characters to make you laugh.Ethan Gilsdorf can be reached at ethanethangilsdorf.com.

If their genders were reversed Thats My Boy would be cause for a congressional hearing. But in a film defined by juvenile fantasy the kid becomes not only the class hero but an 80s cultural icon on par with Vanilla Ice and Diffrent Strokes Todd Bridges (both of whom appear as themselves.) Right off the bat Thats My Boy introduces what passes for a central theme Dont be so sensitive dude. What the stuffed shirts might call irredeemably tasteless this movie calls politically incorrect which is why the judge who hits the teacher with a 30-year statutory-rape sentence is depicted as a prudish harridan. And the irreverence doesnt stop there How about a 10-minute autoerotic session inspired by a sexy octogenarian? Or an obese stripper scarfing down eggs and orange juice mid-routine while hanging backwards from a pole? In Sandler boorish louts have finally found their champion. After the prologue Thats My Boy cuts to the present day as Donny (Sandler) having long exhausted his 15 minutes of fame faces jail time if he fails to pay years in back taxes. Though he raised his son Todd (Andy Samberg) as a single dad the two havent seen each other since Todds 18th birthday when the boy left his irresponsible father changed his identity and eventually found success as a Wall Street hedge-fund manager. When Donny sees notice of Todds upcoming wedding to uptight golddigger Jamie (Leighton Meester) he takes the opportunity to reconcile with his son and coax a little money out of him. Donny and Todd are a study in extremes. Donny is a fouler version of the standard Sandler man-child callous and puerile on the outside but soft as a turtles belly-meat underneath. By contrast Sambergs Todd is uptight and ineffectual bowing to his fiancees constant browbeating and reacting to adversity by stroking a fresh pair of underwear like a security blanket. i Vanilla Ice (center) appears as himself in Thats My Boy a film whose protagonist (Sandler) was himself famous -- or at least notorious -- for about 15 minutes. Tony Rivetti/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Tony Rivetti/Columbia Pictures Vanilla Ice (center) appears as himself in Thats My Boy a film whose protagonist (Sandler) was himself famous -- or at least notorious -- for about 15 minutes. Tony Rivetti/Columbia Pictures Todd has reason to be bitter about his upbringing -- a diet consisting entirely of sugary treats has left him diabetic and he was never taught simple things like how to swim or ride a bike -- and for that Donny can only apologize. Yet the push and pull between Donny and Todd doesnt bring them somewhere toward the middle as might be expected. From the films warped perspective Todd just needs to loosen up and be more like his beer-swilling dad which means no more spa treatments no soirees that dont detour through a strip club no avoiding conflicts that can be resolved with a good ole sock in the jaw. Thats My Boy isnt a comedy about a regressive 80s burnout who never grew up but a paean to the virtues of remaining the same vulgar bullying nincompoop at 40 that you were at 14. Not exactly the stuff of public-service announcements. Normally forced to sanitize his blue-collar antics for a PG-13 Sandler and his collaborators play their R-rating to the hilt mostly by adding stomach-turning gross-out jokes to the wedding-themed raunchiness of hits like The Hangover. But much like Donny the Sandler of today hasnt changed much from the Sandler who introduced himself in Billy Madison nearly 20 years ago. He doesnt just appeal to the lowest common denominator -- hes its jock-scratching embodiment.

His core fans are likely to love him as a rude crude and socially unacceptable dad to son Andy Samberg By Mary Pols MaryPolsJune 14 2012 Share Read Later Sony PicturesTodd Peterson (Andy Samberg) and Donny Berger (Adam Sandler) in Thats My Boy. Thats My Boy Year 2012 Director Sean Anders Studio Columbia Pictures Actors Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Leighton Meester Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Leave it to Adam Sandler to explore the comic potential of a 13 year-old being deflowered by a middle school teacher. In Thats My Boy which is a thousand times better and funnier than Jack and Jill Sandlers last movie yet still falls short of actually being good Sandler plays Donny Berger a lout from the Boston suburb of Somerville. Donny spent 1984 being hot for teacher (Eva Amurri Martino) and the rest of his life being infamous for having sex with said teacher and irresponsible about the consequence a baby boy named Han Solo Berger. With Mom in prison teenaged Dad Donny stuffed the child with cake and ice cream let him drive at 8 (designated driver) and had his back tattooed with all of the New Kids on the Block. Since living with Donny was like being trapped in a Hangover movie that never ended Han Solo took off as soon as he turned 18. He was obese and diabetic when he left Donnys nest but managed to reinvent himself as Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg) a fit wealthy hedge fund manager and all around sweetie pie with just a wee dependence on Zanax. (MORE Where Adam Sandler falls on Times list of Top 10 Unconventional Leading Men) Todd wants nothing to do with Donny which seems like a fantastic idea wed support but Donny facing a 43000 tax bill from the IRS comes up with a nefarious and sleazy plan to raise the money that requires Todds participation. On the eve of Todds tasteful seaside wedding to high maintenance Jamie (Leighton Meester) Donny shows up with his mullet and acid-washed denim wardrobe toting an overnight bag. ""Whats that Louis Vuitton?"" Todd says voice dripping with sarcasm. Donny looks puzzled. ""Its a Hefty bag"" he says then proceeds to unpack his necessities condoms weapons beer. Its a culture (and class) clash but Donny cant and wont be cowed. Hes a man of the people and proud of it. Many lies and deceptions follow including one that Donny is Todds best friend. At one point a character has drunken relations with a wedding dress (which sounds hard but if the flesh is willing...). Theres a great deal of nostalgia involved not just for the 80s but for the years immediately before and after that decade. Todd Bridges from Diffrent Strokes works at an ice rink. Nineties rapper Vanilla Ice playing himself has sex with Tony Orlandos grandmother. Or rather the 70s pop stars characters grandmother who is played by an 89-year-old actress (Peggy Stewart). Thats My Boy offers a very thorough sampling of twisted sex without judgment. The soup to nuts of sex acts are supported and even applauded except for incest. That remains taboo which means there is a shred of hope for civilization. (MORE What an awesome year Adam Sandler had at the Razzies) I did laugh. The movie is so disgusting it is worthy of  the Farrelly brothers. It contains the longest simultaneous joke about child rape and its effects on the victim (drug abuse alcoholism etc.) ever made. Call me a prude but you know little Donny was raped. I had to turn away from the screen at times--apologies to the sisterhood of acceptance of all body types but the more I saw of Donnys best stripper friend (the zaftig Luenell who played the hooker in Borat) topless or pole dancing the queasier I felt. But again I did laugh. Its not so much the jokes as written but the go-for-broke performances. Vanilla Ice is funny. Milo Ventimiglia who was not exactly a barrel of laughs in Heroes is hilarious as Jamies super serious soldier brother Chad. Sandler has his moments particularly while wielding a beer bottle. Theres a perfectly timed cameo involving an Oscar winning actress. Playing a pugilist priest James Caan is supposed to be funny but instead is terrifying. He and Sandler who weaves in and out of that weird half-old-man-half-baby talk voice he likes so much could have a championship slur-off. But the truth is even without pleasant surprises like Vanilla Ice and Ventimiglia Im not sure I could ever truly hate a movie that features so much of the adorable Andy Samberg who acts his little heart out as if this were Shakespeare in the Park. Having the past and present Saturday Night Live cast members play father and son was a stroke of genius. I dont know if director Sean Anders (who co-wrote the deliriously stupid Hot Tub Time Machine) was directly responsible but he certainly was lucky. Samberg plays Todd as a sort of manchild as fresh as a daisy as affable as a puppy. Compared to Sandlers Donny who needs to be bathed then fumigated hes practically dewy. His chin dimple has never seemed so akin to a babys bottom. He is also so fiercely dedicated to communicating the agony of what it was like to be raised by an idiot only 13 years older than him that for a few minutes here and there I almost took Thats My Boy seriously. (MORE A rave for serious Sandler in Punch Drunk Love) Speaking of is Sandlers foray into serious movies over? The best of them Punch Drunk Love won critical acclaim but didnt appeal to his base. Spanglish and the most recent 2009s Funny People were mediocre and underwhelmed at the box office. I believe I was one of 10 people nationwide who didnt hate 2006s Reign Over Me. Thats a lot of rejection for an actor so no wonder everything since Funny People has been a return to form. Certainly the clear signal Sandler sends with Thats My Boy is heres your boy--rude crude and socially unacceptable just the way you like him.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Lowbrow comedy goes subterranean in ""Thats My Boy"" a product of the Adam Sandler movie factory unpolluted by a trace of ambition or wit. This film forgets that good comedy is rarely dumb it just plays dumb. Sandler treading water in a sea of bodily fluids retarded sexuality and antisocial behavior makes you yearn for the rib-tickling sophistication of ""Ernest Goes to Camp."" The movie should be buried in a time capsule to teach future generations what to avoid. The deluxe-stupid script positions Sandler as Donny a washed-up minor celebrity who rocketed to national fame when he impregnated his red-hot math teacher at age 13. Now hes a beer-bloated middle-aged child-man who needs his successful adult sons financial help to avoid a prison sentence for tax evasion. The boy (Andy Samberg) whom he christened Han Solo changed his name to Todd and severed all ties for reasons that should be obvious. On Todds wedding weekend Donny re-enters his life wreaking havoc at every turn. As he has done before Sandler makes his character a babe magnet with mythological stamina and the benevolence to confer his sexual favors on elderly women too. Sad sack Samberg is Donnys mirror image. Hes the poster boy for mousy repression -- his pretty domineering fiancee is obviously interested in the rising executive for his money alone -- and when he grasps the situation Dad changes his mission deciding that a good gutter-wallowing hookers-and-booze bachelor party is what his dweebish boy needs. Cue the urine and barf jokes. If this summary is unpleasant I assure you the film is a lot more fun to read about than to endure. It is about as funny as watching an obese stripper eating an omelet while upside down on her dance pole. Which they actually show. The standard Sandlerisms repeat themselves. The notion that older women might have sexual urges is treated with comic mockery. Roly-poly guys jiggle across the screen in revealing attire. Surprise Star Cameos drag a veritable Whos Who of familiar faces out of retirement and repurpose them as objects of our derision. Why else cast Tony Orlando in a supporting role that requires him to wear the worlds ugliest toupee? At least I hope its a toupee. When the sex gags flout one taboo act that will never have its own Pride Day Parade the spiral of misery and torment reaches whirlpool velocity. Tracy Bennett Star Tribune Andy Samberg and Adam Sandler in ""Thats My Boy."" The mix of hackery and self-regard on display here is amazing. The film is the work of professionals who have the resources to make a well-constructed comedy. They simply dont respect their audiences or their craft enough to make the effort.

Matt Sayles Andy Samberg Leighton Meester and Adam Sandler stars of the new film Thats My Boy appear onstage at the MTV Movie Awards on June 3. Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP Surely its more fun to make an Adam Sandler movie than to watch one.Imagine youre guzzling brews in the jacuzzi with Adam and his pals spitballing ideas for his next script. When Rob Schneider suggests a movie in which Sandler plays a merman the Boss says he already used that idea in ""Funny People."" Then he orders the little freeloader to get the shoeshine box.Schneider frowns like a beaten mule and struggles to pull himself out of the tub. ""Just messin with ya pal"" says Sandler and everybody laughs on cue.Forced laughter is the only kind youll hear during ""Thats My Boy"" between the long stretches of slack-jawed silence. Even granting that Sandlers income depends on never portraying a grown-up its hard to imagine the flatulence that propelled this listless idea to the top of his hot-tub time machine.Sandler is dumber and raunchier than ever as Donny Berger who impregnated his sexy eighth grade teacher and has been a tabloid-TV punchline for almost 30 years. While the teacher went to prison for statutory rape and Donny squandered the money from selling his life story to Hollywood the grown son (Andy Samberg) changed his name from Han Solo Berger to Todd Peterson severed ties with his neer-do-well father and became a hedge-fund manager.When Donny faces a deadline to pay off a tax debt a producer offers him 50000 for a reunion show with the estranged son so the drunken dad barges into the seaside estate where Todd is due to get married and introduces himself as a long-lost friend. With Todd afraid to reveal his scandalous past to fastidious fiancee Jamie (Leighton Meester) he goes along with Donnys ruse. The wedding weekend becomes a marathon of boorish behavior including the inevitable bodily fluid humor involving fat and/or old people culminating in a ""Hangover""-style bachelor party with Vanilla Ice riding shotgun. In matters of personal taste there is no right or wrong so if erasing brain cells is your idea of a good time ""Thats My Boy"" could be your cup of turpentine.Just messin with ya pal.""Thats My Boy""One and a half stars (Out of four)  Rating R  Run time 202  Content Crude sexual content nudity and strong language Tags Joe Williams Adam Sandler Movie Reviews View (...) comments Most popular Old Standard Fried Chicken will close this weekend Smash-and-grab burglars hit original Sweetie Pies location in Dellwood Mellow Mushroom pizzeria opens in Sunset Hills Today in Pokemon Go Shootout in Vegas security risk in Israel finding Yuri in Russia A little worse for wear Brian Wilson offers good vibrations great music Latest Disney movies help autistic boy find his voice in Life Animated Woody Allens Cafe Society is a bittersweet treat A trio of misfit mothers lose control in Bad Moms Jason Bourne is back doing what he does best Eat That Question taps into Frank Zappa Quick links Comics/games Movie times Pop off forum Reel Time movie forum TV listings The Blender Tube Talk Sign up For Go Sneak Peek Pick up this Sundays paper for the Craft Beer Special Section Get your tickets for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Arts + Craft Brewfest See ads from todays newspaper Manage your services Feast Magazine Ladue News St. Louis Best Bridal STL High School Sports Products and features Apps Archives Calendar Chats Comics amp; games Contests E-edition Forums Newsletters Our events Press releases Tools and services Advertise with us Autos Classifieds Contact us Homes Jobs Newspapers in Education Page reprints Post-Dispatch store Site help Subscriber services (c) Copyright 2016 STLtoday.com 900 N.

Comments click to enlarge Thats My Boy Rated R  116 minutes  2012 Despite their assorted vulgarities and lack of polish the films of Adam Sandler are remarkably consistent in their own particular way. This ones no different Sandler plays a booze-swilling loudmouth who became a media sensation after he knocked up his science teacher in the eighth grade but is now facing prison time for tax evasion. Seeking a cash grab he reaches out to his estranged son (Andy Samberg a veritable Sandler-in-training) a yuppie hedge fund manager on the verge of making millions. The film bears all the marks of a Sandler farce including satirical jabs at upper-middle-class snobbery and a narrative framework contingent on the actions of his character. Lewd and crude as he is Sandlers primary function as a comedian is to stand in opposition to a cultural standard a style that takes obvious cues from Jerry Lewis--but with you know more dick jokes.

Combined. One of those laughs involves a bacchanalian bachelor party featuring Vanilla Ice (as himself) and the other comes from an eleventh-hour cameo by an Oscar-winning actress (whose third-act reveal wont be too much of a surprise to anyone paying attention to the rest of the films casting). Too bad that like most Adam Sandler movies that dont involve Judd Apatow Paul Thomas Anderson or James L. Brooks ""Thats My Boy"" is far longer than it needs to be (114 minutes if youre keeping score at home.) And like the aforementioned subset of Sandler films its vulgar trite sexist misogynist hacky tacky gross sentimental and stupid with occasional flourishes of racism and veiled homophobia thrown in to boot. In other words whether you love Adam Sandler or you hate him hes done it again Sandler stars as Donny Berger who gained notoriety as a 13-year-old in 1984 when he impregnated his sexy math teacher Miss McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino). Young Donny got rich selling his life story for a TV movie and got custody of their child Han Solo Berger. Cut to the present Donnys broke and facing jail time for back taxes owed and the only way he can get back on TV (with a fat paycheck) is to stage a jailhouse reunion with his former lover and their kid on a sleazy daytime talk show. But the now-grown son who now goes by the name Todd (Andy Samberg whos way too good for this) and who claims his parents were killed in an explosion has moved on and plans to marry his girlfriend Jamie (Leighton Meester) that very weekend. Cue the arrival of the beer-swilling Donny with no manners whatsoever and a Massachusetts accent thick as chowdah at the fancy wedding being held at the seaside home of Todds boss Steve (Tony Orlando -- yes that Tony Orlando). Drunken partying embarrassing revelations and the usual sappy Sandlerian family-is-important homilies ensue. A mere plot synopsis however doesnt capture the films wall-to-wall horror at and amusement with female sexuality. From a seemingly endless supply of women characters inappropriately seducing younger men to sight gags involving overweight or partially-paralyzed strippers ""Thats My Boy"" operates on a horny 12-year-olds mentality from start to finish. The nadir comes with a final-act twist that wont be given away here that ranks among the most desperate and tasteless comedic plot twists in Hollywood history. In a smarter movie this gambit might have come off as bold or audacious but here its just nauseating. So yes two laughs sprinkled over a giant bowl of revulsion. But if this is your sort of thing eat up. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

A doofus reconnects with his son. Director David Anders. (153) R Nudity comic violence language drug use. Area theaters. Adam Sandlers latest dreadful but snicker-inducing vehicle ""Thats My Boy"" is less notable for where it falls in the Sandler canon (below ""Happy Gilmore"" ""Big Daddy"" and ""The Wedding Singer"" above ""Click"" and ""Jack and Jill"") than for its Red Bull-and-Bud-fueled ride through Sandlers id. And that as we know is an infantile place filled with lowbrow taste high-voiced silliness and a lot of mid-80s pop culture. In a convoluted backstory 13-old-old Donny Berger is a high school horndog in 1984 South Boston seduced by sexy teacher Mrs. McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino). They get caught she gets pregnant and then sentenced to prison; Donny becomes a tabloid hero then a dad. In a montage we see Donny cash in on his trashy fame; now at 42 hes a loser owing the IRS nearly 50 grand. To get money fast Donny agrees to let a Jerry Springer-like reality-TV host follow him and his now-grown son as they visit Donnys ex-lover in prison. But the kids (Andy Samberg) disowned Donny and changed his name from ""Han Solo"" to Todd. Hes become an uptight hedge-fund manager and is about to be married an event which gets messed up when Donny arrives unexpectedly. Soon the slurring uncouth Donny wraps Todds fiancees family around his finger and loosens Todd up. But when a visit to the incarcerated fiftyish Mrs. McGarricle (Susan Sarandon Martinos real-life mom) is caught on camera Todd thinks Donny is the same louse who never grew up. As awful as most of ""Thats My Boy"" is its sort of mesmerizing to see how Sandler -- in a script credited to David Caspe -- keeps his touchstones in place Theres deep-cut rock on the soundtrack (Rush Meat Loaf) where-are-they-now? cameos (Vanilla Ice Tony Orlando Todd Bridges) male bonding via public urination old guys fighting (here its James Caan as a brawling priest) an irritating revival of some commercial tic (the ""Whasss uuup ?"" greeting is dredged up since Budweiser is prominent in many scenes) plus enough strippers oddball Sandler pals obese guys running middle-aged nudity and dirty-talking old ladies to fill a years worth of cartoons in both Playboy and Mad magazine. It truly does take a village of idiots to get these films made. But thats not demeaning Sandler or his debauched update on Jerry Lewis man-child persona. This kind of good-natured terribleness laced with occasional inspiration takes a precise knowledge of what his guys want. Sandlers done subdued (""Punch-Drunk Love"" ""Reign Over Me"" ""Funny People"") but hes not a subtle dude; he knows which side of the bread his 100-million box office is buttered on. Toward that end choosing Samberg to be Sandler Jr. is inspired. From their anagram-like names to their ""SNL"" roots to their noses thumbed enthusiastically at the establishment theyre peas in a pod. If Samberg bases his career on Sandlers his stock can only rise. As long as he doesnt imitate that irritating high voice. Magic Moment A chase with Sandler and Vanilla Ice sharing a Walkman so they can enjoy ""Ice Ice Baby"" as they run.

Thats My Boy Bomb to bad Director Sean Anders. Cast Adam Sandler Andy Samberg Leighton Meester. Rating R for crude sexual content throughout pervasive language and some drug use. Budweisers mostly but also Rolling Rocks whatever. One assumes its product placement but if thats the case they should have carried it further and given beers to the audience. It would have made the movie a lot easier to sit through. Among the subjects played for ""laughs"" statutory rape incest masturbation involving a picture of an old lady sex with the same old lady vomiting defecation Vanilla Ice. I know when Sandlers not trying hes an easy target and hes not trying here. But honestly this is one of those movies you feel stupider just for having sat through. I think Im already worse at math. Tony Orlando talks My Boy The film begins in the 1980s with young Donny (Justin Weaver) hitting on his teacher Miss McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino). To his surprise and delight it works; an affair ensues but soon theyre discovered she is arrested sent away for 30 years -- and has his baby. Donny becomes a media sensation with everyone clamoring for his attention. Cut to the present. Donny (now played by Sandler) is a mess still milking his 80s glory such as it is for everything he can -- which isnt much. Ms. McGarricle is still in prison and his son who he named Han Solo bolted as soon as he turned 18. Plus Donny needs more than 40000 in back taxes or hes going to go to prison himself. Then he discovers that his estranged son now calling himself Todd (Andy Samberg) is wealthy and about to be married to the beautiful Jamie (Leighton Meester). He knows he cant just show up and ask Todd for the money but he has a plan Maybe Donny can engineer a reunion between himself Ms. McGarricle and Todd for a broadcast of a bottom-feeding talk show hosted by Randall Morgan (Sandler pal and sports guy Dan Patrick) at the prison where shes being held. So Donny shows up for the wedding festivities uninvited horrifying Todd who has created a new identity and life for himself which includes a past in which his parents were killed in an explosion. Donny is lewd crude and generally disgusting -- and the rich uptight bunch gathered for the wedding loves him much to Todds dismay. (They think Todd is a wet blanket.) Commence with the unlikely father-son bonding achieved through drunkenness and violence excess and ear-piercing. Along the way Donny manages to uncover secrets and enrich the lives of all those he comes into contact with; hes like a dissipated wizard. Director Sean Anders and writer David Caspe try to infuse some heart into the film but come up short; theres just too much stupidity going on for it to mean anything. Sandler evidently is a loyal generous guy and this once again pays off with some interesting casting. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan plays Donnys lawyer named Jim Nance -- the name of the CBS sportscaster. The other joke here is that Nance (the movie version) is a big New England Patriots fan with a Tom Brady poster and a Bill Belichick bobblehead doll. Other notable casting includes Susan Sarandon as the older Ms. McGarricle -- shes the real-life mother of Martino who plays the younger version. Theres also Tony Orlando (but no Dawn) James Caan Todd Bridges and Erin Andrews in addition to the previously mentioned Vanilla Ice who seems to be having more fun than anyone else in the movie. There are a few laughs here and there mostly of the type that make you feel embarrassed afterward. Sandler gives Donny one of his trademark annoying accents grating from the start. To say much about the acting is probably to miss the point; this is another of those films that plays like Sandler and his friends and cohorts goofing together and charging an audience to watch. You could say that Samberg does a good job of looking embarrassed by Donny but that might not be acting. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Thats My Boy Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Sandler as daddy dearest in Thats My Boy -- Zero stars These zero-star movies of the past decade are so pathetic youll wonder how they found their way into production in the first place. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Even with 87.5 years to go the 21st century may never see a stupider comedy than""Thats My Boy.""But lets be positive and express it as a wish for the film-going masses May this century never see a stupider comedy.After squishing around in such dubious PG-13-rated hits as ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" ""Grown Ups""and ""Just Go With It""Adam Sandlers latest swings for the fences of hard-R-rated raunch just past the outfield of rancid. Deploying a Boston dialect that makes one long for the voice he came up with for the distaff half of ""Jack and Jill"" Sandler plays a party-hardy punk who at age 13 fathered a child with his sex toy of a teacher. This produces a son who grows up to be a neurotic insecure mess portrayed by Andy Samberg who quit""Saturday Night Live"" for this? Dad re-enters sons life for monetary reasons If Donny (Sandler) cant come up with 43000 fast hes off to prison for tax evasion. ""Thats My Boy"" sends Donny crashing headlong into his estranged son Todds life of wealth privilege and good taste waiting to be exploded just as Sambergs character is about to marry the wrong woman.The jokes that dont target obese people Asian-Americans and other figures of amusement involve Sandler braying or peeing or masturbating or milking the sort of pathos (Donny yearns for acceptance) that Sandlers ardent fans seem to like in their Sandler movies. Working from a script by David Caspe fledgling director Sean Anders (who co-wrote the far more buoyant""Hot Tub Time Machine"") displays a barely functioning knowledge of how to set up film and cut a sight gag. Medium shots and close-ups do not match. The cameras never in the right place. For example If youre going to show a hefty stripper eating sausage and eggs while dangling upside down from her pole it needs to be cleverer than the way its shown here. Otherwise its just depressing. The crowd at the preview screening of ""Thats My Boy"" was unusually vocal with cries of ""Nooo"" and mutterings of ""Wow"" at each new gross-out attempt. What I didnt hear was much actual laughter. More so than ""Rock of Ages""even ""Thats My Boy"" positions itself as an ""I Love the 80s"" special with supporting roles taken by Vanilla Ice Tony Orlando and others. The Sandler character is meant to be enjoyed for his pomposity-deflating boorishness admired for his skill with the babes pitied for his attempts at father/son reconciliation.

Daily Edition Login to download Thats My Boy Film Review 900 AM PDT 6/14/2012 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia Pictures A proven comedy formula thats facing diminishing returns attempts another rally. TWITTER Adam Sandler plays a former reality TV star and Andy Samberg portrays his son in the comedy directed by Sean Anders. By now a well-recognized brand unto themselves Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison production company represent a firmly entrenched comedy formula that can claim a global fan base prepared to follow wherever the laughs may lead. With enough wedding-related shenanigans to pull in the date crowd the guffaw-to-gag ratio remains relatively respectable though theres nothing here that hasnt been attempted many times over. Resistance is futile however and will hardly prevent the middling Thats My Boy from opening to brisk business most likely in the midrange of recent Sandler releases. PHOTOS 90s All Over Again Thats My Boy Premiere Draws Sandler Spade ... and Vanilla Ice Donny Berger (Sandler) is a burned-out former reality TV star with no job and practically no family at least none that who stand by him. Now well into his 40s hes infamous for having slept with his eighth-grade teacher (currently serving a 30-year sentence in the Massachusetts penal system) fathering a son with her while still a teen and leveraging his notoriety to launch a lucrative TV show and series of celebrity endorsements. But hes pissed it all away and dodged paying taxes in the process -- now he has a 43000 IRS bill that will land him in jail if he cant quickly raise the cash to pay it off. He also has neglected his son Todd (Andy Samberg) who moved away as soon as he turned 18 and hasnt spoken with his epically incompetent dad ever since. Despite his traumatic childhood and a bucketful of neuroses Todd -- whose birth name is Han Solo Berger -- is now a wealthy and successful hedge fund manager whos about to marry the woman of his dreams. The last thing he expects is for his estranged father to show up which Donny does in classic wedding-crasher style after devising an unsavory scheme to settle his tax debt. Mortified and about to see the lie hes told everyone about his deceased parents exposed Todd introduces Dad to fiancee Jamie (Leighton Meester) and her family as his best friend. Improbably Donny utterly charms the other wedding guests and is soon getting along with everyone except his son even after people recognize him as the notorious TV personality with an insatiable addiction to cheap beer. Donnys determined to see his son through an increasingly bumpy wedding weekend however as Todd is confronted by the hostility of Jamies Marine brother Chad (Milo Ventimiglia) a pugnacious priest (James Caan) and a series of mishaps leading up to some serious father-son bonding over Todds calamitous bachelor-party night out. Todds quandary over forgiving Donnys past and current transgressions begins to pale in comparison to his mounting marriage woes leaving the groom with the unenviable choice between a parent hes tried to avoid and a bride he soon might want to escape. This being an Adam Sandler comedy crude humor predominates at the expense of inherently unique situations or characters with a by-now familiar strain of sentimentality emerging in later reels. Director Sean Anders and screenwriter David Caspe follow the game plan adequately enough but the movie is overburdened with incidents that prove only mildly amusing. Anders background as an R-rated comedy writer could have served him better with shepherding the disparate cast and animating the pacing but instead the outcome is a bloated runtime that nearly tips two hours. VIDEO Thats My Boy Red-Band Trailer With Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg Hits the Web In full-on man-child mode Sandler plays a stereotypical Northeastern white-trash character recognizable from his exaggerated regional accent nonstop substance abuse profanity-dominated speech and fixation on sex. Its nothing new for Sandler who inhabits Donnys low-life personality like an alter ego alternately mugging and emoting with predictable charm. Every buddy movie needs a straight man but Samberg is rather more rigid than the role requires rarely modulating his performance enough to generate genuine hilarity. Samberg and Sandlers shared Saturday Night Live DNA barely registers and their interactions lack much of the zaniness of the TV series. Meester remains relegated to a largely functional role thats essential but hardly inspired. Deft casting that includes supporting actors Tony Orlando as Todds slimy boss Vanilla Ice as Donnys best bud and a sexy Susan Sarandon in a brief cameo as Donnys incarcerated teacher helps to enliven the overall mood. Serviceable lensing by DP Brandon Trost is marred by some inexpertly executed special effects but a soundtrack dominated by hairband rockers including Van Halen Kiss Foreigner and Def Leppard provides plenty of tuneful distraction throughout. Thats My Boy delivers the outrageous situations nonstop raunchiness and juvenile humor that Sandler fans typically seek -- for those who are actually still in the market for this particular brand of comedy.

All in all it could have been worse. Starting with the premise that statutory rape can be occasion for laughter even applause ""Thats My Boy"" is a shameless celebration of degenerate behavior a work of relentless vulgarity and staggering moral idiocy. All in all it could have been worse. Puerile crotch-fixated and very occasionally inanely funny Adam Sandlers raunchiest star vehicle in years has a small saving grace in Andy Sambergs performance as a teacher-student love-child -- an oasis of sympathy surrounded by Sandlers usual walking punchlines (minorities obese people women). Some outraged reactions can be expected; so can solid B.O. The fun begins with what amounts to a queasily comic treatment of a real-life tragicomedy specifically that 1996 headline-grabber in which schoolteacher Mary Kay Letourneau became pregnant (twice) by her 13-year-old student Vili Fualaau. In David Caspes script the poor kid -- or as the pic sees it the lucky dog -- is teenager Donny Berger (Justin Weaver) who receives a month of detention from his very hot teacher (Eva Amurri Martino) and not just because she wants her chalkboards cleaned. When the affair is discovered teacher goes to prison and Donny becomes an overnight celebrity hailed as the kid who dared to live out every boys dream. (A sign in the school auditorium ""Some have greatness thrust upon them."") The pic takes pains to make Donny the instigator of this grossly inappropriate relationship perhaps spurring some of the more contemplative members of the audience to consider the gender bias that would treat a teenage girl in similar circumstances as an unambiguous victim. Yet ""Thats My Boy"" is ultimately too stunted in its view of women to object to such a double standard. The females who flock through this picture -- a horny grandma (Peggy Stewart) a plus-size stripper (Luenell) and worst of all a spoiled rich bitch (Leighton Meester) -- are hardly worth remarking upon let alone spending time with. Ditto the Asian housekeepers and African minister who turn up on occasion preceded by a wink that lets viewers know how clued-in the pic is to its own racism. Xenophobic misogynist humor in a Happy Madison production is of course no more surprising than the pics multiple gags involving erections ejaculation incontinence public urination and vomiting. Nor is it especially shocking that Sandler plays another deplorable man-child slob with his signature high-pitched vocal inflections as though channeling a brain-damaged sock puppet. That would be Donny who has grown up to be (surprise) a deadbeat loser the lead in a ""Big Daddy"" sequel nobody requested. His son whom he christened Han Solo and neglected to the point of abuse is now a high-flying financial whiz who has changed his name to Todd (Samberg) and wants nothing to do with his dad. But just as Todd is about to get married Donny drops in and tries to rekindle their relationship kicking off a predictably painful round of humiliations for his offspring in front of his future wife and in-laws. Sambergs sweet embodiment of this poor schlub is one of the few things here that the scripts general air of hyper-sexed misanthropy cant spoil even when he and his dad bond over a crazy ""Hangover""-style bender. The thesp is the latest ""Saturday Night Live"" grad to join the Happy Madison stable (other alums/enablers in the cast include Ana Gasteyer Rachel Dratch and Colin Quinn) and he even manages to bring out an element of likability in Sandlers Donny. This is no small feat and crucial to its execution is the pics strategy of making the supporting characters so clueless/horny/reprehensible that Donny seems almost pleasant by comparison. Along similarly relativist lines we also get a gratuitously awful sex scene the apparent intention of which is to make pedophilia seem like the less revolting taboo. If theres a (faint) upside to ""Thats My Boy"" its that the crassness of the endeavor at least finds Sandler in his R-rated element after superficially less objectionable vehicles like ""Grown Ups"" and ""Jack and Jill""; his fans should be well pleased. Brief turns by Susan Sarandon and James Caan class up the proceedings and as one of Donnys washed-up celeb friends Vanilla Ice delivers an amusing if overextended cameo bearing out the pics weird affection for select 80s/90s pop-culture relics. Tech credits are wobbly though at least two gags make sharp surprising use of offscreen space.

Share Tweet Judd Apatows trenchant Funny People should have shamed Adam Sandler off appearing in idiotic high-concept schlock by casting him as a rich bored unmistakably Sandler-like movie star who makes moronic romps because he hates himself and his audience in equal measure. Instead Sandler has seemingly doubled down on his commitment to pandering to his audiences crudest instincts stopping just short of hiring his coterie of writer pals to transform the fake movies his character made in Funny People into genuine Adam Sandler vehicles. Thats My Boy casts a shaggy Sandler as an ostensibly charming sexually irresistible degenerate who has stumbled drunkenly through a life of sordid fame after knocking up his insanely hot teacher while still a boy in his early teens a development the film depicts as both innately hilarious and an awesome adolescent fantasy straight out of a Van Halen video. With the mother in jail for statutory rape Sandler is given custody of the product of their illicit union played later by Andy Samberg whos creatively neutered playing an uptight white Urkel of a character. After turning 18 Samberg distances himself from his father and his tacky tabloid heritage to become an uptight businessman on the verge of marrying a scolding Leighton Meester. Sandler re-enters his sons life after a prolonged absence on his wedding weekend seeking money to pay off a debt and a little bonding reconciliation and forgiveness in the process. At least give Thats My Boy credit for fully earning its R rating. The film represents the horny stoned drunk id lurking behind the freshly scrubbed shenanigans of the Happy Madison brand. Thats My Boy is shameless enthusiastic and terminally unoriginal in its vulgarity vomiting forth an endless string of incompetently staged and executed gross-out setpieces involving the lusty libidos of the morbidly obese mulleted and elderly most notably in the form of a running gag involving Sandlers sexual hunger for a sassy grandmother. The film is such a barren comic wasteland of scatology and misogyny that Vanilla Ice steals the film with a good-natured self-deprecating portrayal of himself as Sandlers sleazy party buddy. With Thats My Boy Sandler goes from making puerile kiddie comedies to a glorified Playboy Party Joke of a movie. Thats not progress Thats an ugly unappealing form of eternal adolescence.
