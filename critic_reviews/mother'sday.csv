Comments click to enlarge Mothers Day Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2016 Director Garry Marshall continues his streak of holiday romances (Valentines Day New Years Eve) with another star-studded woman-targeted movie thats as flimsy and trite as a Hallmark card. A divorced mom (Jennifer Aniston) is friends with a married mom (Kate Hudson) who is friends with an unmarried mom (Britt Robertson) and the first of these keeps meeting cute with a widowed dad (Jason Sudeikis) so attractive white people with beautiful homes and bourgeois problems are widely represented. Bigoted grandparents introduce issues of racism and homophobia which are handled with sitcom hamminess and then neatly resolved. Some may delight in the references to earlier comedies by Marshall (Pretty Woman) and his sister Penny (A League of Their Own) but the jokes settle at the level of Sudeikiss groan-worthy quip ""Theres no texting in soccer"" With Julia Roberts Timothy Olyphant Shay Mitchell and as always Hector Elizondo.

"Mothers Day - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Mothers Day Posted by Christy Lemire on May 2 2016 3 Comments Open Road Films Rated PG-13 for language and some suggestive material. Running time 118 minutes. One half star out of four. ""Mothers Day"" is so terrible that it inspired me to start my list of the worst movies of 2016. January and February are traditionally dumping-ground time so a lot of truly awful movies usually have paraded past my eyes by this time each year. But ""Mothers Day"" felt like a particular milestone one that I wanted to commemorate with great alacrity -- like as soon as the credits started rolling and I could turn my phone back on again. Garry Marshall just needs to stay away from holidays altogether. ""Mothers Day"" is the veteran directors third ensemble comedy based on a beloved event on the calendar following ""Valentines Day"" (2010) and ""New Years Eve"" (2011). I had vague hope that this one might actually be better given that it didnt come from the writer of those first two movies. But they just keep getting worse. The wacky antics and mawkish sentimentality of A-listers colliding into each other have given way to complete incoherence this time around. There isnt a single authentic moment in this entire movie which mindbogglingly runs all of two hours. As a mother myself in my early 40s I am your target audience and I did not witness anything that moved me in any emotional direction beyond extreme discomfort. There is exactly one scene that maybe kinda-sorta works briefly and thats just because Julia Roberts is really good at crying on cue. Basically Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson and Britt Robertson and Sarah Chalke and Margo Martindale are moms and Roberts might be a mom and Shay Mitchell is a stepmom and Jason Sudeikis is a dad. They all live in Atlanta where their lives intertwine in ways that are both contrived and mundane and where its warm much of the time giving Aniston and Hudson the opportunity to exercise outdoors quite a bit (in pieces from Hudsons Fabletics line of workout gear no doubt). Aniston stars as Sandy whos amicably divorced from Timothy Olyphants Henry with whom she has two young sons. (One of them has asthma which will provide a crucial plot point later. Its like Chekhovs Inhaler.) But Henry recently has eloped with his much younger girlfriend the bombshell Tina (Mitchell) which sends Sandy into a cliched middle-aged panic of shrill existential angst. Sandy also happens to be friends with Hudsons character Jesse whos secretly married to a man of Indian descent (Aasif Mandvi) because her conservative racist parents in Texas (Martindale and Robert Pine) wouldnt approve. She also has a child with his man which is also a secret. Across the street Jesses sister (Sarah Chalke) is also secretly a wife and mother -- with her longtime partner a woman named Max (Cameron Esposito). When Mom and Dad pull up to Jesses house in their RV unannounced madcap hilarity ensues. ""Mothers Day"" might be trying to show how diverse and progressive it is in representing every kind of family but its a laugh track away from ""Threes Company"" levels of subterfuge. (The script for the record comes from Anya Kochoff Romano Matt Walker and Tom Hines.) Robertson meanwhile plays a cocktail waitress named Kristin. Shes the mother of an infant with her longtime boyfriend Zack (Jack Whitehall) a Brit who also happens to be the least funny stand-up comedian in America. His lame sets are prime examples of the excruciatingly awkward editing strategy at work here with repeated cutaways to audience members laughing hysterically at moments when Zack isnt even telling an actual joke. Finally theres Sudeikis as a recent widower named Bradley. His wife (Jennifer Garner seen only in cheesy karaoke video footage during a moment of reminiscence) was a Marine lieutenant who died in battle in Afghanistan leaving him to raise the couples two daughters alone. Ten bucks if you can figure out which single-mom character hell eventually end up with. Roberts flits in and out of these storylines as Miranda Collins a home-shopping style maven who peddles jewelry including cheap-looking pendants that change color depending on your mood. She may be related to somebody else in ""Mothers Day""; her close-cropped orange bob however is related to no human being on the planet. (But Marshall who directed Roberts to super-stardom a quarter century ago in ""Pretty Woman"" does manage to wring the movies one fleeting decent moment out of her here too.) Marshall veers wildly between hokey moments that are meant to be humorous and saccharine moments that are meant to be sentimental. Sudeikis painful rap routine to a sanitized version of ""The Humpty Dance"" is meant to be both simultaneously. The characters never feel like real people even though theyre constantly explaining themselves to us. (""I have abandonment issues"" Kristin says while discussing why she wont marry Zack.) And their antics are lighted in a flat bright way that creates a distracting feeling of detachment. If you love your mother -- or even if you hate your mother -- take her to see something else this Mothers Day. A revival of ""Mommie Dearest"" maybe.

I like a lot of Garry Marshalls work. And would have liked to take my mom to see it. Ill look for a theater showing Joy instead. LOVED it. Great portrait of a committed mom. Reply May 6 2016  by  Christian DiMartino     Yes yes yes and yes. I had a 7.50 coupon to see one of three movies The Boss My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and this one. Slim pickings I know. But the only one I hadnt seen was this one so I thought what the hell. And after seeing it I have to once again say what the hell? This is easily one of the years worst movies so far and I also started making my worst of the year list after seeing it. Half a star is honestly too generous. Nothing about this movie works. I loved your review perfectly said. Reply May 8 2016  by  Gwyn     Youre review sums it up perfectly. My daughter bought us tickets in an Event Cinema something we treat ourselves to once or twice a year. The movie was painful and awkward Anistons scene in the car was so lame. The best thing about the movie was the thought and effort my daughter put into the day Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Courtesy Open Road Films A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Is it too much to ask that all these holiday-themed rom-coms -- Valentines Day New Years Eve and now Mothers Day -- one day merge with the Halloween movies? Michael Myers might be the only one in either franchise with a truly cutting response to all the rhetorical musings about relationships romantic familial and platonic. Like the feature-length version of a last-minute gift (which for many is exactly what itll end up being) Garry Marshalls latest seems like a nice enough rose until you actually get a whiff of its gas-station chintziness. Its fine that the makeshift trilogy (please let it only be a trilogy) is a simple-minded ode to love meant to send everyone home happy. So why doesnt it actually send anyone home happy?This time Marshall presents a cross-section of moms married (Kate Hudson) divorced (Jennifer Aniston) young (Britt Robertson) old (Margo Martindale) -- even dead (Jennifer Garner for some reason). Not included among the A-list ensemble attempting to enliven the Hallmark Channel-grade script is almost anyone of color; this is an Atlanta-set dramedy in which every major character is white. The screenwriters fashion this intersecting narrative as an anthemic statement about how we treat the people we love but focusing exclusively on upper-middle-class life undercuts the films presumptions of universality.Film Details Mothers Day RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time118 min. More Info Trailer Loosely connecting the needlessly long list of characters is Julia Roberts as a Home Shopping Network shill on everyones TVs. They all admire her glamorous lifestyle which according to romantic-comedy logic means her personal life turns out to be even sadder than theirs.From one scene to the next youre likely to forget not only who a given character is but who he or she is in relation to the other archetypes you wont much care about. But Marshall is eager to remind you. One of these is a stand-up comic (Jack Whitehall and dont get your hopes up his jokes arent funny) whose girlfriend/mother of his child (Robertson) wont marry him because as she tearfully tells Hudson while their kids play ""I have abandonment issues."" If thats not overt enough try the scene in which Jason Sudeikis (as Garners widower) watches a video of his departed wife singing karaoke so that his daughter can walk in the room and helpfully inform us that ""Mom loved karaoke.""Most of the laughs are unintentional. Aniston and Sudeikis make the best of what theyre given but theyre fighting an uphill battle. By far the highest concentration of actual humor comes during the blooper reel over the end credits; free of the scripts saccharine constraints the performers immediately demonstrate their chops.The screenplays series of life-affirming contrivances is far longer than the list of funny lines Everyone spends the first half of the film asking one another how theyre spending the holiday in question but no one is busy when Sudeikis throws an impromptu party and invites everyone he knows. If mom has good taste shell probably be pissed you didnt take her to see The Family Fang instead.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Apr 29 2016 Culture Its hard to know where to begin with Mothers Day a misshapen Frankenstein of a movie that feels like it escaped the Hallmark headquarters halfway through its creation and rampaged into theaters trying to teach audiences how to love. The third in Garry Marshalls increasingly strange ""holiday anthology"" series Mothers Day isnt the rom-com hodge-podge that Valentines Day was or the bizarre morass of his follow-up New Years Eve. But it does inspire the kind of revolted tingling that strikes at say a karaoke performance gone very wrong. Related Story The Inventor of Mothers Day Disowned the Holiday and So Should We All While its aiming for frothiness and fun Mothers Day is a patronizing and sickly sweet endeavor that widely misses the mark for its entire 118-minute running time (it feels much longer). The audience gets the sense that there are many Big Truths to be learned that family harmony is important that its good to accept different lifestyles without judgment that loss is a natural part of the circle of life. But its overall construction--as a work of cinema--always feels a little off. One character gets a life lesson from a clown at a childrens party and departs with a hearty ""Thanks clown"" Extras wander in the background and deliver halting bits of expositional dialogue like malfunctioning robots. Half of the lines seem to have been recorded post-production and are practically shouted from off-screen to patch over a narrative that makes little sense. Mothers Day is bad in the regular ways (e.g. the acting and writing) but also in that peculiar way where it feels as though the films creator has never met actual humans before.Like its predecessors Mothers Day boasts an all-star ensemble of characters who ping-pong around a general theme in celebration of the titular holiday. Theres Jennifer Aniston as Sandy a divorced mom whose chiseled ex (Timothy Olyphant) has moved on to someone younger. Kate Hudson plays Jesse whos committed the unforgivable sin of marrying a non-white man (Aasif Mandvi) which has estranged her from her conservative Texan parents. Jason Sudeikis is Bradley a soldier mourning the loss of his wife whose cute daughters need him to snap out of his sad reverie. These heroes and many more are constantly tuned into the Home Shopping Network to watch the lifestyle-guru stylings of Miranda (Julia Roberts) a sweater-caped extra-terrestrial who hawks junky bracelets and mood pendants with all the charisma of a coma patient. Will she be important to the central plot later? Of course she will.Mothers Day is creepily patronizing and sickly sweet endeavor that widely misses the mark.Mothers Day is set in Atlanta an astonishing choice considering the blinding whiteness of the ensemble picked to represent this majority-black city (the only African American character is played by the comedian Loni Love). Still Marshall and the films four credited screenwriters take it upon themselves to have characters deliver bland lectures on racism and homophobia to the films one-dimensional ""villains"" Jesses red-state parents. Their other daughter Jesses sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) outdid her siblings marital transgression by marrying a woman (played by the comedian Cameron Esposito). Mothers Day is looking for easy applause by castigating Jesse and Gabis parents (played by Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) who roll around in an RV and wear various themed t-shirts that could have been purchased at a Donald Trump rally. But theyre far too cartoonish to stand in for any real-life debate and by the end everyone discovers the virtues of tolerance anyway.Anistons character Sandy seems to embody the unfortunate gossip-rag view of her real life Shes a harried 40-something replaced by a younger model (the buxom Tina played by Shay Mitchell). Sandy struggles to juggle the various commitments of her two sons kvetches about her ex-husband at yoga class and gets an instant case of word-diarrhea the minute shes speaking to an eligible single man (in this case Sudeikis). At one point her kids fuss over leaving her to hang out with her father saying ""But youre so sad"" as if theyre suddenly the editorial board of The National Enquirer. Films like Mothers Day seem to deploy this frumpy-mom stereotype for automatic audience relatability but its yet another horrendously hackneyed trope in a film already filled with them.The rest of the ensemble feel as though theyre sleepwalking including younger stars like Britt Robertson who plays a new mother searching for the woman who gave her up for adoption. (Guess who?) Sudeikis too seems to equate ""grief"" with ""looking tired all the time"" or perhaps it was too difficult to tap into his characters sadness about his wife (whos revealed as a celebrity cameo) given such a poor script. Unlike with the rom-com Valentines Day theres no clear genre angle to shoot for here to make the film feel like a cohesive whole. Each vignette stumbles toward a conclusion of sorts with the films only consistency being an immense smugness Here is a movie that has bravely dared to declare that mothers (and wives and daughters) deserve our love and attention and respect. For viewers who need tacky films to teach them basic lessons like that in totally artless fashion well theres always the possibility of a Fathers Day sequel.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

"Mothers Day review Your mom deserves better - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Mothers Day review Your mom deserves better Trailer Mothers Day Watch the official trailer for ""Mothers Day."" (ScreenPlay) Watch the official trailer for ""Mothers Day."" (ScreenPlay) Katie WalshTribune News Service It seems theres no stopping Garry Marshalls terrifying cinematic rampage on our nations treasured holidays. Having ruined both ""Valentines Day"" and ""New Years Eve"" with his star-packed omnibus projects the director has burned his way through the calendar landing on ""Mothers Day"" as his next victim.This time around Julia Roberts Jennifer Aniston Kate Hudson Jason Sudeikis Britt Robertson Margo Martindale Timothy Olyphant Aasif Mandvi Sarah Chalke and Shay Mitchell among others are subjected to the inter-connected fake heartwarming holiday themed story. It claims to be a tribute to the idea of maternal love but its not even heartwarming or about mothers so much. Sure most of the characters are parents but its only nominally about motherhood. ""Mothers Day"" is far more concerned with exploring the ideas of marriage careers single dads the military prejudice jealousy grief and clown wisdom than it is about motherhood. There are a few tossed off lines about the irreplaceability of a mothers love but nothing feels sincere.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR The script is credited to no less than four people and is a shoddy mishmash of product placement for a bizarre selection of brands from Mortons Salt to Cadillac; theres blatantly spoken exposition and personal psychoanalysis terribly edited bits of dialogue stuffed in to make everything more painfully obvious -- ""I have abandonment issues"" a character needlessly explains.For the humor ""Mothers Day"" relies on a hearty dose of generational and gender panic. The characters panic about tampons social media texting teen dating and the wearing of shorts. Not to mention the fit about gay people and Indians that the parents of Jessie (Kate Hudson) and Gabby (Sarah Chalke) throw when they find out that their daughters are married to an Indian man and a woman respectively. The racist and homophobic comments they make (ever think youd hear ""towelhead"" in a family comedy? Theres a first time for everything) are rightfully called out as offensive but their depiction as intolerant domestic beer-swilling trailer trash just might be more offensive to Texans.In the film the actual holiday of Mothers Day ends up being a pretty terrible day for all involved including two ER trips and a runaway RV chase. Its possible the day is OK for two of the characters who possibly get married on that day but its impossible to tell because there is no logic to the space and time of this film. Someone takes an Uber from Las Vegas to Atlanta in seemingly a matter of minutes.We are also granted one of the most surreal moments of recent cinema when single dad Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) wildly overcorrects his initial lack of enthusiasm for the holiday due to his wifes death. Stuffing the house full of flowers and balloons (""He must have used his veterans discount at Pro Flowers"" pal Kimberly dutifully intones) he gives his teen girls a car and a karaoke machine with which he performs a rousing rendition of the classic hip-hop tune ""The Humpty Dance."" He dances with his teenage daughters. While singing ""The Humpty Dance."" At a Mothers Day party. ""Mothers Day"" is a total mess but whats truly offensive is that they didnt even try to make this cynical post-Sunday brunch cash grab even remotely watchable.

Mothers Day Can someone make director Garry Marshall quit killing holidays before its too late? Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson are two of the moms in Garry Marshalls dreary star-studded Mothers Day omnibus. Credit Ron Batzdorff By Peter Travers April 28 2016 More News The Rolling Stone Interview Julia Roberts Jennifer Aniston The Girl Friend Justifieds Timothy Olyphant on Ending the Show How Tom Hiddleston Makes Psycho Sexy All Stories >> Director Garry Marshall is a menace. He keeps killing holidays with all-star comedies in which a laugh would die of loneliness. First Valentines Day and New Years Eve got the Marshall treatment. Now Mothers Day takes the hit from Marhalls marauders out to trick a bunch of poor movie-loving moms to take a chance on this turkey on their special day. More News The Rolling Stone Interview Julia Roberts Jennifer Aniston The Girl Friend Justifieds Timothy Olyphant on Ending the Show How Tom Hiddleston Makes Psycho Sexy All Stories >> Related 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 From superhero movies and serious dramas to a new Star Wars movie the years must-sees The focus here is on moms living in Atlanta Georgia and feeling angsty in the lead up to Mothers Day. First up is Jennifer Aniston whose natural comic flair is defeated by her role as a mom having a meltdown because her ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) is marrying a tween. Not really but Shay Mitchell of Pretty Little Liars looks jailbaity enough to get the point across. Kate Hudson has it worse in the stereotype department. She and her sister (Sarah Chalke) are keeping their children secret from their racist homophobic Texas parents. One sister is married to a doctor from India (Asif Mandvi) and the other is living with - yikes - a woman (Cameron Esposito). Every bigot joke is trotted out and beaten in the service of laughs that never come. Jennifer Garner is facing even more dire prospects for Mothers Day. Shes dead a soldier killed in Afghanistan leaving her husband (Jason Sudeikis) to pine away while watching home videos of his wife (Garner pushes perky so far you want to scream) and ignoring the effect of his self-pity on his two impressionable daughters. Are you laughing yet? You will when you see Julia Roberts. Well not at Roberts exactly but at the ugly-ass page-boy wig she is forced to wear in every scene and that makes her look like a female impersonator. Is Roberts repaying Marshall for the star-making role he gave her in Pretty Woman? If so hes asked too much. Roberts is playing a home-shopping guru who has chosen career over motherhood. Or has she? Is there a secret in her past? Is there a cliche in this script that Marshall hasnt unearthed? Id say find out for yourself. But I wouldnt be that mean to anyone on Mothers Day.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 29 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 29 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Garry Marshall Written by Tom Hines Anya Kochoff Romano and Matt Walker Starring Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson Classification PG Country USA Language English One imagines Garry Marshall gathering his gleaming cast together early. ""Julia Roberts"" ol Gare would shout to his pal from the Pretty Woman past ""I want you to ACT."" And then to the Jennifer Anistons Jason Sudeikises and Kate Hudsons of the world ""The rest of you"" waving his hand ""not so much."" Easy peasy for Marshall who majored in television comedy and now minors in holiday-based ensemble-cast romcom confection (2010s Valentines Day and 2011s New Years Eve). Set in Pottery Barn America - affluent suburban Atlanta actually - Mothers Day finds white people in May dealing with mommy issues of all different kinds. Anistons cutely raging character for example struggles to share her little boys with an ex-husbands much younger new wife. Sudeikis plays a dad who stops obsessing over his dead soldier wife long enough to (hilariously) purchase his daughters tampons. And Roberts is Miranda a celebrity entrepreneur who as a teenager gave her only daughter away for adoption. Mothers Day is a concocted market-driven holiday and so is this Mamp;Ms-obsessed movie - candy for the sweet-toothed among us.

Its an embarrassment for everyone involved and thats well before Sudeikis breaks his leg while doing karaoke to ""The Humpty Dance"" (seriously dont ask).The characters eventual ties are all telegraphed very early on the only surprises are how much dreck viewers are asked to choke down before theyre revealed.""Mothers Day"" is not a tribute to mothers.

Kate Hudson and Sarah Chalke in Garry Marshalls ""Mothers Day."" Photo Ron Batzdorff Associated Press Mothers Day no holiday bouquet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery When you sit down to watch a Garry Marshall movie you know what youre getting A nice world with nice people in which the jokes arent funny and yet are clearly identifiable as well-meaning attempts at humor. There are lurches into sentiment that stand in for actual feeling social attitudes that are benign but weird and a multistar cast full of actors who seem to be having a good time. That said ""Mothers Day"" is about as bad as a movie can be without being remotely obnoxious. Its mostly pleasing or at least pleasant. No human being is quite human. No adult is quite adult. No situation completely makes sense. But the overall aura is kind of ... welcoming. Its impossible to take seriously but easy to take. If youre keeping score this is the third in Marshalls holiday trilogy and it occupies a space somewhere in between the pretty good ""Valentines Day"" (2010) and the awful ""New Years Eve"" (2011). Like its predecessors it has a big cast full of various loosely connected characters going through big life events on the way to a holiday. Jennifer Aniston is a divorced wife and mother with a barely concealed desire to get back together with her suave husband (Tim Olyphant). Jason Sudeikis is a widower with two children still grieving the death of his wife (Jennifer Garner who shows up in one scene on video). Britt Robertson is a young mother who is reluctant to marry her boyfriend. And Julia Roberts is a cold hard-driving home shopping entrepreneur who seemingly has nothing to do with the other characters -- but wait a while. Most peculiar of all are the sisters played by Kate Hudson and Sarah Chalke who have moved across the country to keep their personal lives secret from their racist homophobic parents One is married to an Indian (Aasif Mandvi) and the other is married to a woman (Cameron Esposito). All is well until Mom and Dad (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) show up uninvited and react in the ugly way their daughters expected. Its hard to know who gets it worse. The older couple is like a red-state stereotype as seen through blue-state eyes. On the other hand their nastiness and bigotry are forgotten and forgiven by the other characters as though it were a temporary indiscretion. Like so much of this film the humor and the characters seem off. On three occasions for example someone goes out and does a stand-up routine that has the audience laughing with delight -- that is the audience within the movie -- but the jokes arent funny. How is this possible? This is Garry Marshall. This is the man who created ""The Odd Couple"" TV series among other successful comedies. He knows whats funny -- at least I assume he does. Then again you know what happens when you assume. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. Email mlasallesfchronicle.com. Twitter MickLaSalle Mothers Day Comedy.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Garry Marshall is at least nominally an actors director. His early career in sitcoms made him a specialist in helping stars find a persona. He directed Julia Roberts to her most famous performance in Pretty Woman. Hes worked as a character actor himself. Hes also engendered enough comfort and loyalty to recruit all-star casts for three separate holiday-themed interconnected-ensemble comedies of which Mothers Day is the latest following Valentines Day and New Years Eve. Its grimly fascinating then to see how this actor-friendly filmmaker manages to direct so many recognizable stars to such terrible performances. Mothers Day in contention for Marshalls worst holiday parade becomes an unintentional meditation on the hollowness of stardom as name actors ghost their way through imitations of their past triumphs. Collectively Jennifer Aniston Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson the three biggest stars in Mothers Day represent decades and dozens of romantic comedies and domestic dramedies. Yet this movie never feels like the work of old pros or young pros or anyone of any age with much acting experience. Because the characters are played by movie stars they do feel familiar especially Sandy (Aniston) whose easygoing ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) has remarried a younger woman who gets access to Sandys kids without putting in any of the hard work. Anistons self-pitying persona emerges in full force and is stripped of any meager comic potential. Her entire shtick consists of disdainfully repeating words as if theyre the keys to her unceasing misery whether its the name of her would-be rival (""Tina"") vexing young-person technology used by her would-be rival (""tweet"") or the subject of a supposed joke (when shes talking to a birthday party clown she says ""clown"" over and over).Aniston is bad here but shes not alone. Marshall allows everyone in the movie to either play to their worst instincts or avert their eyes while skipping through the wreckage. As a home-shopping celebrity hiding a secret Roberts mugs unbearably for her show within the film then goes stiff for her big emotional scenes later in the picture. Jason Sudeikis playing a widower raising two daughters looks narcotized not with grief but with indifference. Kate Hudson as Anistons friend Jesse comes off the best simply by not appearing in much of her storyline wherein her bigoted parents (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) learn that shes married to an Indian man (Aasif Mandavi) and that her sister (Sarah Chalke) is married to a woman. That faint sense of inclusiveness is one of the few things Mothers Day has going for it. But then most of the movies writing is so terrible that a lack of outright hate speech starts to feel like a major positive. Lots of bad movies use bad spoken exposition but it takes a special kind of screenplay one written by a klatch of Marshall hangers-on to make it sound not just awkward but repetitive and almost confusingly descriptive as if written for blind children. Some of the information-imparting gems include ""Im your sister and I live next door to you"" ""I have abandonment issues"" ""Theres a reason we moved here to Georgia"" (the movie goes on to name-check its tax-credit location repeatedly but never more specifically than saying Atlanta Georgia) and ""Mom loved karaoke"" (which leads to a later moment where a character helpfully explains ""Its a karaoke machine"" twice in about two minutes). At least these lines have the clear (if insulting) purpose of explaining every detail to the dummies in the audience. In other scenes the actors seem to be talking around the situations at hand like they didnt have time to memorize the screenplays reams of exposition and just had to wing it. Maybe this accounts for the mismatched grammar in exchanges like this ""Who is giving this young lady away?"" ""I do."" As many grammatical mistakes as the movie makes its possible even more were fixed because it also seems to contain an unusual amount of ADR. Or does Marshall just not like showing his actors mouths moving? His cutting makes it hard to tell.His cutting along with his framing and timing also makes it hard to tell even the simplest jokes. At one point Olyphant engages in a bit of slapstick so mild that the gag is 20 percent soft cushioned pratfall and 80 percent reaction shots (including one of a llama). Sometimes Marshall and his writers room give up on the hard work of forging their own hacky gags and settle for references to other films from the Marshall dynasty like a Pretty Woman ""salad fork"" non sequitur between Roberts and Marshalls smug mascot Hector Elizondo or a scene where Sudeikis must wanly refer to A League Of Their Own (directed by Marshalls sister Penny) by announcing that ""Theres no texting in soccer.""Its hard for a comedy to be so bad its funny but Mothers Day gets there more than once through a combination of sheer incompetence and desperate emotion; the only thing its worse at than setting up and delivering jokes is yanking on the heartstrings. The film starts out with an advantage over its predecessors in that its free to explore a variety of familial relationships rather than single-mindedly fancying itself some kind of ultimate all-encompassing romantic comedy. But in Marshalls hands this distinction doesnt matter one bit. This whole world is one big romantic comedy which in his hands means a sappy greeting card that isnt particularly funny. The mother-child bonds dont even register because most of them are actually about the absence and/or symbolic value of a mother not actual relationships.All those actors must find some degree of well-paid comfort in this numbing stupidity though by the end of Mothers Day its worth asking whether Marshall and his cronies constitute some kind of hostage-taking Hollywood mafia forever calling in favors to get another vanity project running. Maybe its time for some of them to start planning exit strategies. Jennifer Garner a Valentines Day veteran has a cameo here as Sudeikis departed wife--a U.S. Marine of course because all three of Marshalls holiday epics pay mawkish tribute to the troops. (Here a shot of Garners gravestone is tastefully adorned with stirring military drumbeats.) In other words the sweet release of her characters death spares Garner the humiliation of appearing in more than one scene of Mothers Day (though not the humiliation of sentimental onscreen karaoke). Roberts Aniston Hudson Sudeikis and everyone else should start plotting their characters gruesome demises before they get the call for Memorial Day.

Open Road Films photo Star-studded Mothers Day doesnt say much about motherhood By Jody Mitori Special to Go Magazine Apr 28 2016 (...) Julia Roberts (left) and Jennifer Aniston in ""Mothers Day."" Open Road Films photo As another holiday approaches so does another holiday-themed comedy from director Garry Marshall. First it was ""Valentines Day"" (2010) then ""New Years Eve"" (2011) and now ""Mothers Day"" a film that crams together a lot of stereotypical mothers without saying much about motherhood.Divorced mom? Check. Lesbian mom? Check. Old mom? Young mom? Dead mom? Yes yes and yes.Jennifer Aniston anchors the star-filled ensemble as Sandy a mother of two who is struggling with the new marriage of her ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) and his young wife (Shay Mitchell). Sandy is friends with Jesse (Kate Hudson) who has been hiding her Indian-American husband (Aasif Mandvi) and their biracial son from her parents (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) for years. Widower Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is trying to raise two daughters while dealing with his grief. But these characters are so paper-thin its surprising they even have names. They live in the Land of Beautiful Kitchens where mothers work out a lot and seem to have half-hour work days. The only woman who identifies herself as a career woman is Home Shopping Network star Miranda (Julia Roberts). We know she is successful because she sports a severe haircut has razor-straight posture and snaps at her weary agent (Hector Elizondo). The draw of ensembles is the chance to see favorite actors appear together in one movie but here more isnt better. Instead the film serves as a reminder of better work the cast members have done together -- Martindale and Olyphant in acclaimed TV series ""Justified"" Roberts and Elizondo in the 1990 hit ""Pretty Woman"" and even Aniston and Sudeikis in the so-so ""Horrible Bosses.""And while the film is supposedly about parenthood most of the characters with the exception of Sudeikis Bradley dont show much of a connection to their children. Odd that in a film called ""Mothers Day"" a father goes through the biggest change.

VPCJennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson star in ""Mothers Day.""(Photo Ron Batzdorff)Unless your mom has an extremely low bar for movie satisfaction its best to do her a favor and skip a date to Mothers Day.Director Garry Marshalls latest effort ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) to ape the holiday-themed intertwined-tale magic of 2003s Love Actually -- Valentines Day (2010) New Years Eve (2011) etc. -- may boast a star-studded cast but its a spectacular dud on every other level with tonal whiplash a little casual racism played for jokes and a script seemingly pulled from Hallmark cards rejected for being too hokey.Honestly Independence Day has less disasters than this movie does.USA TODAYMothers Day is all about family for director Garry MarshallThe plot is a melange of motherly melancholy. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a frustrated Atlanta interior designer wrestling with the thought of sharing her two boys after her ex (Timothy Olyphant) marries a much younger woman (Shay Mitchell). Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a gym owner with two girls and a hole in his heart a year after his military wifes death. Kristin (Britt Robertson) has abandonment issues so shes in no hurry to marry Zack (Jack Whitehall) the British bartending father of her infant. And Jesse (Kate Hudson) whos married to an Indian doctor (Aasif Mandvi) and her lesbian sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) keep their families secret from their redneck mom (Margo Martindale) -- which becomes an issue when she shows up unannounced.The stories are loosely connected though one thread is actually a character Julia Roberts Miranda is an Oprah-level home-shopping maven who hawks mood jewelry. One of the few interesting characters of the whole piece she has a big reveal that while not a shocker is at least a smidgen nuanced compared to the predictable fluff that came before it.USA TODAYIt was a Pretty Woman reunion at the Mothers Day premierePainfully overlong and overstuffed Mothers Day tries to do too much with a variety of storytelling gymnastics laughable dialogue and one-dimensional characters. Theyre a neurotic mostly unrelatable bunch so when the overtly apparent emotional manipulation comes -- and oh does it ever -- the feels are mostly fleeting.The closest it comes to being a real tearjerker is a third-act moment with Miranda and a scene involving Zack his cute baby and a comedy club. Its almost enough to make you forget that the infant spends most of the movie in bars.Marshall one of the great creative minds of Hollywood and the man behind Happy Days and Mork amp; Mindy back in the day offers a modern wink at his sister Pennys A League of Their Own -- ""Theres no texting in soccer"" -- and even pays homage to his own work with Hector Elizondo playing a confidante to Roberts character much like that in Pretty Woman. Instead of a smart nod its more of a reminder of what Marshall did before his current obsession for calendar-ready interlocking schlock.At this rate Flag Day may not even be safe. 140 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1TznBCR",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/04/28/review-mothers-day-movie/83564418/,200,mother'sday11,mother'sday,usatoday

Not only is that a line uttered in the first five minutes of Mothers Day but it also seems to be the entire thought process behind the decision to make the movie. Garry Marshalls latest star-heavy plot-light ensemble film seems to follow the belief that a holiday about mothers is enough to engage audiences and make them so invested in the characters--despite zero character development--that they wont notice any offensive comments choppy dialogue lifeless jokes or planted attempts at sincerity. The film follows a variety of mothers in the days leading up to the holiday. Theres Jennifer Anistons divorced mother whose husband remarries a hot twentysomething. Theres Jason Sudeikis single father whose children lost their mother just a year ago. Or perhaps you prefer Julia Roberts non-mother who gave up her child and went instead for a career. (Because women cant have both.) And if none of those resonate with you theres also the new mother whose own adoption has scarred her to the point of not wanting to connect with the father of her child. How about a pair of bigoted parents from Texas who wear American flag T-shirts and cant fathom the idea that their two daughters could have fallen in love with -- gasp -- someone whos not white and -- gasp -- a woman. Sure at this point you can make the argument that fans know what to expect when they enter a Garry Marshall film. But unlike Valentines Day and New Years Eve Mothers Day cant even manage to establish a cheesy romance worth rooting for. All it manages is a few unintended laughs some truly awkward musical cues and forcing Aniston to utter the line ""Thanks clown."" If you love your mother do not make her see this movie.

"Mothers Day is a monotonous and predictable group therapy session - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Mothers Day is a monotonous and predictable group therapy session Mothers Day Ron Batzdorff /Open Road Films via AP Kate Hudson and Aasif Mandvi in ""Mothers Day."" Kate Hudson and Aasif Mandvi in ""Mothers Day."" (Ron Batzdorff /Open Road Films via AP) Justin ChangLos Angeles Times Film Critic Much of the pre-release chatter around ""Mothers Day"" the latest holiday-themed group therapy session from director Garry Marshall (""Valentines Day"" ""New Years Eve"") has focused on the subject of Julia Roberts hair -- specifically the strawberry-blond Anna Wintour bob that her character wears throughout. As the diligent investigators at People recently confirmed Roberts donned the exact same wig 17 years ago for a brief scene in ""Notting Hill"" in which she played an actress playing an astronaut in an outer-space thriller called ""Helix.""For some fans all this hair talk may trigger a flood of nostalgia for the 90s when Roberts long almost Samsonian curls -- seen to especially voluminous effect in ""Pretty Woman"" her first collaboration with Marshall -- signaled a star at the height of her cultural and commercial supremacy. But the ""Helix"" flashback also serves another purpose which is to identify the genre to which ""Mothers Day"" properly belongs. Its not a romantic dramedy; its science fiction. Our complete summer movie guide gt; Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link The setting is a well-furnished comfortably upper-middle-class planet that vaguely resembles our own albeit with conspicuously more flowers swimming pools and exercise equipment. For all the on-screen laughter and tears the air feels strained sinister and charged with desperation. There are a few nonwhite actors in the cast -- Aasif Mandvi plays a frazzled dad and Anoush NeVart shows up as his saucy sari-wearing mother -- but they are generally treated as comic anomalies to be identified and eliminated as quickly as possible sort of like the replicants in ""Blade Runner."" Meanwhile even the ensembles native English speakers approach their dialogue in the stilted uncomprehending manner of people behaving under the possible influence of nerve gas. And what they mainly chatter about -- with a monotony that wears perilously thin over the course of almost two hours -- is Mothers Day Mothers Day Mothers Day and all the attendant pressures and anxieties that are stirred up in its annual wake. ""Youre really doing whats best for the kids."" ""I have abandonment issues."" ""No matter whats happened between us youre always my mother."" ""I was adopted."" ""I came from a sperm donor."" And finally ""This is all so stupid."" Mothers Day trailer Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston star in ""Mothers Day"" in theaters April 29. Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston star in ""Mothers Day"" in theaters April 29. See more videos Quite so. From awkward start to merciful finish ""Mothers Day"" is a grim listless affair that may leave you pining for the relative pep and coherence of its predecessors (both of which were scripted by Katherine Fugate) or at least a few of their incidental pleasures. Theres no one here as memorably off-key as Taylor Swift in ""Valentines Day"" and the blooper reel doesnt have a single throwaway gag as charming as Zac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer tearing up the dance floor in ""New Years Eve."" What the movie does have is a new trio of screenwriters (Anya Kochoff Romano Matthew Walker and Tom Hines) who have duly reproduced the Fugate formula of serving up five or six pedestrian movies for the price of one.Roberts plays Miranda Collins whose name suggests a combination fashion-magazine editor and trash-romance novelist; instead shes a home-shopping-network celebrity who hawks a line of crystal mood pendants while keeping her own emotions tightly under wraps. At the opposite end of the social spectrum is Kristin (Britt Robertson ""Tomorrowland"") who has a baby with her British bartender boyfriend Zack (Jack Whitehall) but keeps turning down his marriage proposals. You almost understand why after enduring a few of Zacks stand-up comedy routines which occasion some of the least persuasive laugh-track accompaniment in recent memory.The closest thing to a fully developed character falls to the ever-appealing Jennifer Aniston as an interior decorator named Sandy who fears losing her two boys when her ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) marries a twentysomething bombshell (Shay Mitchell). Meanwhile Sandy carries on an awkward semi-flirtation with Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) a gym owner whos having trouble raising his two daughters nearly a year after their mother (Jennifer Garner) died in military service overseas. Mothers Day Ron Batzdorff / Open Road Films Julia Roberts left and Jennifer Aniston in ""Mothers Day."" Julia Roberts left and Jennifer Aniston in ""Mothers Day."" (Ron Batzdorff / Open Road Films) The plight of Americas troops abroad has long been a fixture of this franchise -- Roberts played a soldier in ""Valentines Day"" as did Common in ""New Years Eve"" -- and its not the only respect in which ""Mothers Day"" tries to cultivate a heartland-specific appeal. Tellingly this is the first movie in the series set not in Los Angeles or New York but in Atlanta (not that youd necessarily know it from Marshalls flat generic visuals).That geographical shift introduces some stereotypical Southern prejudice in the form of a subplot involving Jesse (Kate Hudson) who has a child with her Indian American husband (Mandvi) and her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) who has a kid with her lesbian partner (Cameron Esposito). Somehow the two siblings have managed to avoid sharing any news of their life choices with their distant ultra-conservative Texan parents (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) who are clearly in for well the mother of all surprises. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The ritual of squabbling and reconciliation that ensues may well be Marshalls attempt to reach across the political aisle though he lacks the finesse to distinguish between humor that mocks racist homophobic attitudes and humor that is itself mildly racist and homophobic. The lurching incoherence of ""Mothers Day"" is that it crudely solicits your amusement one minute then expects you to tear up at a series of shameless third-act twists involving a cemetery visit an asthma attack and an impromptu wedding. Have I said too much? Hardly. If youve seen any of these movies you know how this one ends -- not a minute too soon.------------Mothers DayMPAA rating PG-13 for language and some suggestive materialRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying In general releasejustin.changlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on April 29 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""A `Mothers Day thats OK to forget - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Movies Entertainment Reviews Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mothers-day-review-20160429-story.html,200,mother'sday13,mother'sday,latimes

Entertainment 6 Times Julia Robertss Wig Was Not The Most Cringeworthy Part Of ""Mothers Day"" Garry Marshalls latest holiday ensemble movie series reaches a low point; its a celebration of motherhood thats anything but. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston in Mothers Day. Ron Batzdorff / Open Road Films ID 8551222 1. Julia Roberts sits in an Atlanta cafe staring pensively out the window at a train going by. Shes playing Miranda Collins a HSN host who somehow is so famous that people shout out her name when they see her on TV and enter contests in order to have a picture taken with her.She is in Atlanta hawking a line of mood pendants for Mothers Day and -- because this is the latest star-stuffed Garry Marshall holiday pileup -- so she can cross paths with some of the ensembles other characters including Kristin (Britt Robertson) who she placed for adoption as a baby.Mirandas server comes by and like its a totally normal question to put to a total stranger sitting by herself asks if Mirandas a mom. Her eyes brim with regret over what might have been and this movie will have her suggest more than once that what shes about to say is a one-or-the-other proposition for women.No she says she has a career. View this image > Aniston. Open Road Films ID 8551817 2. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) a divorced interior designer and mother of two is running late to a job interview with Miranda. Shes so tardy that Mirandas already moved on to a meet and greet and security keeps blocking Sandys path. While others might accept that they fucked up not Sandy -- Sandy is Having A Day. In rom-com pratfall fashion shes ripped her blouse so that her bra is showing and she chooses to explode into a rant about how she was late because she had to take some time out for a meltdown over her ex (Timothy Olyphant) remarrying a twentysomething (Shay Mitchell) and because her moms car for some reason cant go very fast.Sandy who has crazy eyes and seems to forever be on her way to or from a workout literally declares to a room in this feature-length ode to the maternal experience that she cant be held to normal standards because shes a mother. Miranda that other half of the movies argument that motherhood and serious careers are incompatible is charmed and gives Sandy the gig telling her the qualities that lead her to rant about her personal life to a room full of randos are ones that she shouldnt lose because they get her attention. View this image > Sarah Chalke Kate Hudson and Margo Martindale. Ron Batzdorff / Open Road Films ID 8551233 3. Russell (Aasif Mandvi) is married to Jess (Kate Hudson) but hes staying with her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) because hes upset about having learned that all this time his wife has been lying about her parents. They dont have dementia as she claimed theyre actually racist homophobes whove driven up from Texas in their RV waving fried chicken and wearing patriotic T-shirts to surprise their children only to discover to their distress that Jess is married to an Indian man and Gabi is married to a woman (Cameron Esposito).Because this is meant to be a cuddly movie the way the parents (played merrily by Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) call Russell ""houseboy"" and ""towelhead"" is presented with shockingly little bite like its all just a bump in the road before the allure of grandchildren smooths things over. But the act that finally unites the clan is the moment when after some hijinks result in the cops being called Russell emerges from the RV to officers reacting like theyre going to tase or shoot him either due to the color of his skin or the womens robe hes borrowing. His in-laws come to his defense and its all laughed off because theres nothing like a lighthearted act of unprovoked and potentially deadly police violence to pull a family together.

Mirandas biological daughter Kristin has a daughter of her own with Zack (Jack Whitehall) a bartender and aspiring comedian shes been with for five years but refuses to marry. She cant do it she tells her friend Jesse (they met at Mommy and Me) because until she gets up the nerve to contact her biological mother to find out why she was placed for adoption she just doesnt feel like she knows who she is. Also she has to think about the impact that a possible future divorce might have on her kid though why she believes her child would have an easier time with her parents breaking up if they arent wed is unclear.Then as if she werent following in a stubborn movie tradition that draws a direct line between adoption and damage she declares with the ponderous solemnity only the most unnecessary lines deserve ""I have abandonment issues."" View this image > Jessi Case and Jason Sudeikis. Ron Batzdorff / Open Road Films ID 8551249 5. Jason Sudeikis is Bradley a widower and father of two whos still mourning his late wife (Jennifer Garner). He watches her old karaoke videos communes with her car and focuses the rest of his energies on coaching their older daughters (Jessi Case) soccer team and spying on her burgeoning relationship in a way of avoiding getting back out there himself.Hes positioned as a love interest for Sandy but in the name of being relatably frazzled she comes off as unbalanced and Sudeikiss performance is so disengaged that Sandys meet-cutes with Bradley leave him looking more like a man darting through hostile territory than one coming around to a new romance. Its hard to blame Bradley when immediately after their first encounter he witnesses Sandy having a steering wheel-pounding freakout in her car. (These qualities really do get her attention.) At the lowest ebb of this coupling he actually hides ducking behind the Lycra-clad form of a lady on a stair-climber when he spots her headed to yoga class at his gym like hes trying to reject his destiny entirely. View this image > Loni Love. Open Road Films ID 8552033 6. Kimberly (Loni Love) is unbelievably the only black character of any significance in Mothers Day despite the movie being set in Atlanta. Shes still minor there to provide commentary on Bradleys life and to serve as the sort of comic relief that gets assigned to the fuller bodied -- she for instance has trouble getting out of her lawn chair which is the kind of visual gag that comes across as meaner in a movie that makes a point of being overstuffed with lithe blondes in athleisure wear calling each other about pilates class.Kimberly is a fellow soccer parent of Bradley and is part of a chorus of women who want to set him up and who nag him about what his Mothers Day plans are. And without Bradleys permission she brings his daughters to their mothers grave on the day in question an act thats even more grossly inappropriate than needling a guy whose spouse is dead about how he and his daughters are going to mourn her while everyone else is out having brunch.Its one of the many moments in which Mothers Day which arrives in the wake of Marshalls Valentines Day and New Years Eve reveals itself to be not a movie celebration of motherhood but one that plucks at the anxieties surrounding it like stitches being undone. Its total clunkiness aside it never once manages to highlight a moment of triumph in its collection of characters who are all certain theyre doing things wrong -- whether due to fears of their children preferring their spritely new stepmom or because theyve carried on a years-long campaign of avoiding their mother or thanks to the way friends step in to take their children to the cemetery without asking them.No ones asking Mothers Day to be a masterpiece but it doesnt even manage the hokey ""aw"" thats the reason a movie like this exists. Its about parenting without a hint of pleasure save for the films insistence that opting out of it will leave you like Miranda sitting successful and alone wondering what if.

Maybe once every five or six screenings Ill make a quiet observation to a fellow critic seated next to me or Ill ask a question of a colleague. But even on those occasions I keep it quick and quiet. ""Mothers Day"" broke me down. I couldnt help myself. On at least a half-dozen occasions I was so dumbfounded by what was transpiring onscreen I blurted out an immediate reaction -- and at least twice I smacked the guy next to me on the shoulder. (Sorry Bill Stamets) A paraphrased recap of some of the comments I muttered under my breath (or at least I hope it was under my breath and not a full-out cry for help)  Im pretty sure not a single character in this Atlanta-set movie speaks with a Southern accent. Tax break anyone?  Did that old guy Texas redneck who wears patriotic clothing and has a chicken wing literally hanging out of his mouth when he drives his oversized motor home really call his daughters Indian husband a towel-head shortly after meeting him? For laughs? And when the rednecks wife sees a lesbian from behind she calls her a ""he""? What year is this?  Gee I really hope COORS LIGHT THE FOUR SEASONS FIJI BOTTLED WATER CADILLAC Mamp;Ms SKITTLES et al. are happy with the blatant product placement shots in this movie.  The owner of a bar called Shortys is a little person? Really?  Youre giving us the old ""character delivers a monologue with her back turned not realizing her intended audience has exited the room"" bit? Come on  By all means after an adult Caucasian is injured while performing a karaoke version of ""The Humpty Dance"" cut to the sassy black woman saying ""Thats what happens when white people try to rap"" and top it off with a shot of a black child dancing with impeccable rhythm. This movie never should have seen the light of day or the dark of theater. ""Mothers Day"" is Garry Marshalls third star-studded mawkish bloated holiday-themed film with intertwining characters and story lines. First there was the mediocre ""Valentines Day"" (2010). Then we were subjected to the sappy but relatively harmless ""New Years Eve"" (2011). But nothing could have prepared us for the offensively stupid shamelessly manipulative ridiculously predictable and hopelessly dated crapfest that is ""Mothers Day."" Nearly everyone in the talented and likable cast including a number of Garry Marshall regulars is to be commended for trying to lend some air of authenticity to the broadly sketched characters -- even if nobody succeeds. Jennifer Aniston plays Sandy a divorced mom of two boys who has hopes of getting back together with her rakishly handsome ex Henry (Timothy Olyphant) -- until Henry tells Sandy he recently got married to the twentysomething bombshell Tina (Shay Mitchell). Kate Hudsons Jesse is married to a doctor named Russell (Aasif Mandvi) and they have a toddler son but she hasnt told her parents Earl and Flo (Robert Pine and Margo Martindale) because theyre horrible racists who wouldnt approve. Oh and shes been lying to Russell all this time telling him her parents are in ill health and living in a retirement facility. Sarah Chalke plays Jesses lesbian sister who hasnt told her parents (you remember the lovable Earl and Flo) about HER marriage because theyre just as homophobic as they are racist. Hilarious Jason Sudeikis is a widower and father of two daughters who is still clinging to the memory of his wife a military hero (played by Jennifer Garner in the obligatory sad late-night video sequence.) And you better believe we get an over-the-top remembering-mom scene complete with an orchestral version of ""Taps."" Julia Roberts plays Miranda a career-driven TV hostess who peddles hideous jewelry and a self-help book. Britt Robertson is Kristin a young mother who cant fully commit to the father an aspiring stand-up comedian. As Kristin explains to Jesse she was adopted and she has always wondered about her birth mother. ""I have abandonment issues"" says Kristin. Thanks Kristin. We got that when you told us about being adopted and never hearing from your birth mother. From just about everything weve read and heard about Garry Marshall over the years hes a kind and nurturing fellow who always finds roles in his films for regulars such as Hector Elizondo Larry Miller and Sandra Taylor. (He also often finds room for himself his family members -- and relatives of cast members.) Thats nice. Marshall apparently also gets a kick out of Julia Roberts referencing ""Pretty Woman."" In a closing credits scene in ""Valentines Day"" a limo driver points out Rodeo Drive to Roberts character and asks if she ever shopped there. ""I did once"" she replies. ""It was a big mistake. Big. Huge."" This of course is a play on one of Vivians most famous lines in ""Pretty Woman"" when she gains her revenge on the snooty Rodeo Drive shop assistant who had turned away her business the day before. In ""Pretty Woman"" Elizondo played a hotel executive who takes a fatherly liking to ""Miss Vivian"" and teaches her about the proper use of silverware. ""I definitely have the salad fork"" says Vivian. ""The rest of the silverware is a little confusing."" In ""Mothers Day"" Roberts Miranda is having lunch when her manager Lance played by Elizondo interrupts to dispense some pearls of wisdom. Apropos of nothing Lance tells Miranda ""You definitely have the salad fork."" In what appears to be yet another distracting and annoying wink-wink touch Roberts Miranda sports a terrible and unflattering wig. According to People its literally the same wig worn by Roberts in ""Helix"" the movie within a movie in ""Notting Hill."" From Hitchcock to Spielberg to those rascals at Pixar filmmakers have often dropped inside references to their own previous films or movies they loved. Usually theres at least a touch of subtlety. Like just about everything else in ""Mothers Day"" the nod to the earlier movies are clumsy and pointless and obvious. Zero stars Open Road presents a film directed by Garry Marshall and written by Anya Kochoff Romano Matt Walker and Tom Hines. Running time 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for language and some suggestive material). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Credit Ron Batzdorff/Open Road Films The unofficial conclusion of an unofficial trilogy of holiday-themed multistar comedy vehicles directed by Garry Marshall ""Mothers Day"" has its perfunctory heart exactly where any experienced viewer would expect it to be. That is in a fantasy world where among other things one older mothers lifetime of bigotry can be cured by half an afternoon spent with a mixed-race child. Video Trailer Mothers Day ""Mothers Day"" is the latest star studded ensemble comedy from director Garry Marshall (""Pretty Woman"" ""Valentines Day""). Bringing together Jennifer Aniston Kate Hudson and Julia Roberts along with Jason Sudeikis its a celebration of mothers e By OPEN ROAD FILMS on Publish Date April 18 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed The major players in this movie of intertwined story lines include Kate Hudson as a daughter and mom addicted to secrets; Jennifer Aniston as a frazzled divorced mom superirritated by her ex played by Timothy Olyphant (whos clearly dying to star in a biopic of Billy Bob Thornton); Julia Roberts as a high-powered childless career woman; and Britt Robertson as a young single mom whos loath to marry her winsome British boyfriend because of her ambivalence about having been adopted. You will guess immediately who her mom turns out to be. Photo From left Sarah Chalke Kate Hudson and Margo Martindale. Credit Ron Batzdorff/Open Road Films The movie a goopy glossy mess with 10 times more respect for contrived sentimentality than for film grammar is bereft of genuinely amusing jokes -- Mr. Marshall really had some nerve naming his autobiography ""Wake Me When Its Funny."" Which is not to say the film lacks entertainment value. Theres unusual imagery in the form of Ms. Robertss recycled wig. (Perhaps she had hoped to pass for a Julia Roberts impersonator.) Theres suspense as when Jason Sudeikis playing a single dad sings ""The Humpty Dance"" for a roomful of children and you wonder if hell make it to the line ""I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom."" And there are laughs albeit inadvertent; the biggest comes courtesy of the productions no-doubt overworked sound department when Ms. Robertson utters ""I have abandonment issues"" without moving her mouth. GLENN KENNY""Mothers Day"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language of the sort that your mom may use with you if you take her to see this movie.

MOVIE REVIEW Mothers Day Running time 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language). The cinematic equivalent of a paper plate with macaroni and glitter haphazardly glued onto it ""Mothers Day"" is a film only its creators could love (and even they must be having some misgivings). Halfway through I began to suspect Julia Roberts chose that terrible wig from among her ""Pretty Woman"" artifacts as a wink at the camera about the things one does for money. Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Timothy Olyphant and Kate Hudson also turn up for the payday in this ode to a ""holiday"" normally celebrated at its most extravagant with breakfast in bed or a perfunctory phone call. As with his previous celebration-themed outings ""New Years Eve"" and ""Valentines Day"" director Garry Marshall -- who once gave us schmaltz with heart like the aforementioned Roberts classic plus ""Beaches"" and ""Frankie and Johnny"" -- grinds up a handful of so-what stories about wealthy mostly white people and puts them on shuffle. Theres Sandy (Aniston) raising two sons with ex-husband Henry (Olyphant oddly squinting through this role at Clint Eastwood levels) whose hot second wife (Shay Mitchell) sends Sandy into a tailspin of maternal competition. Sandys friend Jesse (Hudson) and her lesbian sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) are bemoaning their lack of connection to their bigoted mother (Margo Martindale) who cant handle Jesses being with an Indian man (Aasif Mandvi) and has no idea her other daughter is gay. Bradley (Sudeikis) is a widower raising two daughters with only the help of a Greek chorus of women at the gym he owns. And Kristin (Britt Robertson) and Zack (Jack Whitehall) are the young unmarried parents of a toddler; theyre trying to get his career as a stand-up comic off the ground and resolve her issues about being adopted. As Mothers Day approaches each of these vaguely linked characters grapples with its supposed significance. Meanwhile every so often up pops Miranda (Roberts) a Home Shopping Network guru hawking mood pendants. For some reason she is a gigantic celebrity. (In another shout-out to ""Pretty Woman"" she is also constantly shadowed by Hector Elizondo as her agent.) Breakdowns breakthroughs and platitudes ensue; in the worst bit Marshall tries to play off Martindales character and her husband (Robert Pine) as sort of adorably racist. They end up in an out-of-control RV barreling down the street trailed by a papier-mache vagina parade float which feels like a reasonably good metaphor for this stupid movie. ""I cant wait to see what they do for Fathers Day"" says an observer. God woman dont give Marshall any more ideas Hes also got Anistons character name-checking Flag Day so mark your calendars for at least a couple more of these. There is a time and a place for ""Mothers Day"" -- airplane channels and second-rate cable networks need material too. But listen There are many ways to honor your mom. Making her watch this tripe is not one of them.

By my count the top-billed female cast of Mothers Day includes one Oscar winner one Oscar nominee two Emmy winners a Tony nominee and a number of Golden Globes awardees. And yet theyre stuck in Mothers Day a piece of schlock from Garry Marshall who used to be a great romantic-comedy director but has favored these vignette-style movies based around Hallmark holidays - Valentines Day New Years Eve - as of late. Stars whom Marshall subjects to the vignette treatment this time around are old favorites from his past work - Julia Roberts Hector Elizondo and Kate Hudson - and newbies Jennifer Aniston Under the Domes Britt Robertson Jason Sudeikis and Margo Martindale. These movies have vaguely the same formula Pretty white people connected by a theme - guess this one - experience relatively minor problems that bring them into each others orbits. I could go through the mothering plots for each of the main characters played by Aniston Hudson Roberts Robertson and Sudeikis. (It wouldnt be Hollywood if a man couldnt shoehorn his way into a holiday dedicated to women.) But the story is convoluted and unengaging. The problem with this type of movie is ingrained in the structure Theres so much going on that theres no time to build characters that make sense or any sort of meaningful relationships. Its Aniston I feel the worst for here. Shes reduced to a harried divorcee who is supposed to be quirky and instead comes off as totally insane. The only thing that saves her character is Anistons natural charisma. The same could be said for Hudson and Roberts. These women are so incredibly watchable yet Mothers Day remains so entirely not. Its even sadder to think that these women - so talented so naturally effervescent on screen - arent starring in superhero movies or toplining dramas by themselves. (At least Roberts shares top billing with George Clooney next month in Money Monster). Ill watch Roberts be luminescent in something as terrible as Mothers Day if thats what is available but I wish she had more good things to do. meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909 Mothers Day Directed by Garry Marshall.

The man who once brought ""Love American Style"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"" to the small screen continues to operate with least-objectionable-programming in mind making another movie thats too innocuous to inspire actual rage yet too utterly tepid and bland to elicit a single laugh. See Video Jennifer Aniston Julia Roberts Kate Hudson Bring Gorgeous Mom Guilt to First Mothers Day Trailer This is the sort of brightly-lit work where everyone from interior designers to struggling waitresses owns spacious artfully cluttered homes with patios -- mean divorced dads live in modernist blocks that resemble bank branch locations -- and where suburbanites can fill their backyards with pricey party-store rentals at the drop of a hat. Throw in a Folgers Coffee can with the label turned to camera and ""Mothers Day"" would be a Hallmark Channel original movie. (Fret not though fans of product placement -- nearly every public space in this movie offers bottles of Fiji water and TVs tuned to the Home Shopping Network.) While screenwriters Anya Kochoff Romano (""Monster-in-Law"") Matt Walker and Tom Hines dial the action down from the cast of dozens featured in Marshalls previous assaults on the holidays there are still enough characters to ensure every single one will be a cursory outline of a human being. Also Read Jungle Book Set to Roar Past Keanu Mothers Day for 3rd Weekend Win Theres divorced mom Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) whose friendly relationship with ex-husband Henry (Timothy Olyphant) hits a bump when he gets remarried to the much-younger Tina (Shay Mitchell ""Pretty Little Liars""); widowed Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is unsure of how to cope with seeing his daughters through their first Mothers Day since the death of their mom (Jennifer Garner) in Afghanistan; would-be comedian Zack (Jack Whitehall) wants to marry girlfriend and mother of his child Kristin (Britt Robertson) but she has unresolved issues over being given up for adoption by her birth mother who turns out to be the staggeringly popular HSN host Miranda (Julia Roberts sporting one of the worst wigs in the history of cinema -- or the history of hair for that matter); and sisters and neighbors Jesse (Kate Hudson) and Gabi (Sarah Chalke) have to fess up about their relationships (Jesse is married to a person of color Gabi to a woman) when their racist homophobic mom Flo (Margo Martindale) pays them a visit. It is no spoiler to reveal that every possible complication or difficulty in this movie resolves itself in the most pat predictable and dully cheerful way possible with lessons learned and hugs distributed. Along the way we are assaulted by unfunny one-liners groan-inducing slapstick and a bevy of famous faces either phoning it in or being placed in outright embarrassing situations. Seeing the great Martindale grapple with material this weak is like witnessing a tagger being unleashed onto Mount Rushmore and certainly someone with the comic chops and timing of Loni Love deserves better than to be subjected to pole-dancing jokes. See Photos Jennifer Aniston Julia Roberts Celebrate Early at Mothers Day Hollywood Premiere The film constantly reveals itself as having no idea how human beings speak or behave whether its the completely contrived hi-jinks involving Jesse and Gabi trying to keep their secrets Zacks painfully inane stand-up or the sad little cardboard diorama that supposedly successful designer Sandy brings with her on a go-see. (""Mothers Day"" seems clueless about what it is that computers actually do apart from Skype.) There was a moment early in his film career when movies like ""The Flamingo Kid"" and the underrated ""Nothing in Common"" suggested that Marshall might leave the banality of sitcoms behind and mature into a competent comedic director but his recent output has all the zest of room-temperature oatmeal. Women everywhere deserve equal pay maternity leave unrestricted access to family planning and far better movies about motherhood than ""Mothers Day.""

Kudos to Marshall for finding one more sellable gimmick in the latter end of a great comedy career - his trilogy of starry holiday-themed anthology romances New Years Eve Valentines Day and this. None of them were award-winners but they were pleasant enough. Mothers Day however seems bloodless as if all thats left is the formula and a whole lot of robotically-delivered lines in thankless roles. Moreover it seems stuck in the 80s on multiple counts including the soundtrack and the sensibility. Put it this way one of the key plots revolves around Kate Hudson and her sister (Sarah Chalke) who conspire to hide their respective spouses/plot-devices from their mother (the wonderful-but-lost Margo Martindale). Why? Because they are married to an Indian-American doctor (Aasif Mandvi) and a woman (Cameron Esposito). Believe it or not this is a movie made in 2016. What else have we got? Well Jennifer Aniston is Sandy a divorced mom whos losing her mind because her ex (Timothy Olyphant) is marrying a young twentysomething (Shay Mitchell). She also loses her mind whenever shes in the vicinity of a charming widowed fitness instructor named Bradley (Jason Sudeikis). Never has there been a movie where two people ""meet cute"" so often and so unconvincingly. And then theres Julia Roberts as Miranda a writer and TV personality whose only child Kristen (Britt Robertson) was given up for adoption at birth. Kristen is about to get married but the burden on her subconscious of having been ""given away"" makes her question her suitability for marriage and motherhood. Marshall may have decided that the busy-ness of New Years Eve and Valentines Day was what made them a success. To that end Mothers Day is practically a sardine-can of plots but has few fleshed-out characters (Sudeikis comes closest to believability). The occasional gag is good for a schticky chuckle (a little boy puts on a costume backwards at a pageant placing his tail at groin level... that sort of thing). But otherwise Mothers Day seems more like a contractual commitment than a creative exercise.

TWITTER 4/29/2016 Garry Marshalls latest holiday-pegged ensemble comedy stars Jennifer Aniston Julia Roberts Kate Hudson and Jason Sudeikis. Even if you havent seen Garry Marshalls last two holiday-pegged efforts -- Valentines Day and New Years Eve with their generous smattering of stars sub-sitcom one-liners and shameless heartstring yanking -- it wont take long to figure out what kind of movie Mothers Day is. The signs are there in the first few minutes perky pop song over the opening credits hokey voiceover people rushing through morning routines (no one is ever on time in these comedies) ill-advised dialogue (when a woman chides her young son for not wearing underwear he replies exasperated ""Its called free balling Mom""). Mothers Day is bad from the start and it doesnt get better. Part of the problem is structural. Valentines Day and New Years Eve came equipped with teeming big-name casts spread out across various vignettes; hacky and dimwitted as the films were they never stranded you with anyone for too long (not into Katherine Heigl as a lovelorn caterer? Heres Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele stuck in an elevator). Mothers Day features far fewer characters and subplots stretched thin over a punishingly protracted 118 minutes; theres no buffer between you and the movies ineptitude. Jennifer Aniston plays Sandy a harried Atlanta divorcee and mother of two whose ex (Timothy Olyphant) suddenly elopes with a young bombshell (Shay Mitchell). Sandys BFF Jesse (Kate Hudson) is raising a son with husband Russell (Aasif Mandvi) but hasnt yet informed her conservative Texan parents Flo and Earl (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) because well Russell is of Indian origin and Flo and Earl are racist rednecks. Jesses sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) meanwhile has told Mom and Dad she has a fiance named Steve when in reality she has a wife named Max (Flo and Earl are homophobic too). Jason Sudeikis is Bradley a widower whose wife a marine was killed in combat (we see her briefly played by Jennifer Garner in an old video). Their kids Rachel (Jessi Case) and Vicky (Ella Anderson who seemed to have more fun as Kristen Bells daughter in The Boss) try their best to tolerate Bradleys overzealous soccer coaching and cluelessness about menstruation. Julia Roberts (still loyal to her Pretty Woman director after all these years) plays Miranda a home shopping network mogul who despite her supposed millions sports a conspicuously cheap-looking wig. Miranda has a secret that involves Kristin (rising star Britt Robertson bland) a young mom whos not sure she wants to marry the father of her baby an ostensibly talented aspiring British comic named Zack (Jack Whitehall). Given the dire stand-up routine Zack performs in one scene you can hardly blame Kristin for having cold feet. As you can guess these different narrative strands will converge on the titular holiday. Along the way theres a meet-cute a re-meet-cute a wedding a medical crisis a runaway RV a few reconciliations several breakthroughs and a climactic selfie. Hector Elizondo shows up as he always does in Marshalls films for an in-joke with Roberts that may make hardcore Pretty Woman fans smile but is an ominous sign for any self-respecting screenplay. And boy oh boy that screenplay. Written by Anya Kochoff Romano Matt Walker and Tom Hines (the last two of whom are frequent Marshall collaborators) the dialogue in Mothers Day is so colorless its like white noise. (Why it seems so hard for mainstream big-screen comedy writers to pen even minimally amusing things for actors to say is a mystery given the wealth of wit on TV from HBOs Veep and Girls to Netflixs Master of None and Love and beyond. Turn on the tube folks) The biggest laugh in Mothers Day comes when Sandys son mistakenly wears his lion costume backwards in a school play the tail protruding obscenely from his crotch. Thats as good as it gets though the movie picks up momentarily when Flo and Earl pay their daughters a surprise visit and find themselves face to face with the Indian and lesbian significant others they didnt know existed (""Are you the house boy?"" Earl asks Russell when he first happens upon him in the kitchen). But the filmmakers failure to think their comic situations through let alone locate any unexpected notes in them defeats the movie at every turn Not for a moment do you believe willowy patrician Jesse and Gabi (Hudson and Chalke) were raised by such brazen yokels and the bit that has them trying to pass off Gabis wife Max (Cameron Esposito) as her ""business partner"" is so 20 years ago it borders on offensive. John Debneys twinkly score and Marshalls flat barely-there direction are about what you expect them to be -- and frankly no one goes to see Mothers Day for the innovative camerawork. The quartet of stars is the main attraction though theyre not playing people as much as broad variations on their own screen (and off-screen) personas Aniston is warm self-deprecating and a little bit sad; Roberts is imperious but with a heart of gold; Hudson is a bohemian-yuppie princess; Sudeikis is dorky-cool a smart-ass with a soft center. Predictably Martindale that miracle of an actress has sharper timing and more presence than any of her co-stars. Over the years Marshall has proven to be an unapologetic peddler of wish-fulfillment fantasies which he often packages in slick schmaltzy stories of women being civilized or corrected (Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries most famously). But hes capable of good things the tart fizzy first half of Overboard for example and much of Frankie and Johnny still his most mature winning movie. Even some of his glaring misfires had spark and integrity (like Georgia Rule with its stormy charismatic Lindsay Lohan performance and strange brew of slapstick and serious themes). Whats most dispiriting about Mothers Day is how little life there is in it how difficult the film is to connect to despite the inherent relatability of the material. Its a movie not even a mother could love.

Like the glowing briefcase in ""Pulp Fiction"" or the final whispered words of ""Lost in Translation"" the ill-fitting Anna Wintour wig worn by Julia Roberts in ""Mothers Day"" seems destined to enter the pantheon of great cinematic mysteries. Did some earlier version of the script explain the wigs presence? Why does no character in the film point out how strange it looks? Did Roberts insist on wearing the wig -- a leftover prop from one of her faux films in ""Notting Hill"" -- as a Brando-esque bit of actorly mischief or does it hold deeper significance? We may never know the answers to these questions but pondering them provides some welcome distraction while slogging through director Garry Marshalls third minor-holiday ensemble comedy which somehow makes one long for the Hallmark-card half-competence of predecessors ""Valentines Day"" and ""New Years Eve."" Atrociously written begrudgingly acted haphazardly assembled and never more backward than when it thinks its being progressive ""Mothers Day"" should at least be able to count on Mothers Day traffic to boost its box office -- or at least it could have were it not opening 10 days prior. From the release date to the costuming to the heavy-handed Sprouts supermarket product placement almost nothing about ""Mothers Day"" makes much sense. Its true that no one ever sets out to make a bad film but in certain extreme cases -- the latter-day works of Adam Sandler for example -- the creeping suspicion that so few people involved in making the film actually cared whether it was any good can be equally demoralizing. Thats certainly the case here. After a brief voiceover from a never-seen character (Penny Marshall) about the daily struggles of motherhood were introduced to an unwieldy cast of upper-class moms in the Atlanta area all of whom share some roughly sketched troubles that come to a head in the week before Mothers Day. The only one who really scans as a harried matriarch is Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) a stressed single-mother of two whose squinty ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) has just announced his marriage to an airheaded twentysomething (Shay Mitchell). Sandy commiserates with her constantly-exercising friend Jesse (Kate Hudson) who lives next door to her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke). Both siblings have been keeping their children and spouses secret from their bigoted Texas parents -- Jesses husband Russell (Aasif Mandvi) is Indian while Gabi is married to a woman (Cameron Esposito). Further off in the films orbit Jason Sudeikis takes a straight-man role as Bradley a physical trainer facing his first Mothers Day without his dead wife (Jennifer Garner glimpsed in home movies singing karaoke at a military base) and befuddled by his oldest daughters sudden interest in boys and tampons. Elsewhere Kristin (Britt Robertson) cares for her newborn while tending bar rejecting the marriage proposals from the babys standup comic father (Jack Whitehall) on account of some childhood parental abandonment issues. On the conspicuously childless side of the coin -- ""Do you have any kids?"" ""No. Career"" goes a representative exchange -- Roberts and her wig play a cheap-jewelry-hawking Home Shopping Network host roughly as famous in the Atlanta area as Johnny Carson and Oprah combined. Given the length of time required to simply introduce the cast one can forgive Marshall and his team of screenwriters for falling back on easy well-worn conflicts once the narrative wheels finally get moving. Most end predictably -- a wedding a reconciliation a moment of clarity a Digital Underground karaoke session -- but a few go careening off the rails. Most unwatchable is the plot strand involving Jesse and Gabis hayseed parents who pay their daughters a surprise visit. Riding around in an RV clad head-to-toe in Stars and Stripes and using chicken wings as toothpicks the two are such ghastly caricatures that the portrayal almost seems unfair toward racist homophobes. Luckily theyre cured of their bone-deep bigotry thanks to an accidental Skype session with Russells broadly-played Indian mum (Anoush NaVart) who reveals that she too was once as prejudiced as they. Finally a movie that makes ""Crash"" look like ""Do the Right Thing."" On that note when a film is split between a half-dozen protagonists and set in a city that is 51% black it really doesnt seem unreasonable to wonder why it couldnt make room for a woman of color or two among the major characters. (Then again with roles like these maybe its for the best.) Stranger still is the prevalence of the male gaze in a film about motherhood. No one breastfeeds in ""Mothers Day"" but the camera seems to be angled directly down Anistons cleavage in most of her scenes and one strange sequence sees Hudson spill a glass of water on her shirt just so she can strip down to her bra while changing it. One keeps expecting the mishap to set up some kind of joke but none arrives -- who exactly is this film for? Save for a few minor ADR issues the films craftsmanship is fine and production designer Missy Stewart floods the sets with so much floral greenery that the whole movie might as well take place inside a Mothers Day bouquet. Its hard to fault the cast given the scraps theyre forced to feed on but only Aniston manages to inject any real life into her performance. She even has the films best line Aghast at her ex-husbands suggestion that their kids spend Mothers Day with their new stepmom she shoots back ""You can have Flag Day"" One just hopes that isnt Marshalls idea of a sequel.

Evelyn Danielle says May 9 2016 at 157 am Went to see this film on Mothers Day. There were a total of 11 people in the theater. I made the ghastly sin of not reading reviews before choosing this film. Never again It was really really bad - terrible - waste of time - waste of money - waste of talent. Its hard to believe that so many stars attached their name to this train wreck. Julia Roberts looked horrendous in an orange-colored wig and hot pink mini dress. I actually cringed. I really wish someone would give Jennifer Aniston a decent role. I think she is a good actress but hasnt been given a proper chance since Friends. Reply Bill B. says April 29 2016 at 901 am Sounds just terrible. How does Aniston keep getting roles. Most of her film career has been in flop bad films. Reply Cindylover1969 says April 28 2016 at 1133 pm ""Stranger still is the prevalence of the male gaze in a film about motherhood."" Perhaps it s mashup of the movie want to put something in there for any hetero males whos partners drag the to the movie (see also the presence of some fansarvicy cast members as Kate Hudson Shay Mitchell and Jennifer aniston). Reply Marie says April 28 2016 at 644 pm Just by the trailer itself you knew this movie was going to suck. Strange Julia Roberts used to be the it girl back in the day but now a lot of films to she stars in now barely make any dough. Reply citney (citney5) says April 28 2016 at 439 pm This film is at 9% on RT. Yet another flop for Aniston I thought she was taking her ""career"" in a different direction. It seems it is still headed down down down. Reply Rogers Hartmann says April 28 2016 at 353 pm Ouch. Reply Sexracist says April 28 2016 at 1258 pm When you have nothing to say as a writer you can always fall back on racial and sexist arguments to fill up space just like Barker.

(  / Open Road Films) Despite an army of appealing actors in its large ensemble cast the rom-com ""Mothers Day"" is startlingly unappealing. Clumsily edited and culturally tone deaf its more obsessed with the titular holiday than even most mothers would find reasonable. Whenever presented with two storytelling options -- between say subtlety and obviousness -- the movie runs swiftly and consistently away from nuance and toward predictability. Among other sins ""Mothers Day"" features a character with abandonment issues who announces ""I have abandonment issues."" Then theres the running gag about a Mothers Day parade float shaped like a uterus. (Nothing says comedy like a womb on wheels.) At one point Jennifer Garner sings a Huey Lewis and the News song in what feels like the whitest moment in the history of cinema. That is until roughly 45 minutes later when Jason Sudeikis does a karaoke version of ""The Humpty Dance"" while wearing salmon-colored pants. This thing is a mess. Though not technically part of a franchise ""Mothers Day"" feels like it is. Thats because director Garry Marshalls two most recent films -- ""Valentines Day"" and ""New Years Eve"" -- also center on holidays. Like them ""Mothers Day"" jams too many characters and too many story lines into a single movie relying on jokes that were stale sitcom fodder two decades ago. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. ""Mothers Day"" frantically hopscotches between multiple narratives. Jennifer Aniston is a mom who has nervous breakdowns in grocery store parking lots after her ex-husband (Timothy Olyphant) marries a younger woman. Sudeikis is a former Marine trying to be strong for his two daughters after losing his wife (Garner). An aspiring comic (Jack Whitehall) wants to marry his girlfriend/baby-mama (Britt Robertson) but cant because she fears commitment. Julia Roberts is a successful businesswoman and author whose career obsessiveness masks a long-held secret. And Kate Hudsons Jesse -- happily married with a child -- has hidden that information from her racist parents because her husband (Aasif Mandvi) is Indian. That last plot thread is easily the films biggest misstep. Its hard to say whats most offensive about it. Is it the fact that Jesses mother -- Margo Martindale in a role several sedimentary layers beneath her talents -- refers to the husband as a ""towelhead""? Or maybe that as racist white people Jesses parents are naturally from Texas where they live in a trailer park? Five people including Marshall have story and/or screenwriting credits on ""Mothers Day."" But the way this film is written its hard to believe that any of them have ever visited a trailer park or spent time with an Indian American. Im not sure theyve ever observed actual humans. Despite the many obstacles in their way the cast members throw themselves gamely into the material. Occasionally they even shine in spite of it. Whitehall for instance is charming in a scene that forces him to take the stage at a comedy club with his baby daughter in his arms. As for Roberts she turns on the tears -- and that high-wattage smile -- in a way that never lets you forget shes a movie star darn it. (Even if she is forced to wear a wig thats the hair equivalent of mom jeans.) But even she cant save ""Mothers Day"" from itself. When Anistons character casually mentions Groundhog Day and Flag Day in conversation I immediately thought to myself ""Be quiet you or Garry Marshall will get even more bad ideas."" PG-13.

The answer it turns out was ""nothing."" We are but simple peons powerless to stop the completion of the ""Pretty Woman"" directors holiday-themed trilogy of terror. Lifeless ugly and vaguely evil in its gross attempt to offer something for everyone ""Mothers Day"" doesnt feel like a movie so much as it does a cinematic adaptation of Walmart. ""Ahh Mothers Day"" sighs the opening narration as if the film itself is resigned to the pain its about to cause. Set in an alternate-reality Atlanta where theres only one black person (and shes pretty much just part of the chorus) Marshalls latest has all the makings of a dystopian horror movie. Unlike in the previous films the action here isnt restricted to the titular holiday -- the story begins nearly a week before the BIG DAY and everybody is so anxiously preoccupied with the festivities that its hard to tell if theyre preparing for Mothers Day or the Purge. You know the drill An enormous collection of dull characters most of whom know each other through tenuous friendships or casual encounters find love and acceptance in the shadow of a holiday that brings people together. For better or worse ""Mothers Day"" is a more narrowly focused film than its predecessors. Instead of splitting up two hours of screen time between 812 different story lines this one divvies up the brunt of its duration between four major characters and sprinkles the rest of its ensemble cast on top whenever it needs some sugar. It might stand to reason that reserving more attention for each character would allow for greater depth and nuance but nothing in this movie adheres to reason. On the contrary the less fragmented structure just gives us more time to wallow in the remarkable shallowness of each absurdly facile plot and wander way too far ahead of where theyre going. These are not characters that can sustain 20 minutes of screen-time -- these  are characters that can barely sustain their quadrant of the poster. Jennifer Aniston plays Sandy a Jennifer Aniston type whos a happily divorced (and deeply delusional) mother of two. When her roguish ex-husband Henry (Timothy Olyphant) tells her that he wants to talk to her about something important Sandy assumes that he must want to get back together. Silly Sandy. The opening credits have barely finished girl -- hes obviously just going to tell you about his jailbait new wife (""Pretty Little Liars"" alum Shay Mitchell). Meanwhile in another pocket of suburbia Jesse (Kate Hudson) hasnt spoken to her hyper-conservative mother (Margo Martindale) in years because shes afraid to tell her that she married an Indian guy (Aasif Mandvi). Other than ""wanting to go Indian"" Jesses other characteristics include doing yoga on her lawn and wearing unbuttoned striped shirts. Actually thats all of her characteristics -- she has two and thats both of them. She does however have a sister named Gabi (Sarah Chalke) a recently married lesbian whos scared to come out to her mother for the same reasons that Jesse has stopped talking to her altogether. Downtown Miranda (Julia Roberts) is a hyper-successful Joy Mangano type whos hocking her chintzy jewelry on the local equivalent of QVC. Roberts performance has a real ""We all know that I owe Garry Marshall my star-making role"" quality to it. Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is the last of the major characters. The bearded father of two young girls Bradley is staring down his familys first Mothers Day since his military wife (Jennifer Garner) was killed in action. Hes not quite ready to start dating again but after meeting Sandy in a supermarket checkout line and having an awkwardly hostile conversation about tampons its pretty clear that theyre destined to be together forever. And even though ""Mothers Day"" goes relatively light on the subplots one essential thread gets snagged in the awkward limbo between lead and supporting stories. Its a doozy Kristin (""Tomorrowland"" star Britt Robertson) is a bartender whos skittish about marrying her co-worker and baby daddy boyfriend Zack (Jack Whitehall). Hes a standup comedian whose material could be generously described as less amusing than most hate crimes. Of course thats not why Kristin has cold feet -- the actual reason is far less rational. If you think that all of these stories wont all somehow come to a head on the second Sunday in May then you havent been paying attention -- Judgment Day is nigh. How they each arrive at that final destination makes for a very special journey as the plotting here is at once both agonizingly predictable and profoundly demented a rare combination that results from the unique chemistry between the films four credited writers (only one of whom -- ""Monster-in-Law"" scribe Anya Kochoff has ever had their name on another produced script). There isnt a single line in this movie that sounds as if it was written by a human but far too few flow with the inbred poetry of ""The Room"" or ""Birdemic"" (the dialogue cleaves closer to the ""Navajo English"" of Godards ""Film Socialisme""). The movies most natural reaction shot belongs to a llama. In fairness however the handful of moments that do transcend into howlingly bad territory are all-timers topped off by a scene in which Sandy vents  to one of the clowns shes hired for her sons birthday party. ""Mothers Day"" is the rare comedy in which the funniest moments are all unintentional and hearing Jennifer Aniston sincerely compare a clowns bottomless hanky to ""the bottomless love of a mother for her child"" results in the kind of laughter that cant be engineered. Several members of the cast seem to recognize that theyre in a hurricane of garbage but Margo Martindale and Robert Pine -- playing Jesse and Gabis redneck parents -- are the only actors who are interested in having fun with that fact. Trump supporters in everything but name these yokels have driven their RV straight out of the first draft of an Alexander Payne screenplay and Pine plays his role with all the subtlety of a Republican primary debate. By the time the movie ends with Earl behind the wheel of an out-of-control RV as its being chased by a massive papier mache vagina the allusions to this years Republican primaries almost make themselves. The movie has absolutely nothing to say about the challenges or rewards of being having or missing a mother. Marshall is 81 and by all accounts a very nice man. If nothing else its clear that everyone on the set of ""Mothers Day"" was enjoying their time working with him -- for proof look no further than hilarious bloopers in which Jennifer Aniston is seen ruining a take by accidentally referring to Julia Roberts character as ""Julia"" Julia But thats her real name What a gas.

Ahhh Mothers Day Reply Mar April 30 2016 830 pm Wow dont hold back. You review is full of bitterness and resentment. Now I will go see the movie and judge for my self. This review is a little juvenile Reply Bev May 1 2016 956 pm Watch if for just Britt Robertson Reply steve May 2 2016 110 pm Someone else saw BIRDEMIC? Cool one of the best bad movies ever made. Reply Sug May 7 2016 827 pm This review reads like a personal vendetta. What happened? Garry Marshall refuse to hire you for something?

VPCJulia Roberts Jason Sudeikis and Sarah Chalke also feature in a comedy that eventually runs out of gas.Widower Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) and daughter Rachel (Jessi Case) prepare for ""Mothers Day.""(Photo Ron Batzdorff)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 out of 5 starsIn ""Mothers Day"" Garry Marshall returns to the world of starry ensemble casts and interlocking stories. Now anyone who suffered through the dismal ""Valentines Day"" and the even-worse ""New Years Eve"" does not view this as good news. Quite the opposite.Perhaps because the bar was set so low ""Mothers Day"" turns out to be surprisingly watchable. Sure youll forget all about it a week after youve seen it but its mostly pleasant and occasionally touching even though its a lot closer to an episode of ""The Love Boat"" than ""Love Actually.""Ex-wife meets new wife of ex-husband with kids in tow. Thats whats going on in ""Mothers Day"" featuring (from left) Caleb Brown Jennifer Aniston Brandon Spink Shay Mitchell and Timothy Olyphant. (Photo Ron Batzdorff )The filmmakers smartest move was putting Jennifer Aniston at the center of the action. She plays Sandy a divorced mom of two boys with various plots and characters orbiting around her. Maybe its because she got her start in sitcoms but Aniston knows how to add some emotional heft to lightweight material. Sandys sons ask her what they should call their dads new wife. ""Maam is nice"" she offers and Aniston makes the line believable and funny. Thats a gift.RELATED Back from cancer Garry Marshall celebrates Mothers DaySandy is fighting jealous feelings about her ex-husbands much younger new spouse (Shay Mitchell) who has grown close to her sons. Sandy is pals with Jesse (Kate Hudson) who has been estranged from her parents who now show up for Mothers Day. Sandy wants to return to work and shes trying to land a job with Miranda (Julia Roberts) a wildly successful entrepreneur who plugs her goods on a home-shopping channel. Miranda also gave up her daughter for adoption years ago and guess who shows up at her latest book signing?Miranda (Julia Roberts left) interviews Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) for a job in ""Mothers Day."" (Photo Ron Batzdorff)Easily the most engaging part of the movie is Sandys awkward flirtation with a widower (Jason Sudeikis) with two daughters. They have a fun chemistry and you want to see them wind up together. Most of the actors are appealing particularly British comedian Jack Whitehall (playing a comic naturally) and Sarah Chalke cast as Jesses sister who has kept her sexuality a secret from Mom.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestUnfortunately Marshall starts to lose control of the movie as it nears the end. It grows both slapsticky (Sudeikis falls off a balcony) and stupid (one sequence involves a speeding RV with faulty brakes) and the goodwill that has been built up gradually dissipates. Still for a fair amount of the time ""Mothers Day"" actually does what it sets out to do. It just cant sustain it for its entire running time.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

EntertainmentMovies Mothers Day Do your mom a favor and skip this comedy Originally published April 28 2016 at 1200 am Updated April 28 2016 at 302 pm ""Mothers Day"" includes Jennifer Aniston left and Kate Hudson as two not-very-interesting moms. (Ron Batzdorff) Movie review of ""Mothers Day"" The latest in a series of holiday-inspired movies by Garry Marshall this compilation of stories features many mothers none of them interesting. Rating 1.5 stars out of four. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Motherhood let no one disagree is hard work. Then again so is sitting through Garry Marshalls new comedy ""Mothers Day"" a two-hour movie so forgettable that Im not convinced it actually exists. Ready for Mothers Day? Share your moms best advice The latest film in Marshalls grimly formulaic holiday series (""New Years Eve"" ""Valentines Day"") ""Mothers Day"" is according to my notes an assortment of stories involving mothers. Theres a divorced mom (Jennifer Aniston) trying to adjust to her ex-husbands new marriage and her sons new bombshell stepmom. (Bombshell = wears shorts and thigh-high boots around the house as one does.) Theres a new mom (Britt Robertson) a widowed dad (Jason Sudeikis) a gay mom (Sarah Chalke) a nasty racist homophobic mom (Margo Martindale) and a mom (Kate Hudson) who mostly just seems to work out a lot. And theres a Home Shopping Network guru career-woman (Julia Roberts) who says from beneath her hideous red-mushroom wig that shes Not A Mom Thank You Very Much but youll see her plotline coming like a storm cloud on the horizon. All this is set in Atlanta where there is apparently exactly one grocery store one soccer field one gym and one hospital and where all these characters intersect. Everything sorts itself out exactly as you think it might with warm Mothers Day wishes for all. And not one of these people or stories is remotely interesting; all seem to have been written by committee. Only Anistons character seems to have an actual personality (shes funny when she talks to herself in explosive little rants) and for that I think we can credit the performance over the script. Movie Review 1/2   Mothers Day with Jennifer Aniston Kate Hudson Julia Roberts Jason Sudeikis Britt Robertson Timothy Olyphant Hector Elizondo Jack Whitehall Margo Martindale. Directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by Anya Kochoff Romano Matt Walker and Tom Hines. 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and some suggestion material. Several theaters. Its a lazy movie that fades from memory the instant the credits start to roll; a blandly pretty cog in a studio wheel. Moms deserve better. So do moviegoers.

Moms the word in a comedy with more stars than good jokes. Director Garry Marshall. (158). PG-13 Strong language. Area theaters. Whats worse than a Mothers Day brunch full of flat champagne reheated leftovers and two hours spent staring at the ceiling? A ""Mothers Day"" movie full of flat jokes reheated cliches and two hours spent staring at your watch. Garry Marshalls latest attempt to turn a Hallmark card worth of material into a holiday film features Julia Roberts Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson as maternal figures facing all sorts of questions. JENNIFER ANISTON HAD JITTERS WORKING WITH JULIA ROBERTS Chief among them How did my agent get me stuck in this thing? Following the lazy formula the director laid down in ""Valentines Day"" and ""New Years Eve"" Marshall and his writers line up a bunch of stars set up some basic sitcom situations then hope audiences are in the right holiday spirit. Kate Hudsons Jesse has never told her bigoted parents shes married to an Indian. Jennifer Anistons Sandy suddenly has to deal with a remarried ex and a sexy stepmom. Julia Robertss Miranda -- well its not immediately clear what Mirandas problem is. Julia Roberts off-screen problem however is she made ""Pretty Woman"" for Marshall and clearly thinks she owes him. Julia Roberts (l.) and Jennifer Aniston (r.) star together in ""Mothers Day."" (Ron Batzdorff/Open Road Films) And this film -- her fourth for him -- pays the debt in full with interest. At least the Oscar-winner only has to look superior while wearing an ugly red pageboy wig. Hudson however is stuck with jokes about her supposedly cute racist parents -- who pop in for a surprise visit. Aniston a trooper typically works the hardest while making the strained setup feel the most natural. And there are a couple of other stories including one with Jason Sudeikis as a sadsack widower although they dont result in much. In fact most of the gags fall flat and the films big centerpiece -- a runaway RV with comical cops in pursuit -- is painfully bad. True Marshalls movies often feel like an old ""Laverne and Shirley"" episode. But this feels like something Laverne and Shirley wrote. Or maybe Lenny and Squiggy. The plotting is laughably predictable. The supporting players are dreadful. The impatient cutting among the different stories only makes everything feel less like a movie than a night on the couch channel surfing trying hard to find something worth watching. Well there is. Its just in another theater. Take your mom to see ""The Meddler"" instead.
