The scenerys grand and wide-open the motivations primal and the bad guys wear black hats (well mostly anyway) in this first of the seasons big Westerns. And theres a climactic shootout youll be glad to know that justifies all the sitting around the characters do while they wait for that titular train. Russell Crowes the bad guy a ruthless killer who sketches birds and pretty girls when he and his gang arent slaughtering innocents and robbing stagecoaches equipped with crankable machine guns. Christian Bale is the troubled but principled rancher who for a variety of painstakingly established reasons will escort Crowe to the prison cell on the first car of the Yuma-bound 310 train come hell or high noon. Nothing terribly original happens in this remake of a 1957 semi-classic that starred Glenn Ford and Van Heflin but everything happens smoothly and with grace. Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) makes the emotions count and keeps the action fluid. And hes had the wit to allow Ben Foster (who was an arty wimp on Six Feet Under and sprouted an angels wings in the latest X-Men extravaganza) to steal every scene he walks into -- as the most implacably murderous of Crowes henchmen.

"Review 310 to Yuma a classic ride - CNN.com Review 310 to Yuma a classic rideStory Highlights Reviewer Tom Charity ""310 to Yuma"" a Western in classic mode Russell Crowe plays bad guy escorted by good-guy rancher Christian Bale But characters are complex movie brings out shadingsNext Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- For a good part of the last century and certainly throughout Hollywoods golden age the Western was a staple in any boys imaginative diet. The lore was so deeply engrained it seemed to stand for America itself. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are on opposite sides in ""310 to Yuma."" Then for any number of reasons we grew out of that mythology. The movies by and large gave up on the genre; save for occasional brave forays by Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner its been a box office non-starter since the 1970s. It will be interesting to see if the drawing power of Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt (in the forthcoming ""Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") can buck that trend. Director James Mangolds expert and entertaining ""310 to Yuma"" demonstrates both the Westerns age-old appeal and the problems it presents to a contemporary filmmaker. Tellingly it begins with the image of a sickly tubercular child rasping for breath in the night and then the flare of a light as his older brother reaches for a dime-store paperback a well-thumbed cowboy yarn he means to read before sleep. These two boys dont know it but they will influence everything their father does over the next two days. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is an honest rancher -- which is to say poor. Hes crippled by debt and crippled physically too a souvenir from the War Between the States. Offered 200 to escort the outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) safely into custody on the 310 train with a makeshift posse comprising a veterinarian (Alan Tudyk) a wounded Pinkerton operative (Peter Fonda) and a businessman (Dallas Roberts) Dan does it for the money for respect and because he believes its the right thing to do. Over the course of the journey the articulate genial Wade whittles away at each of these convictions even as he looks for any opportunity to level off the odds. Adapted from an early short story by Elmore Leonard that was previously filmed very capably in 1957 with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin ""310 to Yuma"" strikes a fair balance between physical action and psychological warfare but always at its core is the question of how we are to measure these two men. Crowe plays Wade very gently. Hes a man utterly at ease with himself commanding and confident no matter that he spends much of the picture in chains. Crowes performance makes him all the more attractive. Its also clear that hes utterly ruthless. Crowe demonstrates that too. By contrast Christian Bales Evans is still striving to prove something. He may occupy the moral high ground but most often hes the one picking himself out of the dust. Its not just that the Devil has all the best tunes hes more of a real man too. Mangold has made this film before -- or one very much like it. The police thriller ""Copland"" was really an urban Western with Sylvester Stallone as the honest inadequate small-town sheriff and Harvey Keitel as the corrupt capable NYPD detective. ""310 to Yuma"" is a much better movie. The story is more muscular and direct and the shading is more artful. Even so Mangold has a job creating a satisfying redemptive resolution. If the ending works its on the basis that these two very different men recognize and respond to an unlikely kinship the shame of a father the pain of a son. Is that enough to redeem a killer? I didnt believe it but I wanted to. I suspect James Mangold would say the same. ""310 to Yuma"" is rated R and runs 120 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"310 to Yuma Chugs Along Familiar Tracks washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies 310 to Yuma Chugs Along Familiar Tracks From left Alan Tudyk Christian Bale Russell Crowe Peter Fonda and Glen Hollander in the western ""310 to Yuma"" a remake that doesnt match the 1957 original. (By Richard Foreman -- Lionsgate Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 7 2007 One hopes (I do anyway) that ""310 to Yuma"" is a big hit. That means there will be more westerns and we old goats can die happy with our boots on our guns holstered and the sun at our back humming Ricky Nelsons ""My Rifle My Pony and Me"" as we go to Jesus. Too bad its not better. Its a pretty frail reed on which to bank the genres future even with big guys Russell Crowe and Christian Bale at the center. Based on a 50s western (hardly a classic; the title song sung by the great Frankie Laine is better remembered than the actual movie) it features Crowe as Ben Wade a charismatic killer who becomes the custody of small-fry rancher Dan Evans (Bale) on a journey to the nearest depot for that train of title. If Evans way overmatched and opposed by Wades gang as well as Wade himself brings it off he gets a reward that will let him save his ranch from bigger-fry business interests. Well already you have one relic from the 50s that most movies today lack a motive. Theres an actual reason for Evanss reluctant heroics and you can throw in some other stuff Evanss sons and wife think hes too passive and heres his chance to win some man points. The remake directed by James Mangold bothers to set this up follow it through and watch it grow to obsession. Emotional coherence More movies should try the gimmick. Amazing what the results would be. But Delmer Daves who directed the original back in 57 knew a thing or two. His stars were Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. Much smarter casting Ford had a slyness under his famous earnestness and could alchemize to insincere charm projecting hidden menace while Heflin no looker had a lumpy potato face but an innate decency so the equation was right. Mangold reverses it turns the lumpy potato-face guy into the slick psycho (Crowe that is) and the male-modely pretty boy into the earnest rancher. Right from the start it feels wrong. The handsome guy should be the bad guy based on all our lumpenprole dislike of men who get women too easily. The movie feels like an uneasy combination of new and old western stylings. For example in the days before Sam Peckinpahs 1969 masterpiece ""The Wild Bunch"" it was usual for people to get shot in the stomach pour a little water on it and go on with the movie. Thats right they shook off a sucking gut wound. In the post-""Wild Bunch"" days a bullet blew a magenta cloud of viscera in slo-mo out the exit wound. So in ""310 to Yuma"" you have a weird combination a magenta cloud of pulverized viscera followed by a little water and back in the movie. It really doesnt work even if the subject of bullet and miracle cure is the ageless icon Peter Fonda wasted in a role as a bounty hunter. (He would have been superb as Ben Wade or Dan Evans) The original resolved itself into a ""High Noon"" clone ending up in a real-time scenario punctuated by clock close-ups until the whistle sounded the train arrived and all hell broke loose and we walked briskly to a happy ending in 93 minutes. It generated some real suspense as the two male archetypes -- predator and provider -- faced each other across eight feet of hotel room and a geological chasm between savagery and civilization. The remake adds 24 minutes and subtracts most of the suspense. Theres no claustrophobia and despite the artificiality of the time boundary little sense of urgency. The Stockholm-syndrome nonsense -- the bond between guys good and bad over their shared ordeal -- of the original is bloated toward total absurdity in an ending that taxes believability while pandering to modern tastes for nihilism. Neither star seems to add much to his canon; oddly enough a week after seeing the new movie in a theater on a giant screen and the old one on DVD its the old one that lingers in my mind. They had faces then. Also the old one had haunting cinematographic texture and some unusually aggressive camera moves -- crane shots moving cameras severe black-and-white cinematography that turned the final back-alley walk to the station almost to film noir. Nothing about it is singular. Mangold doesnt have Davess gift for composition or the color of dust rising in the desert or the weight of steam spurting from the 310s locomotive. About the only remarkable thing the film offers is the young actor Ben Foster as Wades No. 2 gun Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel played Charlie in the original). Its odd As he aged Jaeckel got better and better until he always registered and became one of Hollywoods leading character actors. But in the remake Foster is the whole story. He was also in ""Alpha Dog"" a tough teen docudrama a few years back and you may remember him for his eyes. Hes got steely focus and a glare that could melt a bank vault door. When hes on screen nobody else is visible. This could be a big breakthrough for him. ""310 to Yuma"" (117 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence.

"310 to Yuma Western remake outshines original | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies310 to Yuma Western remake outshines originalHear that whistle blowing coming down the track. Its the sound of that rarest of cinema offerings the remake that exceeds the original.Christian Bale centre Russell Crowe and Peter Fonda star in 310 to Yuma a remake that tops the original.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 7 2007 Starring Russell Crowe Christian Bale Peter Fonda Ben Foster and Gretchen Mol. Directed by James Mangold. At major theatres. 119 minutes. 14A  Hear that whistle blowing coming down the track. Its the sound of that rarest of cinema offerings the remake that exceeds the original.Article Continued BelowJames Mangolds 310 to Yuma an old-school Western updated for modern mores and tastes pays due homage to its 1957 predecessor itself an estimable oater. But it also suggests there was much more to the story to begin with.Taking roles originally assigned to Glenn Ford and Van Heflin Russell Crowe stars as Ben Wade the smiling scourge of Wild West money coaches with Christian Bale as Dan Evans honest rancher and accidental lawman.The plot remains much the same captured outlaw Wade is booked on the 310 train to Yuma prison heading out of Contention Ariz. Evans is obliged to get him there for a 200 fee that will save his drought-stricken cattle ranch. Easier said than done especially if Wades men have their way.For Crowe the timing couldnt be better no matter what the railway clock reads. After a series of career mistakes playing characters who beg for sympathy he opts to command our attention with a role made for his cocksure disposition.As the Bible-quoting and bird-sketching Wade who also happens to be an unblinking killer Crowe embodies the movie anti-hero that long ago supplanted the kind of gentleman villain essayed by Ford.Hes much funnier too. Accused of having used dynamite to blow up a wagonload of prospectors Wade retorts with a smirk ""Thats a lie. It was a trainful.""And as the haunted Evans a hobbled Civil War vet with guilt as deep as his dry well and a reputation to restore in the eyes of his wife and two young sons Bale brings a spiritual depth to his mission that Van Heflins character barely touched.Mangold (Walk the Line) ups the ante by fleshing out secondary characters notably Ben Foster as Wades scene-stealing psychopathic sidekick Charlie who is determined to save his boss from jail and Peter Fonda as a loyal coach guard with the constitution of Rasputin.Mangolds also changed the ending to much more dramatic effect.Female characters remain largely MIA however Gretchen Mols ranch wife Alice barely registers.But people who go to Westerns are there for the action not the home life and Mangold spectacularly delivers a hail of bullets and bloody confrontations between good guys bad guys and Apaches who stand somewhere in between. The screenplay by Halsted Welles Michael Brandt and Derek Haas working a short story by Elmore Leonard goes beyond the obvious messages of delivering justice and making your sons proud of you.In the background that whistling train represents the arrival of modern life for better or worse. These hard men are relics of a time when boundaries were up for grabs and the law was only as strong as the twitching finger on the trigger.They are all ghosts heading to destinations unknown.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Hes behind on his mortgage payments to the big landowner who wants the property back in order to sell it on the Internet -- oops sorry to the railroad. Dans cattle herd is also dwindling one of his kids is sick and the other thinks hes a coward. Even his patient wife is beginning to eye him dubiously. You really dont want to walk in Dans shoes. On the other hand theres something very attractive about the boots worn by the notorious bandit and ironist Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) -- a dapper literate sexy guy who whiles away his idle moments drawing sketches in his ever-present notebook. We are drawn more to his insouciant spirit than we are to the earnest hard-pressed (and well-played) Dan. When the rancher desperately needing the 200 fee signs on to escort the captured outlaw through hard country in order to catch the 310 to Yuma where a courthouse a trial and doubtless a necktie party await Ben we know where our moral interest is supposed to lie. But the road agent is a really cute and seductive guy steadily luring Dan into reluctantly bonding with him. Such is the power of charm to unhinge righteous principle. And such is the power of very solid genre filmmaking to disarm an audiences disbelief. Westerns as we all know are a disused movie form and part of this films appeal lies simply in returning us to the thrilling days of yesteryear to the beauty of spare narrative played out in a stark landscape. 310 is of course a remake of the 1958 movie that starred Van Heflin and Glenn Ford which was in my opinion not as good as a lot of people thought mostly because the mumbly Ford could only play one note at a time which meant he erred more toward likeability than toward menace. Thats not a problem for Crowe an actor with a teasing hair-trigger temperament who never settles for predictability when hes on screen and never lets us settle into complacency as we watch him. Something similar might be said of James Mangolds direction. Hes full of surprises too -- a discreetly sexy moment with a prostitute is a good example as is a curiously menacing encounter with railroaders blasting their way through a mountainside. With his screenwriters (Michael Brandt and Derek Haas updating Halstad Welless original) he has managed the task of expanding what amounted to a kind of chamber piece without improbably inflating it. He never loses his crispness or his narrative efficiency. Ive seen one or two comparisons of 310 to Yuma with Unforgiven. These are not entirely apt. Mangolds offering lacks the blackness and absurdity of Clint Eastwoods great film. It is more in the vein of Anthony Manns westerns of the 1950s -- trim efficiently paced full of briskly stated conflicts that edge up to the dark side but never fully embrace it. Thats quite all right. 310 to Yuma reminds us that well-made westerns -- precisely because they are such a ritualized and conventionalized form -- have an ability to isolate moral conflicts in spare essentially unrealistic contexts and thus focus our undistracted attention on those issues. Who says remakes are always inferior to the original film? And who says the western is dead? Especially when a movie is as entertaining as this one you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival.

"310 to Yuma Shut up and shoot - Mercury News Hot Topics San Diego cop killed Big Sur fire Michael Parros Lake Tahoe warming Keith Urban Alphabet hiring Star Parties Facebook tax bill Brock Turner case Ask Amy SV150 Print Email Font Resize310 to Yuma Shut up and shootOVERLY YAPPY FILM ULTIMATELY SATISFIESBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 09/07/2007 014724 AM PDTUpdated 09/07/2007 071839 PM PDT If youve ever waited two hours for a train you have a rough idea what ""310 to Yuma"" feels like. Actually if youve ever waited one hour for a train then another hour for it to leave the station and while you were sitting there you thought to yourself ""Jeez I wonder if Christian Bale is ever going to be in a movie in which he doesnt get the living hell kicked out of him"" well welcome aboard this deeply flawed yet ultimately entertaining western. Making every local stop as it chugs toward its preordained destination the movie lingers over every long meal and chatty campfire scene examining the frontier codes of honor and loyalty. It also raises profound existential questions for the audience such as why nobody just shoots Russell Crowes character in the head so we can all go home. Crowe plays the charismatic outlaw Ben Wade whose most fearsome weapon isnt the hand-tooled six-gun he employs with ruthless efficiency but his deadly psychological insights. Hes a frightening combination of Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Phil which is to say that as outlaws go Wade isnt exactly the strong silent type. The movie never shies away from talking the talk even when it should just walk the walk. Wade enjoys the sound of his own voice and Crowes buttery baritone is like a piece of well-worked leather - hard and soft at the same time.Advertisement At times Wades distinctly modern way with words arouses the suspicion that the part has been built up to keep Crowe from being overshadowed by Bales more heroic character. The movie starts promisingly enough with Wades gang robbing a stagecoach against a glorious Old West backdrop of red rock and blue sky. Director James Mangold (""Walk the Line"") appears to have made a careful study of the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone in these refreshingly silent early scenes shooting Crowe in bold close-ups framed against the big sky. The takedown of the stage - a rig that comes equipped with a Gatling gun and an ornery old bounty hunter (Peter Fonda) - and its bloody aftermath are the twin peaks of the picture from which the trail ride that follows trickles mostly downhill. But while the film is still up in the clouds the fates of Wade and rancher Dan Evans (Bale) become intertwined. Evans is a Civil War veteran with one leg two young boys and three strikes against him in the Old West version of the subprime mortgage market (the first delinquency notice is having your barn burned down). Wade uses the ranchers cattle to stop the stage and in return Evans uses the gunslingers misspent life to teach his son Will (Logan Lerman) the difference between right and wrong. The luckless Evans has lost the respect of his boy - who at 14 is in the thrall of Wades dime-novel exploits - and the regard of his wife (Gretchen Mol). This is nothing new for Bale who has suffered every physical imposture an actor can endure in such films as ""Rescue Dawn"" ""Harsh Times"" and ""The Machinist."" The ranchers role was played by Van Heflin in the original 1957 version of ""310 to Yuma"" a picture with which Mangold has been obsessed for so long that he named the determined lawman in ""Cop Land"" Heflin. But the Van Heflin role to which Bales performance owes the greatest debt is the sodbuster in ""Shane"" a good man who fearlessly faces up to a bad one teaching his son a fateful lesson in the process. This ""Yuma"" is ""Shane"" with a train. When Wade carelessly lets himself get caught the decision is made to send him to Yuma to be hanged and tried rather than stringing him up on the spot. Desperate for money to save his water-starved ranch Evans agrees to help transport Wade to the railhead in the town of Contention - although for allegorical purposes they might as well have called it Redemption. Thats what Evans is seeking. The trip is a blood bath of course which keeps raising a nagging question Why would his captors risk their lives to serve a criminal justice system that is more notional than real? Wade asks a lot of nosy infuriating questions and whenever possible he tries to kill his guards. Yet no one ever seems to think to put a sock in his mouth or for that matter a bullet. The movie rouses itself sporadically for pulse-quickening scenes most of them involving Wades wired second-in-command the strutting peacock Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). Charlies devotion to his boss is so intense that it has a kind of eruptive eroticism as if brandishing his six-guns at every opportunity were the measure of his manhood. Maybe it is. The climax of ""310 to Yuma"" is both predictable and improbable and undercuts much of what has come before it. Though the scene is supposed to belong to Crowe and Bale Foster steals it. And pretty much everything else that isnt nailed down. His train appears to have arrived. `310 to Yuma  1/2 Mercury News Rated R (violence and some profanity) Cast Russell Crowe Christian Bale Ben Foster Gretchen Mol Peter Fonda Director James Mangold Writers Halsted Welles Michael Brandt Derek Haas (based on a story by Elmore Leonard) Running time 1 hour 57 minutesContact Bruce Newman at bnewmanmercurynews.com or (408) 920-5004.

Starring Russell Crowe Christian Bale Peter Fonda and Dallas Roberts. Directed by James Mangold. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The finest American Westerns have a characteristic that ""310 to Yuma"" shares. In a way thats almost mystical they suggest a truth beyond the specifics of the tale. The story may be simple but only in the way that parables are simple. Beneath the surface there are larger issues being explored that cut to the essence of life - the struggle to survive the struggle to maintain integrity the nature of good and evil and the things of value that can be passed from father to son. The Wests vast expanses suggest moral possibility a place where there are no constraints and people can become exactly what they are sometimes for better often for worse. Women are usually on the periphery as observers. Like ""310 to Yuma"" Westerns are a male spectacle and often shake down as ruminations on manhood what it looks like what it really is and what it means. In ""310 to Yuma"" director James Mangold has made himself a grand Western. A remake of the 1957 Glenn Ford and Van Heflin film which was based on Elmore Leonards short story the new film lacks the self-conscious modernism of most Westerns of the past generation such as ""Unforgiven"" TVs ""Deadwood"" or Sergio Leones movies. The modern influences are there in its harsh language and realistic violence but theres no sense of straining for effect. It just tells a story and seemingly incidentally - though no movie can be this good by accident - it achieves an elusive mythic quality. First we get a picture of utter powerlessness. Dan (Christian Bale) is a rancher who has played by the rules his whole life and now thugs from the bank are burning down his barn. A Union Army veteran he had part of his leg shot off in the Civil War so when the bad guys come in the middle of the night he cant fight them. With no time to attach his wooden leg he can only hop around. He has two sons and a wife (Gretchen Mol) and in a week all four are going to be without a home. Cut to an image of absolute power. Wade (Russell Crowe) is a well-known and flamboyant outlaw with a loyal and ruthless gang and we first meet him as hes robbing a Pinkerton coach carrying the fortunes of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Pinkertons are armed with Gatling guns but he robs them and kills them all save for their leader (Peter Fonda) whom he keeps alive just to let him suffer. Wade is decisive and his ruthlessness commands respect from everyone while Dans virtue is losing him the respect of his eldest son (Logan Lerman) and the affection of his wife. Like Clark Gable Crowe has a manly vibe that makes any guy standing next to him look as though he might as well be wearing a dress. That seems to stack the deck against Bale when fate throws Dan and Wade good and bad powerful and powerless together. Dan is hired to help transport the outlaw on horseback for a journey of several days to the town of Contention where the 310 train will take him to trial. But getting him there wont be easy. His gang is looking for him and the journey will take them across Indian country. But the most difficult thing to deal with is Wade himself who is charming and shrewd and knows just what to say to get under peoples skin. Wade is a man who seizes life on his own terms and as such he seems like a much bigger person than Fondas angry Pinkerton or the railroad man (Dallas Roberts) or even Dan. Dans son who comes along from the ride cant help but be fascinated by Wades stories of easy women and wild living in Dodge City. Through the sons eyes the movie invites a comparison between the outlaw and Dan who together provide the boy with two possible courses or philosophical propositions. In between flare-ups of action the best scenes are those in which Wade needles Dan his moral opposite ""Your conscience is sensitive Dan. Its not my favorite part of you."" As the outlaw Crowe radiates the absolute discernment and self-assurance of a gifted bad man but Bale holds the screen by being less impressed by him than anyone in the film - or in the theater. He plays Dan as a good guy whos good not because its the easiest way to get along and avoid trouble but because his principles are unbendable. And so we watch him rise in stature. The supporting cast is strong with Fonda stone cold as the Pinkerton bounty hunter and Ben Foster seriously alarming as Wades loyal and psychopathic second-in-command. Theres evil regular and then theres Jack Palance evil. Foster achieves Jack Palance evil. -- Advisory This film contains gore violence and sexual situations.

And the answer is no they do not but for the time being the keys to the castle do not belong exclusively to Henrik Lundqvist. And at least in the short term this is not a bad thing. It is not a bad thing to have Weekes whose shutout was his first since January 2004 when he was a Hurricane performing as he did in the back-to-back sweep of Anaheim and San Jose teams that were a combined 18-4-3 before facing the Rangers. It is not a bad thing for Lundqvist to be pushed for playing time by his partner. Weekes was quick in his movements and poised facing traffic especially in the final minutes of the games as San Jose stormed the net after pulling its goal tender. No. 80 has started three in a row with Lundqvist healthy only once since the goaltenders joined forces on Broadway. The last time it happened was Nov. 3-7 excluding the games on either side of the Olympic break. Who knows whether Weekes will get his third straight against the Sabres? But while the Rangers seemed to play nervous hockey in front of Weekes last year that sure wasnt the case the last two nights. For the most part the Blueshirts were attentive to detail even if outshot decisively. They moved their feet. They supported both the puck and one another. The reunited Matt Cullen-Brendan Shanahan-Petr Prucha trio had a second successive fine evening. Cullen gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead with 00.7 of a second to go in the first converting a breakaway relay from Prucha after Shanahan had poked the puck off Joe Thorntons stick at the top of the defensive left circle. Jumbo Joe? Jumbo Shrimp. The Hart Trophy winner was miserable last night. Not only did he repeatedly turn over the puck but he lost the defensive zone face off that preceded the Martin Straka goal that gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead early in the second. The newly constituted Sandis Ozolinsh-Karel Rachunek defensive pair played intelligently and effectively for the second time in two games. Ranger forwards were diligent in getting back into their own end. Ryan Hollweg back on the wing for the second straight time created all sorts of havoc in throwing his body around. The power play continued to fail but inefficiency with the man advantage was offset by excellence while a man down. The Rangers killed five San Jose power plays last night. Last nights victory lifted the Rangers to 7-6. A year ago the Blueshirts were 6-4-3 through their first 13. Despite so much sloppy play the Blueshirts are only one point off last years pace.

Friday September 7 2007 400 AM 310 to Yuma. Remake of 1957 Western about a shy rancher and the gunman hes being paid to guard. With Russell Crowe Christian Bale Ben Foster. Director James Mangold (157). R Language violence. At area theaters. Nearly everyone involved in the 1957 psychological Western ""310 to Yuma"" is either dead or retired. But Elmore Leonard who wrote the source short story is still going strong and it is a tribute to his precocious talent that one of his earliest works has inspired an equally good adaptation a half century later. James Mangolds gritty hugely entertaining version of ""310"" stars Russell Crowe as captured stagecoach robber and ruthless killer Ben Wade and Christian Bale as Dan Evans the struggling farmer who volunteers - for a save-the-farm fee - to help get Wade on the prison-bound train to Yuma Ariz. Though ""310"" is in the sweeping style of 50s Westerns Leonards tight central focus on the test of wills between the calculating Wade and the frightened Evans is the driving force of both films. The major difference between them is that while Delmer Daves 57 version spends much of its time in the hotel room where Wade and Evans await the train the new film opens things up and makes the overland trip from where Wade is captured to the rail town of Contention far more eventful. There are attempted escapes a murder an encounter with Apaches and a shootout with a rogue posse. Evans 14-year-old son Will (Logan Lerman) also joins the guard detail against his fathers wishes and creates some drama of his own. For all the added action though the new ""310"" is ultimately dependent on the relationship between Wade and Evans and Mangold made the right choices. Unlike Glenn Ford a soft-spoken studio star who was cast against type as Wade 50 years ago Crowe is a perfect fit. Not because of his bad boy behavior offscreen but because he can blend charm and menace better than anyone. Bale is a less obvious but no less effective choice for Evans a devoted nonviolent family man who will have to stiffen his spine in order to match wits with Wade and survive the coming rescue attempt by the gunslingers gang. And Ben Foster as the Wade gangs crazy second-in-command creates a villain in the mold of Jack Palance in ""Shane.""

Photo Richard Foreman Lions Gate Films 310 to Yuma 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Like musicals Westerns rarely reach screens and always with the burden of reviving a once-dominant genre. Although no isolated hit can do that 310 to Yuma shows theres ample life left among sagebrush and six-guns. The best Western since Unforgiven 310 to Yuma is both cathartic and intelligent. While a wildly eventful action-adventure and outlaw shoot-em-up its also a vibrant story of heroism villainy and hard-earned redemption. Although often guilty of gunplay overkill director James Mangold (Walk the Line) steers Yumas eloquent dialogue and war of wills with steely-eyed conviction and his ensemble is strong across the board. But it still comes down to two stars at the top of their game Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Crowe is Ben Wade a notoriously successful boss of bandits who make their 22nd hit on Southern Railways cash as the film opens. Bale plays Dan Evans a one-legged former Union soldier whos deep in debt while trying to raise a family on his drought-plagued Arizona ranch. Desperate for money and weary of oldest son William (Logan Lerman) looking down on him as half a man Evans accepts a high-paying but risky job when Wade is captured Hell help escort him to a prison-bound train. Wades vicious but loyal gang wont sit still in the saddle for that and they give chase. Along the way and among grisly violence Wade and Evans reveal what kind of men they are at their core. They also become unacknowledged friends openly disdainful of each others life choices while quietly respectful of each others resolve. But like the train they approach their journey follows an inexorable path and little good can come of it. Or can it? Crowe is reliably charismatic as a man whos less craven and bloodthirsty than wise resourceful and expedient. Erudite and artistic crafty and ruthless he inspires equal parts fear and confidence among his men apart from trigger-happy Charlie (Ben Foster) who fears nothing. Bales crippled family man is out of place among the grizzled bounty hunters (Peter Fonda) and hateful range riders with personal debts to carve from Wades hide. But hes also the most principled and dedicated member of the escort given his face-saving -- if not soul-saving -- mission. Based on an Elmore Leonard story and a 1957 screen version starring Glenn Ford 310 to Yuma draws clear inspiration from the lonely heroics of High Noon earlier in that decade. What made that film a classic wasnt its violent confrontations but its depth of character and this new Yuma can make the same claim. Great Western drama doesnt erupt from the barrel of a gun so much as burn from the depths of a human heart. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Intex Waterproof Twin Airbed Mattress for 5 + pickup at Walmart Dell Celeron Dual 12"" Touch 2-in-1 Laptop for 195 + free...

That is not a bad question to raise after ""310 to Yuma."" Dont get me wrong. This remake of a 1957 Western about a captured outlaw bound for that titular train and justice the gang set against it and the farmer who finds his gumption in making sure said outlaw makes said train is well done. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (who worked together on ""Walk the Line"" and ""Identity"") have infused their film with some vital action sequences. The first involves a stagecoach wreck that brings the lead characters together. And the finale is weirdly involving thanks to shifting alliances and switchback camerawork. With performances by Russell Crowe as Ben Wade the lethal observant gang leader and Christian Bale as Dan Evans the hobbled farmer theres quality in them thar celluloid reels. ""310 to Yuma"" is a seemingly weighty tale about a time and place in which good and bad look black and white just before they bleed into one another. Only that revelation seems sort of old (10-gallon) hat when the tale never quite resonates beyond the screen. In this regard ""310 to Yuma"" is reminiscent of last years ""Seraphim Falls"" which starred two other fine actors - Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson. That story also re-created the tensions of the frontier (imported from the Civil War) yet didnt quite earn its keep as a truly memorable addition to the genre. Adapted by Halstead Welles Michael Brandt and Derek Haas from an Elmore Leonard short story about courage and yup manhood in the face of terror surely ""310 to Yuma"" was meant to. Evans who lost a leg in the Civil War is having trouble making payments on his farm in a parched season. The West he knows is being carved up for folks with deeper pockets. And he owes a man who sees more opportunity in developments to come which is why he has Evans barn burned down. When this humiliation occurs in front of Evans sons Bales lips clamp tighter than ever. The bullying is echoed in the way the Southern Pacific Railroad cares more for its cargo than the men who protect it. Peter Fonda plays a bounty hunter hired by the railroad. No need to be confused about his decency or drive the movie - and Wade - warns. Hes murdered Indian families in his recent past. Crowe is good (when isnt he?) at conveying the manipulative yet truth-telling gifts of his character. Theres a reason Evans doesnt want him talking to wife Alice (Gretchen Mol) or his son Will. Wade lures his listeners into deceptively calm waters. He roils. After everyone else has been killed or cowed Wade and Evans are holed up in a hotel room. With time ticking slowly Wade will try to cast the same muddying spell on Dan. Good performances fits of jarring retribution - why then doesnt ""310 to Yuma"" amount to something more? The original recently released on DVD (19.94 Sony Pictures Home Entertainment) features a bit of counter-casting with Glenn Ford in the role of the smug Ben Wade. Van Heflins Evans is not unlike the role he played in ""Shane."" Yet the fine surprise comes in director Delmore Daves two most startling scenes which feature women folk. Nothing in the remake comes close to the scene of Alice seeing a hanging man or the saloon gal Wade seduces pouring the gang its rye. These characters remain in Mangolds film. Only this rough-and-tumble version shifts all of the moral weight onto a tale of fathers and sons. Throughout much of the journey Evans son Will (Logan Lerman) meets his fathers gaze with a sour contempt. ""I aint never walking in your shoes"" he tells Evans proving teens have been honing the fine art of petulance for decades if not centuries. More interesting is the relationship between Wade and his lethal whelp of a second Charlie Prince. The true treat of the film Ben Foster (""X-Men The Last Stand"") captures the ambiguities of Princes dedication to Wade. Is it love self-serving fealty over-identification? Foster digs into Princes doggedness making it all of the above. Crowe-ing rights For all the sturm and drang over Russell Crowe you might think he had the box office draw of a Tom Cruise. But only two of his films have cracked 100 million. Heres a look at his top five films (first figure is total domestic gross second is opening weekend in millions unless noted) 1.

Comments 310 to Yuma Recommended Period westerns are so unfashionable and costly that they usually require a top-drawer script to get off the ground--and this one adapted from an Elmore Leonard story and its 1957 movie version travels with an arrows clean arc. Christian Bale is a one-legged Civil War veteran who cant keep his ranch and young family solvent; Russell Crowe is the notorious bad man who steals his cattle (and most of their scenes together). When Crowe is captured Bale signs on to help deliver him through Santa Fes striking Diablo Canyon to the prison train of the title where the poor rancher will collect a 200 reward. Like last years Seraphim Falls this harks back to the 50s westerns of Budd Boetticher and Anthony Mann with their elemental journeys and damaged men. But in Leonards stories money is always a big character and director James Mangold (Walk the Line) draws good performances from both leads as they wrestle with the predatory power structure of the old west.

Still the modernization has bestowed mixed blessings. The basic plot survives intact and intriguing as ever. The picture looks great Phedon Papamichaels elegant color cinematography has replaced Charles Lawton Jr.s elegant black-and-white cinematography. And the action sequences are impressive for a while. Yet the whole enterprise is seriously out of scale. What began half a century ago as a small taut Western has become an extended self-serious and in the end ludicrously distended spectacle that seems to bring the Yuma train to the station 20 minutes late. ENLARGE The starting point of the plot is a conflict of interests that turns into a clash of values. After the infamous Wade is captured by lawmen Evans who is broke and about to lose his ranch volunteers for a few hundred dollars to deliver the outlaw to a train that will take him to trial. Wades interest is in escaping of course or buying his escape. Evans anything but an idealist is interested only in the reward. The question is whether the rancher can be bought but its not the only question in a film originally based on a story by Elmore Leonard that explores issues of morality and integrity. Does every man have his price as Wade believes or can something more govern human behavior? (Hint Keep an eye out for something more.) Russell Crowe looking cheerfully dissolute with a smirk beneath an obligatory black hat keeps all eyes riveted on him even when the mind games Ben Wade plays with his captor wear thin. Wade is a villain by his own admission -- indeed by his own insistence -- but a complex seductive one who quotes the Bible and does an admirable pencil sketch of a woman he admires. Christian Bale a specialist in mutedness risks painting Dan Evans as a dislikable weasel as well as a mercenary but theres ample room for the characters growth and the actor fills it. (Now and then though both men grow so muted that they seem to be trying to outminimalize one another.) The director Mr. Mangold has a gift for working with actors. He displayed it in ""Walk the Line"" and he uses it here to elicit vivid performances from his supporting cast as well as his stars. (I found Peter Fondas presence particularly moving and at the other end of the chronological scale I liked Logan Lermans performance as the ranchers young son.) But the film gets to be cluttered with picturesque characters and their posturings -- a plethora of poses scowls and leers. And one can debate the ambiguities of the ending -- which substantially resembles the original -- but the febrile and semicoherent action climax that precedes it leaves logic in the dust. Instead of taking on seven gunmen as in the original the movies newly minted man of honor must now shoot his way through what amounts to a whole town. ENLARGE Russell Crowe (left) in 310 to Yuma Thats not to enshrine the 1957 version which was directed by Delmer Daves as a masterpiece that contemporary Hollywood vandals have defaced. And clearly theres no going back to a time when a small taut feature was enough to bring an audience to a theater. In our own time though when movies must compete with many media and producers want their features to be big events its worth thinking about what made the original noteworthy. The performances to be sure -- Glenn Ford and Van Heflin were superb -- and the classic theme of a single man of probity carrying the day. But the strengths of the first ""310 To Yuma"" were enhanced by its proportionality -- an intimate story told in 92 minutes. The story is no bigger in the new version which goes on for 117 minutes. And its certainly not better. In the Shadow Of the Moon Thanks to who they are and what theyre talking about the ten talking heads of ""In the Shadow Of the Moon"" are more dramatic than the heroes of most dramas. Nine of them are Apollo astronauts who have walked on the moon. One Michael Collins served as Apollo 11s command module pilot so that Neil Armstrong who doesnt appear in the film and Buzz Aldrin who does could become the first two of Earths twelve human beings who have earned that distinction. When Apollo 11 blasted off on a hot July morning in 1969 I was there at Cape Canaveral sitting cross-legged in a patch of tall grass and taking notes in a reporters notebook so Im obviously receptive to the film; it was a singular moment in my life. But it was of course a singular moment in the life of the nation a time when soaring American ambition was matched by stunning achievement. This magnificent documentary directed by David Sington and presented by Ron Howard rises to the occasion by interspersing its interviews with NASA footage that evokes the grandeur of the whole Apollo adventure. The picture quality ranges from astoundingly crude (its hard to believe that the whole world was transfixed by those blurry TV images transmitted live of Armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface) to remarkably sharp (Apollo 17s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt both interviewed here tooling around that surface in a lunar rover.) And of course we see the Apollo 8 photograph that has come to be known as ""Earthrise"" the unprecedented portrait of as one astronaut puts it ""that jewel of Earth hung in the blackness of space."" In the run-up to Apollo 11 there was whimsical talk of sending up a poet -- the favored candidate was Marianne Moore -- to tell us what the moon was really like. No consecrated poet ever made the cut but the men in this film are no slouches when it comes to language. Edgar Mitchell speaks of his ecstasy at the realization that the molecules of his body his crew and their spacecraft were all created in some ancient star. Michael Collins speaking of Apollo 11s destination says ""I did not sense any great invitation on the part of the moon for us to come into its domain. I sensed a hostile place even a scary place."" And Dave Scott speaking of our planetary launching pad says ""It truly is an oasis and we dont take very good care of it."" Words that make you think images that make you gasp.    DVD TIP Ron Howard directed ""Apollo 13"" (1995) a dramatized account of the near-disastrous mission during which three astronauts played by Tom Hanks Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton struggled to find their back to Earth in a crippled space capsule. Dramatization doesnt mean vulgarization. The film succeeds brilliantly at organizing great gobs of information into powerful drama.

That the geology of Christian Bales face was as ironbound and unforgiving as the red rock of Arizona? 310 to Yuma James Mangolds potent psychological showdown between a charismatic outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and a humorless family man Dan Evans (Bale) is a riveting remake of a pretty terrific 1957 western about manhood fatherhood and honor. Does physical strength trump moral muscle? Is cunning deadlier than a Gatling gun? Is the bond between gang members thicker than that between blood? In the urgency of its head games suspense and performances - all kept in the tightest of focus - Yuma is the sagebrush counterpart of The Departed. Set in the Arizona territory after the Civil War in towns that have names like Contention the film (based on an Elmore Leonard short story) opens as beleaguered rancher Evans out herding cattle with his sons is caught in the cross fire between the Wade Gang and the Pinkerton stagecoach delivering payroll to the Southern Pacific. Wade and his men - led by lieutenant Charlie Prince (Ben Foster fierce in his loyalty and unconcealed love) - make off with the loot. Lame from a war injury and lean from tough times Evans literally is between rock and hard place. The railroad craves his property and its goons interfere with Evans water supply and livelihood. In a prelude to what they plan to do to his homestead they set fire to the Evans barn. Honorable but physically and economically inadequate the unjolly rancher owes more money than he can possibly ever make. To regain the respect of his wife (Gretchen Mol) and elder son Will (Logan Lerman) who regard him with contempt and Wade with mesmerized respect Evans stages what would seem to be his last stand. He signs on to help deliver Wade (arrested after staying too long with a barmaid) to the prison car of a train headed for the penitentiary town of the title. Given that the righteous Evans possesses more honor than competence and that the proportions in nimble Wade are just the reverse it doesnt look like an even match. But as the men - also accompanied by bounty hunter McElroy (Peter Fonda grizzled and great) and railroad exec Butterfield (Dallas Roberts blandly corporate) gallop West the hairpin curves and switchbacks they encounter are not limited to the rocky trail. Keenly photographed by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael Yuma keeps characters and conflicts in extreme close-up while thrilling in the majesty of the Western panorama. It is the first film from Mangold best known for Walk the Line and Girl Interrupted (which garnered Oscars for Reese Witherspoon and Angelina Jolie) where the big picture has been as impressive as the individual performances. The son of minimalist artist Robert Mangold and realist painter Sylvia Plimack Mangold has an eye and a touch. Even during a protracted finale where human fish in a barrel manage to elude bullets Yuma yields performances as elemental as the landscape while it questions a culture more concerned with money than human life. 310 to Yuma 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by James Mangold based on a short story by Elmore Leonard with Russell Crowe Christian Bale Peter Fonda Ben Foster Logan Lerman and Gretchen Mol.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor September 7 2007 Save for later Saved The first big Western of the new season ""310 to Yuma"" starring Russell Crowe is upon us. It will soon be followed by ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" starring Brad Pitt. Now that Hollywood appears to have rediscovered the genre those of us who mourned its demise can once again exert our connoisseurship. Hooray I say.""310 to Yuma"" is based on a 1953 short story by Elmore Leonard which was made - four years later - into a very good Delmer Daves movie starring Van Heflin and Glenn Ford. (Its just been reissued on DVD.) The new version directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"") and starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe is larger in scope than its predecessor and significantly altered in its ending but essentially its the same old morality play. A good man who may not be entirely good is tempted by a bad man who may not be entirely bad.No genre is more ""American"" than the Western. Undoubtedly a big reason for its resurgence is its back-to-basics appeal at a time when American ideals are at war throughout the world. The current Western is a respite from all that. Theres something comfortingly elemental about ""310 to Yuma"" which doesnt pretend to be about anything but itself - its not about the Hollywood blacklist (""High Noon"") or Vietnam (""Little Big Man"") or Iraq. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Dan Evans (Bale) is an Arizona Territory rancher who was wounded as a sharpshooter fighting for the Union Army in the Civil War. Faced with a serious drought a decimated herd and a loss of respect from his wife (Gretchen Mol) and his 14-year-old son Will (Logan Lerman) Dan suddenly finds himself in a position to make some real money. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) has been captured and Dan for a price joins the posse escorting him on the three-day journey to the town where Ben will board the train bound for the federal court in Yuma. The posse which is being tracked by Bens gang is a ragtag group which includes a Bible-toting bounty hunter (Peter Fonda) who barely flinches when a bullet is removed from his gut.A posse of course is an essential appurtenance of any self respecting Western. Its been a long time - too long - since Ive heard those glorious words ""Spread out"" As the posse is methodically worn away and only Dan and Ben remain ""310 to Yuma"" becomes a study in unlikely kinship - another Western mainstay. Dan knows Ben is a better man than many who have hunted him down. But he never forgets that Ben is a killer.Bale acts as if hes still playing the POW survivalist from Werner Herzogs ""Rescue Dawn."" His hyperrealistic performance is a drag next to Crowes dapper prince of darkness. Crowe understands that the classic Western villains wear their mythology like a cape. His underplaying here is in many ways as hammy as if he were overplaying and thats just fine.Mangold and his screenwriters arent trying to be revisionists. Ben is celebrated in the dime novels of the day and in person he still seems larger than life. Because Dans son idealizes Ben or at least the Ben of the dime novels the movie turns on the notion of heroism. Dans heroics in the end become a match for Bens antiheroics and Will learns to love his father.This drippy father-son stuff is the least successful aspect of the movie perhaps because its overly familiar not only from other Westerns but also from all-too-many current contemporary films. Who can blame Will for being starry-eyed around Ben? From a didactic standpoint the problem with most morality plays this one included is that the villains are almost always more exciting than the champions of decency.On the other hand what Alfred Hitchcock once said about thrillers also applies to Westerns The stronger the bad guy the better the film. By that measure ""310 to Yuma"" is excellent. Grade B+ Rated R for violence and some language.

The first 310 to Yuma with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin in the lead roles now played by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale was adapted from the Leonard story by Welles both of whom received writing credits on the remake. The original version has been considerably expanded from the 92-minute running time of a 50s programmer to a two-hour epic of the post Civil War Wild West as befits a 21st-century Hollywood A-picture star vehicle for Oscar winner Russell Crowe. What has been preserved is the essentially buddy-buddy bad-man/good-man chemistry of the original which had Glenn Ford usually typecast as the bland hero reversing his image to play a humorously charismatic villain with a weakness for women opposite Van Heflin as a desperately struggling farmer with a wife and children so close to ruin that he jumps at the offer of the stagecoach company to pay him 200 to put the outlaw Ben Wade on the 310 to Yuma to stand trial before being hanged. In the remake Christian Bale plays the farmer Dan Evans with some extra biographical details like having a bad limp from an amputated foot sustained in the war on the Union side as a member of the Massachusetts Volunteers. Most of the other men in the film seem to have fought for the Confederacy and Dan takes some good-natured ribbing on the subject from Crowes outlaw chieftain Ben Wade. There is more greed-driven corruption in the remake than there was in the original and the striving for social significance is similarly enhanced by showing Chinese coolies working on the Transcontinental Railroad through the Arizona mountainside across which Dan and several deputies must pass to take Ben Wade to the town of Contention for the train to Yuma. Another difference between the two versions is the number of killings along the way. Actually I lost count after the first 20. Still I cant be more specific about what happens amid all the carnage because that is where all the fun and suspense come in and besides the 1957 version is now available on DVD. Suffice it to say that Mr. Crowes Ben Wade is vastly amusing as a Renaissance man outlaw with an eye for the ladies and a talent for sketching the likeness of everyone he encounters. He is constantly needling Dan about his not providing adequately for his beautiful wife Alice played here by Gretchen Mol; Leora Dana played Alice in the original. Fittingly enough Ben Wade is captured in both versions only because he dallied too long with a sexually complaisant barmaid played by Vinessa Shaw in the remake and by Felicia Farr in the original. All four actresses are more than adequate as frontier Eves capable of either inspiring men to tame the wilderness or luring them to their doom. In the supporting cast of the new version Peter Fonda as vengeful bounty hunter Byron McElroy and Ben Foster as Ben Wades loyal but psychotically homicidal second-in-command Charlie Prince are especially memorable. The part of Dans older son Will (Logan Lerman) has been much expanded and enriched in the remake. The cinematography of Phedon Papamichael and the production design of Andrew Menzies deserve special mention for their scope and sensitivity in creatively reinventing a noble genre. And the performances of Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale alone are worth the price of admission. As for Mr. Mangold he has scored previously with Heavy (1995) Cop Land (1997) Girl Interrupted (1999) Kate amp; Leopold (2001) to a lesser extent with Identity (2003) and to a much greater extent with Walk the Line (2005). Who knows? He may have another winner with 310 to Yuma. I certainly hope so. Comment Filed under At the Movies Trending Now Why Does Selena Gomez Make Half a Million Dollars for Instagram Posts?

What this version offers is the chance to watch Russell Crowe and Christian Bale--two of the more charismatic macho leading men around--duke it out psychologically while another fine but less well-known intensity artist Ben Foster steals whatever scenes are left.Bale plays beleaguered rancher Dan Evans whos hobbled by a Civil War injury. Unable to pay his bills hes lost the respect of his wife (Gretchen Mol) and 14-year-old son Will (Logan Lerman) and is about to lose his ranch. Evans glimpses a chance for both money and redemption by signing up to bring the legendary outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) to the train station in Contention Ariz. where the 310 will take Wade to face justice in Yuma.Crowes Wade is everything the struggling rancher isnt--suave confident a master manipulator who doesnt need to raise his voice to command the loyal admiration of his bloodthirsty gang. Wade may kill and rob for a living but hes got an artistic side (he sketches) and his aura bedazzles Dans impressionable son. Crowe works in the part because like the character he doesnt have to break a sweat to cast his spell. Bale on the other hand practically lunges off the screen his face so taut he suggests a man bursting at the seams. Hes not an obvious choice to play a guy riddled with self-doubt but he uses his roiling intensity to suggest a man tripping over his own demons. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Thanks largely to these two actors ""310 to Yuma"" builds up some steam as a character-driven action film even when we dont quite believe what were watching. Without giving anything away lets just say that in the interests of a socko finale Wade behaves in ways even Crowe cant make us swallow. The screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas dont improve matters by embellishing the original script written by Halsted Welles--and adding more than 30 minutes to the running time. Theyve also expanded the role of Evanss son but havent we seen the trigger-happy boy who wants to prove his mettle to overcome the shame he feels about his dad once too often?Much more fun is the psychotic sexually ambiguous Charlie Prince the most ruthless and loyal (and stylishly dressed) of Wades vicious gang. The gifted Foster (""Six Feet Under"" ""X-Men 3"") practically vibrates with perverse blood lust. Mangolds movie heavy on close-ups and dubious psychology is lucky to have three such high-wattage performers to keep it afloat.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"310 To Yuma | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 3-10-to-yuma ) 310 To Yuma (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once upon a time the Western served the function that currently resides within the purview of Science Fiction use an allegorical approach to explore themes and ideas that might not fit well within the scope of a traditional motion picture. It has been more than 35 years since the Western was a popular genre but when one is well-made it can still arrest the attention and transport the viewer to another place and time. Of course few modern Westerns take the simplistic view of cowboys/good-Indians/bad; we have come beyond that. 310 to Yuma is one of those complex films that twists morality and toys with the notion of the outlaw as a folk hero. Its modern in its perspectives and approach - even though its based on a staid 50-year-old original (which in turn was adapted from an Elmore Leonard short story). Its the Old West as we know it stagecoaches horses gunfights ramshackle towns that appear to have sprung out of nowhere and bad guys who are more dangerous when they smile than when they frown. The only thing missing are the tumbleweeds. Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) has studied his John Ford and Howard Hawks. He has assembled a respectable cast with Christian Bale playing opposite Russell Crowe and recognizable names like Peter Fonda Ben Foster and Gretchen Mol in supporting roles. It wouldnt be fair to claim that this is the best Western thus far in 2007 since its the only Western thus far in 2007 (although The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is on the way) but its worth the investment of time and money. For Dan Evans (Christian Bale) the capture of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) represents opportunity. Dan needs cash to save his ranch - he owes money and foreclosure is in the picture. Despite having lost part of one leg in the Civil War Dans a sharpshooter and proves an important addition to the group escorting Ben to a train station where hell board the 310 to Yuma Prison where a hangmans noose awaits. Also in the group are Dans 14-year-old son William (Logan Lerman) and a bounty hunter named Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) who has a long standing feud with Ben. The trip doesnt go well. The trail is fraught with peril including bloodthirsty Apaches and vigilante railroad workers. And all the way Bens gang is in pursuit led by the vicious Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) who wants nothing more than to see Ben free and those who captured him dying horrible deaths. Two things of significance occur during 310 to Yuma and both revolve around Dan. As a character he doesnt change. Instead hes the instigator of change in those around him. Dan is the same at the end as at the beginning devoted to what is right. Justice is his master. He will not kill because it is expedient. He will not turn his back even though he stands to earn a fortune. Dans obdurateness makes him a wall against which others crash and break. One of those is his son who starts out the film viewing him with contempt but grows to respect him. The other is Ben who suffering from something akin to Stockholm Syndrome forms a grudging respect for the man who rejects his bribes and stays true to his course. In some ways it can be argued that Christian Bale has a thankless job. After all theres nothing showy in playing a stubborn rigorously just man. Bale however brings intensity to the role. On the other hand Russell Crowe has the plum part as the villain who can be nasty one moment and charming the next. Its the kind of role Crowe plays so well. Bens the bad guy but its hard not to like him. The real one to get the boos and hisses when he appears on screen is Ben Foster who makes Charlie as freakish and dangerous as a five-headed snake. Not only is he venomous but he kills for the pleasure of it. Veteran actor Peter Fonda provides a link to the Westerns of old - his dad Henry appeared in his share of them. This isnt director Mangolds first genre effort although it is his first Western. True to form however the action is secondary to character development and the highlighting of moral dilemmas. Thats not to say the action isnt well choreographed. The 30-minute finale which includes a tense stand-off with Bens gang is masterfully executed. Its perfectly paced suspenseful and ends in a way thats both appropriate and satisfying. Watching a movie like this I cant help but wish that the Western would come back into favor again. We can use more productions like this. 310 To Yuma (United States 2007) Director James Mangold Cast Christian Bale Russell Crowe Peter Fonda Ben Foster Logan Lerman Gretchen Mol Screenplay Halsted Welles and Michael Brandt amp; Derek Haas based on the short story by Elmore Leonard Cinematography Phedon Papamichael Music Marco Beltrami U.S. Distributor Lionsgate Run Time 200 U.S. Release Date 2007-09-07 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Profanity Sexual Situations Nudity) Genre WESTERN Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Dances with Wolves (1969) High Noon (1969) Man Who Shot Liberty Valance The (1962) worse movies of this genre Cimarron (1931) Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford The (2007) Lone Ranger The (2013) Three...better movies of Christian Bale Dark Knight The (2008) Batman Begins (2005) American Psycho (2000) worse movies of Christian Bale Im Not There (2007) Swing Kids (1993) Laurel Canyon (2003) Three...better movies of Russell Crowe Proof (1969) Beautiful Mind A (2001) Gladiator (2000) worse movies of Russell Crowe Virtuosity (1995) Broken City (2013) Winters Tale (2014) Three...better movies of Peter Fonda Limey The (1999) (There are no more better movies of Peter Fonda) worse movies of Peter Fonda Ghost Rider (2007) (There are no more worst movies of Peter Fonda) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=425,200,310toyuma(2007)28,310toyuma(2007),reelviews

By David Denby Scarlett Johansson plays Nanny in the movie version of the best-seller.   Credit TOM BACHTELL In the 2002 best-seller ""The Nanny Diaries"" the N.Y.U. graduates Nicola Kraus and Emma McLaughlin who had spent some time taking care of children on the Upper East Side pooled their anecdotes merged into a single voice and compiled a fiction about a young nannys suffering at the hands of a tyrannical Park Avenue couple. The book was both a cry of exasperation and an attack on the fatuity of wealth. Near the beginning the heroine walks into a room and encounters what she calls ""the full range of Upper East Side diversity--half the women are dressed in Chanel suits and Manolo Blahniks half are in six-hundred-dollar barn jackets looking as if they might be asked to pitch an Aquascutum tent at any moment."" This is clever I suppose yet the list of boutique products suggests that the heroine has pretty much the same values as the women shes teasing without having anything like their money. Parts of ""The Nanny Diaries"" read like a peculiarly self-pitying and envious piece of magazine journalism in which the upscale knowingness of the victim serves only to fuel her outrage over how badly shes being treated. The book more snark than satire provides eager glimpses of emotional squalor and lousy parenting among the super-rich; it seems to be written for people who want to feel superior to the swells whose goods they in fact covet. The talented writer-director team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (""American Splendor"") who did the movie adaptation obviously realized that they had to change the disingenuous point of view. They have turned the nanny--or as shes called by her boss ""Nanny"" (Scarlett Johansson)--into a New Jersey girl whose mother is a hardworking nurse. She is now a genuine outsider. And theyve created a sprightly new voice for her. She studied anthropology in college and she narrates a mock field report in which she examines among other exotic creatures and tribes a specimen known as Upper East Side Natives. We see these strange people at the Museum of Natural History standing behind glass in a diorama. Blond stiff and lean they appear to be yearning for some ideal Nantucket of the mind. Propelled by such debonair flourishes the movie takes off nicely. The enormous East Side apartment in which Nanny works has a slightly exaggerated gleam as if the glass and porcelain had been created in a diamond mine. The adulterous dad known only as Mr. X (Paul Giamatti) may be a caricature of boredom and moneyed contempt but as Mrs. X Laura Linney finds something both scary and touching in the situation of a woman frightened of her own needy little boy and desperate to please her vile husband. We wait for some sort of commanding narrative to take hold. Alas none does. ""The Nanny Diaries"" despite many bright moments and a superior level of craftsmanship is now a flabby urban fairy tale. Nanny is treated like an indentured servant by Mrs. X and when a handsome young man in the building--Harvard Hottie (Chris Evans) hes called--advises her to quit her job and she doesnt the movies senselessness becomes obvious. She tells Harvard Hottie that she has fallen in love with the familys little boy Grayer (Nicholas Reese Art) who needs her. But Nicholas Reese Art a towhead with leather lungs and a face like a closed fist is not a likable child--he has no personality at all--and Scarlett Johansson trying to give the material a plausible emotional center looks merely confused. At some level Pulcini and Springer Berman must know that a white college-educated nanny with many career opportunities is not a character who can legitimately generate much pathos because suddenly out of nowhere they throw in a scene in which an African and two Latino nannies turn to the camera and complain (rightly) that they are trapped in their jobs. Nanny is trapped only by the falsity of the plot. The material has been turned into a trivially narcissistic product for teen-age girls who want to feel indignant about wrongs they are unlikely to suffer. Mrs. X a kind of wicked stepmother wont let Nanny see her young man. But Harvard Hottie a prince in a college workout shirt outsmarts the boss. He pursues Nanny anyway and wont take no for an answer. At the bloody end of ""310 to Yuma"" virtually all the surviving characters not to mention a variety of strangers get shot at point-blank range. Its almost as if the stage were being cleared for some subsequent installment of what weve just been watching--the eternal conflict of good and evil in the Old West. There havent been many big-screen Westerns recently but the form has lost none of its slightly absurd solemnity. It hasnt lost its physical beauty either or its fervent seriousness about honor and courage. ""310 to Yuma"" is a remake of a 1957 Western directed by Delmer Daves and this version--directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas who amplified Elmore Leonards 1953 story and Halsted Welless script for the original--is faster more cynical and more brutal than the first. The setting is the Arizona territory after the Civil War a wilderness with towns so ragged and insubstantial that they seem merely scratched onto the surface of the desert. Vengeful Apaches keep travellers awake at night and Chinese coolies working for the Southern Pacific Railroad lay track across the mountains. Nothing resembling a social structure exists; individual character for good or for ill is all there is. In minor roles the actors loom up at a saloon window or sit heavily on horseback and each anonymous face carved by terrible food rotten liquor and bad sex makes an overwhelming impression of loneliness and discomfort. Peter Fonda who is always described by publicists as an ""icon"" shows up as a corrupt and violent bounty hunter--a thug with authority--and gives an amazingly fierce performance. In this movie Fonda really is iconic. ""310 to Yuma"" may be familiar but at its best it has a rapt quality even an aura of wonder. The hero Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a Civil War veteran with a stump for a foot; he has come out from Massachusetts with his family and holds a few acres of parched ground but he finds himself stranded in a moral wasteland. His barn gets burned down by a powerful man who wants him to clear off and in the hills near his property he runs into the notorious outlaw and murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). When they meet again in town in a dark saloon a bizarre thing happens Wade finds the virtuous Dan so interesting that he lets his guard down. Pinkertons working for the railroad enter the building and capture him and Dan dead broke becomes part of a group being paid good money to convey the famous killer across the desert and deposit him in a train heading for prison. During the journey Wade murders two of his captors and he makes a prolonged attempt to reason or bully Dan into letting him go. The stolid rancher has a moral core that provokes him--he cant fathom it and wants to destroy it. Most of this might have been little more than a heavyweight conceit were it not for Russell Crowe. Within minutes of his first appearance he convinces you that Ben Wade is the most intelligent man in the territory. Wade is accompanied by a band of killers including a dandified acolyte in buckskins (the gifted Ben Foster) who is fanatically loyal to him and Crowe separates himself from Foster and the other actors creating a quiet private space in which he can play. This cultivated gangster likes to observe other people; he draws pictures of anyone who interests him and quotes Biblical verse--hes an aesthete and an ironist--and Crowe dominating every situation with a violent lunge or a vicious remark gives a fascinating self-amused performance (I was reminded of Marlon Brando at his most perverse). Crowe is an acting genius and the filmmakers build him up--they create a chaotic milieu in which Wades nihilism comes off as a particularly nasty form of survivors wisdom. In the Arizona territory theres no law to speak of; the Southern Pacific corrupts everyone buying whatever ""justice"" it needs to conduct its business. Dan turns out to be the only one foolish enough to finish the job and bring the bad guy to prison. His defense of a civilization that doesnt yet exist is an expression of personal honor and its so ornery and irrational that it moves even Ben Wade. James Mangolds movies include ""Cop Land"" (1997) ""Girl Interrupted"" (1999) and ""Walk the Line"" (2005) and this is by far his most sustained and evocative work. A scene in which Wades gang robs a stagecoach has a convulsive violence that makes it one of the best versions of this generic episode ever filmed. Mangold draws out the tensions between the actors--between Crowe and Fonda for instance--and when the violence explodes its startling. There are a few choppy moments--an Indian attack at night is more suggested than staged--and I wish Mangold had resisted digital enhancement in a scene in which Wade and Dan blow up a railway tunnel (the moment looks fake). But much of this Western is tense and intricately wrought and I found myself settling into its stern logic and its physical splendor with a grateful sigh. The old rituals are so far removed from our glib media world that they seem as solid as the hills and boulders of Arizona itself.

""310 to Yuma"" is a tense rugged redo of a film that was pretty good the first time around. Reinforced by a strong central premise alert performances a realistic view of the developing Old West and a satisfying dimensionality in its shadings of good and evil James Mangolds remake walks a fine line in retaining many of the originals qualities while smartly shaking things up a bit. A Western these days needs to be more than a solid unfussy programmer to break out of the pack commercially but this Lionsgate release should be able to generate moderately good theatrical returns prior to a solid home entertainment life where casual viewer curiosity will be well rewarded. Russell Crowe may be the biggest name in the cast but one curious sidelight of the project is that the author of the 1953 short story on which the original 1957 film is based Elmore Leonard reps far more of a draw now than he did half a century ago. Tightly focused yarn was at the time viewed as firmly in the Western-with-a-conscience camp of ""High Noon"" in which lawmen and ordinary citizens alike were tested by their willingness to confront the evil in their midst. Unlike in ""High Noon"" however the man putting himself on the line here is not a sheriff or marshal but a lame rancher whose life and family are just one bad season from coming apart at the seams. In the first of many tight anxious scenes fraught with violence or the threat of it the barn of Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is set afire. But Dans vow of vengeance falls on deaf ears; so seemingly ineffectual has he become that his wife (Gretchen Mol) and older son Will (Logan Lerman) differ only in the degrees of their loss of faith in him. In a subsequent bracing scene a wild bunch led by the dapper Ben Wade (Crowe) attacks a payroll coach with a Gatling gun. Numerous bloody deaths ensue but so does a big payoff for Ben who after his men take off tarries too long with a luscious barmaid (Vinessa Shaw) in a nearby town and is arrested with Dans help. Although tempted to kill the notorious outlaw on the spot local authorities prudently decide to turn him over the feds for official hanging. This however will involve transporting him to the railway town of Contention where in two days time Ben can be put on the train to Yuma. To pay off his debt Dan volunteers to help escort Ben to his destination. Thus begins a war of nerves that plays out in tasty ways across a vivid landscape. Although handcuffed and surrounded by several armed men its Ben who sets the tone and exerts the power. Quoting Scripture when it suits the occasion he elicits information with seemingly innocuous questions taunts his guards and baits Dan about his missing leg and inability to support his family or please his beautiful wife. An excellent judge of character and master manipulator he manages to kill one then another of his guards and is on the verge of getting away when who should turn up in a pinch but young Will who wants to help his dad but harbors an ill-concealed admiration for the charismatic bandit. As the diminishing group proceeds through renegade Apache territory and into a mountainous railway construction site they are shadowed by Bens remaining gang headed in his absence by his No. 2 the psychopathic Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). If anyones going to gain the most career-wise from ""310 to Yuma"" it will definitely be Foster who puts the kind of indelible imprint on this juicy role that in earlier eras allowed such thesps as Lee Marvin Richard Boone Dan Duryea James Coburn Jack Palance Lee Van Cleef Strother Martin and others to immortalize themselves in the annals of Western villainy. With his albino coloring pinched mouth reedy voice and remorseless wall-eyes Fosters lightning-draw killer brandishes a dementia amplified by an intense loyalty to Ben that gently borders on homoeroticism; hell do anything for his boss for some reasons that are clear and for some that must be intuited. Foster is a mad delight to watch and a reminder that the relative scarcity of Westerns deprives a generation of character actors of opportunities to shine. Eventually the few surviving wayfarers wind up in Contention to await the train. The least satisfying aspect of the original film -- which was confidently directed by Delmer Daves and written by Halsted Welles who receives shared script credit here with Michael Brandt and Derek Haas -- was the ending which wrapped things up too thoroughly. Conclusion has been significantly altered here with an eye toward more complex layering of emotion and meaning. But qualms persist as aspects of the physical action and psychological motivation remain murky and forced. All the same ""Yuma"" provides an absorbing ride with helpful contributions from all hands. Honoring tradition in the storytelling but pushing for a heightened visual realism Mangold has lenser Phedon Papamichael thrust the camera right into the action with a lot of handheld and perspective shots that must keep pace with constantly mobile characters horses and coaches. Michael McCuskers cutting and the clangy propulsive score by Marco Beltrami keep a cattle prod on the proceedings. Crowe is completely in his element here as in the best tradition of great stars he betrays no effort in conveying the masculine confidence psychological acuity and manipulative power of his alluring bad guy; his Ben is one slick customer and more. Bale whom one can imagine being effective in his own way as the villain well embodies the strengths and frailties of the Eastern-bred rancher without sentimentality and Lerman earns notice as a kid ready to skip adolescence and burst into full-blown manhood. Supporting turns are vivid including a wonderfully leathery characterization by Peter Fonda as a supremely tough old bounty hunter. 310 to YumaProductionA Lionsgate release presented in association with Relativity Media of a Tree Line Films production.
