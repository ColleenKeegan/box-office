But what happens if having made your name with crowd-pleasing Eurotrash like Transporter 3 you feel the urge to branch out from the usual punch-drunk potboilers and offer audiences something with a little more meat on the bones?Colombiana is a prime example of a journeyman reaching for the stars. The plot - one-woman army Cataleya (Zoe Saldana pictured) goes after the drug barons who murdered her pops - promises straight action thrills. But Megatons self-serious treatment attempting to tick multiplex-friendly action boxes while offering an exploration of loss and the drive for revenge just doesnt work. The result is a thriller undone by its own dramatic pretensions.Saldana is impressive as the slinky assassin and a nailbiting prison-cell murder sequence showcasing her Lycra-clad athletic prowess is the films highlight. Like her director Saldana struggles with the more weighty material but thats the fault of the script more than her restrained delivery. Perhaps Megaton should be lauded for trying to push the multiplex envelope and there are moments when Colombiana almost succeeds. The director is adept at knocking together a decent set-piece from parkour-style chases to trigger-happy home invasions but his desire to deliver a treatise on isolation and grief - down to the inappropriate appearance of Johnny Cashs Hurt  - renders his film tiresome and unconvincing.

Comments click to enlarge Colombiana Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2011 Often improbable sometimes ludicrous but frequently exciting this is the latest attempt by producer-screenwriter Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita) to peddle his notion of a feminist action blockbuster. In this case that means a movie in which a beautiful assassin (Zoe Saldana) runs around in her underwear (or less) kills for hire or for private reasons tries to avenge the drug-related murders of her Colombian parents eludes a somber FBI agent (Lennie James) beds a sensitive painter (Michael Vartan) and tries to express her feelings to him. Saldana makes this watchable James supplies a fitful plausibility and director Olivier Megaton (a former graffiti artist) keeps things racing along preposterously.

More than any single person Besson is responsible for popularizing what Colombiana embodies--weightless kinesis in international action filmmaking--and has produced a body of work filled with warrior women (La Femme Nikita The Fifth Element). The latest long-stemmed action figure off the line is Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) introduced as a child eluding assassins in a headlong rush down the hilly districts of Bogota in a standout set piece. The bulk of the film however takes place in the U.S. where Cataleya has trained as an assassin under her uncle (Cliff Curtis) grown to fill out an Irma Vep catsuit and is leaving a trail of bad-guy corpses as a beacon and warning sign to her parents murderers. The action is recorded in the EuropaCorp house style of jittery monotony never resorting to one camera setup when ten might suffice. The script has been approached as a great vessel to tumble cliches into snide CIA men; FBI-procedural filler; ""Never forget where you came from""; ""You must expect the unexpected."" No dont. Possibly worth seeing if you are 13 as the hot Rihanna-looking chick shows sideboob.

The child actress who plays Cataleya when her parents are slain by a Bogota crime lord is strikingly robotic and Saldana is only marginally more animated. Sheas dressed and shot to emphasize her sylvan frame with its endless thighs and tidy derriere and she steals across rooftops and wriggles through ventilator shafts with aplomb like Feuilladeas Irma Vep crossed with Bessonas la femme Nikita. But Saldanaas thinness is also alarming You say aYowzaa and then aYikesa In close-up sheas drawn and hollow-eyed with a voice that a even if itas hers a doesnat sound as if itas coming from her head. Sheas too listless and strung-out and weirdly disembodied to make you feel much empathy. Theres bad acting all around but you cant fully blame the performers. The dialogue needed a writer to come in and punch it up -- the lines sound like placeholders. The director who goes by the name of Olivier Megaton did snazzy work in another Besson-produced thriller Transporter 3 but in that one he had Jason Statham -- a witty actor as well as an athlete -- to ground the action. Here the fast cutting isnt in sync with the heroines heavy spirit and Megatons tricks are getting old. Your granny would roll her eyes at the hyperspeed rat-tat-tat interspersed with shell casings bouncing in slow motion. Colombiana has one good fight hand-to-hand in a bathroom between Saldana and Jordi Molla as the one bad guy with a distinctively creepy vibe He likes being intimate with the people he kills. Megaton cuts the action so fast that the blows are half seen like colliding streaks of light and dark almost abstract. But the movie is abstract too and passionless. When Johnny Cashs ""Hurt"" -- one of the most heartfelt covers ever recorded -- played over the closing credits I wanted to storm the projection booth and turn off the sound. Now that would be the basis of a rousing action picture.

(TriStar Pictures)By Tirdad Derakhshani Inquirer Staff WriterPosted August 27 2011Zoe Saldanas gritty nasty little action thriller Colombiana offers the tagline ""Revenge is beautiful."" Doesnt take an ethicist to tell you thats just wrong. So is this French-produced piece of pure action from director Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3) and producer and cowriter Luc Besson who unleased three decades of action movies and TV with his equally preposterous - and yes equally delicious - 1990 film La Femme Nikita. Delicious? Megatons slick 100 miles-a-second pic which has the petite 33-year-old Saldana kill her way through virtually the entire Colombian underworld has the subtlety of a sledgehammer but its a guilty pleasure for action junkies. Nikitas got nothing on Saldana who showed off her athletic prowess and fighting skills in Avatar. Here shes in hyper-drive as Cataleya (like the rare orchid) a Colombian orphan who grows up vowing to avenge her gangster parents murder by other gangsters. Megaton fleshes out the backstory opening with a surprisingly fresh 20-minute sequence that features the charming child actor Amandla Stenberg as young Cataleya. Decked out in a school uniform and pigtails Cataleya 1.0 is doing homework at the kitchen table when Marco (the fine Spanish thesp Jordi MollA  in yet another gangster role) and his henchmen come for her parents. She wounds Marco with a hunting knife (she may be 10 but shes got spunk) and evades a dozen heavily armed villains to seek asylum at the American Embassy. Lucky for Cataleya her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) a low-level gangster in Chicago takes her in and shows her how to become the best darned killer in the world. Cut to 15 years later Cataleya 2.0 (Saldana) is an assassin in Emilios employ. But instead of going to the beach on her down time she tracks down and kills every sleazeball ever associated with Big Bad Marco. As FBI special agent Ross (the superb Brit actor Lennie James) informs the audience Cataleya offed 22 dudes in four years. Megaton tries hard in Colombiana to establish Saldana as a newer sexier action-star-slash-sex-symbol. He treats us to such sights Saldana in an impossibly tight black catsuit; Saldana in tank top and impossibly teeny denim shorts; Saldana in the shower. Sexier still theres Saldana in the tank top and impossibly teeny shorts wielding a machine gun Saldana with rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Its hard sometimes to suspend disbelief as in a scene when a barefoot Saldana in her skivvies flees a massive phalanx of S.W.A.T. commandos while dragging along a sniper rifle thats taller - and probably heavier - than she is. Colombiana isnt the last word in action movies but its a fun ride. And so wrong. Colombiana 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Olivier Megaton.

Not a lot of old happily retired people in the Colombian drug cartels you know? Anyway the girl Cataleya (played as a 9-year-old by a firecracker named Amandla Stenberg) makes her way to Chicago where her uncle (Cliff Curtis) lives and there she is trained in the ways of vengeance assassination and so forth. All of which sounds like perfectly good fodder for a high-octane action thriller does it not? Instead Colombiana is disappointing Euro-cheese written and produced by Euro-cheese aficionados Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Bessons protege the comically pseudonymed Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3). These fellows would have done well to re-watch some of the stupid-cool action flicks that inspired them -- including some of Bessons -- to remind themselves of the basics go big or go home; maintain a fast pace; and keep things short. We jump ahead 15 years. Cataleya now played by the beautiful but emaciated Zoe Saldana has been bumping off bad guys one at a time in an effort to draw out the guy shes really after whos hiding in the U.S. under the CIAs protection. Our introduction to her as an adult sets a precedent for the rest of the movie she assassinates one of her targets by executing a plan -- all by herself -- that requires her to do several physically impossible things while relying on an intricate knowledge of floor plans security measures and schedules that she could not possibly know some of which would in fact be impossible to predict. When she isnt performing superhuman feats of mind-reading and acrobatics shes carrying on a pointless relationship with a guy named Danny (Michael Vartan) who doesnt know her real name or anything else about her but loves having sex with her. Somehow he thinks he has fallen in love with her for real though this is unlikely not to mention boring. Meanwhile an FBI agent (Lennie James) is hunting this mysterious assassin eager to learn whos killing all the bad guys so he can thank her I guess. Dangerous game of cat-and-mouse etc. You know the drill. Youll know it really well by the time the movie is over because it sticks to the formula without deviation. If Colombiana were 25 minutes shorter it would probably be an agreeably dumb action flick. But since we cant possibly be expected to take any of it seriously -- right? RIGHT?? -- why try our patience by dragging things out for 107 minutes? We all love a steamy pile of frivolous nonsense now and then but it has to move quickly or we lose interest like a joke that stops being funny. Megaton and company do know its a joke right? RIGHT??

Share Tweet The latest bag of pork rinds from producer Luc Besson a leading purveyor of high-calorie/low-nutrition entertainment Colombiana opens with a little girl witnessing her parents murder in Colombia moving to America and coming back to take revenge as an adult. Basically its Robert De Niros subplot in The Godfather Part II fused with the slick assassination games of Bessons breakthrough film La Femme Nikita. Coppola initially turned down The Godfather for fear it would glorify gangsterism; it was only after he found a metaphor for capitalism and more richly a vehicle through which to tell a story about family that he had the rationale to do it. In lifting the Godfather II plotline for its own dubious ends Colombiana goes about its business in precisely the opposite way It uses a story about family as a vehicle for glorifying gangsterism. In other words its empty amoral and--in the style of other Besson productions--surprisingly easy to digest. After an exciting prologue that has her preteen self nimbly skirting through the slums of Bogota--shades of Bessons parkour hit District B13--Avatars Zoe Saldana emerges 15 years later as a slinky assassin intent on vengeance. Trained in the deadly arts by a relative (veteran character actor Cliff Curtis inexplicably projecting Al Pacino in Scarface) Saldana is first seen getting arrested and thrown in jail as part of a truly irresistibly ridiculous plot to kill someone from the inside. With 22 hits under her belt--all of them scumbags who deserved it of course--she draws the attention of the FBI but remains an elusive target. But her duties as a professional assassin are really a roundabout way of returning to Columbia to take out the brandy-snifter-sipping crime boss who murdered her parents. Director Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3) makes Colombiana in the Besson house style Thinly textured and technically proficient with a cartoonishness that takes it out of the real world. In a typically insane early scene Curtis shows the schoolgirl-aged heroine what being a killer is like by opening fire on a random streetcar in broad daylight and casually walking away as if nothing happened. Yet Saldanas occupation makes little sense in the story other than to log time before she gets her revenge so the film mostly just spins its wheels tacking on a stultifying romantic subplot with Michael Vartan as a crude means of showing that shes human. We know shes human. Its the movie thats a machine.

The movie follows her on an incessant journey to knock off the men responsible for her parents untimely demise. With a nimbleness matched only by her perfect hair she scales walls lays homemade explosive charges swims with sharks and never hesitates to pull the trigger. Short of the end credits nothing can stop her. Its hard to keep track of everything Cataleya does which puts her in familiar company. In an excellent two-part video essay posted this week on Press Play Los Angeles scholar and filmmaker Matthias Stork details a trend in modern action movies -- as well as musicals another genre devoted to intense visual stimuli -- that he aptly labels ""chaos cinema."" Stork juxtaposes the frenzied and often incoherent technique that plagues many modern-day blockbusters with the comparative lucidity of earlier efforts. He lays out a clear distinction between the ""riveting and stabilizing"" rhythm of shots and cuts in ""Die Hard"" with the garbled montage of gunfire and explosions in ""Quantum of Solace."" Combining a detailed voiceover with a vast selection of clips Storks fine-tuned essay combats the exact tendency to ""trade visual intelligibility for sensory overload"" that he critiques. At the same time I fear that the ""chaos cinema"" label casts too wide a net. ""Colombiana"" certainly trafficks in a form of visual mayhem but theres an underlying fluidity. From one shot to the next an interior logic drives Cataleyas impossible maneuvers. ""You dont have to understand"" her father says shortly before his execution giving her instructions that allow her to escape the country. ""You just have to listen."" His advice extends to viewers With each proceeding cut theres no time to pause and comprehend whether Cataleyas gravity-defying antics and apparent invincibility add up. Like so many action movies ""Colombiana"" offers up a premeditated plea to just go with it. This kind of chaos comes with a plan. And thats exactly what Storks analysis maps out. In essence the conversation about ""chaos cinema"" (which has since the publication of Storks essay continued in other lengthy riffs and extensive blog comment threads) focuses on moving pictures as a ride. In ""Colombiana"" which opens this weekend and thus provides the handiest example the initial exposition during Cataleyas violent childhood functions like the early undulations of a roller coaster. When the story jumps forward 15 years it prepares for the big drop. Still on the hunt for the druglord who ordered the hit on her folks Cataleya keeps churning along. The character is first seen using her feminine prowess (a skill that even the very modern very versatile Jason Bourne cant muster) to con her way into a prison and knock off one of her targets main men. Even as the body count rises it cant match the number of hits Cataleya has piled up before the contemporary scenes of the film even begin. It turns out she started her hunt long ago and never missed a shot. The presumption that this sleek femme fatale in her late 20s could knock off 22 men while evading capture already elevates her to a level of fantasy that audiences easily take for granted. ""You wont see her until its too late"" a detective warns his team. ""Shes that invisible."" As opposed to partly invisible of course. But you know the drill Shoot first ask question later. Or in this case dont bother asking questions. This automatic suspension of disbelief excuses the kind of spatial discontinuity that Stork discusses in detail. ""Rapid editing close framings bipolar lens lengths and promiscuous camera movement now define commercial filmmaking"" he says in the video. ""The result is a film style marked by excess exaggeration and overindulgence Chaos cinema."" Its a format that runs in opposition to the clean uniform editing strategies that can never be mentioned without paying heed to scholar David Bordwell who coined the term ""classical Hollywood cinema."" On this front Storks argument has stable footing. However I worry that the ""chaos cinema"" moniker risks implying that all perspective disorientation lacks aesthetic merit. On the contrary Fast and furious filmmaking necessitates control over the material in question. When a director relaxes that control a movie can understandably fall apart but the best contemporary action movies know exactly when they want their rhyme and reason to crumble. An ideal example is ""Shoot Em Up"" Michael Davis sorely underrated 2007 Clive Owen vehicle and a movie that Stork includes (without additional comment) as one of the clips in his collage of modern chaos cinema. This is a movie that knows the boundaries of the action genre and shrewdly pushes them to their wildest extremes. In the opening sequence Owen impales a baddie with... a carrot. That absurd maneuver is not unlike Jason Stathams ability to juice himself by constantly pumping his chest with a defibrillator in the phenomenal Neveldine/Taylor cult hit ""Crank"" or the stars of recent reboot ""The A-Team"" figuring out how to fly a tank as it falls from a plane. These are the rightful inheritors of the action cinema mantle. Purposefully erratic they either deconstruct diminished expectations or subvert them. Of course great movies are in the minority at the multiplex. Breaking no new ground ""Colombiana"" more or less plays it straight. Energetically directed by Olivier Megaton the new movie is economically paced but fairly uninspired. Within its first minutes Cataleyas ill-fated dad says ""we have an hour"" and begins dashing through downtown Bogota to evade his assailants. (Seemingly moments later he clarifies ""We have 10 minutes."") Unremarkable action movies like ""Colombiana"" didnt come out of nowhere. To understand their genesis look no further than the film class that is Quentin Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" opus. The synthesis of parts one and two set at various points in Hong Kong and somewhere in the Midwest create a vivid statement of the modern state of action cinema. In short Tarantino displays its DNA -- a hybrid of eastern cinema (primarily martial arts films) and the grimy virile atmosphere of the postmodern western. These dual traditions embolden the action genre much in the same way that innumerable thoughtless counterexamples the paragon being ""Transformers"" drag it down. Yet the dialogue about ""chaos cinema"" doesnt engage with issues of provenance. As a result it turns action movies into an easy target since the conversation entirely revolves around the how not the why. Like anything else solid action movies need a reason to exist. Sometimes understanding that reason requires a conversation not exclusively related to formalism. Themes desires and implied argumentation allow cinema to become a window into the way the world works -- and sometimes as with the liveliest spectacles to provide an escape from it. That doesnt come with a guarantee of ingenuity. As an example consider the single line repeated like a mantra throughout the trailer for ""Colombiana"" that lays bare its purpose. ""Never forget where you came from"" whispers Cataleyas father a statement that eternally echoes in her head. Like the character the movie never forgets its roots doggedly adhering to formula in a way that underscores chaos cinema at its most banal Utter predictability.

Luc Besson keeps ralphing up scripts about beautiful lady killers but that doesnt mean you have to keep seeing them. Case in point ""Colombiana."" Besson (""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Professional"") co-wrote this dull cable-TV-quality item. A sluggish prologue that takes three times as long as it should establishes the back story of Cataleya a little girl in Bogota who thirsts for revenge after her assassin father is killed by his own bosses and shes obliged to flee for her life. As an adult Cataleya (Zoe Saldana of ""Avatar"") winds up in Chicago with her uncle. The slender story line of her going after her dads killers then sits cold on the back burner for most of the movie. She becomes a killer for hire with a specialty in eliminating such sleazebags as a Jabba the Hutt-like villain who keeps his pet sharks in a large tank under the floor. The action scenes though ridiculous and building up to a grand finale in which Cataleya beats a guy senseless with a hand towel and then stabs him with a toothbrush arent as painful as the clunky ""romantic"" interludes. And she turns reprehensible even for a hit woman when she threatens to kill an FBI agent unless he puts her in touch with a CIA man who knows the address of her fathers former gangster boss. But for those who enjoy the prospect of watching Saldana slink around in her undies wielding a rifle roughly the size of a kayak this is the film for you.

(Magali Bragard/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 26 2011 400 AM Title Colombiana An assassin goes after her parents killers. With Zoe Saldana Michael Vartan. Director Olivier Megaton (147). PG-13 violence sexuality language.Zoe Saldana makes being an action hero look so easy in ""Colombiana"" you have to wonder why more actresses dont try it.Granted they may not be given the opportunity. But Saldanas success could kick open a few doors-or they might just fall off in a spray of Uzi bullets.Either entrance works for her single-minded character Cataleya. After watching a Colombian drug dealer kill her parents a nine-year-old Cataleya (Amandla Stenberg) escapes to her uncles home in Chicago and declares her unwavering intention to seek revenge.Fifteen years later her life plan is right on target. Shes a paid assassin killing bad guys that take her closer to her true goal to find her parents murderer and make him pay. All thats standing in her way is a dogged FBI agent (Lennie James) and a suspicious boyfriend (Michael Vartan) determined to find out more about her.Director Olivier Megaton is as unsubtle as his name suggests and cowriter/producer Luc Besson (""La Femme Nikita"") is hardly known for his delicate touch.But they keep us on edge with pacing that rarely lets up staging several suspenseful set pieces for their game lead. Saldana swims through shark tanks crawls around air ducts explodes massive swaths of real estate and carries guns that may weigh more than she does. And she does it all with conviction just as much any antisocial hero you might find in an Eighties action flick. Plus shes got the acting skills to handle the emotional scenes without embarrassing anyone.She also has to overcome a few additional hurdles somehow Jason Stathams duties never require him to suck on lollipops and dance around an apartment in his undies after checking his gun stash.But this is B-movie territory and that means taking the eye-rolling moments along with the heart-pounding ones. Saldana keeps the balance tipped in the right direction; the strongest weapon in her arsenal is an unwavering confidence that blasts through every obstacle no matter how inane.Magic Moment Cataleya is just as good at breaking into a prison cell as she is at sneaking out of one.

Starring Zoe Saldana Michael Vartan Max Martini Jordi Molla Lennie James Sam Douglas Stephen Martines Doug Rao Charles Maquignon Beto Benites Director Olivier Megaton Running time 145 Release Opened Aug 26 2011  Editorial Review La Femme ColombianaBy Mark JenkinsFriday Aug 26 2011After spending the past decade synthesizing a hyper-macho hybrid of the French policier the Hong Kong kung fu movie and the British gangster actioncomedy Luc Besson has decided to make one for the girls. The protagonist of ""Colombiana"" is a young woman who has strong feelings for her parents a warm relationship with her boyfriend and a proclivity for sketching the delicate Colombian orchid for which shes named. Of course her parents are dead her boyfriend is at great risk and she draws the flower in black lipstick on the bodies of her victims. Yes Cataleya (like the heroine of the writer producer and sometime directors ""La Femme Nikita"") is an assassin. And yes (like the heroine of Bessons ""The Professional"") she has vowed revenge on the drug dealers who killed her folks. But despite a list of hits thats topped 20 the killer - played by ""Avatars"" Zoe Saldana - is a sensitive sometimes weepy soul. And ""Colombiana"" at least by comparison with such Besson franchises as the ""Transporter"" series has a gentle touch. Thats not immediately obvious. The opening credits offer a stutter-edit view of Bogota intercut with documentary footage of drug-cartel infamies. That is followed by a sequence in which the 9-year-olds parents are killed by narco gang lord Don Luis (Beto Benites) and his enforcer Marco (Jordi Molla). But the girl (Amandla Stenberg) escapes over rooftops and through sewers. It turns out shes skilled at parkour the urban obstacle-course sport featured in many Besson productions. The grimly self-possessed Cataleya makes an improbably brisk passage from Bogota to Chicago where she easily finds her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis). Hes a brute but a tender one. He agrees to teach her how to be a professional killer under one condition She has to go to school. She probably attends a Catholic one but despite frequent choruses of ""Ave Maria"" Cataleya could hardly be mistaken for another of Bessons action heroines Joan of Arc. Cut to 15 years later and Cataleya has become a master assassin which involves expert planning some acting skills and an ability to improvise weapons. (The movie has plenty of guns but also inventive use of a spoon and a toothbrush.) Every homicide hit she commits is an advertisement for her campaign to annihilate Don Luis and Marco whove been relocated by the CIA for no apparent reason to New Orleans. (For all its globalized touches this is Bessons most American effort.) The movies first killing of Cataleyas parents happens off-camera which sets the tone for this almost ladylike hit-woman flick. Besson and his collaborators - who include director Olivier Megaton and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen - devise some gruesome deaths for the assassins targets (all of whom its established are bad bad people). These demises however are suggested rather than shown. The final showdown with Don Luis and his henchmen is frantic and explosive its quick cuts made even woozier by strobe effects. Yet the action sequences in the movies middle section are cool and methodical more ""Mission Impossible"" than ""Pulp Fiction."" Saldana was blue-skinned and literally coltish as ""Avatars"" CGI-enhanced eco-champion. Here shes catlike and curt with about as many lines as Bessons B-movie factory normally allots to someone like Jason Statham or Jet Li. That allows for a few modestly amusing twists on movie stereotypes. Cataleya is using her artist boyfriend (Michael Vartan) for sex but in one scene he insists she talk about her family and her feelings much to her discomfort. ""Colombiana"" though doesnt quite qualify as a chick flick. The filmmakers were surely thinking of the guys when they arranged for Saldana to play many of her scenes in a cat suit a bikini or lingerie. When her hideaway is raided by a police SWAT team Cataleya must escape in her white cotton scanties. In one sense however shes always prepared Shes never taken by surprise while wearing undies that dont match.Contains violence sexual situations and profanity.

But unlike most assassins she occasionally elicits our sympathy thanks to the back story that focuses on her childhood trauma.There are some stock action sequences as well as captivating chases particularly an early one involving Saldanas character Cataleya as a 10-year-old played by Amandla Stenberg. The wide-eyed girl is pursued by a posse of Colombian thugs around the mean streets of Bogota. Wearing a loose-fitting schoolgirl uniform the innocent-looking Cataleya leaps off roofs and slides down walls with the skill of a ninja evading the villains who killed her mother and father.VIDEO Preview ColombianaShe cleverly escapes to the USA and goes to live in Chicago with her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) who delivers his lines with dark humor. For example when young Cataleya earnestly tells him she once wanted to be Xena the warrior princess when she grows up but has decided instead to be a killer he responds with simple acquiescence. Without batting an eye he agrees to be her teacher in the nefarious ways of assassination.Still he urges her to go to middle school so she wont be an uneducated murderer.About the movieColombiana   1/2 out of fourStars Zoe Saldana Cliff Curtis Michael Vartan Jordi Molla Beto BenitesDirector Olivier MegatonDistributor TriStar Pictures RatingPG-13 for violence disturbing images intense sequences of action sexuality and brief strong language.Running time1 hour 47 minutes Opens Friday nationwideObviously the film calls for suspension of disbelief.Its all about retribution and vengeance for Cataleya. She makes her living as a hired gun but tracks the movements of the men who killed her parents and takes them down one by one. Her overriding goal is to kill the mobster (Beto Benites) who ordered the murders. Saldana is in top form for the acrobatics required in the role and she makes the gritty determination of her character believable.A long tense exciting scene in which she gets herself arrested in order to execute an intricate hit on a prisoner is a highlight and it makes up for some generic sequences.Her romantic scenes with boyfriend Danny (Michael Vartan) who has no clue what she does for a living help to humanize her.An unexpected bonus Audiences get a cursory horticultural lesson. Cataleya (also known as cattleya) is a kind of orchid native to South America and known for its showy flowers. (After a kill the character signs her victims with a lipstick drawing of her floral namesake.)This is a showy flower of an action film. Saldana doesnt get much of a chance to emote but her action skills blossom. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Credit Magali Bragard/Columbia Pictures Refusing to believe what the evidence is telling him the F.B.I. agent chasing the implacable killer in ""Colombiana"" snarls ""Were not looking for a woman. Its not possible.""Apparently he hasnt been watching enough Luc Besson movies. The director of this potboiler revenge fantasy may be Olivier Megaton (a great action-director name even if it is pronounced may-gah-TONE). But the guiding spirit is clearly that of Mr. Besson a writer and producer of the film who can claim to have created and continually perfected the lethal-woman-in-her-underwear genre to which ""Colombiana"" belongs.Mr. Bessons previous avenging waifs have included Anne Parillaud (in the foundational ""Femme Nikita"") a very young Natalie Portman (""The Professional"") and an orange-haired Milla Jovovich (""The Fifth Element""). His latest muse is Zoe Saldana the blue-skinned heroine of ""Avatar"" who proves to be equally adept at the essential skill of wielding large guns while wearing skimpy clothing. (Well maybe not as adept as Ms. Jovovich who seems to have been genetically engineered for this kind of thing.)Whats not required is the creation of an actual character; the best an actress can hope for is to look good and if the director and screenwriter cooperate maintain her dignity and sense of humor. Ms. Saldana playing an almost supernaturally skilled hit woman and parkour enthusiast whose larger mission is to avenge the murder of her Colombian drug-dealing parents has to work hard in that regard.Thats because ""Colombiana"" isnt content to be a comic-book joyride (though it is that); it has pretensions to a more turgid class of revenge melodrama along the lines of Tony Scotts ""Man on Fire."" It also has pretensions period Mr. Megaton sprinkles in homages to Francis Ford Coppola (Ms. Saldanas rising out of the water like Martin Sheen in ""Apocalypse Now"") and Brian De Palma (the climactic sequence at a drug lords lair is redolent of ""Scarface""). The overall effect is distancing; there are some early comic moments that have you laughing along with the movie but eventually the clashing tones and preposterousness just have you laughing.Ms. Saldana has one other thing to overcome the presence of a wide-eyed 13-year-old actress named Amandla Stenberg who plays the protagonist Cataleya Restrepo at the time her parents are gunned down in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Her portrayal of the future deadly-but-sensitive killer is such a perfect combination of trembling emotion action chops and deadpan humor that Ms. Saldana no matter how sexily professional her work is spends the rest of the movie failing to live up to it.""Colombiana"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Guns missiles torture sharks.COLOMBIANAOpens on Friday nationwide.

"Colombiana Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Zoe SaldanaMovie review ColombianaZoe Saldana is a lean mean killing machine in this fun revenge thriller.August 26 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Zoe Saldana as ""Cataleya"" in ""Colombiana."" (Columbia Pictures )When a director dubs himself Megaton whatever the esoteric allusion and even if hes French you dont expect subtlety. And subtlety is definitely not what you will get with ""Colombiana"" the hyperactive action-thriller/fashion-week catwalk starring sleek Zoe Saldana as the latest trend in lethal weapons. Is Saldana the new Schwarzenegger only leaner meaner and much better looking in spandex? I think so. This B-movie blast of bloody blam blam is the latest chapter in the Luc Besson book of badly bruised lovelies who are better not crossed. What he began in 1990 with ""La Femme Nikita"" followed with ""LA(c)on"" in 94 and 97s ""The Fifth Element"" (the last written with Robert Mark Kamen who co-wrote ""Colombiana"" with the B-man) he refines in ""Colombiana."" Meanwhile former graffiti artist Olivier Megaton who in recent years has come under the Besson umbrella directing the very fast-moving train of 2008s ""Transporter 3"" seems to have hit his stride in this latest excursion into magazine spread murder. It helps that Saldana has the body of a model and a fierceness of acting focus; it all combines to make the slick intense aesthetic work. The killing begins in Bogota when Cataleya (Saldana) is just a 10-year-old schoolgirl doing homework at the kitchen table when thugs sent by the local drug lord gun down her parents in front of her. That sets up the reason for revenge but even better an excuse to stage an exceptionally fine opening chase scene that showcases the beauty danger and athleticism of parkour as the young Cataleya (Amandla Stenberg) races rolls and bounds over around and through tightly stacked hillside houses and serpentine alleyways to escape the killers. Her passport to safety a Chicago and her uncle a a microchip she swallows then expels all over the desk of a very disgruntled embassy official. Its in the Besson tradition to give the main character a trauma that both changes and defines the life that follows. It certainly does for Cataleya. On her first day of school in Chicago she tells Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) that the only thing she wants to learn is how to become a killer. In a sort of twisted back-to-school-special moment Uncle E proceeds to explain in somewhat explosive terms that what she really needs is a good education if she truly wants to become a good killer. Who knew? Though we dont see Cataleya grow up we can guess that she must have been an A student because the next time we see her shes pulling off a smartly sophisticated killing that involves being clad in a body suit and executing a series of contortions in tight spaces that would make Houdini jealous. It comes as no surprise that her targets are all tied to the crew who killed her parents. Whether its a nod to the directors artistic leanings the image of the orchid shes named for a (cattleya for the horticulturist purists out there) a becomes her signature inked onto the bodies of her victims. It helps knit the plot together with the pattern attracting the attention of a persistent FBI agent played by Lennie James the Colombian drug lord Don Luis (Beto Benites) his No. 2 Marco (Jordi MollA ) and the sleazy CIA agent (Callum Blue) who helped relocate Don Luis and his cronies under some kind of off-the-books witness protection scam to New Orleans. Since this is also a love story there is a hunk for Cataleya to get naked with a position nicely filled by Michael Vartan as Danny. Hes an artist who doesnt ask a lot of questions a good thing considering her messy obsession. The killings prove to be a piece of cake compared to the complications of love and the movie does a pretty good job of bobbing and weaving between the two with Saldana bringing as much verve and emotion to the assignations as to the assassinations. But the filmmakers never forget their main agenda is action and elimination piling up the bodies in increasingly exotic and unbelievably complex ways all very cleverly and cleanly shot by director of photography Romain Lacourbas who worked with Megaton on ""Transporter 3."" Keeping the style at Maxim levels is production designer Patrick Durand with costume designer Olivier BA(c)riot making the most of the sartorial possibilities afforded by Saldanas lean leggy frame All of that combines to make ""Colombiana"" into a scandalous blend of action sex and violence.

Co-writer and co-producer Luc Besson tries a new spin on his tried-and-true ""La Femme Nikita"" formula but the results are so clumsy and over-the-top that they should have just called the movie ""Panty Assassin"" and played the whole thing for laughs. Because laughter is the only way to respond to material this ridiculous. We first meet Saldanas lethal Cataleya as a young girl (played by Amandla Stenberg) who sees her parents slaughtered in front of her at the command of evil drug kingpin Don Luis (Beto Benites). She escapes Colombia and comes to Chicago where shes taken in by her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) -- the vengeance-obsessed Cataleya wants to learn how to be a killer but Emilio insists she go to school first. Emilio makes his point in this argument mind you by firing several rounds into a moving car and causing it to crash. In broad daylight. In front of dozens of witnesses. But after Cataleya understands that she needs to know how the world works before she shoots everyone in it they walk home ignored by those same witnesses and by the cops who arrive on the scene. This comes after the part where the young girl somehow becomes a ninja who can outrun a team of killers in the slums of Bogota. And after she gives someone in the U.S. embassy a microchip that her father gave her loaded with screens of numbers that are never explained but are apparently very important. Of course this is a movie where none of the filmmakers seem to understand how computers or newspapers work but Im getting ahead of myself. We skip forward 15 years and the grown-up Cataleya is a brilliant hired assassin even though most of her kills and her escapes rely rather heavily on lucky guesses. She draws the rare cataleya orchid on her victims chests in the hopes of sending a message to Don Luis and its only after 22 murders that the FBI starts publicizing this fact. (The feds arent presented as the sharpest knives in the drawer -- when looking at a pool of possible killers which includes Cataleya Special Agent Ross (Lennie James) bellows ""Were not looking for a woman It isnt possible"") And then theres the Chicago precinct cop with the French accent and the CIA agent with a British accent and the overbearingly obvious score by Nathaniel Mechaly and the hand-to-hand combat sequence that somehow combines jittery editing and toothbrushes as weapons. Not to mention those fakey-looking newspapers seemingly printed on fax paper with European punctuation marks; they would have been laughed off the set of an Ed Wood movie. If youre starved for giggles in this late-summer season you could do worse than the supremely silly ""Colombiana."" Saldanas supporting turns in ""Avatar"" and ""Star Trek"" suggest that shes a female action star in the making but not in a movie this ludicrous. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The Olivier Megaton-directed ""Colombiana"" may not be the brainiest of actioners but one of the merits of producer Luc Bessons latest brainchild is that fanboys worldwide will come away with a scrap of horticultural knowledge as well as a pretty good time. Sexy vengeful contract killer Cataleya (a feline Zoe Saldana) is named after a Colombian orchid species signing her victims with a lipstick drawing of her floral namesake. Solidly produced if slightly generic English-language pic should do midrange biz in France where it bowed July 27 and OK numbers Stateside where it goes out Aug. 26. Rather than adopting a tired flashback-heavy approach Megaton and screenwriters Besson and regular collaborator Robert Mark Kamen let Cataleyas childhood trauma play out upfront in an audacious half-hour prologue set in 1992 Bogota. Still a little girl Cataleya (Amandla Stenberg) witnesses the assassination of her next of kin by crime boss Don Luis (Beto Benites) and his vicious right-hand man Marco (Jordi Molla). Cataleya decides she wants to become a killer when she grows up so she can properly exact revenge on Luis Marco and their gang. Fifteen years later played by Saldana shes a pretty -- and pretty impressive -- contract killer working for her Chicago-based uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis). The first assignment auds get to see her in is an elaborately staged hit inside a prison an intricately staged and executed 10-minute-plus setpiece that reps one of the pics two action highlights. The second is a mano-a-mano fight in a hacienda bathroom an intentionally messier sequence that injects a welcome dose of reality and real danger into the proceedings -- something lacking in the films more bombastic and generic shootouts and explosions. Much of the viewers investment will depend on his or her concern for Cataleyas plight and this is where Saldanas contribution is key. Despite being a ruthless killer with a killer bod and a predilection for skimpy tight-fitting apparel (costume designer Olivier Beriot seems to have taken a cue from the ""Avatar"" thesps motion-capture body suit) she not only exudes sexiness but also generates a certain amount of sympathy. Saldanas handful of scenes with her artist b.f. (Michael Vartan) who has no clue what she does for a living help humanize the otherwise solitary killing machine. And three tense confrontations -- in a schoolyard and a library with Emilio and during a home visit with the FBI agent on her tail (Lennie James) -- nicely juxtapose plotting and characterization between action setups. Like all action pics from Bessons EuropaCorp including helmer Megatons ""The Transporter 3"" ""Colombiana"" is slickly assembled. Locations including Mexico the U.S. and France and Patrick Durands production design are expertly showcased in Romain Lacourbas sun-dappled widescreen lensing; editing and score are unobtrusive. The work of stunt coordinator Michel Julienne (""Taken"" the ""Transporter"" films) and fight choreographer Alain Figlarz (""The Bourne Identity"" ""Largo Winch"") is pro but has a greatest-hits feel rather than its own identity.
