ROBERT SIEGEL host From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Im Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS host And Im Michele Norris. This fall has been a boom time for movie biographies. Hollywood has profiled writer Truman Capote broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and rapper 50 Cent. And today brings a look at country music legend Johnny Cash. Bob Mondello says ""Walk the Line"" walks a pretty straight line but it should please Cashs fans. BOB MONDELLO reporting The Man in Black abused pills and liquor and sang in a deep baritone about the outlaw life but thats not who we meet at first. The film introduces little Johnny Cash grieving for an older brother joining the Air Force to get away from a hard-hearted dad marrying his school sweetheart and auditioning at Sun Records with a gospel tune. Hes a nice kid and when he gets a singing tour with some other kids named Elvis and Jerry Lee and chats up a former child star named June Carter hes shyness itself. (Soundbite of ""Walk the Line"") Mr. JOAQUIN PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) Me and my brother Jack we always listened to your songs. Like ""Swallerin Place."" Ms. REESE WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Yeah. Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) Yeah. We liked it when youd sing one alone. Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Well you and Jack are the only ones. Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) What do you mean? Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Im not really much of a singer Johnny. A lot of personality. I got sass. I give it my all. But my sister Anitas really the one whos got the pipes. MONDELLO A friendship develops but because theyre both married nothing becomes of it for a while. Then June gets a divorce and things heat up a bit though Johnny has to do his wooing on stage because June wont hear of it backstage. (Soundbite of ""Walk the Line"") Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Hi folks. How you all doing again? I hope you all dont mind my bare feet. So what are we gonna sing Johnny? You got me out here. Is that what your plan is? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) Well I always liked that song of yours ""Times A-Wastin."" Lets do ""Times A-Wastin."" (Soundbite of applause) Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Jack I am not gonna sing that song. Its inappropriate. I recorded it with my ex-husband. Im not gonna sing it. Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) There wasnt a better way to put it behind you. Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) Im not going to do it. Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) June just sing it. (Soundbite of music) Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash; singing) Well Ive got arms. Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter; singing) And Ive got arms. Mr. PHOENIX and Ms. WITHERSPOON (As Johnny Cash and June Carter; singing in unison) Lets get together and use those arms. Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter; singing) Lets go. Mr. PHOENIX and Ms. WITHERSPOON (As Johnny Cash and June Carter; singing in unison) Times a-wastin. MONDELLO Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are doing their own singing and its plenty persuasive if not always a precise match for the real Cash and Carter. What the actors do nail is the emotional chemistry of a high-profile couple who for the longest time could really only be alone together when they were on stage. They seem to blossom under the lights and watching that the emotional connection is more compelling than the fact that the actors have captured the singers body language Witherspoon stamping her foot so hard it makes that mane of dark hair quiver; Phoenix hitching his guitar way up into his armpit like Cash did and twisting in toward the mike as if hes going to swallow it. Offstage they are less animated having to deal with the downtimes as Cash gets hooked on amphetamines. (Soundbite of ""Walk the Line"") Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) Wheres my pills? Ms. WITHERSPOON (As June Carter) ...(Unintelligible). Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) Juney. Juney dont say that. Now hold on hon. I need those. MONDELLO The film doesnt really suggest that Cash and Carter were any different from other musicians whove ridden stardom through a substance abuse flameout. Youd think thered be more edge to country musics biggest outlaw but maybe not when hes in love and with director James Mangold pushing that side of the story. ""Walk the Line"" never crosses the line in the places it might. The film works but in a conventional way as a standard showbiz saga with Cashs outlaw quality starting out as this huge obstacle but ending up seeming little more than smart commercial music packaging. Going to Folsom Prison for his comeback--what a great career move. Fortunately the scene knocks your socks off. Im Bob Mondello. (Soundbite of ""Walk the Line"") Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash) This songs for your warden. (Soundbite of music) Mr. PHOENIX (As Johnny Cash; singing) Early one morning while making the rounds I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down. I went right home and I went to bed and put that loving .44... Copyright (c) 2005 NPR. All rights reserved.

Refreshing because Mangold roots firmly in live performance the story of Cashs quick rise to fame struggle with addiction and long-stalled union with his touring partner Carter (Witherspoon). Phoenix rises above conventional - though always sober - biographical plotting (a story of love and redemption driven by the care of a good woman) brilliantly handling most of the singing himself and delivering more than a good impression of the Man in Black.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do their own singing as country stars Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. 20th Century Fox Star Joaquin Phoenix lets it all go in his breakout scene re-creating Get Rhythm one of the country titans signature tunes at Sun Records. Its an exhilarating moment. We may have had 30 years of an effects-driven film culture but what real movie lovers crave are acting stretches and showmanship that truly surprise. Seeing Phoenix you want to call 15 friends and say ""Get ready."" It really is the Gladiator guy singing with voice demeanor eyelids and chin combining for a dead-on Cash package. Co-star Reese Witherspoon is equally perfect as singer onstage partner and eventual wife June Carter. Both stars will likely be propelled into the Oscar race the way Jamie Foxx was last year for Ray. About the movie Walk the Line    1/2 (out of four) Stars Joaquin Phoenix Reese Witherspoon Ginnifer Goodwin Robert Patrick Dallas Roberts Shelby Lynne Director James Mangold Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for some language thematic material and depiction of drug dependency Running time 2 hours 18 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Walk the Line builds up to the famous Folsom Prison concert in 1968 but Cashs story is motivated by lamentable memories of his Arkansas childhood. Cashs daddy (well played by Terminator 2s Robert Patrick) is a tough case whether drinking or teetotaling. And Cashs older brother his fathers favorite dies young in a power-saw accident. These formative episodes are economically sketched setting up marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) whom some Cash family members reportedly are unhappy to see portrayed as a nag. As shown here she had her reasons. Heres Cash on the road drinking popping pills watching Jerry Lee Lewis from the wings and later ogling Mother Maybelle Carters cute daughter. All while Viv is at home cleaning up kid slobber. Line thus becomes the story of married Johnny divorced mom June and a love that had to stay hidden except during flirty fun on stage. Playing a leveling influence whos giddy during performances Witherspoon has dark hair some of her Legally Blonde pluck and more vulnerable charm than she has ever shown. Individually together off-stage and especially on this is smash casting one of the best romantic pairings ever. The incalculable bonus is not just having the leads do their own singing but doing it convincingly which is how Gary Busey reaped critical raves and then an Oscar nomination in 1978 for The Buddy Holly Story. Its a magical but eerie time warp watching Phoenix and Witherspoon duet on Jackson and its convincingly scary when Phoenixs Cash suffers a disastrous concert after an amphetamine binge. When the story slows down a bit or when A Boy Named Sue turns out to be absent its OK because weve already been won over. Walk the Line combusts white heat from star power.

He could be a backwoods minister warning of the Apocalypse in an Old Testament voice or Satan himself smiling sourly at the worlds capacity for hurting itself. Whether he was both of these characters or neither Cash brought the outlaw presence to pop music. The authenticity in his quavering baritone attested to a life of bitter experience. In those ballads of hard traveling careless love and felonious assault the words he sang were places hed been got hurt in and learned from. That startling line in Folsom Prison Blues -- I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die -- is followed by When I hear that whistle blowin I hang my head and cry. First the bad-man boast then the sinners remorse. And finally the born-again vindication. James Mangolds mostly excellent Walk the Line is designed as a Christian epic. In this particular it diverges from last years exemplary musical bio-pic Ray which depicted Ray Charles as a roiling spirit who conquered his demons on his own. This movies Johnny Cash -- in a scary-good turn by Joaquin Phoenix -- is a haunted man who is redeemed by a good woman June Carter. The young Cash was such a huge and instructively troubled figure that in any movie about him other characters are inevitably supporting. Thats the case with Walk the Line even though it means to trace the growing love story that snuck up on him and June Carter princess of the singing Carter Family. Carter was Cashs polar opposite sun to his shadow a pixie to his wraith as chatty as he was withdrawn a natural comic at home in the limelight -- whereas he seemed to have been dragged on stage to testify to the crimes and heartbreaks in his songs. (As she well knew having co-written Ring of Fire for Cash.) Reese Witherspoon captures Carters raised-in-showbiz canniness and with it a womans no-nonsense resolve to get her man suited up for salvation. Witherspoon has been pinwheeling this spunky charm for ages. Phoenixs triumph is even more substantial. Though his singing voice (he and Witherspoon do their own vocals) cant approach Cash in its lonesome depths he has the gift of finding a home in this troubled mind of moving in and living there. When he stands before an audience unleashes the dread Cash stare and holds his guitar like a machine gun you wonder if hes going to open fire on the crowd or himself. If Witherspoon has the gift of residing in her character of moving in and living there Phoenix seems voluntarily consigned to the Folsom Prison of Johnnys darkness. A lot of credit for Phoenixs performance has to go to Mangold who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls Pruitt Taylor Vinces short-order cook in Heavy Sly Stallones tired sheriff in Cop Land. If Mangolds new movie has a problem its that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously. Johns father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) is a one-note ogre who blames John for surviving his more adored younger brother and whose condemnation of the singer lasts way longer than is dramatically necessary. Johns first wife Vivien (Ginnifer Goodwin) -- a wonderful lady who went through a lot of hell with him in the recollection of Cashs buddy and fellow Country Music Hall of Famer George Jones -- is reduced to a small-minded sort with selfish middle-class dreams. My mom was basically a nonentity in the entire film except for the mad little psycho who hated his career Vivien and Johns daughter Kathy Cash told AP this week. Thats not true. She loved his career and was proud of him until he started taking drugs and stopped coming home. The screenwriters probably didnt mean to demean her; they just needed to show a failed marriage before the perfect one comes along. The rules of movie romance forbid a hero from having two true loves. But the subsidiary conventions finally dont matter. This is a solo dirge that becomes a love-song duet. And as such its as down-home and true as the image of John and June singing their hearts out for their fans and themselves -- a destiny to which she was born and he was fated.

All Rights Reserved. Not for sale or duplication. Photo . Their love raged in a ring of fire -- Johnny Cash and June Carter held on in good times and bad 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Walk the Line Drama. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 136 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When Joaquin Phoenix opens his mouth to sing for the first time in ""Walk the Line"" director James Mangolds film about the first half of Johnny Cash s life its as disappointing as seeing a brunette cast as Marilyn Monroe . Phoenix has neither Cashs voice nor a compelling one of his own. Hes not as tall as Cash; his face isnt worn and he doesnt have that look in his eyes. We all know the one sad and wise but unpredictable part Abe Lincoln and part honky-tonk wild man. There was only one Johnny Cash. Thats all were ever going to get. Yet once that disappointment is observed and registered its possible to appreciate ""Walk the Line"" for the substantial thing it is a passionate warts-and-all chronicle of an extraordinary American artist not to mention a love story that cant be beat. Phoenix isnt Cash but he clearly made a study of Cashs stage manner and when hes not singing its possible to pretend. Whats more the movie provides a showcase for one of the years great performances Reese Witherspoon as June Carter the woman who became Cashs second wife. With Witherspoon theres no need for pretending. A whole review could be eaten up talking about whats great about Witherspoon in ""Walk the Line."" At the very least a few points must be made Just technically shes astonishing. She sounds uncannily like Carter. She sings just like her in terms of style and when she stands in front of a microphone she suggests the ease of someone who has appeared onstage since childhood. Somehow Witherspoon conveys that backstory of a life spent in the business. Its there in the gracious way she handles (and gets rid of) fans and in the unfazed and professional way she depicts a woman going about her job. But she does much more. From the beginning when Cash first meets June backstage on his first tour he responds to her fearless energy and forthright intelligence. Because of the intensity of his gaze of his fascination for her its only natural that the audience should become fascinated too. But Witherspoon doesnt coast on this and we soon become even more aware of how shes looking at him. Its a complicated look one that makes it completely understandable why Cash felt he had to marry her She sees through him. She knows hes a mess. She knows hes special. She sees how he might fall apart and how he might blossom into greatness. And shes tracking his progress in each direction. For her Cash is an iffy proposition but for Cash the choice is obvious Either he marries her or resigns himself to going through life without anyone fully knowing him. All this we get from Witherspoon. The movie shows the uphill nature of Cashs climb. His childhood in Arkansas is hardscrabble and grim. Through his sympathetic and musical mother he learns gospel songs but his father (Robert Patrick) a malevolent hick verbally abuses him. In the Army he learns to play guitar and writes some songs but life as a musician is a far-off dream until he auditions one day for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records. The audition scene is strong -- Phillips shames Cash into doing his best -- but its undercut by Phoenixs shaky singing. The film presents the life of a touring musician as exhilarating but hardly glamorous; a succession of cheap motels and long drives through the night. When Cash returns home to his first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) shes not interested in hearing about life on the road and even announces her ""new rule"" that hes not allowed to talk about it. The movie does a hatchet job on the first wife who among other crimes is so clueless that she tells Johnny not to wear black. Johnnys growing dependence on prescription drugs the expansion of his career and his continued interest in June become the story of ""Walk the Line."" Maybe it didnt really happen this way -- maybe its just shrewd screenwriting on the part of Mangold and Gill Dennis -- but they shape these elements into a cohesive narrative by making everything a subset of Johnnys attraction to June He writes songs about June so his career expands. He cant get June -- hes married shes married -- and so he turns to drugs. The one thing the movie gives too little attention to is the obstacle presented by their religious faith. Perhaps the filmmakers didnt want to alienate a secular audience but Cash and Carters Christianity had everything to do with the slow way they got together and plenty to do with their bond once married. (It also had a lot to do with his outreach to prisoners.) When Carter wrote ""Ring of Fire"" about the lust she felt for Cash she didnt pull that metaphor out of thin air. Still ""Walk the Line"" is worthy of its subjects and thats saying a lot. -- Advisory This film contains drug use and sexual situations.

RELATED  Finding the voice spirit of Johnny Cash YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review June Carter Cash Johnny Cash or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Hollywood loves biographical films and movies about country music stars are almost a genre within that genre from ""Coal Miners Daughter"" (Sissy Spacek gives an Oscar-winning performance as Loretta Lynn) to ""Great Balls of Fire"" featuring Dennis Quaids sweat-drenched performance) to ""Sweet Dreams"" (the fine Jessica Lange as Patsy Cline).It makes a lot of sense Country music by its nature features themes of heartache survival and love lost and won and the musicians -- who usually suffered all the above -- make for great drama.Now with ""Walk the Line"" the life of Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter Cash has been put under the microscope. Their story and the film does not disappoint.The late June Carter Cash -- she died in May 2003 and a heartbroken Johnny followed her just five months later -- said her husband had two personalities Cash the wild dark man and John the honest and vulnerable man. He was a boy whose father blamed him for his brothers tragic death and a man who battled fierce demons.Thanks to Joaquin Phoenixs terrific performance ""Walk The Line"" captures this dual persona brilliantly. Phoenix -- who had never even played guitar before getting this role -- doesnt imitate Cash. He just gets Cash in ways great and small. When he steps up to the microphone and says ""Hello Im Johnny Cash"" you believe him. This performance will undoubtedly win him an Oscar nomination.The same can be said for Reese Witherspoon who plays June. Director James Mangold made a bold move in casting the petite blonde actress mainly known for lightweight comedy and she delivers.June Carter Cashs profile was much lower than her husbands so Witherspoon had a little more leeway in terms of portraying this strong woman who in many ways was just as complex as her husband. But what she does with a glance with a line with a look at the man who would be her husband -- the little things say so much. June met Johnny when they were both married to other people and stuck with him through his drug addiction and wrenching emotional ups and downs.This role should make Hollywood sit up and notice there is more to Witherspoon than meets the eye.The supporting performances are just as good Robert Patrick as Cashs bitter bile-spewing father; Dallas Roberts as Sun Records founder Sam Phillips; Shooter Jennings playing his father Waylon.Equally astounding is the music -- not just the songs themselves but the fact that the actors do their own singing and playing. Producer James Keach and Mangold were both adamant that whoever played the Cashes would do their own singing. If you wanted to hear Johnny and June Cash sing you could buy a CD they believed. It was a gutsy move but its instrumental in making a very good movie into a great one.Phoenix growls and Witherspoon purrs and their duets are absolutely wonderful. T Bone Burnett (""O Brother Where Art Thou?"") was the executive music director; he deserves plenty of credit for making the music work.Mangolds direction is excellent and the script -- by Mangold and Gil Davis -- captures the complex characters without relying on biopic cliche.Bottom line Get in line to see ""Walk the Line.""

"Black Magic - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Carter Black Magicmovies - reviewAs Johnny Cash Joaquin Phoenix captures the country legend in a spellbinding performanceNovember 18 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe Man in Black is gone but his shadow and his sound live on in Walk the Line the thoroughly entertaining new Johnny Cash film biography.Phoenix gives a soulful and musically dexterous performance as Cash. And the always-winning Reese Witherspoon brings bubbly charm and earthy warmth to June Carter the great love of Cashs life.It tracks Cash from his humble and troubled tragic childhood to his service in the military and his struggles afterward to land in the music business.We follow him into Sun Records and into history as Cash became part of a rockabilly lineup that included Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.We see him struggle with a bad marriage and a drug habit. And we see the lifeline that June Carter came to represent during the long years he pursued her (both were married) and she kept him at arms length a man who couldnt ""walk the line.""Walk the Line invites comparisons to last years award-winning musical bio-pic Ray. Theyre both about beloved musical icons of virtually identical status. They both follow lives of hard knocks hard love won and lost and battles with addiction.But Line uses the biography as backdrop. What it really is is a love story. Its about Cash his rise and fall and the woman he loved and pursued and courted; the woman he led as her song puts it into the ""Ring of Fire.""Director James Mangolds film is framed within one of the highlights of Cashs life his 1968 concert at Folsom Prison. Cash relives his journey as he waits to give the comeback performance that would make him a legend.The script co-written by Mangold and Gill Dennis is faithful to that legend. Its based on Cashs autobiography so naturally his first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin quite good) is played as a shrew. But they also have fun with Cashs reputation. His odd and affected wardrobe choice is always questioned and always earns the same reply.""Whats with the black? You look like youre goin to a funeral.""""Maybe I am"" Phoenix-as-Cash growls.Phoenix an actor long on sensitivity plays the scripts central thesis to the limit that Cash lived his whole life with survivors guilt. Its a bit trite and isnt nearly the obstacle that Ray wore as a badge of honor. But Phoenix gives it soul and makes it work.Witherspoon doesnt so much transform herself into the mountain girl/country royalty that June Carter was. She grafts Carter onto her own brand of spunky.And with Witherspoon in the role its easy to think a bereft Johnny would hike miles through Nashville long after reaching stardom just to propose and have her reject him again.Robert Patrick is solidly mean as his bitter disapproving dad; Shelby Lynne is a virtual non-presence as Cashs long-suffering mother. A couple of good scenes dont become all they could due to weak casting in some supporting roles -- Sun Records Sam Phillips was a huge personality something Dallas Roberts doesnt get across here.But thats quibbling. Walk the Line is a spirited and winning reminder of the man before he became the legend of the giant shadow he cast and of the remarkable woman who cast her shadow over him.

Hoping to land a record contract dark-haired black-clad J.R. Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) sings - drones really. His band Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant plays guitar and bass with the same flat earnestness. A young man sits listening underwhelmed. When famed Sun Records founder Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) tells the singer he doesnt believe a word hes singing Cash gets his back up quicker than a bobcat coming across a cottonmouth. ""You dont think I believe in God?"" asks Cash spoiling for a fight. Thank goodness Phillips stood his ground. Better yet Cash had another song one of a batch he wrote while stationed at an Air Force base in Germany ""Folsom Prison Blues."" It is a pivotal scene in ""Walk the Line"" not only because it shows Cashs craving to make music but because it reveals the singers simmering rage. And its one of two moments that linger long after the credits roll for James Mangolds pulsing valentine to Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash starring Phoenix as the Man in Black and Reese Witherspoon as his rock. The other scene comes much later when Cash has gone down down down into a ring of fire that has little to do with love and everything to do with addiction. Wrecked by pills Cash finds salvation with the aid of June Carter and her parents. What Maybelle (Sandra Ellis Lafferty in a brief wonderful turn as country musics godmother) Ezra (Dan Beene) and June do to help Cash battle his demons is as touching a scene about family values as youre likely to witness this year. Written by Mangold and Gill Dennis and based on two Cash memoirs ""Walk the Line"" recounts Cashs early years and takes us through the late 1960s. In that span there were tours and hit songs tours and a drug bust family and more tours. While Cash and Carters music gives the movie its undeniable soundtrack its their thwarted yet constant tale of friendship and love that makes ""Walk the Line"" a big-movie pleasure. Still the film begins the way one with music as its core value should with the hard tug of guitar and bass. It is 1968. As Folsom prison inmates stomp and clap as his longtime band repeats the boom-chicka chords Cash gathers himself in the prisons woodshop seemingly mesmerized by a buzzsaw. Cashs older brother Jack died because of a lumber mill accident when Cash was 12. What happens for the next two hours is a flashback that takes us from Cashs hardscrabble beginning in Arkansas as the son of an embittered sharecropper to his ascent into an American music icon. Throughout that journey there was June Carter. Before he ever set eyes on her the daughter of roots-music royalty had staked a place in the young mans imagination. Carried on the powerful signals of stations such as Nashvilles legendary WSM Junes voice and those of the Carter clan came through his radio in Arkansas. Junes clan - Mother Maybelle Carter along with A.P. and Sara Carter - had changed American music in the late 20s and 30s as the Carter Family. When Cash begins traveling in revues with a collection of musicians who will alter it again in the mid-50s - Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley among them - he meets June. Hes already married. So is she. When Cash married Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin) he merely found a way to mirror and deepen the pain that began in his childhood home. Not burdened enough with his father Rays disapproval John seeks support from a woman who doesnt honor his dreams either. As played by Ginnifer Goodwin Vivian isnt a villain but even we start to dread going home to her after those rousing shows. Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing. While Phoenixs upper range doesnt sound quite as rich he hits Cashs deep notes - musically and emotionally. In a performance that should revitalize the sense that shes worth believing in Witherspoon comes on all Southern sauciness then finds more fundamental places to go with June. If you know about the tribulations of A.P. and Saras marriage you may think June could have been darker from the start. Indeed Cash-Carter Family experts may find things to complain about. The movie plays fast and loose with the chronology of some of the songs. But for the forgiving (or clueless) among us theres more than enough teasing camaraderie in Johnny and Junes duets and heartfelt drama to keep us content.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 18 2005 Save for later Saved Johnny Cash gets the full bio treatment in ""Walk the Line"" which is being promoted as this years ""Ray."" Like that film its consistently engrossing and filled with great music and strong performances - beginning with Joaquin Phoenix as Cash and Reese Witherspoon as Cashs second wife June Carter. But as with ""Ray"" I often felt like I was viewing a vivid pageant of events rather than a selectively shaped microcosm. ""Capote"" the other big biopic this year is my idea of an artful film biography A crucial incident in the life is used to explain the life.Still who wouldnt want to see a movie about how Johnny Cash became Johnny Cash? After all The Man in Black didnt always wear black. Although director James Mangold and his co-screenwriter Gill Dennis knew Cash and Carter and based the script on Cashs two autobiographies the film doesnt have an ""authorized"" feel to it. If anything Cash acts much worse than the movies other bad behavers - which is saying plenty.After a brief prologue where Cash steadies himself to play to the inmates at Folsom Prison ""Walk the Line"" gets going in rural 40s Arkansas and ends more than two hours later in 1968. In between theres enough heartbreak to satisfy even the most gluttonous appetite. Just for starters As a young boy Cashs revered older brother dies prompting his father (Robert Patrick) to exclaim ""He took the wrong son."" (Patrick also played Elviss father in a TV miniseries. Whats next on the agenda - Roy Orbisons dad?) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Events takes a sharp turn for the better when Cash finds his true voice - aggrieved and dark as a cellar - while auditioning for Sam Phillips Sun Records. This is followed by some birth-of-rock barnstorming with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis (he offers Cash some chili fries) a marriage that dwindles as his stardom shines and throughout it all drugs and booze. What saves our boy is Carter the no-nonsense daughter of country musics First Family. The stars do their own singing and they have an easy rapport both on and off stage. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But this film is finally too conventional to account for Cashs jagged complexities. There is a telling throwaway moment about halfway through when Cash has been busted and his wife sneers ""Now you wont have to work so hard to make people think youve been in jail."" Cash was a true anomaly a poseur who was also the genuine article. A better movie would have made that contradiction its core. Grade B Rated PG-13 for some language thematic material and depiction of drug dependency.

The film traces Cashs career from his early days singing as a boy on the local radio station to his touring days as one of Americas most popular singers. His long and eventually successful courtship of June Carter Cash is also depicted offering viewers a look at the private side of a man whose public image was that of a brooding and talented rebel.

Gus Van Sant pulled it off with Last Days a quiet and intensely particular chamber piece that honored Kurt Cobain with truth over myth. There may be good reason to make a more conventional life of country singer Johnny Cash who in his crazy years traveled with the nascent stars -- Jerry Lee Lewis Elvis Presley Waylon Jennings Carl Perkins -- who set the blueprint for rock-star hard partying. Part love story part concert movie part wild and woolly account of the early days on the rock amp; roll tour circuit James Mangolds Walk the Line is an engaging biopic that would totally lack surprise were it not for Reese Witherspoon and a healthy touch of ambivalence about the populist myth that bound The Man in Black to his adoring public. Walk the Line begins with the famous concert in Folsom Prison where Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) who never spent a day in jail for anything more felonious than drug possession belted out the song that brought him sacks full of sympathetic mail from lovelorn girls and convicts alike. Mangold and screenwriter Gill Dennis have just enough distance from their subject to make this a running joke but they might have made more of how the song became the organizing principle of Cashs mystique and how a pop performer and his audience can come together in a lie thats true to their experience of being dispossessed. Certainly Cashs magnificently lugubrious Everyman repertoire (I love his music but I have to be in a certain kind of poor-me mood to listen to his lyrics without laughing) drew on his lifelong sense of being an outcast in his own family. Left to himself Joaquin Phoenix like his older craggier colleague Sean Penn is often prone to tragic grandiloquence but in Walk the Line he gives a persuasive imitation of the strong silent sex machine whose chronic shyness evaporated once he got onstage where he practically ate the mike and aimed his guitar at the audience like an AK-47. Phoenix is a dignified presence but hardly an electric one and for a while Walk the Line jogs diligently along in the usual explanatory shorthand Cashs childhood scarred by the accidental death of a beloved older brother who was the clear favorite of their sour sharecropper father (Robert Patrick); his ill-advised marriage to a sweetheart whose dreams couldnt differ more from his own; his clumsy early efforts as a gospel singer-songwriter and sudden success once he found a voice; and the slide into drugs drink and depression when the constant touring wore out both him and his marriage. Its only when June Carter (Witherspoon) bounces onstage in a flowered dress with hoop skirt and pretty much takes over the movie just as Carter later took over Cashs life that Walk the Line wakes up. For all her vacuous blue-eyed prettiness Witherspoon has always been a fiercely intelligent presence and now that shes growing up -- her beauty has turned from apple-cheeked to angular -- she brings not just vivacity but a depth and breadth to this young singer who growing up in the shadow of an older sister with a better voice carved a niche for herself by clowning onstage. You can already see in this vulnerable girl the mature Carter who would later save Cash from himself but Walk the Line narrows its focus to the years when Cash tried to win over Carter the devoted mother who gun-shy after two disastrous marriages holds him at bay while hes strung out on booze and pills and comes to understand that before she can become his lover shell have to become his friend. In the inevitable concert sequences Witherspoon and Phoenix who sing their own solos and duets with sweetness and brio make a vital sexy pair the one so held-back and exhausted by his own weakness and rage the other forthright and resilient. Still theres something pat a whiff of official story about Johnny and Junes progression from walking wounded to happily ever after. I have no idea whether Carter really drafted her entire family to help Cash withdraw from his pill-popping whether her father saw Cashs dealer off the premises with a rifle or whether Cash really proposed to Carter onstage which seems uncharacteristic of this famously reticent man (yet perhaps the right venue for someone who came alive only when performing). Like many fact-based movies seduced by copious input from the source -- Mangold and Dennis spent many hours talking to the Cashes before their deaths in 2003 -- Walk the Lines most telling moments take place on the periphery Cash learning how to carouse with his pals whore played by various contemporary rock and blues artists (Waylon Malloy Payne is a feral standout as Jerry Lee Lewis) or profoundly ill at ease with his family (an all but unrecognizable Shelby Lynne is wonderfully dour as Cashs put-upon deeply religious mother). But its in Ginnifer Goodwins compelling turn as Cashs first wife Vivian -- a decent limited woman hanging on for dear life to a man whos as wrong for her as she is for him -- that we see the human wreckage left in the wake of this very public love affair and this very grand myth.

"Walk the Line | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; walk-the-line ) Walk the Line (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli When I spoke to Roger Ebert shortly before first seeing Walk the Line he remarked that he knew almost all of Johnny Cashs songs by heart. I cannot make the same claim. Im familiar with a few of them - mostly those that got radio play - but many of the titles in his catalogue are unknown to me. That didnt impinge upon my ability to enjoy Walk the Line but the statement is necessary to explain my background. Cash devotees may have a different reaction to this picture. In fact although I liked it my bet is that they will love it. Inevitably Walk the Line will be compared to last years Ray. Its understandable. Both are high profile motion pictures about major recording stars who recently died (Cash passed away in 2003 four months after the death of his wife). The kind of music is different but there are similar plot elements chief among which are marital infidelity and drug use. Walk the Line is a better film. Its put together with more elegance the director has more control over the trajectory its not boring (Ray has a tendency to drag) and it feels more like a straightforward account instead of hero-worship. Ray did more whitewashing and fictionalization than Walk the Line. Plus this movie has a driving plotline that Ray lacked - a love story. To me thats what elevates this film. Walk the Line opens in 1944 Dyess Arkansas where it introduces us to a 12-year old Johnny Cash and depicts one of the key events in his early life. The film then skips forward to Landsberg Germany in 1952 (with Joaquin Phoenix taking over the part of Cash) and Memphis in 1955. While there living with his wife Viv (Ginnifer Goodwin) and young daughter he starts a band Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two. After a successful audition with a record producer Johnny finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). His music elevates him to stardom but drug use (uppers) and alcohol abuse threaten to drag him down. They also impede a possible romance with June the love of his life even after Viv has left him. The film continues Cashs story into the late 1960s including scenes from the famous Fulsom Prison concert and ends on an up note. Director James Mangold has streamlined his film to focus on two things the music (a number of Cash songs are played uninterrupted) and the love story. Johnnys drug use becomes a key element in the romance since its ultimately Junes perseverance that saves Johnny not some innate desire to get clean. Ray portrayed its protagonist as an heroic figure. Walk the Line takes a different approach. Johnny is shown to be a flawed human being with a great talent. Theres nobility in Johnny but also more darkness than we see in Ray. Oscar nominations are likely for Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix and it will be tough to argue against them. Witherspoon gives one of her finest performances in years (granted she has been appearing mostly in fluff lately) and Phoenix astonishes. His physical resemblance to Cash is superficial but he has perfected the voice both when speaking and singing. Supporting actors include Robert Patrick as Johnnys unloving father Tyler Hilton as a young Elvis Presley and Shooter Jennings as his father Waylon. The running length of Walk the Line is just about right. 135 minutes is long enough to develop a coherent narrative (rather than making this feel like a ""best of"" story) without dragging things out. I will admit to not having been excited about seeing Walk the Line before sitting down to watch it but Mangold Phoenix and Witherspoon converted me. During the course of the picture someone describes Johnnys voice as being ""steady like a train sharp like a razor."" That sounds to me like a fitting description of Walk the Line as well.

Recently though warts-and-all movies like Ray and Kinsey and Capote which have had the daring to show how their subjects human failings were integral to their greatness have raised the bar for biopics -- for their authenticity and dramatic power. Walk the Line starring Joaquin Phoenix as country-music legend Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as his muse singing partner and stubborn romantic foil June Carter is a big juicy enjoyable wide-canvas biography with a handful of indelible moments but its just compelling enough to make you wish that it had attained the level of artistry of those other films. That said I cant stop thinking about scenes like the one in which Cash as a young singer in Memphis in the mid-50s enters the storefront that houses Sun Records and performs a gospel standard for Sam Phillips (played with sly feelers by Dallas Roberts) who dismisses the number as treacle. He then asks Cash If you had an accident were dying on the road and had to sing one song to express how you felt about life what would it be? With nothing to lose Cash launches into ""Folsom Prison Blues"" and suddenly we hear the famous gravity -- the ominous lyrics and weirdly overdeliberate bass voice that sounds like its trying to negotiate its way out of hell. As the band trickles in Cashs thrilling rockabilly freight train leaves the station. Phoenix who did all his own singing sounds just enough like Cash to make us hear the beauty of his husky reticence and though hes hardly the singers physical double -- Cash had his trademark crags and furrows even when he was starting out -- we can see how nature equipped him to play the Man in Black. His hair is black his eyebrows are black and more than that his eyes are black -- deep coal wells of hidden sorrow. Walk the Line directed by James Mangold (Cop Land) from a script he co-wrote with Gill Dennis lays out Cashs demons in a vigorous if standard fashion. Growing up on a farm in Arkansas young J.R. endures a stern father (Robert Patrick) who makes him feel responsible for his brothers death. Overseas in the Air Force he develops an identification with criminals and Phoenix cultivates a haunted stare that masks a heart of vulnerability. Later touring with Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis (Cash may be showcased as country but its a revelation to see how much of a vintage early rocker he really was) Cash holding his guitar up high as if it were a shield and then staring the audience down expiates his sins through music. He could be a preacher whose sermons have gone electric. As a portrait of Johnny Cash the gravel-voiced country-rock innovator who projected a private hellfire onto even his jauntiest anthems Walk the Line is zesty and satisfying. But when it turns to the tale of how Cash trapped in a miserable marriage spent year after year courting seducing loving yet never quite winning June Carter the movie is on shakier ground. On the road Cash enjoys groupies and pops amphetamines an addiction that will land him in trouble with the law. Yet hes really a gentle soul who yearns to be loved. He and Carter begin to make eyes at each other the moment they meet backstage and when Carters first marriage ends there appears to be little in the way of their getting together. But Carter the scion of a famously traditional Christian singing family feels guilty about her divorce and Cash after coercing her into performing a duet she wrote with her ex-husband makes the mistake of giving her an onstage peck on the cheek. Horrors Its a downhill spiral from there. Walk the Line could turn out to be a monster chick flick because its design is almost mythic Saintly girl has to wait for country-rock bad boy to purge his demons and settle down. But while Witherspoon a fine singer herself makes Carter immensely likable a fountain of warmth and cheer given how sweetly she meshes with Phoe-nix her romantic reticence isnt really filled in. Junes refusal to countenance Johnnys drug use may be a fair obstacle but the main reason hes doing drugs is that she keeps spurning him; hes numbing the pain of his devotion. June is made to seem like a high school virgin protecting her honor and when we see her composing the lyrics to ""Ring of Fire"" it doesnt compute As written this perky straight-and-narrow woman is the last person on earth who would fall through love ""into a burning ring of fire."" At the famous Folsom Prison concert Cash performs ""Cocaine Blues"" and Phoenixs eyes go wild with the pleasure of finally living up to his wrong-side-of-the-law image. Off stage June beams at him. But do her eyes shine because of his generosity in saluting the humanity of these prisoners or because of how deep his need is to feel like hes one of them? In Walk the Line its the former. In a greater movie it would have been both. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix); Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon); Best Costumes; Best Film Editing; Best Sound Mixing Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Go inside the opening gala J.K.

""Walk the Line"" is a strongly acted musically vibrant conventionally satisfying biopic of country/rock/blues legend Johnny Cash and his second wife June Carter. Absorbing and entertaining James Mangolds heartfelt feature follows the predictable format for musical bios encompassing popular singers performance highs and drug-addled lows and could have benefited from a rougher edge in line with the main subjects outlaw image. Already being pushed as this years ""Ray"" Fox release can look forward to swaggering B.O. generally especially from Middle America. Its an exceptional time for biographical performances in Hollywood films what with Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" and David Strathairn in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" already stirring major pre-release excitement. Add to those the lead turns in ""Walk the Line."" Reese Witherspoon does a sensational job as lifelong performer June Carter while Joaquin Phoenix gains in conviction as pic builds to put over a very credible Johnny Cash. Their surprisingly good vocal perfs on the many well-known songs are icing on the cake. Based on two Cash autobiographies and written with input from the couple up to their deaths in 2003 script by Gill Dennis and Mangold spends just enough time on Cashs rural 40s Arkansas youth to establish two keys to his personality the tragic death of his beloved older brother in a dreadful circle-saw accident and his fathers intransigent disdain for Johnny whom he saw as his ""bad"" son. ""The Devil did this"" Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) rails. ""He took the wrong son."" Johnnys Air Force career in Germany is briefly visited to show him buying a guitar and seeing a film about Folsom Prison that inspired him to start composing which comes in handy a few years later when he rescues a hitherto dud audition for Sun Records Sam Phillips by singing the song with the renegade lyric ""I shot a man in Reno/Just to watch him die."" By the time hes 23 in 1955 Johnny has got his first hit ""Cry Cry Cry""; hes married to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) with one daughter born and more on the way; and hes on a wild boogie-woogie tour with the equally young Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne looking more like James Dean than like Lewis) Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton not bad) and June Carter a bubbly sassy performer with personality to spare. Although June is married too she and Johnny establish a strong friendly bond in a well-written diner scene that nicely portends the enduring relationship to come. The tours just keep on comin over the next few years. When June gets divorced Johnny begins coming on to her. But when she bolts after he gets too frisky with her onstage Johnny comes apart triggering the writing of ""I Walk the Line"" his indelible evocation of the difficulty of dealing with marriage and outside temptation something Johnnys not always real good at. He also succumbs to amphetamine addiction on top of the boozing and carousing on tour. By the mid-60s after a decade of hoping and trying Johnny finally gets June to bed down with him but he promptly collapses onstage and goes into a tailspin that includes the implosion of his marriage financial distress and a general withdrawal. Despite the constant hopping about to critical moments in Johnnys life individual scenes are generally convincing and theyre nicely juggled to distribute humor musical highlights and convulsive confrontations. Delightful interludes include a disgusted June discovering Johnny and the other boys still on an all-night bender on a bottle-strewn stage one morning before a matinee and a bit in which Elvis offers Johnny some chili fries. Giving both Johnny and the picture the strength they need is Junes absolutely no-BS attitude toward life. She cant abide Johnnys self-destructive behavior and unwillingness to see things as they are. Still when he hits rock-bottom shes there to provide him with a second chance in life if hes willing. Winning and tough Witherspoon simply could not be better in her most serious fully elaborated performance to date. Professional and musical climax comes with the celebrated January 1968 Folsom Prison performance which is electrifying and sees Phoenixs perf in full flower. Except for Witherspoons Southern accents throughout are on the light side and same can be said for the film itself which has a polished sheen where a greater grittiness would have been appropriate. Although this Johnny Cash walks the walk of the Man in Black its never entirely clear why he was perceived as more dangerous than his contemporaries and a bolder less prefab approach could have helped.
