"Astronaut Farmer Taken for a ride | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAstronaut Farmer Taken for a rideBilly Bob Thornton has a yen for impossible movie characters. Yet his most impossible role of all may be the obsessed flyboy he plays in The Astronaut Farmer a movie that defines the phrase ""willing suspension of disbelief.""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 23 2007 Starring Billy Bob Thornton Virginia Madsen and Bruce Dern. Directed by Michael Polish. 103 minutes. At major theatres.PG  Article Continued BelowBilly Bob Thornton has a yen for impossible movie characters.Hes been a sociopath St. Nick (Bad Santa). A NASA chief attempting to blow up a giant asteroid (Armageddon). A lover of Halle Berry who leaves her in bed while he searches for a bowl of chocolate ice cream (Monsters Ball).Yet his most impossible role of all may be the obsessed flyboy he plays in The Astronaut Farmer a movie that defines the phrase ""willing suspension of disbelief.""As Charles Farmer who is actually a Texas cattle rancher he seeks to create American mythology of the kind that Frank Capra and James Stewart forged in the 1940s with the angel-driven Its a Wonderful Life. The kind of myth where you dont question how or why things happen you just bask in the glow as angels come down from heaven to lead good men to glory.Its a tough assignment to pull off especially for an actor like Thornton who seems more at home with the Hells Angels. The same goes for writer/director Michael Polish and writer/actor Mark Polish the filmmaking brothers whose three previous films Northfork Jackpot and Twin Falls Idaho plumbed darker depths of Americana.The Astronaut Farmer is pure fantasy but it confuses us by seeming to be something that actually could happen.Weve all heard stories about wealthy eccentrics who try to launch their own private space programs and dont they all seem to come from Texas?This movie takes the idea an absurd step further by suggesting that one man an astronaut hopeful grounded by family troubles could build and launch an orbiting space rocket of the kind that took NASAs multitudes of brainiacs billions of dollars to create and fire up.Farmer is a grumpy guy who doesnt particularly seem to deserve the kind of magic he desires.He also incredibly turns down a chance to go up on the space shuttle as an official astronaut an offer made by a former colleague played by Thorntons Armageddon co-star Bruce Willis. Could the Polish Bros. have made this story any harder to buy? These are the kinds of impossible things even the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland would have trouble swallowing with or without breakfast. But all of the actors seem to have bought into the dream.Along for the ride is Virginia Madsen as Farmers devoted wife Audie who could be Laura Bush in a different kind of movie. She and her father Hal (Bruce Dern) cant quite understand why Charles wants to build his own rocket since it could kill him and will bankrupt the family. But they cant help but cheer him as he seeks to outfox the FBI the CIA the FAA the U.S. military and quite possibly the League of Soccer Moms to pursue his orbital ambitions.It all gets back to the ""willing"" part of the suspension of disbelief.You either roll with the hokum or you dont. If you do the essential message of realizing your dreams flies as well as Jimmy Stewarts angel wings. If you dont reality is as close as the nearest window.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Astronaut Farmer"" with Billy Bob Thornton Virginia Madsen Max Thieriot Bruce Dern Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Michael Polish from a screenplay by Mark Polish and Michael Polish. 104 minutes. Rated PG for thematic material peril and language. Several theaters. A mysterious little movie about a man following his dream ""The Astronaut Farmer"" seems to be a visitor from some alternative universe a place where logic and reason and recognizable human behavior have little reign. Billy Bob Thornton looking a tad otherworldly himself (hes quite thin with wondering eyes) plays Charles Farmer a former astronaut-in-training with NASA who never got a chance at space flight. Now a rancher in Texas with a wife (Virginia Madsen) and three kids hes still looking up at the skies and dreaming -- and tinkering with the rocket in which he intends to orbit the Earth. Yes Farmer is building a rocket in his barn with his 15-year-old son Shepard (yes the kids name is Shepard Farmer) acting as co-engineer and Mission Control. Because in this movies universe building a manned rocket thats capable of orbiting the Earth is something easily within the grasp of a guy with a barn a teenager and some out-of-date NASA experience. Meanwhile the Farmer family struggles with its finances (mom Audie works as a waitress and is horrified to learn that Charles has been draining the family coffers to pay for rocket supplies) and the neighbors scratch their heads over Charles exploits. To naysayers his response is simple. ""Its always been my dream"" he says quietly. The brother filmmaking team of Michael and Mark Polish (whose last film was the elegant but often inscrutable ""Northfork"") are making their first studio film here and the result is a sometimes interesting hybrid of blandness and free-floating artistry. Every shot captured by the Polish brothers longtime director of photography M. David Mullen has a grandeur to it; the characters stand in stark silhouettes against the endless lines of the Southwest plains. And a few passing moments are undeniably lovely In one a child in a carnival rocket ride raises her arms happily reaching as if to embrace the sky. ""The Astronaut Farmer"" with its warm family spirit has a genuine sweetness to it and it feels downright curmudgeonly to find fault with its follow-your-dream message. But as Farmer faces ridicule from his neighbors and persecution by government officials alerted by his purchase of thousands of pounds of high-grade fuel (in a nice touch one of the G-men has Darth Vaders theme as his cellphone ringtone) the movie seems to get more and more muddled. By the end its left this Earth entirely orbiting somewhere where dreams like this can become reality -- where astronauts can orbit the Earth in homemade rockets and still make it home in time for dinner.

Pictures family ... more Photo Richard Foreman You could call him the space cowboy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Astronaut Farmer Family drama. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Virginia Madsen and Bruce Willis. Directed by Michael Polish. (PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Assembling a movie that will keep kids anchored in their seats and parents from snoozing doesnt seem like rocket science. But judging from myriad misfires perhaps it is -- in which case the subject matter of ""The Astronaut Farmer"" astronomically increases its chances of succeeding. This exemplary family-friendly entertainment is about well rocket science. Its also about dreaming the impossible dream relying on loved ones to realize a quixotic venture plugging your ears to naysayers and other syrupy messages that in less artistic hands could easily spin into cliche. Michael and Mark Polish identical twins who wrote the script directed by Michael avoid triteness by sheer force of imagination. The small Texas town where Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton) handcrafts a rocket in his barn one valve at a time is presented as both familiar and otherworldly part Norman Rockwell part ""Twilight Zone."" Everything is drenched in a surreal golden glow -- it turns Thorntons hair orange. Like the rocket with which Farmer hopes to blast himself through the Earths atmosphere ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is unmistakably homemade. Although a major studio release theres nothing slick or mass-produced about it. Its quirkiness is part of its enormous appeal. The Polishes made their name with weird stuff like ""Twin Falls Idaho"" in which they play conjoined twins one of whom engages in sex while the other has no choice but to lie beside him watching. The brothers are following a path set by David Lynch the king of weird who ventured into wholesome territory with ""The Straight Story"" and came up with something profound in its simplicity. Maybe getting perverse thoughts out in other movies freed these guys up to tell folksy family stories. They dont come folksier than ""Farmer."" The title character was on course to become an astronaut until his father died and he felt compelled to drop out of NASAs training program to manage the family ranch. Theres a witty concreteness to peoples names that avoids the obvious -- Farmer is a rancher; hes sent to see a nurse Good for a psychiatric evaluation when friends fear hes gone off the deep end in his obsessive desire to make it into space on his own. Thornton who often plays bad boys even when its Santa wouldnt seem an obvious choice for this squeaky clean dreamer idolized by his wife (Virginia Madsen) and their three kiddies (one named Sunshine). But from the first sight of him manfully striding down a long corridor in a space suit the silver slightly tarnished from age you know he will do right by the role. Farmer is so resolute youd think he was heading for the command module instead of a classroom to talk about astronauts. Thornton brings exactly the right blend of confidence and idealism. He could be a Capra hero -- Mr. Farmer Goes to Space. Madsen makes a convincing adoring spouse but is in danger of getting typecast. She plays almost an identical part in ""The Number 23"" also opening today. When the media hear of Farmers spacey plans reporters and cameramen descend en masse. Theyre charmed by his perfect sound bite about a mans gotta dream. FBI CIA and FAA officials on the other hand proclaim him a security risk based on his efforts to purchase 10000 pounds of high-grade fuel. To the government that could only signal a terrorist act. An astronaut friend (Bruce Willis) stops by to admire Farmers rocket complete with mission control and tell him that the big guns will never allow him to get off the ground. The Polishes set up a classic David and Goliath situation leaving no question of whom the audience will root for. There are sufficient surprises along the way so the ending is far from predictable. ""The Astronaut Farmers"" goofy quality makes it totally endearing. Its also super entertaining. Critics are fond of referring to movies as a ""great ride."" With this one the words couldnt be more apt.

The Astronaut Farmer 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Mission Control can you hear me? Come in Mission Control. A foreign object has been sighted on my view screen. Its bipedal ... its shiny ... its ... Billy Bob Thornton in a crinkly silver spacesuit. But hes on horseback Mission Control. This is confirmed. Hello -- do you copy? You must be getting static. I just said The Astronaut Farmer not ""the asters a charmer."" Affirmative Mission Control his name is Farmer. He appears to be a rancher with a NASA fixation. Four more foreign bodies have entered the view screen Im spotting three children plus a wife. Thats Virginia Madsen that cool chick who played death-in-a-trenchcoat in A Prairie Home Companion. Youre right shes got pizazz. Ive spotted an upright cylindrical form in Farmers barn maybe 30 feet tall. But Im blinded by its dazzling metallic surface. Do I smell ... coffee? Could it be ... a thermos? Negative Mission Control. Its a rocket a big one like one of those Atlas missiles that launched the Mercury flights. Let me pilot this rig a little closer so I can see. Yep looks like Farmer built the thing himself and now he wants to launch it through the roof. But wait -- hes frowning. Im not positive Mission Control but I think he needs 10000 pounds of rocket fuel. A new influx of bipedal objects has gathered. Their eyes are wide. Their brows are wiggling. Their mouths are forming words. It sounds like a banker might be threatening to take the ranch. A nurse is giving Farmer a psych exam. She says he wants to leave the planet because hes angry at his daddy. And two dumb-cluck federal agents in aviation sunglasses just showed up aiming to stop the launch. Look theres Bruce Willis an old astronaut buddy from Farmers aeronautics-training days No Mission Control this isnt Armageddon. Ben Affleck is nowhere in sight ... repeat nowhere in sight. Confirm absence of Affleck outside the boosters. Also confirm super-atmospheric presence of high-dudgeon cliches as Farmer chews out the FAA the CIA the FBI various military personnel and NASA. Let me patch you through ""When I was a kid"" hes saying ""they used to tell me I could be anything I wanted to be."" Yes Mission Control I hear it -- either the audios malfunctioning or someone just ripped off Aaron Coplands Lincoln Portrait. I think Im going to be sick and Im telling you its not the dehydrated goulash. Sorry -- forgot to take my Dramamine before departure. After I land Ill send out a memo alerting all adult travelers to the dangers up here though Im sure most kids will enjoy the ride. Who doesnt dream of zooming through space in a fiery rocket? Thornton is back in the barn now backlit by his spaceship; hes looking kind of blurry and Zen like an out-of-focus guru. Im not sure why the Polish brothers hired him. You know those guys -- writer-director Michael and writer Mark the twins who made that movie about a dam and a dying boy and angels sort of. Northfork thats it. Hold on -- Im spinning Ive lost all power Mission Control Incoming absurdities sapping all energy Glutinous screenplay devices gumming the engines Mayday mayday Cant ... breathe.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Hes a farmer. And an astronaut. And kinda funny lookin as they might say in Fargo. Meet Charles Farmer the guy who rides horseback in a silver space- suit from Goodwill and who is building an orbiter in his barn. Would that be funny/amusing? Or funny/wait-right-there-while-I-find-that-restraining-order? The intelligently oddball Polish brothers who wrote directed and produced ""The Astronaut Farmer"" never quite settle that question. Their ambiguity about Farmer Nutjob consistent with the naturally ambiguous performance by actor nutjob Billy Bob Thornton gives their movie an appealing teasing menace. But the fact that they never resolve the tone also dooms ""The Astronaut Farmer"" to a lunar Sea of Obscurity. It tries to be more than an amusing Disney sitcom about crazy dad and his big rocket. But its somewhat less than a deep exploration of character and responsibility. Mark and Michael Polish have a childlike faith in archetypal ideas such as dreams heroes and magic. In movies like ""Northfork"" they craft visual lyrics into sheer poetry. Yet when they try to bolt that indie sensibility to a commercial Titan rocket like ""The Astronaut Farmer"" the aerodynamics go haywire. Longtime lovers of the moonshot era the Polish brothers conceived of Charles Farmer as an adventurer poised between success and despair. Farmer is failing at farming because hed rather revisit his days as a NASA trainee. He never made it into space the first time but his rocket made of spare parts is almost ready to blast dusty Texas into his past. The town thinks hes nuts of course perhaps because he has a habit of rescuing stranded calves while wearing that aluminum foil suit. Ordered into brief therapy with Nurse Goode (more archetypes) he endures slings of arrows like ""How would you like to discuss your desire to leave the planet?"" ""I dont think you understand how close I am to foreclosing"" says his banker. ""I dont think you understand how close I am to launching"" Farmer replies. A darker version of the movie would explore Farmers dream as a death wish probing whether it is a hero or a coward who risks probable dismemberment when his family would be left holding the mortgage. ""The Astronaut Farmer"" steers away from that flight plan sticking largely to a flirty bantering relationship between Farmer and his wife (Virginia Madsen long-suffering as usual.) More small town/big government silliness ensues as the media descend upon the farm and federal agents threaten to take the lead out of rocket mans pencil. We know this will climax (sorry) in the high school gym with Farmer alone at a microphone and NASA blowhards staring down at him from the stage. Once they have set up their premise the Polish brothers get stuck in geosynchronous orbit. Bold Farmer perseveres Corrupted Banker issues warnings Government Lackey fills out ominous paperwork Skeptical But Forgiving Wife throws a few dishes and cleans up her own mess. The Polish brothers recently have written and published their ""Declaration of Independent Filmmaking"" as a practical manifesto. Yet they succumb to their own conspiracy of little corruptions in fashioning a movie big enough to please Warner Bros. They go for Snickers when integrity dictates a Mars bar instead.

"The Astronaut Farmer never achieves lift off - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Astronaut Farmer never achieves lift off Billy Bob Thornton stars as Charles Farmer a rancher who builds a rocket in his barn with junkyard parts. (Richard Foreman/Warner Bros.) By Janice Page Globe Correspondent  |  February 23 2007 Its not that ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is so farfetched.I mean yeah its about a space cowboy in training (Billy Bob Thornton) who quits NASA to concentrate on saving his familys Texas ranch. And yeah the guy ends up building a rocket in his barn -- twice no less because he crashes the first one -- with junkyard parts the aid of a six-figure bank tab and the full support of his neighbors. But none of that is the reason this movie ultimately falls to earth like an expensive chunk of space debris.The real problem with ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is that it has no spark.From the very first shot of Thornton on horseback herding stray cattle in his spacesuit this is a work that often feels orchestrated instead of inspired literal rather than ethereal. Though its vision is as flat as the world is round it asks us to cheer on Charles Farmer a hardheaded dreamer who doesnt always deserve the support of his beautiful wife (Virginia Madsen) his tech-savvy teenage son (Max Thieriot) or his impressionable young daughters (Jasper and Logan Polish offspring of the movies creators). And boy is it loaded down with warmed-over corn (official tagline ""If we dont have our dreams we have nothing"").Director Michael Polish (""Twin Falls Idaho"") and his twin brother/co-writer Mark do know how to be amusing particularly in scenes where the rocket mans genius is psychoanalyzed by a high school nurse and his sponsorship potential is evaluated by the local Dunkin Donuts manager. But they also take themselves way too seriously this time out mishandling many obvious plot absurdities and foolishly insisting that the American dream is the same as the American dream-at-all-costs.Farmer isnt Neil Armstrong or John Glenn; hes David Blaine with sketchier priorities and less common sense. Even if most people will gladly suspend disbelief for an honest well-written story about a misunderstood renegade this is not that story.Thornton plays his Capra-esque thoroughly flawed everyman with easygoing restraint that might be welcomed anywhere else; here it just contributes to the lack of magic. And Madsen is fine if unchallenged She has little to do other than waitress fret accept repeat.Bruce Dern shuffles around as Farmers regret-filled father-in-law Tim Blake Nelson is the helpful lawyer who battles government dolts and party poopers (because what American doesnt want the neighbors to have 10000 pounds of missile-grade fuel for their private Mercury-Atlas replica?) and theres a perky uncredited cameo that re-teams Thornton with a well-known action star.""The Astronaut Farmer"" does not acknowledge being inspired by any real person or thing and in a way thats comforting. The kind of people who really build their dreams in barns have to be far more interesting.Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Then I remembered an old Bob and Ray radio skit in which the roving reporter Wally Ballou interviews a man who plans to build his own tunnel beneath the Hudson River. The man explains that he is doing this because hes tired of paying tolls to go in and out of Manhattan. But isnt building a tunnel like that hard? Wally asks. ""Not really"" his subject replies. ""What you do is get a shovel dig down for a while and then dig straight out."" The movies hero played by Billy Bob Thornton is the space-cadet soul mate of that amateur sandhog. The difference between the movie and the radio skit is that the movie takes its subject seriously. Really seriously and ever so earnestly -- its all about uplift. Charles Farmer isnt supposed to be a space cadet. In the hoary tradition of Frank Capra -- never has a Capra knockoff mustered more cliches -- Farmer is supposed to be a little guy with a big dream and a bigger heart a guy who puts himself and his loving family through some difficult times but still a fearless guy with a can-do spirit who becomes a national hero because he wont let anyone stand in the way of his dream not even if it means taking on those heartless bigwigs in Washington. ENLARGE Its clear from the very first shot -- an astronaut on horseback beneath a vast Western sky -- that the movie will be for better or worse something special. Maybe the rider is crazy a cowboy with a Buzz Lightyear fixation who goes around half-suffocating himself in a space suit and helmet. But a shiny silver rocket stands on its tailfins in his barn. Then maybe hes a crackpot tinkerer who actually believes that his home-made spaceship can break the surly bonds of Earth. Or maybe its a parody of the cockeyed optimism dispensed by the rocket-boy drama ""October Sky"" or of the hapless Wernher von Braun biopic ""I Aim at the Stars"" (for which Mort Sahl suggested the alternate title ""I Aim at the Stars but Often Hit London""). But no this is Billy Bob Thornton a specialist at playing no-nonsense guys who are eccentric but perfectly sane. And the filmmakers -- the director Michael Polish and his writing partner (and twin brother) Mark Polish -- want us to understand that Charles Farmer has the right stuff. An aerospace engineer and former Air Force pilot Farmer was on his way to becoming an astronaut until tragedy struck in the sort of overworked back story thats supposed to confer plausibility. Whats more one of Farmers astronaut buddies played by an uncredited Bruce Willis comes to check out the project takes one look at the rocket and says evidently on the strength of its sheen ""You built this thing? That is some serious engineering"" This movie is some muddled imagineering. Its a glib fantasy that soars beyond the misinformation belt into the vacuous realm of misinspiration. No one asks pointed questions about anything but money of which Farmer seems to have woefully little. His clueless wife Audie played by Virginia Madsen and his bright-faced kids have bought so fully into his insanity (which is meant to be seen as wisdom) that his 15-year-old son takes on the job of flight controller. When things go wrong (before they go inspirationally right) Audie starts to lose faith but she finally sees the light and declares in one of the dumbhead classic lines of all time ""Without the rocket were just a dysfunctional family"" And with the rocket they are what? Just props for a preposterous premise. (Useful props an appealing intimacy suffuses several scenes with the family at the kitchen table.) The oddest thing about this very odd movie is that it doesnt seem to know what to make of itself. Here it is positing faith perseverance and family values as the basic ingredients of Farmers climactic blast-off. Yet bogus uplift gives way to genuine downdraft in a coda that finds the hero chatting casually with Jay Leno. Suddenly the astronaut Farmer is just sly old Billy Bob doing yet another guest shot on yet another broadcast of the Tonight Show. Thats a new definition of weightlessness. Amazing Grace ""Amazing Grace"" is a case of good works done well. This admirable historical drama directed by Michael Apted from a script by Steven Knight tells the personal and also rousingly political story of how the pioneering abolitionist William Wilberforce struggled to end the slave trade in the British Commonwealth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. (The slaves provided cheap labor for Jamaicas sugar plantations.) Wilberforce as played by the excellent Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd has his own struggle; he is torn between his passion for politics and his love of God. To resolve the conflict he does Gods work in a House of Commons that views the enslavement of black Africans as an economic necessity and that resists his best efforts for decades. The film takes its title from the hymn that was written by Wilberforces friend and mentor John Newton a slave trader turned monk to atone for his sins. Newton is played by Albert Finney who is far from the only formidable actor in a cast that includes Michael Gambon Ciaran Hinds Rufus Sewell Benedict Cumberbatch Toby Jones Bill Paterson and Romola Garai. The Senegalese singer Youssou NDour makes his acting debut as Oloudaqh Equiano an African slave who bought his freedom settled in London and wrote a best seller about his life. The Number 23 ENLARGE Jim Carrey in The Number 23. In ""The Number 23"" Jim Carrey plays a dog catcher Walter Sparrow whos beset by obsessive thinking Everything in his addled brain adds up to 23. (Virginia Madsen is once again the heros clueless wife.) The movie adds up to nothing at all despite Joel Schumachers efforts as director Matthew Libatiques stylish cinematography and layer upon layer of droning complexity. Mesmerized by a mysterious novel with the same title as the film Walter finds frightening parallels between his life and that of the books murderous detective Fingerling a role that Mr. Carrey also plays. Theres little in this first script by Fernley Phillips but bloodless notions -- nothing that might qualify by the light of day as entertainment. Yet the film has its own grim fascination as an example of another kind of obsessive thinking -- the process through which a studio apparatus is brought to bear on developing an idea that defies development. Starter for Ten If James McAvoys dynamic performance as the young doctor in ""The Last King of Scotland"" was overshadowed by Forest Whitakers portrait of Idi Amin as how could it not have been Mr. McAvoy gets his chance to shine as the star of ""Starter for Ten"" a surprisingly agile and delightfully warm romantic comedy set in the 1980s with a not-so-hot-for-export title. (Its a catch-phrase from a real-life British quiz show called ""University Challenge."") Hes Brian Jackson an earnest working-class nerd whose desire ""to know everything"" stands him in good stead as a member of Bristol Universitys academic team on TV. As bright as he is though he cant figure out how to choose between Alice Eves drop-dead gorgeous (and very funny) Alice whose Flashdance sweater hangs so low off one shoulder that it threatens to capsize her and Rebecca Halls funny (and utterly enchanting) Rebecca a campus activist with a gift for self-irony. Rest assured that Brian finally gets it right and that ""Starter for Ten"" gets things right too. Tom Vaughan directed -- in an auspicious feature debut -- from David Nichollss smart lively script.    DVD TIP ""Rory OShea Was Here"" (2005) a flawed but enjoyable comic drama set in contemporary Dublin stars James McAvoy as a severely disabled young Irishman with a spectacularly able mouth. Romola Garai who plays William Wilberforces wife in ""Amazing Grace"" is Siobhan a supermarket clerk -- I described her in my review as ""surely the most beautiful supermarket clerk in the Western world"" -- who becomes Rorys live-in attendant.

To this rarefied company we must now add ""The Astronaut Farmer"" a nut brain fable that is all the more perversely enjoyable for being seriously intended.Billy Bob Thornton is Charles Farmer an aerospace engineer who dropped out of NASAs astronaut training program to return home and care for his sick father. Farmer is actually more of a rancher than a farmer but mostly hes a loafer. Or at least thats how he comes across until we discover that in his spare time apparently he has built his own fully equipped rocket in a barn on his ranch in Story Texas. (Located near Capra Valley no doubt.)Charles is one of those guys who has a dream and wont let anybody forget it least of all his pathologically understanding wife Audie (Virginia Madsen) his two cutesy-poo daughters Sunshine and Stanley and his 15-year-old homespun genius son Shepard (Max Thieriot). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Shepard by the way is named for Alan Shepard. Stanley is named for Stanley Kubrick. Is it possible that the identical-twin writing-directing team of Michael and Mark Polish are unaware that Kubrick had a monumental fear of flying? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Although the ranch is in foreclosure because of that pesky rocket money drain Charles and his family remain starry-eyed at the prospect of him blasting off into the ozone. He takes the kids out of school to help him sweat the small stuff - like procuring 10000 pounds of high-grade fuel. This little gambit raises a red flag with the FBI CIA and FAA all of whom are portrayed as cartoon meanies standing in the way of Charless realizing his dream. The fact that Charles would be igniting what amounts to a great big bomb in a populated community never registers with him. ""Maybe Im crazy"" he says ""but I still believe that if we dont have our dreams were nothing."" Maybe hes crazy?About halfway through the movie I thought the Polish brothers were pulling the audiences collective leg but no there are too many meltingly beautiful sunset vistas for that too many heartfelt close-ups of Billy Bob arching his eyebrows skyward.Bruce Willis playing an astronaut buddy of Charless is suitably impressed with his friends handiwork in the barn but nevertheless tries to convince him to try for a passenger seat on a space shuttle instead. Its an eminently sane suggestion which of course is why Charles declines it.When Clint Eastwood made ""Million Dollar Baby"" he started out with a live-your-dream story and swerved it into something darker and far less conventional. In ""The Astronaut Famer"" I thought that perhaps the Polish brothers were going for the same sort of thing after Charless initial attempt at glory goes awry. Maybe the movie would be about how some dreams should quite sensibly remain dreams?Nope. Charles believes that every man deserves a second chance. So he goes ahead and gives himself a third.When he finally makes it into outer space you might think that the Polish brothers would at least shoot the works and offer us some eye-popping views. But the space imagery is prosaic. So are the space thrills. At one point Charless console goes dark but soon enough a few wires are crossed and hes back in business. Han Solo couldnt have done it any better.This has not been a good month for astronauts. First that NASA diaper lady and now this. How did the right stuff go so wrong?

"The Astronaut Farmer A Pleasurable Liftoff washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies The Astronaut Farmer A Pleasurable Liftoff Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 23 2007 ""The Astronaut Farmer"" is a surefire test of our ability to believe in anyone with a dream -- including a soft-spoken Texan who figures if he points his homemade rocket in the right direction and juices it with enough fuel hell orbit the globe and get back home in time for dinner. It helps us considerably that the man in the spacesuit -- a silvery ""Buck Rogers""-style outfit that laces up like a set of granny boots -- is Billy Bob Thornton the actor whose relaxed assurance can boost even the hokiest of roles. Hes Charles Farmer an aspiring astronaut who had to jettison his career thanks to a family crisis. But in the years since hes been running a farm -- rather ineptly -- in Story Tex. and dreaming of making it into space. As for the rocket -- well who needs Houston? -- hes been building it himself in the barn. Sure its the corniest of conceits but ""Astronaut"" delightfully taps into one of our deepest cultural values -- the one about the pursuit of happiness. And the movies unpretentious lightheartedness which echoes the old-fashioned corn-fed lore of Frank Capra or even ""The Andy Griffith Show"" makes it blissfully easy to sign on for this good-natured voyage. Written by Mark and Michael Polish (Michael is also the director) ""Astronaut"" doesnt sweat the small stuff of veracity. Its willful innocence is its charm and its safeguard. And to watch it is to protect the movie -- and ourselves -- from the killjoy rules of reality. Which is why we gamely ignore the laws of rocket thrust and atmospheric reentry and why we practically celebrate Charless low-tech control panel -- manned by his 15-year-old son Shepard (Max Thieriot) -- that will supposedly guide him around the world. And its definitely why we quietly applaud Charless wife Audrey (Virginia Madsen) who -- in the secular-Madonna tradition of all screen wives who stand by their dreamer husbands -- smiles and steels herself for the inevitable countdown. After all if ""Audie"" were really taking stock of the situation the ink would be dry on the divorce papers by the end of Act 1 The farm is facing foreclosure. The Polish brothers are best known for such eccentric otherworldly fare as 1999s ""Twin Falls Idaho"" which starred the filmmakers as a pair of mystical conjoined twins. So its refreshing -- and certainly surprising -- to see them make the kind of traditional movie that a generation ago would be half of a Saturday afternoon double bill at the local Rialto. Yet leave it to the filmmakers to lace the movie with winks to their art house fans. The more conventional developments in the movie -- the FBI becoming interested in a loner whos looking to buy 100000 pounds of rocket fuel -- are treated with arms length wryness. One of the FBI agents is presented as an adorable almost Disneyesque goofball. And a scene in which Charles makes an emotional speech before Federal Aviation Administration inspectors is ticklishly funny for the way he twits their humorless logic before pulling out his Capraesque trump card A vote against Charles is one against the freedom to be American. Most of the outstanding supporting players have earned their spurs in the indie-movie world including Bruce Dern Jon Gries (the nutty uncle in ""Napoleon Dynamite"") Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"") and longtime character actor J.K. Simmons. Theres also Bruce Willis who makes an eleventh-hour appearance as Charless old flying pal. The result a PG-rated movie thats savvy about its schmaltziness yet not so postmodern that it has to let us know. Like ""October Sky"" the true story of a West Virginia boy who dreams of building rockets and ""Field of Dreams"" the Kevin Costner baseball fable it engenders audience goodwill with characters we care for. The Astronaut Farmer (109 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for adult themes including domestic tension and scenes of peril and some profanity.

"Astronaut Farmer The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; astronaut-farmer-the ) Astronaut Farmer The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""To dream the impossible dreama| This is my quest to follow that star no matter how hopeless no matter how fara| To reach the unreachable star."" Perhaps no sentiment better expresses what The Astronaut Farmer conveys than those lyrics by Joe Darion from Man of La Mancha. Like many similar inspirational motion pictures this one requires a high level of suspension of disbelief but one would expect no less from a modern day fairy tale. Once that hurdle is cleared The Astronaut Farmer offers dreams obsession faith courage and redemption. The path from beginning to end is surprisingly non-linear and the film offers a surprise or two (effectively ruined by the tell-all trailer that irons out every plot twist in two minutes of spoilerage). On the whole The Astronaut Farmer does what the Polish Brothers must have envisioned when they put this movie into development. Everyone thinks Charles Farmer (Billy Bob Thornton) is nuts. After all he has spent the majority of his adult life building a rocket in his barn. No believes it will ever get off the ground except Charles; his wife Audrey (Virginia Madsen); his children Shepard (Max Thieriot) Stanley (Jasper Polish) and Sunshine (Logan Polish); and his father-in-law Hal (Bruce Dern). They have faith although whether it is well-placed remains to be seen. Charles has sunk every last cent into the endeavor. His 300-plus acre ranch is mortgaged six times and the bank is ready to foreclose. He has less than 30 days to get the rocket into space or risk losing his dream. However when he starts making inquiries about buying premium grade fuel the government takes interest and soon Charles is at the epicenter of two storms one political and one media-oriented. The emotional core of the film is perhaps described best by Hal. In arguing that Charles is a great father he observes that the Farmer family not only eats meals together but they share the same dream. The Astronaut Farmer is about the necessity of chasing dreams and never giving up even when the dream seems unattainable. Later when Charles considers stopping because the price has become too high his wife remarks that without the rocket theyre just an ordinary dysfunctional family. Its the dream that has made them unique. Its nice to see Billy Bob Thornton playing someone other than a variation on his Bad Santa personality. Here hes the likable underdog - a loving husband and father who sees his dream not as an obsession but as the glue that binds them together. He is pursued by ghosts from the past one of which threatens to undo him. Virginia Madsen is solid as his supportive wife although the part doesnt demand much range. Smaller supporting roles go to some familiar faces including Bruce Dern as Audreys father J.K. Simmons as the head of the F.A.A. and an uncredited Bruce Willis as a former shuttle pilot. The Polish Brothers working in a more mainstream arena than they traversed for their previous feature Northfork have crafted an affectionate motion picture that plucks at the heartstrings without becoming too melodramatic. The Astronaut Farmer is one of those movies that makes an audience want to cheer and clap. From a real world engineering standpoint the movie doesnt stand up to scrutiny but it is dramatically effective. Some might think the PG rating signals a kids film but while The Astronaut Farmer represents suitable viewing material for younger audiences it evidences dramatic and thematic maturity. No adult should feel ashamed seeing it because regardless of the age of the viewer the reward is worth the investment of 100 minutes.
