Mark Wahlberg left and Will Ferrell in Columbia Pictures comedy ""The Other Guys."" Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald8/4/2010 Editor rating 3 Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay have collaborated on three other movies -- Step Brothers Talladega Nights and Anchorman -- but theyve never been so slyly funny as they are in The Other Guys a buddy-cop satire so hilarious that even longtime Ferrell haters (me) cant resist it. Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star as pencil-pushing New York cop partners with entirely different approaches to the job. Prim Gamble (Ferrell) is the nerdy forensic accountant who would rather fill out paperwork than chase a bad guy. Perpetually angry Hoitz (Wahlberg) longs for action but hes stuck on desk duty for what has to be one of the worst mistakes a New York cop can make (no not for wearing a Red Sox jersey to work but close). Theyre the laughingstocks of the department the antitheses of the glamorous hot-dogging partners Highsmith and Danson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson making delicious fun of their tough-guy personas) who get the headlines notoriety and bad guys. Then Gamble and Hoitz get a shot at a real case when an investigation into a scaffolding-permit scandal yields surprising dividends involving a big-time investor (Steve Coogan). The partners are forced out of their rut much to the dismay of their skeptical captain (Michael Keaton who is funny enough to deserve more screen time). The cast -- which also includes Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr. as mocking co workers and Eva Mendes as Gambles inexplicably hot wife -- is uniformly loose displaying none of the sloppy humor that results when improvisation reigns unchecked (see Adam Sandlers Grown Ups for an example of what can go wrong when theres too much noodling around with the script). The humor is that rare perfect balance of broad and satiric. The Other Guys is the sort of movie that generates some of its best jokes quietly in the background or as quick-hit throwaway lines while other terrific gags are defiantly over the top. Even the films strange statistics-filled final credits are uniquely amusing. And if Ferrell has never been your cup of tea fear not; hes a solid part of the ensemble. Even someone who hated such Ferrell classics as Old School (me) will enjoy his company in the The Other Guys. Cast Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Michael Keaton Steve Coogan Eva Mendes Rob Riggle Damon Wayans Jr. Samuel L. Jackson Dwayne Johnson. Director Adam McKay. Screenwriters Adam McKay Chris Henchy. Producers Patrick Crowley Jimmy Miller. A Columbia Pictures release. Running time 107 minutes. Crude and sexual content language violence some drug material.

Comments (2) The Other Guys Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2010 This is the fourth feature that Will Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay have collaborated on and once again they deliver laugh-out-loud if ultimately disposable comedy with mixed messages about arrested male development. Ferrell plays a milquetoast New York policeman most comfortable behind his desk and Mark Wahlberg plays his partner eager to redeem himself after accidentally shooting Yankees star Derek Jeter in the leg. Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are around early in a hilarious send-up of badass cops who routinely trash the city in pursuit of criminals and whose demise becomes the ultimate expression in perverse machismo and Michael Keaton is a stitch as an emasculated police captain moonlighting as a retail store manager.

The Other Guys may lack depth insight ambition or artistic integrity. But with no less than three successful running gags - one involving four tramps having sex in a cop car - its hard to imagine a sane audience complaining.The other guys are Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Mark Wahlberg). Theyre decent cops stuck on desk duty in the shadow of superior officers Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and  Highsmith (Samuel L Jackson). Theres a plot in there somewhere -its got something to do with Steve Coogan as a corrupt businessman - but frankly its not worth thinking too much about. This is a movie with a single purpose which it pursues with relentless efficiency and a spectacular rate of success The Other Guys just wants to make you laugh until it hurts.To this end writer-director and regular Ferrell  collaborator Adam McKay employs a catalogue of tried-and-tested techniques. There are two solidly drawn superbly played mismatched heroes (Wahlberg has never been better). Theres the sprawling cast of lunatic suporting characters notably Michael Keatons TLC-quoting police captain. Theres the usual unlikely romantic pairing Ferrells nerdy obsessive loser is married to an appealingly self-deprecating Eva Mendes. And theres a wealth of  joyously berserk idiot humour fusing slapstick and satire surrealism and stream-of-consciousness improv into what could well prove the funniest movie of the year.

We wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer on this oneFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 5 2010ktbFeaturedBecause of a good Timeout review I actually went to see this film. I usually like Will Ferrell and most of the actors in this film but really it was awful. I considered walking out I was so bored. I barely raised a smile at most of the jokes and the rest of the cinema was with me - the audience laughed only once or twice during the entire movie. Probably the worst film I have seen all year - makes Life As We Know It look sublime by comparison (which even though it was terrible was at least funny at times).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 19 2010ElizabethFeaturedThere were about four people in there when I went. This is just boring and its not funny at all. Will Ferrell never does or says funny things he just says one stupid thing after another until you feel the urge to slap him silly. Everything is also done so many times over and over. Just boring and waste of money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 13 2010TRUTHTELLER.FeaturedThe line jumped as I wrote.

So did I.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 5 2010ColeAJFeaturedWent to see this film with my family and it was a first we all walked out after about an hour short on laughs and laborious.

Mark Wahlberg shouted every line he had. The premis was a good one but the writer obviously couldnt decide whether to make it a total farce or not. The only vaguely amusing moment was a silent punch-up but judging by the almost total lack of response from the audience in the cinema I was in its not worth the admission price.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 20 2010julesFeaturedSome funny moments but spoiled by the hollywood effects and explosions in my opinion seems like these american comedies cant just settle for humour they need loud bangs and fight scenes every ten minutes to sustain the american audiences attention??/ At times had trouble understanding the dialog because the backing music and sound effects were to loud. Not as funny as Anchor man or Blades of glory.but made me laugh more than the uber hyped four lions.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 19 2010Ed KingFeaturedThe Other Guys - youll either be in the 20 per cent that laughed or the rest that didnt. Much as I love Will Ferrell the jokes were too offbeat and in many cases just lame.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 18 2010MikeFeaturedAnyone who was a fan of the ""Naked Gun"" movies is in for a treat - there are definitely undertones of NG blundering good cops about this film. But beware this film starts really slowly and in the first 15 minutes you wonder whether this was a good choice of movie - but the scene is being set for Wilf Ferrells geeky/seemingly humdrum life. When the humour turns up its brilliant - in places side splittingly funny. At other times this movie seems to amble along and seems a bit lost. That said when Allens (Wilf Ferrell) wife (Eva Mendes) shows up the humour and action go into overdrive - shes a cracking actress. Wahlbergs okay in this but Im not sure what he brought to the movie that another ""name"" couldnt have - glimpses of storylines featuring Wahlberg werent followed through. I really enjoyed this film but would rate it as 3 stars - the pace and script can be patchy. But I havent laughed so hard during a movie for quite a while. Good enough to see again in a few weeks if theres nothing much on. Memorable line - Wahlberg ""Where did you learn to drive like that?"" Ferrell ""Grand Theft Auto"". Youll never see a red Prius and not think of this movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 17 2010scrumpyjackFeaturedWhat is all this bullshit? Lets focus Enjoyable clap trap and no more. Good performances (Keaton espically) raise this.....but 4 star? forget it  6+/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 17 2010Jon SlatteryFeaturedAre you insane??? I just saw this movie cause you gave it 4 stars. I would give it 3 at the most. Sure it has its moments but most of it is drab. I guess if you saw it in a crowded moviehouse it might be funnier - I saw it with just the early afternoon filmgoers in the middle of the week. I completely rate Time Outs reviews above any other but I cant believe this got 4 stars. Were you high?

The words come straight out of his mouth so theres no denying it. ""Hey I got a weird sense of humor. Im a sick puppy"" admits the hapless cop he plays in The Other Guys a Ferrellized spoof of the buddy-cop action genre. Ferrell is one of the stranger figures currently making movies. Hes one of the stranger figures in the history of American film. What makes him particularly strange is his enthusiastic embrace by the mainstream -- he makes huge piles of money - despite exercising a form of protracted comic absurdity that tests the boundaries of weirdness. Especially (though not exclusively) in his collaborations with director Adam McKay Ferrell draws out his gags beyond the usual punch line toward outer limits of man-boy eccentricity. The Other Guys is a typical vehicle for Ferrells atypical humor It begins with an idiot in this case New York Detective Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and moves on from there. This time the idiot has a partner the combustible Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) best known for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter during the World Series. Allen and Terry rarely leave their desks and earn frequent abuse from their colleagues on the force including Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as a pair of destructively cocky hotshots. Then the hotshots suddenly exit the picture - in an hysterically outre scene that classifies I think as the steepest dive into surrealism ever attempted by either actor. From there the screenplay (by McKay and Chris Henchy a writer on Ferrells altogether Dadaist Land of the Lost) turns to the usual business for summer cop flicks bad guys shootouts chase scenes. The villains include a hulking Australian (Ray Stevenson) and a Bernie Madoff figure with soft hair (Steve Coogan) or so says Allen. Cameos follow as do many jokes about Allens hot wife a hubba-hubba emergency room physician in the form of Eva Mendes. There are flashbacks to Allens earlier career running a campus prostitution ring sparking a duet ""Pimps Dont Cry."" And dont forget the frozen Matrix-style barroom tableau with drunken antics. If you want more plot Im sorry but I cant supply it. Its confusingly edited and entirely beside the point except as an excuse for long Ferrellian riffs on disparate subjects. Wahlberg pops off when required  and he offers a few blank stares of incomprehension that nicely exploit his gift for blandness. (During one of Ferrells early monologues a disquisition on tuna and lions Wahlberg looks as though hes barely stifling the urge to crack up.) Through it all Ferrell is as Ferrell does. Hes a non sequitur with frizz. In The Other Guys his shtick takes on an abstracted meta quality asking us if hes funny while hes trying to make us laugh. Sit through the end credits and youll find one more scene posing one more iteration of the question Does he have a sense of humor? Well yeah. But as Allen says he is one sick puppy. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Upcoming LEGO Apple Mini Build for free w/ registration Kitchen and Bath at Home Depot Up to 40% off + free shipping...

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 06 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Other Guys Directed by Adam McKay Written by Adam McKay and Chris Henchy Starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg Have you ever seen a movie you half-liked a lot? The new Will Ferrell comedy The Other Guys about a couple of bottom-of-the-rung detectives in a New York police precinct has some lovely ridiculous bits of improvised verbal business and surprise turns. The first third of the movie plays like Law and Order reimagined by Abbott and Costello. This is Ferrells return to working with Adam McKay ( Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers) and the blend of macho posturing and bromance sensitivity is both refreshingly understated and bizarre. Ferrell plays Allen Gamble a milquetoast forensic accountant with the perky posture and smirk of a self-righteous adolescent. ""At the age of 11 I audited my parents"" he says. The line seems to perfectly explain his arrested state of wounded self-importance. He finds himself promoted to the detective squad room teamed up with a seething hothead Tony Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Allens a would-be team player who loves writing up other cops paperwork. Tony a not overbright cop is smarting over his demotion for a trigger-happy error involving a sports celebrity. What especially annoys Tony is how the departments two overconfident destructive stars - Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) - are shameless in asserting their superiority to the ""other guys"" in the department including Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans as rival second-raters. Overseeing them all is Michael Keaton dizzily distracted as den-mother captain whos working a second job at Bed Bath and Beyond so ""my son can explore his bisexuality at NYU."" Whats at stake? Masculinity ultimately and the cops-as-heroes rhetoric that is subjected to some overdue satire. The top cops brag about the women theyre obliged to sleep with and awards theyve earned. Tony who wears humiliation badly turns on Allen as the lowest member of the macho pecking order He tells him he makes a sound like girl when he pees. The character is a parody of the kind of parts Wahlberg often plays; indeed the entire movie appears to be inspired by one of his lines in the The Departed. (""Im the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy."") Though its a different genre The Other Guys is a showcase for the actors intense commitment even in the most absurd situations. Through most of the set-up Wahlberg rants and Ferrell does his passive-aggressive riffs and the chemistry works superbly midst a series of playful twists. Allen seems to be an improbable babe magnet. To Tonys incredulity Allen has a sizzling wife (Eva Mendes) and vampy ex-girlfriend (Natalie Zea). Shes married to a gay husand (Brett Gelman) who threatens Tonys anxious grasp on his masculinity. If The Other Guys had simply rolled along in cars and offices with Ferrell playing his Little River Band tapes and driving his Prius while Wahlberg fumed all would be fine. McKay and Ferrell who started the improv website Funny or Die have more ideas for bits than they know what to do with when it comes to silly and deadpan. Then unfortunately the Other Movie gets in the way. What started off like a clever episode of The Office expands and deteriorates into something resembling Rush Hour 3. Part action flick part corporate skullduggery the Other Movie is a lead weight pulling down the merry balloon of the first half. The chase-and-shoot action sequences are slick (producer Patrick Crowley hails from the Bourne movies) but numbingly familiar. Instead of communicating excitement they feel like a good opportunity for a washroom break. Even worse is a convoluted corporate crime plot involving a wasted Steve Coogan and an unnecessary Anne Heche which labours for a bit of Bernie Madoff/Goldman Sachs topicality. As the plot accelerates the jokes become fewer and more repetitive culminating during the closing credits with an Al Gore-like PowerPoint presentation explaining corporate Ponzi schemes. Its as if Ferrells accountant character decided the audience needed a lesson to pay for its laughs. When the action/conspiracy blockbuster crashes into the movie it leaves the smart little comedy spinning its wheels in the ditch. The last half introduces a few new shticks - the discovery of Allens dark alter-ego and a bit with a grandmother carrying obscene messages between Allen and his wife - but they are crude and repeated with diminishing impact. The smart and the stupid do battle here and its no spoiler to indicate which side wins Lets just say with mixed emotions that theres the making of an action-comedy movie franchise here.

""The Other Guys"" is one of Will Ferrells funniest performances.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There is a lot of snick-snick bang-bang kaboom in the cop-buddy comedy ""The Other Guys."" And as indulgent as that action can be the blow-stuff-up verities are part of the point of this rollicking ride about excess success and testosterone anxiety starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. If the low-on-yuks ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is an example of what makes a comedy peculiarly French and not easily translated ""The Other Guys"" suggests what is proudly goofily American. Written by director Adam McKay and Chris Henchy ""The Other Guys"" unfolds as a fiscal morality tale. Two rock-star-like Manhattan detectives strain the citys coffers on the way to minor busts. Yet Highsmith and Danson are hailed as civic heroes. Samuel L. Jackson is over-the-top as Highsmith. So too is Dwayne Johnson as Danson. Other cops in the station house are merely fans the help or wannabes. Ferrell and Wahlberg play two of them Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz. Gamble (Ferrell) has skills as a forensic accountant but no on-the-beat experience. To fuming partner Hoitz (Wahlberg) Gambles not the real deal -- just a breathing humming galling sign of how far hes fallen. Hoitz was on the path to detective when he made a monumental error. Ever since hes been known around the squad room and the city as the Yankee Clipper. While Hoitz bristles and fellow cops jockey for position on a major case the exploits of global financial titan David Ershon (Steve Coogan) capture Gambles attention. It turns out to be Gamble and Hoitzs moment to bond (or not) to excel (or blow it) to make Capt. Gene Mauch (Michael Kea ton) proud or drive him to early retirement. Doubt the American-fable vibe of Gamble and Hoitzs saga? Well Ice-T of ""Law and Order SVU"" fame provides the oh-so-aware narration. Long before summer-movie hopes were dashed again and again by summers studio fare the pairing of Ferrell and Wahlberg teased with potential. Expectation met. Ferrell deadpans then shifts to the wantonly absurd with the same impassive face. This is one of his funniest performances. Wahlberg -- a favorite -- has a talent for the masculine hysterical. His is a Y-chromosome thing in which testosterone seems to commingle with worry. With his confused stare and hushed delivery he often appears one beat away from losing it whether hes an existentially flummoxed firefighter in ""I Huckabees"" or a stricken dad in pursuit of his daughters killer in ""The Lovely Bones."" Hoitz often loses his grip on the reins of his anger. A former girlfriend (Lindsay Sloane) figures in. Bullying insecurity does too. This generations Raquel Welch Eva Mendes is wonderful to gaze upon and terrifically game as Gambles ""ball and chain."" Surprisingly the jokes about how a guy like Gamble landed an ER doc like Sheila never run out of breath. Indeed boneheaded machismo and guy anxiety fill the tank of this lunatic ride. There is so much fast and furious pleasure in the gags that the occasional misfires can be forgiven. Almost. A joke about homeless folk seems out of character with the films big lessons. A scene over braised shortribs at the family dinner table teeters on a different unfunny energy. ""The Other Guys"" proves that while McKay amp; Co. like to entertain with unsettled -- and unsettling -- riffs on fellas (the terribly lame ""Step Brothers"" the better ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"") no male director does female characters in big comedies better than Judd Apatow. At times theres an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" quality to the joke grab. But it works. When Gamble and Hoitz go out for a night of drinking the film shifts to a visually ludicrous Madison Avenue aesthetic. And Gambles backstory confession is so patently absurd it bumps the film into classic comedy turf. Is the character Gator a wink at Samuel L. Jacksons indelible ""Jungle Fever"" role? Who knows? Could be. This film goes everywhere. The movies final credits work like an attractive Powerpoint presentation of the failed economics of a go-go take-take market in which the citizenry the working stiffs with vulnerable pensions and humble dreams bailed out the overcompensated and underregulated. (Theyre worth staying for.) Were not sure we want this sort of lesson delivered from the likes of overly compensated film types any more than we want the lovely ladies of ""Sex and the City 2"" schooling us on feminism and Islam but we get the picture We the people are ""the other guys."" Its not bad company to be in. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/ madmoviegoer ""The Other Guys.""

"The Other Guys movie review Just silly enough |       NJ.com comments The Other Guys movie review Just silly enough Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 06 2010 at 830 AM View/Post Comments Macall Polay Mark Wahlberg right gets a grip on his partner Will Ferrell in ""The Other Guys."" You know those guys you always see in cop movies hanging onto the hoods of speeding cars a service revolver blazing in each hand a quip just waiting on the tip of their tongues? Well these are ""The Other Guys."" The cop who spends his entire day typing up other cops reports. The cop who became a laughingstock after -- well I wont spoil the joke but trust me he deserves it. A couple of losers. Who decide when a high-finance guy is kidnapped that maybe this is their time to be heroes. Or well maybe not. Because this is a Will Ferrell movie and that means were about to get an hour and a half of that-is-so-gay jokes oddly arbitrary pop-culture references sexual details youd probably be happier not thinking about and people behaving of course like idiots. Luckily for Ferrell and us its still a step up from his recent run of moron movies. Partly thats because longtime collaborator Adam McKay has some decent jokes this time -- and far more of them than he had in ""Step Brothers"" their last on-screen outing. A better visual sense too (the first few minutes bring on Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson for a fairly accurate parody of current action films). That Samuel L. is dropping by at all is another sign of one of the movies virtues a solid cast. The under-used Michael Keaton has a good part as the doltish duos captain. Mark Wahlberg is Ferrells hair-trigger partner and Eva Mendes is Ferrells wife. (Dont worry for once that cliched princess-and-the-frog casting is a joke the movies in on.) Typically though its when ""The Other Guys"" tries to copy other cop movies -- instead of simply satirizing them -- that it begins to go wrong. The big chase that climaxes the film is nearly endless. The crime that drives the story (some Ponzi scheme involving international terrorists) takes up far too much time and exposition. Movie Review The Other Guys (PG-13) Columbia (108 min.) Directed by Adam McKay. With Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains strong language drug and sexual references and violence. TWO AND A HALF STARS McKay and Ferrell dont seem to understand that this sort of plot device -- the MacGuffin in Hitchcock-speak -- is a detail no one in the audience ever takes seriously. Yet the filmmakers take it extremely seriously even ending their movie with an Al-Gore-style bar-graph presentation on Wall Street bailouts and bloated corporate pay. Because you know those Trappist monks out in Hollywood never get cushy tax breaks or pay themselves too much. Still preaching aside the whole thing is clearly Ferrells best comedy since ""Anchorman"" (although once you start remembering the films in between you see what faint praise that is). There are a few decent laughs Wahlberg is game as Ferrells straight-man partner and Keaton even occasionally gets that old mad glint in his eye. That doesnt in this economy make it a prime destination movie well worth two tickets and a box of popcorn. But for a stupid summer comedy itll do. And measured against this years other police farce -- remember ""Cop Out""? -- it looks absolutely heroic.

You can imagine what happens when they get a big case. Starring Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Eva Mendes Director Adam McKay Release Opened Aug 6 2010  Editorial Review Ferrell and Wahlberg go old-school on usBy Michael OSullivanFriday August 13 2010""The Other Guys"" takes stuff that as a rule isnt particularly funny and tries to make you laugh. More often than not it succeeds. A crooked financial adviser as the villain? Not funny. Not these days. Except as played by Steve Coogan who brings a squirrelly charm to the role of David Ershon a Bernie Madoff-style bad guy whose financial chicanery is the focus of the investigation in this comedy about a pair of wildly mismatched cops played by Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. Ferrell unsurprisingly does most of the heavy lifting. As Allen Gamble an embarrassingly nebbishy police accountant hes the geeky yin to Wahlbergs hyper-macho yang represented by Terry Hoitz a disgraced former hot shot who has been exiled to desk duty after an accidental shooting. Again not funny. Except that it is especially the identity of the victim. Gamble in ""The Other Guys"" is Hoitzs punishment. And were the ones who reap the rewards. Most of the comedy consists of Gamble doing uncool things firing his gun inside the station listening to the Little River Band driving a Prius. (Yes I know thats cool in some precincts. Not here.) As his reluctant partner Wahlberg proves himself a master of the slow burn. Hes our glowering stand-in the angry straight man to Ferrells earnest unhinged idiot. Why is the mere sight of Ferrell singing morbidly depressing folk songs in a bar funny? If you have to ask you must never have seen ""Old School"" ""Elf"" or ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (or any of the actors brilliantly lowbrow previous work). Almost anything Ferrell does is funny even if its stupid. Especially if its stupid. And theres plenty of stupid in ""The Other Guys."" Thats because more than anything what its making fun of is dumb cop-movie cliches. The title itself presents Gamble and Hoitz as alternatives to even bigger jerks played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. As supercops Danson and Highsmith theyre what Gamble and Hoitz aspire to become even after the film dispenses with the flashy high-wire duo in a gloriously ignominious -- and hilarious -- end. Their demise which comes early in the film opens up an opportunity for Gamble and Hoitz who spend the rest of the film competing with two other ambitious officers (Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.) to fill the void in the limelight left by Danson and Highsmith. As Gamble and Hoitz figure it if they can just solve one big case theyll be the new stars. When the film works best it does so by subverting our own expectations of the detective genre. After an exploding fireball throws Gamble and Hoitz to the ground they dont jump up unscathed and brush themselves off. Far from it. ""I just want to go somewhere and breast-feed"" whines Gamble writhing in pain. As the hard-boiled police captain Mauch Michael Keaton has the stereotype down -- except he keeps quoting TLC lyrics and moonlights as the manager of a Bed Bath amp; Beyond. If the movie doesnt work so well its because it occasionally stops tweaking convention and starts following it. At times -- especially during the films frequent car chases and shootouts -- ""The Other Guys"" looks and sounds too much like one of the movies its mocking. And certain running gags are run into the ground. Gamble for example is an incongruous (and clueless) sex symbol. Although his wife (Eva Mendes) is in Hoitzs words ""scalding hot"" Gamble appears unaware of this fact let alone that every other woman in the film also seems to want him. Its crazy -- hes Will Ferrell for Gods sake -- not to mention crazy funny. But the joke wears thin after the umpteenth iteration. Other dumb bits that outlast their welcome The bad guys keep taking Gambles and Hoitzs shoes and Mauch confiscates Gambles gun making him carry a wooden facsimile. For the most part ""The Other Guys"" is seriously silly stuff in the best sense. If you sit through the closing credits youll not only see an amusing outtake but a series of on-screen graphics that detail how a Ponzi scheme works as well as other disheartening statistics about the recent financial meltdown. Its a bizarre coda to a comedy but maybe thats the point. Instead of riling us up about runaway executive compensation and TARP funds it only serves as a reminder of how badly we could all use a good laugh nowadays.Contains pervasive crude language sexual humor brief sensuality gunplay vehicular mayhem and assorted comic violence.

( ) Wall Streeters are a bunch of overpaid ripoff artists says the guy who earned 20 million or so for ""Land of the Lost."" ""The Other Guys"" starts out as a hilarious take on cop-movie cliches then turns into Will Ferrells own ""Capitalism A Love Story."" The evident ire of the movies tax-code-dull second half suggests motives deeply personal. Maybe Will doesnt like his ranking in Forbes current list of Hollywoods Most Overpaid Stars which is No. 1? With his pay equal to 1 for every 3.29 his films take in hes a sort of box-office Bernie Madoff. Ferrell teams with Mark Wahlberg an NYPD desk jockey aching for a piece of the macho-man action owned by their supercop colleagues (Dwayne Johnson and a priceless Samuel L. Jackson). Allen (Ferrell) would rather stay put and work up a nice scaffolding-permit fine. He got into policing because he was attracted by the paperwork. ""At age 11 I audited my parents. Believe me there were some discrepancies."" His idea of cutting loose is to cruise in his Prius while listening to the Little River Band. PHOTOS THE OTHER GUYS FILMING IN NY VIDEO THE OTHER GUYS MOVIE REVIEW PHOTOS DEREK JETER FILMS A CAMEO IN THE OTHER GUYS Wahlberg isnt a comic (why couldnt Jack Black or John C. Reilly have taken this part?) and his button-eyed scowling doesnt make him work as a straight man either. Yet there are several superb riffs in the early going such as a couple of ""Lethal Weapon"" spoofs and a fight that breaks out at a funeral where the cops roll around belting each other on the floor -- silently so as not to be disrespectful. Some of the best gags depend on sharply executed surprise appearances including one by a top athlete and another by Eva Mendes. We learn its possible to dance sarcastically that a lion might have to bow in defeat to a really determined tuna that you can become a pimp accidentally and that true love can spring from unlikely places such as a case of rectal poison ivy. Michael Keaton is the funniest hes been in years as a police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath amp; Beyond. My comedy NASDAQ was on fire. Then the movie pulled a Lehman brothers. Three and a half stars. Three. Two and a half. My God could this thing tank all the way to two? Gags start to be repeated and the least funny ones seem to pop up the most. ""I want to fly like a peacock"" Wahlberg keeps saying. For some reason. The movie directed by Adam McKay from a script he wrote with Chris Henchy forgets its a comedy and starts burrowing into a convoluted but uninteresting financial scandal involving an evil capitalist played by Steve Coogan. If Coogan has ever been funny in any American movie Ive missed it. Scene after scene delves into bookkeeping details. Crickets chirp. Centuries pass. Then there are slapdash car chases and shootouts. Why exactly does everyone wind up on the driving range at Chelsea Piers? And why is this funny? ""The Other Guys"" is the first disappointment from the previously golden Ferrell-McKay team that delivered ""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers."" Now blowing studio money on political posturing they break laws known to every open-mike night novice by wrapping up with their least funny preachiest material A series of graphics illustrating financial-crisis stats meant to inflame the dudgeon of populists editorial writers and other financial illiterates. Sorry guys The Madoff Ponzi scheme has nothing to do with CEO-to-janitor compensation ratios and neither has anything to do with the financial crisis or TARP bailouts -- which anyway turned out to be astute loan backstops and bargain stock purchases. You see that being a bore is contagious. Ferrell on Wall Street is about as wince-worthy as Timothy Geithner on a NASCAR track running wild in his tighty whities. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next School of hard drugs in Twelve Read Next School of hard drugs in Twelve Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 45878 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 24537 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 14723 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Other Guys The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; other-guys-the ) Other Guys The (United States 2010) August 04 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Will Ferrells recent resume isnt anything to get excited about Land of the Lost Step Brothers Semi-Pro Blades of Glory. Theres a sameness to all of them not only in that the Ferrell characters are difficult to differentiate from one another but that the comedy is tired and tepid. Fortunately The Other Guys has a better grip on whats funny exhibits solid comedic timing and is generally more entertaining than tedious. Director Adam McKay has a stronger sense than some directors about how to best employ Ferrells likeability and cluelessness (his two most disarming on-screen characteristics). McKay started with Ferrell on Saturday Night Live and followed him to the big screen directing one of the actors most consistently amusing feature endeavors Anchorman. (Although to be fair he was also responsible for Step Brothers.) The underlying conceit of The Other Guys is pregnant with potential follow the misadventures of a couple of peons who exist in the shadow of big-time action heroes. Its like a Batman movie that tracks one of Commissioner Gordons underlings. Also the filmmakers dont overplay their hand. Once they have milked the idea for maximum comedic value they switch up things. As with many action-comedies this one expends a little too much running time on narrative and the comedic momentum flags during the final half hour as the more traditional action elements heat up en route to a finale. Still The Other Guys is funnier and more energetic than anything Ferrell has produced in quite some time. The big heroes are NYPD media hogs and daredevils Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson). Take the biggest action heroes from any cop movie up the machismo and intensity tenfold (as appropriate for a parody) and you get these two who preen like peacocks and think nothing of doing millions of dollars of damage to complete a minor drug bust. Unfortunately theyre not too bright and they think of themselves as invulnerable. When an incident corrects that misconception someone has to step into the breach. The least likely candidates for the job are police accountant Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and his partner Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Allen has no desire to go into the field but Terry who has anger management issues cant wait to get back. He has been deskbound since earning his nickname ""The Yankee Clipper"" after accidentally winging Derek Jeter before a game of the World Series. Allen and Terry immediately become embroiled in a big-time fraud case but the object of their investigation David Ershon (Steve Coogan) is so well-connected that their captain ex-baseball manager Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) tries to reel them in. Meanwhile in true buddy film fashion the mismatched partners begin to bond although Terry cannot believe a square like Allen is married to a gorgeous woman like Dr. Sheila Gamble (Eva Mendes). The films first 15 minutes are by far the most fun (and could be the best quarter-hour of any movie released this year) with Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock letting it all hang out. Jackson screams and shouts one-liners the way he hasnt done since all those fuckin snakes got on the fuckin plane. Is there anyone better at knowing self-parody than this man? The Rock meanwhile channels Arnold Schwarzenegger from Last Action Hero. Once these two are out of the picture it becomes a lower-key straightforward action-comedy but McKay and Ferrell are smart enough to keep the set pieces fresh and diverse. Some like Terrys befuddlement with Sharons hotness are effective while others like Sharons mother playing the go-between are less likely to provoke laughter. Comedic timing as in the ""Jersey Boys"" snippet or the instance when a man tries to fly is paramount. For the most part the jokes have punch lines which is too rarely the case in big-budget comedies. The Ferrell/Wahlberg matching is not among the screens most inspired pairings. The two lack chemistry and Wahlbergs capabilities as the ""straight man"" are dubious (although his reaction to the choice of the Little River Band as ""psych music"" is priceless). Aside from his recent supporting role in Date Night Wahlberg hasnt done much comedy concentrating his performances in the thriller and/or drama arena and the lack of experience occasionally shows in The Other Guys. Nevertheless the responsibility for being funny rests on the shoulders of Ferrell and for the first time in several years he is up to the task (with more than a little help from Jackson and Johnson).

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe The Other Guys Will Ferrell Grows Up His new comedy The Other Guys gives Will Ferrell a measure of maturity thats no less weird -- or funny By Richard Corliss Monday Aug. 16 2010 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Macall Polay / Columbia TristarDetective Allen Gamble calls the shots the star gets made over as a grownup Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Will Ferrell became a star by incarnating a hallowed movie character the big (6 ft. 3 in.) baby. He was Santas overgrown helper in Elf a figure of preening immaturity in his sports comedies (Kicking amp; Screaming Talladega Nights Blades of Glory Semi-Pro) and as one of the Step Brothers a run-amok 10-year-old in a 40-year-olds body. His version of our last President on Saturday Night Live and in the Broadway and HBO stand-up show Youre Welcome America A Final Night with George W. Bush portrayed a man stuck in bluster and emotional infancy. All these works hewed to a basic comedy premise -- id + idiocy = funny -- and locked Ferrell into a permanently arrested preadolescence. So its almost a shock to see him playing a semifunctioning adult in his new action comedy The Other Guys. His Allen Gamble a forensic accountant in the New York police department is no Will child; rather hes almost mulishly mild-mannered with a parsons forbearance and the temperament of a pocket calculator. He feels no need to run around topless; the obligatory Ferrell nude scene is missing here. Wild Will would stick his tush in someones face; but here Allen is on the butt end of humiliation and he takes it manfully as if he were so accustomed to chagrin that he could suppress or ignore it. Allens reluctance to explode is almost as weird as Other Wills inability to keep the lid on but it anchors him in the world of psychological compromise that for most adults counts as real life. (See pictures of buddy-cops in history.) His partner Terry (Mark Wahlberg) is true to the cop-movie dictum Allens polar possibly bipolar opposite. A fiery detective born to prowl mean streets collaring perps Terry has been rendered deskbound by his precinct captain (Michael Keaton) since the day when on a manhunt in the bowels of Yankee Stadium he accidentally gunned down Derek Jeter. (""You should have shot A-Rod"" one officer says.) No anger-management class can slake his itch for hard action. Hed love to be like the NYPDs star cops Highsmith and Danson (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson in cool-dude cameos) whod still be catching killers and demolishing most of Manhattan if they hadnt in a reprise of the first scene from Kick-Ass taken their superhero status too literally and jumped off a skyscraper roof to their deaths. So when Allen finds a case of tax evasion involving one David Ershon (Steve Coogan) a Bernie Madoff type with an English accent Terry joins the chase. It descends into quite a labyrinth threading through African zillionaires Australian goons and the Patrolmens Benevolent Association. The elaborate plot and the care lavished on car chases and crashes are two clues that director Adam McKay and his co-writer Chris Henchy dont just love parodying cop movies. They love cop movies. Multiple Sarcasms McKay who was with Ferrell in his SNL days also directed the stars best comedies Anchorman and Talladega Nights plus Step Brothers. He knows the key to Ferrells appeal as well as anyone; he must also have seen it was time for a makeover. McKay and Henchy give Allen a backstory that includes a college extracurricular in pimping as well as salvation by a gorgeous physician (Eva Mendes) who married him and still adores him -- a passion as unaccountable as it is quite admirably unexplained. Terry too has a clouded past. In a furious confrontation with his dancer ex-girlfriend (Lindsay Sloane) he suddenly performs a spectacular pirouette later telling Allen he learned ballet as a kid to mock the sissies. (Allen ""You learned to dance like that sarcastically?"") Its one of the joys of a film with no ambition other than to entertain that it leaves its knottier impulses to our imagination. Like too many comedies these days The Other Guys has a studiously ugly slapdash look as if to warn the audience not to expect a finely crafted film. And there are sections in which scene to scene the movies IQ drops by double digits. The heroes do something stupid like giving the evidence theyd accumulated over to the bad guys lawyer then explain it away. (""We just gave all our evidence over to the bad guys lawyer."") But like some silly summer song that cant be shaken from the mind this is a catchy enterprise no better than it tries to be and no less funny. See the Cartoons of the Week.

"The Other Guys Officer theres a dead horse in my movie | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Other Guys Officer theres a dead horse in my movieThe Other Guys a buddy-cop comedy pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg takes old jokes to tedious extremes. It should be a lot funnier.Mark Wahlberg left and Will Ferrell star in The Other Guys  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 5 2010The Other Guys(out of 4)Starring Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Michael Keaton Eva Mendes and Steve Coogan. Directed by Adam McKay. At major theatres. 107 minutes. 14ADead horse meet floggers.Make that meet yet again. The abiding philosophy of funnyman Will Ferrell and his directorial accomplice Adam McKay is that that any joke worth cracking is worth pounding into the pavement.Article Continued BelowThe Other Guys a buddy-cop comedy pairing Ferrell with Mark Wahlberg takes this nag-flailing fault to extremes. It should be a lot funnier than it is and it would be if the jokes had been as smart as the casting.We get infinite variations of sexist and homophobic humor involving a dumb guy (Wahlberg) and a really dumb guy (Ferrell). That gag about a Prius being a womans car? Its hilarious the first time so lets tell it 10 more times. The rude jibe about Ferrells urination technique? Positively epic and so is the repeat factor.None of this would really matter if The Other Guys didnt have considerably more promise than most such movies the wretched Cop Out being the recent low-water mark. When Ferrell and McKay are on their game as they were with Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy and two other movie collaborations they combine slapstick and satire to frequently uproarious effect.But Anchorman was set in the 1970s allowing us to mock an entire decade of insanity while The Other Guys exists in the supposedly more enlightened 21st century. The conceit that the New York Police Department is overrun with violent jocks and stumbling cretins isnt quite so hilarious anymore if only because its been done so many times before (see dead horse above).Ditto for chase scenes on crowded city streets where millions of dollars of property are smashed blown up set on fire and shot full of bullets yet no innocent bystander sustains as much as a scratch. McKay knows hes buying into movie cliches because he weakly mocks the ""magic explosion"" trope at one point but he cant (or wont) maintain his cynical edge.It didnt have to be this way when you look at the comic talent available. Ferrell actually has a strong character in Allen Gamble an NYPD accountant cop who would rather type up reports than collar bad guys. Hes joined at his desk with Wahlbergs trigger-happy Terry Hoitz who was grounded and given the mocking nickname ""Yankee Clipper"" following a bizarre ballpark incident another of the films running jokes. The excitable Wahlberg makes for a potentially good straight man for the dumbstruck Ferrell but McKay (who also co-wrote the film with Chris Henchy) doesnt fully exploit the relationship. Hes content to place them into increasingly dumb sketch-comedy situations hoping that something funny might happen while the firepower paid for by his big-studio budget explodes everywhere.Other characters are reduced to one-note performances and minor screen time. The showoff cops played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson who get the movie going with an amusing car pile-up not seen since The Blues Brothers would have provided greater balance and a real rooting interest when set against the Ferrell/Wahlberg ""other guys."" But they quickly fade into the background.Michael Keatons stiff-necked police captain and Steve Coogans scheming Wall Streeter might also have worked better had the script offered them anything more than simply mugging for the camera or repeating jokes that werent funny the first time around. Eva Mendes manages to escape the satirical shackles in her role as Ferrells long-suffering wife. She provides the inspired lunacy that is missing in most of the picture especially in a scene where Mendes dead-pans singing the goofy love tune ""Pimps Dont Cry"" to her depressed hubby.More of this would have made The Other Guys far less predictable but its clear that McKay and Ferrell really didnt know what they wanted to do. The supposed main plot about an investment scam goes absolutely nowhere and the movie ends on a far too serious note as various real-life robber barons are finger-pointed behind the credits while the righteous rockers of Rage Against the Machine wail on the soundtrack.The funniest thing of all is thinking that McKay and Ferrell might have preferred to make a documentary expose about evil capitalists rather than yet another dead-horse cop comedy.Read more about Will FerrellThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Thats not a complaint you understand. Id turn out for a movie that followed her around Milwaukee. And this movie eventually grows into something delicate and intriguing a midlife romance that may or may not be consummated. But Ms. Clarksons performance as Juliette the fashion-writer wife of a United Nations functionary is the films reason for being. She makes yearning palpable. She turns mysterious silences into a language of love. ENLARGE Alexander Siddig and Patricia Clarkson in Cairo Time. IFC Films Juliette states her purpose in coming to Cairo with her first words ""Im here to see my husband"" she tells an Egyptian customs officer. Then Ms. Naddas minimalist script announces its intentions with a plot device. Her husband Mark isnt there--hes stuck in Gaza dealing with an uprising. But Mark has sent his former security officer a tall dark and dangerously handsome melancholic named Tareq (Alexander Siddig) to meet Juliette at the airport and take her to her hotel. Thats the beginning of a leisurely traveloguey tease. The longer Mark stays in Gaza the more sights Juliette and Tareq get to see--the Pyramids despite her promise to save them for a visit with her husband plus belly dancing bad traffic the citys souks the eternal Nile and the surreal chalk formations of the White Desert. (Luc Montpellier did the handsome cinematography.) And the more sights they see the closer they come to noticing what weve seen all along that theyre a couple trying to behave like decorous acquaintances. ""Cairo Time""--the title evokes a languorous rhythm of life that Juliette resists and then accepts--demands patience even forbearance. Notwithstanding the expansive scenery its a small-scale production that takes several odd and tentative turns and often threatens to become a one-woman show even though the Sudan-born Mr. Siddig is a skillful actor and an appealing presence. (When Juliette says she has always wanted to go to Alexandria Tareq replies dryly ""You know the library burned down.) Still the Canadian filmmaker Ms. Nadda has an admirable fondness for ambiguity which complements her stars gift for subtle revelation. Ive been an unabashed fan of Ms. Clarkson ever since I saw her more than a decade ago in ""High Art"" playing Greta a German cokehead with Dietrichs voice and Fassbinders name on her lips. She was wonderful as the grief-stricken painter in ""The Station Agent""; as the droll world-weary mother in ""Pieces of April""; as the gravely tender physician in ""Lars and the Real Girl"" (which took place north of Milwaukee). Watching her in ""Cairo Time"" I thought back to ""Summertime"" the 1955 David Lean melodrama with Katharine Hepburn as another middle-age American tourist a lonely spinster hoping wistfully and fearfully to find romance in Venice. Faithful to the genre as well as the period Ms. Hepburn played her role with unconcealed and affecting passion. Ms. Clarkson takes a different approach. Instead of emphasizing Juliettes loneliness she conceals it as best she can. Instead of acknowledging her characters ardent desire for love and intimacy she withholds it like a top-secret eyes-only text. In a candidly retro romance hers is a quintessentially modern performance minimalist in style and maximalist in impact. See a clip from the new film ""The Other Guys"" starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Video courtesy of Columbia Pictures. The Other Guys Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are hapless cops and mismatched buddies in ""The Other Guys"" a summer movie that honors summer-movie conventions with a vengeance. Its loud raunchy semicoherent and stuffed to the bursting point with heavy weaponry and car chases most of which involve a red cocaine-covered Prius thats been pressed into service as a police car. But Adam McKays comedy of chaos which he wrote with Chris Henchy can also be very funny albeit fitfully an extended riff on ""Law amp; Order"" that is blessed with inventive wordplay in the sacred tradition of ""Airplane"" (Youd have to see it which wouldnt be torture at all to understand why the standard Miranda phraseology has been modified to ""Anything you do or say can be used as a flotation device."") Mr. Ferrell is Allen Gamble an underachieving detective whos genuinely devoted to doing paperwork and unaccountably attractive to gorgeous women Eva Mendes is his physician wife. Mr. Wahlberg is Terry Hoitz a former NYPD hotshot--and amateur ballet dancer--whose career turned cold when he shot Derek Jeter by mistake The Yankees shortstop plays himself. In the logic of the title the departments true hotshots are played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson while the other guys include losers like Allen and Terry. I cant reveal the nature of the sensational gag that features Messrs. Jackson and Johnson but I can tell you that it would make Alfred Hitchcock proud. ENLARGE Will Ferrell Steve Coogan and Mark Wahlberg in The Other Guys. Macall Polay In the past several years Mr. Ferrells feature career has careered like a Prius with unintended acceleration in reverse he starred in ""Land of the Lost"" which was execrable; in ""Step Brothers"" ditto; and in ""Blades of Glory"" which was better than bad but icicle-brittle and perilously thin. How nice then to see him back in form with a role that gives him a chance to display the gentleness--indeed the rueful gentleness--that distinguished his performance as the lovesick actor in Woody Allens ""Melinda and Melinda."" Mr. Ferrells Allen is a genuinely sweet guy as well as a crazed one As evidence his time-out for a surreal folk ballad along with his mad reminiscence about being a pimp in college. (Jon Brion did the music which includes the lullaby ""Pimps Dont Cry."") Mr. Wahlberg provides counterpoint to his co-stars nuances by declaiming his lines at the top of his voice here again the results can be hilarious when they arent silly. Michael Keaton is a police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath amp; Beyond. Steve Coogan a reliably funny actor isnt funny as a bad guy scheming to defraud the city. He seems to think hes in a drama. Watch a clip from the new film ""Flipped."" Video courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Flipped I cant say anything nice about ""Flipped"" a painfully clumsy adaptation of a tween novel by Wendelin Van Draanen. But I cant say nothing at all since the film was directed by Rob Reiner who has done enough good work in the past to make us care about what hes up to now. (In the increasingly distant past ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Stand By Me"" came out a quarter-century ago.) The screenplay written by Mr. Reiner and Andrew Scheinman uses extensive voice-over passages to reproduce the structure of the book and presents parallel accounts of a love that grows however erratically between a boy named Bryce and a girl named Juli in a sanitized American suburb during the middle of the last century. That use and abuse of voice-over--relentlessly monotonous and pitilessly repetitive line readings monitored by a director with a tin ear--is the first disastrous choice but not the only one. Minutes seem like hours as the narratives dawdles and stalls how much can a moviegoer care about a science project or the dark side of a ""Leave It to Beaver"" family that doesnt have a bright side worth a second glance? For the record Juli calls her science project ""A Chicken Is Born."" The film could be called ""An Egg Is Laid.""

"Movie review The Other Guys - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FunnyMovie review The Other GuysThe comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg is funny and clever. Just dont think too hard.August 06 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There is something so richly subversive so vicariously appealing about turning accountants into action heroes who aim their big guns at Wall Street Ponzi schemers that the idea alone makes the new buddy-cop comedy ""The Other Guys"" clever and funny from the first frame. Fortunately many other clever and funny frames follow. Which is nice to be able to say about a Will Ferrell comedy again after a recent string of duds capped (hopefully tighter than a BP oil well) by the dismal ""Land of the Lost"" in 2009. This latest gambit stars Ferrell as Det. Allen Gamble a NYPD forensic accountant and Mark Wahlberg as his rogue cop partner a reluctant and raging Terry Hoitz. These flat-footed flatfoots get lots of razzing from the other boys in blue but in typical dont-count-Ferrells-underachievers-out fashion they just might derail a 32-billion stock market rip-off if they can follow the paper trail and stop bickering long enough to figure it out. The film is directed by the actors long-time comic co-conspirator Adam McKay (they did among others 2006s ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" one of the best Ferrell funnies). McKay shares writing credit with Chris Henchy another longtime compadre and one of the responsible parties for said bad ""Land of the Lost."" But here the filmmakers are in fine fettle which goes a long way to make much of the low-brow silliness and slapstick infectious. The plot doesnt always hold water and it has a tendency to ramble but they dont seem to care. And honestly neither should you. The film has enough hard-core action and truly funny bits to keep boredom at bay starting with the incident that has left Hoitz in disgrace Hes the Jeter shooter as in he clipped beloved Yankees superstar Derek Jeter by mistake basically a hanging crime in the Big Apple. The departments resident superstars are detectives Danson and Highsmith played by Dwayne ""We Cant Call Him The Rock Anymore"" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson respectively (and respectfully). They are responsible for the crushing metal-twisting rubber-burning street-screeching end to about a thousand cars. The duo blaze their way through the city fighting crime and losing criminals before jumping off the top of a skyscraper after yet another bad guy gets away in either a nod to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids famous escape or a handy device to get them out of the way so a new pair of heroes can step in. Even so a computer nerd and a Jeter shooter arent exactly the top candidates to fill those shoes. Its all Terry can do to get Allen out of one humiliation after another though recovering from the ""desk-pop"" incident is no walk in the park (Allen is tricked into firing his gun in the office; punishment is carrying a wooden replica of a revolver for a while). Terry a strangely manic Wahlberg finally resorts to kidnapping his partner at gunpoint to get him out of the office. Ferrells gangly body nerdy looks and carefully cultivated loser-ness all work to make his CPA cop a likely candidate to join the comics list of indelible characters. He does look unable to handle a gun. He does look like he would pick a Prius to drive. But he doesnt look like he would have a hot ER doctor for a wife in Eva Mendes who seems to be the well-endowed well-displayed body of choice these days. Ultimately though it is a world where shortcomings are assets and since Allen has the most hes the sun around which all ""The Other Guys "" other guys orbit. There is a lot of spinning going on including pension fund fraud; car chases; college girl pimping; shootouts; unruly bums who do unspeakable things in cars; a Wall Street con artist (Steve Coogan) who does unspeakable things with cash; more shootouts more car chases. I could mention the trouble in Allens marriage; Terrys issues with his ex anger and ballet; and that all the bawdy blue language more than earns the PG-13 rating but youd probably just get impatient. What makes it all more interesting and much smarter than the above litany of high jinks and scoundrels might suggest is that there really is a message (possibly even a method) in all of McKay and Henchys screenwriting madness. If you havent caught on from all the jokes along the way they hit it again turning the final credits into a ""big guys"" versus the ""other guys"" running gag list of the many financial indiscretions weve collectively suffered at the hands of the Bernie Madoffs and AIGs of the world; a veritable catalog of all the Enrons and the end-runs. Which if you think of it is as both a sight gag and a sad gag; even a gag-able gag. But then ""The Other Guys"" doesnt actually want you thinking too hard. Now laughing? Well thats another matter. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review MegamindNovember 5 2010For Will Ferrell picking Megamind was a no-brainerOctober 31 2010In Wry Memoir a Screen Bad Guy Pulls Some PunchesJuly 31 2001SUMMER SNEAKS 94  If There Isnt a List It Isnt Sneaks...May 15 1994MORE STORIES ABOUTFunnyBig AppleCleverCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-other-guys-20100806,0,7134375.story",200,theotherguys16,theotherguys,latimes

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Other Guys  1/2 (out of four)Stars Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Eva Mendes Michael KeatonDirector Adam McKayDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language violence and some drug materialRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theyre mismatched and inept. If only they were consistently funny. The Other Guys is like a padded Saturday Night Live sketch. What would have been very funny for 15 minutes and pretty funny for 45 doesnt maintain the standard over the course of a feature-length film. MORE Eva Mendes is just one of the Guys TRAILER Spend a little time with the Guys The pairing of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg has its giddy moments but the buddy-cop parody suffers as it bogs down in unfunny police procedures and shoot-em-up action. Director Adam McKay has made two of the most inspired silly comedies in recent years starring Will Ferrell in the lead moronic roles Anchorman and Talladega Nights where Ferrell and John C. Reilly were ideally matched in wacky weirdness. But hes also responsible for Step Brothers an unfunny mess that re-teamed Ferrell and Reilly. What keeps The Other Guys out of that absurdly funny league is the drawn-out subplot about a white-collar crime conspiracy. Ferrell and Wahlberg are NYPD desk jockeys unlike a daring duo of cop superstars Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson). The heroic pairs exploits and clever sight gags kick off the film and set a raucous comic tone that the movie doesnt maintain. Ferrell plays mild-mannered Allen Gamble content as a pencil-pusher. Hes partnered with Wahlbergs Terry Hoitz a cocky screw-up who desperately wants his old beat back -- not to mention his gun and his mojo. Terry made a huge tactical error at a Yankees game making him a law enforcement pariah. Denied a patrol car they tool around in Allens tomato-red Toyota Prius. Its a hoot to see this small utilitarian vehicle careering around the streets of New York streaking after bad guys in elaborate chases like the little hybrid that could. Allen is not the milquetoast he seems. Flashbacks detailing his dicey past are some of the movies most outrageously funny scenes. His dangerous alter ego contrasts with his earnest psycho-babble nonsense like the need to ""climb over that anger wall."" Wahlberg is better as a straight man than as a fool. His jaw-dropping surprise when he meets Allens hot wife Sheila (Eva Mendes) makes for loopy fun. About halfway in the story begins to feel more like a hectic buddy-action movie than a satire of the genre. But Michael Keaton as a moonlighting precinct captain strikes just the right notes. The concept is rife with comic possibilities. But despite some inspired lunacy too many running jokes go amok.

(It has something to do with Hoitzs nickname the Yankee Clipper.)The face off is on the subject of lions and tuna and its totally loopy and moronic - and Ferrell and Wahlberg go at it with a fervor thats almost transcendentally absurd.But then there are the jokes and the riffs that just go kerplunk. And kerplunk . . . kerplunk . . . kerplunk - a virtual hailstorm of comedy misfires and shtick gone awry.McKay working with a crew of legit action aces (the credits are full of veterans from the Bourne movies) mounts Grand Theft Auto chases raging shootouts and elaborate jewelry heists that would do Jerry Bruckheimer proud. But thats part of the problem Theres so much energy and effort applied to the conventions of the genre - and to a white-collar crime scenario involving a Wall Street titan played by Steve Coogan - that it subsumes the stuff the filmmakers set out to mock.To wit Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson who appear early on as New York Citys celebrity crimebusters - a fearless and fearlessly profane duo who will stop at nothing not even the edge of a rooftop in their efforts to catch the bad guys. Their guns-a-blazin pursuit of a carload of perps is really no wilder or more ludicrous than what Agent Angelina gets up to on the streets of Washington D.C. in Salt.While most of The Other Guys focuses on Gamble and Hoitz and their initially cantankerous ultimately empathetic relationship Michael Keaton and Eva Mendes have work to do as do a hovering troupe of putative funny men (including Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.). Keaton is the no-nonsense departmental boss who moonlights at Bed Bath amp; Beyond and Mendes gamely sending up her screen persona has been cast as Gambles devoted va-va-voom wife.One of The Other Guys running gags is that Ferrells Gamble is inexplicably a babe magnet. Wahlbergs Hoitz for one cant get over it. The gag gets laughs at first but then they work it over a few times and a few times more until its been beaten to a bloodless pulp.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"The Other Guys Dont call it a Will Ferrell comeback. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Other Guys Dont call it a Will Ferrell comeback. The Other Guys Dont call it a Will Ferrell comeback. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 5 2010 715 PM The Other Guys Dont call it a Will Ferrell comeback. By Josh Levin Also in Slate Jessica Winter explains what The Other Guys director Adam McKay learned from Luis Bunuel and John Cassavetes. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in The Other Guys While Will Ferrell was off playing with dinosaurs Zach Galifianakis became the funniest man in America. Or if its not Galifianakis its Tracy Morgan or Seth Rogen or Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert all of whom now have more cultural cachet than the guy with the many leather-bound books. Its not that Ferrell has gotten less funny--its that no amount of comedy genius could salvage the miserably scripted Semi-Pro and Land of the Lost. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. In Ferrells defense those recent stinkers didnt feature his yang--former Saturday Night Live head writer (and Ferrells Funny or Die co-conspirator) Adam McKay who wrote and directed Anchorman Talladega Nights and Step Brothers. The minds behind ""I like to think of Jesus as a mischievous badger"" have reunited for the buddy-cop comedy The Other Guys (Columbia). Has Ferrell made a triumphant return? Not really. Despite the occasional dose of McFerrellian ridiculousness The Other Guys never hits the peaks of the duos previous collaborations--theres just a bit too much formula and not quite enough insane-asylum lunacy. Advertisement The Other Guys actually suffers by comparison to its own madcap opening sequence. The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson storm through the first two scenes as Danson and Highsmith a pair of sexually voracious trigger-happy lawmen who blow up the Trump Tower to catch a perp and party with Brody Jenner Bai Ling and that ""little short bitch from Jersey Shore."" The Other Guys quickly and very funnily kills off the hero cops shifting our focus to the movies bumbling protagonists the straight-laced oversize-glasses-wearing Little River Band-loving Gamble (Ferrell) and the violence-prone loose cannon Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). When you pull that switcheroo the heroes you shove into the spotlight better be more interesting than the ones you dangle in front of us and then yank away. To see how its done watch Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. The Other Guys by contrast shows what happens when a movie is too willing to trade its vitality for a big early laugh. Left alone Ferrell and Wahlberg struggle with the constraints of a well-worn genre. What happens when a mild-mannered accountant and an insult-heaving hothead try to put the screws to a rapacious scheming capitalist (Steve Coogan)? Pretty much what youd expect including the car chases. With The Other Guys comedy kingpin under wraps as a strait-laced ""paper bitch"" McKay et al. needed to give the less yuk-inducing Wahlberg the gift of better lines. But Wahlberg doesnt say anything memorable the entire movie perhaps on account of the movies PG-13 rating--his tough-talking cop in The Departed was a lot more fun to watch thanks to the 50 different ways he had to say Go fuck yourself. By the time Ferrell sheds his tie and gets manic the movies formula has gotten a little too stale to salvage. In fairness to McKay and Ferrell their movies are properly evaluated less as coherent narratives than as sequences of quotable nuggets. Even so The Other Guys has too few quotable moments--Im partial to Ferrells inspired rant about how a pack of tuna could stalk and devour a pride of lions--to fill the gaps between the big laughs which are yawning compared to Anchorman and Talladega Nights. One big reason for this deficiency is that the supporting cast doesnt offer enough support after Danson and Highsmiths untimely passing--Eva Mendes just stands around looking pretty while Michael Keatons captain does little else besides unintentionally quoting songs from the TLC back catalog. At times The Other Guys cop cliches get shoved aside for a critique of the financial world as Coogans slimy Bernie Madoff clone defrauds his investors of 32 billion. Strangely the movie saves its sharpest critiques for the closing credits when a series of slick charts and graphs detail how Ponzi schemes work how the ratio of CEO-to-employee salaries has skyrocketed and how much AIG executives have received in bonus payouts. If it was a little more ambitious The Other Guys couldve been the funniest episode of Planet Money ever. Instead its just another cop comedy. Watch a scene from The Other Guys Like Slate on Facebook.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + It was depressing watching Mark Wahlberg pretend to be awake for the gunfights and explosions in ""Max Payne. It was excruciating to see him look so overmedicated in ""The Lovely Bones. And it was absolutely inhumane to make us watch him talk to plants in ""The Happening. The only upside was a couple of very funny ""Saturday Night Live sketches in which Andy Samberg spoke to real animals using Wahlbergs sweaty whisper.Wahlberg of course has been funny in his own right (see his existentialist fireman in ""I Heart Huckabees or his humorless detective in ""The Departed). But with any luck 2010 will be the year he gets to stay that way. In the spring he and his bare torso pilfered a few scenes in ""Date Night and today he stuffs an entire movie down his pants. ""The Other Guys sticks him with Will Ferrell but what seems like another desperate adventure in stunt casting turns out to be a combustible comic bounty.As NYPD detectives trying to solve a case involving a corrupt financial titan (Steve Coogan) Wahlberg and Ferrell take turns letting the other lose control. Speaking only comedically who in this relationship is the straight man?Ferrells Allen Gamble likes his desk job. The pushing of paper and picking of nits satisfies his nerdy nature. Street crime doesnt interest him. Thats precisely where his partner Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) wants to be. Hoitz is a blunt hothead with an itchy trigger finger. He screams at Gamble for depriving him of the action he so desperately wants. But once they do hit the streets and start cracking the case theyre a disastrous misalliance. Expensive for New York but easy summer entertainment for us.Wahlberg erupts all over Ferrell who tries to sit and take it until he no longer can. In an early scene Wahlberg lays into Ferrell telling him if he were a lion and Ferrell were a tuna hed swim into the ocean to tear him apart. Wahlbergs keyed-up delivery in this scene has both a touch of madness and hilarious only-child entitlement. Ferrell picks up on the brattiness of Wahlbergs tirade and sets out to embarrass him. His matter-of-fact rebuttal becomes a sermon in which his tuna is more or less eating Wahlbergs lion.The comedy of the scene resides in a kind of suspense Will Wahlberg top Ferrell or concede? Its unclear whether the cup of hot coffee Wahlberg then slings at his costar is one or the other. Either way thats funny too. The scene is a coming attraction for the shenanigans that follow. If their routine gets old its only because the movie is 20 minutes longer than it has any business being. ""The Other Guys is at its core a perceptive satire of the interpersonal boiling points in buddy-cop pictures. How Eddie Murphy knew just how to blow Nick Noltes or John Ashtons top. How it took Herculean self-indulgence on Mel Gibsons part to chafe Danny Glovers decency. The cliches of these relationships and the movies that featured them have been mocked in Edgar Wrights ""Hot Fuzz and Kevin Smiths lazy lousy ""Cop Out. But ""The Other Guys while not as well made as ""Hot Fuzz is better attuned to the hackneyed machismo of Hollywood cop movies of every stripe.It concocts a familiar world of movie precincts high in testosterone. In the opening minutes Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson play a pair of supercops who manage to cause millions of dollars in damage while saving the day. They star in press conferences and party with the likes of Brody Jenner Bai Ling and someone uncharitably described as a cast member from ""Jersey Shore. Both the city and the other cops worship them.Their arbitrary and hilariously sudden demise leads to a no-less-random sequence in which their fellow detectives fistfight at a funeral to replace them. Director Adam McKay who wrote the movie with Chris Henchy and is a frequent coconspirator and enabler of Ferrell (""Step Brothers and the joyous ""Talladega Nights) stages the fight in stage whispers lest anyone at the double funeral hear fisticuffs. (Michael Keaton is very good as the loosely exasperated captain.)Most of the cops here especially one played by Bobby Cannavale have the antic jumpy volatility of certain cokeheads. This is a movie that feeds that suspicion by having Ferrell and Wahlberg drive around Manhattan in a Prius powdered with cocaine. I dont know why its funny. More than anything its nonsense. But everything in this movie is. Hoitz busts in on an ex-girlfriend whos a dancer and proceeds to twirl like a ballerina (""You learned to dance like that sarcastically? Ferrell asks).Hoitz spends the movie shocked that Gamble is married to Eva Mendes -- here thats Dr. Eva Mendes -- who sings a song called ""Pimps Dont Cry to Gamble whose mild manner is apparently the result of an outrageous college life. That song also appears during the closing credits along with lots of outrageous statistics about the financial industry. Yes this is the only movie of the summer to come with its own Harpers Index and narration by Ice-T.The movie works because it feels like its two stars have something they need to get off their chests. Ferrell is experimenting with restraint. His partner clowns around with rage. Judging from his shirtlessness in ""Date Night and his short fuse here Wahlberg is trying to turn a corner. He knows hes a dish best served hot.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its a testament to Will Ferrells comic genius that his movies are any good at all. Ferrell isnt a satirist or an observational humorist and he isnt comfortably confined within the guardrails of a script even a well-written one. His natural outlet is the sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live where his gift for digressive silliness could be packaged into five- or 10-minute bits. So a good Will Ferrell movie like the inspired buddy-cop comedy The Other Guys gloms together enough clever riffs and random funny business to overcome the inevitable lumpiness and dead ends. It helps that Ferrells regular collaborator director Adam McKay (Anchorman Talladega Nights Step Brothers) has a visual panache thats rare in Hollywood comedies and especially useful when shoot-outs and car chases come into play. Cop Out this aint. The bang-up opening sequence establishes the pecking order in the New York Police Department where a couple of meathead action junkies played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are the citys top cops winning plaudits in spite of their outrageously overzealous style. Meanwhile the other guys of the title are the desk jockeys. Their ranks include Ferrell (who happily bangs out police reports and accounting paperwork) and his belligerent partner Mark Wahlberg whos been riding the pine ever since he shot a local hero. Mostly by accident Ferrell and Wahlberg stumble into a huge white-collar case involving a British billionaire (Steve Coogan) and swindled investors but the risk-averse Ferrell doesnt easily take to the dangers of real detective work. Great casting takes The Other Guys most of the way Ferrell draws a wealth of good material from his characters oddball ineffectuality and he partners perfectly with Wahlberg whos always best at his most incredulous. In the role of their commander Michael Keaton finally gets a chance to return to the unhinged comedy of his early films and Coogan is appropriately oily as a preening moneybags-type who charms people with Broadway tickets and cucumber water. Some running gags get stretched to the breaking point like Ferrells unaccountable ability to attract hot women (Eva Mendes plays his wife) and a story from his past but McKay gives the film enough structure and style to keep the action moving. And as in the best Ferrell vehicles if a joke fails several disarming and original ones always follow in short order.

(Polay/Everett) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 5 2010 400 AM Title The Other Guys Action-comedy about inept NYPD detectives. With Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Eva Mendes. Director Adam McKay (147). PG-13 Crude humor sexuality language violence. At area theaters.Unimpeded by logic continuity or taste Will Ferrell movies run by a unique set of rules. Therefore the fairest way to judge them is as their own genre. By that standard ""The Other Guys"" falls somewhere in the middle not as smart as ""Old School"" or as silly as ""Anchorman"" but funnier than say ""Semi-Pro.""Ferrell does best when hes got someone to bounce off and Mark Wahlberg proves an unexpectedly strong straight man. The two play NYPD detectives Gamble (Ferrell) and Hoitz (Wahlberg). The former is a rigid accountant determined to do everything by the book; the latter is a hothead outraged that hes stuck at a desk just because he accidentally shot Derek Jeter.In time-honored fashion these mismatched partners have to prove themselves to their dismissive captain (Michael Keaton) and mocking colleagues (Rob Riggle Damon Wayans Jr.). They find the perfect case when a pair of corrupt investors (Anne Heche and Steve Coogan) turn out to have connections all the way up to the DAs office.Director Adam McKay and his co-writer Chris Henchy have fun spoofing 80s cop movies by outsizing every cliche they can think of. (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are especially amusing in too-brief cameos as the precinct hotshots.) But the formula allows the filmmakers to get lazy too relying on easy gags and repeated punch lines.Still there are as many hits as there are misses thanks to the dedication of both leads. Wahlberg is surprisingly committed to the ridiculousness whether expressing baffled envy when Gambles ""plain"" wife turns out to be Eva Mendes or stunned fury when Gamble brandishes a wooden gun.McKay -- whose other Ferrell films include ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" -- is also determined to give us high-octane action along with the lowbrow comedy. So ""Guys"" begins and ends with gratifyingly wild if suitably inane car chases. You may be surprised by how fast a Prius can fly.

"Other Guys a frustrating movie with a lot of laughs - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsOther Guys a frustrating movie with a lot of laughsWill Ferrell and company deliver a good hour of laughsAugust 05 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 1/2 stars A frustrating movie albeit one with a lot of laughs ""The Other Guys"" stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as New York Police Department desk jockeys who get a chance to transform themselves into high-risk maximum-destruction superstars chasing down a Bernie Madoff-type scam artist and destroying half their city in the process. For a good hour this is the picture Kevin Smith was trying to make with ""Cop Out."" Its satisfying to see Ferrell take on a more officious buttoned-down character (though with a checkered past); that way an actor has somewhere to go with his craziness as opposed to sustaining a boors boor as Ferrell did in ""Talladega Nights"" and his best comedy to date ""Anchorman."" And Wahlbergs comic instincts his slow- and quick-burning exasperation may not carry the subtlety of his superb supporting turn in ""The Departed"" but they more than meet the demands of this project. So why does it frustrate? Because Adam McKay and co-writer Chris Henchy ( ""Land of the Lost"") have overloaded the narrative stretching it 20 minutes beyond its practical use and mistaking bigger and more explosive with funnier. From ""Freebie and the Bean"" to ""Running Scared"" to the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise the challenge with cop-centric action comedies has remained essentially the same How to balance straightforward adrenaline-rush material with bits youd never find in a real cop film? This one begins buckling under its own weight around the midpoint; on the other hand Im already looking forward to catching certain asides and riffs again on cable. Early on Wahlbergs Detective Hoitz regales Ferrells Detective Gamble with an insult about a lion swimming out to sea to kill some tuna and Ferrells response -- a sustained act of literary criticism and literal-minded wind-baggery that grows weirder as it goes -- reminds you how amusing this guy really is. Another gag involves a brawl conducted almost entirely in whispers that breaks out at a police funeral. Lovely idea; strong execution. ""Is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?"" Ferrell sputters in another scene. Already were talking about more laughs than a lot of Ferrells previous vehicles. McKay and cinematographer Oliver Wood who shot all three ""Bourne"" films as well as ""Talladega Nights"" push the action as hard and fast as they can slamming most of the mayhem and dialogue in extreme close-up. Its a somewhat suffocating attempt at keeping the style close to what the movie occasionally gets around to satirizing. But size matters and as with the war-film goof ""Tropic Thunder"" you wonder if a smaller scruffier-looking version of the same movie would have yielded bigger comic payoffs. So a mixed bag worth sorting through for things like the tale of the lion and the tuna which barely makes sense as youre hearing it. Thats Ferrell for you a screen comic who is just enough of a real actor to sell the stupidest stuff with the straightest of faces. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for crude and sexual content language violence and some drug material) Cast Will Ferrell (Gamble); Mark Wahlberg (Hoitz); Eva Mendes (Sheila); Michael Keaton (Capt.

But comedy is a funny business. Even when its silly and bent a blast of pure popcorn goofiness it doesnt have to be just silly; it can express something quirky and resonant about the comedian in question -- and by extension about us. Will Ferrell took an unfair lashing last summer for Land of the Lost (the movie was bad but not nearly the catastrophe it was made out to be and Ferrell doing a naughty kiddie picture in the tradition of Elf had his moments). You can feel him react to the spanking he got from the media in the flair and ambition of The Other Guys a nerd-out-of-water destructo action comedy starring Ferrell as a New York police bureaucrat named Allen Gamble whos a ridiculously mild and persnickety fussbudget -- an eager nobody who works as a paper pusher and more than that likes it. The movie is as antic and raucous and fun as any of the stars previous screen outings only this one has a surprisingly personal flavor. Its Ferrells richest riff yet on the comedy of conflicted aggression. Allen has never fired a gun and doesnt want to; he has never walked a traffic beat. Hes the furthest thing from P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Dwayne Johnson) the two rapaciously dirty-minded bad-boy supercops who open the film with a nifty satiric lets-trash-the-city chase sequence. Instead Allen is one of the ""other guys"" the unheroic desk-jockey schlubs who stand around in the background clad in ugly plaid jackets. Within the locker-room atmosphere of the precinct house hes not a law enforcer. Hes not really a cop at all. The movie is about how this officious wimp with his pudgy-cheeked complacency and aviator-framed glasses gets shoved onto the streets and into the world of real guns and real crime. Mark Wahlberg plays his testy conventional roughneck partner Terry Hoitz who got sidelined and drew this short straw of a detective buddy because he had the misfortune of shooting New York Yankee Derek Jeter while on duty. The Other Guys is almost a recognizably gritty genre picture complete with bullet spray Sidney Lumet gunmetal lighting and a Wall Street villain (Steve Coogan) who embodies the sins of our time with a relative absence of cheek. All of that grounds the movie and makes it funnier. Not that Ferrell has left his surrealist-prankster side at home. The Other Guys gets you chuckling at the little details of Allens stick-up-the-butt patheticness like the way he hums while typing or argues with Terry about how a school of tuna could whip a lion or blasts Little River Band CDs in his sad dinky red Prius. (Terry ""I feel like were literally driving around in a vagina."") A few of the jokes are sly many are quite obvious but what knits the laughs together is the nearly confessional conviction with which Ferrell delivers them. Hes not playing just another geek idiot -- as say Rob Schneider does. He digs into some elemental side of himself a side that craves order and niceness and civility that shrinks from danger and violence. Allen is such a straight arrow that he might have stepped out of the 1950s; he doesnt even realize that his wife (Eva Mendes) is a total hottie. But thats also a tip-off that hes got a secret suppressed raunchy side a big-pimpin alter ego named Gator who starts to ooze out to uproarious effect as the movie goes on. Teaming up once again with director Adam McKay (Anchorman Talladega Nights) Ferrell makes Allen another of his classic divided personalities only now he draws back from caricature -- at least more than when he played a blowhard egomaniac like Ron Burgundy. In The Other Guys Ferrell cuts down on the stylized hysteria and he doesnt run around with his belly hanging out. As an actor hes closer here to Peter Sellers or the early Woody Allen; he does obsessive riffs on being an insanely cautious man in a culture that prizes control. Allen is a schmo who winds up in the middle of his own action thriller. When a bomb blows out a storefront he doesnt dive ahead of it hero-style -- he gets blasted and lies on the ground shouting ""I need an MRI Theres no way I dont have soft-tissue damage right now"" The Other Guys is aimed at all of us out there who long for excitement yet cling to safety because were more desk jockey than supercop ourselves. Its a comedy of manhood for the age of emasculation.

Its sneaky and smartly funny offering an almost perfect balance of action and comedy. The Other Guys Fair to good Director Adam McKay. Cast Will Ferrell Mark Wahlberg Eva Mendes Michael Keaton. Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language violence and drug material. Buddy cop flicks Spotlight Will Ferrell | Mark Wahlberg Thats the good news. Then theres the matter of the movies disheartening final 25 minutes. Like a speeding train thats slowly running out of steam the movie grinds to a halt. All cleverness and wit are tossed aside for shoot-em-up sequences that play like straight versions of what was just being spoofed. Its a shame considering how good the movie is most of the time. Its the fourth teaming for Will Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay. It may not be as consistent as ""Step Brothers"" but ""The Other Guys"" usually is funnier than ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" Ferrell more restrained than usual plays meek forensic accountant Allen Gamble. He drives around in a red Prius and blasts the mellow sounds of the Little River Band or ""LRB"" as he knowingly calls them. He partners with hotheaded cop Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) whos itching for some action outside the office. ""I am a peacock"" Hoitz tells his captain. ""You gotta let me fly"" Gamble and Hoitz stumble onto a multimillion-dollar scheme involving the New York Lottery and a British millionaire (Steve Coogan). This is where the movie begins to unravel; the caper is much too complex and convoluted for a comedic-action spoof. Initially McKay throws the audience disarmingly funny curves that distract from such plot deficiencies. Some are small bits such as Gamble earning his degree from the University of Phoenix and an Aussie tough guy (Ray Stevenson) announcing he has a thing for Kylie Minogue. Then come major plot points such as Gamble being unaware that hes married to a major sexpot played winningly by Eva Mendes. Such moments are where the movie really scores - the film goes off in such an unexpected direction that youre caught off-guard by how smart it is. McKays grandest moment is early on when he creates an outrageous sight gag involving a pair of top cops played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson. The moment is so over-the-top funny it creates considerable goodwill for what follows. Not enough to carry it through those final 25 minutes but considerable.

(This time with Mark Wahlberg.)Macall Polay A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - After obligatory helicopter views of New Yorks skyline open Adam McKays The Other Guys were introduced to Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) a duo of headline-grabbing unflappable supercops who keep the city exciting if not safe with law enforcement by the Michael Bay book.The Other Guys arent them. This is the fourth feature collaboration between McKay and Will Ferrell who make baggy improvisational comedies about utter boobs (Anchormans Ron Burgundy Talladega Nights Ricky Bobby) like Detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is an emasculated Prius owner transferred from forensic accounting who volunteers to do everyone elses paperwork so he can stay safely at his desk. Loose-cannon Hoitz seems to have been partnered with Gamble as punishment--hes been the departmental black sheep since a humiliating incident that earned him the nickname ""Yankee Clipper.""Laying out its premise The Other Guys is loose and funny. Michael Keaton is welcome as the captain; the classic cop-opera scene of a chest-thumping station-house brawl becomes a quiet six-inch-voices huddle at a solemn official event; and the fall from grace for the station idols is a giddy sight gag in an otherwise functionally shot movie.Dont expect Wahlberg to bring his compact cagey and deadpan sergeant from The Departed as straight man to the Ferrellian psycho--McKays operating principle is that if one idiot is funny two are hilarious. So Wahlberg is given to peevish hot-headed ranting in a breathy singsong while Ferrell playing supersquare still periodically lets loose to chase riffs until they collapse as when Gamble whips one of Hoitzs bad metaphors into a fervid monologue about fish-versus-lion combat.And for a while the gears catch. Hoitz comes over to his partners house and is floored by his is-she-really-going-out-with-him gorgeous wife (Eva Mendes). Ferrells boorishness at the dinner table (he insistently notes his wifes ""plainness"") Mendess domestic glow and Wahlbergs hypnotized puppy love make a tickling trio of mutually oblivious reactions. One wishes for more of these well-set-up scenes later as the leads are given little to do but trade off one-liners while treading the waters of an increasingly choppy plot.Gamble and Hoitz catch the scent of something big during a routine pickup of a Wall Street hustler (Steve Coogan) busted after a speech at ""The Center for American Capitalism."" Anyone who knows McKays wider body of work knows his political grievances--with G.W. impersonator Ferrell he bedeviled the Bush presidency on SNL on Broadway and online--but hes never really integrated them into his films beyond say the Red State turkey shoot of Talladega Nights. Taking white-collar criminals for villains The Other Guys isnt laugh-killingly self-righteous--the Rage Against the Machine over the closing credits is pretty funny actually--but its timely villain-cluttered conspiracy doesnt make for a very buoyant adventure story either.Following the clues The Other Guys turns more hectic than antic and somebody didnt pack enough comedy for this long trip--the punchlines in the movies second half are often callbacks to jokes you may not fondly remember from the first until every gag is united with its mate. (Whatever script there was is credited to McKay and Chris Henchy creators of the Funny or Die website with Ferrell.) If there were a computer program that automatically generated generic action scenes after you punch in participating actors names--and there may well be--the product would look like The Other Guys shoot-em-ups. Injections of zaniness (i.e. an enemy helicopter being pelted with golf balls; jokes about learning to drive from Grand Theft Auto) dont much lighten the impersonality.Does providing a half-dozen solid laffs put The Other Guys ahead of this summers grade curve? Afraid so. But comic cops are as old as the Keystone PD and you need something special to compete with the homemade ingenuity skewed Brit perspective and steady command of tone of recent memory Hot Fuzz not to speak of beating The Naked Gun to the draw.

After a season of coed action comedies ranging from ""Date Night"" to ""Knight and Day"" it figures Adam McKay would be the one to bring back the bromance milking the testosterone-fueled buddy-cop genre for touchy-feely fun in ""The Other Guys."" Starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as two paper pushers whod surely be sidelined in a traditional policer pic sets out with more of a plot than such previous McKay comedies as ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights."" That should push B.O. further but it also becomes the films undoing as the laughs ultimately take a backseat to a convoluted white-collar crime story. In keeping with previous Ferrell showcases ""The Other Guys"" identifies a character who could easily support a series of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches -- in this case milquetoast police accountant Allen Gamble (Ferrell) whose perky posture and contented smile reveal the intense satisfaction he takes from being a team player even if the closest he comes to the action is typing up case reports for star cops Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson). Weve seen variations on this too-naive-to-know-better routine from Ferrell before which makes Wahlberg the pics casting coup. As Terry Hoitz Wahlberg plays a screw-up whod give anything to be the sort of tough-guy hero the actor usually plays (where other pics have exploited Wahlbergs abs ""The Other Guys"" goes out of its way to make it look as if he gets by on an all-doughnut diet). Hoitz would probably be in the field too if it werent for a trigger-happy accident at a Yankees game. Hoitz sees his chance after a particularly overzealous stunt by Highsmith and Danson puts the spotlight-hogging cops out of commission with the desk jockey dragging his Prius-driving wooden gun-wielding partner Gamble into the fray. The pair hardly get along at first but the film doesnt exploit their differences for long preferring to concentrate on the mushier notion that their relationship matters. Yes theres a case to be solved but Gambles real mission as he tells hot-headed Hoitz is ""to climb over that anger wall of yours."" Just when things should be getting interesting their captain (Michael Keaton playing babysitter to a department of overgrown kids rounded out by Rob Riggle and Damon Wayans Jr.) separates the two. Putting more stock in their relationship than we do the pic serves up a mopey montage of the partners trying to make do without each other -- an uneven sequence that plays like something out of a romantic comedy. Luckily the two leads have a special kind of chemistry. With a few flamboyant exceptions (such as Hoitz insisting ""Im a peacock. You gotta let me fly"") Wahlberg is tasked with playing it straight while Ferrell is free to improvise at will. Theres more room for such comic latitude early in the film -- including a rowdy run-in with Gambles ex-girlfriend (Natalie Zea) and her emasculated new beau (Brett Gelman) -- but once the plot kicks in theres less opportunity for wayward jokes leaving the movie conspicuously less funny in the process. Watching Hoitz and Gamble butt heads theres little doubt a perfectly entertaining movie could be made without leaving the office but these characters are clearly not alone in their craving for some action. In a field dominated by Michael Bay types McKay qualifies as one of ""the other guys"" a director more given to orchestrating punchlines than pyrotechnics. Here he understandably seizes the opportunity to blow stuff up although it would be more accurate to say the opportunity overtakes him as the laugh-a-minute pace established in the first act downshifts into something more akin to a standard 80s buddy-cop movie (a la ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""48 Hrs."") once the procedural elements take hold. McKay and co-writer Chris Henchy may have set out to make a satire of such pics riffing on everything from the occasional ruminative saxophone solo to the obligatory character-grounding domestic scenes (in a recurring joke Eva Mendes plays Gambles impossibly hot wife). But the result could pass for one of those films assuming you can get past the tongue-in-cheek approach to every setpiece. McKay is obviously having a blast staging explosions chases and even an epic Mexican standoff (backed by ""Bourne"" producer Patrick Crowley and an all-pro crew the action looks aces); a pity that the pic bogs down in an unnecessarily complicated evil-investor plot. It was a clever choice to make the villain a slimy Wall Street racketeer (Steve Coogan) giving the film a chance to lob a few timely critiques at our current financial predicament. But that theme feels only half-baked (awkwardly resurfacing as a PowerPoint-style economics lesson over the end credits) while the mystery effectively forces Hoitz and Gamble into the shoes of competent cops more or less defusing the underlying beta-male concept that some guys simply werent born to lead.

Just when it seemed like the once-robust buddy-cop action-comedy was going to require a do-not-resuscitate order along comes Will Ferrell and Adam McKay to show em how its done. Having successfully collaborated with director-writer McKay several times in the past most notably on ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" Ferrell keeps the winning streak intact while drawing out Mark Wahlbergs untapped funny side in ""The Other Guys."" Although their yin-yang dynamic makes for the comic dream team of the summer they receive plenty of expert backup from Michael Keaton Eva Mendes Steve Coogan Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson. The ridiculously entertaining results should result in a sizable haul for the Columbia release which occupies the same early August slot as 2008s sleeper hit ""The Pineapple Express."" Not quite New Yorks finest Ferrell and Wahlberg are constantly overlooked Detectives Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz respectively. While nerdy Gamble is perfectly content with his forensic-accounting job intense Hoitz is itching to see real action instead of being left to clean up after stationhouse hotshots P.K. Highsmith (Jackson) and Christopher Danson (Johnson). Hoitz finally gets his wish when one of Gambles paper trails leads them to a big-time crime of Bernie Madoff proportions much to the continuing headache of precinct chief Capt. Mauch (a pitch-perfect Keaton) who supplements his tight income by moonlighting as a manager at a Bed Bath amp; Beyond. Nimbly blending comedy and action -- with an affectionate slo-mo nod to John Woo -- McKay does his best work to date here and though the picture could have benefited from a tighter edit theres no shortage of inspired sequences. Working from a flexible script he penned with Chris Henchy and evident input from Ferrell McKay also puts Wahlbergs trademark intensity to effective use here especially during a destined-to-be-a-classic sequence in which Ferrell brings him home to meet his ""plain"" ball and chain who much to Wahlbergs all-consuming incredulity turns out to be smoking-hot Mendes. Mendes -- who also can be heard cooing the catchy closing theme song ""Pimps Dont Cry"" with Gnarls Barkleys Cee-Lo -- is gamely appealing as are all the other guys in ""The Other Guys."" Speaking of the closing thanks to the implementation of eye-catching graphics and sobering factoids the films end credits crawl is anything but routine providing unexpectedly enlightening financial food for thought.
