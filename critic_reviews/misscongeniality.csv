Posted January 12 2001 -- 1200 AM EST In Miss Congeniality Sandra Bullock - one of todays most likable but least successfully developed marquee-caliber actresses - stars as a frumpy FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. This gender-stereotyped powder-puff comedy about the agony of women competing for tiaras and wrestling with leg wax lucks out only in comparison with worse junk like ""Beautiful"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous.""

(Castlerock) Last week Mel Gibson got in touch with his womanly side in ""What Women Want."" This week Sandra Bullock follows suit in ""Miss Congeniality"" a rinky-dink comedy that the actress also produced. Gibson may play a devout misogynist in his gender-bender but hes decidedly more in touch with his inner gal than is Bullocks Gracie Hart a hoydenish FBI agent badly in need of a makeover. The movie in fact was inspired by little beyond that staple of womens magazines and afternoon TV. Gracie reluctantly goes undercover as a beauty contestant hoping to outfox a mad bomber but the real suspense is Will this schlumpy she-man enjoy being a girl? From the time she was a grade-schooler as shown in the movies delightful 1982 prologue she has believed that the way to a mans heart is a blow to the stomach. Unfortunately Marc Lawrences screenplay is never as convincing as this handful of scenes. For reasons that are never made clear Gracie now in her early thirties continues to express herself combatively whether in pursuit of a gang of Russian thugs or the affection of Eric her partner (Benjamin Bratt). She always gets her man but she never gets her man. But when her enthusiasm almost costs a colleague his life her boss (Ernie Hudson) sends her back to desk patrol. In hopes of getting back into his good graces she agrees to don a sash and parade down the runway in a yucky swimsuit to protect the contestants in the Miss United States pageant who have been threatened by the terrorist. With a fey pageant veteran (Michael Caine) as her Pygmalion Gracie learns to say ""yes"" instead of ""yeah"" and to glide when she walks. After a bikini wax a blow-dry and a day without doughnuts she emerges an iron butterfly. Though her male peers are bowled over by the transformation of the tooth-suckin butt-scratchin G-woman the audience is unlikely to be shocked at the miracles of lip gloss. Gracie repeatedly falls off her high heels and says all the wrong things to her fellow contestants who are portrayed as baton-twirling tiara-craving ninnies in favor of world peace. The heroine however is surprised to discover that the other women are supportive especially the endearing innocent Miss Rhode Island (Heather Burns in the movies most noteworthy performance). Bullock makes a nice foil for Burns which surely was not the dimming stars goal. Caines effeminate consultant is trite as is the self-mockery of William Shatner in the role of a has-been performer who emcees the show. Candice Bergen has a thankless part as the pageants prim despotic supervisor. Donald Petries desultory direction does nothing to camouflage ""Miss Congenialitys"" obvious plot or its comic cliches. But to its credit the movie doesnt promote inner beauty as have such recent releases as ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" and ""Beautiful."" Women who dont shave their armpits may applaud the parody of semiprofessional beauties but if those behind the film industry really meant it there would be more ugly people starring in movies. Arent there better targets? All theyre asking for is world peace and of course a tiara. ""Miss Congeniality"" (119 minutes) is rated PG-13.

Starring Sandra Bullock Benjamin Bratt Candice Bergen and William Shatner. Directed by Donald Petrie. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anyone curious about what happens to those Julia Roberts discard scripts need look no further than the new Sandra Bullock movie. ""Miss Congeniality"" has FBI agent Bullock duck undercover as Miss New Jersey at the Miss USA pageant to stop it from being bombed. And while the film works only because of Bullocks sudden need for humiliation it also feels as if it were written with that other lady in mind. Although by the time the movie becomes the Sandra Bullock Pratfall Hour you can see Goldie Hawn having respectfully declined this thing 20 years ago. Itd be wrong to say its fun watching Bullock fall on her keister her face and on other peoples keisters and faces. But shes displayed an irrevocable proficiency for deprecation. Dry heaves crying jags general emotional sincerity Theyre just not her bag. Shes a star who still seems baffled by her stardom. The object of a Sandra Bullock movie lately is for her to embrace the little things -- self-confidence a man who actually likes her the occasional two-piece bathing suit. With that in mind ""Miss Congeniality"" appears to be the Sandra Bullock vehicle -- she feigns lack of interest in being a fly girl; we say ""But Sandy youre a hottie"" She trips we laugh but we also hope she gets up -- so she can do it again. Her movies require a certain juvenile mind-set to enjoy If I root for her its because at a given moment were both 12-year-old girls trying to find a table in the cafeteria. For ""Miss Congeniality"" middle- school angst is transferred to the beauty pageant stage. A mannerless styleless brute Bullocks Grace Hart is Eliza Doolittle in sweats. She doesnt own a dress. She doesnt own a brush. But because shes the only chick in the bureau whod make a persuasive decoy contestant there she is Miss New Jersey -- to the dismay of pageant director and former winner Candice Bergen. Her somewhat less convincing Joisey tongue intact shes hilariously renamed Gracie Freebush and dispatched into the care of beauty consultant Michael Caine whose task is to provide a miracle makeover the likes of which no daytime talk show has seen. Together they play ""Pygmalion"" or -- with Julia Roberts actual man Benjamin Bratt on love-interest duty -- ""Pretty Woman."" And during Caines science project he can be heard recommending ""another two coats and a sealant."" Hidden-camera voyeurism aside when its up for random thoughtless assaults on la vida beauty pageant the movie has an effortlessness that Bullock armed with her slapstick and sarcasm carries to near-lunatic pitch. Immersed in backstage foibles and diva-lite dreams the movie almost becomes a functional ""Showgirls"" dis -- Vegas-y production design techno dance numbers pitchers mounds of foundation and ultra-magnetic emcee William Shatner. But damn director Donald Petrie (""Grumpy Old Men"" ""Richie Rich"") for mistaking Michael Ritchies 1975 pageant-palooza ""Smile"" for some Steven Bochco cop show. He pours on the slo-mo shootouts. For schmaltz Make it a double. The script meanwhile by Katie Ford and Marc Lawrence fails to justify its bomb threat and the hardly shocking culprits. When no ones forcing heart-to-hearts onto them Bullock and Caine have a catty old time trying to exasperate each other. The pull of Bullock walking crazy down Lexington Avenue with Caine strolling in horror beside her is so intoxicating that even the extras boondoggling on the other side of the street have to desist and look up. The proceedings here if you go to the movies to play shrink are really about watching Bullock learn to embrace her inner pretty woman without tripping over her first.

(Castlerock) Well they got the title half right. The ""miss"" part that is as in ""hit or miss."" Whether you find this made-for-TV-grade dreck about a tomboyish FBI agent (Sandra Bullock) going undercover at a beauty pageant ""congenial"" let alone ""funny"" depends on how much eggnog you drink before the opening credits. The jokes are lame the set-up is stupid and Bullock occasionally a winsome comedienne and here a co-producer is annoying as heck. Its not entirely her fault though. As written by Marc Lawrence Katie Ford and Caryn Lucas the character of Gracie Hart is a walking cliche Shes mannish because she eats red meat drinks beer wears glasses has a brain and can defend herself. Oh and shes got an adenoidal laugh borrowed from Fran Drescher late of ""The Nanny"" which (surprise) co-writer Lucas used to write for. Its not until pageant consultant Vic Melling (Michael Caine) gets her fluffed buffed and exfoliated and stuffs her into a streetwalkers dress and high heels that her worth as a woman is fully revealed. At least in the eyes of co-worker Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) a piggish fellow G-man with a George Hamilton perma-tan and the secret hots for Gracie (he just doesnt know it yet). When a Unabomber-style terrorist threatens the Miss United States Pageant off the two go to infiltrate the pageant with Gracie calling herself Gracie Lou Freebush (heh-heh). Unfortunately the film succeeds neither as beauty-contest parody (all the old jokes about padded bras and blonde bimbos are trotted out) nor as fish-out-of-water farce (the gag of Bullock in her Miss New Jersey sash tripping on a pair of stilettos is about as fresh as things get). One high note Continuing his self-deprecating priceline.com shtick William Shatner plays buffoonish contest emcee Stan Fields. Unfortunately director Donald Petrie (of ""Grumpy Old Men"" fame) cant figure out how to make similar hay out of Candice Bergen who as pageant director Kathy Morningside never rises above the stereotype of a shrewish washed-up beauty queen. As for the ""mystery"" youll probably guess who the terrorist is a good half hour before the script tells you but thats only if youve been paying attention. With a film this stupefying it might be hard to stay awake that long. ""Miss Congeniality"" (PG-13 110 minutes) - Contains mild obscenity a bloodless shootout and ogling of women in bathing suits.

Theoretically pics heroine an attitude-filled rough-and-tumble FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty pageant finalist would seem to be a fine fit for star; in reality this is minor stuff more suited to an up-and-comer than an established marquee headliner. Although similarly negligible movies this year have blown out the B.O. lights its hard to imagine this contestant becoming more than a holiday season also-ran. A mini-prologue set in 1982 New Jersey revealing that protag Gracie Harts tough tactics with the opposite sex were ingrained from pre-teenhood promises more pungent laughs and observations than Marc Lawrences screenplay ever delivers. Now in her early 30s Gracie works on a fed undercover operation clumsily enough to get one of her colleagues shot and she is relegated to desk work by boss McDonald (Ernie Hudson who by now is doing this taskmaster thing by rote). At the same time alas the Citizen a right-wing domestic terrorist on whom Gracie has done some homework sends another of his abstruse messages this time declaring that hes ready to attack another target -- the upcoming Miss USA pageant in San Antonio. It hardly takes an FBI cryptographer to decipher where things are headed although Donald Petries manner of helming wending his way through the opening act with a series of tired comic distractions would suggest that Gracies fate is greatly in doubt. Since the only way to beat the terrorist is to go undercover with a female FBI agent as a pageant contestant it is a matter of waiting out the shtick for Bullock to be brought in from the cold by her partner and operation head Eric (Benjamin Bratt). Gracie whose martial arts moves are a whole lot better than her way with a makeup brush is literally pinned to the mat by Eric who gets the ball rolling by arranging a lunch meeting with vet pageant consultant Victor (Michael Caine). Encounter between Bullock and Caine is a true measure of how pic reflects a general decline in the Hollywood comedy of manners. All the elements of a classic confrontation that Hawks or Wilder would have sent over the fence ends up a mere dribbler to the mound; tellingly more laughs are generated by the elementary visual gag of Gracies overnight makeover into a hip-swiveling hottie who captures Erics eye. More puzzling is pics general avoidance of the potentially rich and funny clashes between Gracie and the kind of spindly superficial gals she hates. Out of nowhere Gracie as Miss New Jersey shows off social graces she supposedly never had. Her sarcastic bent is hugely appreciated by the hipper ones among the competish such as Miss New York (Melissa De Sousa) and Gracie even finds herself charmed by the sweetly innocent Cheryl who wears the Miss Rhode Island sash (Heather Burns in pics most endearing perf). In the process Gracie herself gets in touch with her inner Cindy Crawford. Limiting the options for character-based comedy while sending the protag on such a dubious and proscribed course is a clear miscalculation forcing pic to draw its juice from mere plot machinations. Prime among these is a strand involving pageant director Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) -- with her slovenly too-eager son Frank (Steve Monroe) at her side -- whose bitter loss during her beauty queen days has brewed vengeful desires. As always Bullock is game for any situation and she maintains a natural gift for inviting the audience into her characters dilemmas despite their artificiality. Surely burning the candle at both ends as both producer and high-energy star Bullock sometimes misjudges in front of the lens with repetitive mugging which wont win her new converts. The busy Bratt is still waiting for a breakout role; this one is just a few comic paces away from his ramrod-straight cop on ""Law and Order."" Prancing about in lots of pink and lavender garb care of costumer Susie De Santos witty designs Caine has a fine time as the makeover master even if hes vastly overqualified for the modest assignment. Even finer is William Shatner as the clueless pageant emcee a throwaway role that he embraces with every self-mocking fiber he can muster. Bergen appears to be aiming for Lauren Bacall dimensions here an effort that doesnt bring out her best side. For a production lensed by d.p. legend Laszlo Kovacs overall look surprisingly misses the kinds of visual contrasts and color coding suited to a cops-and-beauties lark.

"Miss Congeniality | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; miss-congeniality ) Miss Congeniality (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli If there were lingering doubts that the time has come to write an obituary for Sandra Bullocks days as a leading lady Miss Congeniality should dispel them. Trailing in the wake of a string of duds the most recent of which were the un-releasable Gun Shy and the not-much-better 28 Days Miss Congeniality marks the latest wrong step in a career that once burned brightly. But the days of Speed and While You Were Sleeping are long past. Bullock must bear the responsibility for Miss Congenialitys failure - not only is she the star but shes the producer as well. Its impossible to absolve someone when they wear those hats - some of the disapprobation goes to director Donald Petrie (Grumpy Old Men) but the lions portion is reserved for Bullock. Miss Congeniality introduces us to Gracie Hart (Bullock) a no-nonsense tomboy FBI agent whos part of a team on the trail of a vicious serial killer who goes by the name of ""The Citizen."" In order to track her quarry she must go undercover as Miss New Jersey in the annual Miss United States beauty pageant held in San Antonio Texas. So after convincing the pair who run the pageant Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) and her faithful sidekick Stan (William Shatner) that her participation is warranted Gracie starts getting to know her co-contestants while keeping the FBI team leader Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) informed of the status of her investigation. Meanwhile beauty contest consultant Vic Melling (Michael Caine) is brought in to transform Gracie into a picture of elegance and grace - a task he initially deems impossible. Even in peak form Bullock has never been regarded a great actress and her occasional forays into dramatic material have confirmed this perception. However she is normally charismatic and appealing - qualities that are inexplicably absent in her portrayal of Gracie Miss Congenialitys protagonist. Here she is dull and lifeless although no more so than her male co-star Benjamin Bratt (giving indications that hes following in David Carusos footsteps on the pathway from TV stardom into motion picture oblivion) who looks like hes appearing in a Steven Seagal act-alike contest. Julia Roberts must see something in this guy in real life that doesnt show up on the screen. The romantic pairing of Bullock and Bratt turns out to be a horrible mistake. They fizzle when they should sizzle and have all the zing of carbonated water gone flat. Fortunately supporting players like Michael Caine and William Shatner are on hand to liven things up. In addition to having nearly every amusing line dished out by the lame and predictable script Caine seems to be enjoying himself as a gay beauty contest consultant. And William Shatner who looks more like the Pillsbury Dough Boy than Captain Kirk offers an amusing send-up of himself crossed with Burt Parks. The existence of Beautiful saves Miss Congeniality from being the worst beauty contest movie of the year but if ever a statement could be accused of damning with faint praise thats it. This film is a mess - it cant make up its mind whether it wants to be a drama a comedy or an action movie. At times it descends into slapstick (as when Gracie teaches the art of self-defense by abusing Eric) but more often than not it slips into overt sentimentality. In fact during those scenes when Michael Caine is not around the movie is in constant danger of wallowing in mawkishness. Miss Congeniality also steals shamelessly from Pygmalion (Vic making over Gracie from an ugly duckling cop into a stunning statuesque beauty) but truncates the process to the point where it loses its appeal. Plus there are a few perfunctory action sequences - but these have all the energy of a dead battery. And havent we seen enough beauty contest bashing in the past few years? Maybe Christopher Guest (Best In Show) could do something interesting with this material but not Petrie. This is a film where the dull unappealing pieces greatly outnumber those that offer ephemeral entertainment. Its an obvious dud which raises the question of why Warner Brothers chose to throw it into theaters during the single most competitive week of the year (instead of waiting a month and jettisoning it with all of the other January trash). Regardless Miss Congeniality will reach video as quickly as Bullocks last two films. Hopefully the next time the actress surfaces she will have regained the charm that initially put her in the public spotlight. If not the quality of her output isnt likely to increase from what Miss Congeniality offers.
