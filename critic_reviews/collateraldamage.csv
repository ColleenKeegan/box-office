Notwithstanding the momentary eagerness of some industry moguls to offer consulting services to the Bushies Hollywood is ever more likely to ask what its country can do for it than the other way around. The answer in the case of Collateral Damage is a lot Its a sure bet that the groundswell of patriotism and firefighter adoration weve witnessed over the past five months -- not to mention the sky-high levels of public anxiety about international terrorism -- will prove Gods gift to the ticket sales of Andrew Davis thriller about a valiant Los Angeles fireman who takes on the Colombian guerrilla responsible for blowing up his wife and son. Which may be one reason why the studio thoughtfully provided an array of advance screenings for critics instead of one of those two-days-before-release-day media events that typically shelter a potential blockbuster from unwelcome notices before its crucial opening weekend. Another is that aside from the movies touching conviction that the answer to Colombias civil war and Americas new vulnerability lies in Arnold Schwarzeneggers dependably bulging biceps Collateral Damage is a pretty decent action picture. Granted the movie suffers from the liabilities that often attend the genre a breezy disregard for character in a screenplay -- by novice writers David and Peter Griffiths -- composed almost entirely of threatening monosyllables. (""Whenre you gonna kill me?"" ""Right now."" Thunk.) But the highs offer all the technical competence and suspense weve a right to expect from the director of The Fugitive including a heart-stopping set piece that persuades you over and over that the movie has climaxed only to apply another wicked turn of the screw. The opening sequence in which a firefighter is seen desperately trying to save victims in a burning building is sure to stir up recent fears. It turns out to be a nurses prophetic anxiety dream for in short order she and her little boy really do go up in flames when a terrorist blows up the tall building in Los Angeles outside which theyve been waiting for her husband Gordy whose dedication to his job is exceeded only by his devotion to his family. Its not just the Teutonic accent that makes Schwarzenegger a wildly improbable choice to play an all-American everyman hero The poor man appears crippled by doubt about whether hes meant to be terminator or kindergarten cop. For a brief spell the grieving husband comes on like a deranged bull trashing the offices of a Colombian terrorist sympathizer who refers in a television interview to the death of Gordys wife and son as ""collateral damage."" Then hes the innocent abroad who having witnessed some pointless bickering between a Senate inquiry committee and the CIA over how to respond to the bombing without jeopardizing the U.S.s chummy relations with the Colombian government straps on a backpack and sneaks into the country to play avenging angel pausing briefly to save some peasants from El Lobo (""The Wolf"") the guerrilla drug lord who set the bomb and to wipe out his cocaine-processing plant. Along the way Gordy meets two expatriate North American sources of comic relief (John Leguizamo and John Turturro) and stumbles across a parallel narrative involving Selena an enigmatic young European (played by the luscious-lipped Italian actress Francesca Neri whos as near as this primly chaste movie gets to a love interest) and her adopted little boy Mauro. The pair not only remind him of his dead family but engineer some quality face time with his quarry. And what a generic face it is. Had Davis set Collateral Damage in the Middle East the movie would likely have languished even longer unreleased too close to the bone of current events. Still for all practical purposes El Lobo (played by New Zealander Cliff Curtis whos looking at a long and lucrative career portraying swarthy Others) is the functional equivalent of the movie Arab -- indiscriminately cruel rapacious and vicious fanatically dedicated to ends over means and contemptuous of all that North America holds dear. ""Whats the difference between you and I?"" asks the grammatically challenged Colombian when he has Gordy in his steely grip. ""Ze difference"" replies his unflappable prisoner ""is zat Im just going to kill you"" -- as opposed to several buildings full of unsuspecting Americans scores of innocent peasants who serve Davis grisly fondness for the artfully arranged dead body as much as they do the guerrilla leaders blood lust and a mildly incompetent subordinate whom El Lobo rebukes by forcing a reptile down his throat. Gordy it goes without saying kills only when he must -- and that along with the family values his enemy disdains is what makes him an American. Never mind that the callous euphemism from which the movie takes its title a bit of blarney created by our own military is blithely projected into the mouth of the enemy. To be American as Hollywood movies have been telling us since World War II is to fight a morally refined war -- a claim thats not merely refutable by history but also signals a deluded naivete about the practice of war itself which allows for few such niceties.

Sep. 13 600pm Of course theres no reason to sentimentalize the Colombian civil war none of whose factions can be described as good liberals. Still Collateral Damage is far more telling in what it suggests unwittingly for the most part about us about the rabid mixture of hubris paranoia xenophobia and downright muddleheadedness with which we define our own place on the stage of world terrorism not to mention the bizarre uses to which American individualism can be put under pressure. That the movie offers a ringing endorsement of vigilante justice is par for the course Its an Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller. Yet in the process of tracking down the man who not only killed his family but -- in a plot twist whose eerie prescience must have the distributors reaching for their Maalox -- plans to blow up some crucial government buildings in Washington D.C. Gordy finds himself a target not only of El Lobo but of a ruthless CIA loose cannon represented in a weaselly turn by the Canadian actor Elias Koteas. Meanwhile scenes of U.S.-sponsored planes zooming in to flatten the drug barons hideaway evoke shades of Apocalypse Now and fears of the Vietnamization of American involvement in Colombia. Collateral Damage may be pressing its Hollywood-liberal credentials here but it wouldnt surprise me if the vast majority of American moviegoers see in Gordy a reflection of their own mistrust of institutions be they ""theirs"" or ours. It may after all be easier for Americans to love a firefighter than it is for them to love their government.COLLATERAL DAMAGE | Directed by ANDREW DAVIS Written by DAVID GRIFFITHS amp; PETER GRIFFITHS Produced by STEVEN REUTHER and DAVID FOSTER Released by Warner Bros.

"Collateral Damage Overshoots Its Mark washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Collateral Damage Overshoots Its Mark Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 8 2002 ""Collateral Damage"" the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie famously postponed after 9-11 seemslike a telegram from a dead world. It hails from the America that no longer exists a world that ended in fire. In this film you see things continually that could not happen today. A man deposits a briefcase next to a potted plant in Union Station and saunters away. Hed be nailed before he got 10 feet. A childs toy is not examined but shunted around a checkpoint at the entrance to a highly secure government office. No way. A mysterious police officer parks his motorcycle in front of a foreign embassy and wanders off just before a party of dignitaries shows up. Never. You also see things that could not happen any day. Chief among these is that a firefighter - a Los Angeleno with a suspiciously thick Austrian accent and the muscles of a bratwurst Clydesdale - sneaks into Colombia and languageless planless and clueless simply bluffs his way from one end of the country to the other ultimately penetrating a secret guerrilla compound that not even the CIA has found. There he improvises a clever bomb. I doubt this could even happen in Columbia much less Colombia; Arnolds accent would give him away there too. Then theres the very thorny issue of the title subject about which one must say at least the movie worries a little bit one mans collateral damage being another mans family tragedy. How can one make sense of that paradox? The movie gamely tries; just as gamely it fails because its from a world where moral equivalence and promiscuous empathy were still the colors of the day and it was possible to equate a terrorist bombing in Los Angeles with a helicopter gunship attack on a terrorist base in Colombia and hold the authors of each equally guilty. That was glibly easy when there had been no foreign terrorist bombings on American soil that claimed casualties in double figures; its almost impossible in an America when terrorist bombings have claimed casualties in quadruple figures when we are in the middle of an enormously popular war and sad but inevitable our military pilots create collateral damage on nearly every mission. You may let these considerations spoil the movie for you or not depending on your sensitivities to such matters. But all that aside does the movie work if one makes a willful effort to banish context from the experience? Well a little better than you might expect given the simplicity of the story which simply follows as Schwarzeneggers character gets even. His wife and child slaughtered in that original L.A. terrorist attack the (then) wishy-washy State Department uninterested in pursuing mere justice in place of geopolitical wisdom he goes it alone mano a guerrilla movement. Its all too easy and one of the movies problems is the eerie disconnect between what it is showing you as real and your deep instincts that it couldnt have happened that easily. But you might not notice. Thats because the director is Andrew Davis who might be called a good action mechanic as his ""Above the Law"" and ""The Fugitive"" attest; so the film has a high level of who-what-where-when authenticity to it. Its set in a natural believable world not a fantasy place like so many of Schwarzeneggers other films and the craftsman Davis has a penchant for setting. He makes the fire in which we first discover Arnolds Gordon Brewer performing heroically feel palpably real; likewise the bombing in downtown L.A. and the seedy jungles and decrepit cities of Colombia and finally the inside of various D.C. institutional buildings from rail stations to State Department annexes. And theres some cleverness too. As Schwarzeneggers character is a fireman he does in fact know all the practical things a fireman would know electrical wiring explosion potential the incendiary qualities of certain chemicals. Suppose hed been a life insurance salesman He could have bored the guerrillas to death by explaining the difference between term and whole life. I liked too some late plot reversals sorely needed after the numbingly simple straight-ahead plunge of the first hour of the movie. Things arent quite what they seem and the twists are neatly done. All that said the movie still feels stale. Schwarzenegger tries hard to act but in the end the foolishness of the thriller formula becomes ridiculous; our old friend the villain who seems to be dead but isnt really puts in several appearances and theres too much motorcycling through too many tunnels that probably arent there in the first place. What is to become of Arnold Schwarzenegger? Its a question this movie cannot help but raise. COLLATERAL DAMAGE (R 105 minutes) - contains violence and profanity. At area theaters.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Collateral Damage Sidney Baldwin) C Collateral Damage Genre Mystery and Thriller Action/Adventure; Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Cliff Curtis Elias Koteas John Leguizamo Francesca Neri John Turturro; Director Andrew Davis; Author Michael Colleary Mike Werb; Release Date Wide 02/08/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 115; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted February 13 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Of all the coincidental overlaps between Collateral Damage and our own terrorist tragedy (valiant firemen murderous anti-American fanatics innocents who die in a bombed building) theres one that makes the movie look even dumber than it would have before. When the terrorist mastermind a Colombian guerrilla known as the Wolf appears on videotape wearing a black hood he looks next to Osama bin Laden about as threatening as a third-grade bully. Its part of the films topical disconnect that the Wolf and his band of thugs who stand around in Che Guevara berets spewing anti-U.S. rhetoric are so vague in their hatred that we have no idea what they stand for. Are we supposed to think that the drug money that rules Colombia has fueled a nuevo Marxist revolution? A Los Angeles fireman Gordon Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) having lost his wife and son in that attacked building sets off for Colombia to seek vengeance the way a real man does - with his bare hands. As he travels upriver through Panama the impersonal direction of Andrew Davis (was ""The Fugitive"" a fluke or what?) threatens to turn ""Collateral Damage"" into a cross between ""Apocalypse Now"" and a bad Steven Seagal movie. Schwarzenegger at 54 is long past being able to run leap and knuckle peoples heads in with his old Teutonic vigor. (He and the equally sedentary Seagal ought to team up for a thriller reunion of kick-butt 80s vigilantes; they could call it ""Armchair Armageddon."") The result is an ""action film"" mired in stasis. The ending piles on the potboiler mayhem but its telling that Schwarzeneggers climactic catchphrase is down to one measly word. This time hes the luggage.

Damage beyond repair / Schwarzenegger cant rescue silly if efficient action thriller 1 / 3 Back to Gallery COLLATERAL DAMAGE Action thriller. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Directed by Andrew Davis. Written by David Griffiths and Peter Griffiths. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Over-coiffed stretched tight and buffed to a polish Arnold Schwarzenegger at the age of 54 is looking more than ever like a fully engineered clone of himself. In ""Collateral Damage"" a terrorist-attack thriller that Warner Bros. postponed from October after the events of Sept. 11 Schwarzenegger plays Gordy Brewer a Los Angeles firefighter who turns vigilante after his wife and son are killed by a Colombian terrorists bomb. In a calculated bid to revive his lapsed superstardom Schwarzenegger posits himself as a family man who having lost everything converts grief into bloodlust. In early scenes Gordy stays up all night building a model spaceship for his 5-year-old son showers with him and exudes a kind of loving softness thats antithetical to Arnolds monosyllabic cyborg image. Later outraged by the United States failure to vindicate his loss -- and by a terrorist sympathizer who describes his wife and sons murders as accidental ""collateral damage"" -- Arnold decides to Rambo himself down to Colombia to exterminate ""El Lobo"" (The Wolf) the anti-American guerrilla who planted the bomb. Fueled by destiny and rage the folly of the screenwriters and the nectar of revenge Arnold enters by foot through the Panamanian jungle. The plot is beyond preposterous and yet Arnold being Arnold things tend to happen like Gordy surviving fireballs grenades land mines and a plunge down a waterfall; like Gordy fighting off armed thugs even though his hands are shackled; like Gordy getting warm and fuzzy with Selena (Francesca Neri) El Lobos foxy wife. Basically a silly adrenaline-pumper -- albeit one thats reaped a gold mine of publicity thanks to Sept. 11 -- ""Collateral Damage"" was directed by Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") and is therefore more efficient less bombastic and less tedious than one might expect. What were watching is goony and absurd -- since when do Colombian peasants all speak English? -- but Davis at least has the good taste not to bludgeon us with overmixed sound effects a florid score and frantic pacing. One even gets the impression during a critical high-rise bombing scene that Davis cut out a lot of the material because of its resemblance to the World Trade Center tragedy. In other words ""Collateral Damage"" is trash but it earns extra points by acting as if it werent. Some of the performances arent bad New Zealander Cliff Curtis (""Once Were Warriors"") plays El Lobo with a canny charm that makes him all the more diabolical and John Leguizamo has some jump-off- the-screen moments as a wired coke manufacturer who talks mambo-mouth street jive with El Lobos henchmen. Schwarzenegger on the other hand has never learned to act and disguises that fact with a performance thats meant to be spare and taut but just looks mechanical. His deficiencies are especially glaring after the deaths of his wife and son Scrunching his mug into a mask of grief Arnold looks more blank than bereft. One last word Despite the restraint that Davis exhibits in many regards he cant resist indulging one of the worst cinematic cliches. In the scene where Arnolds family is buried Davis opens with a crane shot that starts in the trees and tilts down to the grave site and assembled mourners. Like car chases that end with overturned fruit carts or overworked yuppies who answer cell phones in restaurants the cemetery crane shot is one of those bled-dry movie conventions that cant help looking like a parody. Isnt it time for an industry-imposed moratorium? Advisory This movie contains violence and raw language.

USATODAY.com - Collateral is damaged goods Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/08/2002 - Updated 0938 AM ET Collateral is damaged goods By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Collateral Damage (out of four) Stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Elias Koteas Francesca Neri Cliff Curtis Director Andrew Davis Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for violence and some language There are two things everyone knows about Collateral Damage It stars everyones favorite mega-ripped Austrian and its October opening was postponed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.With all the publicity surrounding the film you know whats in store. It comes in the first action-packed 10 minutes when a bomb rips through a high-rise building and engulfs it in flames. Seeing it still sends a chill down the spine and is a reminder that we may never be able to watch such destruction the detached way we did before 9/11. Read more below Related Story Collateral ignites a 9/11 controversy Studios invest Collateral with post-9/11 hopes Activists slam Schwarzenegger film But the movie was conceived long before then and the plot is incidental. Its laughably unbelievable yet its hard to snicker at anything involving terrorists even Collaterals obscure Colombian variety. What we get is simply another opportunity for Schwarzenegger -- who seems to be in perpetual Terminator mode -- to flex his muscles. As firefighter Gordy Brewer hes despondent after his wife and son are among nine people killed during the bombing of the Los Angeles office tower. A one-man terrorist machine claims responsibility (he wants the United States out of Colombia) and Brewer buffs his steely resolve to exact vengeance. The ease with which the big man terminates is tempered this time around. He is set on revenge for the murder of his family but he also is older and wiser even a bit wistful. Not that Schwarzeneggers limited acting range makes this abundantly clear; director Andrew Davis is deft enough with details to convince us that Brewer is a man who is driven by pain and loss. The targeted terrorist is the ridiculously nicknamed El Lobo (Cliff Curtis) a Colombian version of Osama bin Laden without the fanatical religious element. El Lobos face is well known to the lowliest government operatives before the bombing then widely broadcast in news accounts afterward. But somehow he manages to return undetected to Washington D.C. of all places a few weeks after the bombing. No Americans recognize the notorious rebel leader behind the heinous bombing. But absurdly a street vendor in a tiny Colombian village recognizes Brewer who was only briefly interviewed on American TV and turns him over to El Lobos terrorist organization. Because its Schwarzenegger we all know our hero wont be down for long and what follows however far-fetched elicited supportive cheers from the audience. It seems that as long as Schwarzenegger has the fabulous pecs and brawny biceps (he peels off his shirt so slowly in one scene its like a striptease) audiences will root for him. His body wont stay in action-movie shape forever so a new career could be ahead. Brewer is seen in an early shot holding an American flag coffee mug backing the notion that Schwarzenegger could be setting the stage for a run for office. But first hell have to exercise some damage control.

"Minimal Damage washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Minimal Damage Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 8 2002 AS THE years progress and my memory dims even more I suspect the only thing Ill remember about ""Collateral Damage"" is the way Arnold Schwarzenegger goes Tyson on someones ear. In a tussle with Colombian terrorists our Arnold clamps his teeth onto a bad guys ear and tears the thing clean off. He holds it in his mouth for a moment like a Doberman uncertain what to do with such an unappetizing chunk of meat. Then he spits it out. Ptui The crowd - at least the one I saw this movie with - howls with nervous laughter. Come to think of it Ill probably remember the scene with the snake too. But I guess Ive given enough away for one review. Of course all the chatter about ""Collateral Damage"" centers on its delayed release in apparent deference to the events of Sept. 11. After all the story is about Gordy Brewer (Schwarzenegger) a Los Angeles firefighter who takes revenge on the Colombian terrorists who have killed his wife and small child. But now the emotional debris has somewhat settled we can see the movie for what it is a fair-to-middling action flick that never deserved association with anything momentous in the first place. ""Collateral Damage"" is head-scratchingly ordinary given Schwarzeneggers need to prove hes still a virile (i.e. non-aging) action hero. And if it does any business I suspect it will be for what the audience brings to the movie not the other way around. Will people flock to see this for some sort of vicarious revenge? Or will they recoil at the very thought of a movie like this? Or will they barely notice the movies alive? It remains to be seen. Speaking of revenge thats the main motivation here - splash-painted with primary colors. In a rather twisted setup to engage our sympathy we see Gordy making cute with his Central Casting wife Anne (Lindsay Frost) and his adorable son Matt (Ethan Dampf). Theyre goners and you know it. The inevitable happens. If you havent seen the preview 24 times already Anne and Matt Brewer are caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. A bomb blast intended to assassinate CIA operative Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) kills Gordys family instead. The assassin Gordy learns is a mysterious figure (Cliff Curtis) named El Lobo or ""the Wolf."" But when political considerations between Brandt and the Colombians put Gordys loss on the back burner its time for solo heroics. Next stop jungles of Colombia featuring encounters (friendly and otherwise) with characters named Felix (John Leguizamo) and Armstrong (John Turturro). Theres also Selena (Francesca Neri) whose links to the Wolf could prove helpful. Even by the fast-and-loose standards of action filmmaking ""Collateral Damage"" is a disappointment. Andrew Davis is a terrific director which he demonstrated in ""The Fugitive"" ""Above the Law"" and ""Under Siege."" But hes working with a pedestrian script from David and Peter Griffiths. Even the action scenes including a white-water escape from guerrillas the usual helicopter attack on a terrorist camp and a lackluster finale back on American soil elicit only moderate excitement. The only thing that keeps you awake is the delicious possibility of Schwarzenegger delivering something by movies end whether its a quotable drop-dead line a killer look in the eyes or something comical.

After all at a time when many Americans want revenge against the elusive Osama bin Laden it can be appealing to watch Schwarzenegger track down the bad guy beat him to a pulp kill him (or her) at least three times and then in an orgasmic wave of ""and justice for all"" we get to slam our buttered-popcorn-encrusted hands together and cheer as the credits roll. Theres just one itty-bitty little problem. The movie stinks. Lately Schwarzenegger has gotten it into his head that he can play an ""everyman"" on screen. That thespian archetype was created by the likes of Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart and now owned by actors such as Tom Hanks and Billy Bob Thornton. Arnold is many things a movie star a bodybuilding icon a rich and powerful role model for millions. But hes not a skilled subtle actor and in order to pull off being an everyman youve got to know how to act. Not only can Arnold not act but hes also having trouble carrying films. His last two -- ""End of Days"" (1999) and ""The 6th Day"" (2000) -- tanked at the box office with Arnold trying to be a more or less regular guy.

"Collateral Damage | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; collateral-damage ) Collateral Damage (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once Arnold Schwarzenegger strode across the screen like a god. Never an actor but always an icon Schwarzeneggers presence was so commanding that even his critics were forced to take notice. Part charisma part swagger he would blow into multiplexes like a force of nature dispatching bad guys with a flex of his biceps while spitting out one lines with panache. No one who went to the movies in the late-80s or early 90s will ever forget ""Ill be back"" or ""Hasta la vista baby."" All things end however even the reign of the action gods. Sylvester Stallone has tried (with limited success) to transition into more serious acting. Bruce Willis has turned his back on wisecracking heroes like John McClane. Aided and abetted by drug problems Jean Claude Van Damme has faded from the public view. Only Schwarzenegger unmovable as Atlas struggles against the advancing years and changing times. It is a battle he cannot win. Collateral Damage is the third movie for Schwarzenegger following his late-90s heart surgery. Like the previous two (End of Days and The Sixth Day) which were box office disappointments this one has a downbeat tone. The Schwarzenegger charisma is muted. One of the stars greatest attributes during his heyday was that he never took himself too seriously. But by its nature Collateral Damage doesnt allow levity. No flip one-liners. No sly winks at the audience. Its a grim humorless affair and Schwarzenegger is a lifeless automaton. Arnold has screen presence but he cannot act. Attempts to shape him into a different kind of action hero - one with darker motives and deep internal conflicts - are doomed to failure. The wreckage of Collateral Damage offers ample proof of this. It comes across as a glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick. Much has been written about the films delayed release date. It was the highest profile motion picture casualty of the September 11 attack. Originally slated for an early October 2001 release the producers deemed that the wound on the American psyche was too fresh for the movie-going public to stomach a film that deals with terrorist attacks on American soil. Four months later the climate has changed. Now Warner Brothers believes were in the mood to see Arnold kick some terrorist butt (even though the terrorists in Collateral Damage are Colombian not Arabs). Gordon Brewer (Schwarzenegger) is a Los Angeles firefighter - a man who risks his life every day to save others. He has a loving wife and a young son and is well liked and respected in the community. He seems to have the perfect life - until the day when a terrorist bomb attack kills nine people including Gordons wife and child. The name of the terrorist is ""The Wolf"" (Cliff Curtis) - and Gordon is the only one to have seen his face. On the way to meet his family Gordon encountered a police officer who was really the Wolf in disguise. Now Gordon wants revenge. So he heads to Colombia where the Wolf has his lair with the intention of tracking down and killing the man. Meanwhile CIA Agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas) decides to use Gordon as a weapon in his war against drugs. One of the problems with Collateral Damage is that for an action film the pace is sluggish. Much of the first hour is devoted to setup and exposition and when the action finally comes its not unique or energetic enough to justify the wait. Its basically Arnold pounding on his enemies until they are subdued. Theres something a little disconcerting about watching him in these fight scenes. Hes still big and burly but at age 54 Schwarzenegger is starting to look a little too old to be involved in this kind of stuff. Action films are the province of younger stars. The plot is generic. It follows a predictable path and the one ""big"" surprise wont be unexpected for anyone who is paying attention. There are plenty of opportunities to send things off in interesting directions but director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive Chain Reaction) and his screenwriters dont bother. Instead were fed familiar-looking action sequences flavored with a number of time-honored clichA(c)s including the villain-who-doesnt-die and the man-outracing-a-fireball. It will be a monumental effort for the average viewer to sit through this film without stifling at least one yawn. There are two key ingredients to any good revenge flick. The first is that the heros cause has to be just. Collateral Damage has that. The second is that the villain has to be so utterly completely evil that the audience will be salivating for the hero to kick the hell out of him grind him up and feed his bloody remains to vultures. Collateral Damage doesnt have that. As bad guys go the Wolf is bland. Worse still the screenplay makes a half-hearted attempt to humanize him by giving him a wife and son and providing an explanation for his actions. None of this has us weeping with sympathy for the Wolf but it doesnt fuel our hatred and outrage. So we care less than we should and when he receives his inevitable comeuppance it hardly merits a shrug. The film has one saving grace - a delightfully quirky performance by John Turturro in a small role as Gordons cellmate in a Colombian jail. Tuturros not around for long but when he is there he easily steals every scene from the films bigger and higher paid star. Whats more the only times when Schwarzenegger seems to come alive are when he shares the screen with Turturro. After seeing these two together for about five minutes I could envision a pretty good buddy movie. Unfortunately thats not what the filmmakers had in mind. Later Schwarzenegger is briefly paired with John Leguizamo with dramatically less satisfying results. For Arnold Schwarzenegger this may represent the end of the line. He has a few sequels lined up - Terminator 3 True Lies 2 Conan 3 - but those have more going for them than the Schwarzenegger name. They will undoubtedly succeed but not just because hes in them. And politics beckon. Like Ronald Reagan Schwarzenegger would like to turn his attention to making a run at the California governorship. Ultimately that challenge may appeal to him more than trying to reclaim his place in the minds of a fickle movie-going population that currently views him as a fossil.
