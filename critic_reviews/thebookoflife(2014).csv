It opens with a museum tour explaining Mexicos annual Day of the Dead festival then plunges into an afterlife where the departed thrive in the colourful Land of Remembrance or languish in the ashen Land of the Forgotten. It might be a bit complicated for very young kids. But theres a love story by way of illustration as a musician (Diego Luna) and a soldier (Channing Tatum) vie for the hand of a strong-willed senorita (Zoe Saldana). With a captivating visual design inspired by folksy wooden toys the whole enchilada is brightly detailed exuberant and simply bursting with winning cultural pride. Not dissimilar in merrily ghoulish spirit to The Nightmare Before Christmas its hugely entertaining. The life-and-death lessons might seem slightly preachy but where else would you find super-cute piggies a bishop in a wrestling mask and a laugh-out-loud Radiohead gag?

But for some reason it doesnat. 181 Shares Share 158 Tweet 19 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Twentieth Century Fox Producer Guillermo del Toros name is all over The Book of Life even though it was conceived co-written and directed by animator Jorge Gutierrez. Its an understandable association though. The film is just macabre enough to feel of a piece with del Toros other films which often fuse a childs-eye view of the world with the grim and the uncanny. Gutierrezs animated film is a family-friendly story that celebrates Mexico and Mexican culture in particularA el Dia de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead) the holiday reserved for communing with ones ancestors who have passed from this world. Its a potentially grisly setup but the actual movie makes death look downright fun. Before settling on a fairly conventional love triangle the film gives some context to the Day of the Dead. Beyond our own world there is the Land of the Remembered where our beloved forebears go when they die and where they live in festive communal immortality presided over by La Muerte (voiced by Kate del Castillo). Beyond (or beneath) that however lies the Land of the Forgotten a joyless place where a whisper can turn you into dust; this is where you go if nobody in the Land of the Living remembers you and its all presided over by the creepy Xibalba (Ron Perlman) a green glowing grinning beast covered in candles and chains. (Theres also a godlike entity called the Candlestick Maker voiced by a rather unexpectedly joyful Ice Cube.) Less a devil and more a lovesick trickster Xibalba makes a bet with his beloved Muerte. They find three best friends -- two young boys and a girl -- and each stakes their kingdom on which boy will marry the girl. Winner gets to rule the Land of the Remembered. The film then follows the three kids as they grow up in the touristically quaint town of San Angel which is right in the middle of Mexico (which itself is of course ""the center of the universe"" as the film reminds us). Manolo (voiced as an adult by Diego Luna) comes from a legendary bullfighting family and is himself a talented matador save for the fact that he hates the idea of killing bulls; he wants to play the guitar instead. Joaquin (voiced by a very game Channing Tatum) is the son of a late military hero and has been pegged for glory as the one to save San Angel from the fierce bandit Chacal. Their object of desire Maria (Zoe Saldana) the Mayors daughter is a firecracker of a beauty well educated and independent; shes the one who teaches Manolo the wrongness of mistreating animals when she frees some adorable pigs early on in the film wreaking havoc in her fathers town. A The playful rivalry of Manolo and Joaquin for Maria is egged on by Xibalba and La Muerte in somewhat schematic though visually inventive ways. Im sure Im not revealing any big surprises when I say that a journey through the Lands of the Remembered and the Forgotten is in the cards for some of our heroes. If the human characters are designed to look like carved wooden puppets the dead simply look like carved wooden skeletons just a degree more ornate and unreal. And the Land of the Remembered feels at times like a roller-coaster ride crossed with a carnival a landscape cluttered with luminous pyramids and castles and plazas and skull-shaped hot-air balloons as far as the eye can see in keeping with the films festive take on the afterlife. Theres no color scheme theres just color everywhere -- which makes sense because we miss it all when we enter the Realm of the Forgotten. Such a crowded colorful more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason it doesnt. Maybe its just the fact that as the story becomes more and more predictable the imagery gets more delirious. And that eye-popping sense of wonder actually helps mitigate the films more conventional elements. The too-cute-by-half contemporary pop songs played by street musicians for example feel somehow more surreal when done against such a crazed colorful backdrop; and the heros predictable journey through a visually florid underworld becomes something we anticipate rather than just jadedly accept. The Book of Life may be all surface ... but wow what a surface.

"Review Book brims with Life - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Book brims with LifeBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 10/17/2014 120000 AM PDTUpdated 10/17/2014 035559 PM PDT This image released by Twentieth Century Fox shows the character Maria voiced by Zoe Saldana in a scene from ""The Book of Life."" The movie opens Friday Oct. 17 2014. (AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox) The most memorable animated films devote equal energies to storytelling ingenuity and eye-popping visuals. Jorge R. Gutierrezs ""The Book of Life"" balances both creating glorious new worlds through words and imagery. The result is an enchanting 3-D family film timed for upcoming Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) festivities.Produced by Guillermo del Toro ""Life"" transports us to a Tolkien-sized world anchored around an annual tradition in the Latino world that affectionately illuminates the symbolic nature of the celebration in which the living recall and reconnect with the dead. Along the way ""Book of Life"" also proudly and ambitiously spotlights larger themes of Mexican culture and heritage.Without a doubt the animation is a triple-shot latte to the eyes with sweeping scenes that make Mexican folk art come to colorful cinematic life. This folk-art theme plays through with lead characters that are intricately hand-painted figurines made out of wood. Even with all that eye candy on display Gutierrez manages to keep his pop-up-book spectacle from drowning out ""Lifes"" noble intentions. Advertisement The plot-dense film scripted by Gutierrez and Doug Langdale opens with sassy museum tour guide Mary Beth (voice of Christina Applegate) leading a group of unruly students to an off-the-grid section where the magical Book of Life is stored. Mary Beth acts as the capable (and much-needed) narrator filling in the background of a somewhat complicated storyline. The captivating legend involves feuding wife-husband deities who place bets on whom Maria (Zoe Saldana) a young girl and then woman will marry. Will it be Manolo (voice of Diego Luna of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") a sensitive guitar-playing romantic stuck in the family tradition of becoming a matador? Or will it be Joaquin (Channing Tatum) a handsome soldier-hero more concerned about himself than others?La Muerte (Kate DiCastillo) the more compassionate deity places bets on Manolo. She rules the Land of the Remembered an exuberantly joyful region where the dead go to be fondly recalled by the living. Her estranged and cunning husband Xibalba (Ron Perlman) rules the dreary Land of the Forgotten the territory where the dead who have been abandoned by loved ones congregate.If Maria winds up with Joaquin Xibalba will assume command of the Land of the Remembered and La Muerte will get saddled with the Land of the Forgotten. This image released by Twentieth Century Fox shows the character Manolo voiced by Diego Luna in a scene from ""The Book of Life."" The film opens Friday Oct. 17 2014. (AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox) (Twentieth Century Fox amp; Reel FX) We know whom were rooting for.With its myth-building large cast of characters shifting narratives and time periods its a risky thing to pull off. But ""The Book of Life"" juggles it capably even as the storyline shuttles back and forth from Mary Beth to the three lovebirds. In that way its a true original even if adheres to a few obvious staples. Like many animated films ""Life"" inserts snippets of well-known songs along with some written for the screen. Still as Manolo is a musician this fits with his character. The silly humor is less successful only mildly amusing with some jokes falling flat. But these are small issues. Even though ""The Book of Life"" isnt on a par with ""The Lego Movie"" it comes close. Without a doubt it is one of 2014s best animated films; a holiday delight that exuberantly bursts at the seams with irresistible cultural pride.The book of life    Rating PG (mild action rude humor some thematic elements and brief scary images) Cast Voices by Diego Luna Zoe Saldana Channing Tatum Christina ApplegateDirector Jorge R.

"Book of Life The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; book-of-life-the ) Book of Life The (United States 2014) October 16 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Book of Life represents Guillermo del Toros most hands-on foray (to date) into the realm of family friendly entertainment; this is closer in tone and sensibility to one of Tim Burtons offbeat animated films than one of Pixars more ""vanilla"" productions. The visual aesthetic is unusual with the characters being modeled as 3-D wooden puppets. I was reminded of a more polished version of some of the old live action TV Christmas specials. Background detail doesnt match that of many other big budget animated films but the presentation is quirky enough to make this less important. The 3-D however is disappointing. It adds nothing and is so low-key that it might as well not be there. The Book of Life opens in a modern-day setting with a conventional animated style. A group of rambunctious kids visiting a museum hear a story excerpted from ""The Book of Life"" by their tour guide (voice of Christina Applegate). This tale takes place in long-ago Mexico and revolves around November 2 The Day of the Dead. Two boys aspiring bull fighter and guitar player Manolo (Diego Luna) and would-be champion and defender of the town Joaquin (Channing Tatum) are in love with the same girl a spirited firebrand named Maria (Zoe Saldana). Observing their interactions the gods place a bet on which boy will win Marias hand. La Muerta (Kate del Castillo) the ruler of the bright heavenly Land of the Remembered chooses Manolo. Her opponent (and spouse) Xibalba (Ron Perlman) the lord of the gray hellish Land of the Forgotten opts for Joaquim. Once the children have reached adulthood its apparent that Maria prefers the sensitive Manolo but everyone else believes Joaquin to be a better match. Events conspire to keep couple apart and send Manolo on a quest beyond death to the three realms of the afterlife. Theres a lot going on for a 90-minute movie with a love triangle an earthly battle between villagers and bandits renditions of various pop tunes and Manolos odyssey into The Land of the Remembered The Land of the Forgotten and The Cave of Souls (presided over by The Candle Maker whose voice is provided by Ice Cube). The Book of Life moves breezily from one scene to the next keeping the pace brisk and rarely skipping a beat. The plot may be a little convoluted for younger viewers but that might not matter much. The modern-day framing device is awkward; occasionally pulling back from the main story to return to the museum can be distracting and the eventual payoff isnt worth it. Manolo whose voice (both when speaking and singing) is provided by the always-likeable Diego Luna immediately captures the viewers sympathy with his unwillingness to kill a bull in the ring. He becomes the filmmakers means to emphasize the central theme of self-determination. Zoe Saldana makes Maria cheeky and forthright; this is no damsel-in-distress. When the bandit army arrives shes the first one to grab a sword and issues the ""Once more into the breach"" speech. Channing Tatums Joaquin borrows more than a few personality traits from Beauty and the Beasts Gaston (his idea of a romantic gift is an autographed picture of himself) but he replaces the latters cruelty with a naA-ve likeability. Gaston was evil; Joaquin is just a little self-absorbed. The part of the ""cute animal"" is filled by a pig but hes not a big part of the proceedings and he doesnt talk. Del Toro and director Jorge R. Gutierrez have worked diligently to distinguish The Book of Life from every other animated film out there. It takes chances visually with every character having a Pinocchio-influenced appearance. The settings and backdrops skew far from photorealism. The incorporation of pop tunes (including an odd rendition of Rod Stewarts ""Do You Think Im Sexy?"") doesnt work as well as in (for example) Shrek; there are times when its hard to shake the feeling that Manolo is a boy band singer. In general animated films have underperformed in 2014 and while The Book of Life lacks the pedigree and broad-based appeal to reverse the trend it will be interesting to see how it performs with Latino audiences. Although del Toro and Gutierrez didnt tailor the movie to a specific demographic some of the imagery may be familiar to those with an understanding of cultural elements from south of the border. In broader terms however The Book of Life has sufficient mainstream appeal to provide solid entertainment for parents and children. Book of Life The (United States 2014) Director Jorge R.

The Book of Life is inventive storytelling with a Mexican flair review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Book of Life is inventive storytelling with a Mexican flair reviewThe Book of Life embraces Mexican folklore and mythology in telling an inventive tale loaded with humour and suspense. Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) encounters his late mother in the otherwordly Land of the Remember in the inventive animated film The Book of Life.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Oct. 16 2014The Book of LifeStarring the voices of Diego Luna Zoe Saldana Channing Tatum. Co-written and directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez. 95 minutes. Opening Friday Oct. 17 at GTA theatres. G.Ay carambaItll be interesting to see whether audiences take to The Book of Life a joyful energetic but unconventional 3-D animated adventure with a distinct Latino flavour.Article Continued BelowThe film has the imprimatur of Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro who acts as one of its producers and it shows in the playfully inventive animation courtesy of Reel FX Creative Studios. Many of the characters are either exaggeratedly rotund or the opposite and heroine Marias ponytailed mane is nearly as tall as she is.But what may cause audiences to shy away when they really ought to embrace the film is the fact that its so resolutely and unabashedly rooted in Mexican folklore and mythology.The story opens with a quintet of enfants terribles arriving for the last museum tour of the day and ready to confound even the most patient guide. A mysterious female steps into the breach taking the brood into a secret inner sanctum where they are introduced to the book of the title and the story that goes with it.In the town of San Angel Maria (voiced by Zoe Saldana) is at the centre of a rivalry between two childhood friends Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) and Joaquin (voiced by Channing Tatum).That competition for her affections prompts a wager between the spirit lord Xibalda (voiced by Ron Perlman) who longs to escape the dour underworld of forgotten souls and La Muerte (voiced by Kate del Castillo) who presides over its much livelier counterpart where souls remembered by the living celebrate a joyous afterlife.Its a concept of duo afterlife worlds that is quite different from the conventional Christian version of Heaven and Hell.Drawing on the rich Mexican tradition of wooden toys the denizens of San Angel are actually marionette-like (without the strings) right down to the articulated joints. The story itself is fairly complicated and involves dual plot lines one in which Joaquin strives to protect the people of San Angel from the ruthless Chakal and his band of outlaws and Manolos struggle to return from the underworld in his quest for Marias hand. Theres also a modern sensibility in the story which features a string of strong female characters including the proudly feminist Maria and a redefinition of what it means to be macho manifested in Manolo who despite his skills as a bullfighter refuses to perform the final act the ritual killing of the beast.Theres loads of humour throughout as well as moments of suspense before the film draws to a satisfying conclusion.With its distinctly Mexican flavour The Book of Life is certain to please audiences of all ages willing to embrace its inventive animation and imaginative story-telling.

Characters Manolo voiced by Diego Luna left and Carmen Sanchez voiced by Ana de la Reguera in a scene from ""The Book of Life."" (Twentieth Century Fox amp; Reel FX / AP) Charles Solomon The Book of Life explores Mexican folk culture. Too bad the film is so overwrought ""The Book of Life"" juxtaposes overwrought visual imagery with an undernourished familiar story -- regrettable flaws in one of the few animated films to focus on Latino characters and the rich heritage of Mexican folk culture.La Muerte (voiced by Kate del Castillo) the benevolent ruler of the Land of the Remembered and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) the treacherous lord of the Land of the Forgotten bet on the fate of three children in the mythical town of San Angel. Family tradition demands that Manolo (Diego Luna) become a bullfighter but he objects to killing and wants to be a musician. Joaquin (Channing Tatum) is determined to become a hero fighting bandits even if he cheats with Xibalbas medallion guaranteeing invulnerability. Both men are seeking the hand of the inevitably beautiful and spunky Maria (Zoe Saldana). But Joaquin acts so much like Gaston in ""Beauty and the Beast"" the ending is a forgone conclusion What heroine chooses a vainglorious soldier over a sensitive songwriter?The main characters look like puppets with hinged joints and the film might have worked better in stop-motion animation than in computer graphics. A bigger problem is that director and co-writer Jorge R. Gutierrez modeled so much of the film on traditional Day of the Dead artwork. The characters are covered with brightly colored details that quickly become distracting. When Gutierrez presents an entire realm rendered in a similarly flamboyant style the viewers eye gets lost in a labyrinth of decorated skulls balloons candles and fabrics. For ""Corpse Bride"" designer Carlos Grangel drew on Day of the Dead imagery more effectively. The artists at Pixar are working on a film with a related theme. Perhaps the dead will fare better in their next screen incarnation.

By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 16 October 2014 0421 PM Updated 16 October 2014 0422 PM Related Warner Bros. announces huge DC superhero movie lineup which includes Justice League and Wonder Woman films Alexanders Very Bad Day makes for a pretty good movie (B) It isnt easy to stand out in a crowded animation field but Dallas Reel FX has done it with The Book of Life one of the best animated films so far this year.Directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez who co-wrote the story with Douglas Langdale it draws inspiration from the Mexican Day of the Dead a time to honor departed loved ones by bringing sweet treats to altars built in their memory. It tells a story within a story that deals with friendship romance learning to trust yourself and the relationship between the living and the dead. And its funny too.The film starts with kids complaining about visiting a museum. A tour guide takes them to a special exhibit with wooden puppets and uses them to tell the story of childhood friends Manolo and Joaquin who are both in love with Maria. Two spirits make a wager over who will win the girls heart La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) who rules over the souls of the remembered and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) who oversees the sad gray land of the forgotten.As the guide speaks the children grow enthralled. The puppets fill the screen and even as they come to life they look as if theyre made of wood with smaller bits strung together for arms and legs. La Muertes face looks like a sugar skull one of the holidays traditional candies while Xibalba oozes a deliciously malevolent whoosh of green smoke.The children grow up and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) fulfills his dream of becoming a great warrior. Manolo (Diego Luna) wants to be a musician but is pushed to become a toreador. Maria (Zoe Saldana) is pressured to marry Joaquin so hell protect her village. When Marias heart turns toward Manolo Xibalba afraid of losing plays a nasty trick that sends Manolo on a dangerous but thrilling and breathtakingly animated journey through the land of the dead.The film takes many unexpected twists and turns but the best one perhaps shows that you can find heroes and allies in unexpected places including among puppets in a magical oasis in Mexico where the living bond with the dead.THE BOOK OF LIFE (A-)Directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez. PG (mild action rude humor some thematic elements and brief scary images). 95 mins. In wide release.

Gutierrez Cast Diego Luna Zoe Saldana Channing Tatum Rating PG (mild action rude humor scary images) Run time 95 minutes Related links Book of Life official web site Reel FX web site By Maricar Estrellamestrellamom2momdfw.comPosted 519pm on Thursday Oct. 16 2014 Thursday Oct. 16 2014 Thursday Oct. 16 2014 By Maricar Estrella Dia de los Muertos or the Day of the Dead may seem like a somber celebration as the focal point of a childrens animated film. However the roots of the Mexican holiday that typically spans from Halloween through All Saints Day revolve around the essence of what brings families together. The Book of Life director Jorge R. Gutierrez (Nickelodeons El Tigre The Adventures of Manny Rivera) explains in the press notes ""Its more than a holiday; its a philosophy. The core belief behind The Day of the Dead is that as long as you remember those who came before you and as long as you tell their stories cook their dishes and sing their songs -- theyre with you. They live inside your heart.""Dallas-based animation company Reel FX ( Free Birds) has weaved a wonderful tale of enchantment in The Book of Life which turns the macabre aspect of death and dying into a mythical magical kid-friendly world.The story is narrated by tour guide Mary Beth (Christina Applegate) who takes a busload of juvenile delinquents into the catacombs of a museum to relay a lesson on the Book of Life. The book tells the stories of every soul on the planet. At the center of the universe is Mexico where families on the Day of the Dead remember their dearly departed with fiestas parades and special tributes.In the small village of San Angel lifetime friends Manolo (Diego Luna) Joaquin ( Channing Tatum) and Maria (Zoe Saldana) are trying to carve their own paths in the world. Manolo comes from a long line of bullfighters and is a natural in the ring but his sensitive heart and musical soul wont allow him to commit the final act of slaying a bull. Joaquin yearns to be as courageous as his fallen-soldier father at all costs. Maria is a modern maven who is constantly being pushed to traditional ways by her overbearing father General Posada (Carlos Alazraqui). Unbeknownst to the children they become the subjects of a love triangle with otherwordly consequences. La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) the ruler of the Land of the Remembered and her unfaithful estranged husband Xibalba (a dastardly Ron Perlman) who oversees the Land of the Forgotten wager on which boy can win the heart of Maria. La Muerte believes in the fundamental goodness of humans and bets on the noble Manolo. On the other side deceitful Xibalba loves to toy with mortals and plays with Joaquins competitive streak by giving him an emerald medal that gives him everlasting life. Thus begins Manolos epic journey filled with gorgeous scenery through the Land of the Remembered where souls whose families keep them in their minds are treated to a heavenly afterlife filled with ""epic fiestas every day and all-you-can-eat churros""; the forsaken Land of the Forgotten where souls who are not remembered spend perpetuity alone; and the Cave of Souls where a goofy Candle Maker (Ice Cube) helps put the Book of Life into perspective. Produced by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro The Book of Lifes meticulous eye-popping visuals alone would be reason enough to upgrade to a 3-D seat. But once you hear the inspired renditions of Radioheads Creep and Biz Markies Just a Friend and the eclectic score from Oscar winner Gustavo Santaolalla ( Brokeback Mountain Babel) you will be hooked on this tongue-in-cheek tale of redemption and romance. The back-and-forth between the story and the narration was a bit jarring at first but became useful as a comedic tool during the darker parts of the plot. What comes to light in this film is the sweet earnestness and devotion of protagonist Manolo as when he tells Maria ""I may not be the town hero but I swear with all my heart that I will never stop loving you.""If you have to choose one Halloween treat this season this is the one to savor.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two men vie for a woman in a Mexican Day of the Dead fantasy. Rated PG (mild action rude humor some thematic elements and brief scary images) BOTTOM LINE Stunning childrens movie about death and remembrance. CAST Diego Luna Zoe Saldana Channing Tatum LENGTH 135 Death be not proud. It also isnt something most of us discuss with the very young children that are the audience for this animated film. But if anyone can start the conversation its the whimsically macabre Guillermo del Toro who as producer spearheaded director and co-writer Jorge Gutierrezs visually dazzling frosted cake of a film about the core belief behind Mexicos Day of the Dead -- that our loved ones remain alive in a way as long as we remember them. Granted death isnt an end to things in this movies conception. The afterlife is either a gloomy but hardly hellish place called the Land of the Forgotten ruled by smooth operator Xibalba (a silken-voiced Ron Perlman) or the colorful phantasmagoria called the Land of the Remembered presided over by the beautiful La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) Xibalbas angry ex-lover. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Wanting to change places Xibalba talks her into a bet over which of two boys -- Manolo (Diego Luna) or Joaquin (Channing Tatum) -- will win the love of the feisty and feminist Maria (Zoe Saldana). But Xibalba cant resist stacking the deck by giving Joaquin the Medal of Everlasting Life which prevents Joaquin from being injured or killed. He grows up to become a heroic soldier who believes his own press a tad too much while his best friend Manolo a musician at heart is forced by his father (Hector Elizondo) to become the latest in his familys line of bullfighters. Hes a natural at it except Manolo will not kill the bull. Hes readily willing to give up his own life however to spare Marias -- and once in the Land of the Remembered he discovers Xibalba has tricked him and now he must find a way back. With character designs evoking traditional Day of the Dead puppets ""The Book of Life"" nonetheless is its own vision. Funny without being frantic seamlessly switching from dry humor to slapstick it shows death as a part of life -- and judging from a preview audience of very young tykes does so in a gentle delightful way.

(Twentieth Century Fox amp; Reel FX) BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 16 2014 222 PM Title The Book of Life Film Info Animated adventure into the afterlife -- and back again. Director Jorge Gutierrez (135). PG Action scary images. Area theaters. 3-D where available. Mexican folklore gets the full 3-D animated treatment in one of the most visually dazzling films of the year. At first director Jorge Gutierrez and producer Guillermo Del Toro (director of ""Pans Labyrinth"" and ""Pacific Rim"") seem to be offering just another joke-a-minute family flick complete with lessons about believing in yourself. Soon though things heat up with blasts of color and a vibrant Mesoamerican myth. Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) yearns to be a musician but hails from a legendary line of bullfighters. Hes in love with the independent Maria (Zoe Saldana) but so is Joaquin (Channing Tatum) a soldier obsessed with his medals (and his mustache). Above it all La Muerte and Xibalba skeletal spirits from the afterlife wager over who will win Marias heart. For a kiddie flick ""The Book of Life"" pushes boundaries as the topic of death is undeniably front and center. But like Mexicos Day of the Dead the movie enjoyably and successfully mixes the macabre with the celebratory.

Gutierrezs film about a wager between gods and the Day of the Dead is a visual wonder and the story trusts its young audience with potentially difficult subjects like death.Manolo hopes to win the heart of Maria in ""The Book of Life.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsThe film offers welcome diversity in casting and story.The acting talent is deep and Gutierrez trusts his young audience.The look of the film is brilliant with rich colors and intricate details.""The Book of Life"" with its Latin-themed story and wide-ranging roster of acting talent provides a welcome shot of diversity in theaters.Thats a good thing but if thats all it was it wouldnt be enough -- it would simply be an exercise in political correctness. Instead the film directed and co-written by Jorge R. Gutierrez is a visually stunning funny movie that trusts children to deal with subject matter that many films dont specifically death.A small group of students arrives at a museum one afternoon near closing time on Nov. 2 -- the Day of the Dead. A tour guide (Christina Applegate) takes them into a side door and shows them the Book of Life which is entrusted to the Candlemaker (Ice Cube) and contains all stories; using a diorama for props she tells them one.Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | Fall movie guideIts set in a small village in Mexico where friends Manolo (Diego Luna) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) compete good naturedly for Maria (Zoe Saldana). La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) who rules the Heaven-as-a-Party Land of the Remembered and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) who commands the depressing Land of the Forgotten make a wager If Joaquin wins Marias hand the gods will swap jobs. If Manolo does Xibalba will stop meddling in the affairs of humans.Xibalba thinks nothing of cheating so he gives Joaquin a medal that provides him with strength and courage and prevents him from being hurt or killed.Her father packs the strong-willed Maria off to Europe but she returns to find the songwriting Manolo reluctantly entering the family business -- bullfighting -- and the indestructible Joaquin a military hero. And while Manolo is soulful refusing to kill the bull at the end of the fight Joaquin is more arrogant if goofy and likable (which describes Tatum in most of his roles). Like Jason Derulo shouting his name at the beginning of his songs Joaquin belts out his name before running off to battle. Its funny.The evil Chakal (Dan Navarro) is ransacking towns and theirs looks to be next. So Marias father begs her to marry Joaquin so hell stick around and protect the town. But Maria seems to like Manolo more -- he does write her love songs -- to the chagrin of her father and Xibalba the latter of whom tricks Manolo into thinking Maria has died so that he will try to join her in the Land of the Remembered.Manolo visits the Land of the Remembered. (Photo 20th Century Fox)His trip is visually amazing; the Land of the Remembered really does come alive and he meets relatives who have died. But he also discovers that hes been tricked so he has to return to the land of the living where Maria remains -- and Chakal approaches.This and everything else in the film is rendered in brilliant colors and with tremendous intricacy. The detail is beautiful.The movement between worlds is both serious-minded (you do have to die to get to the Land of the Remembered after all) and funny. One of Manolos relatives shows up while hes there and he asks what happened? ""Cholesterol"" is the reply.Pop hits like ""I Will Wait"" done mariachi-style are better than the original songs composed for the movie. Its not that the new songs detract from the movie. They just dont add much.But ""Book of the Dead"" is above all a feast for the eyes and on that front it never disappoints.AZCENTRALThe Book of Life (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Book of LifeDirector Jorge R.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan October 16 2014 Animation fans may face a tough choice at the multiplex this weekend. On some screens youll find the whimsical old-school animation of the stop-action feature ""The Boxtrolls."" Set in a subterranean world that movie tells the story of creatures who live turtle-like inside cardboard boxes. Opening on other screens youll find the somewhat less whimsical but even more eye-popping ""The Book of Life"" which uses CGI to raise the dead. Inspired by Mexican Day of the Dead figurines -- rendered in this movie as hand-carved wooden skeleton dolls -- the visually stunning film takes place partly in a kind of underworld presenting the afterlife as a candy-colored wonderland styled after such festive ghoulishness as the traditional calaveras -- or elaborately decorated skull candies -- associated with the Mexican holiday. ""What is it with Mexicans and death?"" a character asks. Thats a reasonable query for those not familiar with south-of-the-border folklore or its fixation on the afterlife. The answer as presented here is ultimately less frightening and a lot more fun than it seems despite the movies morbid premise. ""The Book of Life"" in other words is about as scary as Halloween. The main story concerns a love triangle among three best friends. Manolo (voice of Diego Luna) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) are both smitten with Maria (Zoe Saldana) the beautiful young woman with whom they grew up. Sensitive Manolo comes from a long line of bullfighters but aspires to be a mariachi musician; Joaquin is a swaggering military hero. Whom will Maria pick? Her decision suddenly becomes a lot easier when Manolo is killed by a poisonous snake the collateral victim of a rivalry between the sparring rulers of two supernatural realms La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) Queen of the Land of the Remembered and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) King of the Land of the Forgotten. Although La Muertes name literally means ""Death"" shes no Grim Reaper. The Land of the Remembered is a joyous place filled with happy spirits kept alive in the memories of those they left behind. Xibalba -- a personification of the Mayan concept of hell -- has a lot less to be jolly about. He presides over the realm of the unremembered dead. When La Muerte finds out that Xibalba took Manolos life by subterfuge in a gambit to unseat La Muerte and take over her happier kingdom our hero is granted a temporary reprieve and one last chance to win back Marias hand (and his life). The plot is a bit complicated the love triangle somewhat stale and the humor too heavily reliant on cornball gags and silly pop songs. But the movie makes up for its minor deficiencies with its gorgeous good looks and charmingly otherworldly worldview which holds death not as an end but simply the beginning of another state of being. Theres one especially lovely image expressed by a deity called the Candle Maker (Ice Cube) that imagines humans souls as flickering flames. It is not death that extinguishes them but the passing from memory. As rendered in 3-D that image takes on a kind of concrete poetry. Its comforting in a way. ""The Book of Life"" may use state-of-the-art animation but it derives its strength from the wisdom of antiquity. It only looks new but its as old as life (and death) itself.    PG. At area theaters. Contains mild action brief scatological humor and thematic material related to mortality. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Manolo (Diego Luna) encounters Carmen Sanchez (Ana de la Reguera) in ""The Book of Life."" Photo Twentieth Century Fox amp; Reel FX / Associated Press The Book of Life review Bursting with la vida 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The vibrant animated feature ""The Book of Life"" is a cheeky celebration of Mexican folklore with a solid cast an irreverent sensibility and gorgeous visuals. The story is the standard heros journey Young Manolo (Diego Luna) doesnt fit into his towns and familys traditions. His father (Hector Elizondo) wants him to continue the long line of distinguished bullfighters but he would rather sing and play guitar. Their town is guitar-shaped so guess what were meant to root for. His best friend Joaquin (Channing Tatum) wants to be a great bandit-fighting hero like his own father. The two are in love with Maria (Zoe Saldana) who is heroic in her own right. The gods of the realms of the dead (Kate del Castillo as the benevolent La Muerte and Ron Perlman as the devilish Xibalba) make a wager on their love triangle and Manolo must undergo a quest and transformation to save his love and his people. Straight-up Joseph Campbell stuff. But ""Book of Life"" does not feel rote. Its exciting funny and exuberant. The colors the music the vocal performances and the wild visual imagination all feel as if those making it were having actual fun. In his feature debut writer-director Jorge R. Gutierrez (who designed the ornate characters with his wife animator-painter Sandra Equihua) takes a devil-may-care attitude with everything from his musical choices -- largely mariachi-fied versions of pop songs such as Radioheads ""Creep"" -- to sly in-jokes (viewers should note that Ice Cube voices the deity known as the Candle Maker). Luna is likable as sensitive matador Manolo and Saldana brings her patented girl-power blend of tough and sweet to strong-willed Maria. Tatum all but steals the show as the super-macho Joaquin. One can almost hear the mustache in his voice. And what a bushy manly mustache it is. In one of the films signature moments reportedly improvised Tatums Joaquin calls out his own name as he leaps into action. Supporting performers too keep the film from lapsing into a dry anthropology lesson. The flirtation between the opposing gods really plays and in a tiny role as Manolos tiny grandmother vocal stalwart Grey DeLisle kills. The real stars though are the designers and animators. For a mystical skeleton La Muerte is downright foxy with her anything-but-dead come-hither eyes and enormous scarlet sombrero. Xibalba alternates between goofy and scary with his dread angel wings antlers and ectoplasm. This world is populated by marionettes without strings. The stylized detail of their individual wood grains; the lively reflections in their moist reactive eyes; the crazy flood of color -- all in an off-kilter universe that merges earthly paradise with mystical underworlds -- make for a unique visual feast. ""The Book of Life"" is proof that knowing where youre going is no impediment to enjoying the journey. There are no great surprises no shocking reveals (except to the characters themselves). But theres so much to appreciate along the way that its a real page-turner. Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer. E-mail datebookletterssfchronicle.com. Twitter michaelordona.

Jody Mitori A scene from ""The Book of Life"" Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been friends in the Mexican village of San Angel since childhood but they couldnt be more different. Manolo comes from a family of bullfighters but would rather be a singer-guitarist. Joaquin is hailed as a military hero but is also something of a blowhard.What Manolo and Joaquin share is a love for the free-spirited Maria (Zoe Saldana) whom they have known all their lives. She cares for them both but hasnt turned to either for romance. Not yet anyway.The rivalry for Marias heart has not gone unnoticed by two gods -- La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) of the Land of the Remembered and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) of the Land of the Forgotten -- who make a high-stakes bet as to which of her suitors will prevail. Can Manolo fulfill his dream to be a musician? Can Joaquin save San Angel from a fierce bandit? And who will Maria choose?Inspired by Mexicos Day of the Dead holiday and produced by Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"") ""The Book of Life"" is a visually stunning animated tale that should appeal to children even if they dont always understand whats going on. Director Jorge R. Gutierrez conjures images that would likely captivate viewers even without the 3D enhancements. And the score including original songs by Gustavo Santaolalla and Paul Williams and Latin-tinged cover versions of pop tunes is first-rate. But the screenplay (co-written by Gutierrez and Doug Langdale) is unusually complicated for a kids film and a framing device in which a museum tour guide relates the tale of Manolo Maria and Joaquin to a group of schoolchildren comes across as an unnecessary distraction. Fortunately Luna Saldana and Tatum prove to be ideal vocal choices for the romantic triangle.""The Book of Life"" is a flawed but intriguing new chapter in animation.What ""The Book of Life""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 135  Content Mild action rude humor thematic elements scary images Tags Book Of Life Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Jorge R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Book Of Life is gorgeous. Its colorful visual palette is based on Mexican folk art and Dia De Los Muertos imagery a vibrant alternative to typical witches-and-pumpkins Halloween fare. The characters move around in a thoroughly realized universe full of imaginative and beautifully rendered detail. Too bad the rest of it isnt more interesting.But more about the look Produced (but not directed) by Guillermo Del Toro The Book Of Life is highly stylized and the protagonists are designed to look like jointed wooden puppets (if alive) or skeletons (if dead) rather than ""real"" animated people. The bad guys like a monster made from the skeletons of hundreds of slain bulls are menacing and covered in spikes and the good guys like the heroines pet pig Chuy are downright kawaii. The animation is stunning overall but particularly in its use of texture--everything from the weave of fabric in a dress to the sugar-coated arms of death goddess La Muerte (Kate Del Castillo) is meticulously rendered. Curiously for a film that put so much effort into its visuals the 3-D effects feel like an afterthought. Ultimately what drags The Book Of Life down is its insistence on trying to update an (original) folkloric story for a contemporary audience. In practice this means adding some pop-cultural touches that only serve to take the viewer out of the fantastic setting. First of all celebrity voices that most nonessential of modern animation trends are all over this thing. Most of them blend into the background (as they should) but Channing Tatum miscast as a dashing war hero sticks out like a sore thumb.Second and more egregious is the films diegetic use of contemporary pop songs. Cheech Marin as a drunken mariachi singing Biz Markies ""Just A Friend"" has its charms but when the wannabe-troubadour hero Manolo (Diego Luna) starts singing Radioheads ""Creep"" (taking out the ""hell""s and ""fuck""s of course) the cognitive dissonance is too much to bear. Similarly its always nice to hear the opening strains of Ennio Morricones ""The Ecstasy Of Gold"" used here in a bullfighting scene--but then the beat drops. (The films original music by Brokeback Mountain composer Gustavo Santaolalla is pretty forgettable too.)The Dia De Los Muertos influence is clearly felt in The Book Of Lifes attitude toward death. In the film death is not an end to be feared but a joyous opportunity to return to the loving embrace of venerated ancestors. This concept with its accompanying themes of family and remembrance is much more interesting than the Americanized A-plot which is all about overcoming your fears and being yourself and making your own destiny and every other lesson from every kids movie ever. In trying to appeal to the broadest audience possible The Book Of Life loses touch with the proud tradition that inspired it and becomes just another cliched tale of true love triumphant.

THEATER REVIEW The Book of Life Musical skulls. Running time 85 minutes. Rated PG (some scary sequences). At the E-Walk 34th St. others. Just in time for Mexicos Day of the Dead holiday comes this gloriously colorful animated musical which almost (but not quite) makes up in visuals what it lacks in snappy dialogue. Produced by Guillermo del Toro ""The Book of Life"" tells the story of a mythical love triangle and two immortal beings who gamble on its outcome. Manolo (Diego Luna) born into a family of bullfighters wants to be a musician while his buddy Joaquin (Channing Tatum) comes from military stock and is totally comfortable with that. Both have crushes on their friend Maria (Zoe Saldana) a firebrand with a soft spot for animal rights. Placing wagers on which guy shell eventually marry are two gods of the afterlife Xibalba (Ron Perlman) and La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) who rule opposing kingdoms The former is king of the land of the forgotten while La Muertes territory is for all the souls celebrated by their loved ones each year on the Mexican holiday. Framing this story is a modern-day museum tour guide (Christina Applegate) giving a VIP tour of a Day of the Dead wing to hold the interest of a bunch of juvenile delinquents (""So . . . many . . . skulls"" one of them crows delightedly). As the plot progresses passable songs are sung and forays are made into the land of the dead -- including a visit with the Candle Maker (Ice Cube) a God-type with a beard made of clouds. Though its trappings feel highly traditional -- the characters themselves resemble old-timey Mexican wooden dolls an admirably unique and eye-catching choice -- the story gradually finds its footing as a modernized tale. There may be a lot of talk about Maria getting married but shes demonstrably her own woman; likewise despite some acrobatic bullfighting flourishes here and there the film eventually takes a firm stance against the practice. (It does engage in one pet peeve of mine throwing around outdated terms like ""mankind"" and ""the affairs of man""; I like to imagine a generation of ""Frozen"" fanatics giving this practice a big thumbs down). Its also a shame to have Channing Tatum in a role -- even an unseen one-- and not let him loose a bit more than this movie does; likewise the affable Luna. Both are fine as is Saldana but their dialogue never rises beyond the level of faintly amusing. First-time director Jorge R. Gutierrez does have some fun with the whole concept of making a fairly creepy holiday into palatable childrens viewing -- at one point one of the tour guides tiny charges gasps ""What kind of story IS this?

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 152 p.m. EDT October 16 2014Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) is a toreador caught in a romantic rivalry.(Photo Twentieth Century Fox amp; Reel FX AP)The hectic story is not nearly as imaginative as the vibrant visuals in The Book of Life an animated tale that spins off Mexicos Day of the Dead holiday. But the dizzying intricate imagery is so beautiful and the Latin-inspired songs catchy enough that the overall effect is often enchanting ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide).Awash in evocative Mexican folk art the story delves cheerfully into death and the afterlife subjects often avoided in family movies deemed too mournful and complex for children. But the storys arc is often less stepped in myth than Disney-style lore. A romantic sub-plot feels too similar to Beauty and the Beastss Belle and Gaston.The 3-D computer animation has a handsome hand-hewn look. Characters celebrate Latino heritage and Day of the Dead festivitieLifes messages are hard to fault stressing the importance of keeping alive memories of dead loved ones and being true to ones heart. A framing device with a museum tour guide (Christina Applegate) imparting cultural lessons to rowdy visiting students is used to elucidate customs such as honoring the deceased by leaving sugar skulls favorite foods flowers and other gifts at their graves.s so warmly that its almost possible to ignore the storys lapses and excesses. The museum opening also sets the stage for an unusual design in the characters since the schoolkids first encounter Day of the Dead wooden dolls on display. When animated these characters retain their charming cobbled look.Set in a small MMaria (voiced by Zoe Saldana) is fought over in The Book of Life (Photo AP)exican town the story centers on a contest for the heart of the spunky Maria (Zoe Saldana). The combatants are Manolo (Diego Luna) a musician whose father insists he follow family tradition and become a bullfighter and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) a much-decorated soldier.A pair of spirit gods also has a stake in the competition each backing a different admirer. Kindly La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) rules the celebratory Land of the Remembered and backs the sweet-natured Manolo; the macho Joaquin is the choice of Xibalba (Ron Perlman) whose domain is the dreary Land of the Forgotten.The two romantic rivals must also stave off nasty bandit Chakal (Dan Navarro) in a dull story segment that feels like padding. Its hard not to root for the sensitive singer Manolo who is a capable toreado (and resists killing bulls). But fighting to win the hand of a beautiful maiden is a rather retro message even if the 18-year-old in question is no distressed damsel and knows kung fu.Ads hype the production involvement of director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy Pans Labyrinth) but the film also invites comparisons to Tim Burtons Corpse Bride whose visuals were influenced by Day of the Deads colorful aesthetic.While the story is not as mythic or fanciful as it seeks to be its predictability is trumped by the films beauty. 68 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1pdtsgk",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/15/book-of-life-review/17285821/,200,thebookoflife(2014)20,thebookoflife(2014),usatoday

Sure there are skulls but theyre made of sugar. Yes there are graves but theyre covered with marigolds. Even the skeletons are dressed to blend in with the (still-fleshy) crowd. And its all in the name of honoring your beloved dead relatives. Director Jorge Gutierrez is hip to the visual possibilities setting the bulk of the action in a world of animated wooden dolls (think LEGO Movie only less polished) and riotous phantasmagoria.

Realistically you shouldnt expect penetrating life lessons from a film where balladeer Manolo (Diego Luna) digs deep inside himself to serenade sassy heroine Maria (Zoe Saldana) but only dredges up Hallmark Card-ready sentimentality a constellation of candles an instantly forgettable sunset and a bad cover of ""Cant Help Falling in Love."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But The Book of Lifes plot hinges on Manolo and war-hero Joaquins (Channing Tatum) romantic rivalry making pseudo-empowered Maria -- she knows kung fu -- a human prize. Manolo and Joaquins contest is encouraged by Xibalba and La Muerte (Ron Perlman and Kate del Castillo) dueling rulers of the afterlife who bet on who will wed Maria. The ghosts of Manolos family further validate his quest by returning to help him on the Dia de los Muertos. The films rote right-makes-might fantasy wouldnt be so obnoxious if pandering to the lowest common denominator wasnt its default mode. You might be able to forgive the Shrek-worthy jukebox soundtrack including covers of Radioheads ""Creep"" and Biz Markies ""Just a Friend."" But you cant escape the Speedy Gonzalez-level ethnic humor -- the filmmakers literally put facial hair and sombreros on everything including a mustachioed globe and its sombrero-shaped spiral galaxy home. Instead of swinging for the fences The Book of Life bunts and still strikes out.

Gutierrez animated film produced by Guillermo del Toro is inspired by the Mexican holiday the Day of the Dead Its not surprising that a companion art book to the new animated film directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez and produced by Guillermo del Toro has already been released. Steeped in Mexican folk art and inspired by that countrys holiday the Day of the Dead The Book of Life is a visually stunning effort that makes up for its formulaic storyline with an enchanting atmosphere that sweeps you into its fantastical world or in this case three worlds. The film which will have an obvious special appeal to Hispanic audiences should prove a winner for 20th Century Fox Animation. Bookended by amusing contemporary segments in which a sassy museum tour guide (Christina Applegate) hosts a group of skeptical school kids the story concerns the romantic triangle among the free-spirited Maria (Zoe Saldana) and her two suitors Manolo (Diego Luna) the scion of a long line of bullfighters who really wants to be a singer/guitarist; and the vainglorious Joaquin (Channing Tatum) a military hero who struts around with a huge display of medals on his chest. The plot is set in motion by squabbling married gods La Muerta (Kate del Castillo) and Xibabla (del Toro regular Ron Perlman) who make a wager as to which of the two men Maria will choose. La Muerta the ruler of the Land of the Remembered places her bet on Manolo while Xibabla who oversees the dark Land of the Forgotten puts his faith in Joaquin and thinks nothing of exerting his influence to determine the outcome. Read More The Art of the Book of Life Preview How to Design a Villain To that end he tricks Manolo into thinking that Maria has ventured into the Land of the Remembered so the love-struck suitor sets off after her. While initially joyful to be introduced to the magical world containing all of his ancestors Manolo is soon chagrined to discover that Maria is not there and sets off to find La Muerta to help him in his quest stopping first at the Cave of Souls to consult with the Candle Maker (Ice Cube) whos in charge of The Book of Life. Meanwhile the Land of the Living is beset by the villainous monster Chakal (Dan Navarro) and his gang of bandits with the inevitable battle affecting the destinies of all concerned. Acerbically commenting on the proceedings from the sidelines is the whiskered elderly Grandma hilariously voiced by Grey Griffin. While the screenplay by Gutierrez and Douglas Langdale may prove a little too convoluted for younger viewers they will surely be swept up by the magical visuals depicting the three worlds and their -- literally not figuratively -- wooden inhabitants (Tatums Joaquin is again literally square-jawed). Its frames packed with vibrantly colorful detailed imagery inspired by Latin American folklore and art the computer-animated film looks particularly impressive in 3D. Read More Book of Life Fashion Collection Celebrates Mexican Art (Exclusive) Although thankfully devoid of the sort of winking pop culture-inflected humor prevalent in so many current animated films The Book of Life provides much amusement with its inspired musical choices. Besides the original score and songs by two-time Oscar winner Gustavo Santaolalla (Brokeback Mountain Babel) and veteran songwriter Paul Williams there are fun mariachi-flavored versions of such pop hits as Mumford and Sons ""I Will Wait"" Radioheads ""Creep"" and Rod Stewarts ""Do You Think Im Sexy?"" among others. Luna and Saldana provide their own singing with impressive results. Adding further regional flavor is the supporting voice cast which includes fun contributions by Placido Domingo Hector Elizondo Cheech Marin Gabriel Iglesias and Danny Trejo.

Gutierrez is a visual treat. The visuals outshine the story in ""The Book of Life"" a lively animated tale that mixes age-old myths with todays toon tropes. But what lovely visuals they are. The feature debut of smallscreen animator Jorge R. Gutierrez (co-creator of Nickelodeons ""El Tigre The Adventures of Manny Rivera"") proves to be perfectly charming in relaying the tale of a lopsided love triangle set against the backdrop of Mexicos Day of the Dead holiday. And yet it hardly matters what the characters are saying (or occasionally singing) when their warmly handcrafted appearance keeps stealing the spotlight. Opening domestically three weeks after Focus/Laikas ""The Boxtrolls"" and three weeks ahead of Disneys ""Big Hero 6"" ""Book"" should have time to carve out its own space in the family entertainment marketplace and could become a significant sleeper worldwide especially if Latin audiences respond to the pics universal yet culturally specific delights.SEE MORE Annecy Film Festival As if to ensure every viewer has a window into the story the central narrative is framed as a legend being told by a motherly museum tour guide (voiced by Christina Applegate) to a group of rebellious school kids on Nov. 2 the Day of the Dead. While that choice initially plays like an unnecessary distancing device it also reinforces the mythic quality of what were watching (and eventually gives the young listeners the opportunity to offer a few adorable asides). Plus it explains why everyone in the tour guides tale looks like a handmade wooden toy -- a captivating visual conceit. Ever since they were children music-loving bullfighter Manolo (Diego Luna) and burly bandit vanquisher Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been enamored with the same girl feisty free spirit Maria (Zoe Saldana). So theyre equally heartbroken when Marias unconventional behavior gets her shipped off to Europe by her strict father (Carlos Alazraqui). Its not until her 18th birthday that she returns to the town of San Angel to reignite the rivalry between Manolo and Joaquin each hoping to be the one to marry their mutual true love. As our narrator explains theres even more at stake in this competition than Marias heart. Each young man has been backed by a different deity of the spirit realm. Sensitive Manolo has been selected by the kindly La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) who rules over the joyful Land of the Remembered. Manly Joaquin is the choice of her devious husband Xibalba (Ron Perlman) who oversees the miserable Land of the Forgotten. A victory for Team Manolo means Xibalba can no longer meddle in the lives of humans but a victory for Team Joaquin will banish La Muerte to the Forgotten realm and release Xibalba to lord over the Remembered. No fair guessing in advance who wins (and at least there are a few twists along the way). If the idea of two men fighting over a pretty lady seems a bit retrograde in the post-""Frozen"" era of animation Gutierrez and co-writer Doug Langdale make it clear that Maria is no shrinking violet. Shes the one in control -- despite her fathers clear preference for Joaquin if only to help save the city from rampaging metal-encased monster Chakal (Dan Navarro). Imbued with an inner fire thanks to Saldanas impassioned vocal turn Maria also stands strong for her pet cause (literally she loves animals and adopts a pig about to be slaughtered) and proves capable of inspiring the townspeople with stirring rhetoric at pivotal moments. Sure the pic stacks its soulmate deck firmly in favor of Manolo -- he refuses to kill the bulls he fights composes original love songs on the guitar Maria gifted him with an inscription reading ""Always play from the heart"" (the music is courtesy of Gustavo Santaolalla lyrics by Paul Williams) and is keenly voiced by the ever-likable Luna (who also croons the songs) -- but the choice is up to Maria. To that end the pompous Joaquin overcomes obvious comparisons to ""Beauty and the Beast"" villain Gaston with a healthy dose of Tatums signature affable charm (one possible factor in the otherwise decidedly inauthentic casting choice). That helps to lend at a least a modicum of suspense to the romantic drama. And it only increases once Manolo finds himself on a temporary detour in the afterlife where hes reunited with his deceased relatives on a quest to find La Muerte and return to Maria. Between the framing device multiple musical numbers (including a handful of brief Latin-infused covers of recognizable pop hits) three leads two supernatural realms and entire vibrant village of San Angel ""The Book of Life"" is undoubtedly stuffed with more business than its fleet kid-friendly running time can properly handle. Yet Gutierrezs confident delivery of the material remains so buoyant and passionately felt throughout that he almost gets away with it. Its not until a final epic battle with the otherwise superfluous Chakal that the burden of trying to play to as wide an audience as possible finally gets the best of him. Fortunately thats not what audiences will remember. Repping a major step forward for Dallas-based Reel FX Animation Studios (after their anemic feature bow on last years ""Free Birds"") the beautifully rendered CG animation brings an unusually warm and heartfelt quality to the high-tech medium and emerges as the films true calling card. Creative character design by Gutierrez and wife Sandra Equihua is a consistent treat especially the playful touches in the winged Xibalba and regal La Muerte and the intricately designed worlds rep a modest triumph for production designer Simon Valdimir Varela. The ravishing color explosion when Manolo enters the Land of the Remembered single-handedly justifies the pics 3D presentation. ""The Book of Life"" also marks the most significant role yet for filmmaker Guillermo del Toro in an animated project. A frequent consultant and executive producer for DreamWorks Animation (where Gutierrez originally had this film set up before creative differences led him elsewhere) Del Toro was clearly a hands-on creative producer here bolstering the visual aesthetic of a production that can more comfortably introduce a younger generation to his darkly fanciful sensibilities. There would certainly be cause for excitement should Del Toro follow in the footsteps of fellow live-action visionary Tim Burton and helm his own animated feature.

Its ""Vladimir"" Reply J T H says October 11 2014 at 628 am The reviewer has confused the roles of Manolo (Diego Luna) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Reply geoffberkshire says October 11 2014 at 920 am The mistake has been corrected thanks. Reply Meg Ryan says October 11 2014 at 624 am I THINK YOU SHOULD rewrite the article-Joquin is Pompous and Xibalba roots for him as La Muerte roots for Manolo who is a bullfighter/musician.

We expect youngsters to understand concepts of heteronormative courtship and romance from their earliest exposure to fairy tales and Disney movies yet the one inevitable thing theyre going to face in life is too often hidden away as a taboo subject. Along comes ""The Book of Life"" a colorful and vibrant animated story based around the Mexican Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebration that magical occasion when the spirits of the departed return to earth to receive the gifts and remembrances of the living. Under the guidance of producer Guillermo del Toro the movie champions honoring the memories of those we have lost while also advocating that the living must craft their lives to follow their own design and not the desire of others. See video Channing Tatum Diego Luna Vie for Zoe Saldanas Heart in Stunning New Book of Life Trailer The story begins with a museum guide (voiced by Christina Applegate) telling a group of rowdy schoolchildren the story of the Day of the Dead and how the Candlemaker (Ice Cube) keeps track of the living while the beautiful La Muerte (Kate del Castillo ""Under the Same Moon"") and her trickster husband Xibalba (Ron Perlman) rule over the realms of the dead. Wanting to leave the miserable Land of the Forgotten Xibalba makes a wager with La Muerte hoping to swap for her throne in the Land of the Remembered. They observe three childhood friends -- the wise and mischievous Maria the musically-inclined Manolo and little tough guy Joaquin -- and bet on which of the boys will grow up to marry Maria. La Muerte chooses the kind-hearted Manolo; to help Joaquin win Xibalba gives the boy a medal that grants whoever wears it strength and courage (and unbeknownst to Joaquin eternal life). Maria is sent away from Mexico (""the center of the universe"" the film tells us) to study and when she returns as an adult (Zoe Saldana) she picks up where she left off with her childhood sweethearts. Manolo (Diego Luna) plays the guitar on the sly but his father Carlos (Hector Elizondo) has pushed him into the family business of bullfighting while the bravery and heroics of Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have made him a legendary soldier. Also read SGN Launches Mobile Game Collaboration With Fox Digital Tied to Guillermo Del Toros Book of Life While Marias father pressures her to marry Joaquin so he will protect their small town from the evil Chacal (who killed Joaquins military-officer father) she finds herself more drawn to Manolo. To keep from losing the bet Xibalba plays a trick on Manolo that will send him to the underworld and back in order to win the hand of his beloved with the help of a dozen or so dead ancestors. ""The Book of Life"" serves up a visual feast in every frame -- since the museum guide is telling the story with wooden figurines all the characters have articulated joints shoulders and fingers that make them resemble marionettes yet theyve all got expressive eyes and faces even when they are rendered as skeletons in the afterlife. Director Jorge R. Gutierrez (a veteran of TV shows like ""Mad"" and ""El Tigre"") creates one memorable world after another from the kids in the museum (standing in front of a glorious Latin American diorama) to the small town where the action unfolds to the weird and wonderful explosions of color in the Land of the Remembered. Also read FXs The Strain Renewed for Season 2 The script (by Gutierrez and Douglas Landale) touches on poignant moments where lost loved ones are remembered but those sad scenes are leavened with lots of comedy. (Vain soldier Joaquin for instance bounds off to battle yelling ""!Joaquiiiiiiiin"") I wish the songs by Gustavo Santaolalla (whose score is just right) were more memorable and that the film didnt lead up to the requisite third act Big Fight that so many cartoons obligatorily provide but ""The Book of Life"" manages to be genuinely surprising and engrossing. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" may have October 31 and December 25 on lockdown but now November 2 gets its own cartoon that both kids and parents will want to revisit every year.
