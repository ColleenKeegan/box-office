Hayden Christensen atoning for ""Attack of the Clones"" is smarmily terrific as the unctuous Glass and gifted chameleon Peter Sarsgaard as the stiff unpopular editor who exposed him is a refreshing movie hero. Writer-director Ray has a no-fuss style that is quietly thoroughly gripping. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ElephantDirected by Gus Van SantThough it ends with an eruption of violence reminiscent of the Columbine massacre Van Sants Cannes prize winner has no interest in explaining school violence. Instead he offers a lyrical elliptical portrait of a suburban high school (using nonprofessional actors) that captures the texture of teenage life with haunting verisimilitude. Theres much to argue with but this unconventional oddly beautiful film resonates in unexpected ways.ElfDirected by Jon FavreauTowering over the elves he grew up with in Santas workshop Buddy (Will Ferrell) has to come to grips with the fact that hes really a human. So he sets off to New York to meet his real father and discovers that a sugar-eating insanely friendly man in a green elf suit and yellow tights who claims to be a personal friend of Santa Clauss doesnt exactly go over in Manhattan. Ferrell is a hoot. So is much of this witty holiday family entertainment which up until the end when the ""true spirit of Christmas"" must be reaffirmed happily favors slapstick over treacle.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Boston.com / Aamp;E / Movies / REVIEW Ferrell is joy to watch in Elf Movies    Dining/Food    Local events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies REVIEW Ferrell is joy to watch in Elf By Christy Lemire AP Entertainment Writer 11/6/2003 Buddy the Elf a thirtysomething man whos enjoyed a blissfully naive existence cobbling toys at the North Pole craves any food loaded with sugar. ADVERTISEMENT He covers a plate of pasta with jelly beans Pop Tart pieces and maple syrup then gleefully crams fistfuls of the glucose-infused glop into his mouth. And thats just for breakfast.""Elf"" director Jon Favreau goes easier on the sweet stuff however. The ""Swingers"" director has made a Christmas movie thats almost edgy. And as Buddy Will Ferrell brings a boundless boyish enthusiasm to the role thats infectious.Its a joy to watch Ferrell in action -- and hes constantly in action thanks to his perpetual sugar rush -- because he seems to have genuine affection for this character. He never plays down to Buddy never treats him like hes slow or goofy. He plays him like an innocent kid stuck inside a 6-foot-3 mans body and he makes you want to wrap your arms around him and protect him from the Scrooges outside the walls of Santas workshop.As a ""Saturday Night Live"" alum he clearly has no qualms about making a fool of himself for the big laugh.""Elf"" begins with a flashback narrated by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) which explains how Buddy sneaked into Santas toy sack as an orphaned infant on Christmas Eve. Upon returning to the North Pole Santa (a wonderfully unjolly Ed Asner) decides the boy should stay and the elves raise him as one of their own.After a lifetime of crouching through tiny elfin doorways and squatting on tiny elfin chairs Buddy is shocked to learn hes not an elf -- hes a grown man with a father in New York City who doesnt know he exists. So he sets out to find Walter (James Caan) even though the callous childrens book publisher is on the naughty list.David Berenbaums script really picks up and the best sight gags and fish-out-of-water jokes come after Buddy hits Manhattan (which he reaches by creeping carefully through the Lincoln Tunnel). He bounces through the city in his uniform -- festive green jacket yellow tights pointy green hat -- spinning through revolving doors and waving at hardened New Yorkers.""I just like to smile"" he responds when asked why he always appears so happy. ""Smilings my favorite.""Walter thinks Buddys a nut when he shows up in full yuletide splendor at his Empire State Building publishing office but has to accept him when a blood test proves this person is indeed his son. Walters wife and son (Mary Steenburgen and Daniel Tay among the solid supporting cast) eventually warm to him too.Speaking of the supporting cast many of the choices are totally genius. Besides Newhart and Asner Zooey Deschanel charms as the fair-haired object of Buddys affections and Andy Richter and Kyle Gass have some funny scenes as Walters useless underlings.But as an egomaniacal childrens book author -- a dwarf whom Buddy mistakes for an elf -- Peter Dinklage seizes the scene hes in and doesnt let go. It would have been a disarming performance anyway but its especially forceful compared to the quiet dignity he brought this year to his starring role in ""The Station Agent.""Sure ""Elf"" feels a little too feel-good at the end but what do you expect? Its a Christmas movie Anything else would be the cinematic equivalent of finding coal in your stocking.""Elf"" a New Line Cinema release is rated PG for some mild rude humor and language.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Early in the mediocre holiday comedy Elf as North Pole craftsmen busily prepare Monopoly sets and Etch-A-Sketches for kids on the ""nice"" list two elves lament the decline of Christmas spirit in the modern world. Apparently one of them reports many people think theres no Santa Claus and that parents really provide the toys on Christmas morning. ""Impossible"" the other one says. Like many moments in Elf this exchange is meant to reassure children while casting a conspiratorial wink to the adults in the audience but the joke is so transparent that it seems more likely to add to preteen disillusionment. A kissing cousin to 1988s notorious Scrooged-another Christmas fable that grapples with New York City cynicism-Elf clearly doesnt believe the yuletide sentiments its peddling which doesnt affect the comedy but torpedoes the heartwarming ending. The remainder of the film mostly hangs on Will Ferrell whose wide-open face and amusingly gawky frame generally promise more laughs than he seems capable of delivering. But here his gleeful near-psychotic enthusiasm carries the day wiping some of the flop sweat off director Jon Favreaus aggressively wacky and ingratiating plea for holiday cheer. Not since fellow man-child Adam Sandler donned a searing blue suit for Punch-Drunk Love has a costume done so much for an actor In his oversized green smock with yellow tights and pointy shoes Ferrells fish-out-of-water character looks almost three-dimensional and his already-imposing presence balloons into something like The Hulk. An orphan accidentally scooped up by Santa (Ed Asner) and raised by elves at the North Pole Ferrell doesnt realize that hes human until his adopted father (Bob Newhart) explains why he isnt hitting the toy-making quotas of his pint-sized peers. When he journeys to the Empire State Building to seek out birth father James Caan Ferrell finds a cold embittered Grinch who doesnt have time for his own family let alone a slap-happy freak claiming to be his long-lost son. Cast out into the streets Ferrell finds refuge at a department store where he works for a rummy Santa-for-hire with the charming Zooey Deschanel. In spite of his faults as a filmmaker (choppy pacing indifferent camera placement an overeager need to please) Favreau and his producers have impeccable taste in casting. In addition to the inspired choices of Asner and Newhart as well as Caan and indie darling Deschanel Elf also pairs Andy Richter with Tenacious Ds Kyle Gass brings back the underappreciated Mary Steenburgen and taps The Station Agents Peter Dinklage for a scene-stealing cameo. The cast wrings laughs out of David Berenbaums script as if it were a damp washcloth but even they have trouble selling frenetic button-pushing as the Christmas spirit. Its one thing to believe Will Ferrell as a man who thinks hes an elf; its another to believe in Santa Claus too.

Comments click to enlarge Elf Video Rated PG  97 minutes  2003 Twinkly Will Ferrell plays a man raised at the north pole who returns to his native New York City to bond with his long-lost father (James Caan looking rather angry about the state of his career). Director Jon Favreau pitches this secular fable (2003) at the level of the old Rankin-Bass TV specials which results in a smarmy and unconvincing family story and leaves Ferrell to carry the ball. A job in the Gimbels toy department gives him a cute cynical love interest (Zooey Deschanel) and a chance to run amok (assaulting the fake Santa in the public interest) but the film soon bogs down in fake hugs and a fakier climax involving Santa (Ed Asner) and his downed sled. David Berenbaum wrote the script; with Bob Newhart unusually funny on the big screen as Ferrells adoptive father. By J.R.

Buddy (Ferrell) is different because hes a human brought back to the North Pole as a baby when he strayed into the old boys sack during the Christmas run. Hes been raised in the traditional elfin ways of industrious good humour but now its time for him to venture to distant New York and discover his real father is a grumpy publisher (Caan) who naturally thinks his son is a dangerous loony. Must be the tights and the pointy hat. What follows is a fairly predictable fish out of water romp with seasonal bells on. Nevertheless Favreau delivers the cornball sentiments with an adept balance of irony and sincerity sprinkling felicities in the margins - cult crooner Leon Redbone voicing a stop-motion snowman indie fave Zooey Deschanel as the department store helper giving Ferrell understandable tingles and a particularly successful running gag enshrining the significance of etch-a-sketch in elf culture. Some humour might sail over the heads of the very young but theres a higher chuckle rate for the grown-ups than much dread family fare.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Christmas Movies Entertainment News Few contemporary comedies have the courage of conviction that Jon Favreaus ""Elf"" does. In ""Elf"" Will Ferrell plays Buddy a rather tall human orphan who has been raised at Santas workshop in the North Pole to believe hes an elf -- forget that he has to fold himself in half to sit on an elf toilet seat and cant get through a doorway without bumping his head on an elf lintel. It begins to dawn on Buddy that somethings amiss when at work on the Etch A Sketch assembly line with the other elves he realizes that hes just no good at making toys. His adoptive father Papa Elf (played by Bob Newhart) breaks the bad news Buddys real mom was very young when he was born (a fact thats telegraphed to us by the black-and-white photo Papa Elf holds up of a pair of 60s folkie-student types with long hair and glowing guileless expressions). She put him up for adoption and later died. Buddys father is still alive -- he lives in New York and works as all human beings in New York ought to work in the Empire State Building -- although as Ed Asners Santa Claus warns Buddy ""Hes on the naughty list."" (He also happens to be played with a very naughty degree of faux crabbiness by James Caan.) Still an elfs gotta do what an elfs gotta do and so Buddy steps Rudolph-style onto an ice floe and heads toward an uncertain future in which hell unravel his past. Provided he doesnt get bumped off by a taxicab first. ""Elf"" may sound like a comedy for children that grown-ups can enjoy too. But I think its the other way around Favreau doesnt work overtime to insert winking nudging gags that will make the grown-ups laugh the sort of thing that the highly overpraised ""Shrek"" was loaded with. Instead Favreau ignores the fact that the premise of ""Elf"" is ridiculous and the movie automatically slips into its own elegant natural logic. ""Elf"" works because its completely refreshingly free of ironic detachment When Favreau shows us those rosy-cheeked elves tinkering away happily in their workshop he gives it to us straight. Yes they really are that happy. (A lesser director would show us a hidden bottle of hooch in an elf filing cabinet the suggestion being that allegedly childish things have to be jazzed up for adult consumption.) Whats more when youve got Newhart playing an elf dad with perfect seriousness and Asner as a vaguely annoyed Santa (and the two of them are wonderful) theres no need for disingenuous in-jokes. Asner and Newhart are actors whose style and demeanor give them a certain recognizability. But whether youre hip to the history of their TV work or not their personalities serve both the characters they play and the larger purpose of the movie. This is acting not gimmickry. Favreau gets the mood and tone and look of ""Elf"" just right. (It was shot by Greg Gardiner and the production designer is Rusty Smith. The two of them know how to draw maximum energy from bright colors without allowing them to look garish -- visually as well as spiritually ""Elf"" is the opposite of the 2000 ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."") The script by David Berenbaum is tight and lively and gives the actors plenty to work with. Ferrell looks so right in his tights and silly embroidered cutaway coat that when he shows up in a suit and tie and overcoat two-thirds of the way through the picture the effect is jarring and wrong -- thats how much ""Elf"" acclimatizes us to its own willfully ridiculous universe. You dont usually think of Ferrell as having the face of an alien naif but his demeanor in ""Elf"" is pleasantly gullible -- he somehow looks as if hes been smacked silly with a giant fish. When he discovers that a department-store Santa -- the store is recognizable as Macys but it has been renamed nostalgically ""Gimbels"" -- isnt really Santa he hisses with elfish self-righteousness ""You sit on a throne of lies"" You Might Also Like Ferrell pulls off some marvelous physical stuff as well Buddy negotiates his first-ever escalator by stretching his legs between the moving steps in a giant split. And he and his love interest Jovie (played with great charm by zonked-out snow angel Zooey Deschanel) have a rapport that resembles the antics of gamboling kittens more than it does real-life dating -- which is precisely what makes it so much fun. ""Elf"" moves along on swift little felt feet stumbling just a bit in the last third You feel that at certain points Favreau wasnt quite sure how to shape the material. Theres a sequence in which a hotheaded arrogant childrens book writer (played with surly relish by Peter Dinklage) who happens to be a dwarf beats the heck out of Buddy who has of course mistaken him for a fellow ""little person."" The sequence has a rough-and-tumble ""Three Stooges"" quality that doesnt suit the movie as perfectly as it might. The pictures climax too feels a bit misshapen as if the story needed to be wrapped up fast and big and no one was quite sure how to do it. But the more Ive thought about ""Elf"" in the days since Ive seen it the more its minor flaws recede and the more its casual brilliance steps to the forefront. What really resonates are things like Favreaus choice of music and the way he uses it to enhance what were seeing on-screen as opposed to attempting to clobber us into a heightened state of feeling. (When Buddy first arrives in Manhattan his exploration of this strange and enormous new village is set to Louis Primas ""Pennies From Heaven."" And Deschanel -- who incidentally can really sing -- and Ferrell get a lovely tossed-off duet on ""Baby Its Cold Outside."") Then theres the way Buddy explains to anyone wholl listen how he made his way to Manhattan ""Then I crossed the Sea of Swirly Twirly Gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln Tunnel."" Or the way once hes gotten there he locates the Empire State Building Papa Elf has given him a snow globe encasing a miniature New York skyline and when he reaches the corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue he holds the globe aloft and compares its miniature scenery with the real-life edifice in front of him. Its a stunningly simple visual trick and a lovely one. And its just one more bit of proof that ""Elf"" is a movie made by people who really have their thinking caps on. As Newharts Papa Elf explains in the movies opening there are three main jobs for elves Making shoes in the middle of the night baking cookies inside a hollow tree and -- the most prestigious gig of all -- building toys in Santas workshop. But how many human beings among us are capable of making a comedy with wit and intelligence that also takes bold pleasure in unabashed silliness? I think this is what happens when you let an elf loose with a movie camera. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Starring Will Ferrell James Caan and Mary Steenburgen. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To look at any advertisement for ""Elf"" is to suspect what isnt true -- that the movie is one joke hammered into the ground that it exhausts itself after 15 minutes and then bludgeons the audience for an hour more before finally releasing into some canned ending with lots of false sentiment and jingling Christmas bells. There have been such movies. ""Elf"" isnt one of them. Instead ""Elf"" is funny and intelligently made a film for kids and adults thats both sweet and sardonic. It takes the clash between the world as we know it and the world as it exists in Christmas stories and exploits that contrast to expert comic effect. Then it does something even more difficult -- it comes in for a landing without banking too hard either in the direction of cynicism or sentiment. ""Elf"" stays perfectly in balance a pleasure throughout. Will Ferrell plays the dementedly cheerful Buddy a human being who through a mishap was brought up as an elf at Santas North Pole toy factory. The first minutes make good use of the sight gag of Buddy who is huge and has no idea he doesnt belong coping with tiny elf beds chairs and toilets. ""Elf"" is a comedy of incongruity but Buddys physical incongruity in elfland is nothing compared with the psychological incongruity of Buddy in New York City. Thats where screenwriter David Berenbaum and director Jon Favreau hit the comic mother lode. See Buddy finds out that he is not originally from the North Pole. Hes from New York and so he travels there looking for a father who doesnt know he exists. The casting of the father couldnt be more ideal -- James Caan whos not at all known as a comic actor and therefore not as cuddly as say fellow tough-guy Robert De Niro. He plays a grasping hard-nosed publishing executive and he seems like exactly that not an exaggerated version but the real thing. Its the key to the movie -- the way Favreau directs Caan. Favreau has the veteran actor play it straight and the result is that his sourness becomes a superb counterpoint to Ferrells good cheer. Ive been laughing for days at the way Caan as Buddys father prepares his wife (Mary Steenburgen) for her first meeting with Buddy. His face is a mask of weariness and disgust. He just cant believe what a terrible day hes having. He grumbles ""He thinks hes an elf."" Previous to this movie Favreau wrote the romantic comedy ""Swingers"" and wrote and directed the mob comedy ""Made."" ""Elf"" shows that he can make a film ostensibly outside his swinging urban milieu and from another writers script and yet still have it come out sounding like a Jon Favreau movie. Theres a satiric sensibility and an affection for extreme choices here that feel like a comedic signature When Buddy finds out that hes not an elf he runs stumbling and weeping through the snow like Jane Wyman in a 50s melodrama. Favreaus achievement should in no way take credit away from Berenbaum whose screenplay devises a series of irresistible situations. Just one example When Buddy finds out that ""Santa"" is coming to Gimbels he assumes it will be the real Santa (Edward Asner) not a helper. So the audience spends minutes looking forward to Buddys explosion when he finds out that the Gimbels Santa is an impostor. As Buddy Ferrell plays a happy idiot with heroic intensity and variety. Buddy is as uncontainable as a 6-year-old. Its a terrific comic performance completely invested physically energetic and utterly relentless.

Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG (some mild rude humor and language). At AMC Empire Loews Lincoln Square Kips Bay others. ---- ELF"" is a pleasantly old-fashioned gee-whillikers Yuletide confection rescued from Schmaltz-ville by the subversive comic talents of Will Ferrell. Its hard to imagine anyone but the former SNL-er inciting a laugh riot by bouncing about in yellow tights and pointy-toed slippers spouting forehead-slappers like ""Im a cotton-headed ninny-muggins"" and ""Smilings my favorite"" Shrewd direction by Jon Favreau (""Made"") and David Berenbaums smart colorful script lend a sly modernity to this delightfully fractured Christmas fairy tale - but its Ferrells show. The movie seems to deflate in the rare moments when his Buddy - an endearing childlike bundle of boundless enthusiasm - leaves the screen. When the orphaned Buddy was a baby he stowed away with Santa (Ed Asner) one Christmas Eve and ended up at the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (a wonderfully sardonic Bob Newhart). These early candy-colored scenes are delightfully old-school harking back to vintage TV Christmas specials such as ""Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" with Frosty the Snowman and a trio of stop-motion critters making cameos. Much hay is made from the visual incongruity of seeing Ferrells 6-foot-3 frame shoe-horned into Lilliputian situations until at the age of 30 he learns the shocking truth Theres a reason hes the only baritone in the elf choir. The news that he is really a human being and that his biological father is alive and living in Manhattan prompts a journey to that cynical metropolis where Buddys naive fish-out-of-water antics provide some of the films funniest moments. Ferrells genius at deadpan lunacy comes to the fore as Buddy encounters escalators and revolving doors for the first time merrily accepts fliers as if they were solid gold gifts from Tiffany and bursts into a diner to congratulate its owners on their claim to the worlds best cup of coffee. His father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) turns out to be a crusty workaholic publisher of childrens books with an office in the Empire State Building. Buddy is dismayed to discover his dads on Santas ""naughty list"" but thats nothing to Walters horror at learning he has a grown son who dresses like an elf and believes the four major food groups are candy candy canes candy corn and syrup. After a DNA test (conducted by Favreau making a brief appearance as a doctor) confirms his paternity Hobbs reluctantly brings Buddy home to stay with him and his neglected wife (Mary Steenburgen) and child (Daniel Tay). ""Elfs"" story line adheres to the feel-good holiday film formula - eventually the whole of New York is infected with Buddys euphoric Christmas spirit - and it hits some false notes along the way most notably Caans obvious discomfort in a role that requires him to engage in a tickle fight. But Ferrells manic overgrown-kid energy sweeps all before it announcing him - after his standout turn in ""Old School"" - as a major leading-man talent who can charm as well as amuse. Zooey Deschanel as Buddys gradually thawing love interest unveils a surprisingly smoky singing voice with a shower rendition of ""Baby Its Cold Outside"" and Peter Dinklage (""The Station Agent"") makes a memorable appearance as a supercilious kids book author.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 07 2003 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Mar. 23 2009 1158AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Elf Directed by Jon Favreau Written by David Berenbaum Starring Will Ferrell James Caan Zooey Deschanel Classification G Rating 1/2 Say hello kiddies to the first big-hearted flick of the season. Times up so say goodbye and be polite now try to hide your mild disappointment. Cause Elf is jolly but could have been jollier funny but could have been funnier charming but . . . well point made. The idea is a hoot. One fine Christmas Eve Santa slides down an orphanage chimney and while tending to the business of giving gets something in return Unbeknownst to him a toddler toddles into his Santa sack. Back up in the North Pole the discovery is made and the orphan is adopted by a merry band of elves -- all right with Bob Newhart as the elf-in-chief maybe less merry than sardonic. But good tiny folks nonetheless. They embrace ""Buddy"" even as he grows to his full Will Ferrell height -- a clumsy giant among the diminutive toy-makers. Cue the sight gags Brobdingnagian Buddy sitting on an elf toilet hitting his head on an elf rafter squeezing his bulk into an elf bunk. Were laughing but -- did I mention this? -- not quite often enough. A peek at the fellow behind the camera suggests why. Hes Jon Favreau who wrote Swingers and directed Made a proud resume in some ways but not this one It makes the guy a bad fit for wide-eyed cheer material. Penny Marshall he aint. At times even the elfin perspective gets screwed up. One moment relative to Buddy the tykes appear to be their miniature selves; the next not -- its like they just gorged on growth hormone. Happily Buddy quits the Pole to track down his long-lost Daddy in New York City where its not so cold and its Christmas-time too. And of course where a large man wearing a green frock coat and yellow tights can make himself right at home. Which Buddy does becoming what heroes always must in big-hearted flicks for the holiday season The innocent eye amid all the jaded cynics. Heading up the Scrooge camp is Daddy himself a workaholic whose Christmas-spirit meter isnt even registering. Maybe thats why James Caan looks startled in the role or perhaps hes just pondering the distance from Sonny Corleone to Papa Elf. Anyway when Big meets A Christmas Carol merriness ensues. Buddy is soon training the laser of his child-like goodness on all the mean Manhattanites and theyre falling for him fast. Better yet just wait for his de rigueur visit to the department-store toyland. Thats when he denounces a salaried Santa for a fake and when he does a little falling himself -- you guessed it for a lovely blonde earning a few bucks working on the elf squad (the always magnetic Zooey Deschanel who despite herself cant help but ooze sultriness even in cap and jingle bells -- maybe that Buddy isnt as naive as he lets on). This set-piece and others -- Buddy makes mayhem in Daddys mahogany office Buddy smothers his spaghetti in maple syrup and Smarties -- promise to be fun. And they are -- sort of. Ferrell promises to be a curly-haired goof you cant help but love. And he is -- rather. This movie promises to let you and the entire family rediscover your ""inner elf."" And it does -- more or less for a fat price plus the cost of popcorn and surely a drink and gee when all is said and counted up lets hope the kids arent too disappointed.

"From Will Ferrell a Ho-Ho-Hum Elf washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On From Will Ferrell a Ho-Ho-Hum Elf Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 7 2003 Forget your Billy Goats and your Bambino. For pure intense vivid and ruinous curses you have no further to turn than the redoubtable weekend fixture ""Saturday Night Live."" For nearly three decades it has quite routinely discovered attractive performers made them famous dispatched them to the movies and most often watched them fail miserably. That pattern is unlikely to be changed with the utterly misbegotten ""Elf"" which is the first and possibly the last Will Ferrell star vehicle. Its a clumsy tedious ride that wears out its welcome as it wears out the seat of your pants and the circulation in your lower limbs. And it employs exactly the same mechanism as the other ""SNL"" movie failures such as Chevy Chases Chris Kattans and Molly Shannons to name several of those who managed to make a few movies without killing themselves on drugs before their time in the limelight was up. The mechanism is as simple as it is ruthless ""SNL"" regularly finds brilliant sketch artists and nobody is funnier over the run of a seven-minute routine. But when you take that kind of incisive cartoony talent and attempt to spin it out over 90 minutes the results are painful to watch and harmful to listen to. ""Elf"" has the makings of a wonderful sketch. The irrepressible loose-limbed fearless and funny-looking Ferrell plays a man who as a baby crawled into Santas sack one night and was consequently taken to the North Pole where he was raised as an elf. Thus the movies first few jokes are by far its funniest playing on the tradition of visual surrealism the gangly Ferrell clearly an adult male festooned in green shorts and beanie trying to fit into a stylized North Pole world thats 36 inches too small for him. It helps too that this first best section is narrated by Buddys father-elf the self-effacing Bob Newhart who is still funny after all these years. Poor Buddy He cant join in any elf games because he keeps bumping his head on doorways or falling out of the tiny furniture. Hes clueless naive and lovable. But the movie goes seriously awry as it charts Buddys decision to join the real world find his real father and have a real life. And how does Buddy get to New York from the North Pole? Why he walks. They couldnt come up with anything better than that? That was old when ""The Beast From 20000 Fathoms"" did it back in 1953. The filmmaker sometime actor Jon Favreau can never figure out a way to reconcile the highly stylized North Pole settings with the more naturalistic New York. So he just doesnt bother and counts on his audience not to pay any attention to the jarring contrasts between them. Hes as unself-conscious as Buddy. In New York it soon turns out that poor Ferrell has but one joke and will play ever-more-desperate variations on it for most of the movies running time. Bereft of socialization he always takes at face value the more complex and frequently paradoxical cues of the civilized world thereby forever making hideous blunders. Because of his loony outfit Buddy attaches himself to a Gimbels toy department at Christmastime and when Santa is slated for an appearance he burbles ""I know him"" Worse when some poor schlub shows up in fake beard and red rent-a-costume he screams ""Thats not Santa"" A little of this doesnt go very far at all but the movie insists on showing us a lot of it. Some of the casting choices are quite peculiar as well. Who plays the real Santa? If I tell you Edward Asner youll probably think I made a mistake but that is indeed the growly grouchy brusque Lou Grant as the least appealing Santa on movie record. And who plays Buddys real father? If I say Sonny Corleone youll probably think Ive made another mistake but in fact thats the Dons oldest son as Dad with his feral eyes and his ultra-macho posture. James Caan you deserve so much more. You can surely intuit the emotional trajectory of ""Elf"" without actually bothering to see it. You know in advance that Buddys infectious Christmas innocence will enlighten and inspire the cynical tired real-world New Yorkers he finds himself among and that he will help them rediscover the spirit of the worlds most idealized holiday. And thats exactly how the movie is engineered to play. But what you wont have guessed is the ridiculous ending to the film which puts the Santa fantasy clumsily into the real world as Santas jet engine falls off and he ends up crash-landed in Central Park. Because the movie heretofore has had no villains Favreau working off a lame script from David Berenbaum hastily inserts them in the inappropriate form of a mounted squad of New York coppers who are presented more as saber-wielding Cossacks than as the citys finest public servants. Its a desperate ending to a desperate movie and so unfunny I forgot to laugh. But you can be thankful for small mercies At least ""Elf"" kept Ferrell from making a movie with Cheri Oteri about those loathsome cheerleaders Elf (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some less than tasteful humor.

"Will Ferrell under wraps in Elf. Slate Sign In Sign Up Will Ferrell under wraps in Elf. Will Ferrell under wraps in Elf. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 6 2003 354 PM Little Big Man Will Ferrell under wraps in Elf. By Michael Agger Not quite cowbell caliber but it works Watching Will Ferrell in the new comedy Elf (New Line) is a bit like waiting for a bomb to go off. The last time he appeared onscreen in Old School he spent most of his time going berserk. He became Frank the Tank a member of a ""civilian fraternity"" who downed funnels of beer led a solo streaking run and shot himself in the neck with a tranquilizer dart. All in all it was the Will Ferrell explosion that his fans had been waiting for. Ferrells comic genius is that he doesnt look like a maniac but knows how to act like one. Hes also capable of unshakeable deadpan. Ferrells most beloved sketch on Saturday Night Live (where he was a cast member from 1995 until last year) is a parody of VH1s Behind the Music in which he plays the cowbell as a member of the 70s intellectual rock band Blue Oyster Cult. He really really wants to tap the cowbell well and his fierce intensity cracks you up. His fellow cast-mate Jimmy Fallon covers his face with drumsticks to hide his laughter. At first glance Elf could easily be confused with an SNL skit with its simple set design and with Ferrell dressed in yellow tights black pointed shoes and a green frock coat. He plays Buddy an orphan who crawled into Santas sack as a baby and was raised by the elves. Buddy believes himself to be a genuine wee man despite the evidence that hes the Yao Ming of the North Pole and the only baritone in the elf choir. His surrogate elf father (Bob Newhart) tells Buddy the truth He does not suffer from a glandular condition and his real father a human works in the Empire State Building. Buddy treks through Canada and the Lincoln Tunnel to find him. During these early scenes Ferrell wears a creepy cheerful grimace. Tick. Tick. Tick. Only a matter of time before he wreaks elf havoc right? Advertisement Actually no. Ferrells elfness manifests itself not as arch comedy but as extreme enthusiasm. He smiles and tickles and sings. Hes a good argument for elf Ritalin. The only time he really cuts loose is during a New York montage that looks improvised Buddy waves back at people who are hailing cabs and gleefully takes advertising fliers from the stoic guys who hand them out. For the most part Ferrells trademark outbursts have been replaced by sugary sweet moments Buddy tries to fix Santas sleigh after it has crashed in Central Park; he admires his father (James Caan) even though Dad refuses to snuggle with him. The intensity that Ferrell usually invests in his comedy has been redirected toward holiday movie cliches but in a strange way it works He believes in the cliches and you believe in him. Elf is rigidly almost endearingly straight. The director Jon Favreau wrote and acted in Swingers (1996) and he seems a likely candidate for a hip subversive fable or else some of the cherubic anarchy that Richard Linklater served up in The School of Rock. But Favreau hasnt spiked the hot chocolate; hes made a heartwarming homage to Christmas movies past. The North Pole has a retro look Buddy ends up at Gimbels one of the department stores immortalized in Miracle on 34th Street (1947) and theres an animated snowman like the one in the classic Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer TV specials. The music is chirpy and borderline annoying. But once you rearrange your expectations and give yourself over to the movies unfailing earnestness you realize that Favreau and Ferrell do heartwarming fairly well. Its not spoiling anything to say that Buddy falls in love with a girl (Zooey Deschanel) reconciles with his dad and finds a way to save Christmas. The movie plucks all the old-fashioned notes with modest good-spirited vigor. Its irony-free fun for the whole family. Michael Agger is an editor at The New Yorker. Follow him on Twitter.

Director Jon Favreau. Area theaters (130). PG Mild rude humor and language. 3 STARS. Childlike wonder is what Will Ferrell does best and he has found the perfect outlet for it in the charming holiday movie ""Elf"" a non- sappy and genuinely adorable confection. It wiped away the Scrooge in me for 90 enchanting minutes. The wayward baby Buddy is raised at the North Pole by a gaggle of cheery industrious elves. Buddy may be ""a cotton-headed nanny-muggins"" at tasks requiring elf-like dexterity but hes just as enthusiastic about Christmas as the next fella in tights and green pointy hat. Even though he grows up to tower over everyone else on the toymaking assembly line - helped along by the movies clever use of forced perspective - Buddy hasnt a clue that hes adopted. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart deliciously deadpan as usual) gathers the big lug onto his tiny lap and breaks the news. Soon Buddy is off to New York City to seek out the biological father he never knew he had (and who likewise doesnt know that Buddy exists). As cotton-headed as the casting was for ""The Human Stain"" the casting here is just right. Tough guy James Caan looks honestly (and appropriately) embarrassed as an evil publisher who finds out this giddy man-child in green is his son. ""Lets snuggle"" says Buddy. Lets not says the look on Caans face. As youd expect Buddy worms his way into the hearts of some of the worst curmudgeons around ladling holiday cheer over jaded New Yorkers and finding apt employment as a department-store elf. (The movie sweetly re-creates the bygone Gimbels of Herald Square.) He also touches the heart of Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) a store clerk who is too stressed to let loose with her stirring singing voice. Among the many funny set pieces none of which overstay their welcome is one in which the 4-foot-6 actor Peter Dinklage (""The Station Agent"") plays a prickly childrens-book writer whom Buddy mistakes for an elf gone bad. One wonders if the script by David Berenbaum was inspired by the David Sedaris short story about his one-time employment as a Macys holiday elf. Sedaris sister Amy Sedaris has a small role here and the humor is much hipper and more sophisticated than youd expect from a comedy starring a ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus. Actor-turned-director Jon Favreau has a deft touch with his cast including Ed Asner as Santa and finds a way to get across the movies essential feel-good message without pouring syrup the way Buddy does on all his meals. There are also visual jokes that show someone was paying attention here. Those details pay off in a family movie that will jingle merrily at the box office.

Thats pretty much the running gag in ""Elf"" Jon (""Swingers"") Favreaus sweetly engaging comedy. As a human who was mistakenly raised by elves at Santa Clauss North Pole HQ Ferrell is the real draw. His charming goofiness -- lit up by that wild-eyed manic look -- makes the movie rather than the writing itself. Whats not to like? You laugh at Ferrells sight gags his seemingly impenetrable naivete and the fact that hes a 6-foot-plus man in a green costume all of which makes the movie more than pleasant enough for adults and children. But theres one teeny tiny problem Its only moderately funny. It could have been (and given Favreaus comic instincts should have been) a riot. But hey when an above-average PG-rated movie comes along -- in fact when any PG movie comes along -- you consider it manna from Santa. Its sleepy time for elf-raised human Buddy (Will Ferrell) who comes to New York City in search of his birth father (James Caan) in Jon Favreaus ""Elf.""

The old man (Edward Asner) and his legion of elves decide to keep him. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises him and Buddy as he comes to be called grows up as an elf. Clueless about his human identity Buddy assumes hes just a really really big elf who has to fold up like a concertina to fit in most of his living spaces. When Buddy learns of his human origins he makes the journey to Manhattan in search of his real father whose name is Walter Hobbs (James Caan). His old man it turns out has been on Santas naughty list for ages. Hes a shady type an insensitive childrens book publisher whos out of touch with wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter sure doesnt appreciate some overgrown nutball in tights and pointy shoes hugging him and insisting theyre father and son. A quick paternity test later Walter realizes Buddy is his son from an earlier liaison but that doesnt make matters any better. Although he begrudgingly lets Buddy move in theres hardly any love in the home. After (not surprisingly) getting a job in Gimbels Christmas department Buddy meets and soon falls for fellow employee Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) a withdrawn jaded young lady who has a terrific singing voice but doesnt dare sing out loud in public. His evolution into non-elfish humanity begins. Most of the movie is taken up with straight-ahead formula. Buddy gradually warms up his stepmother and half brother. Eventually of course he thaws his fathers heart. And theres more The spirit of Christmas is sadly flagging in New York City. Hes going to have to do something to put the cheer back in yuletide right around the time Santa comes through Manhattan to deliver this years round of gifts. But Ferrell provides just enough humor to get us through the familiar fare and enjoy the ride. For instance he has no idea what to do with an escalator. He insists that Walter tuck him in to bed at night. And when he sees a guy in Gimbels dressed as Santa Buddy (who knows the real Santa very well) assumes a terrible deception is taking place. ""Paul dont tell him what you want. Hes a liar"" Buddy tells the kid sitting on the false Santas lap. ""You sit on a throne of lies"" he screams at the shocked man in red. Its that childlike conviction in his eyes that makes this scene so funny and you look forward to the next off-the-wall reaction from this adorable big lug. ELF (PG 90 minutes) -- Contains mildly rude humor and language and a briefly sensual moment when Jovie is in the shower and Buddy hovers outside. Area theaters.

In one particularly puerile scene Elf star Will Ferrell emits possibly the longest burp ever recorded on film. Nothing evokes the holiday spirit quite so merrily as explosive gas. Will Ferrell tries to sleep with the little people in the new comedy Elf. By Alan Markfield New Line Productions In one particularly puerile scene Elf star Will Ferrell emits possibly the longest burp ever recorded on film. Nothing evokes the holiday spirit quite so merrily as explosive gas. But dont assume this silly comedy is a series of gross-out gags. The title character is actually a sweet lovable fella. Or at least he would be if he were about three decades younger. Its never explained why this adult man -- nicknamed Buddy -- looks to be about 35 or 40 but has the emotional maturity of a 4-year-old. At Buddys advanced age his childlike innocence is more creepy than cuddly. (Related video Watch a clip from Elf) More about the movie Elf   stars (out of four) Stars Will Ferrell James Caan Ed Asner Mary Steenburgen Director Jon Favreau Distributor New Line Cinema Rating PG for some mild rude humor and language One of his favorite pastimes is to curl up on the lap of his elf father (Bob Newhart). He also cant wait to hold hands and skip along with his human father (James Caan) or build gingerbread houses and decorate maniacally for the holidays. Buddy was raised by elves who are presided over by Santa Claus (Ed Asner). Once grown Buddy learns that he is a human which would explain him outgrowing elfin stature. Much is made of his inordinate size in the diminutive world of the North Pole and the sight of Ferrell attempting to squeeze his oversized body into a tiny desk chair as he recites the Elves Code is amusing. But the story is so derivative that a couple of moderately savvy middle-schoolers could have written it after a quick review of formulaic movies such as The Santa Clause or Jingle All the Way. Because this is a holiday movie it has to provide the requisite number of sentimental messages about the true meaning of Christmas. Elf satisfies the quota. When Buddy arrives in New York to find his birth fathers family his naivete initially befuddles but eventually charms everyone he meets. Could it be any other way? He wins over his dads kindly wife (Mary Steenburgen) and his lonely 10-year-old half-brother (Daniel Tay) who according to movie convention is being bullied by big kids and ignored by his workaholic dad. Buddy stumbles into a department store in his elf outfit and is mistaken for an employee. There he meets the disaffected Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) who loses all her cynicism under Buddys earnest influence. Its message is unobjectionable and there are a few laughs to be had but too much of Elf is like Buddys favorite meals syrupy sweet.

"Elf has the magic touch - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEWS Elf has the magic touchJon Favreaus hip film spreads cheer with gleeful innocence.November 07 2003|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer ""Elf"" is an example of the good things that can happen when hipsters do it on the square. The fable of what transpires when a young man raised by elves goes back to investigate his human roots it manages to be both genuinely sweet and just a teensy bit wised up.Directed by Jon Favreau from a script by David Berenbaum ""Elf"" returns to the hip but warm-hearted spirit of ""Swingers"" which Favreau both wrote and starred in. It brings sophisticated glee and a sense of innocent fun to what could have been a moribund traditional family film.Making this pay off without winking at the audience is a difficult task and ""Elf"" doesnt always feel all of a piece. But in ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus and star Will Ferrell the film has a guide who steers it unerringly over the bumpy patches.Ferrell is exactly right as Buddy who as an infant at an orphanage found his way into Santas bag and became the first human to penetrate into the fastness of his North Pole workshop. Adopted by Papa Elf (an amusingly dry Bob Newhart) Buddy grows up convinced hes an elf himself even though several factors point strongly in a different direction.For one thing Buddy lacking a true elfs nimble fingers might just be the worst toymaker in North Pole history a self-described ""cotton-headed ninny muggins."" Papa Elf takes pity on him and lets him work on Santas sleigh which runs on Christmas spirit thats measured by the uncannily accurate Clausometer.Then theres the matter of his size. At 6-foot-3 Buddy is bigger than your normal elf a whole lot bigger a size difference that director Favreau determined to keep things old school shows via the venerable technique of forced perspective rather than use modern computer generated imagery.There is one area however where Buddy is an elf all the way and that is in his bottomless good cheer. Despite having to wear the typical elf costume of bright green suit and conical hat over yellow tights and pointy shoes Buddy radiates cheer like its never been radiated before. Hes always ready with a hug even for angry raccoons and when he says ""I just like to smile smile is my favorite"" you know hes not just blowing smoke up Santas chimney.Since ""Elf"" is something of a one-joke movie its essential that Ferrell get this limitless innocence right -- and he does. His Buddy a cheerful combination of Stan Laurel and Tom Hanks in ""Big"" is an endearing elf Candide a true naif who cant help but make the best of everything.While this kind of attitude is fine for the North Pole where Edward Asners Santa is the only person allowed to get cranky the challenge for Buddy and this film is to make it creditable in ""a magical kingdom called New York City.""For once he finds hes a human and learns that his mother is dead thats where Buddy heads determined to find the father who doesnt know he exists. ""This is a golden opportunity"" Papa Elf tells him like he means it ""to find out who you really are.""Not for nothing however does Buddys father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) have a prominent place on Santas naughty list. The Simon Legree of the childrens publishing world hes too busy repossessing books from kindly nuns and shipping out stories without the final pages to pay attention to his wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) or his 10-year-old son Michael (Daniel Tay). Clearly a big dose of Christmas spirit is in order.Ditto for comely young Jovie (the always welcome Zooey Deschanel). Shes not a real elf but even though she plays one in Gimbels toy department she is a tad on the disaffected side and in need of the kind of infusion of good cheer only the genuine article can provide.Naturally New York being New York everyone is not happy with Buddys attitude which as ""Elf"" illustrates can be unexpectedly trying. A dwarf childrens book writer (""Station Agents"" Peter Dinklage) gets furious when Buddy mistakes him for an elf and a department store Santa goes ballistic when Buddy alive to the impersonation hisses at him ""you sit on a throne of lies.""""Elfs"" conscious employment of old-fashioned elements in the service of whimsical innocence extends to the use of the simplest kind of special effects to animate North Pole residents like a friendly Narwhale and Leon the Talking Snowman.That genial creature is voiced by Leon Redbone who collaborates with Deschanel on a sparkling duet of ""Baby Its Cold Outside"" that is the highlight of an eclectic soundtrack that includes Eartha Kitts ""Santa Baby"" Ray Charles ""Santa Claus Is Comin to Town"" and Wayne Newtons ""Jingle Bell Rock.""Even at a brisk 90 minutes ""Elfs"" single focus means it has to strain a bit to fill all its time but director Favreau so wants this to succeed and Ferrell plays Buddy with so much goofy conviction that everything turns out for the best. As Papa Elf reminds Buddy ""some people lose sight of whats important in life. All they need is a little Christmas spirit.""

Not to mention navigating midtown Manhattan without getting hit by a cab.An enjoyably goofy yuletide tale of a towering innocent with a serious sugar addiction (the four elf food groups candy candy cane candy corn and syrup) Elf follows the 6-foot-3-inch guy in yellow tights as he leaves Santas workshop at the North Pole to go looking for his biological father in New York - braving the Candy Cane Forest the Sugar Plum Valley and the Lincoln Tunnel to get there.Ferrell lips pursed and eyes popped wide plays the good-natured fool with good-natured charm - theres something inherently funny about the Saturday Night Live veteran and while his role here is a far cry from the party-animal antics of Old School the same talent for knuckleheaded slapstick shines through.The fumbling foundling (whose adoptive elf dad is portrayed by Bob Newhart) discovers his father presiding over a childrens book publishing house. Walter Hobbs (James Caan) is a workaholic editor whose company is in trouble and whose home life is an afterthought. And so while wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) is busy at her job the Hobbs young son (Daniel Tay the terrifically sulky kid version of Harvey Pekar in American Splendor) is pretty much left on his own. Until Buddy shows up that is. The newfound half-brothers bond in a hilarious Central Park snowball fight against a gang of delinquents.Zooey Deschanel who like Buddy is suited up in green and yellow - shes a department store elf - supplies the love interest. Buddy professes his amorous feelings for the pretty and pretty cynical New Yorker and the actress Jovie amused agrees to go out ""for food."" Like on a date.There is drama there is conflict and theres a calamitous meeting with a hotshot childrens author who happens to be a dwarf (Peter Dinklage star of one of this falls greatest pics The Station Agent). And there is Santa (a gruff but lovable Edward Asner) trying to get his rocket-and-reindeer-powered sleigh to work on Christmas Eve.Elf which nicely incorporates some animation in its North Pole sequences pays homage to a sack of Christmas movies from the department store Claus of Miracle on 34th Street to a standing-on-the-bridge-contemplating-suicide moment a la Its a Wonderful Life. And while the ending with a mob of New Yawkers breaking into a spirit-rousing carol is totally cornball its the kind of cornball - sugar-coated - that befits the season of tinsel-laden pointy green trees and movies like this one.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Elf  (out of four stars)Produced by Jon Berg Todd Komarnicki Shauna Robertson directed by Jon Favreau written by David Berenbaum photography by Greg Gardiner music by John Debney distributed by New Line Cinema.Running time 1 hour 30 mins.Buddy. . .

O. SCOTT Published November 7 2003 In Elf New York City -- and the rest of the world as well -- is suffering from a dearth of Christmas cheer. In the real world this seems to be a recurrent affliction and every November movies like this one which opens nationwide today are shipped to theaters as part of a nationwide studio-sponsored vaccination program. Some of them like Santa Clause 2 and How the Grinch Stole Christmas spread the very disease they are meant to cure clogging vulnerable immune systems with virulent sentimentality and turning perfectly decent mild-tempered folk (movie critics for instance) into Scrooges and Grinches. Directed by Jon Favreau (Made) a fine character actor who has also dabbled in screenwriting (Swingers) and chat shows (Dinner for Five on the Independent Film Channel) Elf is a charming silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it. The restraint comes from a jaunty witty script by David Berenbaum and also from the casting of two beloved old sitcom curmudgeons Ed Asner and Bob Newhart as Santa and his chief elf. The responsibility for overdoing it belongs to Will Ferrell the oafishly adroit shame-immune Saturday Night Live comedian who seems poised to enter the million-dollar pop-culture doofus pantheon alongside Adam Sandler Jim Carrey and SpongeBob SquarePants. This time out Mr. Ferrell admired for his television impersonation of George W. Bush plays Buddy the Elf who is not really an elf but an overgrown human child raised by elves. Buddy who towers over the other residents of the North Pole (thanks to some ingeniously designed sets and clever camera angles) is lovable but inept; he has been accepted by the elves and is doted on by his adoptive father (Mr. Newhart) but he still does not quite fit in. And so following the timeworn adoptee-in-search-of-birth-parent story line Buddy sets out for New York on a mission to find his roots and also to revive the faltering Christmas spirit of the notoriously cynical locals. Among the more cynical of whom is his own dad Walter Hobbs an overworked crabby childrens-book editor played by James Caan. Walter unaware of Buddys existence (blame the 60s) neglects his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and younger son (Daniel Tay). When a DNA test (administered by Mr. Favreau playing a doctor) establishes his paternity Walter has no choice but to take Buddy in and he is rapidly driven up the wall by his relentless manic sweetness. Buddys manner may have something to do with the quantities of candy cookies and other holiday goodies he consumes at every meal; the elf diet a reproof to the late Dr. Atkins consists almost entirely of the most suspect kinds of carbohydrates. Cutting through the sugar like a bracing dash of lemon juice is Zooey Deschanel playing Jovie an elf-for-hire at Gimbels where Buddy stumbles into a job. Ms. Deschanels extra-wide eyes and delicately pointy nose and chin give her face an elfin cast to begin with and she is as plausible a love interest as a character as fundamentally sexless as Buddy could hope to have. He cheers her up she calms him down and together they manage to be sincere cool and winningly goofy at the same time. The brisk bouncy comedy holds still for one splendidly romantic moment when Jovie and Buddy sing the teasing back-and-forth wintertime seduction song Baby Its Cold Outside. Mr. Favreaus direction has a relaxed swinging rhythm a reflection of the hipster nonchalance that has defined (and also limited) his acting style. The big chaotic scenes sometimes lack polish and precision but Elf also happily forgoes the slick hyperactive aggression that makes so many live-action holiday comedies so wearying. Elf is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a few mildly naughty jokes and innuendoes.

"Elfin magic - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Elfin magicWill Ferrell gets in touch with his comic inner ElfELF (star)(star)(star)November 07 2003|By Robert K. Elder Tribune staff reporter.Writer David Sedaris launched his career in 1992 with ""The SantaLand Diaries"" a scorching hilarious account of his brief career as a Macys Christmas elf. Given the reaction to that story still in regular holiday season rotation on public radio and sold in book form its astonishing that Hollywood didnt move faster on this fertile elfin ground.While ""Elf"" doesnt have Sedaris (his sister Amy has a small part however) it does have Saturday Night Live alum Will Ferrell in a role stitched into his DNA.Ferrell plays Buddy an orphaned human who was raised as an elf after he crawled into Santas (Edward Asner) bag one Christmas Eve. The dim Buddy doesnt figure out his heritage until his 30s at which time his adoptive elf father (Bob Newhart) tells him his biological father (James Caan) lives in New York City--and horror of all horrors--his name is on the naughty list With his work cut out for him Buddy rides an ice float to the Big Apple with plans for reunion.Ferrell with his frozen-on smile could be called the anti-Adam Sandler. Even in serious roles (""Punch-Drunk Love"") Sandler has embodied the angry stunted man-child whereas Ferrells stock-in-trade has been boyishly innocent male characters. Buddy with his bright doe-eyed disposition and cheerful outlook provides a home-run character for Ferrell who keeps us laughing even through some very obvious fish-out-of-water jokes.""Elf"" formulaic but lovable is essentially ""Big"" in pointy shoes. Instead of a toy store Buddy ends up working at Gimbels (possibly Sedaris account of Macys elf life was enough for Macys to stay out of the picture) where co-worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) captures his heart just before he gets fired.""You sit on the throne of lies"" Buddy tells one Gimbels store Santa sparking the false St. Nick to throttle him.Filmmaker Jon Favreau co-writer of ""Swingers"" and director of ""Made"" brings the North Pole to life with shiny happy elves in pointy hats and plate-sized snowflakes in a winter wonderland. Theres even a tip of the hat to the old Rankin/Bass cartoons with a computer-generated homage to Sam the Snowman (once voiced by Burl Ives) from the ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" series.Theres also a bit of brilliant typecasting in Newhart as Buddys buttoned-down Papa Elf. Nearly MIA since the 80s Newhart narrates an inspired opening; Papa Elf lays out exactly why elves and not gnomes or trolls cheerfully make toys in Santas sweatshop. Gnomes it seems love booze and trolls arent potty trained.Ferrell not the sharpest hat in the bunch cant grin himself through his outcast status being nearly twice the size of everyone else. The naive cherub apogee Buddy may be the key to rekindling Christmas spirit amongst humans most of whom dont believe in Santa any more. Even Santas sleigh which used to run on pure holiday spirit now relies on rocket technology.Nearly all Christmas stories end with the rejuvenation of holiday spirit. Heck even ""Gremlins"" follows that formula.So with Christmas movies its not the destination but the candy-colored journey. For his part Caan brings enough bah-humbug to counter Buddys sugar-fueled enthusiasm. Its smart of Favreau to allow the audience to identify with Caan an overworked book publisher who doesnt have time for his family. It makes his ultimate surrender and ours to Buddy just a bit sweeter.`Elf(star)(star)(star)Directed by Jon Favreau; written by David Berenbaum; photographed by Greg Gardiner; production design by Rusty Smith; edited by Dan Lebental; music by John Debney; produced by Jon Berg Todd Komarnicki and Shauna Weinberg.

Let it be said that I drew the line at Notting Hill a cloying piece of dreck in which that quintessential anonymous Everyman Hugh Grant got to shack up with Julia Roberts. Love Actually is rather lazily knocked off from Notting Hill though this time Grant plays the star a Blair-alike prime minister who falls for an ample foul-mouthed secretary (played with proletarian gumption by Martine McCutcheon) at Number 10. But it is far and away the more winning movie and it comes by its unrelenting schmaltz more or less honestly. If youre going to have your emotional responses shunted around like a gear stick it might as well be by someone who writes dialogue as funny as Curtis does and who in his first outing as a director brings Oxbridge panache and unquenchable sincerity to what is essentially a souped-up situation comedy. Slickly framed by the run-up to a London Christmas storyboarded within an inch of its life and snappily edited to rein in a plethora of subplots Love Actually reaches out to the hapless soul within all of us who cant connect or insists on loving the one we cant have or lusts after the hard-bodied secretary or lacks the courage to declare ourselves. Though the movie is billed as a vehicle for Grant in fact the actor only shows up every 20 minutes or so to do his usual embarrassed shuffle and stutter and run his fingers through his hair. (Why he keeps doing this tired shtick when given a bit of remorseless villainy to work with -- Restoration An Awfully Big Adventure -- the man can actually act is a mystery or would be if he didnt bring home the box-office bacon every time.) For the rest a vast ensemble of characters played by big-deal British stars sprinkled with talented character actors and a few Yanks for import-export purposes run around bumping into each other as they make the usual hashes of their love lives. The movie is littered with sensitive males among them Liam Neeson as an inconsolable widower trying to advise his lovelorn stepson; the infallible Alan Rickman as an excruciatingly ill-at-ease executive chafing under his comfortable marriage; and followers of Colin Firths torso will be ecstatic to hear that the dishy actor as a diffident mystery writer with a radar for the wrong woman once again dives shirtless into a pond. There are some ineffably funny moments most of them provided by Bill Nighy as a drug-addled aging rock star trying to make a comeback with the gooey 60s hit ""Love Is All Around"" and Curtis longtime collaborator Rowan Atkinson as a department-store salesman with an irregular attitude toward gift-wrap. Still for a romantic comedy Love Actually is a pretty good anatomy of loneliness and grief whether its that of Emma Thompson striving in vain for dowdiness as Rickmans stay-at-home wife whos trying to cope with the fact that her clueless husband has just bought his nubile secretary a pricey necklace or of Laura Linney as a tweedy office employee pining for a handsome colleague even as she fields impossible family commitments. True the director makes sure in almost every case that everything comes up roses. Movies like Love Actually are often made by jaded cynics preying on our shallowest feelings. One senses that Curtis is not a cynic but a congenital optimist who believes that notwithstanding the evening news love really is all around -- or at least lurking by the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport. Love Actually is often banal but it is not false and even its willfully sunny creator will allow that love doesnt conquer all. The truest most affecting scenes come late in the movie and they have nothing to do with resolution and everything to do with renunciation.

Sep. 13 600pm In Elf a tale of the triumph of insane goodness over negligible evil Will Ferrell plays an oversize elf looking for his long-lost papa in the fleshpots of Manhattan. So pure of heart is Buddy that there are moments when you want to kill him but on the whole hes an affable if strangely dressed fellow whose mission did he but know it is to restore the spirit of Christmas to the heedless hellhole that is New York City. This rather goes against the Zeitgeist which since September 11 has retooled Manhattan into a paragon of fortitude and fraternal solidarity. Still why quibble with the adjusted reality of Parental Guidance -- which requires a clear division between good and evil -- especially when it comes in a package as charmingly irreverent as Elf? Our story begins in a spiffed-up North Pole where an orphaned baby is being raised by a laconic Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) with occasional assistance from a gruff Santa (Ed Asner). When Buddy grows into a 6-foot-3-inch giant too clumsy for the toy-making detail Papa Elf must explain to the boy that he is in fact a human. Eager to find his place in the world the lad treks blithely across cartoon America on foot to seek out the deadbeat dad who abandoned his mother before he was born. In New York it seems that Buddy has exchanged one outsider status for another The Big Apple turns out to be full of worms not the least of which is Buddys father Walter (James Caan straight of face) a childrens-book publisher much given to cutting corners in the service of the bottom line. Once convinced that Buddy is not a singing telegram Walter still wont give him the time of day even though his wife (Mary Steenburgen the worlds most childlike actress over 50) embraces the erstwhile elf as part of the family. No prizes for guessing whos the real prodigal son in this family. At first blush Elf may seem a stretch for director Jon Favreau but in fact it is all of a piece with Made and Swingers both of which are about overgrown kids adrift in big cities. If anything the movie is a departure for distributor New Line whose 2003 releases boast the shock doc The Real Cancun and the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Elf is not just a kids story but a Disney-perfect one to boot in which truth and innocence bring balm to a dysfunctional family and a city full of raging capitalists. But the movie allows Favreau to gently tweak cutesy Mouse House production values without abandoning the concept and it proves a splendid sandbox for his talents as director actor and (who knew?) cartoonist. The most endearing and visually inventive set pieces in Elf play out in a toy store and in Walters mailroom where Buddy brings joy to the world by creating a winter wonderland wherever he goes. For his part Ferrell doesnt do much other than prance about being good-natured and though the actor is somewhat glassy-eyed as if longing to be off somewhere doing impressions in his statutory green-and-yellow costume topping enormous curly slippers he looks adorably like a giant zucchini with its roots still on. And though Elf deserves a good hiding for criminally underutilizing the divine comedy of Zooey Deschanel who plays Buddys love interest (and unexpectedly sings like a nightingale) I cannot find it in my heart to spank a movie that boasts Bob Newhart in chrome-yellow tights bifocals and the same empty stare that made him the worlds goofiest television therapist.

"Elf | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; elf ) Elf (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Elf is being hailed in some quarters as the next great Christmas classic. The people making such a pronouncement must have seen a different cut of the movie than the one shown to me. Elf is a feather-light motion picture that embraces the Christmas spirit but in the process forgets that its trying to be a comedy. Maybe the problem is that Will Ferrell as outrageous a comedian as there is is neutered beyond his ability to be funny by the family friendly PG rating. Or maybe its that the screenplay is pitched at a third grade level. Regardless Elf is more likely to end up on the snow pile of forgettable Christmas-themed movies than in the vault of memorable ones. Theres a difference between family movies and kids movies. Titles in the former category are typically well-rounded motion pictures that offer genuine entertainment value to viewers of all ages. Films in the latter group will entertain those whose age remains in the single digits while hopefully not making their parents wish they were somewhere else. Elf wants to be thought of as a family film but the reality is that its a kids picture. The best age for viewers of Elf is about seven or eight. A lack of sophistication is important as is a naivetA(c) about story construction. Theres barely enough here to keep an adult engaged but children (especially those who celebrate Christmas) will inhale what the movie has to offer. The premise is simple enough and sounds like a decent basis for a Christmas carol. Buddy (Ferrell) is about twice the size of every other elf on Santas staff. Thats because hes not really an elf. Hes a human orphan who was adopted by the Fat Man (Edward Asner) 30 years ago. Only now has his step-father (Bob Newhart) gotten around to telling him the truth. Armed with a picture of his biological dad (James Caan) Buddy heads to New York City. There he discovers an unfamiliar culture a man who doesnt want to acknowledge his existence and a cute girl named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) who captures his heart. Then when something goes amiss on Christmas Eve he gets an opportunity to rescue Santa and save the holiday. Ferrell has a few signature moments but the screenplay was not written to his strengths. (As boorish as it is a film that fills that role is Old School.) He is strangely muted and for the most part not especially funny. The movie offers some chuckles but very few moments that will shake the belly like a bowl full of jelly. The best scene (at least from a comedy perspective) only peripherally features Ferrell. That star of that sequence is a dwarf who happens to be the most popular writer of childrens books. Theres an edge to that part of the movie that is sadly missing from the rest of it. The film opens with promise. Bob Newharts deadpan narration is amusing and its an unexpected surprise to see a few animated creatures inspired by the cheesy-but-beloved Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials (""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" etc.). After the action moves to New York however moments of inspiration become scarce. We get a lot of recycled ""fish out of water"" jokes that would have been at home in Crocodile Dundee or Blast from the Past. James Caan gets to play a version of Scrooge. And the luminous (but underused) Zooey Deschanel provides a romantic interest. Things really start to fall apart when Santa is threatened by a group of marauders in Central Park. The films director is Jon Favreau one of the original Swingers. This is his second outing behind the camera following the limp Made. However where that movie earned a deserved R from the MPAA here Favreau is trying to make something of a kinder gentler persuasion. To the extent that its kid-friendly he has succeeded. But the movies appeal is limited and in the end just about the only thing Elf has going for it is the time of year when its being released. For those who are desperate to take their kids to a holiday-themed flick pickings are slim and thats probably the only reason Elf wont sink like a rock at the box office.

Sweet-natured outsider fantasy neither skimps on nor overplays its sentimentality which should make it a major family audience draw through the holidays. Will Ferrell graduates to his first solo leading role with flying colors in ""Elf"" a disarming holiday comedy about a clueless innocent who saves Christmas and fosters a renewed sense of family in his reluctant father. Recalling seasonal comedies like ""The Santa Clause"" and the child-as-adult humor of ""Big"" the film feels slightly stitched together rather than having the assured classical storybook flow of say ""Shrek."" But the sweet-natured outsider fantasy neither skimps on nor overplays its sentimentality which should make it a major family audience draw for New Line through the holidays. While the Nov. 7 release date seems marginally early for the Christmas market the same timeslot has been successfully mined in years past by ""The Santa Clause"" and ""The Santa Clause 2"" which respectively grossed 144 million and 139 million on domestic release. Grouped with ""Freaky Friday"" and ""School of Rock"" ""Elf"" represents another solid entry in a better-than-average season for studio family comedies. And while it seems unlikely to transcend age barriers to the extent of the Jack Black vehicle this second outing as director for actor Jon Favreau has a hint of adult edge thanks to Ferrells spirited mix of absurdity naivete and physicality plus enough agreeably off-color humor to counter its cuteness. Recounted in fairy-tale style the story concerns an orphanage baby who crawls inside Santas gift sack while the bearded rotund one (Edward Asner) inhales cookies. Inadvertently transported back to the North Pole and raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) young Buddy (Ferrell) -- named for his diaper brand -- fast outgrows his fellow elves in the toy workshop and soon towers over his adoptive dad. To make things even more awkward Buddy is all thumbs when building toys and cant keep up the production pace. Realizing hell never fit in he leaves the nest for New York City to find his real family. The film achieves much of its buoyancy from Ferrells exuberant physical comedy and the characters immensely likeable guilelessness. The actors rangy 6 foot-plus frame is wedged in ungainly fashion into the dinky North Pole structures -- squatting in an elf-friendly bathroom or even leaping onto disconcerted Papa Elfs diminutive lap for comforting. While its mercifully distant from the saccharine whimsy of films like ""Toys"" theres a certain kiddy preciousness to the early action in an artificial environment replete with CGI snow creatures and candy cane fields but this dissolves fast when Buddy hits Manhattan. Ferrell gets considerable mileage from the comic opportunities of an oafish full-grown man dressed in an elf suit and yellow tights raised in Toyland and experiencing the big city for the first time. He earns steady laughs delightedly eating discarded gum spinning in revolving doors hopping over pedestrian crossings warily negotiating an escalator and effusively greeting hard-nosed New Yorkers. Buddys encounter with his father Walter (James Caan) proves difficult. A cynical childrens book publisher with little time for his wife (Mary Steenburgen) or son Michael (Daniel Tay) Walter has even less patience with the crazed intruder claiming to be a son he never knew from a relationship with a now-deceased college sweetheart. Tossed out of Walters Empire State building offices by security Buddy dutifully obeys the instruction to try Gimbels ending up on staff in the department stores Christmas merchandise area. But while he develops an awkward bond with Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) a seemingly jaded holiday staffer with a warm heart and an elf costume and gives the lackluster North Pole display a dazzling makeover Buddy gets fired for noisily disputing the authenticity of the store Santa. However he manages to find a way into his fathers family forming an alliance both with Walters warm-natured wife and with his own paternally neglected half-brother Michael. David Berenbaums screenplay is by no means low on wit. But it travels in somewhat lurching mode between the fantasy North Pole opening and the more realist New York environments switching back to a realm of the imagination with a cornball flavor in the final stretch when Santa returns to Gotham on Christmas Eve. Like many actor-directors Favreau thinks less in visual terms than in the service of storytelling and performance. However he milks the constant stream of sight gags for maximum effect aided immeasurably by Ferrells relentlessly cheerful open-hearted endearingly awkward performance. Caan also scores as Buddys inevitably slow-softening father and Deschanel is once again a charmingly offbeat this time almost literally elfin presence though shes somewhat under-used. Newhart and Asner both inject a sweeter side into their familiar personae respectively dry and gruff. Perhaps the best of the supporting turns is Peter Dinklage playing a surly opposite of his character in ""The Station Agent"" -- a celebrated childrens book author who happens to be a dwarf. He reacts violently when Buddy tries to embrace him as a fellow elf in a hilarious scene that goes refreshingly against the usual p.c. caution. Favreau shows up briefly on-camera as a doctor. Effects work is polished meshing well with the pics spruced up seasonal look. Soundtrack is littered with Christmas standards including some tunefully sung by Deschanel.
