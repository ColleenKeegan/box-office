Blatant `Instinct` - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Blatant `Instinct`Thriller Crosses The Line Into ExploitationMarch 20 1992|By Dave Kehr.Launched last year by ``The Silence of the Lambs`` Hollywood`s fascination with the serial killer as superstar continues with ``Basic Instinct`` a cold repellent commercially potent thriller that cleverly never quite decides whether to fear or admire its central character.Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is a glacially blond San Francisco heiress who has turned her fabulous wealth and formidable intelligence to the pursuit of sexual adventure a pursuit that may or may not include driving ice picks through the chests of her lovers at the moment of climax.She at least is the leading suspect in the slaying of a retired rock star an extremely grisly event that director Paul Verhoeven (``RoboCop````Total Recall``) has offered for the audience`s delectation in the film`s opening sequence. Called in on the case is homicide Detective Nick Curran(Michael Douglas) an ace investigator whose calm demeanor hides a deeply troubled soul.For Nick a term as an undercover narcotics investigator ended when in a cocaine haze he accidentally shot a pair of tourists. Remanded to the care of a police department psychiatrist the alluring Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn) with whom he is having an exceedingly unethical affair he is struggling to put his life together again-to stop smoking stop drinking and stop feeling the attraction to the dark side.Catherine a brilliant psychology student and an accomplished manipulator immediately recognizes Nick`s weaknesses and begins to exploit them flirting with him outrageously during her formal questioning (Catherine is not a believer in undergarments nor Verhoeven in subtlety).It even appears that Catherine has selected Nick deliberately in order to use him as the subject of a novel she is writing-about a cop who falls in love with a woman he is investigating and is destroyed by her.Catherine is a fairly classical femme fatale not so much different from the man-eating model perfected by Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg`s``Blue Angel`` but with the important distinction that the hints of sadomasochism bisexuality and nymphomania latent in Dietrich`s character have now become blatant.Catherine even has a live-in female lover Roxy (Leilani Sarelle) whom she invites to observe the lovemaking sessions that soon begin with Nick.(The homophobic implication that Roxy might be the killer motivated by jealousy over Catherine has angered some gay rights groups.)Like Hannibal Lecter in ``The Silence of the Lambs`` Catherine is portrayed as a kind of superbeing whose superior intelligence andseductiveness become a license to break conventional moral bounds-to devour the lesser creatures of the planet either sexually or in Lecter`s case literally.For Verhoeven who explored very similar themes in his 1984 art-house hit ``The Fourth Man`` made in his native Holland the fascination with sexual power extends also to the relationship between filmmaker and spectator.Catherine works on Nick just as Verhoeven works on his viewer appealing to those ``basic instincts`` with promises of forbidden delights and dark pleasures. Using blasting music (by Jerry Goldsmith) a prowling camera(guided by cinematographer Jan De Bont) and slyly manipulative editing patterns that constantly cheat on questions of point of view Verhoeven constructs an overpowering machine-an assault on the senses that leaves the spectator cowed beaten. It`s the worst kind of abuse of the medium`s immense inherent power.Where is the pleasure for the ticket-buyer in this kind of brutal and brutalizing experience? One wonders if the psychology isn`t so much different from that of the abused child who becomes a child abuser. One could identify with Catherine who is by far the film`s strongest most attractive character. The viewer is able to recover the sense of power the film has stripped away-to identify with the oppressor and share the thrill of domination.Movies of course should not be confused with literal acts of violence and it is even possible that violent films help to defuse this kind of anger and fear by playing out these common inescapable feelings as games and fantasies.But every time a movie descends to this sort of cruel primitive appeal it further weakens the bond of trust and responsibility that must lie between a work of art and its audience leaving both artist and spectator cheapened by the experience.It is not difficult to make an impact on this level; push the buttons and the audience will respond. What is difficult is to make sense of the destructive impulse to understand its causes and consequences as filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang struggled to do. Verhoeven does not explore the dark side but merely exploits it and that makes all the difference in the world.``Basic Instinct``(STAR)Directed by Paul Verhoeven; written by Joe Eszterhas; photographed by Jan De Bont; production designed by Terence Marsh; edited by Frank J.

Directed by Paul Verhoeven from a script by Joe Eszterhas. Alderwood Cinerama Crossroads John Danz Kent Northgate Seatac Mall Southcenter. ""R"" - Restricted due to language violence graphic sex scenes. --------------------------------------------------------------- Slick clever and entertainingly overheated while youre watching it ""Basic Instinct"" starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater. Like most of the movies written by Joe Eszterhas during the past decade its a skin-deep thriller that draws its suspense from one question Does the central characters chosen object of lust and/or affection deserve to be trusted? In Eszterhass ""Jagged Edge"" Glenn Close fell in love with a man accused of murdering his wife. In ""Betrayed"" Debra Winger was infatuated with a neo-Nazi. In ""Music Box"" Jessica Lange refused to believe her father was a war criminal. ""Jagged Edge"" came first and still seems the most compelling of the lot perhaps because the formula wasnt so obvious seven years ago. Yet Eszterhas screen-writing fee keeps going up. He got 3 million for this one - which is still a fraction of the 14 million that the movies sole marquee name Michael Douglas took home. For all that money Eszterhas does offer a twist on his formula. This time the man is the one who must do the trusting while the woman is immediately suspect. In the opening scene a retired rock star is graphically murdered at the moment of sexual climax by a woman whose face we cant see. Is the killer his super-bright very rich girlfriend (Sharon Stone) who shows no remorse and shamelessly flirts with the San Francisco police detective (Douglas) who questions her? Or is it the girlfriends girlfriend (Leilani Sarelle) who is intensely jealous of this flirtatious new relationship? Or is there another culprit? The fact that the chief suspects are lesbians or bisexual women has drawn fire from gay groups who have called the script ""gratuitously defamatory"" toward lesbians and women in general. The same charge could be made against any number of film-noir classics that prominently feature predatory femmes fatale of ambiguous sexuality. Whats objectionable about ""Basic Instinct"" is not the fact that the killer may be a woman who sometimes sleeps with women but that Eszterhas and the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven use her bisexuality as decadent kinky window dressing. When major studios adapt novels about positive lesbian role models such as ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and ""The Color Purple"" the lesbianism is invariably removed. (A protest group plans to distribute flyers wave signs and perform street theater at 615 tonight at the Cinerama Theater.) The heterosexual lovemaking scenes which were snipped here and there to purchase an R rating benefit from Jerry Goldsmiths sensual score and Jan De Bonts stylish wide-screen cinematography. But too many of them seem familiar. Didnt we recently catch Douglas doing this up-against-the-wall cant-stop-now routine with Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction""? Eszterhas does have a knack for introducing complications subplots and additional suspects just in time to keep you from paying attention to plot holes. Verhoeven keeps you watching and handles his actors well although his best-known European film ""The Fourth Man"" which also deals with gay characters and a woman whose lovers kept dying on her was executed with far more wit and sophistication. Hes slumming here. Douglas is always believable as the half-rotten hero Jeanne Tripplehorn is a real find as his ex-lover and Stone (who played Arnold Schwarzeneggers devious wife in Verhoevens ""Total Recall"") comes through with the kind of dazzling icy/hot performance that made a star of Kathleen Turner in ""Body Heat."" When the controversy has been forgotten ""Basic Instinct"" may be remembered as the movie that put her on the map. Copyright (c) 1992 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Basic Instinct Is Tantalizing Thriller - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sharon Stone Basic Instinct Is Tantalizing ThrillerBasic Instinct - 1210 a.m. Tuesday (68433871) - ShowtimeAugust 14 1994|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticBasic Instinct is a little like a vampire movie in which all the vampires are gay or bisexual.This is not of course fair to gays bisexuals or I suppose vampires.But bad politics sometimes makes for good movies and the harsh politically incorrect truth about Basic Instinct is that its a tantalizing suspensefully correct thriller.Michael Douglas the hero of the piece is back on the streets of San Francisco as police detective Nick Curran. He and his partner are called in to investigate the murder of a former rock star a man who was repeatedly stabbed with an ice pick while having sex.What makes this case especially intriguing for Nick is that the dead mans girlfriend - a rich coldly luscious writer named Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) - had previously published a novel in which a woman kills an ex-rock star in exactly the same way right down to the detail of her tying his hands with a silk scarf before reaching for the murder weapon.For Nick the question is Do the facts mean that Catherine had been planning the murder for some time or do they let her off the hook because she couldnt possibly be stupid enough to murder someone by a method that she had detailed in writing?The case interests Nick for other reasons too not the least of which is the brutality of the murder which appeals to his own violent streak.Nick is also fascinated by the sheer sexiness of Catherine who is obviously coming on to him. Hes irresistibly drawn to this woman who at times seems like a bisexual version of the Kathleen Turner character in Body Heat.Sex has a kinky glamour here as does death - a glamour that extends to the movies stars. And director Paul Verhoeven uses Douglas and Stone very cleverly.Douglas plays a man in decline which is his forte. Theres something in those big eyes of his that seems to cry Help Im fallingAs for Stone Verhoeven gets a multilayered performance from her that holds us at emotional arms length. Her body stands fully revealed but her psyche is left to the imagination.

"MOVIE REVIEWS  Blood and Lust - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS  Blood and LustMarch 20 1992|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""Basic Instinct"" is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion between tension and hysteria between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans. And ""Basic Instinct"" is not a great thriller.Directed by Paul Verhoeven from a Joe Eszterhas script and starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone ""Basic Instinct"" (citywide) has not exactly crept into town on little cats feet. This story of a tough cop falling for a sultry murder suspect has been the center of an interminable string of controversies ranging from the fury the project aroused among gay rights activists while it was being shot in San Francisco to the changes Verhoeven had to make in his cut to avoid the dread NC-17 and get a more inclusive R rating (for strong violence sensuality drug use and language).But even though bisexual and lesbian characters do appear only in non-role-model roles ""Basic Instinct"" feels more contemptuous of women in general than specifically anti-gay. And despite liberal amounts of both male and female nudity the celebrated sex scenes have all the feeling and finesse of aggressive board checking in the Stanley Cup finals.More than a lack of sensibility ""Basic Instinct"" suffers from a lack of sense. A certain number of red herrings go with the genre but Eszterhas celebrated 3-million script about blood and lust is so riddled with implausibilities not to mention impossibilities that its denouement cant stand up to the most minimal scrutiny.Scrutiny however is something this particular director does not encourage. Because right from the opening sequence Verhoeven batters the audience with such insistent bravado that youre too busy checking for broken bones to spend much time worrying about what is going wrong.The credits are barely over before Jan De Bonts opulent camera work is zeroing in on a couple making wild and passionate love. The woman is blond her face conveniently hidden (the only part of her anatomy that is) by her tousled hair. Deftly she reaches under a pillow pulls out a white silk Hermes scarf and ties her all-too-willing partners hands to the bedpost. A few moments later however she puts a firm end to his fun by producing an ice pick and filling the poor man full of holes.Assigned to investigate the victim being an ex-rock star and a good friend of the mayor are the requisite odd couple cops slick and handsome detective Nick Curran (Douglas) and his overweight salt-of-the-earth partner Gus Moran (George Dzundza). After a detour with a sultry lesbian named Roxy (Leilani Sarelle) the pair head out to Marin County and the spectacular home of the dead mans girlfriend Catherine Tramell.Played with snooty insouciance by Sharon Stone Catherine is ""Basic Instincts"" most original character if not exactly its most believable. Beautiful seriously uninhibited with the looks of a Grace Kelly ice princess and the wicked blistering tongue of Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS Catherine intimidates men without half trying. Worth 100 million in inherited money she is also an author whose latest novel concerns guess what a retired rock star murdered by his girlfriend.Did Catherine do the deed writing the book as the perfect alibi? Or is she being framed by a devious and despicable copycat murderer who knows just how to make her look guilty guilty guilty? Either way intones a somber police expert ""youre dealing with someone very dangerous and very ill.""Naturally all this intrigues our friend Nick to no end. Moreover it turns out that he and Catherine have the kind of psychic bond that enables them to almost read each others thoughts. As Nick gets deeper into the investigation more about Catherines past is revealed and more about his as well such as the reasons hes had to seek the services professional and otherwise of comely police psychologist Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn).As a beginning this is certainly more promising than the recent spate of puny Hitchcock knockoffs like ""Final Analysis"" and ""Under Suspicion."" Yet like the sex between Nick and Catherine inevitable from the moment they lay panting eyes on each other but disappointing (for the audience at least) once it arrives ""Basic Instinct"" does not turn out well in the end.One reason is that its uniformly unsavory characters having been established in a state of near-frenzy have the tedious task of maintaining that extreme position for the films entire length. Though Stones ultimate tease act is at first intriguing its lack of variety soon wears out its welcome. The same is true for Douglas Nick who spends so much time drenched in anger and frustration that one begins to fear that his ever-tightening neck muscles will explode under the strain.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLovelace Sharon Stone really disappears into a roleAugust 7 2013Feminism after the factMarch 26 2006Basics Instinct  B.U.M.

I dont care how many firmly toned tummies and tushes are bared.Nor does it make a difference that two of the bods belong to Michael Douglas (as a killer cop) and Sharon Stone (as the suspected ice-pick murderess) whose flesh looks airbrushed with that bronzer you see slathered on centerfolds.Basic Instinct quickly announces itself as a 90s-style experiment in psycho-terror. Every sexual coupling is accompanied by the threat of violence or pain. Much of the San Francisco action takes place in fabulously appointed Nob Hill mansions and beachfront estates that glow in the Pacific twilight. (Even the detectives apartment has a breathtaking view of the TransAmerica pyramid.) Everyone wears designer duds including a police psychiatrist whose miniskirts are more provocative than Barbra Streisands in The Prince of Tides.To heighten the plausibility factor in this movie populated with killer cops and cop killers everyone leaves his/her front door unlocked.The only way you can tell the difference between the psycho criminals and the wacko crime-solvers is that at least the psychos know theyre sick.Basic Instincts basic premise is that heiress-mystery writer Catherine Tramell (Stone) is a prime suspect in a sex murder exactly like one described in her latest paperback bestseller. When Detective Nick Curran (Douglas) picks her up for questioning he is aroused by this blond ice - or is it ice pick? - queen who talks so profanely about hot sex.Further Catherine knows secrets about Nick that the disturbed cop has never shared. Not even with his estranged girlfriend Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorne) a police psychiatrist assigned to help him. When Catherine throatily discloses that her latest novel is based on Nick - its about a trigger-happy San Francisco cop who falls in love with the wrong woman and gets killed - the cop and suspect begin a game of psych-out that inevitably leads to the sack.Since the plots of Catherines murder mysteries have a way of being acted out in real life Nick and his colleagues are stumped. Are the books a way for Catherine to premeditate and rehearse her crimes? Or is someone trying to frame the tawny blonde who never wears underwear beneath her creamy silk dresses?Omnisexually voracious Catherine likes to provoke her lovers so there are a tantalizing number of suspects with motive. One is Roxy (Leilani Sarelle) her jealous lesbian girlfriend. Another is Hazel (Dorothy Malone) a paroled mass murderess who Catherine claims is a ""source"" for her books. Add to these Nick who enjoys competing with Roxy for some sheet time with Catherine.Those concerned about the movies purported negative stereotyping of lesbian and bisexual women should know that Basic Instinct isnt homophobic. It is misanthropic. Crossing preference lines the film ascribes hateful characteristics to everyone male and female hetero- and homosexual. Its not a simple question of whether the hero is straight and the villain is gay In this movie everyone psychologically speaking is crooked.Because for filmgoers all movies cost 6 I normally dont mention the price tag of a screenplay or production. But considering that scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas received 3 million for this murder mystery thats confounding as to whodunit you figure hes made the real killing.Eszterhas who here plagiarized his own screenplays for Jagged Edge (which I very much enjoyed) and Music Box never before has written a thriller this preposterous. Basic Instincts characters lack psychology and therefore motive. Admittedly they possess pathology but thats not enough to maintain suspense in a movie with plot holes big enough to drive a tank through.The PQ - preposterous quotient - is further upped by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who was much more assured with the special effects of RoboCop and Total Recall than he is dealing with actors here. Although he was great with the performances in Spetters and The Fourth Man the dialogue in Basic Instinct is hastily emoted with such overemphasis - ""Youre dealing with a devious mind"" the shrink shrieks to Nick - that it recalls a Grade-Z horror flick. This cost 49 million?Now about those ice picks. A rather archaic bar tool to be so commonplace in these high-tech kitchens no? Given the upscale suspects in this film where even the cops wear Armani isnt it odd that not one character possesses a freezer with an automatic ice maker or cube tray?BASIC INSTINCT  Produced by Alan Marshall directed by Paul Verhoeven written by Joe Eszterhas photography by Jan De Bont music by Jerry Goldsmith distributed by TriStar.Running time 2 hours 2 mins.Det.

In an elegantly spacious bedroom a couple is having nasty frenzied sex (the only kind anyone has in this movie). We cant see their faces too well but thats okay; their bodies will do. The woman a curvy blond with silky-smooth tan skin (the only kind anyone has in this movie) begins straddling the man. He reaches back and grabs the bars on the headboard Samp;M-style and she binds his hands. There is much groaning and writhing. Then just as her forceful gyrations bring him to a loud sweaty soul-wrenching climax (the only kind anyone has in this movie) she produces an ice pick and plunges it into his upper body over and over sending bright gobs of blood spurting everywhere. Ah sweet mysteries of love This high-powered meat tenderizer of an opening cant help but dovetail with the welter of controversy and publicity -- at this point is there really any difference? -- that has swirled around Basic Instinct ever since it was shot in San Francisco last spring. This you may recall is the movie that aroused the ire of gay groups that seemed destined for an NC-17 rating (though of course it was trimmed to get a more commercially desirable R) that had a script by Joe Eszterhas (Jagged Edge Flashdance) that fetched a record 3 million. With that sort of buildup the film sounded like a sheer sensationalistic blowout a Pandoras box of smashed taboos -- the sort of thing you want to see precisely because it promises one lurid quasi-pornographic cheap thrill after another. Well folks you can loosen your seat belts. Basic Instinct which stars Michael Douglas as a jaded cop and Sharon Stone as a bisexual ice princess who becomes the prime suspect in a murder case has just enough sleaze and drive to keep you watching. Visually its edgy and impressive -- it has the glowing molten orange moodiness of an elegant hotel lobby -- and it works hard to tap into the dark seductive space where hot sex meets cold dread. Beneath its heavy-breathing fripperies though the movie is mechanical and routine a muddle of Hitchcockian red herrings and standard cop-thriller ballistics. There are four unusually lengthy and explicit sex scenes but these centerpiece couplings depend on the sort of officially ""hot"" devices (feverish foreplay while standing against a wall a shirt being ripped open the aforementioned bondage) that are no longer shocking or even very titillating. Most of the scenes make such a big point of being daring -- Look Is that Michael Douglas performing oral sex? -- that theyre less erotic than showy. At one point the characters go to an ambisexual dance club and the leering ""decadence"" is shoved in our faces. You half expect the place to be called Dantes Inferno. The man killed in the opening scene was a retired rock star whod been sleeping with Catherine Tramell (Stone). Shes a rich seductress and as it turns out a writer who has recently published a novel about -- yes -- a rock star who was bound during sex and murdered with an ice pick. Is Catherine the killer? Or is someone trying to frame her? Since there are only two other possible suspects (one of them Catherines lesbian lover is barely a character) the movie doesnt exactly put us in a vise of suspense. Its more like a game of either/or. Enter Nick Curran (Douglas) a cop suffering guilt pangs from an incident in which he killed several tourists. A former alcoholic and coke fiend Nick has gone cold turkey and even quit smoking. Meeting the luscious Catherine puts an end to that though. During an interrogation at the police station (the most entertaining scene in the movie) she teases Nick and the other men into a hormonal sweat tossing out dirty little comments like firecrackers and uncrossing her legs to reveal her taste in underwear (none). It doesnt take long for Nick the born substance abuser to get the message This woman is the ultimate bad habit. Sharon Stone in her first major-league role comes on like a postfeminist Grace Kelly. She turns her haughty slightly blank cheerleader sexiness into something vampish and ominous -- an all-American beauty mask. Douglas as always plays a rotter hero with style. Catherine and Nick are drawn to the anger in each others sexuality. The movie can make explicit the sadomasochistic impulses that were hinted at in the dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. If only Basic Instinct had a little of their slyness and logic The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven the talented Dutch-born filmmaker who made the dazzlingly nihilistic RoboCop (1987) and the amusing but ludicrous Total Recall (1990). In ""Basic Instinct"" he must have decided to play the clunky implausible script as a semi-joke. It says much about the state of movies today that 3 million buys dialogue like ""Youre dealing with a devious diabolical mind"" or the destined-to-be-quoted ""Shes evil...and brilliant"" The film practically dares us to giggle at how obvious it is. When Catherine fixes Nick a drink at her seaside mansion she takes out an ice pick and a block of ice and begins hacking away. The moment is meant to be borderline ridiculous. What the filmmakers dont quite seem to realize is that an overwrought cliche is still a cliche.

"Basic Instinct | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; basic-instinct ) Basic Instinct (United States 1992) A movie review by James Berardinelli In my original unpublished review of Basic Instinct (dated March 21 1992) I wrote the following ""Theres a fine line between eroticism and exploitation and Basic Instinct treads it using nudity sex and violence to cover up the limitations of the story. Nevertheless it delivers what it promises a fast-moving often-implausible thriller that glories in the lurid and the bloody."" In fact Basic Instinct resembles nothing more than one of those Z-grade soft core thrillers that Cinemax seems to have an endless supply of. But the big difference between those movies and this one is easy to identify. Instead of employing obscure actors and craftsman Basic Instinct has a credit list thats A-list from top to bottom actors Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop) scribe Joe Eszterhas (Jagged Edge) cinematographer Jan De Bont (Die Hard) and composer Jerry Goldsmith. The films problems begin with its story which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience from the opening scene (in which a naked blond woman - whose features are obscured by her hair - is shown ice picking someone to death) to the final shot. As Basic Instinct wraps many viewers will experience a sense of having been cheated and the depth of the films deception becomes evident upon deconstruction. Joe Eszterhas screenplay doesnt make sense and he doesnt bother to hide this fact. In the end Basic Instinct teases and screws us with the same efficiency that the films femme fatale handles the protagonist. SFPD Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and his partner Gus (George Dzundza) have been called in to investigate the brutal murder of a has-been rock star. The chief suspect is his favorite sex partner author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone). Tramell was seen with the victim on the night of his demise and the method of the slaying mimics a death in one of her murder mysteries. For Nick who is under investigation by Internal Affairs for the accidental shooting of two tourists Catherine is like a drug. He believes shes guilty but hes addicted to her. Even the warnings of his former lover and current psychologist Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn) cant keep him away. Is Catherine guilty or has she been framed? This is the central mystery of Basic Instinct and the film never solves it. Instead Estzerhas and Paul Verhoeven offer a resolution that can be seen as confirming either possibility. Such a conclusion might work in a more psychologically challenging picture but Basic Instinct is an exploitation genre entry through-and-through. An ambiguous conclusion in these circumstances leads to frustration. It makes the filmmakers come across as calculating charlatans using ticket buyers for their dupes. Basic Instinct didnt launch Sharon Stones career but it catapulted her to the next level. Stone gambled that by showing everything (although she claims the infamous crotch shot was filmed without her ""consent"") she would end up on the fast track. It worked. Stone became a hot commodity although its worth noting that only the films in which she had nude scenes met with box office success. Her ability as an actress became eclipsed by her physical attributes. And she is a good actress; her performance in Basic Instinct is strong. Catherine is the pictures sole interesting character and thats in part because of Stones portrayal. With Stone stealing center stage top billed Michael Douglas was unintentionally forced into a supporting role. (Theres no way Douglas butt shots could compare to what Stone exhibited.) He plays the stale standby of the maverick cop with weaknesses for drink drugs cigarettes and women. George Dzundza is okay in the clichA(c)d partner part although theres nothing out of the ordinary about this character. Jeanne Tripplehorn is awful as Beth Garner although part of this is no doubt due to the writing. Denise Richards was more convincing as a nuclear physicist in one of the James Bond movies. The dialogue is laughably cheesy throughout but perhaps thats part of Basic Instincts appeal. In fact there are times when the film comes close to achieving a status where its so bad it becomes entertaining. And theres plenty of gore and Tamp;A. The final theatrical edit came so close to an NC-17 that it had to be cut and re-submitted several times before a hard R was granted. Whether or not the film works depends largely on expectations. If youre looking for an intelligent thriller with real characters Basic Instinct will seem like a fraud. If on the other hand you dont care whether the story makes sense and all youre in search of are cheap thrills and naked bodies the movie delivers. Then again so does a lot of Cinemaxs late night programming.

Comments Basic Instinct Rated R  127 minutes  2013 Reviewing Paul Verhoevens 1979 Dutch feature The 4th Man Dave Kehr objected to ""conceptions of women as castrating harpies and of gays as predatory beasts that are insulting to all the sexualities involved."" Working from a script by Joe Eszterhas Verhoeven did an even better job of hammering home those notions with Basic Instinct (1992). I hated this movie when it was released but on reflection I think that his appreciation of Sharon Stone as dominatrix/superwoman had a lot to do with what made her a star. Verhoeven also treats Michael Douglas playing a gullible cop with the kind of comic-book flourishes that might easily pass for derisiveness and sometimes come across as just plain hilarious. Despite (or maybe because of) his obligatory nods to Hitchcock this is slick and entertaining enough to work as thriller porn even with two contradictory denouements to its mystery (take your pick--or rather ice pick). George Dzundza and Dorothy Malone are among the other actors along for the ride.

Basic Instinct is grade-A pulp fiction. This erotically charged thriller about the search for an ice-pick murderer in San Francisco rivets attention through its sleek style attractive cast doing and thinking kinky things and story which is as weirdly implausible as it is intensely visceral. Tale gets off to a slambang start when at the peak of mutual sexual excitement an unidentifiable blonde ties up her lovers hands and does him in. Back on the streets of San Francisco detective Michael Douglas and partner George Dzundza head up the coast to quiz the dead mans g.f. the fabulously wealthy and sexy Sharon Stone who has published a novel in which an identical murder is depicted. The very tough and ice-cold Stone quickly begins tantalizing Douglas who has recently gone cold turkey off cigarettes booze drugs and sex. Stone bends Douglas so out of shape that in the first torrid sex scene he roughly assaults his former lover and police department shrink (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Stone remains the prime suspect all the way through the tale which includes four more killings. The extensively intertwined sexual histories of Douglas Stone and Tripplehorn not to mention Stones jealous female lover (Leilani Sarelle) throws suspicion all over the place. Douglas scores with a game and gamey portrayal of an iconoclastic cop not afraid to go over the line professionally or personally. After a decade of marking time in schlockers Stone has a career-making role here as a beautiful smart manipulator who is always several steps ahead of everyone else.

"Basic Instinct Related Item Go to Video Finder Basic Instinct By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer March 20 1992 Director Paul Verhoeven Cast Michael Douglas; Sharon Stone; George Dzundza; Jeanne Tripplehorn; Stephen Tobolowsky Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa If youre unfamiliar with the genitalia of either gender ""Basic Instinct"" is the movie that will clear things up. Its nothing if not steamy. And if youre an aspiring serial killer this thriller has some excellent pointers on multiple stabbings.Michael Douglas is a San Francisco detective living on the edge. He has the usual jaded detective problems He drinks does a little cocaine and accidentally shot some tourists in the line of duty. Hes in therapeutic remission now reporting regularly to police shrink Jeanne Tripplehorn -- who is also his on-again off-again girlfriend.When a grisly icepick murder takes place he gets erotically and romantically involved with initial suspect Sharon Stone a bisexual author who happens to have written a novel that duplicates the crime detail for detail. Sex and violence bind the pair together.Unfortunately little else in this movie binds together. Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas who did ""Jagged Edge"" and ""The Music Box"" resorts to his tired old elements including illicit love on both sides of the law and a murder weapon that ends up being the macabre punchline. The result -- despite a barrage of flesh hacking shooting red herrings and bed-bumping -- is a predictable surprisingly uninvolving affair.There are those who have demonstrated against ""Instinct"" for its negative portrayal of lesbians and bisexuals. Theyre forgetting the heterosexuals. Everyones negatively portrayed in this business-as-usual slasher. The movies all but devoid of character. Sure there are two-legged beings resembling cops murderers lesbians bisexuals and old ladies. But theyre blunt formulaic creations even by action-movie standards.Director Paul Verhoeven a man who never met a scene he couldnt overblow gives this thrill show everything hes got. But hes stylistically inept. He just blunders ahead with rudimentary suspense tactics. He fared better with robots (""RoboCop"") and Austrian bodybuilders (""Total Recall"").The second half of ""Instinct"" is better than the first mainly because finding the identity of a killer is intrinsically fascinating no matter what youre watching. Its the movie-going equivalent of rubbernecking. What isnt so fascinating is this movies absurdity of motivation. No one does anything that makes sense. No one seems real. When the actual perpetrator is uncovered there is no enlightenment as to why the killing occurred.Principals Douglas and Stone give you little to really care about. They trade quips and play sexual cat and mouse but theres nothing below the surface. Its only Douglass big-name presence that puts any oomph into his character. Its only Stones nudity that puts anything into hers. Shes supposed to be an author but when she finds time to type a single word -- between all these encounters with Douglas and emotionally hotheaded lover Leilani Sarelle -- is anyones guess. Unfortunately Eszterhas did find that kind of time.

"Basic Instinct Related Item Go to Video Finder Basic Instinct By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer March 20 1992 Director Paul Verhoeven Cast Michael Douglas; Sharon Stone; George Dzundza; Jeanne Tripplehorn; Stephen Tobolowsky sex violence and profanity Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa Far from an attack on lesbians ""Basic Instinct"" is a panting peep at the misperceptions and cliches surrounding female sexuality. For that matter its lesbian love scenes -- a few gropes and kisses -- do less to develop the leading ladys character than they do to titillate the leading mans. When pretty push comes to sweaty shove this sleekly made skin-flick is an extended Hustler magazine fantasy whose heroine isnt a little butch shes metaphorically male. The she-thing at the heart of this pulp romp isnt a woman but a drag queen (nothing against drag queens).A darkly phobic lust story ""Basic Instinct"" pits a tanned and creased Michael Douglas against a suspected man-killer played with Amazonian disdain by an unforgettable Sharon Stone. The coolest blonde since Kim Novak Stone marries the beef-mangling broad she played in ""Total Recall"" with a haughty jade out of Hitchcocks worst nightmare. Though officially a bisexual Catherine is more of a sexual omnivore. She would make a houseplant if she thought it would do anything for her. When shes not partying hard in one of San Franciscos kickier clubs Catherine pens lurid murder mysteries that have an unhealthy way of coming true for the protagonists -- like the rock star whom detective Nick Curran (Douglas) finds stabbed to death and tied to the bedpost.Douglas who grunts and snorts fetchingly becomes obsessed not only with Catherines beauty but her cunning. In a scene no one will forget any time soon Catherine -- who disdains underwear -- flashes a roomful of panting heaving detectives when she is brought in for questioning. ""I like men who give me pleasure"" she coos. Confronted with this brazen power play the cops cant wait to get rid of her. But not the hot-tempered trigger-happy Nick. An addictive personality he finds himself yearning to be tied up and tied down (literally with a white silk Hermes scarf).If she is the killer then he will die of multiple orgasms -- with maybe a little help from an ice pick. Nick isnt in California anymore. Hes inched beyond the ""Sea of Love"" into the ""Realm of the Senses"" where the sentence for sexual addiction is about ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with time off for getting in touch with ones feelings.But can Nick or any of us really trust those feelings?Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas doesnt think so. Hes made a career out of certifying the notion that love is blind. His fourth film on the subject ""Basic Instinct"" is obviously a reiteration of the stories and subtexts of his earlier films ""Jagged Edge"" ""Betrayed"" and ""Music Box."" Writing to a population battered with headlines about pedophiles cannibals one-man sperm banks sleep-around pols Eszterhas exploits all of our fashionable fears.Not missing a beat ""Basic Instinct"" includes a variation on unethical head shrinkers that sees Nick ripping the Freudian slip right off Dr. Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn). A police psychologist assigned to counsel the temperamental detective Dr. Garner is also a more typical Eszterhas heroine the type whose professionalism seldom gets the best of her libido. And she comes off well compared with Catherines insanely jealous fratricidal lover (Leilani Sarelle) and husband-whacking buddy (Dorothy Malone). What we have here is a movie with not just one but a family pack of psychos.Dutch director Paul Verhoeven of the flashy thrillers ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" might just as well be directing androids as actors for all the real angst he finds within them. These actors seem driven less by real emotions than Eveready bunny batteries. Perhaps Verhoeven unlike Eszterhas has already said all he had to say about castrating sexually ambiguous women in his superior ""The Fourth Man"" a Holland-set noir thriller.""Basic Instinct"" is rated R for sex violence and profanity.
