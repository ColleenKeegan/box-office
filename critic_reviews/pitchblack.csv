Starring Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell. Directed by David Twohy. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some people are going to think ""Pitch Black"" might be a better movie if the screen was more often. Pitch black that is. This half-baked sci-fi horror film filled with jerky washed-out highlighted blurred and toned imagery is a tiresome experience. For all the visual mucking about it lacks a genuine style. It stars Vin Diesel (""Saving Private Ryan"") who appears in a much better film also opening today ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Ribisi. HIGH ART ACTRESS Radha Mitchell the Australian actress who made a considerable impression in ""High Art"" with Ally Sheedy co-stars in a role that if nothing else at least shows her versatility. She plays a spacecraft officer who crash-lands on a planet where a bounty hunter (Cole Hauser) is transporting an incorrigible killer (Diesel). The planet is either blindingly lighted by three suns or pitch black when they are in eclipse. Monsters come out where the suns dont shine. The buff tank-topped killer at first gagged and strapped in what appears to be some sort of S-M contraption has had a ""surgical shine job"" on his eyeballs which not only makes them gleam but gives him night vision. ""Pitch Black"" pits mad- dog killer against monsters that come out of the dark. Eyeballs are a curious theme in this film. The bounty hunter is addicted to morphine and shoots up in his eyeball. STRANGE CRITTERS The creatures seem to fall in two categories batlike things that swarm and incongruous critters that are bony tentacled and shark-toothed all at once. Fortunately they have a blind spot right in front of their spiny nose. The spacecraft passengers are a mixed bag too including for some reason a band of devout Muslims and an antiquities dealer () given to arch witticisms that arent funny who at one point appears to be coming on to the macho-man deep-voiced Diesel. Well its something. ..

Mildly scary but not particularly engaging on any other level David Twohys derivative tale concerns a pilot who crash-lands her spacecraft on a distant hot planet inhabited by mysterious creatures. Basically plotless ""Pitch Black"" the new Aussie-lensed sci-fi thriller is a bargain-basement ""Aliens."" Mildly scary but not particularly engaging on any other level David Twohys derivative tale concerns a pilot (played by the beautiful Radha Mitchell in a Sigourney Weaver-like role) who crash-lands her spacecraft on a distant hot planet inhabited by mysterious creatures. No-name cast mostly unlikable characters and lukewarm visual and sound effects suggest a quick theatrical playoff en route to a slightly better life on video. Twohy who helmed ""The Arrival"" and ""Disaster in Time"" spins a tale that recalls B-grade 50s sci-fi rather than state-of-the-art genre items in its one-dimensional characterizations and mostly indifferent f/x. The only element that delivers in this disappointing feature is Graeme Revells striking score which creates a menacing mood much more effectively than the plot itself. Adventures set in an unspecified not-too-distant future. Most of the spaceships crew is killed in the crash-landing; only pilot Fry (Mitchell) lawman Johns (Cole Hauser) and prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel) emerge unharmed. Latter is a convicted murderer whose presence threatens the future of the survivors. Whats notable about the seemingly arid planet where the spacecraft is stranded is its brutal daytime heat. Headed by Fry the group can hope for survival only at night except that strange hunting creatures emerge after dark. As conceived and fabricated by Patrick Tatopoulos and John Cox these monsters look like a cross between big birds and dinosaurs. Yarn rehashes cliches of numerous similar adventures in which a small bunch of disparate survivors is forced to unify despite internal conflicts. Sci-fi premises are soon abandoned and pic assumes the shape of a routine action-adventure with each of the three central characters vying for dominance. With the exception of a few twists (one concerning a characters true gender) and a surprising subplot that relates to Johns identity episodic plot is redundant and not particularly involving. Brothers Jim and Ken Wheat who have scripted a number of cheesy sequels for the big and small screen (""The Fly II"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master"" and ""The Birds II Lands End"") are unable to sustain tension. Worse a number of the characters are simply not interesting enough to generate viewer sympathy or concern over their survival. Tech credits for what seems to be a small-budget sci-fi are average with production design by reliable pro Graham ""Grace"" Walker a notch or two above the rest. Ferocious attacks by the planets monstrous creatures manage only partially to alleviate the tedium that defines the movie.

A slam actually as a hurtling spaceship under the docking direction of a brisk pilot named Fry (High Arts Radha Mitchell) makes a crash landing onto an unknown planet. The rest of the crew is killed; the passengers are all shook up and emerge ahead of schedule from their transport comas blinking and bleeding in a seemingly lifeless land. The customers are a typically colorful gang of the doomed a Muslim imam (Keith David) and three pilgrims headed for New Mecca an intrepid geologist (Claudia Black) a simpering antiques dealer (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) a runaway teenager (Rhiana Griffith) a grim lawman (Cole Hauser) and -- as sinner and saint -- a murderous prisoner called Riddick (Boiler Rooms Vin Diesel) whose capacity for violence is signaled by the manacles blindfold and gag worthy of Hannibal Lecter that restrain him. And each discovers that this brutally hot eerily quiet planet -- scorched by three suns -- is filled with lethal creatures who prey only in the dark. Oh and a total eclipse is coming. Among the movies recycled components Fry as a next-generation heroine owes her job to the gender barriers broken by Aliens Ripley; Riddicks ancestry can be traced all the way back to the Beast who saved Beauty; and the fussing sybarite might have been played by Edward Everett Horton. The rampaging aliens meanwhile are your average downmarket menaces; they look like irradiated escapees from Jurassic Park and they squawk reeee-reee-reee as they pounce and devour. But Pitch Black is so jaunty so limber and so visually self-assured that art peeks through where crap has traditionally made its home. Director-cowriter David Twohy (The Arrival) has made more of the latter -- he cowrote Waterworld and G.I. Jane. But he lucked out with his collaborators Cinematographer David Eggby and production designer Graham ""Grace"" Walker both worked on various Mad Max movies and they bring to Pitch Black that same disorienting thrill of a world turned upside down. (Its a small galaxy after all -- like George Millers seminal futuristic saga this was shot in the Australian end-of-the-road pit stop called Coober Pedy.) Rarely has the unknown looked so grubby and yet so beautiful; rarely have crash landings felt so visceral. Besides the movies outlaw aesthetics liberate relatively unknown actors to make the most out of characters sketchier than guests on the Enterprise. I particularly like Mitchell as Fry with her peppery whiff of melancholy. And I enjoy even more the developing relationship between Fry and Riddick who as played with growly gusto by Diesel is a useful desperado of the future He can see the way forward in the darkness much as Pitch Black can see the light in sci-fi formulas.

"Pitch Black | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pitch-black ) Pitch Black (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its Vin Diesel week Suddenly this largely unknown actor whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character) is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black as they show different aspects of the actors range. In Boiler Room hes a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode flexing his muscles grunting and uttering the occasional one liner. Its not an especially challenging part but Diesel handles it with aplomb. Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often) Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one the only question is whos going to be next. The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance things become routine from a storyline perspective but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And for those who are bothered by such things the films so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics. The movie begins with the crash a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell) the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser) a police officer; Riddick (Diesel) a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing Riddick escapes but while the survivors are looking for him they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse everyone must learn to trust Riddick who can see in the dark if they are to survive. Meanwhile its unclear whether Riddicks primary goal is self-preservation or redemption. The acting is solid if largely unremarkable. Most of the principals have fallen effortlessly into the stereotyped roles of quirky characters who are basically waiting to be the aliens next meal. (Although there are a few surprises when considering who lives through the carnage. I definitely did not correctly predict the composition of the surviving group.) The performers to rise above are Diesel who relishes the larger-than-life opportunity and Radha Mitchell who gives a convincing portrayal of a tough emotionally conflicted woman. Theres a little of Sigourney Weavers Ripley in Fry but this is not a direct copy. For the Australian-born Mitchell who has done her share of work on the indie scene (Love and Other Catastrophes High Art) this represents an opportunity to be seen by a wider audience. Pitch Black has a stylish look. The outdoor sequences which are nearly monochromatic to emphasize the color-leeching power of the multiple suns are effectively photographed. After the eclipse occurs there are some genuinely creepy sequences featuring packs of aliens honing in on the protagonists who are only able to keep them at bay by waving around lights. For the most part the special effects are first-rate - I was impressed by the scene of a ringed planet sliding across the sky on its way to block out the sun. These strong visuals complement a workmanlike script resulting in a consistently engaging science fiction/horror excursion.
