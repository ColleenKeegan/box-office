Film Add review 0 Love It Save it 0 Add review 0 Love It Save it Time Out says Details Users say Time Out says Unless you thought Richard Gere was the best thing in Chicago tread carefully with this comedy drama in which he plays John a middle-aged man who secretly attends dance lessons. Geres monotone performance means we can only guess at the reason for his characters subterfuge presumably a combination of manly embarrassment and a fascination with dance teacher Paulina (played by Jennifer Lopez who proves as insipid as both Gere and plot).Much like a time-passing TV movie Shall We Dance offers attractive inoffensive characters and a smattering of broad laughs but it fails to use its potential to explore weightier themes such as Johns mid-life crisis. In the opening narration he briefly articulates his sense of ennui but its not effectively communicated in either Geres performance or the ensuing narrative. And while Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci offer glimmers of hope as Johns wife and friend much of their spark is reined in by the superficial script thats as bland as the perplexingly successful Japanese film on which its based.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Toeing the Cliched Line washingtonpost.com  gt; Print Edition  gt; WeekendPrint This ArticleE-Mail This Article   i>>?      RSS News FeedsTop NewsPrint EditionWhat is RSS? | All RSS Feeds Toeing the Cliched LineBy Jen ChaneySpecial to The Washington PostFriday October 15 2004; Page WE33 NO ONE needs a session at Arthur Murray to keep up with the moves in ""Shall We Dance?"" Before youve even digested that first kernel of popcorn youll know exactly whats about to happen in this occasionally charming but ultimately forgettable bit of fox-trot fluff.A precious few will recognize the plot points from the 1996 Japanese film of the same name that inspired this Hollywoodized version starring Richard Gere Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Others will have seen the commercials for this movie which clearly lay out its beginning middle and end for those who cant already predict the conventional storyline. Indeed ""Shall We Dance?"" follows the formula of virtually every dance picture that came before it -- ""Dirty Dancing"" ""Strictly Ballroom"" heck even ""Lambada.""In this version Gere plays the role of weary repressed protagonist John Clark a lawyer and family man whose daily routine has drained him of joie de vivre. That is until one evening while taking his usual ride home on Chicagos El train when he spots the beautiful melancholy face of a mysterious woman (Lopez) gazing out the window of Miss Mitzis Dance School. Compelled by her image he musters the courage to enter Miss Mitzis and sign up for classes in the hope of getting closer to her. To his surprise (but not the audiences) he winds up discovering the thrill of ballroom dancing. His feet become so happy that he continues his lessons and even enters a ballroom dance competition all the while slowly forming a friendship with Lopezs Paulina. Of course he keeps his twinkle-toed persona under wraps prompting his wife (Sarandon) to hire a private detective (""Six Feet Unders"" Richard Jenkins) to find out whether an extramarital affair is whats keeping her husband away from home.While Gere brings a sophisticated salt-and-pepper-haired sexiness to his Mr. Nice Guy role Lopez doesnt really register. Despite one semi-steamy rehearsal sequence the two dont set off many sparks. Gere and Sarandon fare much better in the chemistry department a fact that perhaps inadvertently makes the movies conclusion all the more expected. (No need for a spoiler alert here. Im not telling you anything the commercials havent already made blatantly obvious.) The high points of ""Dance"" actually come from the casts supporting players. Stanley Tucci brings his usual energy to his part as a balding fellow lawyer and gifted dancer who dons a Fabio-esque wig whenever he hits the floor. And Lisa Ann Walters performance as Bobbie a dance student in dire need of a long sit-down with Miss Manners is infused with just enough vulnerability to make the otherwise obnoxious character seem likable.Ultimately whats most disappointing about ""Shall We Dance?"" isnt the cliched dialogue or the fact that it repeats almost every step of the Japanese version. Its the lack of an electrifying knock-em-dead killer dance sequence a violation of Rule No. 1 in the Dance Movie Handbook. A hot choreographed routine during a dance movies climactic scene is what makes all those cheesy plot developments almost bearable. Even the kids in ""Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo"" knew that. Though there are some lovely waltzes no scene truly razzle-dazzles. And for a film that stars ""Chicagos"" Billy Flynn and a former ""In Living Color"" Fly Girl dancer thats more than a violation. Thats a sin. SHALL WE DANCE? (PG-13 106 minutes) -- Contains some sexual references and brief bits of objectionable language. Area theaters.

"Richard Gere Falls All Over Himself in Shall We Dance? washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Richard Gere Falls All Over Himself in Shall We Dance? Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 15 2004 ""Shall We Dance?"" takes a small exquisite Japanese movie and turns it into a big stupid American movie. Still it must be said that as glossy and overproduced as the thing is its a good Big Stupid American movie. In the original Koji Yakusho played a successful but browbeaten accountant who each night goes home shoehorned into a bullet train and passing a ballroom dancing studio with a beautiful girl in the window becomes entranced. Hes married hes got a career his life is on the tracks to forever but . . . just looking at her he feels a certain yearning not for sex explicitly but for the possibilities she represents even if hes not quite sure what those are. One night screwing up his courage he gets off the train enters the dance hall and becomes part of a whole new world. He achieves for the first time in his harried pressured life a sort of happiness in the arms of a beautiful woman who knows how to cha-cha. They do a lot of cha-cha and some rumba some tango but no hoo-ha. The innocence of the entire construction was a part of the charm as was the halting shy performance of Yakusho who made you ache for the loneliness of the salaryman in a conformist rule- and face-driven culture like Japans. Now let me give you two words that indicate totally why this concept will not quite work when Americanized The two words are ""Richard"" and ""Gere."" Yes that guy. The silky seductive Gere with a luscious foam of gray-tipped hair and no pink pate gleaming through cheekbones like umbrella knobs smoldering eyes and a way of moving as if his hip joints were lubricated with 10W-40. The kind of guy who looks good in Armani and Gargoyle shades. The kind of guy who might star in a movie called ""American Gigolo."" So Gere is all wrong for the part and he never begins to convince. Worse his life -- though he seems to evoke its melancholy in an overdone voiceover reminiscent in tone to Bob Segers classic of self-pity ""Turn the Page"" -- seems far from desperate. Hes a Chicago lawyer who lives at the end of the northbound El tracks. Great house great little town great family great wife (Susan Sarandon with those big eyes and hyper-intelligent demeanor as close to perfection as a man has a right to hope for). So youre thinking from the start whats this guy so sad about? The only possible answer He doesnt have J.Lo. And thats J.Lo lounging in the window of Miss Mitzis Dance Studio her hair drawn back so tightly it must hurt her soulful demeanor as depressed as a grieving widow. Honey maybe if you loosen the hair that headache will go away. Anyway like his Japanese antecedent Geres John Clark goes in and signs up for lessons in ballroom. Do such places still exist in America? A quick check of Anywho.com reveals that they do so you cant fault the movie on its detail even if Miss Mitzis studio looks like a crew of professional art directors spent 5 million in an attempt to portray a hall that rents for 250 a month. Thats one of the many oversize flourishes that characterize the film in goofy but not really annoying ways. Clark of course doesnt immediately get one-on-ones with the beauteous remote Paulina (Jennifer Lopez); instead hes one of three guys who are taught by the estimable if venerable Mitzi (Anita Gillette) herself and soon he and new buddies Nick Cannon and Bobby Cannavale are slithering around the floor or standing before mirrors trying to free that right shoulder to perform the contrapuntal undulations so necessary to Latin dance rhythms. Meanwhile now and then Paulina can be glimpsed through the glass doors tripping the light fantastic in backlit silhouette a beautiful dream. The movie is best actually in its evocation of community. The three guys wildly separate in origin class and education bond (doncha love it when that happens in the movies?) and as much as Miss Mitzi loves them the amusing hanger-on Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter) a busty dancin fool with a personality as big as all outdoors loves them even more. Wheres the love? Heres the love. Meanwhile back in Wilmette or wherever (maybe its Winnetka; it looked like posh Kenilworth to me) wife Beverly is beginning to notice the sweat on her husbands shirts and his persistent pattern of working late on Wednesday nights. Next thing you know to add another comic dimension of complication shes hired a sad-sack shamus (Richard Jenkins) and his hip-hoppy assistant (Omar Miller) to investigate. As a beginning dancer Gere doesnt quite work because he moves so sveltely from the start. Its not like an inner Fred Astaire has been released from a klutz; he was already Fred Astaire. He just didnt have that far to go. As for J.Lo its hard to tell. The movie is so tilted toward mythologizing Lopezs physical presence (particularly a certain part of it if you know what I mean and I think you do) with the most sophisticated lighting techniques that she seems more like a brilliantly photographed supermodel than an actual physical person. As a dancer she lacks that charisma of movement the great ones had (yes I know she was a Fly Girl) and theres a moment when the dance students pass in front of a store and watch Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse light up the town in 1953s ""The Band Wagon"" that really shows you how incandescent dance can be on film and reminds you that the dance in this film is far from incandescent. But more works than doesnt. Fine comic spins from an old-pro character yeoman like Jenkins plus freshness from both Cannavale and Cannon and a hey-look-me-over bust-out from Walter all connect. Then theres a moment when Gere faces the mirror ostensibly to work on loosening up that Latin shoulder and his eyes meet his eyes in reflection and I thought This guy has done this before Why do you think he knows anything about narcissism? Shall We Dance? (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for adult themes.

Do yourself a favor and rent the 1996 original from Japan instead. Its hard to buy either Richard Gere or Jennifer Lopez in their Dance roles. Making matters worse the supporting players are wasted. Miramax The new film starring Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere turns a sweet lilting story into a clunky cliched and tedious movie sitcom. (Related video Watch the Shall We Dance trailer) The problem lies in taking a tale set in Tokyo that reflected a repressive aspect of Japanese culture and transplanting it to Chicago in a less-stifling American environment. Its harder to buy the basic premise of a man dragged down and saddened by his workaday life when that man is played by an actor as dashing and charismatic as Gere. His character is more well-to-do less reclusive and not as deeply discontented as the original films leading man but he is nagged by the feeling that his life is missing passion and excitement. About the movie Shall We Dance?  1/5 (out of four) Stars Richard Gere Jennifer Lopez Susan Sarandon Directors Peter Chelsom Distributor Miramax Pictures Rated PG-13 for some sexual references and brief language Opens Friday nationwide He finds those things by learning to dance -- and we dont buy it for a minute. Gere even is given a glamorous wife played by Susan Sarandon and two loving teenage children to leaven his admittedly trying job as a tax attorney. Gere rides a train to and from work passing a ballroom dance studio. Hes lured initially by the sight of an enigmatic woman gazing pensively out the studios window. Jennifer Lopez plays the mysterious beauty and she is seriously miscast. Rather than projecting an aura of melancholy she comes across as sullen. In a climactic final scene she is more Jenny from the Block than a serious dancer. Her exhibitionist character is a far cry from the graceful dancer portrayed in the Japanese original. Critical chemistry between Gere and Lopez is lacking as well. The supporting comic characters are given cartoonish parts all the more disappointing because some of these actors had impressive turns in other movies. Bobby Cannavale so wonderful in The Station Agent is wasted here as a guy who takes dance lessons to meet girls. Ditto for the strong character actor Richard Jenkins who plays a private detective hired by Sarandon to follow Gere. Nick Cannon so winning in Drumline has a thankless role as Jenkins assistant. Stanley Tucci as Geres co-worker and Lisa Ann Walter as a loudmouth aspiring dancer are particularly obnoxious. The cast of dancers led by Lopez and Anita Gillette as teachers is so one-dimensional that we dont care what happens to them in the final competition. The Australian hit Strictly Ballroom had a much more compelling collection of eccentrics to cheer for. Shall We Dance? falls into the ""why bother?"" category of so many remakes.

(AP Photo/ David James / Miramax Films) ... more Photo DAVID JAMES It takes two to tango but a good script also helps Beverly seems to be seducing private eye 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Shall We Dance? Romantic comedy. Starring Richard Gere Jennifer Lopez Susan Sarandon Stanley Tucci Bobby Cannavale and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Peter Chelsom. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Something crucial got lost in translation in Hollywoods remake of ""Shall We Dance?"" The title and story line are the same as the transcendent Japanese film about a businessman who waltzes his way out of a midlife crisis. But where the original soared the new version hugs the ground. Its like the difference between Fred Astaire s dancing and Richard Geres. His hoofer role in ""Chicago"" must have gone to Geres head or more accurately his feet. As unlikely ballroom dance aficionado John Clark Gere gets the steps right even if in the early going he has to keep count. Hes particularly graceful when led around the floor by ace teacher Paulina played by Jennifer Lopez with a sweet modesty she hasnt displayed onscreen in a long time. It becomes her as does Geres appealing looks of astonishment when his character boldly takes the lead. But ""Shall We Dance?"" missteps with its tortured explanations for what possesses John to slip into a pair of patent leather dance shoes as improbable a choice of footwear for this button-down estate lawyer as Dorothys red slippers. In an unfortunate voice-over John ruminates about the nature of his profession. Clients come to him with their assets and debits to tally up and then wonder if thats all there is to life. (You halfway expect to hear Miss Peggy Lee croon you-know-what song.) John has a number of assets including a sensational wife Beverly (the sensational Susan Sarandon not given nearly enough to do) and family. Hes presented as a man who has everything leaving his wife in a quandary over what to buy for his birthday even though shes a department store executive. Heading home nightly on a Chicago elevated train John looks up and sees something he wants -- Paulina who is pensively gazing out the window of Miss Mitzis Dance School. One evening he impulsively gets off the train and inquires about classes. Its perfectly understandable that John would be eager to go cheek to cheek with this luscious instructor. Her high cheekbones arent the only cheeks he might dream of caressing as anyone who has ever seen Lopez from the rear -- and who hasnt? -- knows. But John is stuck with the much older Miss Mitzi. Furthermore when he invites Paulina to dinner she lectures him on how she doesnt come with the dance classes. Soon its voice-over time again. John is heard pondering about his clients who move to a desert island opposed to those who continue their humdrum ways. As clever as screenwriter Audrey Wells (""The Truth About Cats amp; Dogs"") can be shes not going to convince anyone that liberation lies in the two-step. Wells and director Peter Chelsom seem to realize theyre in trouble when the possibility of a romance between John and Paulina evaporates. The innocence of their attraction becomes increasingly hard to buy. To keep the film moving along if not gliding a host of other characters are introduced although not fully developed. Stanley Tucci hams it up as a lawyer in Johns firm whos a closet ballroom dancer. Theres a truly funny moment when he illustrates a tricky step for John in the mens room at their office. The two have their arms around each other when a colleague walks in. Without missing a beat John yells ""Call 911"" while his partner collapses into a heap. Bobby Cannavale so wonderful in ""The Station Agent"" fares less well here as a determinedly macho dance student. Richard Jenkins -- the father who comes back from the dead in ""Six Feet Under"" -- is almost as ghostly as a detective Beverly hires to see if her husband is cheating. Showing a lot of cleavage Beverly takes him out for a drink to say hes off the case after learning of the dance lessons (which John inexplicably keeps secret from her). From all appearances shes trying to seduce the private eye since she could have fired him by telephone. But nothing comes of their tete-a-tete as if the filmmakers realized they already had enough subplots. Chelsom who made the magical ""Funny Bones"" about a decade ago in his native England has yet to find his way in Hollywood going from directing dreadful studio movies such as ""Town amp; Country"" to ones that are nothing special like his latest. Considering the talent on both sides of the camera and a story that worked beautifully the first time around ""Shall We Dance?"" should have been a lot better than OK. -- Advisory This film contains mildly suggestive sexual scenes.

LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""Shall We Dance?"" an American remake of the sweet 1996 Japanese film of the same name is an ill-fated attempt to translate a wonderful foreign-language film for American audiences -- and it falls apart on its own too.This film is not only out of step it has two left feet.Both films are about the healing powers of self-expression. But the original also had strong cultural touchstones regarding dance. Public displays of affection and the close proximity of bodies required for ballroom dancing -- even between a husband and wife -- are considered shameful in traditional Japanese culture. The dance students in the original film defied their tightly bound society with a powerful act of nonconformity.That is not the case in the 2004 American remake -- and the lack of subtext drains the film of the heartfelt power of the original.The new ""Shall We Dance?"" stars Richard Gere as Chicago lawyer John Clark and Jennifer Lopez as Paulina a dance instructor.Clarks life looks picture-perfect. He loves his wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) and their two children. In fact hes living the American dream in a beautiful home and should feel content and happy. But hes not.Every night while taking the train home from work he passes a mournfully run-down dance studio called Miss Mitzis. Standing in the window is Paulina a forlorn but beautiful woman who turns out to be one of the studios instructors. Shes been damaged by an event in her past.Not true to lifeClark begins to feel a deep inner connection to Paulina. One night gets off the train to sign up for a beginners series of ballroom dance lessons. Gradually he begins to bond with a group of equally unhappy people played by Stanley Tucci Bobby Cannavale Omar Miller and Leslie Ann Walter. (The dance studios owner is played by Anita Gillette.)As John begins to feel lighter and lighter on his feet his spirits also begin to lighten and he starts to find some new meaning in his life. He also finds it increasingly impossible to share his secret with his wife.Now were supposed to feel that Geres character is afraid his wife will somehow assume his need to dance is a sign of being unfulfilled in their marriage rather than going against a social norm. And theres also that annoying little emotional involvement with Paulina which is somehow not supposed to be sexual. But neither situation feels completely true to life.Clarks wife of course does become suspicious about his behavior and discovers his secret by hiring a private detective. The films resulting confrontation and anti-climax at Chicagos biggest ballroom dance competition -- where Johns secret if finally exposed -- feels embarrassing rather than heartfelt.Fails in comparison Susan Sarandon plays Geres suspicious wife in ""Shall We Dance?""Well perhaps its unfair to compare the American ""Shall We Dance?"" with its Japanese counterpart just as its often unfair to compare a movie with the book its based on.But the film asks for this comparison. For one thing it would have us believe that its cast of cross-cultural misfits is somehow making the same type of rebellious social statement as the dancers in the Japanese film. But that idea falls flat on the dance floor. While fox-trotting your way to inner peace may be an unusual method for many of us thousands of Americans -- unlike the Japanese -- have for years found a sense of fulfillment by having an occasional date with Arthur Murray or Fred Astaire.And then theres the bonding -- shrouded in secrecy -- of the people taking dance lessons. The characters lack the individual depth and -- for that matter -- the deep social bonds of the original film; theyre just misfits. Their relationship is missing the glue needed to make the audience feel their need for deception and therefore their sense of shame of being outside the norm.The performances dont quite work partly due to the script by Audrey Wells (""Under the Tuscan Sun""). Sarandon is great as always but wasnt given much of a character. Lopez looks terrific and her dancings wonderful but her character is an awkward fit; she appears miscast in the role. And Gere wears his million-dollar grin and a little of his ""Chicago"" charisma but that doesnt quite fit the role either.Director Peter Chelsom (""The Mighty"") and screenwriter Wells do ponder other themes but they go nowhere buried under the attempt to transfer the story from one culture to another. Its like placing Cinderellas glass slipper on the foot of one of her stepsisters.""Shall We Dance?"" doesnt work as a remake and it doesnt work on its own. Its missteps turn the delicate footwork of the original into a clunky thud. ""Shall We Dance?"" opens Friday October 15 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Shall We Dance? Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shall-we-dance-2004,200,shallwedance13,shallwedance,rogerebert
"Gere embraces showy side in lively Dance - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Gere embraces showy side in lively Dance By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 15 2004 James Brown is often touted as the hardest-working man in show business which always feels a little unfair. What about the boom operators the stagehands or the Teamsters? What about Richard Gere?To you and me it may seem like the guys had it pretty easy. But hes spent his whole career trying to be taken seriously and the past 15 years of it looking really pained as though the best way to earn respectability is to squint really hard when we all know its to say no to ""Red Corner"" and ""The Mothman Prophecies.""Lately though Gere seems happy to be alive. In ""Chicago"" he made a sleazy joke of his characteristic smugness. He sang danced and let Renee Zellweger sit on his lap too. He had finally come out of the closet as a showman. ""Shall We Dance?"" which opens today finds Gere still light-footed and loving it. He plays the imaginatively named John Clark a Chicago businessman who for reasons he doesnt initially understand enrolls in a ballroom-dance class.The movie is an unnecessary Hollywood overhaul of the warm fuzzy Japanese film that was a pretty big hit over here in 1997. But Gere is a pleasure smiling and spinning and high-fiving his two classmates -- played by Bobby Cannavale and Omar Miller -- and the movie is happy and extremely likable.John has been working the same job for decades. He and his wife (a radiant Susan Sarandon) have made a lovely home and raised their 2.5 kids but around the time of his latest birthday he has a very mild very discreet crisis that seems to be solved by secretly learning the tango and the cha-cha every Wednesday night. It must help that Jennifer Lopez plays one of the instructors.Peter Chelsom directs ""Shall We Dance?"" which was adapted by Audrey Wells (""Under the Tuscan Sun"") to please a crowd and he keeps the nondance moments mostly uncluttered. Wells has a sneakily sophisticated knack for balancing maturity and exuberance. Youre allowed to see how two long-married people start to become invisible to each other after so many years without falling out of love. After all these years the middle-age dog just wants to learn a new trick.Eventually the couples teenage daughter notices that her father is acting weird and informs her mother who hires a private investigator (Richard Jenkins) to spy on him. Nobody said the movie isnt a little silly but its basically an invitation to watch a bunch of movie stars mingle with character actors and enjoy it. Everybody seems to have had a sip of whatever Gere is having although Lopez could have used a little more.Lopez frequently seems caught between her waxen likeness in Madame Tussauds and a truly sad woman. Its as if by holding back and being sweet and classy shes doing us a favor. This is the sort of restraint you wish you could see from her off-screen. But in all fairness Lopez does give her ego a break. Shes so demure and underused you almost forget shes there except that like the great bombshells before her she does glow but only modestly.Just about everybody else in ""Shall We Dance?"" is showy as if they cant believe theyre getting paid for this. (Lopez just seems grateful.) Anita Gillette is wonderful as wistful Miss Mitzi. So are the slyly sexy Jenkins and Lisa Ann Walter as a brassy dancer. Shes like a less polished Bette Midler.Then theres Stanley Tucci playing a co-worker of Johns who annoyingly has to disguise himself as a flamboyant Latino to really cut loose as a dancer. The worry among his peers is that he might be gay -- thats actually the entire worry in ""Shall We Dance?"" that men who dance are less than men that theres shame in exuberance. This is nonsense obviously. And Gere after years of seeming locked inside himself finally seems ready to promote the idea that any star who fears show ought to find a new business.Shall We Dance?

"Shall We Dance? | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shall-we-dance_949 ) Shall We Dance? (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Shall We Dance? is a remake of the 1997 Japanese feature by the same name. Penned and directed by Masayuki Suo that film was an unexpected pleasure - a feel-good feature that wasnt weighed down by the unnecessarily cloying melodrama and manipulation that often accompanies such endeavors. The movie was so beloved amongst art-house goers that Miramax who snapped up the North American rights commissioned a re-make. And to further enhance anticipation of the new version they declined to make the Japanese original available on home video. Now some seven years later we finally get to see how screenwriter Audrey Welles (The Truth About Cats and Dogs) and director Peter Chelsom (Serendipity) see this story unspooling. To say that its not worth the wait is an understatement. It would be unfair to say that Shall We Dance? is a bad or inept motion picture. But the two movies despite having similar storylines do not produce the same reactions. The 2004 edition of the tale is nicely filmed and features a surprisingly nuanced performance from Richard Gere who seems to be losing his woodenness as he gains more gray hair. But Jennifer Lopez is little more than a lifeless mannequin and the entire feature feels poorly motivated and low on energy. Theres clearly something missing. A few lines copied from my review of the original supply the absent piece of the puzzle ""One of the most interesting aspects of the [1997 version] for a Western viewer is that were offered an opportunity to peer through an open window into Japanese society especially as it addresses issues of intimacy. For those of us who are used to the idea that dancing is an integral part of the cultural fabric understanding how the Japanese view this activity can cause a shift in perspective."" Take away the Japanese setting and this element is surgically removed from the story. All thats left in its wake is a quasi-romance about a man struggling through a mid-life crisis. Not exactly groundbreaking material. Gere plays John Clark a workaholic lawyer who seems to be living the American dream. He has a nice home two great kids and a wonderful loving wife named Beverly (Susan Sarandon). So why isnt he happy? One day while traveling home on the El he spies the lonely lovely Paulina (Lopez) staring out the window of a dance studio. Intrigued he decides to sign up for lessons. Soon he is learning all the right moves from the studios owner Miss Mitzy (Anita Gillette) but his eyes always stray to Paulina who is giving private lessons in an adjoining room. As his lessons progress he learns to his surprise that the dancing gives him release and happiness and he agrees to partner with the abrasive Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter) in an upcoming competition. Meanwhile Beverly is convinced that her husband is having an affair and hires a private investigator to uncover the truth. Im willing to give Welles and Chelsom credit for not overly Americanizing the storyline. In staying true to the original Shall We Dance? avoids a romance between John and Paulina. The real love story is John and Beverlys. Unfortunately for this film to work there needs to be more energy between the top-billed pair. In fact Paulina has to be more than an attractive figurehead. Despite fitful attempts (via perfunctory flashbacks) to flesh-out Paulinas character she never attains the status necessary to give her interaction with John meaning. It has been a difficult year-plus for Lopez and this represents the latest misstep/misjudgment. Its hard to believe that the stiff and mechanical actress here is the same one who radiated so much heat and passion in Out of Sight. Dancing is supposed to be a passionate and sensual endeavor. The best screen movies capture the unspoken essence of the interaction between partners. Films like Strictly Ballroom and Tango crackle with electricity. The dance scenes come alive. Such is not the case in Shall We Dance? Here theres a stateless to the numbers. They are in a word boring. Even the antics of Stanley Tucci playing a manic Latin dancer cant liven things up. In choreographing the dance sequences Chelsom shows too much restraint and good taste. As a result the ending although it makes perfect sense and offers closure seems muted and oddly unsatisfying. I walked out of the original Shall We Dance? with a silly grin on my face. I left this one shaking my head wondering where it had all gone wrong. The answer lies in the title of another film about the cultural schism between East and West Lost in Translation. Shall We Dance?

This is an enterprise that all too often ends in tears though not in the frisky hands of Richard Eyre a longtime director of Englands Royal National Theater who crossed into film with the terrific political drama The Ploughmans Lunch (1983) and more recently the 2001 Iris Murdoch weepie Iris. Stage Beauty may have more thematic ambition than is altogether good for it but along with The Madness of King George Shakespeare in Love and Restoration the movie blows a fresh wind of disrespect high drama and lush romanticism through that stolidly middlebrow subgenre the period drama. The known facts about Kynaston are that when the fanatically puritan Oliver Cromwell closed down Englands theaters the fledgling actor forged ahead and received clandestine training in womens roles. When the more liberal if no less philistine King Charles II returned from exile in 1660 Kynaston became a star famous for his portrayal of Desdemona in Othello -- he was written up by no less an observer than Samuel Pepys as ""the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life."" Kynastons sex life was either ambiguous or ambidextrous; he was rumored to have slept with the Duke of Buckingham but ended up marrying a woman named Maria and fathering six children. Eyre lathers this already colorful life into a feisty comic drama about performance the allure of the cross-dresser and the ephemeral cult of celebrity. In some quarters the movie which advances Kynaston as a closet heterosexual will be seen as reactionary. Theres a vague feminist slant too but the film is as much about the intimate connection between an actors life and his art as it is about the politics of gender and to his credit Eyre has sidestepped the temptation to dumb down Kynastons biography into a 17th-century La Cage aux Folles. Not that the movie lacks for burlesque. Billy Crudup who plays Kynaston with just the right balance of excess and restraint is nothing if not a pretty boy. With his delicate bone structure and kewpie-doll lips he makes a pretty girl too. The film opens on the climactic death scene in Othello and Crudups sly rendition of the dying Desdemona is both impish and showily gestural with a hint of simpering contempt for the feminine wiles hovering behind it. Kynastons blend of snarkiness and haunting vulnerability seems only to bring more adoration from his male and female fans blissfully suspended between belief in his female nature and a smutty desire to confirm what they already know lies beneath those skirts. Then as now though careers turned on the forked tongues of powerful insiders (Richard Griffiths a.k.a. Harry Potters nasty Uncle Vernon turns in a wonderfully piggy performance as a conniving blue blood). Lulled into a false sense of security by his popularity and the protection of his titled lover (Ben Chaplin) Kynaston is devastated to discover that his dresser Maria (a very good Claire Danes cannily tempering Crudups flightiness with an earthy practicality) has been hanging on his every word and gesture -- and reproducing them in a fringe theater that has caught the eye of the king (Rupert Everett channeling John Cleese) and his lively mistress Nell Gwyn (Zoe Tapper). Overnight Kynaston is reduced to a has-been. When the repentant Maria herself displaced because she is after all a god-awful performer comes across him sadly parodying himself in a tavern she rescues him and the stage is set for some mutual tutoring in art and life.

Sep. 13 600pm This is a trifle pat but the killing of Desdemona conceals all manner of other more symbolic murders and the scene becomes the movies refrain repeated each time with a significantly different style and emphasis each time marking a sea change not only in Kynastons fortunes but in the philosophy of acting. Eyre has collapsed the transition from gestural to naturalistic performance a process that took several centuries into a few short years which takes some nerve. Still nerve and an excess of aesthetic ambition are what give Stage Beauty its feverish energy. And if all this sounds like a movie that only a theater buff could love its far from it. Eyre chases mood up and down the scale beautifully from saucy to tragic to heartfelt. Stage Beauty is about the loss and recovery not only of an actors career but of his whole identity. Its about the creative exchange between a man imprisoned in his role both as actor and as male and a would-be actress imprisoned in imitation.   By the time the final scene of Othello is played out for the last time Maria has become an actress and a lover and Ned Kynaston has closed the gap between the actor and the man. I dont quite buy the therapeutic make-over but the movie is bags of fun to watch.   If Stage Beauty is about an artist transformed by love Shall We Dance? is about an ordinary man who reaches for art in order to find love and finds himself transformed by art or at least ballroom dancing. Or it would be if it werent such a lump of lead. The 1996 Japanese movie on which its based directed by Masayuki Suo was a little inert for my taste but it had a goofy downbeat charm and I could see why it swept the box office in Japan -- its about a man breaking out of rigid conformity. And Id have thought someone with the mettle of Peter Chelsom a Brit who counts among his critical successes Funny Bones The Mighty and the delightful light-opera hit Hear My Song could have made a tight little American romp or a quiet chamber piece out of a resonant universal theme the incompleteness of the ordinary life. Instead Shall We Dance? which roams all over the emotional map without landing anywhere is an unwieldy mess that gives every impression of having been made under a mandate to fill the Miramax crowd-pleaser slot. Armed with a handsome Weinstein budget Chelsom has some serious star wattage at his disposal and that turns out to be the problem. I cant think of two actors less suited separately or together to play nice but troubled Everymen than Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. With his unaccountably sexy snaggleteeth and the famous gigolo twinkle in his beady eyes Gere was not made for nice. He was made for sin and deceit and in Shall We Dance? he looks almost embarrassed to be playing John Clark a preternaturally good-natured Chicago lawyer whos happily married to no less a beauty than Susan Sarandon yet trudges through life bowed by a discontent he cant articulate. One night he glances up from his commuter train and sees a sad beautiful face (J.Lo) gazing out of the window of a seedy dance studio. With uncharacteristic impulsiveness John jumps out and signs up for classes along with several other apparent losers as klutzy as he is. Soon hes learning to put a spring in his tango but not alas from the sad woman a ballroom champion who for unspecified reasons has lost her partner and lover and remains out of reach. Lopez who was born to be vibrant sexy and sassy and can even manage quietly luminous when pushed (she was irresistible in Out of Sight) spends most of the movie frozen into a wince that suggests a hurt more gastrointestinal than romantic. Only at the end when she cheers up and steps out for a paso doble do her natural radiance and her magnificent butt show up for duty. Too little too late. By this time Shall We Dance? has gone right where you expect it to -- straight to sitcom. With its de facto family of schlubs propping one another up through bad times and good the movie shows its true colors Its Friends plus gaudy frocks. The dismally pedestrian script is by Audrey Wells -- one mourns for the crisp talent that wrote The Truth About Cats amp; Dogs and Guinevere. Though its meant to move as well as entertain the film lacks the tonal nuance that in the Japanese version warmed audiences to the struggle of this docile inexpressive man to find a way out of the daily grind. Sailing grimly toward a sewn-up sugary finale Chelsom ups the ante of his broad burlesque until it smothers whatever might be touching about this bunch as they struggle to redefine their identities. The ending is as comfortable as an old shoe and -- aside from a couple of nice dance sequences -- about as exciting. Only Stanley Tucci mincing manfully in a scary wig as Johns co-worker and closet ballroom champ and a very funny Lisa Ann Walter rising above a thankless Bette Midler role seem to understand that the only way to go with all this enforced zaniness is to drive it straight off a cliff.

But it also nicely fleshes out the protagonists family life resulting in an unabashedly old-fashioned entertainment loaded with traditional dancing and music that should connect agreeably and profitably with older audiences as well as fans of the dancing Richard Gere of ""Chicago."" Writer-director Masayuki Suos sincere slow-burning charmer which Miramax nursed to a brawny 9.5 million Stateside gross in 1997 pirouetted on the amusingly and affectingly awkward attempts of a shy accountant in a conformist society to break out of his emotional straitjacket through dance. In an American context without the trappings of tradition and reticence of its original setting story loses the source of some of its comedy and repressed feeling. And while the smooth dancing of the second half eventually persuades one to set aside objections suffice it to say Gere is not the first actor who comes to mind to embody a straitlaced man frustrated by a life of walking the straight and narrow. Something else the film has lost in translation at least onscreen is its titular question mark. Filmmakers reportedly decided the title derived from Rodgers amp; Hammersteins immortal tune from ""The King and I"" looked better in non-querying form while the marketing department differed deciding to retain the notation for print ads. As minimally but adroitly recalibrated by scripter Audrey Wells story offers Gere as John Clark a Windy City attorney specializing in wills and estates who outwardly has it all -- lovely old suburban house attractive wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) and two teenage kids only one of whom exhibits even slightly obnoxious traits. In fact John is a virtual double for the husband Gere played a couple of years back in ""Unfaithful"" only here hes the one with the wandering eye. On his evening ride home on the El John keeps noticing a beautiful woman sadly looking out from the second-story window of Miss Mitzis Ballroom Dance School. Curiosity getting the better of him he eventually gathers the nerve to head up the stairs to try to meet the gazing lady. John summarily finds himself enrolled in the Wednesday evening beginners class taught by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette) a sweet old tippler who puts John through his stumbling initial paces along with the hulking Vern (Omar Miller) and slick Chic (Bobby Cannavale) who protests rather too much about his straight credentials. The object of Johns interests Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) holds herself aloof from the beginners and is rumored to be recovering from a personal and professional rejection by her dance partner after the world competition in Blackpool the year before. Enlivening the light comedy of the early going are Lisa Ann Walter in what could be called the Jennifer Coolidge part of Bobbie an overweight and smart-mouthed hoofer looking for the right partner and Stanley Tucci as Link a bald and put-upon office colleague of Johns who morphs into a dance-floor freak upon donning a Moe Howard wig and ""Disco Inferno"" outfits. Jumping to the conclusion that her frequently late or absent husband is having an affair the distracted Beverly hires detective Devine (Richard Jenkins) to follow him which makes for a few lightweight shenanigans but reveals nothing untoward where Johns behavior is concerned. After John and Paulina finally have a chance to dance together and talk she warns him in no uncertain terms not to entertain any romantic notions about her. Its significantly harder here than it was in the Japanese edition to believe John simply cant bring himself to tell his wife what hes doing with his time or that Beverly simply wont confront him with the question. But such details are swept aside once the tale enters competition mode with the now improved students preparing for the novice title at an upcoming city contest. This stretch is dominated by lavish dance numbers that prove breezily diverting and never overstay their welcome. Most significant contribution by screenwriter Wells is an elaboration of Beverlys reaction to her eventual discovery of Johns secret and the way the couple maturely use lessons learned to strengthen their own relationship. Concluding scenes one of which contains a strong echo of Geres film-clinching climactic gesture in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" may be hokey but on the pictures terms they give the storys journey a raison detre it didnt have in Japan. Wrap-up overview of the various characters fates works a particularly novel variation on the usual informational printouts. Director Peter Chelsom gives the material everything it needs in terms of pizzazz and heart. Its shamelessly direct in its emotional targeting but in a gentle inoffensive way that will appeal to viewers who prefer the old storytelling formulas to the more sensationalistic contemporary approach. Even divested of his sometime smug mannerisms Gere remains too physically out-of-the-ordinary and confident for this Average Joe character but he comes into his own in the latter going when John acquires the terpsichorean chops to put on a good show. Similarly arresting in her dance numbers Lopez is perfectly plausible as a remote object of desire but less so as a woman deeply scarred by romantic misfortune. Sarandons deer-in-the-headlights reactions to the narratives revelations makes the character a tad too out-to-lunch. Raft of supporting players from Tucci and Walter to Miller Cannavale and Nick Cannon as a junior detective offers broad comic relief. Production designer Caroline Hanania and lenser John de Borman make the heavily art-directed dance studio into a warmly lit womb that becomes a safe haven for the secret lives of the students. Musical elements are vibrant and varied with Gabriel Yareds ""English Patient""-like romantic theme offset by a host of familiar standards ethnic dance tunes and covers executed in an assortment of styles.
