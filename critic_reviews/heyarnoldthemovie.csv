""Hey Arnold The Movie"" represents the latest transformation of a hit toon series from cable network Nickelodeon into a feature kidpic ripe for franchising. And like its two ""Rugrats"" predecessors pic has surprising hipness and good humor to spare all put across with a funky low-tech vibe. Still this is a minor effort in both content and form by todays animation standards and its rough edges may be a bit too rough to attract a ""Rugrats""-size stampede at the box office. But pic has lots of charm and parents in attendance wont feel too bored or alienated by its goings-on while kids will lap it up. With a June 28 opening slated (counterprogrammed against Sonys Adam Sandler starrer ""Mr. Deeds"") niche biz looks promising for this perhaps youngest-skewing of the major-studio summer releases. A late addition to the family sidebar at the inaugural Tribeca Film Festival pic proves an appropriate choice; though set in an unnamed metropolis ""Hey Arnold"" gives off a distinctly Gotham feel. Its city features crowded brownstones and rail transportation while the working-class multiethnic block where most of the action takes place vividly recalls Spike Lees Brooklyn. Everything is a little topsy-turvy in the ""Hey Arnold"" universe beginning with its eponymous protagonist (voiced by Spencer Klein) whose elongated head suggests a flattened-out football and who lives (for reasons unexplained) with his borderline-senile grandparents in a ramshackle dormitory. Other key players are Arnolds best friend Gerald (Jamil Walker Smith) and his semi-arch-nemesis Helga (Francesca Marie Smith) who secretly loves Arnold but cloaks her infatuation in hate. Action centers around a maniacal land developer named Scheck has decided to bulldoze and redevelop Arnolds neighborhood. Arnold and his neighbors exhaust official channels in their quest to halt the impending demolition going so far as to stage a free outdoor concert -- called Blockapalooza -- that accomplishes nothing. So Arnold and Gerald (with a little surreptitious help from Helga) take matters into their own hands embarking on a heroic odyssey through the city during which they cross paths with such colorful characters as a Bond Girl-esque spy voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh and a ghostly city coroner voiced by Christopher Lloyd. Theres definitely an odd grimness permeating the surface of ""Hey Arnold"" but it works. Pic has a genuine interest in engaging childrens imaginations and understands a certain amount of dark goes well with the light. Its not as twisted as say Roald Dahl but its undeniably smart and appealing in its depiction of everyday superheroes rallying behind a noble cause. The acidic qualities nicely counterbalance the saccharine and though theres the hint of polemics -- a civics lesson from the anti-gentrification brigade -- the film never gets too high-minded. Theres genuine affection here for the virtues of neighborhood color preserved. The animation though hand-drawn has an exaggerated flatness that gives ""Hey Arnold"" an engaging look that seems to grow organically out of its characters quirky tics and moods. They pop out literally and figuratively from the traditional toon landscape. Pic is peppered with amusing sly references to a disparate array of Hollywood blockbusters from ""Men in Black"" to ""All the Presidents Men.""

Comments Hey Arnold The Movie The big-screen debut (2002) of the big-eared football-headed character and his gang from the Nickelodeon cartoon series. Arnold is a resourceful remarkably cool grade-schooler who lives on a multigenerational ethnically mixed city block--a quaint neighborhood thats about to be demolished by an evil developer (voice of Paul Sorvino) who wants to build a megamall. The script includes a civics lesson--grassroots movements and tight-knit communities are good--and its punctuated by action sequences borrowed from hit movies like Speed. The simplistic drawing is closer to Peanuts than The Lion King and the dialogue is strangely anachronistic. Even stranger is the portrayal of Helga Arnolds nemesis as a neurotic stalker. Directed by Tuck Tucker; with the voices of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Lloyd. 76 min.

But the ethical independent-minded kid has his unhip charms and so does ""Hey Arnold The Movie"" the inevitable feature-length adventure based on the animated cartoon created by Craig Bartlett and directed by Tuck Tucker with serviceable bounce. The movie expands on the series liberal and genial worldview (set in a funky out-of-time New York neighborhood) pitting Arnold and his posse as political activists who save the nabe from bulldozing in the name of heartless corporate conquest. (Paul Sorvino gives silky voice to evil plutocrat Mr. Scheck.) Darn if the ingenious kids dont organize and overcome too - a plucky bit of ""Cradle Will Rock"" activism smuggled in under the cover of Nickelodeon smiles.

"Hey Arnold Cartoonish In the Worst Way washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Hey Arnold Cartoonish In the Worst Way Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 28 2002 BASED ON the animated Nickelodeon TV series about a weirdly optimistic inner-city kid with a football-shaped head and a Flock of Seagulls hairdo ""Hey Arnold The Movie"" plays more like agitprop than childrens entertainment. Its a disturbingly pro-violent-resistance screed against gentrification that masquerades as a harmlessly uplifting toon. First a little background. Arnold (voiced by Spencer Klein) lives with his grandparents in a preternaturally diverse urban ghetto straight out of Central Casting. Although overwhelmingly white the neighborhood boasts a token Southeast Asian one Eastern European a couple of blacks and a Jew or two nearly all of whom get along fabulously. Needless to say the village idiot has a heavy Southern accent and the crook is an Italian named Vermicelli. When an evil developer named Scheck (Paul Sorvino doing an obvious Ronald Reagan vocal impression) tries to buy up the neighborhood to build a mall Arnold and his best friend Gerald (Jamil Smith) try to organize the citizenry in opposition. After a couple of futile attempts to fight the power through legal means (e.g. a block party) it comes to Arnolds attention that the street may have historic preservation status and he and Gerald are forced to resort to breaking and entering to unearth the documents that can stave off the demolition. Meanwhile Grandpa (Dan Castellaneta) has wired the street with a couple of hundred pounds of dynamite as an alternate form of persuasion. I know I know. Im taking a cartoon waaay too seriously but Im not used to having such a radicalized vision of political correctness shoved down my throat as family entertainment. And this is coming from someone who voted for Ralph Nader and who lives in Columbia Heights one of the most legitimately diverse neighborhoods in Washington (not to mention the focus of its own real-life debate on gentrification). So maybe Im a little sensitive. Polemics aside ""Hey Arnold"" is just not very watchable. Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well drawn the film is populated with such majorly dysfunctional characters as Helga (Francesca Smith) Arnolds preteen neighbor who cant seem to make up her mind whether shes the heros tormentor or love interest. ""My God what a humorless blowhole"" youre probably saying to yourselves right about now. I only hope youre talking about the movie and not me.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Hey Arnold The Movie RATING (Polite Applause) Cartoon comedy. Voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by Tuck Tucker. (G. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) And you thought Charlie Brown had a weird head. The platter-faced mug of Arnold star of ""Hey Arnold The Movie"" is topped by twin geysers of blond shock-locks divided by a teeny tiny blue baseball cap. And no to your next question he is not wearing a kilt. Thats a red plaid shirt untucked hanging out under his sweater. On the other hand if this is news you are obviously not in fourth grade. ""Hey Arnold"" has been an animated Nickelodeon sensation since its premiere in 1996 watched by 45 million kids (and their parents) a month. This movie takes Arnold and his scruffy neighborhood with a heart to the big screen. Arnold and his offbeat pals exist in the same parallel universe as their Nickelodeon first cousins ""Rugrats."" Parents are goofy and ineffectual and mostly around for comic relief. Kids are wise tolerant and almost entirely without supervision. Problems crop up -- which adults either misunderstand or find so overwhelming that they give up immediately -- and it is left to the young heroes to save the day. They do so generally after learning a valuable (and politically correct) lesson. Arnold who lives in a boardinghouse with his grandparents is the conscience of the gang nudging his pals to do the right if sometimes painful thing. Thats why they respect him even if they do call him ""Football Head."" Although no dedicated ""Hey Arnold"" fan will buy the premise of the big crisis -- ""You knew they werent going to tear down the neighborhood"" said our fifth-grade demographic representative -- it is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters. Parents will also enjoy picking out the sly movie references from ""Shawshank Redemption"" to ""Casablanca"" to ""Men in Black"" with stops at ""Speed"" and ""Mission Impossible."" They also may wish Christopher Lloyds (""Back to the Future"") batty character had more lines. One quibble. Despite an obvious commitment to diversity -- a bus driver for example is a disabled vet -- there arent many girl characters. However devoted fans will want to know that Helga Arnolds powerhouse rival finally fesses up and says the ""L-word"" to Arnold. Hey in the neighborhood thats the biggest news since Stinky and Sid mooned Principal Wartz. -- C.W. Nevius THE EMPERORS NEW CLOTHES Historical fantasy. Starring Ian Holm and Iben Hjejle. Directed by Alan Taylor. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) While watching Ian Holm in this charming historical fantasy it occurred to me that this actor has perfectly nailed Napoleons famous way of walking. Then I remembered -- Ive never seen Napoleon walking. There are no Napoleonic newsreels. Theres only a Napoleonic tradition in movies -- one that this new film has fun with. Based on ""The Death of Napoleon"" a novel by Simon Leys ""The Emperors New Clothes"" offers an alternative version of history. What if Napoleon had escaped from exile on St. Helena? What if he had found a double to take his place on the island and made his way to Paris? The result is a genre-bending yarn an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans. Holm has a dual role. He plays the emperor stern and strutting and he also plays his double a lowly deckhand who finds exile on St. Helena to be a cozy vacation. He cant get enough of lying around all day eating English cuisine. Meanwhile Napoleon is struggling toiling on a ship and later doing everything he can to slip unnoticed into France -- everything that is except part his hair on the side. It has been said that the diminutive emperor had a way of looking down at people even as he looked up at them. Holm who is the right height for the role also has the authoritative bearing the steely eyes the aura of unshakable resolve. His is a decidedly Anglo Napoleon however Theres no perfumed handkerchief or pretense of delicacy in this performance. This is a soldier whos been in jail for six years. In his few scenes as the faux Napoleon Holm shows us the mechanics of a Napoleonic performance as he assumes the walk and assumes the airs. Hes very funny. The Danish actress Iben Hjejle brings a warm quality to the role of Pumpkin a melon merchant who falls in love with Napoleon while hes incognito -- and becomes concerned when he develops signs of that age-old delusion He thinks hes Napoleon. Advisory This film has strong language. -- Mick LaSalle CINEMA PARADISO THE NEW VERSION Drama. Starring Philippe Noiret Jacques Perrin and Agnese Nano. Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. (R. 172 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Go figure The old version of ""Cinema Paradiso"" which won the best foreign film Oscar for 1989 was a masterpiece. But this directors cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera. Even the most ardent fan of Giuseppe Tornatore will not be able to help noticing that this gifted director has screwed up a beautiful thing. The restored minutes which were cut before the films successful premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989 throw off the movies balance alter relationships and add plodding details. ""Cinema Paradiso The New Version"" is of interest only in that it shows the ungainly hunk of marble from which Tornatore carved his delicate classic. The movie is presented as a memory piece. Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) an internationally lauded film director looks back on his childhood in postwar Sicily where his life revolved around the local movie house the Paradiso. We meet Salvatore as a child; then we see him in adolescence experiencing first love with a local girl named Elena (Agnese Nano). Later we see him in his early 50s returning home after many years to attend the funeral of the gruff old projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) a father figure whose counsel changed his life. The marvel of the original ""Cinema Paradiso"" was the sense of nostalgia the 32-year-old Tornatore was able to bring to the piece. It seemed the work of an older or at least middle-aged man. But the ""New Version"" is naive in ways that make it seem very much a young mans movie. Most of the restored footage can be found in the last section which now feels like a film in itself. It tells the far-fetched story of how Salvatore has been pining for his first sweetheart all his life. The movie wants us to believe that he has wasted the past 30 years unable to make a meaningful connection with any woman because one girl left him. In the original movie the most important relationship was that of the boy and Alfredo. ""The New Version"" makes Elena the pivotal person in his life and we dont buy it. Something heartfelt becomes something almost silly and the movie barely survives. Advisory This film contains sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 Woman at scene of minor crash killed when car hits her Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Officials believe no survivors in Texas hot air balloon crash Little shake 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Bay Area Philippine president calls off truce after rebel attack Ann Coulter slammed for calling war heros dad angry Muslim 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

"USATODAY.com - Nickelodeon cartoon Hey Arnold hits big screens Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/28/2002 - Updated 1235 AM ET Nickelodeon cartoon Hey Arnold hits big screens By Claudia Puig USA TODAY AP Gerald and Arnold in Hey Arnold The Movie. Following in the grand cinematic tradition of Mr. Smith Norma Rae and Erin Brockovich is ... the football-headed Arnold? Everybody loves the story of the little guy up against the corporate giant and here the 9-year-old crusader literally fits the bill. Most adults have given up on causes but when his neighborhood is threatened to be plowed under by Future Tech Industries Arnold (voice of Spencer Klein) must act. He and pal Gerald (Jamil Smith) set out to stop evil Mr. Scheck from turning their neighborhood into a giant shopping mall. Read more below Video View the trailer to Hey Arnold The Movie One of Schecks mantras is ""out with the old and in with the new"" but kids will see through that and understand the true message the value of continuity tradition and community. Some parents might even get a kick out of how much the megalomaniacal Scheck sounds like Ronald Reagan (Paul Sorvino). Arnold is assisted in his efforts to uncover a scandal within Future Tech by Deep Voice a mysterious figure in a dark fedora and trench coat whos really the pig-tailed Helga (Francesca Smith). She has a powerful crush on the oblivious Arnold but pretends to hate him. (She builds shrines to him in her spare time.) Arnold amp; Co.s clever efforts naturally save the neighborhood. But the movie feels like a long-form version of the popular Nickelodeon cartoon series on which its based which probably wont bother Arnold fans.
