Such as do all Army vets wax their chests as diligently as Chris Vaughn (The Rock)? Why dont bad guys bleed after being mashed about the head with a two-by-four? And shouldnt more A-listers follow The Rocks lead and boil down their name to reflect their salient points (Hugh Grant Adam Sandler and Tom Cruise as The Brit The Shit and The Squit for starters)? Of course you could also explore the political parallels of a plot in which a dumbass thug sheriff (The Rock) unilaterally decides to clean up a town on the skids by beating the crappola out of perceived foes because he a) thinks they might be bad; b) just plain doesnt like them. However nothing screams smartass more than foggy metaphors drawn from ropey action flicks so best settle back with your popcorn and be grateful that the whole damn farrago will be over about 85 minutes after it begins. You dont get much bang for your buck these days do you?

"Walking Tall | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; walking-tall ) Walking Tall (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Rocks on a roll. Anyone who doubts Dwayne Johnson can be the new millenniums answer to Arnold needs to look no further than his recent resume. The parallels are astonishing. Both come from non-acting fields where brawn is a key requisite. Both have a strong screen presence coupled with a limited acting range. And both are savvy about the importance of marketing and branding to stardom. The only thing The Rock lacks is an accent (for example he correctly pronounces ""California""); however since he is American-born the Presidency isnt out of the question. And which would you rather have inside the White House (as well as on its grounds) a bush or a rock? Especially early in his career Arnold made his share of stinkers. (Anyone remember Red Sonja Commando and Raw Deal?) Walking Tall stands up as The Rocks first venture into cinematic putrefaction. (The Scorpion King wasnt awful it was just plain silly.) This is a wretched motion picture even considering that it isnt a member of a well-respected genre. The film is comprised of four violent action scenes tied together by nearly 50 minutes of alternately hilarious (unintentionally of course) and dull filler. So we have the obligatory character-building scenes not to mention an underdeveloped romance that serves no discernable purpose whatsoever. (Since this is a PG-13 movie its not even an excuse for a hot sex scene.) The original Walking Tall which is 30 years old features Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser and strays pretty far from the basic facts of the crusading sheriffs life. (Bo Svenson took over the part in a sequel and a short-lived TV series). Its not a great film but there is some entertainment value associated with it - more than can be said of the remake. The 2004 version takes the story further from its ""inspiration"" even renaming the protagonist as Chris Vaughn. One wonders why the filmmakers bothered with the obligatory ""Inspired by Real Events"" caption. This interpretation of a Southern sheriff is closer to Paul Bunyan or Mighty Casey than Buford Pusser. Chris Vaughn (The Rock) is a Special Ops vet who has returned to his backwater hometown in hopes of working in the local sawmill. (Every mans dream - go home and cut up lumber.) Unfortunately it has been closed. The towns lone source of income is now a casino run by one of Chris high-school pals Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough). It doesnt take long before Chris and Jay are opposing one another since Jay doesnt play nice in a friendly game of football while Chris does. Chris first steps to clean up the town meet with failure. He is beaten and left for dead then is subsequently arrested after taking a big stick to some slot machines and goons in Jays employ. Obviously a fan of ""Law and Order"" he successfully defends himself in court then runs for sheriff and wins. Thats when the conflict heats up. Casting has been done wisely. The filmmakers have chosen a group of mostly-anonymous actors whose performances are so inept that theyre unlikely to outshine the ex-rassler star. Neal McDonough is just what youd expect from a generic bad guy - he does a lot of sneering and utters countless dire predictions about the protagonists fate. Ashley Scott is just what youd expect from a generic girlfriend - she has a nice body an acceptable face and almost no dialogue. (Considering some of the lines the other actors are forced to speak thats probably a blessing.) As for chemistry between Scott and The Rocka| Lets just say that the ""Survivor"" castaways are more adept at generating sparks. With a movie like this its pointless to complain about the lame dialogue poor acting and plot-by-numbers script. People who see this movie if they see it will do so because they want to watch The Rock kick ass. Thats essentially what he does although the approach is so workmanlike that theres nothing fun in the experience. Instead of generating a testosterone rush the fight scenes release tryptophan. Not only are they boring but they are choreographed in an amateurish fashion by director Kevin Bray who makes the film look like it was composed on the cheap. And because the action scenes are underwhelming and Walking Tall doesnt have another leg to stand on it falls down.

The Rock plays Chris who takes to wrecking bad guys property in the remake of amp;quo;Walking Tall.amp;quo; Careful with that big stick there mister 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Walking Tall Action drama. Starring The Rock and Neal McDonough. Directed by Kevin Bray. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Walking Tall"" is a remake of an earlier movie based on a true story except that this time the story is entirely fictional. The title is the same as the original 1973 film but virtually everything else has been changed including the location the characters the circumstances the protagonists name and the time period. Only one thing remains the image of a big guy carrying a big stick. This time the big guy is The Rock who once again shows himself to be an estimable action lead with a convincing inner calm a natural good-guy demeanor and the look of a man who can do serious damage. The movie itself is just a routine showcase modest in its aspiration and effective within its limits entertaining in the moment but in the end faintly silly. On the plus side its only 86 minutes long. Nobody tried to pump this one up by pretending its more important than it is. Buford Pusser was the name of the real-life Southern sheriff whose life formed the basis of the 1973 ""Walking Tall"" starring Joe Don Baker. This time the setting is Washington state and the hero is Chris (The Rock) an Army Special Forces guy who returns home after eight years only to find his hometown transformed. Old revered businesses are boarded up while adult book stores are thriving. Everything is gray and threadbare and even the sun doesnt shine. The old mill the basis of the local economy is history and now the only game in town is a sleazy casino. The situation is pure formula rather like a western or like Henry Fondas coming home from prison at the start of ""The Grapes of Wrath."" But in the early moments theres something satisfying in seeing formula done competently. Walking into his seedy hometown Chris meets the new sheriff (Michael Bowen) whos effusive and friendly but we know right away that something isnt right. Chris acts reserved toward him. Obviously the sheriff is bad news because Chris dislikes him on sight. Its skillful when a movie can make an audience feel that the hero is reading a mans character rather than that the filmmakers are telegraphing information. But the sheriff is just a minion. The real head of the town is Jay the man who closed down the old mill and started the casino. As Jay Neal McDonough has the right look a slick veneer bleached blond hair and a lean dapper look and he brings more to this villains role than can be found in the script. He gives him an extra something behind the eyes. McDonough lets us see that Jay once friends with Chris admires his former friends authenticity. Jay is all facade cool by force of will and self-control while Chris is just himself. Its the running undercurrent throughout ""Walking Tall"" and the closest this movie comes to complexity Jay is seeking Chris admiration. But ""Walking Tall"" descends into the ridiculous fairly quickly. Early in the movie on Jays invitation Chris visits the casino where he finds out that one of the crap games is rigged. Does he tell Jay to straighten out the situation? No that would be too easy. Instead he demolishes the place. Of course its just possible that the whole point of The Rock as movie star is the vicarious thrill of watching him wreck property. The original ""Walking Tall"" was propelled by moral indignation as well as a pervasive fear of encroaching social instability. Here the moral indignation is just a pretense. The movie doesnt care about Chris town and the audience doesnt either. The kick here is dumb and visceral. Its in the fun of seeing The Rock slowly get out of a car carrying a block of cedar. Its in waiting for someone to get stupid enough to make him angry. -- Advisory This film contains mild sexual situations and violence.

"The Rock triumphs but Tall falls short - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Rock triumphs but Tall falls short By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 2 2004 In ""Walking Tall"" the Rock is cross-checked stun-gunned knifed up and left for dead on the side of a rainy highway his long pretty face smashed up pretty good. But ladies and gentlemen you neednt worry. Its another day at the office for the professional wrestler turned actor who was born Dwayne Johnson and who could have made this suspenseless action drama from his Jacuzzi.Johnson is fun to watch in movies. As demonstrated here and in last falls ""The Rundown"" hes big without seeming monstrous and can be serious without ever looking bored. The latter is a triumph of acting and feeling given how monotonously by-the-numbers ""Walking Tall"" often is.Johnson is Chris Vaughn a soldier returned to his interracial family in his small unspecified hometown after eight years away as a Special Forces operative in an unspecified war. An old buddy named Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) has closed down the old mill and opened a casino where most of the town works or plays. On one outing Chris tries to get the craps dealer to admit the places dice are loaded. Security is called and things get predictably violent. Chris winds up hospitalized and tries telling the police what happened but they dont seem interested in getting to the bottom of who messed him up. So he heads over to the casino breaks some arms and a few slot machines with a two-by-four and is promptly locked up and put on trial where he acts as his own lawyer.As it turns out his court appearance is a bid to announce his candidacy for sheriff. His closing argument doubles as a rousing stump speech. As sheriff he tries to shut Jays casino down while romancing one of its strippers a blonde from his past (Ashley Scott). Oh and he has to clean up the crystal meth ring (also courtesy of Jay) that has his little nephew (Khleo Thomas) strung out. To ensure that folks who like different kinds of horseplay (rambunctious self-injuring pranks or professional wrestling) buy a ticket Johnny Knoxville late of ""Jackass"" is tapped to play Johnsons shifty deputy Ray.""Walking Tall"" is a remake of the 1973 movie of the same name in which Joe Don Baker plays Buford Pusser the real-life law enforcement legend who cleaned up an entire Tennessee town with reluctant brute force -- and a big stick. It was released amid the flood of social justice flicks that emerged during that period in which the wilting Western was repotted in the vibrant soil of Americas cities and burgs. This remake directed by Kevin Bray replaces the originals rugged vigilantism with less urgent ""Smackdown"" fantasia.This isnt to say Johnson doesnt make the most of each assault. He hurts people with smooth dancerly finesse. He wields that two-by-four the way Fred Astaire twirled a cane. Theres something transporting in how both men interrupt a narrative to snap a neck or tap a toe respectively.But beyond Johnson and his Rockness ""Walking Tall"" which is credited to four different writers is wanting for a reason to be. The other Vaughns seem like extras at their own dinner table. And the movie lacks both a sense of place -- the original was redolent of the South -- and a sense of sin; the 73 version had its share of sad wearied whores. Pusser had a standard of living to restore. Theres so little meaningful vice in this faceless anytown that Vaughn seems like hes just doing a screen test for taking on real blight.

This my friends is what happens when you shave your chest with a dull blade. MGM So here we go with a new and smaller version asThe Rock gives heads a roll whenever the chunk of wood he swings hits the sweet spot of nose cartilage. If nothing else this Rock-y remake is a table-setter for baseball season. (Related video See a clip from Walking Tall) Emanating from of all places Bing Crosby Productions the 1973 Walking Tallcommemorated the vice-expunging exploits of the late Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser who cleaned up his hometown clip joints by dirtying up their employees in myriad altercations. The story here is in many ways the same but the locale is now small-town Washington state. (Related itemTalk to Dwana Pusser live on Wed. April 7 at 1 pm ET. Her father Sheriff Pusser is the legendary lawman upon which the Walking Tall movies were based.) And though the movie is dedicated to Pusser it changes the heros moniker which any male country singer would covet to the blander ""Chris Vaughn."" ABOUT THE MOVIE Walking Tall   (out of four) Stars The Rock Johnny Knoxville Neal McDonough Kristen Wilson Ashley Scott Director Kevin Bray Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense violence sexual content drug material and language Opens Friday nationwide The Rocks acting remains on the bland side as well. But if the movie has one virtue its a kind of surface vitality that results from director Kevin Brays speed-at-all-costs approach. If you skip the end credits the new Walking Tall lasts just an hour and a quarter; the original clocks in at just over two. And Bray has to throw in a touch football game to fill out the running time. But the trade-off results in some pretty paltry characterizations. The stock casino-owner villain (Neal McDonough) exists only to convey smarmily repressed rage whenever Vaughn his onetime high school rival smashes a few dozen more slot machines. Johnny Knoxville (Jackass) has zilch to work with but is OK as The Rocks sidekick. And the love interest (Kristen Wilson first seen in unlikely casino peep-show apparel) doesnt get much time to love. This is because after a short warm-up the movie gets fracas-heavy. And it becomes especially so after casino drug dealers nearly kill now-Sheriff Vaughns nephew with crystal meth. Even Wilson gets involved in the artillery during an attack on the sheriffs office -- led by the ex-sheriff a nice ludicrous touch. Seeing a looker in bra and jeans packing heat is not likely to put off the movies intended demographic nor will its jocular approach to trashing half of the casts civil liberties. The Walking Tall franchise was so popular in its day that it led to a short-lived TV spinoff in 1981. Though theres something mildly disarming about a movie this unpretentious a few more like it might end up turning The Rock into a TV actor.

Loosely based on the life of Tennessee lawman Buford Hayes Pusser this version moves along at a good clip and provides a terrific action leading role for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. But pic will likely do most of its business in video stores and other ancillary venues. The benefits of maintaining good posture and carrying a big stick are explored again in ""Walking Tall"" a remake of Phil Karlsons enormously successful 1973 ""hixploitation"" pic that spawned two theatrical sequels one TV movie and a short-lived series. Loosely based like its predecessors on the life of legendary Tennessee lawman Buford Hayes Pusser this new version moves along at a good clip and provides a terrific action leading role for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. But pic will likely do most of its business in video stores and other ancillary venues. Having renamed its protag Chris Vaughn and transplanted him in rural Washington State -- pic was lensed in British Columbia -- the films setup otherwise closely parallels the original. Returning for the first time since he left to pursue a career in Army special forces hometown boy Vaughn (The Rock) is happily reunited with his father (John Beasley) mother (Barbara Tarbuck) sister (Michelle Wilson) and teenage nephew (Khleo Thomas). But he soon discovers that things around town have changed quite a bit and not for the better. A local mill -- once the communitys economic center -- has been shuttered and pretty much the only game in town now is a casino/strip club run by Vaughns former high school rival Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough). Vaughns ex-girlfriend (Ashley Scott) performs in a peep show there. Whats worse is that the already sin-infested casino is also crooked which Vaughn discovers when (in a memorable scene duplicated from the 1973 pic) he spots a craps table substituting rigged dice for the real deal. A huge brawl erupts and when its over Vaughn is charged with inciting the incident. He pleads his case directly to the jury and promises if hes acquitted hell run for sheriff and clean up the town. From there on out its payback time. Helping Vaughn is his recently deputized childhood friend Ray (Johnny Knoxville with such comic panache that you wish hed been given more to do). Like ""Billy Jack"" just before it and ""Death Wish"" right afterward the original ""Walking Tall"" arrived at a moment when Americans in the throes of high crime rates and even higher inflation were perfectly primed for stories about the loss of security and the decay of small-town American values. Similarly its not hard to see this remake (and the other vigilante pics on tap for this year) as a response to the current climate of fear concerning economic recession acts of terrorism et al. Scribes David Klass Channing Gibson David Levien and Brian Koppelman (working from Mort Briskins original script) make it clear that Vaughn would be only slightly less upset about the presence of a casino in his town were it a perfectly legit enterprise. When he isnt out pursuing Hamilton Vaughn purges the town of its on-the-take deputies and unconscionable drug dealers. Pic makes a particularly strong and potentially controversial argument for the right to bear arms depicting Vaughns father (well played by Beasley) as a gun owner-turned-pacifist who is nonetheless forced to arm himself when the going gets rough. In the first pic hes had to carry more or less single-handedly minus the presence of elaborate visual effects (""The Scorpion King"") or an expansive supporting cast (""The Rundown"") the Rock acquits himself very nicely. He effuses that confident swagger of the best action-movie leads. Yet in spite of his huge stature theres something vulnerable about him. Directing his second feature (after 2002s Ice Cube starrer ""All About the Benjamins"") musicvid helmer Kevin Bray makes an admirable stab at rooting the story in human drama rather than just producing one action set piece after another. But instead of giving the movie some kick Brays action -- when it does come -- is unimpressively staged shot in too-tight closeups and sloppily cut. After the believable hand-to-hand combat used throughout the over-the-top climax has Vaughn navigate his way through thousands of rounds of semiautomatic gunfire. By the end ""Walking Tall"" has all but lost its human touch. Also despite pics major-studio packaging Bray largely proceeds as though he were tailoring the film to the drive-in cinemas that were already on the wane when Karlsons film premiered; not including the incredibly elongated end credits pic takes up a scant 74 minutes of screen time. Modestly budgeted pic sports a so-so tech package somewhat enhanced by Canadian d.p. Glen MacPhersons widescreen lensing which lends the oft-used B.C. setting its own colloquial air. Curiously the real Pussers background as a professional wrestler has been omitted.
