Comments (1) click to enlarge Metallica Through the Never 3D Recommended Rated R  92 minutes  2013 Along with Hugo Life of Pi and Alfonso Cuarons Gravity this concert movie contains some of the most impressive use of digital 3-D Ive yet encountered. Director Nimrod Antal and cinematographer Gyula Pados achieve some extraordinary deep-focus effects during the performances which were recorded over two nights in Vancouver in August 2012; at times you can see from the middle of the stage out to spectators hundreds of yards away. As if trying to top the bands arena-rock spectacle the filmmakers cram the movie with audacious camerawork executing acrobatic crane shots long-take tracking shots and radical shifts in perspective. Even as someone who finds Metallicas music silly (ditto the movies incoherent apocalyptic fantasy sequences) I was floored by much of the visual imagination.

As evidenced by the bombast of Nimrod Antals ""Metallica Through the Never"" those heavy metal maniacs certainly arent lacking in either spectacle or success after thirty-plus years of rockin with the films narrative segments even going so far as to suggest that their stage show could hardly ever be contained to one measly arena. Much of ""Never"" is a straightforward performance piece with lead vocalist James Hetfield drummer Lars Ulrich guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo thrashing out their standards to a packed house although to call the litany of pyrotechnics that follows ""straightforward"" might be a bit misleading. Coffin-shaped displays drop from the ceiling glowing crosses rise from the floor (itself a massive video screen) lasers and flames shoot out from all around a giant electric chair gets shocked with Tesla coils during ""Ride the Lightning"" and an oversized statue is assembled for ""...And Justice for All"" simply for the sake of collapsing moments later. Its all very appropriately overblown and director Antal (""Vacancy"" ""Predators"") gives the fireworks as much attention as he does each performer. Even if you dont care for the bands particular brand of headbanging antics the concert as shown here is a pretty bitchin tech demo. Furthermore Antal emphasizes the sheer scale of the proceedings opening the film in the sky above the city and sweeping down to the arena parking lot pre-show and later craning over from the stage right into the stands with the kind of immersive 3D that served ""U2 3D"" so well five years ago. Its like that dude in the bottom right corner is flipping dual birds right at YOU Thats not all though. With the entire band credited as co-writers theyve concocted a subplot that sees mostly mute roadie Trip (Dane DeHaan) venturing out to help a stranded tour truck and finding himself in the middle of a vaguely post-apocalyptic scenario unfolding across deserted downtown streets. His experiences roughly correlate to the playlist -- he leaves with gasoline in hand to the strains of ""Fuel"" and puts up a fight against a mob during ""Battery"" -- with Trip avoiding a masked lynch-happy horseback rider at every turn. These nightmarish encounters are a fair measure to reintroduce abstract van-worthy imagery to the world of hard rock but for Metallica these detours see them doubling-down on self-mythology when their own music and mayhem should be trusted to do the trick. Even the concert has its own share of supposed ""mishaps"" that see the quartet eventually stripping away the flashy showmanship in order to focus on their songs. After all for hardcore fans nothing else matters.

Metallica those thrash virtuosos of doom get the grand 3-D opera they deserve a godless-apocalypse-meets-Vegas spectacle full of fireballs and electric chairs. With its hell-bent rhythmic changeups the music channels a dark freedom and James Hetfield is still the boyish biker-jock; he teases the crowd into a feeding frenzy of raw metal power. The hybrid concert/fiction film didnt need its ""plot"" with Dane DeHaan as a roadie on a suicide mission. Hetfield and snarly drummer Lars Ulrich are storybook characters enough.

A small-town cook (Catherine Frot) becomes the personal chef for the president of France (Jean DOrmesson) in a pleasant dramedy inspired by a true story.

Robert Reich a secretary of labor under President Clinton leads us through a sharp-eyed essay-meditation on the rising trend of income inequality.

Gurira acts with fire and pride and at times a despair bordering on instability. B+ --Owen Gleiberman NEW RELEASEMuscle Shoals PG 1 HR. 51 MINS. How did a ramshackle studio in an ""undescript little town"" in Alabama produce some of the most indelible rock and soul music of the 20th century?

""There are press notes over there. Also ear plugs if youd like."" I took the notes and smugly skipped the ear plugs. Stupid me. I should have asked for a blindfold. I dont dislike loud rock (like Pete Townshend I lost some of my hearing to the Who -- and even more to a Clash show at the old Palladium). I still crank up new music. I even like Metallica well enough and enjoyed the doc about them ""Some Kind of Monster."" Its watching ""Through the Never"" thats painful. Give Metallica this much credit at least -- when it came time to do a concert film they didnt just rent a hockey arena (or crumbling old music hall) and cut in a bunch of new fan interviews (or retro interview clips) the way other bands have done. Instead they took a page from the Clash and ""Rude Boy"" -- or perhaps Led Zeppelin and ""The Song Remains the Same"" -- and decided to mix live performance footage with staged narrative sequences. So theres an extravagant concert here -- and also an apocalyptic thriller in which a brave roadie played by Dane DeHaan has to navigate his way through mobs police riots and a gas-masked executioner to run some unexplained errand. If only he was trying to find a better script. The back-and-forth is an idea all right but it soon gives you whiplash. We get ""Enter Sandman"" -- then cut to DeHaan running around. ""Master of Puppets"" -- and then some more creepy stuff about someone called the Death Dealer and a little doll that comes to life. The band members all take credit for this screenplay by the way. I wouldnt if I were them. Because if you can ignore their sad screenwriting efforts Metallica still delivers what die-hard Metallica fans want -- ear-pounding metal-shredding rock as they careen through some of their greatest hits and amp up the visuals with lasers Tesla coils and giant collapsing statues. If youre not a loyal fan -- well this film wont turn you into one. Heard one after another the songs begin to turn into a muddy stream of adolescent pessimism in which the singer screams about his powerlessness and everyone elses hypocrisy. Still its hard not to appreciate the incredibly fleet-fingered playing of lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. And co-founder and frontman James Hetfield has an undeniably strong and masculine screen presence as does Robert Trujillo whos darkly intimidating -- although not enough apparently to scare people into giving his bass its due in the sound mix. (Only co-founder and drummer Lars Ulrich doesnt come across onscreen as a musician or a star; for all the manic faces he makes at the camera as he jackhammers away at his drums he looks less like a metal god than a suburban dad whos really had way too much caffeine.) In the real world concerts build to a climax then return for two or three more; on the screen alas ""Metallica Through the Never"" just kind of peters out. The show ends abruptly after a (staged) onstage accident; then DeHaan wanders back with whatever it was the band sent him to fetch. The credits roll. Fade to black. And unlike real life nobody rises to their feet holding their cellphone aloft and screaming for an encore. Ratings note The film contains violence.

"Metallica Through the Never They should have made it more like KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park. Slate Sign In Sign Up Revisiting KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park the Greatest (And Worst) Glam Rock Adventure Movie of All Time Revisiting KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park the Greatest (And Worst) Glam Rock Adventure Movie of All Time Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateCultureboxArts entertainment and more.Sept. 26 2013 655 PM Metallica Through the Never The bands new concert/adventure film really could have used more zombie policemen and perforated lasers. By Eric Hynes Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park Now this is an adventure. Courtesy Hanna-Barbera Productions/NBC With their new IMAX 3-D spectacular Metallica Through the Never the multiplatinum-selling speed-metal quartet from San Francisco have devised an ambitious way to showcase their music for a new generation of fans. Rather than capture a pre-existing concert they put together a stage show explicitly for this movie filling an arena with more props and pyrotechnics than Nigel Tufnel could dream of and rigging up 24 cameras to give moviegoers an uncanny sense of being there for the jackhammering of ""Master of Puppets"" and the baroque balladeering of ""Nothing Else Matters."" But theres also something else afoot here something to earn the films grandly oblique title a wordless surrealistic adventure narrative that was conceived by the band along with director Nimrod Antal. These fictional sequences are threaded through the song cycle but take place outside of the arena with actor Dane DeHaan playing a roadie sent on a mysterious quest through an apocalyptic cityscape. The idea is to visualize what the mood and lyrics conjure to take the audience on a cinematic journey through the bands greatest hits and to solidify and expand the Metallica brand. Its been a while since weve seen a certifiable rock n roll funhouse adventure film. Music videos rendered them redundant in the 1980s though bubblegum derivations like Michael Jackson Moonwalker and Spice World occasionally popped up in the intervening decades. But in the prime of the mid-1970s the era of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Saturday morning animated musical whodunits like Scooby-Doo curios such as Alice Cooper The Nightmare and the venerable KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park turned rock gods into genre heroes. Fueled by synergistic pretentions and trans-media ambitions yet saddled by inadequate production values and half-assed-at-best storytelling these films were credibility killers that also had a kind of hubristic integrity--bridges too far that crash satisfyingly into the bay. Though its technically superior to any of its forebears and serves as a sonically superlative (if also monotonous) concert film Metallicas batty fantastical elements have effectively awoken this gloriously inglorious genre from a prolonged hibernation. Advertisement Yet except for an opening sequence in which the hoodie-wearing DeHaan enters the arena and spies each member of the band before the show the concert and adventure elements are kept separate. And except for a momentary fake stage disaster in which lead singer James Hetfield utters the Keanu-worthy line ""Whoa ... whats going on?"" the band members are never obliged to act in the film. Judging from Lars Ulrichs brief cameo in Get Him to the Greek this would seem to be for the better. But what pray tell is the point of making a Metallica musical adventure film one in which a gas-masked horseman of the apocalypse lynches street protesters from streetlamps if youre not going to dress up bassist Kirk Hammett as a zombie policeman or have Hetfield shoot perforated laser beams out of his eyes? Oh right because KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park was a work of such cautionary folly that only Michael Jackson was crazy enough to attempt anything like it. This made-for-TV camp landmark in which the aforementioned perforated laser beam was employed was the simultaneous apex and nadir of glam rock outfit KISSs career. It was the second-highest-rated televised event of 1978 (behind only Roots) while also inexorably contributing to the fracturing of the band/brand. After the purportedly tedious shoot at Californias Magic Mountain amusement park each member hustled together poorly received solo albums drummer Peter Criss spiraled deeper into substance abuse and would soon be replaced guitarist Ace Frehleys disaffection would lead to his own exile and the bands spiraling discomfort with their own identity would lead to such desperate measures as a synth-heavy prog rock concept album and the shunning of their trademark makeup masks. Yet Phantom had a transparency of purpose that Metallica Through the Never labors to obscure not to mention a levity that Lars and co. are too busy bench-pressing their own mythology to entertain. I wont make any claims for Phantoms quality--it has ""cheap uninspired quickie"" written all over every haphazardly framed shot--but 35 years later it remains as disarmingly loopy as it was on broadcast date Oct. 28 1978 the Saturday before Halloween. The movie starts with a title sequence in which the four members of KISS--Gene Simmons Paul Stanley Peter Criss and Ace Frehley--materialize in an amusement park as towering platform heel-wearing holograms to sing ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" only to disappear from the telecast for 30 whole minutes (not counting commercials). In the interim we meet Abner Devereaux (Anthony Zerbe) a vaguely European mad scientist type who toils beneath the park and whose experiments in animatronics have secretly branched into human abduction and mind control. When he sees park financing redirected into KISSs hotly anticipated engagement Devereaux plots a hostile vaguely explicated takeover involving an army of albino wolfmen in silver onesies and KISSs evil android doppelgangers. Advertisement The KISS boys do eventually perform several of their hits in something that resembles a legitimate show but otherwise toe the line between ineptitude and catatonia as they vanquish via awkward drop kicks and unseen trampoline-propelled acrobatics a crew of color-coordinated kung fu fighters a dream team posse of Frankenstein Dracula and the Mummy and yes their own doppelgangers. If this sounds like a live-action Scooby-Doo cartoon thats because it is. KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park was produced by none other than Hanna-Barbera the brain trust behind Scooby Shaggy Yogi and Space Ghost. The target audience was clearly young schoolkids--those most likely to be swayed by obscure world-domination plots not to mention rock stars capable of breathing fire. These were not viewers who knew what ""Love Gun"" was really about or understood the bands debt to bondage culture or the New York Dolls; they only saw roller coasters robots and good guys in crazy costumes. (Though Ive no idea how anyone at any age could see Stanleys leotard-framed carpet of chest hair as anything but pornographic.) Although its a far cry from 70s kiddie camp Metallica Through the Never is also pitched toward a younger demographic teens and young adults who might not reach for Ride the Lightning the way that teens of previous generations did. Metallica is much deeper into its career than KISS was in 1978 and continues to enjoy a more respected career path but the goals of their two films are basically the same. Where Phantom put a more traditional storytelling frame around its image-shilling (good guys triumphing over bad) Metallica eschews story for pure unmoored imagery. Since DeHaans character Trip has no backstory no lines of dialogue and a mission thats even hazier than Devereauxs weve no choice but to accept these sequences on purely experiential terms. Trip survives a movie cliche car crash; he hallucinates about wars in which he couldnt have fought; he runs into riot policemen set to clash with street protesters (over what we dont know); then hes chased by a marauding medieval horseman then by citizens who resemble zombies then he soaks himself in gasoline and burns himself alive and yet survives. God knows why any of this happens except to communicate a sense of general darkness and perhaps coolness. Its one giant heavy metal trope dump countercultural co-optation for a dingier video-game-violence-inured generation. Yet whats missing from this rock n roll funhouse adventure revival is well adventure. For all of its seeming randomness its dreamlike free-associative noncausational unfurling not a single image in the entirety of Metallica Through the Never is unexpected. The point is that youve seen these things before--a body submerged in water a cityscape crumbling from a rooftop a bag with unseen contents--and are encountering them here like a remembered melody a barrage of ""visual content"" to be paired with the bands propulsive audio. Its all very handsomely arranged but even with the concert footage nothing ever feels live. Compare it to any moment in the technically and formally appalling KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park a collectively agreed-upon cinematic atrocity that with 23 fewer cameras in play than Metallica still manages to surprise and confound from Frehleys bizarrely persistent reliance on the nonsensical interjection ""Ack"" to Simmonss ginger-stepping in his platforms ever in discord with his menacing scowl. At the end it is said of the defeated villain that ""He created KISS to destroy KISS and he lost."" I still have no idea what that means. And so the adventure continues. It may not be the legacy anyone would have chosen but true rock mythology isnt constructed it rambles on. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Review Metallica Through the Never an intriguing but weird beast - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Metallica Through the Never an intriguing but weird beast ""Metallica Through The Never"" Not a documentary not a concert film -- members of Metallica discuss their new cinematic adventure Not a documentary not a concert film -- members of Metallica discuss their new cinematic adventure August Brown There are all sorts of great rock n roll movies straight concert docs (""The Last Waltz"" ""Gimme Shelter"") road sagas (""Dont Look Back"" ""Dig"") and fictional films (""A Hard Days Night"" ""Quadrophenia"").So what is this weird beast ""Metallica Through the Never""? Its two-thirds orthodox concert flick one-third wordless sci-fi fright show. For Americas biggest metal band its an ambitious but garbled attempt to stir up new evil. Director Nimrod Antal (""Kontroll"" ""Predators"") sets up an intriguing premise for ""Metallica Through the Never."" As the band rages inside a sold-out arena show a young roadie on assignment gets sucked into a battle among balaclava-clad street gangs brutal riot cops and at least one horseman of the apocalypse. If youre at all familiar with Metallicas three decades of sinewy riffage and doom-stricken lyrics it will feel entirely apropos.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013 As a straightforward concert document ""Through the Never"" is excellent. Although the San Francisco-bred band hasnt been at metals artistic vanguard for years it remains a stellar live act and one of the last big draws in rock. The performance footage of ""Through the Never"" is seamlessly stitched from a few tour dates and Antals clever staging captures the bands ferocious instrumentalism.The four members prowl an unusual four-pronged stage in-the-round showing their individual charismas -- drummer Lars Ulrich the curmudgeonly perfectionist bassist Robert Trujillo the low-slung enforcer guitarist Kirk Hammett the baked-looking warlock. The 3-D is generally tasteful (even if you get enough of singer James Hetfields chest hair to feel as if you have to pick it out of your teeth) and the song selections -- ""Hit the Lights"" ""Ride the Lightning"" ""Master of Puppets"" -- will earn devil-horns from old thrash-metal vets and festival novices alike.The problem is that Antal and Metallica took two different movies -- a fine live-band document and a supernatural end-of-days romp -- and smashed them together to make both of them more boring.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments Dane DeHaan (""The Place Beyond the Pines"") is convincing as Trip the weary devoted young Metallica roadie set upon by thugs and demons while retrieving a bag belonging to the band (one cant imagine Kings of Leon or the Black Keys commanding such loyalty today). Antal and the films cinematographer Gyula Pados occasionally wring some real dread out of the scenario. The grim shots of public hangings could make Burzums church-burning singer Varg Vikernes flinch.But like a blast-beat metal drummer lagging behind his band the dialogue-free fictional segments and the live concert footage dont seem to have much to do with each other.Sometimes the problems are metaphysical -- does Metallica know the apocalypse is happening outside its arena show? Is Trip fighting the street rioters or the cops or the evil horseman who seems to be killing everyone simultaneously? And the answer to that movie-driving question of ""Whats in that infernal bag Trips carrying anyway?"" is a jerky cop-out.PHOTOS Iconic rock guitars and their ownersBut mostly the flaws are structural. Just when you get comfy watching a long pulverizing take on ""...And Justice for All"" the film suddenly veers to Trip self-immolating in an alleyway. Then back to the band doing ""Nothing Else Matters"" followed by Trips city-destroying showdown with the dark rider on the roof of the arena.All this disrupts the Metallica show inside only briefly. And to think the Stones barely made it through Altamont.If Antal and the band had a bit of self-awareness they could have made a kind of ""Heavy Metal Parking Lot"" meets ""Quadrophenia"" and ""Evil Dead"" -- a brawny campy genre movie that takes Metallica-ness in wild new directions while showcasing the group at its onstage best. The lean and menacing Metallica circa-1983s ""Kill Em All"" would have loved that movie.Instead ""Metallica Through the Never"" feels more like the group as seen in 2004s droll band-in-couples-therapy documentary ""Some Kind of Monster"" -- a little confused unsure of itself and losing the plot despite having powerful talents at its disposal.

The IMAX 3-D release ""Metallica Through the Never"" is all about reasserting their relevance loudly. Of course its also about doing some energetic-as-ever headbanging. The movies marketing promises a fresh hybrid of concert film and narrative feature. But the band which shares screenwriting credit with director Nimrod Antal (""Predators"") doesnt seem interested in legit narrative. Instead theyre all about hypnagogic flashes and rocking their set making this an old-school music video stretched to feature length. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Metallica serves up fan-pleasing hardcore rock | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMetallica serves up fan-pleasing hardcore rock Metallica Through the Never the bands second concert film provides enough visual imagery and hard rock anthems -- and its in IMAX -- to satisfy hard core fans. By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 26 2013Metallica Through the NeverStarring Dean DeHaan Metallica. Directed by Nimrod Antal. Opening Sept. 27 in various theatres in the GTA. 94 minutes. 14A.Do you have to be a devoted fan of heavy metal heavyweights Metallica to give their latest concert film a rousing devil-horn fingers salute?Perhaps not but it might help.Article Continued BelowThe veteran metal bands latest concert film Through the Never eschews the introspection of its first concert film Some Kind of Monster (2004) -- which chronicled the bands near disintegration -- in favour of loads of its hard-driving retro rock anthems.Served up in sumptuous IMAX 3D the film brings you up close and personal with the four-member band and its nice to say that after three decades the music and the players are holding up pretty well.The camera clearly loves lead vocalist James Hetfield who displays plenty of energy and on-screen charisma and Lars Ulrich displays true virtuosity on the drum set planted centre stage. Backup vocalist/guitarists Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo dont succeed quite as well in establishing a defining stage presence.The show itself -- culled from five shows in Edmonton and Vancouver -- is every metal heads drug-induced dream with bursts of fire shooting upward through the stage coffin-shaped video monitors featuring trapped writhing bodies gushers of electrical sparks and shooting lasers synchronized to the sound of machine gunfire.Some elements of the show the erection and rapid destruction of the rockified version of the Lady Justice statue and the plethora of rising and descending video screens are meant to amp up the spectacle but merely contribute to a sense of clutter.Cynics will note the adoring fandom in the stands consists almost entirely of male Caucasian head bangers -- many of them pot bellied and tattooed -- with a paucity of female accompaniment. At least it is a multi-generational crowd as demonstrated by the multitude of younger fans waving iPhones recording the on-stage theatrics.If theres a discordant note (pun intended) its the fantasy story entwined throughout featuring a young gofer (played by young Leo DiCaprio lookalike Dean DeHaan) who is sent off on a quasi-mystical quest for an unknown object that must be returned to the stadium by concerts end.The city outside is beset by riots with opposing forces of helmeted riot police battling roving bands of hard rock anarchists. After his van crashes Trip (DeHaan) keeps with him a doll wearing a hangmans noose that bears a suspicious resemblance to Osama bin Laden. He also encounters people strung up from lamp posts on his perilous journey along with a hooded hammer-wielding horse rider. After self-immolating Trip is mysteriously resurrected as tall buildings come crashing down.Its fair to say its a storyline that might have resonance for Metallica fans depending on the particular illegal substance theyre tripping on.That said Through the Never succeeds as a concert film by serving up enough dazzling visual wizardry and good ol thrash metal rock to make it a passably engaging experience.Warning if you walk out of Metallica Through the Never and your ear drums arent throbbing in agony get to your nearest otologist. You almost certainly have a significant hearing problem.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

""Metallica Through the Never"" is a concert documentary/apocalypse thriller/Imax 3-D extravaganza a veritable turducken of fantasy film stage spectacle and crushing sonic aggression. The idea I guess was to make a concept album in film form. It plays as if the projectionist mismatched reels of essentially unrelated movies but Im OK with that. If half an hour of bizarro side-narrative fever dream is the price of admission for a gorgeously lensed best-seat-in-the-house hour of chugging rock brutality Ill pay gladly. The film opens at Vancouvers monumental Rogers Arena as crew members set up for the bands massive stage spectacle. The tone is light. In the parking lot we meet the archetypal Metallica fanatic a beer-bellied lummox naturally. A junior roadie named Trip (sleepy-eyed Dane DeHaan) skateboards into the hockey palace bumps into the band members in a series of jokey on-the-fly encounters then receives a mysterious assignment. He must find a stranded van retrieve an all-important satchel and return it backstage at top speed. En route he takes a pill and encounters ""Mad Max""-style eruptions of surreal violence and urban breakdown. While Trip battles a Bane-like hulking executioner and zombie armies of the night the concert roars to life with ""Creeping Death."" The riotously energetic arena performance and literal riots outside have some tenuous thematic connections. The bands death-centric lyrics and arsenal of Grand Guignol stage effects resonate with the terrors afflicting poor trapped Trip. ""Fuel"" kicks off his nighttime journey. His good luck charm (not a very effective one) is a jointed puppet which is surely related to the bands anthem ""Master of Puppets."" Dont ask how or why there are monstrosities prowling Vancouver at midnight. My interpretation is that everything that happens to the gofer after swallowing his pill is hallucination. I hope so because the narrative segments dont make a lick of sense. Most ticket buyers will line up for the music anyway and that is a monument of gnarly beauty. Lead singer/guitarist James Hetfield drummer Lars Ulrich guitar virtuoso Kirk Hammett and bassmaster Robert Trujillo pull out every thrash metal riff giant stage prop laser effect and pyrotechnic gimmick in their 30-year bag of tricks. Director Nimrod Antal (""Predators"") is equally resourceful employing 24 cameras multiple dollies cranes and Steadicams to shoot each song in its own visual style. The result is a portrait of a band at the top of its form blazing through a 14-song ""greatest hits"" set list. Metallica famously survived the kind of internal dissension that destroyed Guns N Roses and theyre all the stronger for it today with undimmed energy and love for what they do. ""Through the Never"" puts the proof right before your eyes and ears.

Jim Farber NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 26 2013 1255 PM Title Metallica Through the Never Film Info R Violence language. Area theaters; in 3-D and IMAX where available. Metallica has always made in-your-face music. Now theyve found a way to make that literal. The band commissioned the first concert movie of their 30-year career ""Through the Never"" as a 3-D IMAX extravaganza. The result lets viewers feel like theyre sliding up and down the fretboard of Kirk Hammetts guitar volleying between the cymbals of Lars Ulrich and swallowing spit spewed by singer James Hetfield. Its so involving you can practically smell the bands sweat. Certainly you can see it flowing floridly as they muscle their way through their most ferocious material filmed over five nights earlier this year in Vancouver and Edmonton. The set ranges from ""Hit the Lights"" off the bands first album through more streamlined later classics like ""Nothing Else Matters"" and ""Enter Sandman."" You dont have to suffer through a single lesser piece. Dane DeHaan plays a young Metallica fan in strange action scenes intercut with the live musical performances in ""Metallica Through the Never."" Its certainly enough to sate any Metallica fan. But for some reason the band didnt trust that the classic material performed expertly and depicted immersively would sufficiently thrill. So they added a plot. Or something like one. Every so often the camera cuts away from the pound-fest to follow the ""story"" of a Metallica fan played by Dane DeHaan whos about 20 years younger than most fans who come to the bands shows. He gets tapped for a mission thats never explained has no logical flow and lacks a resolution. Beavis and Butt-head could have fashioned something more cogent. Luckily continuity isnt the point. The scenario just provides a nice excuse to have cool-looking people beat each other up get hanged or set on fire which it turns out interacts brilliantly with shots of Metallica fans banging their heads to the band. The more violence the merrier. Even better few of the cutaways halt the music. One drawback While the swooping and careening visuals capture the depth and darkness of an arena experience the sound doesnt. As burly as the acoustics in a theater may be theyre spindly compared to the sucker-punch fans prize at an actual Metallica concert. Luckily -- for its visuals alone -- ""Through the Never"" has enough grit and power to deserve two fists up. jfarbernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

They handed out earplugs at the screening. ""Save em for the next Nicholas Sparks movie"" I said. Earplugs are not metal Ive got this slight ringing in my ears or maybe its a roaring can you hear it too? The band is Metallica but the audience is megadef. So the guys do their hits on a giant stage pulsing with sick images while a roadie played by Dane Dehaan that creepy kid from ""Chronicle"" goes outside to drive around the streets on a mysterious mission. Nightmare scenes flash everywhere. Skulls Flameballs Corpses dangling in the night An electric chair Ive never felt so alive This movie is basically ""Spinal Tap"" minus the jokes. Two of the band members have the word ""Metallica"" emblazoned on their clothing. Metallica -- its the band that has to remind fans whom theyre watching James Hetfield croaks out lyrics about bleakness and destruction. The man sounds like a meth-enraged cookie monster. Lars Ulrich creams the drums. Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo shred the guitar and bass. This band makes Pearl Jam sound like N Sync. Everyone snarls and bares their teeth. Grrr Whats everyone so angry about? These dudes are freaking quintillionaires I was mad once too but I was 15. Now Im not a virgin anymore The fans seem really into it though They make the devils-horns sign while pumping their right arms in the air. Its like a moron Nuremberg Theres a song about justice and this giant fake stone statue of Blind Lady Justice gets assembled piece by piece with cranes It was kinda like in ""Spinal Tap"" when they bring down the 18-inch Stonehenge Only this ones cool cause its really freaking huge Black black black. This is the sound of black. Not real black like tragic stuff but poseur black. Black t-shirts. Black knuckle tats. It gets to be samey. It gets to be bland. Its generic. Its Vanillaca Out in the street scenes stuff is getting surreal. Theres a vengeance-minded horseman in a gas mask. There are rioters getting beaten by cops. This DeHaan character douses himself with gasoline and lights a match. Then an angry crowd whales on him with batons Violence -- so metal Toward the end the stage starts to crumble. Metal girders fall down everywhere a guy in flames starts running madly past the band. I kept thinking the only logical ending to the show would be if Metallica actually blew themselves up.

By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Sep 25 2013 1105 AM Is there anything less metal in 2013 than Metallica? Thats not meant as an insult more an observation of necessity. The bands fame has become as outsized as its early guitar solos and its four members -- frontman James Hetfield drummer Lars Ulrich guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo -- have struggled to find their creative footing in the 21st century. Though they remain one of the worlds premiere metal bands theyre still trying to shake free of a decade-and-a-half of negative publicity including the fallout over the Napster lawsuits a handful of poorly received albums (including a particularly ill-conceived one recorded with Lou Reed) stints in rehab the departure of longtime bassist Jason Newsted and the unintentional hilarity of ""Metallica Some Kind of Monster"" which plays out like a sequel to ""Spinal Tap."" But even if Metallica never cut a decent album again at least all that money fortune and glory means the marketing juggernauts have the resources to put on one hell of a show. ""Metallica Through the Never"" sees the band taking a victory lap around three-plus decades of metal domination with an epically staged ""best of"" concert retrospective. The result is as slick as ""Some Kind of Monster"" was gnarly the footage obtained from a series of concerts performed in Canada last year. The band transforms an arena into a rock temple metal worshipers flashing horns to the rafters. Songs as hugely dramatic as "" ... And Justice for All"" ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Master of Puppets"" have a cinematic quality enhanced by elaborate staging an electric chair descends from the ceiling during ""Ride the Lightning"" currents of electricity crackling around the band as they tear through the riffs; an enormous Lady Liberty is constructed and toppled during "" ... And Justice for All."" The use of 3-D effects in theatrical releases has ceased to be a novelty an option now as rote (and often as regrettable) as eating that entire pack of Milk Duds. In most cases its a wildly unnecessary accoutrement that distracts rather than immerses. Not so here. The 3-D effects (best viewed on the largest screen you can find) dont call attention to themselves but gracefully enhance creating a best-seat-in-the-house effect for viewers. It also brings into sharp relief the brute physicality of the performances. The strain on each band members body is clear in closeups of Hetfields grimacing mug Ulrichs darting tongue Hammets sweat-soaked hair and Trujillos hunched simian lope. The 3-D concert footage is unassailably cool. Less assured is the occasional storyline threaded through the film. Running parallel to the concert is a hallucinatory plot about a young roadie (Dane DeHaan) sent on a mission to assure the delivery of a mysterious package to the band. The task takes the roadie on a nightmarish late-night venture through a ravaged post-apocalyptic cityscape with hints of ""Mad Max"" in the bands of roaming marauders. Its a thin plot pieced together between songs and filmed with the dreamlike quality of a music video and as metaphorically subtle as Metallica lyrics (were talking a fight scene set to ""Battery"" and a race across town set to ""Fuel"" -- not exactly thinking outside the box). It makes for a unique sort of concert film but also a weaker one. It would have been better if it had dispensed with the frail narrative or else committed to being completely bananas. But as die-hard Metallica fans well know a little buffoonery is worth weathering for the main attraction. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The last time Metallica agreed to appear in a feature-length documentary the results were more revealing than its members might have hoped. Chronicling the creation of 2003s St. Anger as well as the group therapy sessions that made that albums completion possible Some Kind Of Monster depicted its subjects as vulnerable insecure artists struggling to recapture a collaborative mojo theyd long since lost. (It was the rock doc as breakup movie even if it didnt actually end with the four musicians parting ways.) The band returns to the big screen--the really big one in this case--with Metallica Through The Never which is so fundamentally different from Some Kind Of Monster that it plays like a bona fide corrective. This stereoscopic IMAX vanity project presents the titular rockers not as men but as living legends playing the hits at a gigantic venue for thousands of bellowing diehard fans. In place of introspection there is only lionizing spectacle; if Monster laid bare the wounded egos of metals biggest stars Never simply re-inflates them. Theres nothing revealing about the movie--except perhaps that James Hetfield and company have allowed the roaring approval of the faithful to drown out any lingering self-doubt about their output. Shot using a whopping 24 cameras on what the producers are claiming is the biggest indoor stage ever constructed Through The Never plays like The Black Album of concert films Its enormous slick and occasionally rousing but largely fails to capture the sheer intensity of Metallicas superior 80s work. Director Nimrod Antal (Vacancy Predators) lends the footage culled from several consecutive shows action-movie grandeur. In a novel alternative to the usual backstage filler and interview snippets Through The Never crosscuts between the bands performance and a fictional subplot in which a roadie (Dane DeHaan from Chronicle and The Place Beyond The Pines) braves an urban wasteland during an epic battle between anarchists and riot cops. These scenes are muscularly staged by Antal even as they feel like something of a distraction interrupting the flow of the concert. Perhaps the pulpy narrative material is meant to compensate for the mercenary professionalism of the performers who tear through their career-spanning set list with the mechanical proficiency of a veteran-touring act. Coming to the stage to the epic fanfare of ""The Ecstasy Of Gold"" from The Good The Bad amp; The Ugly--as they have for decades--Metallica make all the expected stops moving from tight early ragers like ""Creeping Death"" and ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" to the slicker lousier tunes of the Bob Rock era. (Admittedly ""The Memory Remains"" sounds a lot cooler here than it does on record if only because the crowd helps out during the lullaby part.) To call the stage show elaborate would be an understatement Storming the U2-style arena surrounded on all sides by cheering fans the band augments its anthems with pyrotechnics tesla coils and stage props worthy of Spinal Tap. Some of these flourishes arent just silly but counterproductive. For example by introducing ""One"" with a flurry of Apocalypse Now special effects they render meaningless the staunchly anti-war sentiments of the song. Late in the set the stage implodes in a blatantly phony mishap ""forcing"" the band to rally for an intimate encore. ""We dont need all this fancy stuff anyway"" Hetfield declares as though he hadnt just spent a couple hours allowing his musicianship to be upstaged by theatrical gimmicks. For these aging masters of puppets what could be more therapeutic than resting triumphantly on laurels?

A rhapsodic chronicle of a young roadies retrieval of a prized band keepsake filtered through a greatest-hits set director Nimrod Antals performance documentary treats Metallica with predictable reverence but falls flat trying to create a coherent throughline for its fictional segments. Nevertheless a sweeping ambitious take on concert films ""Metallica Through The Never"" works well enough visually and certainly musically to make up for its feeble attempt to fictionalize the lengths to which a fan would go for his favorite band. The film opens with a beautiful continuous shot that sweeps across a vast Canadian cityscape down past the concert venue (or one of them) where the band is set to perform a sold-out concert and ends on a close-up of the dinged bumper of a Metallica fans car. As a chubby metalhead gets out and exclaims ""first to arrive last to leave"" Antal sets the tone for his musical odyssey pairing epic adoring cinematography with affectionately canted fandom. Also read Don Jon Review Joseph Gordon-Levitt Aces the Foreplay Flubs the Climax The next shot introduces Trip played by Dane DeHaan who eats pavement while trying to coolly skate his way to work. Unfortunately the films instances of humor are too few and far between but these moments offer a brief respite from the bands propulsive dirges not to mention the post-apocalyptic showdowns that follow. Even if you have mixed feelings about lead singer James Hetfields growling delivery which probably too often sacrifices subtlety for visceral power Metallicas best songs dexterously balance structural complexity and anthem-like scope qualities Antal beautifully highlights via plenty of close-ups of the band members as they perform. Their use of Ennio Morricones ""The Ecstasy of Gold"" as a preamble to their first song - which has served as their intro music since 1983 -- speaks to their operatic ambitions and they completely follow through via a stage setup that allows each member to roam freely in a 360 degree space while oversized props from their classic albums pop up periodically on stage. Moreover the acoustics of the venue complement the chugging wall of sound that emerges from their instruments guaranteeing that theatrical audiences will be able to experience every note with blinding clarity. Admittedly Im not familiar enough with Metallicas songs to know how many of Trips adventures were prophesied - or contextualized here - in their lyrics but ""suburban warfare"" and ""nightmarish drug trip"" seem to be the only subtext of the fictional story all of which makes it that much more underwhelming. DeHaans natural intensity notwithstanding Trip is barely enough of a character to be described as a cipher and the urgency of his cross-town task fluctuates wildly according to the demands of each set piece. Also read Rush Review Ron Howard Shifts Gears With a Sexy Stylish Racing Saga The bag hes sent to retrieve which evidently contains Marcellus Wallaces soul is a classic MacGuffin important only inasmuch as it propels the plot forward. But its mystery feels like a missed opportunity first because its contents could provide Trips journey with more tangible stakes and then because a final solution or revelation might have given the film a finale that tied together the two narratives. In terms of its larger purpose - to obliterate as many of Metallica fans eardrums as possible with a big loud concert -- the only time the film stumbles is when it tries to pair the apocalyptic traumas of Trips story with on stage ""malfunctions"" and ""accidents"" during the bands performance such as when a lighting rig explodes and later a production assistant catches on fire. And while Hetfields momentary concern over his charred employee and jeopardized stage show is admirable it feels even less believable than the fictional story especially when the band pretends to rally for their finale by assembling amps on stage garage-band style without discernibly changing the sound or volume of their performance. But ultimately ""Metallica Through The Never"" feels like the cinematic equivalent of a fans homemade ""greatest hits"" mix tape complete with hand-drawn liner notes that dont quite capture the nuances of their music but nevertheless adoringly embody its spirit.

The concert cinematography (24 cameras were used simultaneously) and sound were incredible -- the person in front of me was so caught up during the bands performance of ""Creeping Death"" I was expecting her to punch someone.Still its hard to shake off the sense that this film is at times massively self-indulgent. Only musicians with large egos would even try to make a grandiose film like this and believe the public would want to see it. A science-fiction writer on LSD couldnt have dreamed up a concert stage this large and elaborate (not that it isnt amazing). Onstage Metallica has more bombs lasers and flamethrowing power than most armies. Going back and forth between the band performing and scenes of anarchy in the streets is a pretty obvious way of saying ""Hey remember us before we were rich and occasionally accused of being out of touch?"" Lastly Im not sure any visual representation of a rock band should have so many close-ups of a drummer. PICTUREHOUSE Director Nimrod Antal and actor Dane DeHaan work on the set of ""Metallica Through the Never."" (Photos  Carole Segal) But one has to recognize the power of the music. And the intervals in which Trip runs around the downtown war zone are just surreal enough to someday push this into classic midnight movie territory. It will make fans remember why they love Metallica and may win a few new followers as well. Just dont take it too seriously either as a story or an artistic expression.

Captured over five Canadian shows from its 2012 tour Metallica can be seen in peak form thrashing out a set heavy on selections from the classic first four albums (including the recently revived title track from ...And Justice for All a complex ten-minute shredder). Arguably the band has never been as tight as it is with lurking bassist Robert Trujillo; director Nimrod Antal knows exactly where to place his roving camera to sop up every double-pedal drum flurry and wailing solo. Maybe because the band enjoyed raves for its daring 2004 psychodrama Some Kind of Monster an experimental narrative is shoehorned in involving a roadie (Dane DeHaan) doing bloody battle in a deserted city. Your heart sinks with every cutaway. But the intrusions are few and theres creativity within the concert itself A mike shorts out a bank of lights crashes down on technicians (Metallica comes this close to orchestrating its own Altamont) and a huge statue is toppled.

The 3D shots of the stage show looked stunning not like 2 dimensional layers piled on top of each other like some 3D movies. Each of the narrative scenes tied in nicely with the concert footage and the transitions between the two were done beautifully. Truly a masterful work of art with a heavy dose of brutality.

It wasnt good for their image but it made for a compelling film. This time they reverse tactics. In Metallica Through the Never the most immersive concert film ever glimpses of the band offstage will only give you the Saturday morning cartoon versions. There are days playing metal must feel like a catch-22 Your music is at its best when its tapping into peoples pain anger and frustrations but if you display any of those emotions as a flesh-and-blood human fans call you a whiny bitch. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Whatever controversies Metallica have stirred up--about their image their crusades against file-sharing their late-period work--theres no question they remain a band that loves to play. How hard must it be to keep your enthusiasm when youve been performing the same song for more than three decades? Apparently not very hard when those songs are ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Battery."" James Hetfield can work the crowd with just a growl. Look at Lars Ulrich grin like a kid at the stage lightning. It might make you say to hell with movie theaters social contract of silence. You want to get up on your seat and pump your fist with the crowd onscreen.Its immersive but not intimate. The concert is cut with fiction-narrative footage showing the saga of Dane DeHaan as Trip a member of the bands crew sent on a quest through abandoned city streets to recover a truck hes told contains something Metallica need for their show. Its a wordless performance in the face of increasingly surreal circumstances like a good long-form music video you might have seen on 120 Minutes in the days when MTV was more like the art kid girls secretly had a crush on and less like the quarterback from a wealthy family who owns a hot tub. To call Trip simply a roadie diminishes him. He has the kind of religious zealotry to do Metallicas bidding that makes martyrs--better he burn himself alive than Metallica do without. Who is he to question? Hes never done anything as good as ""Master of Puppets.""Film DetailsCritics Pick Metallica Through the Never RatingR GenreConcert Running Time93 More Info Trailer No knock against DeHaan a good actor who anchors even the dopiest fantasy sequences but whenever hes onscreen audiences are sure to miss the concert itself and maybe even wonder why the filmmakers didnt focus on the real roadies to create a counterpoint to the music. Mid-set the crew must assemble a 30-foot statue of Justice then demolish it at just the right chord and in such a way that the gargantuan rolling head doesnt crush Ulrichs kit. Consider the precision necessary to send a stuntman on fire across the stage while rigging crashes down around him all without anyone getting hurt No matter how skilled they are at their jobs there must be enormous pressure to pull it off right something Hetfield probably knows too well after a pyrotechnic accident 20 years ago caused him to suffer second- and third-degree burns.As for the music Theres a good chance you already know how you feel about it and there isnt much I can tell you. At IMAX prices it might be cheaper to buy an album or two but that wont replicate the Through the Never experience. Its taken just a couple years for 3D to go from the future of cinema to just another way to charge more for the same old crap. When Christopher Nolan says you wont need special glasses to see his new movie thats taken as a mark of integrity. When 3D is announced for The Lone Ranger its a confirmation of your worst suspicions. Now comes Through the Never to remind us of the value of the technology done right. This is a movie made for people who mash themselves up against those steel crowd-control barriers at concerts and still dont think theyre close enough. Those faithful are rewarded here with a better look at the texture of the drum skins and the battered stock of the guitar all close up enough to for you to fake a sense memory of what playing might feel like. Sadly the film is only 90 minutes which seems brief for a band with so deep a catalog.As for Trip--I feel for the guy. I dont know a thing about him what led him to Metallica or how he feels at the end of his journey but I cant help but empathize whenever hes onscreen.

TWITTER The thrash metal overlords star in a head-banging ear-bashing sense-swamping 3D concert film with added horror elements. TORONTO -- A state-of-the-art concert movie shot in 3D and IMAX formats Metallicas latest cinematic venture confirms their position as the worlds biggest loudest most commercially successful heavy rock band. Nine years after baring their souls in the unwittingly hilarious group-therapy documentary Some Kind of Monster the San Francisco-based quartet take no chances with their platinum-plated brand this time around. Framed in ultra-vivid visuals and super-crisp sound these black-clad warriors of Nietzschean uber-metal prowl and growl through their gnarly snarly riff-crunching greatest hits like cartoon superheroes. In addition to the live footage Hungarian-American horror director Nimrod Antal also includes a fantasy dramatic subplot that recalls his previous work in gory action thrillers like Kontroll and Predators. The result is a kind of live-action computer-game blown up to immersive billboard dimensions. It makes little sense but captures some of the macabre intense hyper-aggressive spirit of Metallicas music. Premiered in Toronto this week Through The Never rolls out theatrically later this month. Business should be brisk considering the band remains a huge global draw selling over 100 million albums during their 30-year career. PHOTOS The Scene at the Toronto Film Festival 2013 Former thrash-metal outsiders who gave heavy metal a much-needed jolt of punk attitude during the pre-grunge 1980s Metallica are now arena-filling megastars with the kind of weapons-grade stage show their status demands. Recorded over five nights in Vancouver and Edmonton during the bands marathon World Magnetic tour last year Through the Never captures for posterity a slick multi-camera spectacle well suited to the hyper-intense detail of high-end 3D and IMAX. You can almost smell the money dripping off the super-sized screen. Arriving onstage to Ennio Morricones classic spaghetti-western theme The Ecstasy of Gold in long-standing Metallica tradition singer James Hetfield locks effortlessly into fist-pumping turbo-roaring rock-gladiator mode while hyperactive drummer Lars Ulrich spends half the concert on his feet forever exploding out of his seat like Keith Moon of The Who. Playing in the round on a massive high-tech platform that doubles as a vast video screen the band pinball around the stage as the panels beneath them pulse with lakes of blood squirming maggots prematurely buried souls trapped inside glass-topped coffins and other lurid imagery. Metallica blow up every morbidly obsessed teenage metalheads bedroom fantasies into a Las Vegas-level theme-park thrill ride. Over the bands heads meanwhile the arena blazes with laser beams pyrotechnics and mechanical stage props. A giant electric chair fizzes and crackles in Ride the Lighting a towering statue of ""blind justice"" rises and topples during And Justice for All and a forest of graveyard crosses sprout for One the brooding antiwar anthem now firmly established as Metallicas answer to Hotel California. The film is dedicated to the late Mark Fisher the legendary British stage architect who designed this eye-popping spectacle plus others for Pink Floyd Rolling Stones U2 Lady Gaga the London Olympics and many more. PHOTOS Toronto 21 Hot Festival Titles for Sale Woven around the songs the narrative subplot adds visual variety but lacks dramatic weight. Rising star Dane DeHaan best known to date for the HBO series In Treatment gives an almost wordless performance as a young Metallica roadie who is dispatched mid-show to collect a mysterious package for the band. However his nocturnal odyssey across the city becomes a dystopian sci-fi nightmare of mass lynchings burning vehicles and crazed zombie-punk revolutionaries led by a masked horseman. There are echoes here of Mad Max and Batman Begins plus the recent global rash of street revolutions. But no context no conclusion just hallucinatory carnage for its own sake. Metallica have shot numerous concert films before most recently Quebec Magnetic a fairly routine 2D affair recorded on the same tour. But this is their best to date with music and visuals both cranked up to 11 and beyond. However mindless and heartless it may be Through the Never succeeds as pure sense-swamping spectacle. It is a blow-out banquet for Metallica fans and a blockbuster rock-and-rollercoaster ride for any heavy metal tourists curious to see this music played at major-league level.

If 2004s ""Metallica Some Kind of Monster"" was a rare rock documentary of interest to people who might not necessarily care for the music as it chronicled attempts to resolve interpersonal conflicts that very nearly broke the titular band apart ""Metallica Through the Never"" is for fans who dont need any feelings explored that they cant headbang to. A set list consisting of greatest hits from more than three decades of history a dynamic stage show Imax 3D presentation and a silly but diverting fantasy narrative make this a definitive document for anyone whos ever hoisted the devil-horn fingers in metalhead solidarity. This first U.S. release from the revived Picturehouse Entertainment opens on 300-plus Imax 3D screens Sept. 27 then expands Oct. 4. The majority of the pic is a straightforward but elaborately crafted (what with 24 cameras multiple cranes etc.) translation of the groups 2012 touring concert cobbled together from five nights in Vancouver and Edmonton. The show (designed in large part by John Mark Fisher whose prior live-rock extravaganzas include Pink Floyds legendary ""The Wall"" tour) is nothing if not aesthetically ambitious weaving running motifs from Metallica lore into a package that encompasses a floor of panels on which images are projected (including 5000 squirming colored maggots) Tesla coils lasers flames crosses that rise from below the stage five actors screaming inside coffins they wake up sealed in a giant ""blind justice"" statue that breaks apart and so forth. Nonetheless the four musicians arent overwhelmed by all this showmanship as theyre in crackerjack form and expert at rousing the crowd -- even if this kind of performance scale means theyre often playing in physical isolation from each other exhorting viewers seated in the round from opposite sides of a uniquely shaped long platform. (The ruse of some apocalyptic event nearly wrecking the stage allows them to revisit small-venue days of yore by clustering together amid the rubble for a parting ""Hit the Lights"" from 1983 debut album ""Kill Em All."") As thrash metal pioneers Metallica played a big role in stripping metal of its 70s bloat and bringing in a fast/tight sensibility from punk music. Still too much compact crunch can be a little monotonous so beyond including a few slower-tempo tunes the band and director Nimrod Antal (of Hungarian cult hit ""Kontroll"" plus U.S. thrillers ""Vacancy"" and ""Predators"") devised a storyline starring young actor Dane DeHaan (also at Toronto in ""Kill Your Darlings"" and ""Devils Knot""). Hes ""Trip"" a tour gofer whod rather watch the show but who instead gets sent on a mysterious errand into an eerily deserted city. On foot after a car crash he watches anarchist types in hoodies attack riot police then each other then (for no obvious reason) him led by a murderous specter on horseback. (One of the films very few jokes is a final shot underlining that we never did learn just what the object of Trips errand run was.) Energetically staged if not exactly deep like Metallicas lyrics this mini-horror-fantasy-adventure trades trades in metal nihilism that really doesnt bear much thinking about if youre over 15 and/or not titanically stoned. The narrative bits serve well to break up the concert sequences offering distraction without ever overstaying their welcome. After all vaguely ""Mad Max""-like dystopian miniatures are nice but ""Master of Puppets"" ""Enter Sandman"" et al. are what this movies audience really came for. Sound mix is naturally tremendous and every other tech/design contribution is tops. Toronto Film Review Metallica Through the NeverReviewed at Toronto Film Festival (Special Event) Sept. 9 2013.

DetroitThrash says September 20 2013 at 1237 pm Typical ""critic"" spouting condescension about childish heavy metal. Reply Thomas says September 16 2013 at 332 am Next time you review somthing make sure you mention there is a huge spoiler in it. Douche Reply crista fletcher says September 14 2013 at 738 pm my fiance and i would love to see metallica live it has been a dream of ours for a while..we watch the rockin live in rio and its amazing every time. i could just imagine them live .. Reply Joe says September 14 2013 at 715 pm In early 1982 Metallica recorded its first original song ""Hit the Lights"" for the Metal Massacre I compilation.This demo tape was recorded in McGovneys garage during March 1982. The demo has never been officially released. The writer states that Metallicas lyrics are not exactly deep and therefore superficial. This is only exposing his lack of research. A common and well known disease among journalists which has nothing to do with ""eye of the beholder"". About a few lyrics The lyrics and the video of ""ONE"" are based on the novel Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo. A song about those who are affected by the cruelties and horror of war. ""Sanitarium"" is based on One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1962) a novel written by Ken Kesey. Blackened Harvester of Sorrow Master of puppets Mama said Creeping death and Justice for all bleeding me sad but true...........etc.etc. etc.... Lyrics concerning all aspects of life like history religion human relations psychology society war etc.. Offcourse these are matters we all have thought over from birth and which we can drop at the age of 15. Dennis Harvey failed to do his homework before picking up his pencil. Perhaps he was titanically stoned when writing this review? Reply Tracy Paseman says September 13 2013 at 751 am Kill Em All released in 1983 Reply paraskeuas says September 12 2013 at 444 am kill em all was in 1981 fire the useless who wrote this Reply Tracy Paseman says September 11 2013 at 327 pm James Hetfields lyrics are considered the deepest in the metal genre and is one of the reasons Metallica touches millions of fans all over the globe. I myself cant hear ( Welcome Home) Sanitarium Bleeding Me or Fade To Black without crying. And by the way Im a 50 year old female who has seen them in concert 21 times to date and I assist surgeons in the operating room for a living. So much for stereotypes. Reply Mark Glenshaw says September 11 2013 at 1101 am A little fact-checking please. Metallicas debut album ""Kill Em All."" came out in 1983 not 1995. In 1995 they were working on their sixth and seventh albums ""Load"" and ""Reload."" Also Mr. Harvey implies that the median age of Metallica fans is in the mid-teens. For a band that has been around for over thirty years this is simply not the case. A quick look at the age range of the audience in the film would bear that out quickly. While fans of leafy substances are counted among Metallica fans they are not in the majority as say fans of bands like Phish or Jakes Leg. Metallica fans tend to be drinkers not tokers. Lastly Metallicas lyrics are generally regarded as deep and thought-provoking. One such example is that there is a book about their music/lyrics and philosophy http//www.amazon.com/Metallica-Philosophy-Crash-Course-Surgery/dp/1405163488 Thank you for your time. Reply Justin Chang says September 12 2013 at 700 am Thank you for the correction Mr. Glenshaw. The date has been fixed above. Reply Mark Glenshaw says September 13 2013 at 539 am Thank you for making the correction Mr. Chang. malowski says September 11 2013 at 141 pm Well put.
