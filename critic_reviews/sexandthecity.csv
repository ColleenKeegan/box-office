The self-described ""sexual anthropologist"" gets her information from praisery owner Samantha (Kim Cattrall) willing and able to do anything; art dealer Charlotte (Kristin Davis) whos on the constant lookout for Mr. Right; lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) a study in the overstudied approach to all things male; and of course her own independent activities. Its a hopeless world out there but newspaper columnist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is throwing her libido in the laboratory to sort it all out for the masses. The self-described ""sexual anthropologist"" gets her information from praisery owner Samantha (Kim Cattrall) willing and able to do anything; art dealer Charlotte (Kristin Davis) whos on the constant lookout for Mr. Right; lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) a study in the overstudied approach to all things male; and of course her own independent activities. HBO is launching its 12-part comedy series based on Candace Bushnells book of the same name with a doubleheader -- the pilot and episode ""Models and Mortals."" Pilot finds Bradshaw studying women who have sex like men -- do the act and feel nothing afterward. ""Models"" has her observing men and women who date only beauties from the catwalk and magazine pages asking that age-old question How much power do beautiful people have? Its talkshow fodder played out as a fact-driven drama. Both episodes play spin the bottle with the issues and land everywhere but the right places. They possess a wanton thirst for either pleasure or interrogation and predictable actions and consequences abound Samantha will wind up in bed Miranda will question a mans every word or motive Bradshaw will draw up some pithy comment. (A couple that goes from shopping for a townhouse to breakup in one step attracts the observation ""Cupid has flown the co-op."") Cattrall Davis and Nixon inhabit their characters with full-bodied believability cracking the dating minefield with moral codes that range from ""What? Me worry?"" to the straight and narrow. Their gabfests while not necessarily enlightening bring out the shadings of each woman; collectively they feel lost in their 30s too established for the carefree twentysomethings and too under-the-radar for career-obsessed men in their 40s. Parkers presence provides a star quality though she plays directly to the audience with a bit too much regularity doling out advice one moment and rhetorically asking for help on which path to take the next. Yet creator Darren Star (""Beverly Hills 90210"") has given her very precise targets -- she beats up on ""toxic bachelors"" and ""modelizers"" rather than men in general and she goes after women as much as she slams men. Still the Bradshaw character rarely laughs at these foibles -- her cynicism is less than that of her comrades in general and in particular your average newspaper columnist. A compelling subplot concerns run-ins with rich power broker Mr. Big (Chris Noth) providing the shows greatest sexual tension. Noth (Detective Mike Logan on ""Law amp; Order"") is the great ""what if?"" the potential suitor who commands attention and ample flirting without committing to as much as a date. Its a pattern that drove the early years of ""Moonlighting"" ""Remington Steele"" and even ""Friends"" and here Noth and Parker have a chemistry articulated with coolness and restraint a rarity in series television. Carol Sue Baker supplies a nifty Latin theme to accompany an incongruous credit sequence that suggests Bradshaw is living a serious bad-luck streak. Locations are top-notch from A-1 Gotham apartments and splashy restaurants and nightclubs to grungy hangouts and hovels. Pacing is crisp and mood-setting lighting is always on target. Sex and the City(SERIES COMEDY-DRAMA; HBO SAT. JUNE 6; 945 P.M.) ProductionFilmed in New York by HBO. Executive producer Darren Star; co-executive producers Barry Jossen Michael Patrick King.

Chris Noth Stanford Blatch ..... Willie Garson Skipper Johnston ..... Ben Weber Its dialogue seemingly cribbed from ""The Rules"" ""Men Are From Mars ..."" and other 90s relationship psychobabble ""Sex and the City"" follows four upscale attractive women through the sexual subway of contempo Gotham. Single and in their 30s each is a distinct blend of guile guts and needfulness traipsing through the dating world with predictable and even trite results their chatter constantly hitting on sex relationships and sex. Some good acting and some nicely shot romantic interludes provide some redemption for the series but scripts need to loosen up and inherit some of the playfulness the actresses bring to their roles.

Related NPR Stories How to Escape Watching Sex and the City May 29 2008 Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex to Sensibility April 11 2008 Its been four years since the TV finale of Sex and the City and the gals are much as they were when their fans last saw them Charlottes still a wide-eyed dreamer with her adopted daughter in tow. Neurotic Miranda can still be prickly perhaps because of that commute from Brooklyn. Samanthas live-in Hollywood hunk isnt enough to keep her from feeling constricted by monogamy. And Carrie? Well after years of on-again off-again with Big shes talked him into tying the knot. At which news a restaurant full of Manhattanites breaks into applause. If you follow the show youll be pleased to note that in addition to oceans of pink cocktails and much ado about Louis Vuitton -- the latter prompted mostly by the presence of former Dreamgirl Jennifer Hudson -- there are emotional crises galore a trip to Mexico (mostly for a change of scenery) and no fewer than three separate fashion parades one of which involves wedding gowns that make Sarah Jessica Parker appear to be drowning in everything from whipped cream to popcorn. Like everyone in the film Parkers Carrie encounters obstacles and her posse faces those obstacles together surrounding her with a family that has nothing to do with genetics. And if this fabulously decked-out foursome is self-absorbed enough to be inadvertently cruel on occasion they also suffer lots of guilt -- though their angst is rendered somewhat less angsty for viewers by the zingers the designers and the cheerfully objectified men on display. Writer-director Michael Patrick King who shepherded the TV series through its last couple of seasons knows what fans like -- and he has provided close to five episodes worth in the movie which clocks in at roughly two-and-a-half hours. Thatll be a little much for non-fans but it seemed to please the crowd at the press screening I attended. Admittedly the energy did seem to go out of the auditorium about halfway through the picture when the projectors framing slipped so that microphones were suddenly visible at the top of the screen -- but you couldnt see anyones shoes. And there were some gasps at the very beginning when the projectionist started with the wrong wide-screen lens -- briefly turning the heroines into plus-size dames walking arm in arm. (Not quite the big-screen expansion the capacity crowd was expecting.) But for the most part this celebration with Carrie amp; Co. -- television writ large murmurs the hidebound critic in me -- seems precisely the Sex and the City reunion the shows fans had hoped for.

By Anthony Lane Superannuated fantasy posing as a slice of modern life Kristin Davis Sarah Jessica Parker Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall.   Credit DAVID HUGHES Secrecy has clouded ""Sex and the City"" since it was first announced. When would the film appear? Who would find a husband? Would one of the main characters die? If so would she commit suicide by self-pity (a constant threat) or would a crocodile escape from the Bronx Zoo and wreak a flesh-ripping revenge for all those handbags? As the release date neared the paranoia thickened; at the screening I attended we were asked not only to surrender our cell phones but to march through a beeping security gate as if boarding a plane to Tel Aviv. There was even a full-body pat-down by far the biggest turn-on of the night. Not a drop of the forthcoming plot had been leaked in advance but I took a wild guess. ""Apparently"" I said to the woman behind me in line ""some of the girls have problems with their men break up for a while and then get back together again."" ""Oh my God"" she cried. ""How do you know?"" What followed was not strictly a movie. It was more like a TV show on steroids. The televised episodes which ran from 1998 to 2004 lasted for no more than half an hour each. So spare a thought for the director of the film Michael Patrick King who also wrote the screenplay. Faced with the flimsiest of concepts he had to take it by both ends and pull until he stretched it out to two and a quarter hours. Two and a quarter When Garbo made ""Anna Karenina"" in 1935 she got happy unhappy loved left and under the train in less than a hundred minutes so how the hell are her successors supposed to fill the time? To be fair there are four of them--banded together like hormonal hobbits and all obsessed with a ring. As the story begins two are married already. First there is Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) who has a job a child and not enough sex with her husband Steve (David Eigenberg) perhaps because he reminds her of Radar from ""MASH."" Then comes Charlotte (Kristin Davis) who is blissfully wedded to--well what is she wedded to exactly? He goes by the name of Harry (Evan Handler) but hes a ringer for Dr. Evil from the ""Austin Powers"" franchise with all the evil sucked away; what remains is fey and shiny-headed smiling sweetly about something known only to himself. For a movie about the need for real men--lusty loyal and loaded--this unusual earthling is truly a most peculiar advertisement for the gender. Next we have Samantha (Kim Cattrall). Everyone has Samantha or had her at some point; so she would like us to believe and this is where the film of ""Sex and the City"" begins to part company with the original. The TV show was smart enough to trade on both the sentimentality and the shockability of its viewers encouraging them to sigh at romantic satisfaction and at the same time to snicker at the dirty talk that gave it spice. Behind it all one caught a whiff of stale Puritanism despite the womens knowing bid for urbanity there was an old-school anti-sophisticated wish to put desire in its proper place or better still to disperse it in a shared public giggle for fear of where it might lead. Now the whiff has become a blast and Samanthas efforts to signal her appeal which might have seemed languorous on the small screen are blown up here into an embarrassing semaphore thudding closeups of her slurping through a cocktail straw or swallowing a mouthful of guacamole. No self-respecting maker of soft erotica would countenance such shots and as for the matching dialogue (""Something just came up"" Samantha murmurs over the phone as her boyfriend stands beside her in bulging briefs) it sounds like a flaccid aside from 007. In a daring plot development she buys a dog the size of a childs slipper; the camera keeps cutting away to it and guess what--the pooch screws too Mirth is unconfined. I was never sure how funny the TV series was meant to be. It kept lapsing into a straight face even a weepy one as the characters contentmentcame under serious threat. This uncertainty survives into the movie which made me laugh precisely once as a magazine editor let fly with a Diane Arbus gag. It is no coincidence that she is played by Candice Bergen who gets just the one scene but who is nonetheless the only bona-fide movie star on show. You cannot simply shift a load of television actors onto a movie screen and expect them to command its greater expanse; only one in a thousand will be able to summon that mysterious confluence of presence and reserve on which stardom relies--the will both to offer oneself to the camera and yet to keep back the hidden unguessable sources of that self. We should not be surprised therefore that Kim Cattralls come-ons wilt in the transition; but who would have guessed that Sarah Jessica Parker a nimble performer who has had a career in movies should also seem diminished and ill at ease? She plays Carrie the writer whose voice-overs keep us up to speed with the doings of her friends and with the reckless amassing of what she calls ""the two Ls labels and love."" Whether Carrie is able to acknowledge how tightly the two Ls lock together in her mind is another matter. Early in the film she receives a proposal of marriage from her long-term boyfriend Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and this triggers a Babylonian orgy of spending. In a montage of wedding-dress fittings she honors ""new friends like Vera Wang and Carolina Herrera and Christian Lacroix Lanvin and Dior"" and so on; what I object to is not the name-dropping--think of it as a chick response to ""American Psycho""--but the montage itself which is shot in lazy veils of schmaltz. Compare the quick-change sequence in ""Funny Face"" with Audrey Hepburn robed in one Givenchy masterpiece after another and you sense not merely the greater snap in Stanley Donens direction (with more than a hand from Richard Avedon) and the hotter bloom of the coloring but the way in which Hepburn herself outglows the frocks with her smile and her imperious shout--""Take the picture take the picture"" No thoroughbred was ever just a clotheshorse. The women in ""Sex and the City"" by that standard are little better than also-rans and their gallops of conspicuous consumption seem oddly joyless as displacement activities tend to be. ""Because Samantha couldnt get off she got things"" Carrie says. Look at the beam in your own eye sister. Mr. Big not only buys her a penthouse apartment (""I got it"") he offers to customize the space for her shoes and other fetishes. ""I can build you a better closet"" he says as if that were a binding condition of their sexual harmony if he builds it she will come. The creepiest aspect of this sequence was the sound that rose from the audience as he displayed the finished closet gasps fluttering moans and beside me two women applauding. The tactic here is basically pornographic--arouse the viewer with image upon image of what lies just beyond her reach--and the film makes feeble attempts to rein it in. When the wedding hits a bump (look out for Kristin Davis screaming ""No No"" at Chris Noth like a ninth grader auditioning for ""The Crucible"") and the bridegroom veers away our heroines reaction to the split is typical ""How am I going to get my clothes?"" What honey even the puffball skirt that you wear to the catwalk show--the one that makes you look like a giant inverted mushroom? That plea gets second prize for the most revealing line in the film the winner being Mirandas outburst as she hunts for an apartment in a mainly Chinese district ""White guy with a baby Wherever hes going thats where we need to be."" So thats what drives these people Aryan real estate. At least you could argue Miranda has a job as a lawyer. But the film pays it zero attention and the other women expect her to drop it and fly to Mexico without demur. (And she does.) Worse still is the sneering cut as the scene shifts from Carrie carefree and childless in the New York Public Library to the face of Mirandas young son smeared with spaghetti sauce. In short to anyone facing the quandaries of being a working mother the movie sends a vicious memo Dont be a mother. And dont work. Is this really where we have ended up--with this superannuated fantasy posing as a slice of modern life? On TV ""Sex and the City"" was never as insulting as ""Desperate Housewives"" which strikes me as catastrophically retrograde but almost sixty years after ""All About Eve"" which also featured four major female roles there is a deep sadness in the sight of Carrie and friends defining themselves not as Bette Davis Anne Baxter Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter did--by their talents their hats and the swordplay of their wits--but purely by their ability to snare and keep a man. Believe me ladies were not worth it. Its true that Samantha finally disposes of one paramour but only with a view to landing another and her parting shot is a beauty ""I love you but I love me more."" I have a terrible feeling that ""Sex and the City"" expects us not to disapprove of that line or even to laugh at it but to exclaim in unison ""You go girl."" I walked into the theatre hoping for a nice evening and came out as a hard-line Marxist my head a whirl of closets delusions and blunt-clawed cattiness. All the film lacks is a subtitle ""The Lying the Bitch and the Wardrobe.""  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Related Handicapping Sex and the City Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Like the stampede the moment the doors open for a Filenes Basement white sale the crush of women at theaters this weekend to see the big-screen version of Sex and the City should be intense. On Tuesday night for the films invitational premiere swarms of femi-nests buzzed expectantly outside Manhattans Radio City Music Hall. And when many of the ticket-holders couldnt get into the 6000-seat Hall because of overbooking the anger and hurt spilled onto Sixth Avenue literally stopping traffic. Near the front of the line of rejectees according to the New York Daily News were two women from Vancouver B.C. who had paid 16000 for the trip to New York (they must have driven here) and were dolled up in designer dresses and stiletto heels. You should have realized ladies that those things can be used as weapons. The most reliable demographic for a big box-office weekend is teen boys who cant get dates. Traditionally when a film opens young males come more quickly than the several generations of female this one is aimed at. But SATC -- a continuation of the HBO babes-in-bonding series that ran for six seasons and ended in 2004 -- is already sold out for many of its midnight shows tonight and evening performances on Friday. .. The film is clearly a lifeline for the Sex-deprived. By Sunday if the early buzz translates into huge ticket sales Hollywood may have to consider a new truism theres instant girl power at the movies. We mean girls of all ages from precocious tweens to denizens of rest homes and the Red Hat Society. But especially the thirtysomethings the moms and unmarrieds who in Carrie Bradshaw and her friends could see themselves as sassy career gals gossiping about who had the most volcanic orgasm. Perhaps they also connected with the iconic working woman of their time as Mary Tyler Moores Mary Richards had been a generation before. (And unquestionably the show gave its fans a smart laugh or two.) So naturally theyre primed for the SATC movie which was written and directed by Michael Patrick King an executive producer of the show. For them its what Grand Theft Auto IV is to their sons and a Hannah Montana concert to their daughters -- a gotta-have cultural event. Now comes the requisite paragraph where I say Im not really qualified to comment on either the series or the movie because Im (a) male and (b) straight. And yet having both those infirmities I also feel estranged at times from Judd Apatow films. I have the anachronistic notion that romantic comedies neednt be exclusively partial to one gender; they should be critical and loving and true to both. So Ill soldier on with my mixed distant defiantly ignorant review of this 142-minute trifle -- which comes close to being the longest non-musical romantic comedy in Hollywood history. Followers of the series know that Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) a journalist thinks shes found Mr. Right in Mr. Big (Chris Noth); that randy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has moved to California with her actor-boyfriend Smith (Jason Lewis); that Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has married salt-of-the-earth Steve (David Eigenberg); and that Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is hitched to the homunculus Harry (Evan Handler). And at this point Im supposed to say no more. As if it were the last Harry Potter book the SATC publicists have begged critics not to reveal the intricacies of the plot. So trying to balance journalism and gallantry I am providing a rundown but with certain words or phrases anagrammed in boldface to obscure their import -- you can find the corrected words at the bottom of the piece. Let the nosy piss (synopsis) begin Carrie and Mr. Big have finally decided to migrate red but he gets clef toed and is a how son at the my encore. Instead of her oh no money Carrie spends time at a Mars excretion being consolidates in the company of her patchy timesfriends who have their own lob sperm. Miranda has boredom issues with Steve who is briefly a flu fun hit provoking her to have lime. Charlotte who has radiated glop but still hopes to vibe right finds out that she angers pint. And Samantha gets axe sully distracted by the sight of a lewd lewd eon gent next door. Miranda and Carrie have a gainful lot because one of them told the beau of the other to seal stingy but the two circle one on a weeny verse. At the end all the stories are resolved la hippy as our four femmes go nab a dingo by drinking tampon colossi. SHOP GIRLS When Pretty Woman came out in 1990 it was a smash especially with women and I hated it. Jeffrey Katzenberg who ran the studio that made the film explained what I was missing ""You dont understand shopping."" SATC is similarly attuned to the shopping impulse to the joy of having and even more the thrill of coveting Carrie knows Big is her soul mate because in their new apartment he magically produces what she most desires extra closet space which is the most elusive real estate in New York. Samantha practically has a crisis of conscience when her 50000 bid is topped at a Christies auction of jewelry from a zillionaires ex-wife. (Scholars of celebrity divorces will recognize this as the Ellen Barkin garage sale.) In SATC as in fashion magazines like Vogue and In Style the editorial is indistinguishable from the advertising. You cant tell where the drama ends and the product placement begins. Carries friendship with her new assistant (Dreamgirls Jennifer Hudson) is cemented with the gift of a Louis Vuitton purse; and in one climactic scene the humans trying to spill out their emotions are upstaged by a Manolo Blahnik shopping bag. Posh brand names show up everywhere occasionally with severe consequences (Carrie is effectively led astray by a Vivienne Westwood dress) but mostly to suggest the luxe that goes with the womens lust. The movie continues one hallmark of the TV series all the stars but Parker go topless. And poaching on Apatow territory the film matches a glimpse of a healthy penis with a view of the russet pubic moss luxuriating below Mirandas swimsuit line. But there are more male buttocks than female breasts on display here as if to appeal to the shows other core constituency -- gay men. Thats fine with me since gay screenwriters are the last ones who believe that comedy needs verbal wit that the epigram still has a place in movies. (Though disappointingly there are precious few mots in this one.) Obsessed as it is with lust and looking the movie naturally wants its stars to look great. Theyre not kids any more Parker and Davis are 43 Nixon 42 and Cattrall 51. (I know Harrison Ford is 65 but you know that the camera and the audience are kinder to aging male stars than females.) But their characters are youngish at least in their minds. Like a lot of us they refuse to grow up or old; they need to stay fit and sexy to sustain a satiny early-20s robustness straight into senility. And whether Carrie and her friends are heroic or delusional they arent the only ones. Last night The Daily Show played a news clip of a talking head discussing John McCains medical records and noting that he seemed in good health proclaimed that ""71 is the new 30."" Back to Jon Stewart who added ""and Dead is the new 50."" Sparing you my construction-workers appraisal of each actress current state of preservation or decay Ill just say that the wonder is Cattrall whos managed to retain her erotic shine from her first film the 1975 Rosebud undiminished. The camera examines her face tracks up her tanned legs nuzzles or nestles in her cleavage and can find no flaw as if she were the prize creation of a CGI wizard. One scene -- where Samantha as a treat for Smith lies nude on their dining room table her body garnished with sushi -- could be a chic photo essay in either Maxim or Gourmet. I dont know the particulars of Cattralls maintenance regimen but as a friend of mine said about another gorgeous 50-plus actress ""If shes had work its great work."" (The other major character in the film is New York City playing the role it filled in Hollywood comedies of the 30s and 40s the capital of glamour and sophistication. Today Old New Amsterdam is pushing 400 and it still looks fabulous) In SATC what keeps the characters young is their abiding friendship the sisterhood of shared confidences and ego-boosting of advice offered in good faith and accepted in gratitude of a timely phone call when a pals spirits are low. (""I just called"" one woman says nicely paraphrasing Stevie Wonder ""to make sure you werent hanging from your shower rod."") Learning and hugging. Theres lots of that here -- woman to woman and man to woman -- which satisfies the movies fantasy fulfillment of both amity and eros. SATC spends too much time dawdling but at the end it boils its theme down to 12 words. An estranged couple once communicated by reading love letters from famous people. Now the longtime stud sends this e-mail to his wounded partner ""I know I screwed it up but I will love you forever."" Devotion and apology in a single sentence. Thats a love letter for the ages.

The production captures the way TV used to be -- before cable alas and before the advent of groundbreaking shows like ""SATC"" that pushed ripped and shredded the envelope of episodic entertainment. Its fitfully enjoyable and maybe better than that for those who loved the series and have been waiting eagerly for more. But in contrast to the series which was quick-witted fast-paced and self-ironic -- oh and sexy -- the movie is earnest often aimless (couldnt anyone cook up a plot?) visually bland (except for the fashion shows) and at two minutes short of 21/2 hours a decreasingly amiable meander. Heres one helping of more that manages to be less. Thats not to say the story scants the shows L-words Labels and Love. The designer labels come first and furious -- whats-his-names pointy shoes whats-their-names gorgeous dresses bridal regalia stylish accessories and smashing hats. (In one of the films few moments of cheerful unforced carnality Samantha smitten by the sight of a hunky beach-front neighbor plays Malibu peek-a-boo behind her floppy parasol-sized sombrero.) And love is what all four women have been seeking so it should come as welcome news that they find it or at least find self-love in healthy amounts. But the dramatic engine of the series was the blood-racing conflict between love and sex while the movie is animated -- barely -- by the heartstring-tugging conflict between love and no love. I wont say who ends up where (or how long the story stalls on the Mexican Riviera) but I will say that three of the four outcomes would not have been shockers in Eisenhower-era sitcoms. The film was written and directed by Michael Patrick King. Hes hardly a stranger to the characters or their storied life in the big city having been an award-winning writer producer and director on the show. Yet the storytelling sensibility has changed sometimes subtly and sometimes not. The city once a fantasy vision shared by four insiders has become a tourist attraction. (It doesnt help that Samantha shuttles back and forth between coasts.) The topical zingers that once crackled like static electricity (""Samantha had the sort of deluded self-confidence that caused men like Ross Perot to run for president"") have given way to mild remarks on familiar topics (""So this is where they keep the light"" says Chris Noths Mr. Big as he and Carrie on an apartment-hunting tour check out a sun-splashed penthouse) or to such high-suds banalities as one heroines cri de coeur ""You broke us What we had is broken"" Jennifer Hudson plays a new character a young woman named Louise. (From St. Louis. Who lusts after Louis Vuitton.) She shows up at a bad time in Carries life as an eager assistant who knows little about New York but understands the value of love. ""Saint Louise"" Carrie finally tells her gratefully ""you brought me back to life."" Thats true as far as it goes. When Louise arrives Carrie is so depressed that the light level in her bedroom has plummeted to ""Godfather"" levels. By the time she leaves Carrie is getting a new grip on a crucial aspect of her life -- yes him -- that was slipping away. And theres familiar life around her Charlottes domesticity Mirandas prickliness Samanthas lust. Its just that theres been an altitude adjustment -- fewer stilettos more flats. Ask what women want of a chick flick and one answer may be this -- a pleasant reunion with cherished friends. Ask what women deserve and the answer is better. The Edge of Heaven ENLARGE Nurgul Yesilcay in The Edge of Heaven. Strand Releasing Toward the end of ""The Edge of Heaven"" an exquisitely mysterious feature by the German-born Turkish filmmaker Fatih Akin a young man and an older woman meet at the intersection of coincidence and fate. (More precisely in Istanbul.) ""What shall we drink to?"" the man asks. ""To death"" the woman replies. She has her reasons. In a drama that uses intertitles to predict two deaths her daughter has been one of the casualties. Yet Mr. Akins film is so full of life that it leaves you breathless. The long arm of coincidence seems dominant at first for the plot evokes the intricate connections of ""Short Cuts"" ""Crash"" or ""Babel."" Im usually resistant to such films however clever they may be I cant help seeing them as mechanical constructions. But ""The Edge of Heaven"" is something new a narrative in which the convergences are intriguing but the gaps are haunting. Its not so much about how separate lives touch and interact as about lives that are changed and enriched by missed connections. Lest all of that sound vague let me hang some flesh on the abstractions. The story involves six people a Turkish widower in Germany; his son a university professor; a Turkish prostitute the old man brings into his home to keep him company; the prostitutes political-activist daughter; a young German woman she meets and falls in love with and the young womans mother. (The mother is played by Hanna Schygulla the star of so many Fassbinder films of the 1970s and 1980s. Her performance here is nothing less than sublime.) If I were to attempt a prose diagram of these characters comings goings and chance meetings youd never finish reading the review and far more important you wouldnt see the movie. Suffice it to say that they travel back and forth between Germany and Turkey (the dialogue is in German Turkish and English with good subtitles when needed) and sometimes trade places unwittingly. For all the intricacies of their itineraries though they follow an emotional logic thats as clear as any route in a Lonely Planet guide. ""The Edge of Heaven"" allows for the existence of good will and celebrates forgiveness with ineffable tenderness. Trust me on this one. Its a film that deserves to be seen. DVD Tip In its form and some of its content Fatih Akins phenomenal debut feature ""Head-On"" (2004) is a classic tale of immigrants (Turks in Germany) struggling to reconcile traditional values with the demands of assimilation. Essentially however its a love story in which the lovers behavior is wildly askew -- they meet in a psychiatric clinic -- while their binding passion makes perfect luminous sense.

A recent study found a link between teen pregnancy and steamy television shows.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. May 30 2008 Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis and Chris Noth. Written and directed by Michael Patrick King. 148 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  The first sex in the big-screen Sex and the City occurs near the half-hour mark as a tired wife groans ""get it over with"" to her frustrated husband.Article Continued BelowIts a relationship-altering event for the couple and also the moment where the movie - the heralded return of New York sizzle scribe Carrie Bradshaw and her tart trio of pals - stops being completely shallow and fashion obsessed and starts to get interesting.Not that theres anything wrong with being shallow and fashion-obsessed if frothy fun is your aim. Those who enjoyed the long-running TV series for its sitcom sex follies (with Ivana Trumps shoe budget) get oodles to ogle. Designer Patricia Field supplies upwards of 300 outfits each more outrageous than the last with stiletto shoes that are probably registered as dangerous weapons in some countries.For those whod like some substance in a movie pushing 2 1/2 hours though its gratifying to report that this Sex is more than just a fan dance. There are some serious life issues being worked on in between the heavy breathing and rampant consumerism.Credit must go to Michael Patrick King the series creative kingpin who wrote and directed the movie for giving this screen adaptation more heft than it needs to be a sure-fire hit. In fact it may be more serious than some would have wanted.The movie smartly picks up the threads the HBO series left dangling when it signed off four years ago. All the main players are back writer Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) sex-crazed Samantha (Kim Cattrall) sunny Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Mensa-minded Miranda (Cynthia Nixon). We learn through one of Carries trademark voiceovers that theyre no longer young women in their 20s and 30s seeking ""labels and love"" in Manhattan but mature women in their 40s (and beyond) who are negotiating the rocky shoals of life after singlehood.Heres the spoiler-free set-up since the trailer has already tipped as much Samantha has moved to California to manage the rising acting career of boytoy Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Charlotte and husband Harry (Evan Handler) are the proud parents of the daughter they adopted in China. Miranda and hubby Steve (David Eigenberg) are struggling to raise their young son while she juggles a demanding career.Then theres Carrie who is finally - and please hold those squeals - getting hitched to Mr. Big (Chris Noth) the zillionaire real estate mogul who has been shaking her bed but breaking her heart all these years. And Big isnt being small about the details the nuptials come with a Manhattan penthouse that costs the Earth and a custom-made closet that quakes Carrie to the core ""Now I believe this is really happening"" she coos.The movie fully indulges wedding fantasies both on and off the screen replete with the compulsory set pieces involving fashion shows shopping binges and confessional lunches - the latter made slightly less lewd by the presence of tots in tow.Candice Bergen returns in her hilarious cameo as the editor of Vogue who demands that Carrie pose for a photo spread as a fabulous 40s bride. The carrot she tells Carrie is not the Vogue photography but rather the ""Vogue air-brushing""Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) joins the cast as Carries new assistant teaching her boss how to scrimp when youve already blown the budget buying 300 throw cushions. Who knew that you could rent designer handbags?It should surprise no one theres a hitch or two in the wedding plans which connect with the life traumas of other members of Carries crew. (For those who are surprised by this news I recommend the consumption of a litre of chocolate Haagen-Dazs and viewing of the complete Sex and the City DVDs prior to heading to the multiplex.)What keeps the movie from being a feature-length ode to narcissism and greed is the genuine affection among the four women and the pain and confusion that resides within their Victorias Secret-clad bosoms - or sushi-draped bod in Samanthas unique circumstance.If theres a message in Sex and the City - and I admit this may be giving the movie way too much credit - its Samanthas perceptive observation that life isnt a box of Godiva chocolates ""Relationships arent always about being happy."" For those who want their Sex cheap and stupid fear not. There are plenty of moments where the superficial reigns supreme as in this supposedly serious exchange between two characters""You brought me back to life"" ""And you gave me Louis Vuitton"" But can I just say one thing?I hate Carries wedding outfit. The headdress makes her look like shes auditioning for the next X-Men sequel.Does this make me a bad person or just a shallow one?

Sex and the City (R) New Line (142 min.) Directed by Michael Patrick King. With Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis Cynthia Nixon. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Carrie Bradshaws jaw drops. Mr. Big beams. ""Oh my God"" she gasps. ""Oh ... Oh you did me proud"" ""Like it?"" he asks modestly. ""Love at first sight"" she exclaims. Yes true to his name the tall dark and handsome figure in Carries storied love life has given her what every woman dreams of A huge French-doored closet all her own with recessed lighting a lushly carpeted floor and shelves and shelves and shelves for all her shoes. It is part of the charm of ""Sex and the City"" that it knows how meretricious this all seems. It is a part of its problem that it doesnt care a bit. Years after the HBO sensation ended with a bang and a whimper the big-screen movie picks up the story again pumping it full of lavish production values and stretching it over nearly 21/2 hours. And to its credit it spends much of that time trying to tell a serious story about amorous disappointment. But then it nearly drowns it in hard-core consumerism. The money shots start early and never stop. Carrie and her three girlfriends do not apparently own a single pair of jeans sneakers or fuzzy slippers. What they do have -- all they have in fact -- are hats the size of cocktail tables heels the height of condos and wedding dresses whose trains require their own set of tracks. The nagging problem is that the whole thing is so overdone it becomes a distraction from the real relationship drama at the movies heart and ultimately an absurd joke. The three girlfriends show up to help Carrie pack -- in high-heels and designer frocks? They get together for a girls-only pajama party -- and sport marabou mules? When the TV show began that was part of its liberation-through-lingerie message. I am woman -- watch me wear sexy underwear (even when youre not around to see it). But that was then this is -- ow. No one wants ""Sex and the City"" to turn into ""The Grapes of Wrath"" -- and admitted ""guy flicks"" like the Bond movies indulge in their own product worship -- but times have painfully changed and suddenly self-absorption and 18 cocktails dont seem so cute. At least Depression-era rich-girl comedies like ""My Man Godfrey"" remembered the forgotten man; this one cant even remember to ask for the check. Of course the show always was as its characters snooty names proclaimed -- Carrie Bradshaw Charlotte York Miranda Hobbes Samantha Jones -- a walled bastion of privilege. Trying to open things up the movie makes room for Jennifer Hudson -- then cluelessly casts her as a saintly assistant who lives only to unpack Carries bags and clean up her emotional mess when things with Big sour. Hattie McDaniel you shall never die -- as long as Hollywood lives. Admitted diehard fans will undoubtedly enjoy the movie which carefully hits all the familiar notes. As the sex-obsessed Samantha Kim Cattrall remains the shallowest; as the demure Charlotte Kristin Davis is still the prettiest. Cynthia Nixon continues to be the best actress; Sarah Jessica Parker as demonstrated by the ubiquitous and worshipful shots of her in high heels and underwear the sleek and reverently proffered star. And there are of course the fashions -- fetishized shoes hip-high argyles and a bridal headpiece that seems to somehow incorporate a dead parrot. (Yes theres a wedding. No I dont dare tell you more -- the studio might have me fitted with a cement bolero jacket.) And there are a few mild in-jokes about Nixons out-of-the-closet revelations and Cattralls increasing age. For some that may be more than enough. Yet despite Carries dippy voiceovers -- now copied endlessly on every other hour-long TV drama -- instead of wit we get wish-fulfillment instead of self-examination we get self-pity. No one really changes. Everyone gets exactly what they want. And while all of that is pretty and shiny and glamorous its not really a movie. Its a clothes catalog that talks. Rating note The film contains full-frontal nudity sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Kim Cattrall Sarah Jessica Parker Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis in a scene from ""Sex and the City The Movie. Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 5 2008 248 PM Sex and the City The heroines of HBOs romantic dramedy hit the big screen. With Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis Cynthia Nixon. Directed by Michael Patrick King (222). R Sexuality nudity language. ""My name is Carrie Bradshaw"" announces narrator Sarah Jessica Parker at the start of the ""Sex and the City"" movie and its safe to say there has never been a more superfluous phrase in cinematic history.No we havent seen ""SATCs"" leading lady since HBOs beloved series ended four years ago. But is there an audience member alive who wont recognize her the second she sets a well-shod foot onscreen? The best reunions begin with nostalgia and end with hope for the future and ""SATC"" is bursting with both. An amusing introduction catches us up on Carrie and her cohorts - Samantha (Kim Cattrall) Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) - making it clear that the more things change the more we all miss the old Meatpacking District. Just like the show the movie is unabashedly enamored of what Carrie calls ""the two Ls labels and love."" But what really makes this story run is an F-word - and no Samantha fans its not that one. The movies beating heart is the friendship between the women who had found some sort of happiness by the shows 2004 finale. Now theyre all at a personal crossroads and need one another more than ever. While Miranda and Steve (David Eigenberg) are still in Brooklyn marital bliss remains beyond their reach. Charlotte is facing an unexpected adjustment to life with her husband (Evan Handler) and adopted daughter. Samantha has made the biggest change having moved to L.A. to manage the career of boy toy Smith (Jason Lewis). Her current problem? Retaining an ever-shaky state of monogamy. As for Carrie shes written several successful books on affairs of the heart while settling in with her own true love John James Preston. Yep thats his name though he and Carrie have been together so long she rarely calls Big (Chris Noth) by his nickname anymore. In fact theyre not only looking at apartments together theyre talking marriage. But the closer Carrie comes to the big day the colder her fiances feet get. Without ruining any details lets just say his prenuptial panic shines a spotlight on everyones problems. The only one who stays calm in fact is Carries twenty-something assistant Louise (Jennifer Hudson) who possesses the same romantic naivete our ladies held when the series started a decade ago. Theyre all over 40 now and writer/director Michael Patrick King deftly balances their hard-won wisdom with the wistful dreams they still share. At the same time theres plenty of fun to be had especially with costume designer Patricia Field on board. There are no less than three fashion shows and while the best takes place in Carries closet the movie makes delightful use of its entire city setting. Of course no love affair runs entirely smoothly and given all thats packed into the 142-minute running time there will be moments when your passion cools. Most notably while Hudson rises above the demeaning nature of her role she shouldnt have to. And perpetually bitter Miranda feels disappointingly one-dimensional in both the way shes written and played. But if weve learned anything from ""SATC"" its that hope is always around the corner. A cupcake (or new coat) can ease almost any crisis. When it comes to Big Carrie will never - nope sorry. Itd take a truckload of cosmos to get me to reveal any more than that. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Sex and the City (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Sex and the City (R)  The lumbering movie version of HBOs Sex and the City turns out to be more disappointment than joyful reunion. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as ""Carrie Bradshaw"" and Chris Noth stars as ""Mr. Big"" in New Line Cinemas Sex and the City. PhotoCraig Blankenhorn/New Line Cinema. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald The Vivienne Westwood wedding gown is gorgeous as are the pivotal Manolo Blahniks. Mirandas softer hairstyle is extremely flattering and there are enough What is she wearing? moments to please the most dedicated fan of extreme fashion. But the lumbering movie version of HBOs Sex and the City turns out to be more disappointment than joyful reunion a tedious and desperately drawn-out affair that tests your patience even as it brazenly courts (and often earns) your contempt. Stretching a 30-minute TV show into a longer-than-average feature-length film is always a mistake of course as is assuming that SATC fans will blithely enjoy any random arrangement of dramatic and comedic moments so long as they involve shopping couture break-ups make-ups and hot naked guys. The story such as it is picks up three years after the series ended with our heroines paired off with husbands or boyfriends all in or near NYC except for Samantha (Kim Cattrall) who has moved to L.A. with gorgeous actor Smith (Jason Lewis). She flies into town every other day though so its all good. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Big (Chris Noth) are looking for a place to live. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Steve (David Eigenberg) are sparring as usual and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Harry (Evan Handler) are blissfully happy with their adopted Chinese daughter. We learn there will be a wedding and a Vogue shoot. Carrie wears a bird on her head. Excellent. But then the break-ups begin. We are treated to more shopping several pointless and increasingly annoying fashion montages and more feminine squealing than can be healthy for anyone. If my friends shrieked this much every time they laid eyes on me Id have them Baker Acted. Even more disconcerting is the girl-power road trip to Mexico which seems to exist solely for the benefit of a lame diarrhea joke. Also in that vein is a series of humping-dog gags that have apparently wandered onscreen straight from an Adam Sandler movie. SATC has never been known for sophisticated humor but its raunchy banter has always been delicious and invigorating. A humping dog makes 10-year-old boys laugh not grown women with eyes for Louis Vuitton. But then thats another problem with SATC Its self-indulgent showing us scenes of the girls as they hit Fashion Week merely because the production budget is big enough to allow them to be there. Maybe the weakened economy is affecting me or I grew weary of the shopping porn but this grasping consumption is off-putting in a way it never was on TV. Maybe theres simply too much of what used to be a good thing. Worst of all though is the evisceration of Carrie and Mr. Big. Americas favorite rich white-guy playa dithers like a nervy schoolgirl and even at one point -- brace yourself -- recites poetry. Hes de-Bigged. His behavior is so out of character that it compromises our affection for Carrie. Despite Parkers considerable grace and charm our beloved Carrie no longer is someone we really want to hang out with. Writer/director Michael Patrick King may think women watched the TV show to daydream about acquiring things a new bag a new apartment a man. But though the shoes are nice we responded to a different fantasy That we might always have time for our best friends and long talks and Cosmos that well always be close despite busy lives. SATC is best when it realizes that fact A concerned Carrie traipsing out through the snow on New Years Eve to comfort a weepy Miranda is the films emotional highlight. Still Willie Garson who plays Carries gay friend Stanford was right when he said during a red carpet interview that SATC was a critic-proof film. Loyal fans will flock to the theaters to see their heroes no matter what they read in reviews. Its a shame the filmmakers didnt give them a film thats the perfect fit for their devotion.

On the other hand why revisit New York and its fabulous foursome after the series 2004 finale seemed to wrap up any lingering emotional strings? The answer to that is the shows devotees desperately wanted to know what became of the 30-something women who visited their living rooms for six seasons. It was like the need to look up an old friend on Facebook or Google an ex. The film is by no means a masterpiece but its a worthy exercise in indulgence that wont disappoint the cosmo-swilling core audience. And fans wont need to swill any cosmos to enjoy it. The movie picks up four years after the series left off and the characters current predicaments seem to come as a surprise to no one but themselves. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) the relationship long ago consummated but the knot left untied. And they live in separate apartments. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is struggling to balance her demanding legal career with her family. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is raising her adopted daughter with adorable husband Harry (Evan Handler) but still wishes to conceive. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) continues to grapple with monogamy in Los Angeles where she manages boyfriend Smiths (Jason Lewis) acting career. The 21/2-hour film doesnt try to cram in unnecessary plot twists or illogical developments to set it apart from the series. Charlotte doesnt suddenly become a paralegal in Mirandas firm (with hilarious results) and Carrie doesnt up and decide to run for Congress. Its all the expected puns and pathos and - given how well audiences know these characters - theres a fair amount of predictability. The movie retains all the quick wit of the show and certain sights and soundbites still will elicit gasps and chuckles. It all feels remarkably familiar and in this case thats not a bad thing. Of course the scope here is larger encompassing not only New York but also Samanthas enviable beachside real estate in Los Angeles and a brief trip to Mexico. The fashion is amped up as well notably on Miranda. Each scene is jam-packed with eye candy including two unforgettable montages that will leave fans and fashionphiles talking. (Well see how long it is before women start emulating Carries newfound habit of wearing pearls to bed.) With the fired-up fashion focus the designer name-checking increases as well. Its not as bothersome as some early reviews of the film would have you believe. These names - Wang Westwood Blahnik - are part of these womens world and it just wouldnt seem right without them. The actresses also seem to embrace the new medium. Parker alternately sparkles and wears her Maxim magazine-branded ""unsexiest woman title like a badge of honor. She allows the camera to capture her in ways that are so unflattering - and yet so real - that Carries heartache is clear on her face. Though the movies main focus is on the Carrie-Big relationship its Mirandas journey that feels the most textured. Nixon plays both frazzled and frail equally well and she pushes Mirandas story to the forefront. Cattrall and Davis who bring the camp and cutesy respectively feel a bit like second fiddles. Its these two however who supply the films most memorable moments. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson of American Idol and Dreamgirls fame is a welcome addition as Carries assistant and finally adds the much-needed racial diversity that was embarrassingly lacking from the series. Unfortunately shes back in a role shes grown accustomed to simple girl who gets a taste of the glamorous life. But shes sweet and a welcome shot of wide-eyed youth that freshens up the story of the (gasp) pushing-40 foursome. Theres still something missing though. With the word ""sex in the title theres not enough of the actual act (or the series trademark chitchat about doing the deed) to make the movie as devilishly fun. Also missing is Carrie working on one of her signature columns which provided a narrative thread that often kept the stories focused. Here the lessons are not so clear and without that clear context the film seems a little more flimsy by comparison. Its a movie all about plot a Where Are They Now? for fans. Ultimately the appeal of Sex and the City depends on movie goers relationship with the series. If youre just getting introduced the film wont be the spark that makes you fall in love. For those who really cared about the show the ladies and the city theres plenty of ""zsa zsa zu here to be had. bobby.hankinsonchron.com Todays Deals Keter Manor 4x6-Foot Storage Shed for 339 + pickup at Walmart Fredericks of Hollywood Sale and Clearance Up to 77% off +...

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 31 2008 Save for later Saved To put it mildly I am not an aficionado of the HBO TV series ""Sex and the City."" For all I know Manolo Blahnik could be the name of a toreador from Latvia. This qualifies me as either the best or the worst person to review the new movie.But connoisseurship is a much overrated quality in critics so Ill make the case here that by approaching this material fresh - i.e. as someone who has never attended a ""viewing party"" for the TV show - Im giving it the fairest of shakes.Still you have to wonder Do even SATC fanatics crave a glorified TV episode and a rather middling one at that? The TVs shows creative honcho writer-director Michael Patrick King has called this 2-1/2-hour movie ""The Lord of the Engagement Rings."" Im not sure hes being ironic. It reportedly features over 300 makeovers among the four female leads. (Does that include all those strappy sandals?) At times the movie resembled nothing so much as Kabuki with Cosmos. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? King kicks off the movie with uncharacteristically fast-paced updates. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is back from Paris and big with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) with whom shes scouting a Fifth Avenue penthouse (her fantasy aerie his money). Overworked Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is ensconced in Brooklyn with her guilt-ridden (dont ask) husband Steve (Dave Eigenberg) and young son. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Sex and the City Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is guilt-ridden because she and her loving hubby Harry (Evan Handler) and adopted baby girl from China are so well - happy. (Even more good stuff happens to her in the course of the movie. Whats a poor girl to do?)Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has conquered her cancer and heads up a talent agency in Los Angeles where she handles if thats the right word her hunky live-in boyfriend Smith (Jason Lewis). She has a difficult time committing to one man - even one who appears to have been chiseled by Rodin - and is forever flying to New York to provide aid and comfort and costume changes.Theres also a welcome new addition Jennifer Hudson as Carries gal Friday. Shes younger than the leading ladies (thats good for audience demographics) and African-American (previously the show was whiter than an ice floe).Thanks to the shows huge following and its lucrative afterlife on DVD and in syndication SATC still has its rabid followers. It is even heaven help us iconic. Artifacts from the show are housed in the Smithsonian. But is it such a big deal anymore to hear women talk about sex as crudely as men do? This was always a prime reason for the TV shows bond-a-thon appeal - this and all the hearts and flowers that the cast threw at each other.The series functioned primarily as a giddy foul-mouthed soap opera for women over 30; it was lapped up as a liberation from good taste. But there was nothing especially feminist about the show. (And yes I caught up with some old episodes OK?) The same is true of the movie. The SATC universe is indubitably man-centric.The commercial success of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is largely the reason this movie was made. (An attempt four years ago was sunk by contractual disputes.) Its wonderful that films specifically for and about women are being made - especially women over 30 which in Hollywood years is something like 80. But the inevitable (I think) success of SATC will likely just lead to SATC II and assorted knockoffs.Still as gender-segregated experiences go SATC is preferable to say that idiotic beefcake epic ""300."" The amusing thing about SATC is that it objectifies - fetishizes - men in much the same way that most male-oriented movies objectify women. This is poetic or prosaic justice indeed. Maybe one day both sides of the gender gap can meet in the middle and distinguish each other as you know human.In the meantime can someone please explain to me what that thing is called on Carries head that looks like a butterfly-encrusted corsage trapped in a terrarium?

"Sex and the City reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sex and the City reviewed. Sex and the City reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 29 2008 628 PM Sex and the City A guilty pleasure thats truly guilty. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Julia Turner argues that the films sartorial priorities were out of whack and Lesley M.M. Blume squelches dreams of a Sex and the City The Movie cash cow. Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City. Sex and the City (New Line) written and directed by Michael Patrick King opens with a voice-over paean from Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) to the supposed twin aspirations of all New York women ""labels and love."" Over the course of the movies two and a half hours the central female foursome will wax cynical then hopeful then ambivalent then tentatively hopeful again about the possibility of finding love. But their faith in labels will never budge. No real-life relationship Carrie and her cohorts reluctantly concede can live up to the impossible expectations our culture places on romantic love. But luxury commodities? Those are more than capable of fulfilling every fantasy. The right Louis Vuitton bag--hell any Louis Vuitton bag--can change your life. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Drop the title Sex and the City into a conversation especially among women and youre unlikely to elicit a neutral shrug. During the shows six-year run on HBO people I knew either attended reverently irreverent Sunday-night viewing parties or felt for the remote at the first notes of that vibraphone theme song. For me the series functioned as a guilty pleasure that was truly guilty I would rent a few episodes on DVD on nights when I was home alone and not up to the intellectual challenge of watching a good movie. The shows values are reprehensible its view of gender relations cartoonish its puns execrable. I honestly believe as I wrote when the series finale aired in 2004  that Sex and the City is singlehandedly responsible for a measurable uptick in the number of materialistic twits in New York City and perhaps the world. And yet ... and yet ... theres a core truth to the shows depiction of female friendship that had me awaiting the big-screen version with exactly the kind of cream-puff nostalgia the movies marketers are bargaining for. I want to know how the girls are doing whats happened to them in the four years since I last joined them at brunch and what in the name of God theyre wearing. Advertisement Addressing the wardrobe question would require a separate cross-referenced concordance; let me just note that along the way there are toeless hose rubber epaulets pasties made of sushi and a headdress shaped like a bird. But heres an update on the ladies whereabouts Sexually voracious Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is living in Los Angeles  managing the career of her model/boyfriend Smith (Jason Lewis) and chafing under the strain of monogamy. Perpetually cranky lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) lives in Brooklyn (anachronistically treated as a backwater rather than the real-estate hot spot its become) with her nerdy husband Steve (David Eigenberg) and their son. Perky Charlotte (Kristin Davis in top screwball form) is almost laughably happy with her husband Harry (Evan Handler) and their adopted daughter. None of these women are hurting for either money or male attention but Carrie has hit the jackpot Shes landed her long-elusive lover superrich financier Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and published three best-sellers with titles like Menhattan. (The movie is mercifully light on those self-searching Carrie-at-the-computer scenes that were one of the series recurring disappointments Why did she have to be such a bad writer?) Big effortlessly picks up the tab for a vast Fifth Avenue penthouse and makes plans to move in with Carrie. But sensing the fragility of their union--this is the man who made her his personal yo-yo for six years--she pushes tentatively for marriage. I dont think its giving away too much to say that what follows includes a shopping montage to end all shopping montages as Carrie poses in one couture wedding gown after another for a Vogue photographer (In one of the movies crasser concessions to product placement she names each designer in a voice-over.) And--tiptoeing gingerly around further possibilities for spoilage--Ill also add that what happens when she finally dons the winning gown on the big day is genuinely and believably awful (even if the director milks it for pathos in an unforgivably corny slo-mo shot). Its impossible to address the movies principal failing--the way it insists on both having and eating the Cinderella-themed cake of romantic fulfillment--without revealing more than that. So Ill stick to the good bits Carrie camping it up in a succession of outfits as her friends help her winnow down her wardrobe for a move by holding up signs that read ""take"" or ""toss."" (In real life Carries narcissism would make her a terrible friend but Sarah Jessica Parker makes bottomless self-absorption look like such fun.) Miranda wrecking the rehearsal dinner in a moment of ill-timed honesty. Charlottes righteous transformation into a protective lioness when her friend is mistreated--a moment whose high drama Davis skillfully leavens by proceeding to prance offscreen with a ridiculous mincing gait. The movies initially brisk pacing slackens when the girls spend a holiday in Mexico thats long enough for them to cycle through an entire resort-wear collection. Samantha disappears entirely for stretches and her story arc contains some of the movies most painfully unfeminist jokes (in which we learn for example that vigilant pubic grooming and toned abs are essential to female self-esteem). And an attempt to address the series endemic whiteness by adding a subaltern black character--Jennifer Hudson as Carries designer-bag-toting Girl Friday--is a major misfire that only underscores our heroines oblivious entitlement. But if you bear even a grudging affection for the showsutopic vision of female bonding as the greatest love of all you may get choked up when Carrie appears at Mirandas door one shitty New Years Eve (clad only in pajamas a sequined cloche a full-length fur and what appear to be patent-leather spats) and reassures her friend ""Youre not alone."" Correction May 30 2008 This article originally stated that Sex and the City the TV series ended in 2005. It ended in 2004. (Return to the corrected sentence.)

NFL season Fans give Morneau loud return to Target Field Midwest Traveler Exploring the revived Eau Claire Wis. next Movies 19356779 Movie review Sex and the City uncorks desires nostalgia Its a little darker in this ""City"" for our four favorite fashionistas.  | out of 4 stars May 29 2008 -- 437pm Handout photo ""Sex and the City The Movie"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Four years after ending their run on HBO the ""Sex and the City"" girls are back still slim as their stiletto heels and pretty as a pink cocktail even though theyre heading into their fifth and sixth decades. The movie scripted and directed by series veteran Michael Patrick King caters to viewers nostalgic for the Emmy-winning show while pushing forward into feature film territory. It begins where the final episode concluded then leads its four fashionistas into darker territory giving the fizzy goings-on some dramatic heft. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) who has graduated from being a relationship columnist to a bestselling author is still in a committed relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Theyre moving into a penthouse the size of a football field. Samantha sexually ravenous as ever is living in Malibu with her actor/client/boy-toy Smith (Jason Lewis). Shes chafing under the yoke of monogamy as she eyes their hunky neighbor. Life is even more onerous for tense Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) balancing a high-stress law practice an unfulfilling marriage to bartender Steve (David Eigenberg) and the demands of motherhood in Brooklyn. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) has a charmed life with a glorious Park Avenue apartment adoring hubby Harry (Evan Handler) and their adopted Chinese daughter. SEX AND THE CITY  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content graphic nudity and language. When Carrie suggests that she and Big consider marriage now that they will be cohabiting and all he casually replies ""I wouldnt mind being married to you."" The engagement of ""the ultimate single gal"" makes the newspaper gossip columns and Carrie is featured in a Vogue fashion spread as a mature bride who comes in just under the threshold of ""the unintended Diane Arbus subtext."" But as the wedding day nears tensions intervene phone messages go awry and complications multiply. Carrie spends most of the films middle section in a depressive funk. While the quippy dialogue doesnt rival the TV shows candid sexual chatter theres a fair dose of porn in this helping of ""Sex."" Theres textile porn with dozens of costume changes for the ladies a montage of Parker in wedding gowns by top designers and a front-row view of phantasmagorical fashions at a runway show. Theres dwelling porn with loving shots of Carries new closet which is big enough to land a Piper Cub. Theres product porn as name-brand coffee shoes handbags and accessories parade across the screen. Actual sex however is in short supply. Miranda and Steve have a revealing bedroom scene Samantha peeps as her well-endowed neighbor showers and serves herself up as a naked sushi platter and Carrie and Big have a fully clothed encounter that leaves them glowing with post-coital bliss. There are a couple of scenes that help the film earn its R but theyre more comic than steamy. The randiest character onscreen is a pet pooch in perpetual heat. As on the series the acting is all over the place. Parker and Nixon make their characters grief feel quite real. Catrall does her stagy Mae West impression as capably as ever and Davis does all shes ever been asked to do Pop her eyes wide and act chirpy. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours the film doesnt add new layers of complexity to the leads and stints on attention to secondary characters; the gay men Stanford (Willie Garson) and Anthony (Mario Cantone) flit through the film in a blink. Carries marital mishaps are the main story line but there are arcs for the other three principals as well and the film feels padded. A subplot introducing Jennifer Hudson (""Dreamgirls"") as Carries assistant doesnt do much to advance the plot but it adds a touch of variety to the films white-on-white demographics. A side trip to a Mexican resort seems to exist solely to set up a diarrhea joke. If it were 20 minutes trimmer ""Sex and the City"" would be considerably better. Writer/director King should have remembered the classic fashion advice When you think youre well dressed take something off.

When one needs help - to mend a broken heart to move out of a cluttered apartment - unfailingly the others are available clad smartly in couture frocks and strappy heels that cost more than your monthly mortgage payment.We should hate them for overconsumption. We dont mostly because theyre loving loveable witty and about as realistic as Barbie.If they had a motto it would be Label clothes not people. (Product placement alert From Chanel to Diane von Furstenberg there are more labels here than at a winery.)Three years or so have elapsed since Manhattan working gals Carrie Charlotte Miranda and Samantha last clinked cocktail glasses. For those unfamiliar with them - and is that anyone watching this movie? - their back stories are telegraphed during a briskly-paced opening-credits sequence.Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) the urban anthropologist has graduated from newspaper columnist to successful nonfiction author - ""three books in three years"" - keeping company with financier ""Mr. Big"" (Chris Noth). As Carrie regards the arrangements of her friends she and Big contemplate marriage.Chirpy Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and moody Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) represent marital ying and yang one a stay-at-home mom enjoying wedded bliss the other a working mother enduring marital blitz. Saucy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has moved to Malibu where she manages the career of (and is faithful to) her much-younger beau Smith (Jason Lewis).The clothes shoes and handbags not to mention the baubles and bangles are seductive eye candy equivalent to the cars and gadgets in a James Bond movie. These amount to haute couture trimmings on writer/director Michael Patrick Kings Cinderella reweave.When Carrie reads the fairy taleto Charlottes daughter she recognizes the source of her longings for the perfect shoe and the perfect Prince. And ruefully acknowledges how Cinderella has programmed her with unrealistic expectations for perfection in footwear and men.Less a stand-alone movie than a new 140-minute mini-season of the HBO series Sex shows how each of the four friends embrace imperfection rewriting the fairy tale to better fit her own life.The four women couldnt be better - or better matched. As always Parker is the standout cracking your heart and cracking you up with equal ease.King is a snappier writer than filmmaker letting the actresses their clothes and the sparkling Manhattan locations carry the visuals.As Carries personal assistant a kind of cyber-housekeeper Jennifer Hudson (Effie of Dreamgirls) is the new addition. Sunny and sincere her casting brings to mind Hattie McDaniels line that for blacks better to play a maid than be a maid. Though Hudsons character is never truly part of Sexs sorority her inclusion at least brings a note of real-world diversity.Sex and the Citys three flavors of woman - Bridezilla Mom and Cougar - does not mark significant progress from Hollywoods typical options of witch and sex kitten but its one choice more.And admittedly Carrie Bradshaws ambition to have a walk-in closet of her own is definitely a regression a 21st century downsizing from Virginia Woolfs room of her own. But the closet Carrie gets is a lulu larger than many Manhattan apartments and with finishes ordinarily found in royal villas.Finally what matters most to Carrie and company isnt getting and spending but the getting of wisdom and spending time together. After six seasons on television they gracefully make the transition to the big screen and the pleasure of their company remains contagious fun.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Fashionably later - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Fashionably later Four years on the City girls are still in vogue Dressed for Sexcess The show that made Sarah Jessica Parker a fashion icon inspired women to take sartorial chances. D2 (Craig Blankenhorn/New Line Cinema) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 29 2008 For a year Ive been convinced that if I wanted to win certain womens hearts all I had to do was pop the question ""Will you see Sex and the City with me?"" Frequently one of these women will stop me just to ask ""Have you seen it?"" - always with a look of ecstasy and desperation on her face. They need their fix of Carrie Miranda Charlotte and Samantha. Many of these entertainment-deprived women are planning wild nights on the town - as foursomes obviously. Theres a touching irony to it all. Theyre going to the movies to watch TV.The HBO series which ran from 1998 to 2004 is at the megaplex now and at 2 hours and 15 minutes its like going to somebody elses house to binge on a stack of new episodes surrounded by a bunch of girlfriends you dont know. Written and directed by the shows co-creator Michael Patrick King the movie is just like a half-season of the series - a funny sappy clumsy crude rambunctious argumentative gleefully vulgar attempt to balance the fantasy of romance with the reality that the fantasy is impossible.Its full of bad puns some good quotable jokes and filmmaking thats often only a notch above ""Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay."" The film is set four years after the show ended and King hasnt taken any real artistic leaps forward. Too often the movie feels like a prolonged episode with the complexity the series offered merely simplified. To Kings credit he hasnt completely succumbed to self-congratulatory camp either.The series strength was never visual or structural. It was emotional and observational. At its very best ""Sex and the City"" was the closest any work of popular culture has come to capturing the social vicissitudes in Edith Whartons fiction. The writing may not have been as good but the class and gender perceptions relationship critiques and real sense of life in New York City felt like pure Wharton. The tangle of wishfulness and practicality in the authors heroines found natural 21st century extensions in the 30-something women (plus the older Samantha) that King the series creator Darren Star and a handful of perceptive writers kept at the vanguard of Manhattan social life.Not even in 135 minutes can King do that - for one thing Manhattan the shows fifth heroine never truly comes to life. But the movie has its moments. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) the shows chic centerpiece dating columnist and shoe fanatic is considering marriage to Mr. Big (Chris Noth) the man who for a decade has been both the love of her life and a romantic albatross. The series ended with him declaring his undying love in Paris. Now they may tie the knot - but for practical reasons. He wants to buy them a penthouse but Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) ever the lawyer instructs Carrie not to sell her current place without some kind of equity in the new one. Marriage would seem to solve that problem. But what begins as a simple quiet ceremony snowballs into an event. The news winds up on Page Six in the New York Post and Carries editor at Vogue (Candice Bergen) wants to turn the nuptials into a story about ""the last single woman."" (Where? In the universe?) The impending wedding gives virtuous Charlotte (Kristin Davis) the character who most scrupulously believes in fairy tales something to help plan and it momentarily freaks out Samantha (Kim Cattrall) the former bed-faring adventurer whos moved to Los Angeles with her movie-star boyfriend (Jason Lewis) but comes back to New York as if the trip were as simple as hopping in a cab.The wedding only occupies the films first hour. What time remains requires the women to do a lot of soul-searching and slapstick. I could have lived without Samanthas pillow-humping purse dog. But Cattrall herself is still a carnal wonder and as verbally sharp as ever. Davis is very funny waddling around in a tight dress and a tighter scatological jam. And Parker is every bit the romantic-comedy princess the show made of her although I truly miss her throwaway dips into ghetto-fabulous diction and vocabulary. (In some episodes Carrie could have passed for the token black friend. Now its an uncomfortable-looking Jennifer Hudson who plays Carries stylish personal assistant.)Nixon has the hardest job. Ive always admired her willingness to be the bearer of ugly truths. Here she has to find some way to inhabit Mirandas severity without letting the character succumb completely to bitterness. And for the most part she does.Of course ""Sex and the City"" features lots of changes of clothing; Parker wears five different outfits before the opening credits have even finished. Sometimes the conspicuous consumption and chronic fabulousness is absurd. The girls help Carrie pack her apartment in dresses and heels; even in the series somebody owned a pair of jeans.The film may be compensating for the woeful lack of glamour coming from Hollywood movies where women as I know them are an endangered species. As Carrie and company evolved in the series into real emotionally rich characters a lot of women saw beyond the 1000 dresses and 600 shoes and glimpsed themselves. Thats not an identification the movies are able - make that willing - to produce terribly often.Yet while ""Sex and the City"" fills a void in that respect its a void the series itself helped to create. The show brought serious romantic comedy (and sometimes drama) to television at a time when it was stagnating on the big screen. Consequently the movies had a hard time competing with the vast emotional universe an ongoing series could convey opening a way for the television writer-producer Judd Apatow to repopulate the genre in movie theaters with amusingly needy heterosexual men. The boyfriends and husbands are made to seem just as pathetic in the ""Sex and the City"" movie which makes the emotional entanglements and disentanglements look easier on screen than they did on TV. The men never put up a fight over anything and the movie puts fantasy ahead of reality. For the moment King has restored women to their rightful place in a genre that is nothing without them. But sadly that genre isnt romantic comedy. Its the chick flick.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The characters have changed in that instant with Charlotte growing into the role of outgoing protector and Carrie needing protection. And yet its just that a fleeting moment a throwaway. Which sets it apart from nearly everything else in the film almost all of which is simply overdone. From the running time - nearly 2 hours enough for five episodes - to the plot development for each character which grows to beating-a-dead-horse lengths in at least a couple of cases the whole thing would have been better served by holding back a little. Its all too much. Of course if youre a fan of the show too much is never enough. Much like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Sex and the City is a well-made shout-out to the faithful. Its not bad by any means; its often funny and sometimes moving. But theres nothing here to justify the leap from HBO to the big screen other than a devoted fan base that doubtless will follow it. All the key ingredients are still here Four women in New York searching for love happiness and fashion not necessarily in that order. I dont know all there is to know about fashion but by the end of the movie every designer label Ive ever heard of is name-dropped. You hear people say about certain films things like ""The city is another character."" In this case handbags are. (Thats not a joke.) As the movie starts time has passed roughly the same amount (four years) since the show left TV. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is married to Steve (David Eigenberg) living with him and their son in Brooklyn. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Harry (Evan Handler) are happily ensconced on Park Avenue with their daughter. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is living in California with Smith (Jason Lewis) taking care of his career and watching their handsome neighbor have nearly constant sex (everyone needs a hobby). And Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) her writing career still going strong has landed a dream apartment with Big (Chris Noth). Thats the happy version. The downside to all this seeming bliss is that Miranda is an overtaxed overbooked overburdened working mother (a fact she manages to work into just about every sentence she speaks). Charlotte is afraid of happiness waiting for her bubble to burst. Samantha always the most brutally honest of the group isnt fulfilled making anyone the center of her life except herself. And Carrie isnt married. But thats about to change. She and Big decide to tie the knot - pretty much just like that a mutual decision made with all the romantic flair of hammering out a business contract. The event takes on a life of its own growing far beyond the smallish tasteful affair the couple originally conceived. Complications ensue of course. As they do elsewhere. Each womans plotline gets at least some service with the film moving from one to another as a TV episode might from week to week. Jennifer Hudson is brought in as Louise hired by Carrie as a personal assistant but shes the only new addition of note. On hand from the show are such favorites as Carries pal Stanford Blanch (Willie Garson) Charlottes wedding planner Anthony Marentino (Mario Cantone); and Carries Vogue editor Enid Frick (Candice Bergen). Cattrall and Noth have the most fun. In Cattralls case thats no surprise - she still gets the bawdiest lines and delivers them with a certain smug satisfaction that suits her. Noth retains a reserved air of bemusement as if hes watching the proceedings from a distance even as hes in the middle of them. Its a shame to see Nixon whose portrayal of Miranda was in many ways the most complex in the series reduced to a one-note whiner. By the end all the individual dramas are wrapped up neatly for the most part. Another movie could come out tomorrow and not much explanation about what has happened to the characters would be necessary; a quick catch-up like the one used in this film would do. Carrie Miranda Charlotte and Samantha will no matter what happens still be there for one another. A noble thought and by this time pretty much a given. But what makes that - and by extension the Sex and the City movie different from the TV show? Nothing. And perhaps thats the point.

Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis Kim Cattrall and Chris Noth. Directed by Michael Patrick King. (R. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Fans of ""Sex and the City"" will love the movie version. Like the HBO series that gave birth to it the movie is lots of fun but its no frivolous romp. The shows great ambition always present becomes even more pronounced in the movie - to document the emotional life and values of cosmopolitan women of a particular generation. Its as if its creators realized the series significance over the course of its run and that shift in the direction of importance - subtle but definite - continues with this movie. Under the levity theres a core seriousness about presenting these womens lives one emphasized by the willingness of ""Sex and the City"" to grow and mature along with its characters. Those who know these characters will of course pick up on nuances and associations that novices will miss. Yet even viewers coming in cold will appreciate ""Sex and the City"" as the best American movie about women so far this year and probably the best that will be made this year. Indeed at the rate Hollywood has been going it may stand as the best womens movie until ""Sex and the City II"" if that ever comes along. Coming in Michael Patrick King the movies writer-director had two difficult tasks He had to introduce the characters to a new audience without irritating fans of the show and he had to take a series that ended perfectly and un-end it without seeming arbitrary. He knocks off the first task easily (re-)introducing the principals during a credits sequence narrated by the main character Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) a best-selling author in New York City. Theres Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) a successful publicist with a ravenous sexual appetite. Theres Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) a gentle princess-like wife and mother. And theres Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) a lawyer and buttoned-down cynic living in Brooklyn with her husband and son. Un-ending the perfectly ended series takes a little more time. For the first 10 minutes or so the movie hovers in place emphasizing (and for first-timers introducing) the status quo. But then the gears gradually move into place. Four years have passed. Carrie is still seeing ""Mr. Big"" - whose name is now revealed to be John James Preston (Chris Noth) - and the two decide to get married. This soon turns into plans for the fashion marriage of the century with a guest list of 200 and a gown by Vivienne Westwood. But of course things cant happen too smoothly. Meanwhile Samantha is dissatisfied with her life in Los Angeles even though she is still in love with her much-younger boyfriend Smith (Jason Lewis) and Miranda and her impossibly sweet husband Steve (David Eigenberg) are having marriage trouble. Though the laughs are frequent and the movie sparkles with glitz and fashion an air of middle-aged disappointment is sometimes present a realization of limits of having to choose between imperfect options. Suddenly the women are most definitely in their 40s and so their interaction with younger women is different sometimes long-suffering sometimes almost motherly. Carrie takes on a personal assistant (Jennifer Hudson whos charming) and gives her sisterly advice the hard-earned wisdom of 20 years in the New York trenches. The mature vibe shows that ""Sex and the City"" is elastic and capable of bringing in new elements of womens experience. It clocks in at a hefty 145 minutes but all that means is that its like watching five episodes of the TV show in succession. Think of it not as a long movie but as the equivalent of an entire TV season muscled into one big megadose. The allotment of screen time never seems obviously apportioned but each actress gets a chance to shine. Charlottes life is the most stable in this installment but Davis has some of the best comic moments and Cattrall shows a slight mellowing (and a definite deepening) in Samantha. As Miranda Nixon is just brilliant presenting her as someone increasingly locked into the patterns of her own personality less hopeful and verging on bitterness. At the same time underneath it shes painfully sensitive. Parker is lovely alive to every nuance of feeling her face the films locus of meaning. Her lack of vanity is becoming. When Carrie gets beaten up emotionally Parker allows herself to look beat up. In ones 40s a person doesnt take an emotional beating and wake up the next morning looking as fresh as a 20-year-old. Parker lets us see Carries and her own true face. Theres something alive here. Theres a feeling about this movie that its not some perfunctory cinematic appendix to a popular series but the beginning of a whole new string of films. Theres certainly no artistic reason ""Sex and the City"" cant be the womens equivalent of ""Star Trek"" with human emotion being the final frontier. Like outer space that frontier is infinite. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and nudity.

SEX AND THE CITY RETURNSNaked guy actually quite modestChris Noth Sex reunion was Big funSex-y guys Ladies leading men speak upCynthia Nixon Well hello there MirandaReview Sex as familiar as a favorite shoePremiere An otherworldly timeMore  SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE HEADLINES FROM PEOPLE.COM By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its an unabashed guilty pleasure that goes down as smoothly as a chilled cosmo. Fans of the HBO series are sure to enjoy the reunion of the fab four in Sex and the City The Movie ( out of four) who remain glamorous and guy-obsessed. SEX AND SALES Studios may shop for more female-friendly fare MORE NYC Sex premiere is otherworldly QUIZ Which Sex character is your perfect match? Even more than on the TV series the movie is more about style than substance. The film feels exceedingly familiar -- so much so that most of the plot turns can be guessed well before they happen. The movies nearly 21/2 hours are padded with wardrobe change montages that could test the nerves of even the most die-hard fashionista. Most disappointing is the paucity of clever quips though the film is written and directed by series veteran Michael Patrick King. Still there is something undeniably satisfying about the effort which ties up all the loose ends more decisively than the series finale. The bonds of friendship are celebrated above all -- as is the fact that these women are well into middle age have been through the romance wars and are stronger for it. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) Samantha (Kim Cattrall) Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) remain fashionably turned out stylishly coiffed and each faces a major dilemma. When the film opens Carrie is no longer a columnist but a contributor to Vogue. She and Mr. Big (Chris Noth) have been happily together for the past four years and are contemplating moving into a gorgeous new apartment. Samantha is managing the career of her hunky younger beau Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) and living in Los Angeles. Charlotte has found happiness with husband Harry (Evan Handler) and Miranda is living in Brooklyn and juggling being a mom and a lawyer while married to Steve (David Eigenberg). Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) has a sizable but lackluster part as Carries new assistant and Candice Bergens talents are wasted in a cameo as a Vogue editor. But the movie like the series is all about the emotional ups and downs of the central quartet of sartorially resplendent women. Sex will polarize the sexes. Women will be entranced by the soap opera while men will wonder what all the fuss is about. Amid the style sass and sexiness is plenty of sentimentality especially at the satisfying conclusion. As indulgences go this one is easier on the waistline than downing a tub of Ben amp; Jerrys and wont deplete the wallet like a Louis Vuitton handbag. (Running time 2 hours 22 minutes.

"Same-sex marriage backers target Mormons as debate moves east - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Same-sex marriage backers target Mormons as debate moves eastMay 31 2009|By Karl Vick The Washington PostLOS ANGELES a As more states take up the debate on same-sex marriage some advocates of legalization are taking a very specific lesson from California where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dominated fundraising and door-knocking to pass a ballot initiative that barred such unions.With the battle moving east some advocates are shouting that fact in the streets calculating that on an issue that eventually comes down to comfort levels more people harbor apprehensions about Mormons than about homosexuality.""The Mormons are coming The Mormons are coming"" warned ads placed on newspaper Web sites in three Eastern states last month. The ad was rejected by sites in three other states including Maine where the Kennebec Journal informed Californians Against Hate that the copy ""borders on insulting and denigrating a whole set of people based on their religion.""""Im not intending it to harm the religion. I think they do wonderful things. Nicest people"" said Fred Karger a former Republican campaign consultant who established Californians Against Hate. ""My single goal is to get them out of the same-sex marriage business and back to helping hurricane victims.""The strategy carries risks for a movement grounded in the concept of tolerance. But the demographics tempt proponents of same-sex marriage Mormons account for 2 percent of the U.S. population and they are relatively scarce outside the West. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans know or work with a gay person according to a recent Newsweek survey. Only 48 percent meanwhile know a Mormon according to a Pew Research Center poll.Many Mormons also acknowledge a problematic public profile that could make it difficult for them to lead the fight against same-sex marriage. A 2008 poll by Gary Lawrence author of ""How Americans View Mormonism"" found that for every American who expresses a strong liking for Mormons four express a strong dislike. Among the traits widely ascribed to Mormons in the poll were ""narrow-minded"" and ""controlling.""""Were upside down on our image"" said Lawrence who organized Mormon volunteers in California where on a typical Saturday 25000 turned out to knock on doors. ""People have misperceptions of us because of ignorance because of the history of polygamy and because we organize quickly which scares some people.""Mormon officials have tried to stay out of the controversy after the California vote when the churchs key role in the marriage fight became clear. A spokeswoman in Salt Lake City declined to say whether the church is involved in debates going on in states such as New Jersey and New York except to say that leaders remain intent on preserving the ""divine institution"" of marriage between man and woman.---------When waiting is no gameAir Force officer hopes ban overturned before ouster chicagotribune.com/gaywait MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesUtah puts same-sex marriages on hold pending appealJanuary 8 2014Mormons grow in world countApril 9 2004New booklet seeks to reconcile Mormon faith with gay youthJune 14 2012Can a Mormon be president?December 17 2006Find More Stories AboutChurch Of Jesus ChristTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-sex-and-the-city-0530may31,0,5707602.story",200,sexandthecity31,sexandthecity,chicagotribune

The show was that rare thing a fairy tale you could believe in. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) the lovelorn single-girl newspaper columnist and her devoted trio of BFFs -- randy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) wide-eyed Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and neurotic taskmaster Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) -- all took the fruits of feminism for granted independence equality the right to sleep around etc. Yet what they found was a new kind of liberation. High on their pink drinks and showpiece handbags literally high on their designer heels (and on the prospect of turning the search for a mate into another form of shopping) they embraced the holy right to be cosmetic acquisitive and -- yes -- superficial. If Carries desire for love had an element that was undeniably...aspirational what of it? Wasnt that true of Jane Austens heroines? The glory of Sex and the City is that it turned the cosmopolitan high life of girls who just want to have fun into a new feminine mystique. The movie version of Sex and the City written and directed by Michael Patrick King (always the shows savviest writer) is 2 hours and 22 minutes of love tears fashion depression lavish vacation good sex bad sex and supreme tenderness. Its as long as five series episodes a big sweet tasty layer cake stuffed with zingers and soul and dirty-down verve (its not above having one of the girls poop her pants). Given the running time though not that much happens and what does has several shades more gravitas. Thats as it should be. We want Sex and the City on the big screen to be true to the show yet to feel more like a movie. And it does. Now that Carrie and her crew have left the bittersweet college of cosmo hedonism the film treats them shrewdly as cynical wised-up fortysomethings facing life on the other side of the adult divide. The movie is about the situations Carrie cant just write off with a quip. At the end of the series Carrie had given her heart up to Big (Chris Noth) her Cary-Grant-in-the-age-of-Gordon-Gekko dreamboat financier. So its a bit of a shock to see the two of them at the start of the movie happily unmarried living in separate apartments. I mean what was that grand finale of ""commitment"" about anyway? Have no fear Carrie and Big decide to tie the knot soon enough. Theyre inspired after they find a Fifth Avenue apartment described with acute understatement as ""real estate heaven"" (and thats before Big builds Carrie a walk-in closet the size of a small fashion runway). Of course Carrie is all set to have a princess wedding. She is featured in a whipped-frosting Vivienne Westwood dress in Vogue (Candice Bergen as her editor ""Forty is the last age a woman can be photographed in a wedding dress without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext"") and the ceremony is scheduled to unfold in funky old-world style at the New York Public Library. Then something very Big happens -- not a cookie-cutter mishap but a fluky nervous all-too-believable screwup that metastasizes into disaster. Did I mention that Miranda and Steve (David Eigenberg) in Brooklyn with their kid havent had sex in six months? That Samantha living in L.A. with hunkalicious Smith (Jason Lewis) is going crazy having sex only with him? Or that Charlotte toting her adopted daughter around like an accessory has been rewarded for her good nature by having no problems at all? A therapeutic trip to Mexico goes on for too long yet it sets the tone more melancholy than before and more romantic. Sarah Jessica Parker is lovely here and she has the confidence to know that well follow her even when shes not throwing off sparks of joy. She makes Carries journey lustrous and vivid and Cynthia Nixon does the same for Miranda daring to push her perfectionist impatience to acrid new extremes. We keep waiting for these two to forgive their men; that its so hard for them to do so speaks deeply. If Sex and the City as a movie is good rather than great thats because it lacks the shows antic humming New York effervescence. King would have done well to come up with at least one major subplot that didnt have to do with relationships. And though Jennifer Hudson as Carries assistant has a delicate presence the character is almost embarrassingly saintly. Why couldnt she too pine and chatter with the verve of the city? These are relative quibbles however in a movie that taps directly back into the shows primal appeal which is the sweet sad saucy delight of sharing these womens company.

"SignOnSanDiego.com gt; News gt; Features -- Movie Review Sex and the City satisfies fans More Features news Movie Review Sex and the City satisfies fans By Christy Lemire ASSOCIATED PRESS 806 a.m. May 28 2008 The clothes The shoes The magical depiction of Manhattan and the promise of finally finding true romance Its like porn for women. And we havent even gotten to the sex part of the ""Sex and the City"" movie yet. Fans will be thrilled to see their old friends - Carrie Miranda Charlotte and Samantha - back together and on the big screen which makes it easier to ogle what theyre wearing of course. Everyone else? Well they never watched the HBO series and if they did they didnt get it. Or theyre heterosexual men. But writer/director Michael Patrick King and producer/star Sarah Jessica Parker certainly know their audience the devotees whove already reserved group tickets for opening weekend which theyll celebrate in high style complete with the requisite Cosmopolitan consumption and needless shopping sprees. In that regard this hotly awaited follow-up to the hit TV show which ended in 2004 is a success. This is one of those movies you have assess in terms of whom its aiming to please not unlike the 3-D Hannah Montana concert film The audience has very specific tastes and needs. Surprisingly despite its obsession with all things Manolo Blahnik ""Sex and the City"" also has its share of tearjerker moments. Parker has become such a fashion icon over the past decade that you forget she really can act and is capable of visceral heart-tugging vulnerability. And not to say too much but she does get plenty of opportunities to display that side of her talent - especially with a running time thats well past two hours. Its all really soapy though with only some smidgens of substance. Co-star Cynthia Nixons story line is meaty but more often than not our heroines are defined solely by the partners in their beds and the clothes on their backs as if to suggest that the right wardrobe and a big enough closet to put it all in are the keys to ultimate happiness. The movie (and the series that inspired it) perpetuate stereotypes of female superficiality but then again these women do stick by each other no matter what which makes it somewhat easier to stick around for the conclusion. This critic by the way never saw the artistic need for a ""Sex and the City"" movie. Why not just let the series finale be the end and look back on the whole experience as a wonderful memory shining in the distance like the top of the Chrysler Building on a perfect spring day? (Sorry - its tough not to get all Carrie Bradshaw when talking about this flick.) It is indeed a giddy fizzy kick at the top with Parkers Carrie breathlessly catching us up on whats been going on with the four girlfriends over the past four years. Carrie of course ended up with Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Now that shes grown up and moved on from writing columns to books the two are scouring New York for the perfect apartment (i.e. one with sufficient closet space) - even though theyre not officially engaged. Nixons Miranda is still stuck in Brooklyn (its hard to extricate yourself once youve moved there) with her mensch of a husband Steve (David Eigenberg) and their son. Like so many women shes struggling to juggle marriage motherhood and her career. Former shiksa goddess Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is living in the idyllic bliss of the Upper East Side with hubby Harry (Evan Handler) and the little girl they adopted from China. (King had promised to give each character a full story arc but we see too little of the adorable ever-optimistic Charlotte. Her subplot involving an embarrassing case of Montezumas Revenge during an all-girl trip to Mexico doesnt count.) And even Samantha (Kim Cattrall) has settled down - across the country in a Malibu beach house with her boy-toy lover/client actor Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Naturally this cougar still finds time to salivate over the hot surfer next door who likes to slip out of his wet suit and into his outdoor shower when he isnt bedding random women in full view of the neighbors. And Cattrall the oldest of the foursome at 51 looks the best of all especially in a nude scene that requires her to find creative uses for sushi. They all come together when Carrie announces that she and Big finally plan to tie the knot ... and divulging much more would be positively criminal. Suffice it to say that the trying-on-wedding-gowns montage is a dazzler. (Also back for the movie is the shows legendary costume designer Patricia Field with all the obligatory luxe labels in tow.) Yes marriage matters now to these women who were primarily on the prowl for satisfying romps when ""Sex and the City"" entered the cultural consciousness a decade ago. But the characters were younger then - and so were the actresses playing them. Perhaps its only inevitable that their priorities would shift but the sexual liberation the TV show introduced certainly still lingers. (As for the ethnic diversity that was promised in the film version following complaints that the series was too white it basically consists of Jennifer Hudson appearing in a few scenes as Carries personal assistant - sort of a high-tech housekeeper one with an eye for designer handbags. It feels like too little too late.) Sitting through this extravaganza of extravagance though I couldnt help but wonder ... is this movie ever going to end? It takes about as much time as watching five episodes of the series all in a row which you can do for free on TBS albeit in a form thats cleaned up for basic cable - the city sans the sex. Then again one girls slog is another girls celebration. ""Sex and the City"" a New Line Cinema release is rated R for strong sexual content graphic nudity and language. Running time 142 minutes.

But will they shell out 12 bucks for what amounts to a 21/2-hour ""very special"" TV episode of ""Sex and the City"" that feels like it was written and directed by an audience focus group in Omaha? If the ecstatic reaction at the screening I attended is any indication they might - at least if theyre not heterosexual males bored by the movies endless fashion montages shameless product placements lethally slow pacing and utterly predictable plot. MORE Hot Premiere In Sex-Crazed City MORE Dazzling Fashions Let Stars Glitter PHOTO GALLERY Sex And The City Premiere Or if theyre not feminists distressed by the movies regressive unmistakable subtext that unless shes a sexual compulsive a woman is nothing without a man of her own. I was a big fan of the TV series derived from Candace Bushnells book which defined turn-of-the-21st-century New York and its proudly independent single women in a way that no movie did - at least until it jumped the shark around the fifth season. The series also broke many sexual taboos but in the transfer to the more liberated big screen the quips - like a critique of public grooming and the observation that wedding photos of mature brides carry an ""unintended Diane Arbus subtext"" - often seem more crass than funny. Now 40 Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is working on her fourth book. ""The ultimate single gal"" (as she is described in a Page Six item) is finally getting ready to tie the knot with the elusive Mr. Big - now revealed as John James Preston (Chris Noth) - after moving with him into a Fifth Avenue penthouse roughly the size of Rhode Island. Cynical lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is still married to good-natured Steve (David Eigenberg) and living in Brooklyn with their child. Ditzy Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is raising an adopted Asian child while still secretly hoping to have one with her adoring hubby Harry (Evan Handler). And randy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is amazingly still with hot actor Smith (Jason Lewis) for whom she has forsaken both New York and her career in p.r. to manage Smiths career from a Malibu beachfront house that rivals Carries pad as real-estate porn. Michael Patrick King a series veteran who directs his lackluster script in a perfunctory manner has added one character. Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson (""Dreamgirls"") plays Carries lovestruck personal assistant whose main function appears to be to extend the movies demographic reach to black women. Carrie Miranda and Samantha have their relationships severely tested. I wont disclose exactly how except for the totally unsurprising revelation that Samantha - who acts more like a gay man than ever and as usual gets most of the best lines - is tempted from monogamy by a hunky neighbor. The plot which includes a detour to Mexico often stops for fashion parades - Carrie alone has dozens of costume changes including montages of wedding dresses and all the 80s get-ups in her closet. An episode at Fashion Week accomplishes nothing except to bloat the punishing running time. As was often true of the series Nixon gives the best performance and shes rewarded here with the most developed story arc. The still-sizzling Cattrall has lost none of her skill with one-liners - especially in the movies funniest scene where the girls use the euphemism ""coloring"" to discuss sex in front of a child.Davis still amusing has almost nothing to do. Parkers Carrie spends half the film in a depression which is a drag to watch. And though Parker is one of the producers she often allows herself to be photographed in a highly unflattering manner - including a close-up where her mole looks like Mount Rushmore. The men serve strictly as plot devices. Even resident gays Anthony (Mario Cantone) and Stanford (Willie Garson) seem curiously toned down. ""Why did we ever stop drinking these?"" somebody wistfully asks as the foursome hoists Cosmos. ""Because everybody else did"" is the reply. This movie provides no good reasons to revisit ""Sex and the City"" except to fulfill fans desires for one more for the road and add millions to Time Warners coffers.

Indy on the other hand... _ By David Edelstein Published May 26 2008 ShareThis Illustration by Sean McCabe  (Photo Craig Blankenhorn/Courtesy of New Line Cinema (Sex and the City The Movie); David James/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures (Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull)) Has there ever been a TV series more polarizing than Sex and the City? It polarized me First it drove me crazy (like itching powder) now Im madly in love with it. Its hard to feel halfway about these women and their unabashed materialism overprivilege and self-indulgence their overdependence on and objectification of men. But what a hoot it is to see babes for once doing the objectifyingand talking dirty and sleeping around and measuring their fantasies against the sobering truth of male emotional insufficiency. If the core friendship of Carrie Miranda Samantha and Charlotte is the biggest fantasy of allthey complement one another perfectly; theyre never too competitiveits a moving design for living existential haute couture. The movie which reunites the whole cast even if the other actresses arent palsy-walsy with Kim Cattrall has the delish/insufferable mixture about right. (It wouldnt be SATC if it werent a little annoying.) Sex and the City The Motion Picture (not the actual title) is a joyful wallow. And its more In this summer of do-overs (The Incredible Hulk a new Batman versus a new Joker) its what the series finale should have been. For one last time the relationship columnistcum (no pun intended)anthropologist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) tests the fairy-tale trappings of modern romanceturns them inside out pulls at the loose threads and wrings the tears that have saturated them into iridescent cocktails. (God thats terrible. I have to work on my Bradshaw-esque relationship musings.) Its not that the writer-director Michael Patrick King breaks new ground; its that these women are in their fifth decade and age is a more insistent subtext. The time for do-overs is almost up. The movie opens three-plus years after the series finale and in case you missed that (or the whole show) Carrie helpfully brings you up to date over the opening credits. Morose Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) lives in (shudder) Brooklyn with her mousy husband (David Eigenberg). Chipper Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and hubby Harry (Evan Handler) have adopted a Chinese toddler whose presence makes it somewhat more difficult to babble openly about cunnilingus. Wilting from monogamy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is living on the beach in California with her actor-client-and-hunka-burnin-love Smith (Jason Lewis)which reduces Cattralls face-to-face encounters with her co-stars by about a third. Carrie of course has finally settled into the arms of the rich and powerful Mr. Big (Chris Noth) in happily-ever-after-land and can now afford even more designer clothes and shoes. But its not quite enough. Theyre not formally hitched. What if he dumps her and she has to auction off her jewelry? (This comes to her at the auction of a spurned wifes jewelry.) Maybe she says to Big they should tie the knot. I wouldnt mind being married to you he replies bloodlessly. By the way Is Chris Noth aging into Eddie Munster? I shall not spoil what follows but the wedding sequence (about midway through) is a heart-stoppera mirthless farce in which cell phones and limos function as agents of the unconscious. Its a chance to watch Parker pull out the acting stops and shes spectacularly good The neediness that makes her one of our giddiest comediennes is also a kind of black hole. Parker has come in for some monstrous derision of lateand I suppose its understandable given that shes pushed on billboards as the personification of kitty-cat sultriness. But you can sense the fragility beneath the poses. Shes always the little girl dressing up wriggling from one outfit to the next elated for a bit but apt to wither in the face of rejection or self-doubt. There are plenty of reasons to resent Carries incessant hunger for designer anything but how can you resent Parkers fleeting enchantment? Its what anchors the show. Those outfits by the way are lulusdesigners must have fallen all over themselves to get their stuff into this movie. A woman sitting next to me only took notes on the clothes; behind me came regular gasps of pleasure and (occasionally) horror. In one of the most sublime scenes Carrie cleans out her closet (in preparation for a move) and models her dated getups for Miranda Charlotte and Samantha. The friends have placards TAKE and TRASH. It brought a tear to my eye when Carrie emerged in the little tutu from the shows credit sequence. Oh take take take Sex and the City will make queeny fashion enthusiasts even of those of us whose chief association with the word runway is airplane. Camp of course is central to the appeal especially when Cattrall is onscreenher insouciant vulgarity is indispensable. (I dont care what shes like off-camera.) But the high-spirited bitchery doesnt drown out the softer more realistic notes. Nixons prickly ambivalence over her marriage (and the sacrifices it demands) makes for a bleak subplot. Shes going a little crazyshes the movies sole representative of repressionand her bitterness has consequences for Carrie. The balance between dark and light often tips to the darkwhich makes Kristin Daviss old-fashioned ditzy double-takes all the more essential. (Shes such a cutie.) I havent carped about the smooth-FM music or the fact that the hetero men (Mr. Big semi-excepted) are nonentities. But Sex and the Citys nod to the nonwhite is scary. Jennifer Hudson plays Carries personal assistant and Oh my God its Hattie McDaniel for the new millennium Instead of cleaning Carries house she cleans up her computer files (although she does help declutter the apartment too). She admires her mistress in those beautiful outfits. And check out that smile when you give her a Louis Vuitton handbag Please Sex and the City do not pretend you exist in the real multiracial world. White will always be your new black. 1 2 Next Share this story...

For a series so steeped in romance the eagerly awaited ""Sex and the City"" movie feels a trifle half-hearted. Although theres pleasure in seeing HBOs fabulous four reunited writer-director Michael Patrick King doesnt fully bridge the gap between TV and film -- delivering major story flourishes but too often playing like a regular episode bloated to five times its customary length. Best in its small moments the movie should find receptive gal pals congregating for the mother of all viewing parties but appeal beyond that core should present New Line with less of a storybook finish than it doubtless would like. The shows creative guiding light in its later seasons King dispenses with a quick guide to ""Sex"" via a clever opening-credit sequence. In short order he catches the audience up on the characters who were allowed to hopefully ride into the sunset in the series finale. If only the movie exhibited the same dedication to pacing beyond that point. Without giving away too much regarding the story one theme explores the boundaries of forgiveness -- a touch ironic for a romantic comedy that commits the near-irredeemable sin of stretching to nearly 2 1/2 hours. A little time has passed and its in keeping with the shows melancholy tone that fairy-tale endings dont necessarily mean happily ever after. So the groups narrator Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still involved with the on-off-and-finally-on-again mogul Mr. Big (Chris Noth); the prickly Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is adjusting to marriage and over-scheduled motherhood; Charlotte (Kristin Davis) remains a wide-eyed dreamer; and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) chafes at monogamy despite her Hollywood bedmate being the younger classically gorgeous TV star Smith (Jason Lewis). Each of the women inevitably faces their own obstacles providing them with individual highlights around Parkers Carrie whose situation drives the story. Those arcs however ultimately prove less satisfying than the simplest scenes such as the four getting loopy on champagne together or Davis Charlotte emotionally standing up for one of her friends. As for new blood Jennifer Hudson drops in as Carries new assistant graced with a 20-somethings faith in love. The ""Dreamgirls"" star makes more of the sketchy part than she has any right to (and naturally belts out one of the songs) while not incidentally representing a demographic break from the shows largely monochromatic palette. Not surprisingly virtually every pricey label imaginable finds its way into ""Sexs"" fashion-obsessed accessorizing. Thanks to Samantha moreover women also get to enjoy that rarest of cinematic moments -- sequences that completely objectify men for a change. (In this case the heretofore unknown stock to buy would be Gilles Marini cast in the near-non-verbal role of dreamboat neighbor Dante a name chosen with sly purpose.) Adapting any TV series to film is a daunting task -- including apparently even one previously blessed with HBOs artistic latitude. The delicate transfer process requires capturing the programs essence while justifying the change of venue. ""Just like old times"" Samantha sighs during one joint outing and it must have felt that way particularly with King reassembling much of the shows creative team as well as its cast. Kind of like old times actually but not quite -- evidence that even a glossed-up version of Manhattan is a hard place to go home again.
