But as a director Clint Eastwood is keeping his nose to the grindstone. He spent the end of 2009 filming a Peter Morgan-penned thriller Hereafter in Europe and the US and earlier last year decamped to South Africa to film this respectful rousing drama about Nelson Mandelas canny co-opting of the 1995 Rubgy World Cup Finals as a tool to promote racial harmony across the social and political tinderbox that was the new post-apartheid state. Eastwood isnt a director to indulge in shades of grey and so the films first scenes of the historic televised release of Mandela (Morgan Freeman) from prison in 1990 are preceded by a shot of white boys playing rugby on one side of the road while their black equivalents kick a football on the other. Simple imagery a background of division established - job done.A similar no-nonsense efficiency colours the whole film which jumps forward to Mandelas inauguration in 1994 again mixing reconstruction and news footage before ditching this early documentary feel to settle into a behind-the-scenes walk-through of the early months of his presidency. This was a time when existing presidential staff wrongly expected to be booted out of their jobs; a black civil-rights group believed also wrongly that Mandela would support their desire to change the name and colours of the national rugby team; and somewhere in a white suburb the captain of that same team Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and his family were shaking their heads at the assumption that their country was heading to the dogs.Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham further stress South Africas lingering disharmony through a chorus of Mandelas bodyguards for which existing white heavies are  joined by new black counterparts. Between them they trade insults and glares like boxers before a fight. Again its a simple tool useful enough but marred by some substandard local actors. All praise to Eastwood for casting on the ground; less praise to him for allowing them to disrupt his movie with their awkward presence.From here its valuable life lessons all round as Mandela invites Pienaar to tea joins the rugby team in training and - famously - strides on to the pitch at the South Africa v New Zealand final wearing the same Springboks shirt that a year earlier was a divisive symbol of the old nation. Security tensions at this match offer Eastwood an unnecessary sideshow as he tries and fails to insert a thriller element into the film by hinting at a bomb attack or assassination attempt - real fears at the time but out of place here. A shot of an aircraft flying above the stadium plays on post-9/11 fears - but would anyone in 1995 have suspected a low-flying passenger plane of terrorism?Both leads are effective and Damon is very good at displaying Pienaars conservatism cracking in the glare of Mandelas wise optimism. Freeman is perhaps too stately but its a thankless task trying to pull off an impersonation of such a public figure. Hes more at ease in intimate scenes although on a technical level his accent raises the odd eyebrow.Invictus isnt one of Eastwoods best films especially judged against the late flowering of his career since 2003s Mystic River. But its still a noble and compassionate work that in its later scenes manages successfully to invest our emotions in the triumph of an important - if overlong - sporting victory.

With both Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon heading the cast the historical material the setting and that Mandella was the primary focus of the film IaEUR(tm)m surprised CE couldnaEUR(tm)t have done much better. I expected much better. When you think of the quality of African photography in films like ""The Constant Gardener"" you realise just how heavy handed Clint Eastwood can be as a director. Like ""Grand Torino"" I found this film a little clichA(c)d - almost as though Clint doesnaEUR(tm)t trust his audience to be smart enough to pick up on more subtle clues. The white and black boys playing in separate fields at the start of the film was all too obvious. The script was equally leaden and the characterisation poor - I couldnaEUR(tm)t have cared less about any of the characters portrayed in the film. Some of the actors were poorly chosen.

The film got applause at the end a formulaic sports film so no surprises.

In fact this is about a famous man with a difficult objective can the newly elected president of South Africa - torn apart by apartheid - unite the country through a single belief that their inadequate national Rugby Union squad can rise to the challenge of winning the World Cup as the host nation? The two guarantees that this can be achieved are firstly historical accuracy and secondly the presence of Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela. Both individuals have the advantage of being universally popular but thereaEUR(tm)s a contradiction in that the very distinctive vocal characteristics and looks of Freeman and Mandela respectively sometimes leads to a strange metamorphosis. Eastwood has two strong commercial draws in casting Freeman who does all the talking and Matt Damon who as the South African team captain Francois Pienaar does all the running around. ItaEUR(tm)s odd to see Damon just doing a cameo role. The well established themes of race and change of powerbase are reflected in many scenes connecting Mandela his security team and family but with little intensity or dramatic structure. The idea that Mandela is exploiting sportsmen for political ends is not really debated or contended. In the end the mending and melding of interracial feeling is demonstrated with the Rugby teamaEUR(tm)s ultimate victory but we all know this is an aberration so why sentimentalise the event as having a happy ending. We understand that MandelaaEUR(tm)s strength in prison had come from reading William Earnest HenleyaEUR(tm)s poem aEURoeInvictusaEUR but little was made of its significance except as the inspirational currency offered by the president to his Rugby captain. Mandela is heard quoting the last lines from the poem aEURoeI am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soulaEUR but Francois PienaaraEUR(tm)s thoughts in contrast were somewhat muted except on the playing field. The dialogue is usually satisfying although Mandela seems to speak in aphorisms for the most part. This is essentially a feel-good sort of docudrama celebrating Mandela and achieving its objectives without too much dramatic invention. If you like sport-based films itaEUR(tm)s an enjoyable watch which pays reasonable attention to the sporting detail.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2010ColinFeaturedThe successes of this film are clear important and make it well worth seeing. These are the reverent impersonation of Nelson Mandela by Morgan Freeman Matt Damons excellence and the truthful depection of how a man Mandela saved a nation from post-apartheid implosion. Freeman gives the performance of a lifetime his Mandela feels like the real thing yet it is clear it is Morgan. Matt Damon gives a highly believable performance of the decent but woefully ignorant white South African. The South Africa of 1995 is riven by the poverty of the ordinary black citizen the stupidity of the defeated racists and the understandable yet disasterous thirst for revenge by ANC activists. Mandela uses the Rugby World Cup to bring a nation together as one for the very first time. An act of leadership of a genius magnitude. It is the rugby that is the weaknesses of the film. Basically there is too much of it. There needs to be some Eastwood is right to use it as a vehicle for nation building but frankly it is boring and the point is made with repetitive point made frequency. So much was achieved during this period in South African history that could have been explored on the theme of nation building for example the extraordinary Truth and Reconciliation Committee. Perhaps this is for one of the many other Mandela films that are sure to be produced in years to come but the obsession with rugby in Invictus detracts from what would otherwise be a great film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 20 2009Thomas NoctorFeaturedThis is the first Oscar Nominated film Ive seen since The Dark Knight thats actually an excellent After boring films like Juno No Country For Old Men and so on here comes a movie that deserves it.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 11 2009 1132 AM In Rugby We Trust Clint Eastwoods Invictus could have used a few less scrums. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Invictus come back and join the scrum with our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon in Invictus If Invictus (Warner Bros.) Clint Eastwoods inspirational sports biopic about the victory of the South African rugby team during Nelson Mandelas first year in office had been made by any other director it would be regarded as a tedious unfocused underplotted movie with a single strong selling point The casting of Morgan Freeman as Mandela. Not the performance the casting. No one else alive is as well suited to play the great South African leader. Freeman uncannily resembles Mandela he imitates his accent convincingly he radiates a benevolent aura of righteousness--but when does Morgan Freeman not radiate a benevolent aura of righteousness? What ought to have been the role of Freemans career is instead less of an acting challenge than Driving Miss Daisy. Freeman-as-Mandela is an actor all dressed up with no place to go--at least nowhere we didnt already know he was headed. True-life sports movies always work against the same disadvantage Win or lose the outcome of the game is known in advance. The only way to make the audience care is to somehow get us inside the heads of the people who were experiencing the triumph in real time. Eastwood goes to great lengths to explain why the 1995 World Cup championship was so important to South Africa Only a few years out of the apartheid era the nation needed a common cause for blacks and whites to rally around and the national team the Springboks had historically meant nothing to black South Africans except being a symbol of segregation and oppression. Maddeningly the movie never manages to make the championship matter to us. Advertisement Invictus which takes its title from a Victorian poem that Mandela clung to as a source of hope during his 27 years in prison takes one of the most genuinely inspiring moments in modern history and turns it into a high-minded plod. Every character is defined solely in terms of his (or her--but there arent many significant hers on the premises) degree of racial nobility. Every line out of Mandelas mouth is a platitude ""Forgiveness is a powerful weapon"" or ""In order to build South Africa we must all exceed our own expectations."" As Mandela discusses leadership techniques over tea with the captain of the Springboks Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) both men agree on the importance of leading by example. But all either one does is lecture. ""The rainbow nation starts here"" Mandela scolds his bodyguards who are prickly at first about integrating their ranks. Handing out beers to his dispirited team after a loss Pienaar encourages them to drink up with these heartening words ""Taste it? Thats the taste of defeat."" Must the task of healing a divided nation fall exclusively into the hands of humorless goody-two-shoes? It would seem hard to botch the inherently suspenseful events of the 1995 World Cup championship game in which the underdog Boks fought their way back from a tie to win in an overtime squeaker. But though this film contains plenty of rugby--for viewers congenitally indifferent to sports a lifetimes worth of rugby--Eastwood never gives his audience a basic grounding in how the sport works. For those not already in-the-know the rules of the game remain as perplexing as those of Fantastic Mr. Foxs whack-bat. What exactly is accomplished in the scrum? Whats a drop goal and what does it mean to win a game on one? And what are the strengths and weaknesses of this particular team other than the obvious fact that they go from playing badly to playing well after a training montage? A great sports movie--North Dallas Forty Rocky Breaking Away--gives its characters athletic personalities Whos cool under pressure? Whos a choker? Whos phoning it in? Aside from Damons Pienaar who is himself little more than a resolute slab of muscle the Springboks barely get personalities period. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As a non-South African I cant speak to the accuracy of the movies racial politics but they feel insultingly vague. A feel-good montage scored to a pop song that brags ""Im colorblind"" smacks of self-congratulation and the frequent paeans to equality and justice have an abstract civics-class quality. The movies only real suspense comes early on in a subplot about racial antagonism in the ranks of Mandelas security staff but the Springboks victory seems to wash all these tensions away in a rush of bonhomie. Invictus based on a nonfiction account by John Carlin posits Mandelas embrace of the national rugby team as a visionary moment of governance but the movie never pauses to consider the question that must have dogged the president at the time What if the Boks hadnt won the game?

Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon Invictus uses the game of rugby as a metaphor for political struggle to show how the brutality of apartheid was channelled onto the playing field.(Keith Bernstein/(c)2009 Warner Bros. Entertainment Iand Spyglass Entertainment Funding LLC.) Globe review Eastwood makes our day with a tale worth telling Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 10 2009 1251PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Invictus Directed by Clint Eastwood Written by Anthony Peckham Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon Classification PG Earlier this year director Quentin Tarantino at 48 vowed to retire before he was 60 arguing that directors get worse as they get older. Alternatively he could follow the example of Clint Eastwood and improve with age. The whispery macho actor born in 1930 has done most of his best work since 1990. In particular Eastwoods creative burst of the last half-dozen years ( Mystic River Million Dollar Baby Letters from Iwo Jima ) has earned critical respect and awards for his grown-up tough-minded dramas about people struggling to prove their worth to themselves and society. His new movie Invictus (adapted by Anthony Peckham from John Carlins book Playing the Enemy Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation ) is too conventional to be rated among his best films but its a well-made film with a tale worth telling. The story of how Nelson Mandela chose the white-supported national rugby team the Springboks to become a symbol of national reconciliation is uncharacteristically optimistic for Eastwood. The movie begins in 1990 as Mandela newly released from jail after 27 years drives by in a motorcade down a road between two playing fields. On one side of the road a group of uniformed white men are playing rugby; on the other a group of ragtag African children are playing soccer. As the car passes the African kids press to the fence and cheer. The white rugby players watch morosely. Four years later Mandela (Morgan Freeman) takes over as president and the white civil servants start packing up their boxes. Mandela asks them to stay and startles his security guards when he orders them to accept several Afrikaners the same brutes who defended the apartheid regime in their ranks. Facing a country where the army and police force and much of the administration is still run by whites hes anxious to find any symbols to assuage white fears and black anger. The focus of Invictus is less on Mandelas psychology than his willpower and political astuteness. The title Invictus (Latin for ""unconquered"") comes from a Victorian poem written by William Ernest Henley (""My head is bloodied and unbowed"") which served as inspirational reading for the South African leader while he was in prison. A few scenes show Mandelas solitude estrangement from his family his fragile health and harrowing schedule. Though theres an aura of saintliness around the leader Freeman brings his own wry humour to the part playing Mandela as a combination of Zen master and cagey politician. When the South African sports authority votes to rename the team and ban the gold and green colours associated with the previous regime Mandela sees an opportunity to confound expectations. Against his advisors wishes he overrules the decision and invites the gentleman captain of the team Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon looking blond and muscular) to tea. Pienaar an uncomplicated but proud athlete from a well-off family is awed and inspired by the encounter. The two men compare notes on leadership and Mandela leaves Pienaar with a mission He has the governments full support to win the World Cup for South Africa. To do so the Springboks who have just one black player have to commit to becoming the peoples team travelling around the country holding coaching clinics among black youth. A buildup of popular support and a trio of World Cup victories leads to the World Cup final against the New Zealand All-Blacks. The match occupies the last 20 minutes of the movie. The intense physical struggle of the game is emphasized with overhead shots which make the scrums look like a many-legged beast in a death spasm. Much of the action focuses on the South African team working to shut down New Zealands giant star Jonah Lomu (played by retired New Zealand player Zak Feaunati) known for his speed power and disconcerting habit of running over top of opponents. There are many cutaways from the game to celebrating fans - white homeowners and their black maid white cops and a black street kid bodyguards of both colours - a technique thats effective if not particularly subtle. More impressive is the way that Eastwood uses the game as a metaphor for political struggle to show how the brutality of apartheid was channelled onto the playing field. For once the sports-movie cliche ""more than a game"" has some real resonance.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""Invictus"" Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon portray Nelson Mandela president of South Africa and Francois Pienaar captain of the rugby team the Springboks. In 1995 South Africa was to play host to the rugby World Cup final. Recently elected Mandela saw in the Springboks a chance to unite the country. He was in a minority. The team clad in green and gold represented tradition for the white minority. For the black majority it stood for apartheids brute force and arrogance. Directed by Clint Eastwood ""Invictus"" proves a rousing example of how the best sports dramas distill our ""more than a game"" ambitions. Madiba -- an honorific that many used to address Mandela -- has become South Africas first democratically elected leader after apartheid. There is joy and derision. There is a mood of empowerment and a suspicion that the majority will settle old scores. Yes these polarities break down along racial lines. At his parents modest home Pienaars father grouses about majority rule within earshot of their beloved (but disrespected) black housekeeper. Early on in one of the many lines likely to resonate with American audiences Mandela has proven ""that he can win an election but can run a country?"" Adapted by South African Anthony Peckham from John Carlins book ""Playing the Enemy"" the film isnt obsessed with political extremes. Instead it focuses on Mandelas will to bring blacks and whites to common ground. That he imagines that such turf could be a rugby field (during a globally televised event) is a sign of agile aware leadership. Freeman relishes Mandelas finely tuned managerial reflexes. When he takes office in Pretoria he tells the hirees of former president F.W. de Klerk that they have a place in his administration if they want it. He then pulls the rug from under his own security detail by integrating them too. The first meeting of his men (played with hackles raised by Tony Kgoroge and Patrick Mofokeng) and the Secret Branch is a tense (and amusing) Jets-meets- Sharks face-off. ""Invictus"" means ""unconquerable"" a notion Mandela embraced while incarcerated at Robben Island. Freemans face is weathered his demeanor apt for the loneliness of leadership. By this time Mandela was estranged from second wife Winnie. Damon did the physical training to resemble a thick rugby player. But its his quiet trust in transformation -- Pienaars Mandelas a nations -- that makes this one of his finest turns. His hands outstretched in the prison cell that held the leader of the African National Congress for 27 years Pienaar begins to grasp the depth of Mandelas capacity to forgive. His conversion to an ally is complete. In the introduction to his book journalist Carlin admits he wanted to tell an unapologetically hopeful story about South Africas miracle of a negotiated shift in power. ""Invictus"" is an unabashedly inspiring (even amusing) movie. Eastwood makes moving pictures that seldom collapse under the burden of sentiment. He has a muscular understanding of how kernels of wisdom neednt become caramel corn. Now a few words about the sport at the center of ""Invictus"" With its grunting exertions group shoves and drop kicks for many audiences rugby will seem like a game told in a foreign language. Yet we dont have to understand the rules of the game to grasp the ambitions of the undertaking. Come the championship battle -- waged ironically against the All Blacks of New Zealand -- we take our cue from a packed stadium. We cast our lot with a nation of 43 million rooting for the home team. ""INVICTUS."" PG-13 for brief strong language. 2 hours 13 minutes.

Comments (2) Invictus Free Video Rated PG-13  134 minutes  2009 Based on a book by John Carlin this elephantine sports drama chronicles President Nelson Mandelas quest to unite black and white South Africans by driving the national rugby team to victory in the 1995 World Cup. The movies biggest asset is Morgan Freeman in the lead role; he captures not only Mandelas moral power and political savvy but his childlike exuberance as the demoralized Springboks (nearly all of them Afrikaners) begin to pull themselves together and beat the odds. But Anthony Peckhams script is formulaic woodenly reverent and devoid of real dramatic tension. Clint Eastwood directed completely out of his element and Matt Damon costars as Francois Pienaar captain of the Springboks. By J.R.

Keith Bernstein hide caption toggle caption Keith Bernstein Invictus Director Clint EastwoodGenre DramaRunning Time 132 minutes Rated PG-13 brief strong languageWith Morgan Freeman Matt Damon Watch Clips Let Me Lead You Reconciliation Starts Here This Is Our Destiny The same Hollywood that gave us Johnny Cash as a tormented country-music star Erin Brockovich as a ferocious legal investigator and Coco Chanel as an inspirational fashion designer now gives us Nelson Mandela as ... a sports fan? Whoda thunk? And frankly whod have green-lighted such a project if Invictus didnt have Morgan Freeman playing Mandela and Clint Eastwood urging him on behind the camera? Which is not to say Invictus is in any way graceless -- only that it occasionally seems simultaneously on point and off-center focusing on a literal playing field rather than on the political creation of an even playing field. Still its first reel about Mandelas ascension to the presidency of a freshly post-apartheid South Africa after 27 years in prison will almost certainly choke audiences up as much for reasons of history as of filmmaking. It would be hard not to be moved by aerial shots of long lines snaking toward township polling booths -- 1994 news footage this is -- as black South Africans voted not just for the first time in national elections but also for one of their own. That election altered their nations social fabric and though the film doesnt lean on the parallels it has obvious echoes for audiences in an Obama-led America. Ill confess to welling up a bit in that opening reel as Freemans Mandela gathered white F.W. de Klerk-era government employees whod been clearing out their desks and fearing reprisals after years of white-supremacist policies to tell them that he hoped theyd stay on with his new administration. The reconciliation pep talk he delivers is engaging his cadences warm his logic impeccable. And if the warmth flows back his way a little too easily from a roomful of smiling white faces well cut Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham some slack They have just a couple of hours to bridge a racial divide that goes back generations. Mandela of course had a bit longer than that and he used a lot of different tactics to defuse tensions in a nation that might easily have slid into social and political instability. The ploy Invictus fixes on with John Carlins book Playing the Enemy as its inspiration is a particularly unorthodox (and apparently a particularly effective) one involving South Africas nearly all-white national rugby team the Springboks. The team -- their name their symbol even the green and gold of their uniforms -- was the very embodiment of apartheid and the hated old regime cheered by whites and cheered against by blacks whod traditionally root for whoever was on the other side of the pitch. Mandela attends a game spies a potential teaching moment and invites the Springboks Afrikaner captain to tea suggesting that its in the interest of the country to broaden the teams populist appeal before South Africa hosts the Rugby World Cup in 1995. i Mandela works with Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) captain of the national rugby team to unite a nation in support of its underdog team. Keith Bernstein hide caption toggle caption Keith Bernstein Mandela works with Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) captain of the national rugby team to unite a nation in support of its underdog team. Keith Bernstein Intriguing setup. Next comes the scrum which proves significantly less engaging -- much rugby a bit of hero worship and a settling into sports-movie conventions that seem awfully tidy considering that Invictus (Latin for ""unconquered"") centers on the most unruly sport imaginable. By hewing to both the hagiographic rules of movie biographies and the inspirational rules of sports dramas the film ends up making even the job of nation-changing seem remarkably tame. Freemans Mandela however is pretty marvelous -- so persuasive in gesture in bearing in that signature mix of gravitas and twinkle even in accent -- that when a shot of the real Mandela appears over the final credits its momentarily jarring to realize youve been watching an impersonation. As with most Hollywood films about major black figures a white star -- Matt Damon freshly bulked up as Springboks captain Francois Pienaar -- is also on hand to offer a bit of box-office insurance. He and his teammates appear to be enjoying themselves on the rugby pitch particularly in a sequence that has them at Mandelas insistence doing some outreach in the townships with rugby camps for kids. (If among the faces behind Damon in those scenes you spy one that looks vaguely familiar theres a reason Hes Eastwoods son Scott.) As with all Eastwood-directed films Invictus uses finely wrought domestic details (a framed photo establishing family relationships an age-signifying stiffness of gait a glance that telegraphs acquiescence after a momentary struggle) to create a portrait not just of a central personality but of the community around him. But a heavier hand also gets applied at times -- with a trip to visit Mandelas old jail cell on Robben Island in a score that punches emotional moments a bit too hard -- and the film loses steam in a last half-hour thats largely given over to the climax of a rugby championship game played out in real time. Given the nature of the game the sequence is confusing and the outcome a foregone conclusion. Still as an acting vehicle for Freeman and as a frankly inspirational tale from Eastwood about the late-in-life achievements of a celebrated figure who would have been plenty impressive had he simply rested on his laurels Invictus has obvious virtues. It feels heartfelt -- a generous elders film about a generous elders bequest to the world.

"Movie review Clint Eastwoods rugby drama Invictus with Matt Damon washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Invictus Movie review Clint Eastwoods rugby drama Invictus with Matt Damon Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 11 2009 If 2009 had a most valuable player award for the movies it would have to go to Matt Damon. Whether hes appearing in ""The Informant"" a Sarah Silverman Web parody or in Clint Eastwoods stirring post-apartheid drama ""Invictus"" he has been consistently spot-on and almost breathtakingly self-effacing. He has become that most unlikely Hollywood rarity a character actor with a matinee-idol face. In ""Invictus"" Damon plays Francois Pienaar the captain of the South African rugby team the Springboks which in 1995 won the World Cup. The movie tells the story of that unlikely and politically crucial victory which as much as anything was the result of the gentle coaxing and adamantine moral suasion of the countrys new president Nelson Mandela. Morgan Freeman doesnt play Mandela as much as inhabit the man in a performance that seems to embody the very transcendence that Mandela himself has come to stand for. Freeman captures with perfect pitch the inner workings of a man who put in charge of a country still ravaged by the still-fresh violence and injustices of apartheid sees an opportunity for healing in the rites and rituals of sport. His job is to forge within the black community a sense of identification with a mostly white team that for years has represented oppression. Eastwood adopts a flat uninflected style for ""Invictus"" wisely letting this remarkable story tell itself with a minimum of flourish or underlining. The result is a thoroughly absorbing inspiring movie that like last years ""Milk"" features one of the years most galvanizing performances. Freeman doesnt merely impersonate Mandela as much as personify not just political genius but an almost superhuman suppleness of character. Rugby is exciting sure but theres nothing more thrilling than radical forgiveness in action.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains brief strong profanity. 133 minutes.

Photo Keith Bernstein As he approaches 80 living legend Clint Eastwood shows no signs of slowing down nor shirking from challenges as a filmmaker. The Oscar-caliber ""Invictus"" entertainingly delves into South African politics and rugby two normally forbidding subjects for American audiences. Thanks to expert performances by Morgan Freeman (as Nelson Mandela) and a buffed-up Matt Damon -- as well as Eastwoods old-school storytelling expertise -- this movie depicts an unlikely intersection of sports and leadership in ways that manage to be inspiring and insightful without ever becoming schmaltzy or preachy. The story takes place during a few months in 1995 when South African President Mandela -- like another president you may have heard of -- was struggling to unite a badly divided country. Mandela shocks even his closest advisers when he decides to become the countrys biggest booster of the Springboks the national rugby team beloved by the white Afrikaner minority that had brutally ruled the country through decades of apartheid. At the same time the Springboks -- with one black player -- were seen by the black majority as a symbol of apartheid with Mandelas supporters even trying to disband the team before he steps in. A pragmatist who had closely studied the Afrikaners during his 27 years as a political prisoner Mandela realized that humiliating his former enemies would only further destabilize the country. Mandela finds an improbable ally when he reaches out to the teams apolitical captain Francois Pienaar (an excellent Damon) who only wants to turn around his perennially losing squad -- and orders the team to tour shantytowns where black kids prefer soccer to rugby. Can Mandela actually rally the entire country around the Springboks as they seek the Rugby World Cup? Anthony Peckhams intelligent screenplay -- adapted from John Carlins book ""Playing the Enemy"" -- cleverly represents the polarized South Africa through Mandelas security detail. Because of the security squads public visibility Mandela insists that menacing Afrikaners from the apartheid regime be retained joining his longtime supporters from the African National Congress. The film climaxes with an exciting championship match against New Zealands All-Blacks squad which ironically takes its name from the color of its uniforms rather than its members. While the unusual formations are fun to watch I cant say I actually understand rugby from Eastwoods film which is far more concerned with Mandelas unconventional efforts at racial healing. It would be easy to turn Mandela into a saint but Eastwood and his longtime collaborator Freeman in the role of his career never let this happen. While upbeat and optimistic Mandela is shown as a man with a healthy sense of humor and personal regrets -- separated from his (never seen) wife Winnie and barely on speaking terms with a daughter who does not share his spirit of reconciliation. Handsomely shot on location in South Africa the slightly overlong ""Invictus"" takes its title -- Latin for unconquered -- from a poem that Mandela used as an inspiration during his lengthy imprisonment. Most filmmakers would offer a lengthy flashback or speech from Mandela about this experience. Eastwood though tells you all you need to know about the horrors of apartheid through the look on Pienaars face when he visits Mandelas tiny cell. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jon Gosselin barred from appearances that violate TLC cont...

Media San Francisco Chronicle Invictus Drama. Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 134 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Morgan Freeman has become such a notable and noble presence in American film that it would seem almost as appropriate for Nelson Mandela to be playing Freeman in ""Invictus"" instead of the reverse. Freemans signature presence comes rich with associations but it comes with disadvantages too. For example when this actor who has one of the most recognizable speaking styles in movies first starts talking with a South African accent the effect is inescapably comical. Equally disconcerting is the first sight of Freeman who usually can manage little more than a wistful smile suddenly beaming in that genial Mandela way. Instead of accepting that this is Mandela and hes cheerful the first thought that flits across the mind is ""Wow. Morgan Freeman must be really happy to be playing Mandela."" And he should be happy. This latest from Clint Eastwood is by design a serious holiday-season movie and an automatic Academy Award contender. Its intelligent and classically made and some people could easily mistake it for a great film. It is in a sense a movie in the Great Film Genre - with a worthy subject an important director and a major actor swinging for the fences in the kind of real-life role that automatically wins respect. But it falls short of its clear intention (just a little too clear) to be inspirational.

Entertainmen Review Invictus narrows its viewpoint 1 / 5 Back to Gallery This is what Eastwood gets for making a lot of great movies in recent years. When he finally makes just a good one its necessary to explain why and it sounds like a slam. In fact ""Invictus"" contains many fine Eastwood touches which highlight his skill and his tough-guy Norman Rockwell personality. Heres just one example During a crucial rugby match he shows a little black boy lingering by a police car in which two white cops are listening to the game. Throughout the match Eastwood cuts to the three of them each time showing the boy edging closer ... until finally all three are listening and celebrating together. Eastwood contains the entire essence of his story in those little wordless tableaus and in a light and seemingly offhand way. ""Invictus"" is a sort of combination biopic/sports movie which tells the story of Nelson Mandela from his release after 27 years in prison through his first years as South Africas president. Freeman who grows into the role presents Mandela as a master manipulator one who is genuinely appreciative of other people but nonetheless aware of his own charm. He has the politicians gift of being able to say things without saying them and hes nicely matched in their few scenes together by Matt Damon as a rugby team captain who is modest open and completely straightforward. Some of the best parts of the film occur in the first hour in which Mandela upon assuming the presidency has to rein in his own partisans who want to exact vengeance on the white population after years of apartheid. These early scenes show the dangers Mandela faced and showcase his political acumen as well as his humanity and psychological insight. Mandela doesnt want to fracture his country but unite it and so he seizes on the rugby team - with its millions of white fans - as a vehicle for bringing together all South Africans in a common cause. In his subtle suggestive way he lets it be known that South Africa must win the World Cup. ""This country is hungry for greatness"" he says. At its best ""Invictus"" demonstrates the connections between sports and politics as in the superb scene in which the team goes to a poor black township to teach the kids rugby. But as the film wears on ""Invictus"" takes on the contours of a standard sports movie making it both predictable - wanna guess the ending? - and reductive Certainly South Africa had bigger problems than rugby and Mandela had more on his plate than the World Cup. Eastwood devotes about 20 minutes to the final game. He does it well For one thing he doesnt fall back on the crutch of having an announcer tell us whats going on. But by then ""Invictus"" is mostly about the game and only partly about South Africa and Mandela. Its never less than worthy and entertaining but the importance of ""Invictus"" doesnt broaden as it goes along. It narrows. -- Advisory Aside from some brief strong language - cover their ears - theres nothing here that kids cant see.

His work in the past decade has been of such consistent excellence that a movie that is merely very good suffers in comparison to what came before.Matt Damon left as Springboks captain Francois Pienaar holds his own against the tour-de-force of Morgan Freeman portraying Nelson Mandela.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 11 2009 Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 113 minutes. At major theatres. PG Every director should have Clint Eastwoods dilemma.His work in the past decade has been of such consistent excellence that a movie that is merely very good suffers in comparison to what came before.Article Continued BelowInvictus is a very good movie. Titled for the Latin word for ""invincible"" it stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and you couldnt imagine a more unbeatable confluence than that. Freeman captures the South African icons deliberate manner and cadence and seems imbued with the same inner fire.Matt Damon co-stars as Francois Pienaar the captain of South Africas national rugby team in the 1995 World Cup a momentous series that came to be about far more than sport. Damons performance is also impeccable and he seems to have nailed the South African accent.As always Eastwood brings solid craftsmanship to the proceedings with direction that allows the actors to breathe while remaining alert to small details that speak of greater wisdom.If you sense a ""but"" in the above praise you are correct. For once Eastwoods famous restraint hasnt entirely served him well. Invictus is a movie about emotions made by a man who distrusts naked displays of emotion. The story adapted by Anthony Peckham from John Carlins book Playing the Enemy is a natural for a cinematic treatment. After a brief prologue set in 1990 marking Mandelas release from jail after 27 years of imprisonment by the racist apartheid regime it jumps to the difficult days following his 1994 election as South Africas president.Having been a symbol of determined struggle during his years behind bars Mandela is aware of the power of gestures. He knows the world considers his country a pariah nation with entrenched racism added to seemingly unsolvable problems of poverty unemployment and a weakened currency.Mandela pointedly tells his black supporters that he will also have white people on his staff (""The rainbow nation starts here"") and this includes his personal bodyguards. An early showdown between black guards who call Mandela by his affectionate name ""Mandiba"" and white guards who refer to him as ""Mr. President"" shows how difficult it is to turn words into deeds. Indeed the country is on the verge of civil war between newly empowered blacks confronting frightened and angry whites.Racial tensions come to the fore over the Springboks the national rugby team long associated with apartheid-supporting Afrikaners. Blacks despise everything about the team from its name to its green-and-gold colours. The black majority vote to change the Springboks name logo and colours but Mandela asks for another vote. He argues that its time for forgiveness and reconciliation not for provocation and rehashing of old feuds. At great risk to his personal capital he extends the hand of friendship to Pienaar and the Springboks vowing his support in their efforts to gain a berth in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Its a quest that seems futile given the teams poor win-loss record and the strength of the almost undefeated chief rival team New Zealands All Blacks. Mandela tells his skeptical aides that a triumphant Springboks would unite the country rather than divide it ""It is a human calculation.""Canadians who remember the 1972 Team Canada vs. Soviets hockey series will have no trouble believing that a sports contest could become a defining moment for a nation.Does Eastwood truly buy though? He devotes most of Invictus to showing Mandela preparing for an epic battle that is depicted with almost indecent haste and far less passion than youd expect. Most directors would make far more than Eastwood does of the intense moment where the Springboks meet the All Blacks on the field in a match played before 62000 fans at Johannesburgs Ellis Park Stadium. Theres also a lopsided approach to Mandela and Pienaar. Far less screen time is devoted to Pienaars preparations and motivations which are also complicated because not all of the Springboks believe in racial equality. As a result we never really get to understand the character that Damon serves so well.Eastwood seems reluctant to stray too far from the burnished public image of Mandela as a latter-day saint. Apart from a brief reference to marital and family troubles nothing is shown of Mandelas turbulent home life after his release from prison when for personal and political reasons he divorced Winnie Mandela his wife of several decades.These shortcomings dont defeat Invictus. If another directors name were on the film there might be a temptation to rate it higher. But Eastwood set a very high standard with Mystic River Letters From Iwo Jima and Million Dollar Baby and this one isnt quite at that level.

One of the things we learn about that bone-crunching sport comes in the form of a wry joke Soccer is a gentlemans game played by hooligans while rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen. Clint Eastwoods new movie is an inspirational game played by Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as the captain of a South African rugby team. Its also a win-win situation in which a mainstream feature works equally well as stirring entertainment and a history lesson about a remarkable convergence of sports and statesmanship. The time is 1995. Nelson Mandela a free man after 27 years in prison has just become president of a postapartheid South Africa thats still in racial turmoil. To help unify the nation Mandela embraces the most unlikely of popular causes a team called the Springboks that has been a symbol of white supremacy. ENLARGE Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby player Francois Pienaar in Invictus. Warner Bros. This may sound like some high-concept notion concocted by a Hollywood studio but the notion was Mandelas from the start--hed been a passionate athlete as a young man--and Anthony Peckhams script takes no more than reasonable liberties with the solid reporting of John Carlins book ""Playing the Enemy."" South Africas first black president did reach out to inspire the teams white captain Francois Pienaar; the team did shake off its losing ways thereby gaining the devotion of black and white fans alike and the Springboks did against huge odds defeat a supposedly invincible New Zealand team to win the 1995 World Cup championship. (Its even true that during the final game a South African Airways jumbo jet buzzed the stadium as the film depicts with the words ""Good Luck Bokke"" painted on the underside of its wings.) Factual truth doesnt guarantee effective drama but ""Invictus"" has something else going for it the convergence of a great actor and a great character. Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela is like a virtuoso playing Bach on a Stradivarius while moving serenely around the room. Beyond the warmth the humor and the phenomenally accurate vocal rhythms Mr. Freeman embodies Mr. Mandelas quiet moral authority and his capacity for forgiveness. Though the film often flirts with sanctification the actor resists it with quiet humanity. Though Mr. Peckhams script serves up didacticism by the large mouthful--""In order to build our nation we must all exceed our expectations"" Mandela tells Pienaar--the words emerge from Mr. Freemans mouth as heartfelt eloquence. Matt Damon acquits himself honorably too both as an Afrikaner athlete opening up to the revolution around him and a strong physical presence on the field. A strong enough presence that is to compensate for a shaky sense of the star actually playing on the team. The filmmaking is undistinguished at best--not just Clint Eastwoods stiff slow-paced direction but the cinematography and the music which comes around slowly to tapping the richness of African sources. And the charms of rugby are as opaque at the end as they were at the start. Yet the remarkable thing about ""Invictus"" apart from the fact that it got made--thanks to Messrs. Eastwood and Freeman--is that its substance so thoroughly transcends its technique. (The film takes its title which means unconquered from the William Ernest Henley poem that occupied a place of honor on Nelson Mandelas prison wall.) The story uses the presidents new squad of bodyguards as a microcosm of South African society--black and white they are not a congenial group--and the device is astute. To watch this Mandela moving through crowds that may love him or loathe him is to understand the danger he lived with--though we know he was not assassinated the spectacle of a black president in public places has an eerie resonance--and the state of grace he continues to live in. The Lovely Bones Peter Jacksons film version of ""The Lovely Bones"" like Alice Sebolds widely admired novel is partly set in an Inbetween that occupies an ethereal space between heaven and earth; its the vantage point from which the young heroine watches over her family after her death. I watched the film in an agitated space between engrossed and aghast. I dont know how you give yourself fully to a film or a book that turns on a child being murdered by a monstrous pervert. I mean that literally not judgmentally. I dont know how to do it and didnt want to do it so Im not one of those who found the novel an expression of religious faith. Still theres much for anyone to admire in the film starting with several superb performances Saoirse Ronan as Susie the anguishingly innocent victim; Stanley Tucci as Mr. Harvey Susies killer and a diabolical machine doing a convincing impersonation of a human being; Mark Wahlberg as Susies father; Rachel Weisz as her mother; and Rose McIver as her younger sister. (Susan Sarandon plays Susies lusty grandmother a sort of Annie Savoy gone to seed; it might have been better if she hadnt.) ""I loved the way a photo could capture a moment before it was gone"" Susie says she had wanted to be a photographer and accidentally snapped a shot of her killer-to-be. Mr. Jackson and his cinematographer Andrew Lesnie capture some lovely moments Susie watching her father build a ship in a bottle; the sweet expression on her face as she bicycles past her home Instamatic at the ready; her wonderment when as a little girl she contemplates a penguin inside a snow globe. But the details of her death are horrific even though were spared the worst of them. (The most terrifying shot may be the most placid; her killer a moist towel over his face enjoying a soak in a hot tub). The back-and forth structure of the narrative--Susie living life Susie observing life--can be maddening. And the film doesnt sustain much interest as a detective story even though it devotes a lot of time to solving the crime. Then theres the problem of that Inbetween. ENLARGE Saoirse Ronan is a murder victim in The Lovely Bones. DreamWorks Studios Reading the book we create our own vision of it; thats the unique magic of literature. Watching the play that strongly influenced the book Thornton Wilders ""Our Town"" we can do something of the same since the stage is bare and the governing principle is simplicity verging on austerity. But simplicity is not to put it mildly the principle that governs Mr. Jacksons movie. Mr. Jackson is of course our reigning master of fantasy; his ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a landmark in the history of cinema. Its easy to see why he might have been attracted to ""The Lovely Bones"" which shares the themes of fantasy and murder with ""Heavenly Creatures"" the brilliant 1994 feature that put him on the international map. And at this point in his working life he can use the prodigious digital resources of Weta his production facility to conjure up infinite worlds of special effects. Which heaven help us is exactly what hes done to visualize the Inbetween. The result is dumbfounding and ludicrous in equal measure a too-muchness that makes the excesses of ""What Dreams May Come"" seem downright spartan. If Readers Digest did music videos they might look like this. The screen pulses with bathos and swirls with surreal images some of them shamelessly intercut with the life of Susies bereaved family on earth--giant ships in giant bottles fields of daisies butterflies cute dogs cherry blossoms baobab trees out of ""The Little Prince"" a hot-air balloon ice sculptures snow-covered mountains a gazebo in a lake the same gazebo in a corn field the same field lighted by a lighthouse. By the time Susie finally ascended to the highest realm I was not only aghast but so exhausted by her surfeit of experience that I heard as if touched by magic myself those deathless lyrics from Talking Heads ""Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens...."" Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Olympia (1938) Heres another case though a radically different one of sports serving politics. Leni Riefenstahl a singular artist and Hitlers favorite filmmaker used the occasion of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin for this documentary testament to the beauty of the human body and the power of athletic will. (Shed already done her phenomenal best to sanctify Hitler in ""Triumph of the Will"" the greatest propaganda film ever made.) In his definitive biography ""Leni"" the late Steven Bach gives the film its due as art but sees its ""airbrushed portrait of the New Germany"" as the propaganda it was always meant to be. ENLARGE Kiss the Girls (1997) When the role of God came up for casting in ""Bruce Almighty"" Morgan Freeman was a natural choice if only for his peerlessly mellifluous voice. In ""Kiss the Girls"" a warmed-over ""Silence of the Lambs"" directed by Gary Fleder Mr. Freeman meets his vocal match in Ashley Judd who is audibly her mothers daughter. He plays a cop and forensic psychologist searching for his missing niece one of several young and talented women presumed to have crossed a predators path. Ms. Judd is a quick-thinking kickboxing physician who manages to escape after a masked monster abducts her to his underground lair. ENLARGE Atonement (2007) In this screen version of Ian McEwans novel which Joe Wright directed from an adaptation by Christopher Hampton Saoirse Ronan is Briony the precocious 13-year-old who puts the plot in motion by jumping to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse; she lacks any understanding of adult behavior that might put what she thinks shes seen in sensible context. Keira Knightley is Cecilia Brionys older sister and James McAvoy is Robbie the talented son of a servant; theyre the star-crossed lovers of the piece. ""Atonement"" is romantic intelligent and finally shattering in its sweep and thematic complexity. --Joe Morgenstern Find related television listings at LocateTV.

(Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 10 2009 627 PM Title Invictus Morgan Freemans performance as Nelson Mandela in ""Invictus"" is like Clint Eastwoods film as a whole constructed of deliberate decisions and never feels false. Freeman is so in-tune with the former South African presidents persona you cant take your eyes off him.Its no coincidence then that Eastwood doesnt spend too much time on the playing field in this drama adapted from John Carlins 2008 book ""Playing the Enemy"" about Mandelas efforts to unite his country around hosting and winning the 1995 rugby World Cup. Eastwood knows that even as we see team huddles and lateral passes were always aware of what Mandela is feeling and why.The movie takes place four years after Mandela walked out of the cell where the apartheid government kept him for nearly three decades and only months into his presidency when the 77-year-old leader was wrestling with yet another layer of division in South Africa after he and the African National Congress came to power.Mandela believes the countrys rugby team the Springboks could inspire a new sense of patriotism especially to nervous whites who hadnt voted for him in the numbers blacks did. Though the team and their colors are beloved by Afrikaners anti-apartheid forces favored a symbolic boycott. So Mandela works with Springboks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon sturdy as always) to make a World Cup win a symbol to the world that the past is done and there is now one South Africa.Did the story represent to Eastwood a chance to reflect on the U.S. and the Obama era? Perhaps though Eastwood isnt the type to push a comparison even if hed planned it. More likely Americas great filmmaking oak just has a savvy sense of timing.He also knows from actors. Freeman Eastwoods ""Unforgiven"" co-star finds the smart strategist living inside Mandela. The 72-year-old Oscar-winner (for Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"") slows himself down some and stoops a bit to play Mandela but you always see him thinking. In his scenes with Damon -- who makes Pienaar a quiet new-generation hero even when the rugby captain has little to do but rally his team and face his separatist family -- Freemans Mandela is impossible to say no to. His smile is stronger than Pienaars athletic prowess.The movie has a cliched moment or two especially in later scenes with Mandelas white and black bodyguards. Yet when Freeman is front and center ""Invictus"" -- its name taken from the poem Mandela says helped him survive 27 years in prison -- is absolutely magnetic.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

When Nelson Mandela won South Africas highest office many Afrikaners feared turmoil and reprisals. Some of his supporters expected a stern payback for the nations white minority after generations of apartheid. He kept both factions off-balance while aiming for the big score a united nation making a clean break from its past. Alongside his internal and international initiatives Mandela sought a symbol all South Africans could rally around. He found it in the Springboks the virtually all-white national rugby team. Their record was spotty and the nations blacks disdained the team as a holdover from the days of white minority rule. But if they could be prodded into the championship playoffs they could be a unifying symbol of national pride. Clint Eastwoods ""Invictus"" tells this tale in a sturdy straightforward agreeably square manner. Its a film of big themes played out on a grand scale a story of races and generations making an effort to connect. The setting is unusual but its told in a style thats immediate and understandable never opting for heroism at the expense of authenticity. Where others might imply Eastwood has little concern for subtlety at least concerning the big-picture issues. When needed he has message songs cheering crowds and Morgan Freeman reciting ""I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul"" to drive his point home. As Mandela Freeman gives a performance of triumphant intelligence. His presence is commanding yet modest and decent the sensitive father figure incarnate. Whenever he encounters a foe he speaks in a tranquil hypnotic tone gently breaking his opponent as if he were a beautiful horse. When he first strides into the presidential offices his predecessors staff greets him with cold reluctance. With a few conciliatory words he persuades them to stay on and do their best work for their country. He would rather convert an adversary than defeat him. This film should be required viewing for anyone who wants to run a government. Matt Damon is convincing as the captain of the Springboks a wary fellow who becomes ever more humane as the film moves along. Hes here not to score a star turn but to serve the story with a couple of (impeccably accented) go-team speeches. His pivotal scene is one where hes virtually silent a soul-searching visit to Mandelas old cell and rock quarry in Robben Island Prison the crucible that transformed him from a hotheaded revolutionary to a disciplined pragmatist. With his blocky frame Damon looks like he can hold his own in the bruising rugby scrimmages. ""Invictus"" is one of Eastwoods most uplifting and inspirational films. Its a reminder that on the fields of sport and politics being the coach is a lot more than diagramming plays. Its about leadership and helping people grow and getting individuals to work together. The film keeps returning to a keynote of optimism but its not facile. This is optimism of a carefully considered and convincingly argued kind the sort that only a humanist whos spent a long life watching civilization betray its potential can honestly express. Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures Invictus ""Invictus"" has its flaws to be sure. Mandelas warts are quickly passed over and the rugby play could have a more urgent and elegant flow. But these are trifles. Anyone who is not moved by this film has something broken in his chest where his heart ought to be.

Across the road on a muddy field weedy black youths in nondescript shirts kick around a soccer ball.It is the day after 27 long years that Nelson Mandela is released from prison. And as the car carrying him tools down the highway between the two fields the cheers of the soccer players are drowned out by the jeers of the rugby folk.Like his Gran Torino Clint Eastwoods new film Invictus (Latin for ""unconquered"") is about a civic elder seeking creative solutions to the problems of intolerance.The protagonist of Gran Torino is a crusty widower at first suspicious then supportive of his immigrant neighbors. The central figure of Invictus is serene loner Mandela (Morgan Freeman superlative) in 1995 the newly elected president of South Africa looking for a means of uniting a nation torn by apartheid suspicion and racial hatred.Mandelas election had created the new South Africa; it was his job to create the new South African. Eastwoods rousing unapologetically schmaltzy sports inspirational shows us how the statesman seized upon the gladiatorial rites of rugby as a means to achieve this unlikely goal.It may look like a movie-of-the-week and it certainly has some wincingly bad musical passages but Invictus is an entertaining movie about a masterful piece of political theater. It sweeps the audience up in Mandelas strategic campaign to get the two sides of the South African chessboard - angry blacks and scared whites - rooting for the same team. And makes us root for them too.Invictus takes its title from the 19th-century poem about the man proud to be ""the master of my fate the captain of my soul.""William Ernest Henleys verse sustained Mandela during his long imprisonment for anti-apartheid activism a period when like most black South Africans he hated rugby because it was the rough sport of rougher apartheidists.In Eastwoods film based on John Carlins 2008 book Playing the Enemy Mandela handwrites the poem and gives it to Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) captain of Springbok South Africas rugby team hoping to inspire him.As always Freeman is a one-man charm offensive. He doesnt really look like Mandela or speak with the former South African presidents clipped musicality. Yet he is Mandela erect farsighted and firm declining to settle old scores in the hopes of scoring new goals.(Of Damons work which is fine let us just say that to a one-dimensional role he summons 11/2 dimensions.)At its heart Eastwoods movie is a parable of leadership.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The oft-quoted final lines of William Ernest Henleys 1875 poem ""Invictus read as follows ""I am the master of my fate/I am the captain of my soul. If that isnt a perfect summation of Clint Eastwoods career I dont know one that comes closer.Time and again the man has trusted his gut and gone his own way starring in Italian westerns turning a fascist cop into a pop icon directing films about jazz legends and lady boxers and heroic Japanese soldiers. Eastwood is the last lion of his era working at anything near his peak powers and every December now he drops a movie with the potential to shape the entire year preceding it. Hes Clint Eastwood dammit and if he wants to make a film about Nelson Mandelas love affair with rugby thats his business. At this stage of his career its ours too.""Invictus - named for the poem upon which Mandela relied for inner strength during 27 years of imprisonment - is not among Eastwoods greatest works but its a strong satisfying entry in a rarely seen genre The Civic Statuary movie. Based on John Carlins 2008 book ""Playing the Enemy Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation it presents the inspirational saga of the 1995 Rugby World Cup - the moment arguably when the two sides of post-apartheid South Africa came together as one - as a high-stakes national drama spurred by an unlikely alliance of men.Morgan Freeman plays Mandela - God being unavailable - and Matt Damon has been cast as Francois Pienaar captain of the South African rugby team the Springboks. ""Invictus opens with Mandelas 1990 release from prison then skips ahead four years to his inauguration as president when the country and the world hold their breath. Everyone expects a bloodbath; Pienaars casually racist father (Patrick Lyster) tells his son ""Theyre going to take our jobs and drive us into the sea. Just wait.""Invictus playfully defuses that initial tension by following Mandela on his first day in office registering the shock of the presidents black security chief (Tony Kgoroge) as hes ordered to share duties with a squad of white cops watching the surprise on the faces of the Afrikaaner government workers on learning they get to keep their jobs. Knowing hes working on a grand scale Eastwood daringly chooses restraint. He could have built Mandelas entrance into his new office into a major dramatic moment. Instead we get an uninflected medium shot of the new president silently gazing about him and we understand Hes measuring the precise distance from his cell to this room.""Reconciliation starts here Mandela insists and everyone black and white assumes hes kidding. Madiba - the beloved presidents clan name - cant really mean it can he? The film presents the statesman as a soft-spoken father figure who knows best a far-seeing puppetmaster who understands that bringing the races together is the only way forward and that sports is the only way to do that. So the plot machinery of ""Invictus kicks in when Mandela elects to save the predominantly white Springboks from being disbanded by the countrys new sports administration - ""in this instance the people are wrong he says - and calls Pienaar in for a little chat. The team has long been a symbol of apartheid in the eyes of the countrys black majority who historically have rooted for anyone but the Boks. Now Mandela wants them to win the Cup and he wants everyone to get behind the notion of ""one team one country.Can a story on this scale function as compelling drama? I actually think thats what interests Eastwood the most here the challenge of making historical figures move with the grace of remembered life. Freeman portrays Mandela not as a saint but as a man who knows he has the political freedom of being seen as one; its a majestically two-dimensional performance with glimpses of a third dimension peeking through.Damon has both the easier and harder job. Easier because he has freer rein to invent the less-famous Pienaar (to some degree this is a matter of technique blonde dye job check; solid Boer accent check); harder because Anthony Peckhams script doesnt give the young captain much inner life. Such is the built-in difficulty of Civic Statuary films in which public figures are judged by their marks on history - on their actions not their emotions.And Pienaar is a jock an honorable and intelligent man whose depths seem unruffled by doubt. Hes there to win. The drama lies not in the characters understanding of the ghosts that plague his new mentor (literally so in one ham-handed scene) but in coaxing the Springboks into backing the presidents playbook by learning the new national anthem and teaching rugby clinics in the townships.Its in those sequences that we see Mandelas vision of a new South Africa coalesce. Eastwood generally restrains himself from easy sentiment (some glutinous pop songs are repeat offenders) and strikingly he dispenses with the usual sequence where the rules of an unfamiliar game are explained to us Yanks. You dont need to know rugby to appreciate whats at stake here.Despite the loose focus on the two men ""Invictus is structured as a portrait of a country in chaotic but hopeful transition. The film spends a lot of time with the security staff while they get to know each other as professionals as men as human beings. Scenes with Mandelas disapproving daughter (Bonnie Henna) and fretful secretary (Adjoa Andoh) hint at the fragile coalition behind the novice politician. As the climactic game is played out Eastwood lets his camera roam all over South Africa taking in a national audience forged by excitement and pride.Of course theres a climactic game as there was in real life even if ""Invictus ignores the historical side dramas. (Were the New Zealand All-Blacks - named for their jerseys not their skin color - suffering from food poisoning that day? Sorry the movie doesnt care.) Eastwood lets himself go overboard in the final moments putting the action on the field and across South Africa into portentous slow motion and cueing the BAM BAM BAM of the close-up time clock. Once again though we understand. There are times for restraint and there are times - such as a fractured nation at last becoming master of its fate - to go wild with joy.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heres a short version of history according to Invictus an adaptation of John Carlins book Playing The Enemy Nelson Mandela And The Game That Made A Nation. Freed from prison in 1990 Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) becomes the first president of South Africa elected after the end of apartheid. Presiding over an uneasily united nation he focuses primarily on rugby--with the occasional diplomatic trip abroad--and on insuring that the Springboks the national team no favorite among black South Africans does well in the South Africa-hosted 1995 World Cup. Meanwhile the Springboks struggle much to the frustration of their captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Then Pienaar meets Mandela and the teams luck turns around. Its a simplistic superficial approach to a real-life story that marginalizes most historical details not involving scrums and tackles. Its also pretty effective in spite of the gloss. Clint Eastwood brings his usual late-career leisureliness behind the camera to the movie in an initially frustrating approach that becomes increasingly satisfying as the film moves along. Eastwood lets the cameras roll and roll as Mandelas longtime security guards and their newly assigned white co-workers men who not long ago worked against anti-apartheid protesters eye each other uneasily. But the time spent yields rewards as the relationships between the men evolve over the course of the film especially during the climactic championship game. Men who once had every reason to hate each other wind up united by a common desire--a need really--to watch the home team win. In the grand scheme winning means much less than creating smart compassionate government policies but its symbolic value is impossible to overstate. Invictus doesnt have much interest in portraying history with any depth but it gets how seemingly frivolous interests can unite people. Apart from the excitingly executed rugby scenes Damon isnt given much to do compared to most headlining actors. Nor is Freeman for that matter; the film has little interest in getting to know the man beneath the canny statesmanship. But both leads convey a sense of quiet depths unspoken negotiations and a will to change the world. In an early scene Pienaars bigoted father speaks bleakly of a post-apartheid South Africa as if talking about the end of life as he knows it. By the end of the film hes been proven right but not in the way he expected.

Actually Invictus refers to a William Ernest Henley poem that provided Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) inspiration during his 27 years in prison. Mandela gives a copy to Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) captain of the national rugby team hoping it will serve a similar purpose for him. The two join forces leading the South African team to a World Cup victory and uniting a nation. MORE Art imitates life in timely Invictus TRAILER See how Eastwood fuses political tale and sports story Director Clint Eastwood cleverly fuses a political tale and a sports story and serves fact-based inspiration but nothing so overbearing that you feel battered by uplift. And while Mandelas early days as president of South Africa are by any definition worthy and enthralling the sport he has chosen to spotlight -- rugby -- is not. Mandela is an easy sell but the violent and hard-to-suss-out game is another matter. And yet Eastwood manages to make rugby exciting to watch though the scenes of the World Cup final drag on. But the key to Invictus is not players running around on a field. Its two stellar performances and a story that stirs hearts and intrigues minds. Its hard to imagine anyone besides Freeman playing Mandela. He could have coasted on his voice his charm and expressive face. But he becomes Mandela and we get a window into the psyche of one of the worlds most stirring leaders. Damon is a rare leading man who also is a viable character actor. This fall he disappeared into the role of an eccentric whistle-blower in The Informant He shines again as the Springboks captain a far less showy role. Invictus provides the context leading up to Mandelas historic 1994 election. But it doesnt try to tell the definitive story of his political career. Eastwood focuses on one critical chapter. Eastwood deftly conveys a country still struggling with apartheid. Mandela liked to get up before dawn. The morning after he is elected in an illustrative scene he walks briskly down quiet Johannesburg streets while his bodyguards scramble watchful and primed for repercussions. Invictus which is Latin for ""unconquered"" gives the poem several meanings in the context of the film. It also applies to Eastwood who as one of Americas greatest storytellers finds enthralling tales and fashions them with finesse and an indomitable spirit.

"Invictus | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; invictus ) Invictus (United States 2009) December 08 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli With the election of Barack Obama we have apparently entered a kinder gentler world in which films about racial harmony and goodwill to all men are becoming commonplace (at least during awards season). How else to explain the presence of both The Blind Side and Invictus within the first year of Obamas term? Both are transparent Oscar bait - they are inspirational and earnest but each preaches a little too loudly. Thats one of two problems with Invictus it makes its point early about the power of sports as a force of unification then beats us over the head by repeating that idea ad nauseam. The second issue is that the movie is poorly edited; the inclusion of too much extraneous material adds about 20 minutes to the length and results in parts of the story feeling unfocused. Still the overall experience is uplifting and enjoyable. History has pre-determined the outcome but flaws aside Eastwood has crafted something that works both as a sports drama and as an examination of the birth pains of the racially unified South Africa. Invictus (the title is Latin for ""unconquered"") opens with the 1994 ascension of Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) to the presidency of South Africa. With apartheid officially ended Mandela must work to achieve harmony through unification. Some of his methods are unconventional such as pushing for the South African rugby team the Springboks to win the 1995 World Cup which is being hosted in South Africa. Led by tough-as-nails player Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) the team competes far better than expected and the players learn not only tolerance but how to become heroes and role models for both white and black South Africans. The film comes complete with heavy doses of the behind-the-scenes machinations of politics. For example there is a strong push within South Africa to disband the Springboks and ban their gold-and-green colors. Beloved primarily by Afrikaners (they have only one black player) the team symbolizes to some a residue of apartheid. Mandela however argues that eliminating the Springboks would antagonize and further alienate the white population - something he does not want to do. Instead he campaigns for the team to be embraced not only by its core fans but by blacks as well. As a result their participation in the World Cup becomes a source of national pride irrespective of skin color. Invictus incorporates tangential subplots that accomplish little beyond inflating the running time. One involves the integration of the Presidents security forces. Aside from mirroring the countrys turmoil this offers little thats new or interesting especially since theres no payoff. The way these scenes are presented we are misdirected into believing there will be an attempt on Mandelas life. When that doesnt happen were left wondering why so much time is spent on these secondary characters. An associated problem is that theres some unease in the marriage between the account of Mandelas first year in office and the traditional sports story. There are connections but they are clumsily introduced. At times Invictus seems like two movies compressed into one. The only reasonably developed character is Mandela. The only reason we know who Francois Pienaar is is because hes played by Matt Damon. His character traits are plays rugby is respected by his fellows comes to believe in Mandela and has an attractive wife. And hes among the most fully fleshed out of the players. So instead of spending time to enhance individuals like Pienaar the screenplay funnels time and energy to examples of how the black and white members of the Presidents bodyguard team come to trust each other. Theres no debating that the message of Invictus is worthy but there are times when its repetition elevates it to a level thats almost sanctimonious. Eastwood goes overboard in depicting the unifying power of sports. The most cloying example is a little black boy who hangs around a taxi to hear the broadcast of the game on the car radio. At first the white driver tries to shoo him away. By the end of the game they are celebrating together. The point has been adequately made without this additional pointless display of theatrics. If these criticisms seem a bit harsh its because the movie had the potential to be one of the truly great inspirational sports movies. Although its flaws keep it from achieving that level its still a strong piece of mass market filmmaking. The message is undeniably positive there are enough details about the difficulties faced by Mandela to recall how divisive a time it was in South Africa and everything builds to the kind of rousing climax that a sports movie demands. Invictus is engaging enough that its easy to forgive if not overlook its problems. Like The Blind Side it offers a more hopeful view of humanity than something like 2012. Frank Capra would be pleased.

Posted December 18 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Clint Eastwoods Invictus sounds like a drama of paint-by-numbers nobility the kind that can make you dread awards season. It stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela -- thats like a monument playing a monument -- and though the film is set during the stormy period just after Mandela was elected South Africas president in 1994 (he was 75) its not a complex portrait of a society in transition. Its a sports drama that hinges on Mandelas attempt to rouse and unify the nation by turning its nearly all-white rugby team -- the Springboks -- into the 1995 World Cup champions. Since that strategy centered on Mandelas alliance with the teams captain Francois Pienaar Invictus is yet another movie that refracts black struggle through the eyes of a white hero -- in this case Matt Damon looking so blond that hes practically Aryan. Ladies and gentlemen line up those Oscars But before we overdose on cynicism let me say that Invictus while it does have moments of stodgy uplift is more fascinating -- and intelligent and moving -- than it sounds. Its really about the inner workings of politics and about how Mandela made a hugely counterintuitive decision to embrace the Springboks even though they were despised by the nations black majority. He knew that supporting the ""enemy"" would ? symbolize a laying down of old hatreds thus paving the way for a new nation. Its thrilling to watch Freeman do his perfect imitation of Mandelas lordly formal cadences. Thats because Freeman captures the mind behind the manners Mandela the crafty persuader who orchestrated his fan worship of the Springboks as an act of high-wire rebellion. Invictus often suggests a spiritual link between Mandelas cunning and the strategies of Barack Obama with a rough parallel between the films righteously angry black South Africans and the progressives whom Obama wont appease. The films speechifying is at times overexplicit yet Freeman lets the words breathe and Damon as the cautious Afrikaner brought to a higher place by Mandelas authority acts with a ? coolly impassive fervor. And how is Invictus as a sports movie? Lets just say that its lump-in-the-throat climax is predictable but that doesnt mean its less than earned.

And Freeman is fantastic. But Eastwood too often veers into trite territory undercutting some of the storys power. An unlikely World Cup run may be a soothing balm on a nations wounds but its not a cure-all no matter how inspiring it may be. The film begins with Mandelas release from prison and follows through to his election as president of South Africa after apartheid is finally abolished. These scenes are both stirring as a reminder of Mandelas courage and perseverance and horrifying as a reminder that its been less than 20 years since apartheid ceased to exist. That knowledge will hover both directly and indirectly over the rest of the film as it does Mandelas tenure as president. Apartheid may be outlawed but changing laws does not change mens hearts certainly not immediately. That point is made when a motorcade carrying Mandela drives by on a street that separates two fields. On one well-appointed White boys practice rugby. Across the road Black boys in rags play soccer. As Mandela drives by they watch in awe. On the other side the White coach tells a player that this day will be remembered as when the country went to the dogs. Thats powerful stuff and ""Invictus"" could use more of it. Meanwhile we see the national rugby team known as the Springboks suffer what would appear to be another in a string of humiliating losses. The teams captain Francois Pienaar (an understated Matt Damon) is frustrated naturally and the teams chances in the 1995 rugby World Cup look dire. But the Springboks are more than a rugby team. For Black South Africans its a symbol of White oppression and they want the team dismantled the colors and the name changed. Mandela wont hear of it. He sees opportunity where others see conflict; if everyone Black and White can support these underdogs in the World Cup then what cant they do together? Of course theres the not-inconsiderable detail of winning or even fielding a decent team. Pienaar is surprised to get a phone call one day The president wants to meet him. Mandelas talk with Pienaar is inspirational; he talks to him about the poem that gives the film its name and gave him strength in prison. The talk is also evidently magical. The team suddenly gets better. And not just a little better but a lot. The rugby footage is exciting even if you know the outcome. And Freeman doesnt make Mandela out to be a saint (in case you miss the point one of his bodyguards conveniently drives the point home) but a decent fiercely intelligent man who has overcome unthinkable hardships. He isnt just wise. Hes wise in the ways of politics and that serves him well. At times though the story is too pat. Yes its based on fact but Eastwood must necessarily compress time making it seem as if everything comes together too smoothly too soon. Some of the elements work beautifully as when a Black boy outside the stadium tries to come up with reasons to hang around the police car filled with White cops listening to the game on the radio. Others - bodyguards of different races who snipe at each other throughout but hug during the big match - are too obvious. ""Invictus"" is not a great movie no matter how much you wish it might be. But it is a good one and in some ways an important one. History is often too fleeting particularly in an age in which we are bombarded with so much information so often its hard to keep track. Youll remember Freemans performance which is certainly notable. But youll also recall the struggle and sacrifice of Mandela and Blacks in South Africa and thats far more valuable. But this is a movie not a history lesson. And its on the movie front that it ultimately comes up short. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Also we could use a happy global moment and Eastwood picks one out of the otherwise rocky history of South Africa when the countrys first post-apartheid president stepped out of the jail where hed languished for 27 years and firmly set aside revenge politics in favor of national unity.More than most Mandela understood the cohesive power of the symbol--in this case the bright green uniform of the South African rugby team the Springboks echoing the flag equally beloved by whites and hated by blacks under apartheid. Adapted by South African writer Anthony Peckham from a book by former London Independent journalist John Carlin Invictus tells the story of how Mandela with help from the Afrikaner team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon gym-pumped into Michelin Man and oozing fair play) turned a World Cup rugby match into a moment of rainbow solidarity.Like every Eastwood production Invictus is stately handsomely mounted attentive to detail right down to the Marmite adorning the teams breakfast buffet and relentlessly conventional. As a portrait of a hero the movie effortlessly brings a lump to the throat (Freeman gives a subtly crafted performance that blends Mandelas physical frailty with his easy charm and cerebral wit); as history it is borderline daft and selective to the point of distortion. Its true that you cant shoehorn a nations history into a single movie but Peckhams dialogue stuffed with strenuously underlined exposition blazes an indecently fast trail from mutual suspicion to interracial love and understanding.The powerful dislike between Mandelas black and white bodyguards melts into reverence for their leader and joint cheerleading for the team. Within minutes of their enforced arrival in the shantytowns the Springboks (including Eastwoods cute son Scott who gets plenty of money shots) are happily hoisting adoring little black boys onto their shoulders. Pienaars parents maid gets tickets to the cup final where she and the mistress sit side-by-side rib-poking with every home-team score.Never mind that many white supremacists fled abroad to seethe in safety over the end of white privilege. Never mind that the ANC the very movement that had worked for years to free Mandela and bring down apartheid is confined here to a lone reductive scene that dismisses a complex resistance group as a bunch of thuggish ideologues. And Winnie Mandela who is no picnic but deserves a place in this story is kicked out of the movie altogether save for a couple of cheap gibes at her betrayal of her long-suffering husband. She and the extremist wing of the ANC have a right to more nuanced exposure in Invictus if only to acknowledge the unpalatable truth that apartheid manufactured more monsters than it did dignified heroes with forgiveness in their hearts.That Mandela is a great man is beyond dispute--but thats no excuse to position him in a Great Man theory of history. In the end Invictus becomes what almost every Eastwood movie becomes an inquiry into masculinity shaped in the directors own image with the answers already supplied.Eastwood cant play his own wounded hero this time but his perennial ideal is all here in Mandela the courtly gentleman Mandela the elderly yet still potent flirt Mandela the dry wit--above all in Mandela the rugged individualist who wont toe the PC line when duty suggests otherwise. Manning up in Eastwoodland has matured with age from ""Revenge is sweet"" (the final scene in Unforgiven) to ""The best revenge is living well."" Maybe but in real life thats not enough. Mandela befriended his prison guards and refused to make enemies of South African whites including his former tormentors. Yet for all his lovely manners his donations to worthy causes his insistence on pouring his own tea or even his high-minded dedication to reconciling former enemies South Africa today is a muddle of hope and despair.For the record I cried my way through the climactic game with all its kitschy slow-mo lopes around the pitch its roar of the crowd and peripheral melodrama. But I came out feeling had. How Invictus will play in the North American multiplex (foreign sport + foreign country = not promising) is a lot less interesting than its reception in Johannesburg and--perhaps more significantly--in the townships where conditions remain abysmal and communities are decimated by a long-untended AIDS epidemic that makes our own crisis look like a tea party. Todays South Africa has been many decades in the making and it is the product not of one good man but of movements full of courageous men and women who almost certainly rose to power before they were ready. But as they say in the pitch meetings wheres the glamour in that?

The subject of this headline was not Barack Obama in 2008 but Nelson Mandela in 1994. He emerged from 27 years as a political prisoner to be voted into South Africas highest office ending decades of apartheid in a lightning flash of popular will. All he had to do was end crime create jobs ... and help the nations hapless rugby team the Springboks win a world championship. (See TIMEs photo-essay ""Nelson Mandela at 90."")Invictus which takes its title from the William Ernest Henley poem (""My head is bloody but unbowed"") that gave Mandela strength in jail has all the vectors of the sports-inspirational genre. Theres the impossibility of the odds the father figure whose quiet fervor wins over the players and the fans the star athlete (Damon as Francois Pienaar) who spurs his teammates to victory with a rousing speech ""Listen to your country ... This is our destiny."" What gives heft to the cliches in Anthony Peckhams screenplay based on the John Carlin book are the identity of the ""coach"" and the high stakes involved. Mandela believes that if all his citizens can becomes adherents of this national team -- long a symbol of apartheid -- then the country might truly be united. (See the latest news about movies at Techland.com.)If theres a whiff of colonialism in casting Hollywood stars as renowned South Africans the actors work hard to find strength and nuance in their roles. Damon beefed up for the occasion makes Pienaar a stalwart yet courtly figure. Freeman infuses Mandelas speeches with the same gentleness and gravity hes brought to his numerous God roles and the Visa Olympics commercials. But the real deity here is Eastwood still chugging away handsomely in his 80th year. Whod have thought that old Dirty Harry would with Letters from Iwo Jima and Invictus become Americas prime director of international trauma and triumph? See the 25 most important films on race.

Clint Eastwoods Invictus is not your ordinary sports movie though it comes to a rousing climax at the 1995 Rugby World Cup match between South Africa and New Zealand. The stakes are higher a nations unity hangs in the balance. Invictus (which means ""unconquered"") takes place at the intersection of sports and politics. Its hero is Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman naturally) who in the aftermath of apartheid has just been elected South Africas president after serving 27 years in prison. (Article continued below...)During his incarceration Mandela studied his Afrikaner enemies and was wise to the role sports played in the national psyche. South Africas less-than-sterling rugby team the Springbok was as beloved by whites as it was despised by the black population to whom it had become a symbol of oppression. Yet Mandela taking a huge political risk refuses to give in to his supporters demand that the team be dismantled and renamed. To do so he sees would only stoke fear and racial paranoia in the Afrikaner population. Enlisting the teams captain (Matt Damon) to his side Mandela challenges him to turn its losing ways around. His goal is to use rugby to bridge the racial divide in his country. Invictus is not a biopic; nor does it take us deep inside any of its characters--Eastwood views Mandela from a respectful middle distance. Its about strategic inspiration. We witness a politician at the top of his game Freemans wily Mandela is a master of charm and soft-spoken gravitas. Anthony Peckhams sturdy functional screenplay based on John Carlins book Playing the Enemy can be a bit on the nose (and the message songs Eastwood adds are overkill). Yet the lapses fade in the face of such a soul-stirring story--one that would be hard to believe if it were fiction. The wonder of Invictus is that it actually went down this way.

""Invictus"" is a very good story very well told. Shortly after Nelson Mandela emerged from 27 years in prison and became president of South Africa in 1994 he seized upon using a rugby World Cup the following year as an opportunity to rally the entire nation -- blacks and whites -- behind the far-fetched prospect of the home team winning it all. Inspirational on the face of it Clint Eastwoods film has a predictable trajectory but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history cultural impressions and emotion. The names of Eastwood and stars Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon should propel this absorbing Warner Bros. release to solid returns Stateside with even better prospects looming in many foreign markets where an unfamiliar sport and South African politics may pose less of a potential B.O. hurdle. Once again in his extraordinary late-career run Eastwood surprises with his choice of subject matter here joining a project Freeman had long hoped to realize. In fact the filmmaker has frequently dealt with racial issues in a conspicuously even-handed manner most notably in ""Bird"" and his calm equitable fair-minded directorial temperament dovetails beautifully with that of Mandela much of whose daily job as depicted here consisted of modifying and confounding the more extreme views of many of his countrymen on both side of the racial divide. Mandela is the lynchpin of ""Invictus"" whose title is Latin for ""unconquerable"" and comes from a stirring 1875 poem by British writer William Ernest Henley. Although far from a conventional biography Anthony Peckhams adaptation of John Carlins densely packed book ""Playing the Enemy"" commences with Mandelas extraordinary transition from imprisonment to the leadership of a country that easily could have fallen into a devastating civil war. As he takes office Mandela allows that his greatest challenge will be successfully relaxing the tension between black aspirations and white fears. Pic adroitly avoids becoming mired in the minutiae of political score-settling by summing up racial suspicions through the prism of the new presidents security detail. Mandelas longtime black bodyguards are shocked when their ""Comrade President"" forces them to work with some intimidating Afrikaners experienced toughs who until very recently were no doubt striking terror into the hearts of the black population. Directed by Eastwood with straightforward confidence the film is marbled with innumerable instances of Mandela disarming his presumed opponents while giving pause to those among his natural constituency who might be looking for some payback rather than intelligent restraint. Freeman a beautiful fit for the part even if he doesnt go all the way with the accent takes a little while to shake off the mans saintlike image and admittedly the role of such a hallowed contemporary figure does not invite too much complexity inner exploration or actorly elaboration. That said Freeman is a constant delight; gradually one comes to grasp Mandelas political calculations certitudes and risks the troubled personal life he keeps mostly out of sight and his extraordinary talent for bringing people around to his point of view. Where the rugby match is concerned that talent is manifested by how over tea Mandela personally appeals to the captain of the South African team the Springboks. A blond Afrikaner with no discernible politics Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) would just like to lift the squad from its present mediocrity. But Mandela quotes inspiringly from the poem -- ""I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul"" -- speaks of leading by example and exceeding expectations and leaves Pienaar astonished at the idea that they can dare to dream about winning the World Cup. Just as its disinclined to offer a primer on South African politics the film refrains from outlining the rules of rugby; the viewer just has to jump in and surmise that its something like a cross between soccer and American football. What the film conveys with tart economy is that rugby was a white game scorned by blacks; as one man puts it ""Soccer is a gentlemans game played by hooligans rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen."" In a magnificent irony the team the mostly white South African squad ultimately faces in the title match is a mostly white New Zealand team called (because of their uniforms) the All Blacks. The climactic faceoff played in front of 62000 fans at Johannesburgs Ellis Park Stadium roused by the presence of Mandela himself lasts 18 minutes of screen time; when such an event plays out like this in real life its often exclaimed that it could only have been scripted for the movies. Here its real life dictating the incredible scenario. With the exception of the meeting with Mandela and a couple of family scenes most of Damons screen time is spent in training or on the field and its meant as highest praise to say that if he werent a recognizable film star youd never think he were anything other than a South African rugby player. Beefed up a bit (or perhaps more accurately slimmed down somewhat from ""The Informant"") and employing at least to an outsiders ear an impeccable accent Damon blends in beautifully with his fellow players. Some of the most amusing and telling scenes throughout involve the bodyguards whose body language facial expressions and intonations of minimal lines convey much about the uncertain state of things in the country. Shot entirely on location in South Africa ""Invictus"" looks so natural and realistic that it will strike no one as a film dependent upon CGI and visual effects. In fact the climactic match would not have been possible without them as virtually the entire crowd was digitally added after the action was filmed in an empty stadium. You really cant tell. Tech contributions are solid down the line and local tunes fill out the discreetly supportive soundtrack.
