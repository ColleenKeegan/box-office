"Movie Review Disaster Movie - 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review Disaster Movie - 1 out of 5 stars Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Disaster Movie is the latest and most slap-dash of the movie parodies to atrophy out of the Scary Movie franchise. It shows more signs of the postpartum depression that these movies have felt since the Wayans Brothers gave them to Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and the stretch marks of trying to make fun of a movie genre that isnt exactly current ""with it"" or now.And lets stop with the pregnancy analogies right here no matter how tempting that ""about-as-funny-as-afterbirth"" gag seems. Disaster has maybe nine laughs in it most of them given birth by Crista Flanagans dead-on impersonation of the very pregnant title character in Juno.""Chilly Willy out L.L. not Cool J."" she blurts in that ""clever for clevers sake"" Juno style. ""Im more bloated than Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up or Fred Claus or Vince Vaughn"" And then the hacks who hacked this together make fun of anyone who actually makes the effort to write clever dialogue.Theyve cobbled together a Cloverfield plot with hints of I Am Legend The Day After Tomorrow a chipmunk zombie movie and 10001 B.C. And though Hannah Montana will Never Back Down even an Enchanted beatdown set in No Country for Old Men served up Zohan style wont prompt Hancock or The Love Guru to save us from our Night at the Museum or the end of the world the lead character Will (Matt Lanter zero charisma) dreams.That day of the apocalypse? Aug. 29 the day Disaster Movie opens.Whats interesting in these movies is that theyre no longer made by people who love movies or have any skill at making them. This is a random sample of Short Attention Span Nation randomness with pop culture rips on TV (My Super Sweet 16 High School Musical American Gladiators) gossip trainwrecks ( Amy Winehouse) music stars ( Justin Timberlake Michael Jackson) and viral video. That whole Sarah Silverman/Jimmy Kimmel ""Im (having sexual intercourse with) Matt Damon/Ben Affleck"" joke is played out in a tedious musical finale. Everybody needs a paycheck and chances are this will earn back its meager cost in one weekend. But one joke here seems the most relevant. A Hayden Christenson ( Jumper) look-alike is impaled on Prince Caspians mighty sword. Caspian stares at the actor-skewer on a stick and cracks ""Hes the guy who ruined Star Wars""Hey Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer youre the guys who ruined the Scary Movies Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel Disasters and Accidents Movies Entertainment Vince Vaughn Roger Moore The Love Guru (movie) Michael Jackson Pulse ShootingAll SectionsNewsSportsBusinessClassifiedEntertainmentTravel89deg","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-review-disaster-movie-roger-moore,0,291472.story",200,disastermovie0,disastermovie,orlandosentinel

Compared to anyone watching Disaster Movie he got off light. Rushed into production with no better drape for its threadbare gags than Cloverfield--unless you count such proud upholders of the Irwin Allen tradition as Juno Enchanted and High School Musical--this carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores. Visually an eyesore comically a much-lower-seated pain its the same as writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzers other (fill in the blank) movie parodies only somehow uglier and lazier. Ugliness and laziness can sometimes work to comedys advantage but not here--not when the level of inspiration is someone answering a Get Smart shoe phone only to smear his face with dog crap. Yes there are nods to Hannah Montana and ""Im Fucking Matt Damon""; yes Crista Flanagan does a spot-on Ellen Page--and yes you can feel the dead air in the theater as joke after so-called joke falls splat on the pavement. The bastards couldnt even find the energy to put an exclamation point after the title. Best text message sent from my screening (it wasnt me but I certainly sympathized) ""I want to die.""

Credit Jon Barren Farmer/Lionsgate ""Disaster Movie"" the latest disposable parody of disposable Hollywood movies has a shelf life of about five minutes tops which may be slightly longer than it took to come up with most of its gags.Scribbled and slapped together by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer this flailing free fall through recent pop culture begins with a parody of ""10000 B.C."" featuring ""Amy Winehouse"" as a saber-toothed tiger who pulls a crystal skull from her beehive hairdo. It winds up with ""Kung Fu Panda"" (dude in a furry suit) and ""Beowulf"" (naked dude who keeps yelling ""I am Beowulf"") running amok through ""Night at the Museum.""Along the way jokes fly on movies no one cared about the first time around (""Jumper"" ""Speed Racer"") obvious celebrity targets (Michael Jackson Sarah Jessica Parker) and gastrointestinal dysfunction. And there is a ""Juno"" figure who says things like ""That is so L L Not Cool J.""Do you get it Home Skillet? ""Disaster Movie"" does little more than congratulate its audience on recognizing the source of its riffs. ""High School Musical"" -- ha ha ha But it does manage a moment or two of chuckle-worthy dementia in one scene Alvin and the Chipmunk puppets appear out of nowhere for a heavy-metal number under the influence of rabies then settle on Juno to feast on her spine.""Disaster Movie"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has adult language adolescent innuendo and childish jokes.DISASTER MOVIEOpened on Friday nationwide.

In fairness you really have to work to achieve those odds. And Friedberg and Seltzer do work hard throwing every possible reference onscreen in the hopes that something somehow might stick. Unfortunately nothing ever does.CLICK TO VIEW MOVIES SILLIEST SPOOFSThe problem is that the two - who also boast ""Scary Movie"" ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" on their resumes - dont really see the need for anything as complicated as an actual joke.Taking parts of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" for its base the movie begins with a guy named Will (Matt Lanter) getting a doom-laden prophecy from an addled Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker). Apparently the world is about to end unless a stolen skull is returned to its rightful place. Wills girlfriend Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) works in the museum that holds the skulls altar so he has to get to her in time to save the planet. The plot though is just a clothesline on which to hang skits about various films and pop-culture personalities. ""Enchanted"" ""Juno"" ""Superbad"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" are among the movies mentioned while Jessica Simpson Justin Timberlake Dr. Phil and Michael Jackson look-alikes wander in and out with no particular purpose. Meanwhile the PG-13 rating dulls any potential edge. Just try not to cringe when the characters start singing about ""dating"" Matt Damon.Not only do the references feel tired the humor is absolutely exhausted. ""Sex and the Citys"" Sarah Jessica Parker is played by a man while Alvin and the other chipmunks turn out to be rabid. Since even the filmmakers realize that none of this is remotely amusing they regularly and randomly cut away to say a game of Twister between barely clad co-stars Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian.Lanter and Minnillo arent unlikable and Kardashians cleavage does earn its paycheck. But why would you watch a bad movie about better movies when you could just rent the originals instead?

"The references fly by but the time doesnt - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ParodyMOVIE REVIEW The references fly by but the time doesntSeptember 01 2008|Michael Ordona | Special to The Times The purported fun in ""Disaster Movie"" is in the relentless mashing up of pop-culture references In the first few minutes the film gropes dazedly for ""Armageddon"" ""10000 B.C."" ""American Gladiators"" ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and Amy Winehouse. Does it slow down from there? No no no.Thats really what ""Disaster Movie"" and the rest of its indistinguishable ilk are about racing mouth foaming to include as many films TV shows and celebrities as possible as quickly as possible hoping the audience doesnt notice how few actual jokes are beneath the laughs of recognition. Its a scattershot blast aimed at teens with an extremely short attention span and a girl-fighting fixation.But that is apparently enough to keep these review-proof opuses coming with no end in sight. Perhaps theyll eventually make one called ""Spoof Movie"" which would brilliantly parody the genre by being consistently funny.Even running out of suitable titles cant stop this juggernaut of mediocrity; not that the story should make a lick of sense but its essentially ""Cloverfield"" -- attractive twentysomethings trying to escape a cataclysm in the city. Presumably there was no money for creatures so its ""Disaster"" rather than ""Monster"" movie. Cue the smoke and shaking of cameras.The products not 100% giggle-free Several songs have amusing lyrics especially parodies of ""Juno"" and ""High School Musical."" Among the players utility infielder Ike Barinholtz sports at least seven impersonations of varying sufficiency (best Beowulf; worst ""No Country for Old Mens"" Anton Chigurh). Nicole Parkers singing shines as does her portrayal of the ""Enchanted"" princess as a squeaky-clean skank.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is how current it manages to be including references to ""The Dark Knight"" (well to Batman anyway) and just about every film to make back its budget in the last year -- and then it kicks ""Speed Racer"" and ""Love Guru"" while theyre down for good measure.--""Disaster Movie."" MPAA rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language drug references and comic violence. Running time 1 hour 30 minutes. In general release.

(Jon Barren Farmer) By Michael Hardy Globe Correspondent / August 30 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Disaster Movie"" written and directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer represents the best argument for overturning Hustler Magazine v. Falwell - the 1988 Supreme Court case that protects celebrity parodies - since well Hustler Magazine.Riding in on the shabby coattails of ""Scary Movie"" ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" the film lampoons shock-and-awe blockbusters from ""Armageddon"" to ""An Inconvenient Truth."" But it doesnt stop there. Like a 90-minute double-wide version of VH1s ""Best Week Ever"" ""Disaster"" references virtually every pop cultural phenomenon of the past five years from ""High School Musical"" to Dr. Phil. Why is Hannah Montana killed by a meteor? For the same reason that Indiana Jones is played by an African-American dwarf and Michael Jackson is discovered in Speed Racers trunk The filmmakers are idiots.Like a tripod ""Disaster"" stands on three legs feces humor urine humor and fake celebrities fighting each other. Carrie Bradshaw fights Juno. Alvin and the Chipmunks fight the princess from ""Enchanted."" Carmen Electra fights Kim Kardashian (sadly these two appear as themselves). None of this is remotely humorous but it does have a grim intensity as if the film were so busy moving on to the next unfunny joke that it doesnt have time to finish the last unfunny joke. Aiming at universal satire - the film takes wobbly aim at pederast priests cellphone commercials and fast food menu options - ""Disaster"" is less a film than Friedberg and Seltzers drunken belligerent rant against everything in the universe except themselves. Thats a shame because no one spoofed in the film - yes including Jessica Simpson - is more worthy of derision than the people responsible for making it.To say that ""Disaster"" relentlessly mocks homosexuals blacks and Asian people is merely to say that it is a contemporary comedy; crude bigoted jokes are Hollywoods current stock-in-trade and I suppose moviegoers might ask for a refund if ""Disaster"" didnt provide them. Gary ""G. Thang"" Johnson plays the films token black character with such evident relish for minstrelsy that he might as well be Al Jolson in blackface. And like carbuncular freshmen Friedberg and Seltzer can find no more eloquent expression of their contempt than the phrase ""thats gay."" ""American Gladiators""? Gay. Michael Jackson? Gay. ""Beowulf""? Definitely gay.So let me sum up ""Disaster Movie"" in language that Friedberg Seltzer and their pubescent fans can understand Gayest. Movie. Ever.

It should have been called I Love the First Half of 2008. Since many of the targets (Cloverfield Hancock Kung Fu Panda) already have a cheeky self-consciousness the comedy rarely seems more than a hasty patchwork of cheap-shot allusions. But a few arrows hit their marks. The movie is merciless sending up Junos self-satisfied hipster gobbledygook and its quite funny to see Hannah Montana still promoting her tie-in products as she lies crushed and dying under a meteor.

Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than ""Disaster Movie"" yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce from the unfortunately prolific writing-directing team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Much like their previous ""Date Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" new effort is a crazy-quilt of scattershot satirical jabs at various contempo (and a few not-so-contempo) films TV series and overexposed celebrities. The big difference this time is the air of desperation is even more pronounced than the lack of inspiration. Altogether worthy of its end-of-summer dump by Lionsgate this lame trifle may generate modest homevid biz. Or not. Wispy plot -- basically a recycling of stale elements from ""Deep Impact"" and ""Twister"" -- serves merely as an excuse to propel cartoonish leads through episodes and encounters that feebly spoof everything from ""The Dark Knight"" to ""10000 B.C."" ""Enchanted"" to ""High School Musical."" Pic also takes aim at easy targets -- Dr. Phil Michael Jackson Hannah Montana -- but repeatedly misses. Amid the grimly unamusing chaos Crista Flanagan somehow scores a few chuckles with her spot-on parody of Ellen Pages star turn in ""Juno."" Production values appear marginally more upscale than in previous Friedberg-Seltzer pics. Disaster MovieProductionA Lionsgate release presented with Grosvenor Park of a 3 in the Box production.

Share Tweet Barely qualifying as parody let alone satire the latest salvo from the Date Movie duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer is a collection of pop-culture references so broad and obvious they struggle to qualify as jokes. Plucking the signature scenes from a grab bag of recent hit movies Disaster Movie strings them together with a plot that has commitment-phobic Matt Lanter dodging earth-destroying asteroids to reunite with estranged squeeze Vanessa Minnillo. Although that plot is obviously swiped from Cloverfield Friedberg and Seltzer never actually get around to spoofing the movies first-person shakycam gimmick; theyre too busy taking potshots at sitting ducks. Take that Michael Jackson Although a handful of D-list celebs (Carmen Electra Kim Kardashian) show up as themselves the vast majority of the celebrity impressions are of the ""Look Its..."" variety which is often the only way to tell who youre supposed to be looking at. Coming barely seven months after Meet The Spartans Disaster Movie has the feel of make-work churned out on deadline. Friedberg and Seltzer give no indication theyve actually watched most of the movies theyre parodying the gags so to speak invariably involve some character (like say No Country For Old Mens Anton Chigurh) abruptly showing up quoting a few lines from the trailer and then scurrying offstage before anyone might have to write them something original. The flood of scattershot references is so witless it makes Family Guy look like Jonathan Swift. When the well runs dry (which needless to say is often) the movie falls back on fight scenes. Think the idea of Juno roundhouse-kicking Sex And The Citys Carrie Bradshaw is a hoot and a half? Youve come to the right place. At the risk of encouraging the dastardly duo to strike again the movie does have some exceedingly rare bright spots Crista Flanagans Ellen Page impression is good enough to sustain a handful of scenes and the attack by a bloodthirsty Alvin and the Chipmunks is sufficiently random to pass as inspired. But even at barely over an hour--padded out to contractual feature length with a series of outtakes that frightening thought werent funny enough to make the final cut--the movie goes flat in record time. Its too easy to say Disaster Movie deserves its title but why put more effort into trashing it than the filmmakers did into writing it?
