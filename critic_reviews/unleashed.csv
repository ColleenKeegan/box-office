Jet Lis scary destructive powers are soon in evidence as he beats sundry low-lifes to a powder whenever his Glasgow crime-lord master Bob Hoskins unhooks his studded collar and lets him off the leash. He is in effect a human pit-bull an orphan trained since infancy to inflict pain without reason. Until that is circumstances separate him from his owner and hes given shelter by blind piano-tuner Morgan Freeman. Might the tinkling of the ivories soothe this savage beast and reclaim his humanity? Yes Unleashed sounds beyond parody yet somehow it neither takes itself too seriously nor makes fun of the material. While the kinetic direction and Lis lightning-fast reflexes deliver suitably crunching fight sequences the leading man also touchingly suggests the innocent child beneath his fearsome exterior in a performance which stands comparison with the surprisingly alert work of his illustrious co-stars. And its hard not to have a soft spot for a movie which balances axe-swinging bone-snapping mayhem with a key role for a classical piano repertoire.

"Unleashed | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unleashed ) Unleashed (France/United States/United Kingdom/Hong Kong 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Unleashed is two radically different movies fused into one. On their own each of the films might have stood a chance of working but brought together in concert the radical shifts in tone create a weird dichotomy that will distract and disorient some viewers. As if that isnt bad enough the storyline contains elements that are so patently ridiculous that you half-expect members of Monty Pythons troupe to show up on screen to say ""And now for something completely differenta|"" Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) and screenwriter Luc Besson (The Professional) make unmistakable use of the three-act structure. The divisions are clear. Act I is grim and violent. Act II is a twist on Pygmalion. Then the violence is back with a vengeance in Act III. One senses that those who appreciate the middle 45 minutes of the film will be turned off by the bookend sections. And actor Jet Lis core constituency which expects lots of martial arts fight scenes will be mystified by why the film eliminates those elements for more than half of its running length. Those expecting a typical action movie may find themselves drifting off to sleep around Unleasheds midpoint. If Unleashed deserves praise its for being different. Leterrier and Besson press forward heedless of whether theyre bringing the audience with them. When the movie is kinetic the action is furious. When its dramatic it radiates an old-fashioned sweetness. The two divergent elements sort-of meet in the films climactic 20 minutes but their wedding is an unsettled and uncertain affair. I sense that its bad to have both testosterone and estrogen pumping through the bloodstream at the same time. Jet Li is Danny a martial arts enforcer who has been trained by mobster Bart (Bob Hoskins) to attack without mercy whenever his dog collar is removed. (Insert obligatory Samp;M joke here.) Danny is Barts hound docile when wearing the collar but feral and relentless when it is taken off. Bart treats the younger man like an animal keeping him caged and occasionally throwing him scraps of food. One day one of Barts misdeeds catches up with him and Danny finds himself free. A blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman) befriends him and offers him a place to stay. Together Sam and his 18-year old step-daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon) re-train Danny to be a human being. They teach him about esoteric things like art and music and mundane things like shopping and cooking. In the process Danny and Victoria develop the beginnings of an understated romance. Although no great beauty she is exuberant and he finds that quality intoxicating. But Dannys past is lurking in the streets of Glasgow ready to reclaim him when the opportunity arises. Dramatically Lis performance has fewer notes than the simple piano compositions he plays but he delivers whats expected from him in a series of bone-crunching gravity-defying fights that appear to have been done without wires or other special effects. These are harsh stunts not of semi-comedic school favored by Jackie Chan and will appeal to those who like their action served straight. The choreographer is Yuen Woo Ping who seems to have been involved in every martial arts film made in the last decade. (Actually his credits stretch back to the 1970s.) Credibility comes via Bob Hoskins who spits venom and chews the scenery with gusto and a serene Morgan Freeman. These two are good enough that there are times when their performances bridge the credibility gap created by the script. Add in Lis agile battle skills and moments are created when suspension of disbelief is an attainable concept. Unfortunately Unleasheds unevenness becomes its undoing. The film contains enough quiet reflective moments for us to become aware how preposterous the central conceit is and that keeps us at arms length. For a movie that strives to be in-your-face thats too far away.

"Unleashed Reins In the Action washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Unleashed Reins In the Action Danny (Jet Li) is raised like a fighting dog until he gets in touch with his human side in the action drama film ""Unleashed."" (Rogue Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Richard Harrington Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 13 2005 ""GET EM."" Thats the simple command Uncle Bart (Bob Hoskins) gives when he unleashes Danny (Jet Li) at the beginning of ""Unleashed."" Dannys the human pit bull Bart has raised since he was a pup conditioned to attack on command violently and without mercy. This proves extremely useful in Barts line of work -- hes a ruthless heartless loan shark on the mean streets of Glasgow -- but its literally a dogs life for Danny. He sleeps in a cage eats out of tins and wears a thick iron collar around his neck. When its removed and hes cued up Danny explodes transitioning from docile to dynamite in a heartbeat. The extended opening sequence involves several close encounters of the hurting kind with multiple fractures head butts and other major mayhem. Danny is one bad dog. Bart is something of a bulldog himself though he maintains his power mostly through Danny who may be the most effective collection agent in history before Bart discovers he may be even more valuable as a gladiator in the underground world of to-the-death matches where his first encounter recalls Brad Pitts hilariously brief opening encounter as Achilles in ""Troy."" But what starts as a martial arts actioner mixed with the British neo-gangster genre turns to more conventional drama after Danny has an accidental encounter with kindly old blind American piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman as if it could be anyone else). Sam in Glasgow while stepdaughter Victoria (Kerry Condon) studies at a conservatory doesnt see the dog but senses the man in Danny and retunes him with kindness and a fledgling keyboard connection. When Danny becomes a stray after Bart and his boys are attacked by a rival gang Sam and Victoria take him in and begin to humanize him through the redemptive power of food music and love. Eventually of course Dannys diametrically opposed father figures will compete for his soul and the newly minted pacifist will be forced to fight in order to save himself and those he belatedly loves. Directed by Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"") ""Unleashed"" was written and produced by Luc Besson who has explored transformations of violent characters in ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Professional."" Besson previously worked with Li on the violent ""Kiss of the Dragon"" but they are after something different here. For one the world martial arts champ is continuing to stretch as an actor though wisely avoiding the comedic route of Jackie Chan. Decidedly noble in last years epic ""Hero"" Li is here required to be vulnerable fragile sweetly innocent and childlike a short-fused lethal weapon reshaped into a thoughtful human being. For the first time in his 30-film career Li took acting lessons and although his English remains problematic hes not required to talk as a dog and only minimally as a human. There is a nice role reversal though Hes usually the one saving people but this time around its Li who is saved by people. This may pose a challenge to Li fans since there are long stretches of nonviolent drama and curious juxtapositions of tough and tender scenes some seeming to last too long others not long enough. The fight sequences choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping (""The Matrix"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") are spectacularly intense scored by the aptly named Massive Attack. As for Dannys dual mentors the bulldoggish Hoskins could play pugnacious loquacious Bart in his sleep (reference ""The Long Good Friday"") much as Freeman could play the wise and soulful Sam in his sleep. These veterans do most of the talking in a film that could use a little less conversation a lot more action please. UNLEASHED (R 103 minutes) -- Contains strong violent content language and some sexuality and nudity. Area theaters.

"Unleashed Audiences Will Sit but Will They Stay? washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Unleashed Audiences Will Sit but Will They Stay? Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 13 2005 The great Chinese martial arts star Jet Li has had a hard time finding a niche here in the West. Hes as fast as light and hits harder than a tank and hes got spin-kicking punch-throwing dazzlers no one ever dreamed of before. But when he stands still talks or presents himself to a camera his charisma evaporates and we are left with an unprepossessing little fellow with the personality of a plastic fork. In the fabulously interesting if not quite successful ""Unleashed"" he at last finds a persona that works for him. The film is engineered brilliantly as a star vehicle meant to give Li not merely stature but humanity as well to let him register in a recognizable way while still finding the space to show off his Wu Shu stylistics. Why he approaches adorability Its great marketing for the Jetster; too bad the movie isnt actually good in the same bargain. The author of this marketing miracle is the shrewd Frenchman Luc Besson who wrote and produced (an acolyte Louis Leterrier directed presumably in the masters style). Besson as he showed in ""La Femme Nikita"" and the cult classic ""The Professional"" and even slightly in his goofy Joan of Arc movie ""The Messenger"" has a fondness for the feral child theme. He likes to imagine the dramatic possibilities in a wild-raised child whose natural aggressive tendencies have been unchecked by socialization and who has grown therefore into an unselfconscious apostle of violence. Then Besson adds a wrinkle that person is discovered by a corrupt person or entity who recognizing the value of violence uncontaminated by morality puts the person to corrupt usage. The drama ensues when somehow the violent one meets a pure personality is rescued from mindless savagery joins the human community and now must fight those who corrupted him usually to protect his saviors. That more or less is the plot to both ""Nikita"" and ""Professional""; that more is exactly the plot of ""Unleashed."" Thus we discover Danny the human dog (Li). He lives in a cage. He wears a collar that at his primitive state of mental development he takes as restraint; when it is removed he unleashes extreme violence where directed. Then collar restored by the master he returns to passivity to his cage his one childs book his teddy bear and sustenance from cans of cold spaghetti. Terrific idea no? Really quite bright quite original full of rapturous pulp potential. But you will be disappointed as I was to learn that the setting is low-rent London gangsterdom a scuffling world of scams and drugs and debt collection. Dannys master is Bart played by Bob Hoskins in much the same performance as the one he delivered in ""The Long Good Friday"" 25 years ago. Lacking ambition and imagination he pretty much uses Danny as a kind of debt enforcer those great martial arts skills spent pounding 50 quid out of this or that posse of lowlifes. The movie gets interesting when a rival gangster mob seemingly ambushes and murders Bart and the boys; Danny with his zero life skills is suddenly exiled to the streets of London. He somehow (it takes place off camera) finds the one human who has been nice to him. This is blind piano tuner -- yes I hate blind piano tuner movies too -- Sam played by Morgan Freeman who lives with his ward Victoria (Irish actress Kerry Condon) in a 7.5 million restored townhouse in Mayfair (movie idea of rents) while Victoria studies the piano. It turns out that Danny responds to piano music and they respond to him responding to it and so a family idealized sentimentalized ridiculous but somehow idiotically moving is born. Danny gently and lovingly is nursed to health and wholeness he is socialized he is reentered in humanity. Examine please the genius here Li is not yet really fluent in English and lacks an expressive voice in any case so he is initially presented as a near mute with a passive face a persona easy for him to capture. Then in the bosom of civilization he gets to do a cute and lovable childlike turn as the waking waif and it turns out he has a superb sense of comic timing not evident before. His little discoveries are heartwarming his burgeoning but chaste love for Victoria awe-inspiring and the whole movie for a while comes to feel like superior Disney product circa 1964. And of course you know where its going. The gangsters return to Dannys life only now they bring their fury to the wondrous deliverers Sam and Victoria. Danny must fight not because hes a dog but because hes a man. Instead of being unleashed he is motivated. Instead of instinct he is propelled by will. And so now -- again the calculation is meticulously blueprinted -- his Wu Shu skills are not mere spectacle they are righteous expressions of love and loyalty. The movie would work better with fewer elements; the gangsters who ambush Bart for example are forgotten as is a decadent fight promoter. A subplot of Dannys recovering memories and the solution to the mystery of his origins isnt exactly stunning. But the real flaw in the film is Hoskins not because hes a bad actor -- hes a brilliant actor -- but because he carries such warm and shaggy baggage from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and other such wonders that he lacks the fury to be the sole villain. Its Bob Hoskins You cant hate him the way the movie requires you to. Michael Caine now he can order his eyeballs into deadness and be a truly terrifying cockney villain; Ian McShane will curl your toes with his capacity for suggesting evil. Hoskins is too cuddly. Still Jet Li shows that not only can he kick he can act a little too. At last. Unleashed (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for bloody violence and some scenes of rape.

What we get in the action scenes is more like My Dog Thor. Have a nice trip see you next fall Jet Li fells an opponent in Unleashed. Rogue Pictures One of the stranger martial arts outings in a while -- Mozart even figures in the plot -- this frequent bone-crusher casts Li as the ""pet"" of a loan shark played by Bob Hoskins (spinning off it appears his star-making thug role in 1980s The Long Good Friday). Hoskins is inarguably equipped with the right enforcer. When someone wont pay up he removes the collar from Li who then attacks the deadbeat with zeal. (Related video Watch the Unleashed trailer) Theres also a significant back story that scripter Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita The Fifth Element) doesnt divulge until late in the movie. Suffice it to say that Lis fuzzily recalled childhood has given him a domesticated dimension -- and that as long as his collar remains on hes friendly enough to lick your face. About the movie Unleashed   1/2 (out of four) Stars Jet Li Morgan Freeman Bob Hoskins Kerry Condon Director Louis Leterrier Distributor Rogue Pictures Running time 1 hour 43 minutes Rated R for strong violent content language and some sexuality/nudity Opens Friday nationwide His Lassie side gets its chance to be indulged when Hoskins suffers a temporary coma after a car accident. (In fact just about every time Bob gets into a car here contusions ensue.) Taking in this confused lad who looks about 40 is a blind piano tuner (Morgan Freeman) who is in Glasgow with a teen prodigy (Kerry Condon) studying classical music. All sunny disposition with braces on her teeth she teaches Li to kiss in chaste puppy-love fashion and eat ice cream. Thus the movie becomes a battle for the soul of a split personality even if the audience for this picture has to be clamoring for 31 flavors of smashed cartilage. Which is what we often get. The staging and editing of several fights are tops even by the standards of Yuen Wo-Ping (the Matrix and Kill Bill pics Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) especially when Hoskins tries to earn some extra cash by pitting Li against goons in a scummy indoor arena that probably offers cockfights for the bargain matinee. Because he doesnt have to speak much English Li gives one of his better performances and hes supported by two great character actors. So acting and action are pluses here -- as is a certain curiosity factor in watching two diverse halves of a story trying to fit. Ultimately the movie doesnt make it but theres enough going on to make it more arf than barf.

(Rogue Pictures) less In this photo provided by Rogue Pictures Jet Li stars as Danny a slave who has lived his whole life without any sort of normal human education with only one lesson learned how to fight in ""Unleashed."" ... more Jet Li takes a bold leap 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Unleashed Action drama. Starring Jet Li Bob Hoskins Morgan Freeman and Kerry Condon. Directed by Louis Leterrier. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Something bizarre and unexpected happens in the middle of ""Unleashed"" the latest Jet Li martial arts movie For a full 45 minutes nobody gets punched in the face. Instead a kindly blind piano tuner played by Morgan Freeman teaches Lis character Danny how to pick out fruit at the supermarket wear a bow tie and eat food with utensils. Its as if you took a bathroom break during ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" and accidentally stumbled back into a theater showing ""My Fair Lady."" Such is the bold genius of Luc Besson the French writer/producer of ""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Professional"" and a dozen other foreign-made action films. Like a parent who slips a few slices of banana in a chocolate milkshake to provide nourishment Besson strives for something more than junk food entertainment. ""Unleashed"" is the kind of martial arts movie we would see if Tom Hanks could execute a flying spin kick. The movie earns its R rating in the first half dozen scenes where London loan shark Bart (Bob Hoskins) repeatedly uses Danny (Jet Li) like a human rottweiler. A seemingly simpleminded man-child Danny lives underneath a grate on the floor slumps obediently when Bart is conducting business -- and when his collar is removed kills everyone in the room. ""The Matrix"" fight choreographer Woo-ping Yuen is a good choice to showcase the kinetic talents of Li whose martial arts moves have an added animal savagery in ""Unleashed."" The action is balletic throughout the movie and always in full frame without the confusing jump-cut edits used in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and almost everything Jerry Bruckheimer produces. But just as the plot appears to be heading to another Van Damme-style underground fight-to-the-death tournament Freeman shows up the action stops and Li has the nerve to start acting. Robert Mark Kamen Bessons longtime writing partner and owner of a high- end Sonoma winery is listed as an ""artistic consultant"" for ""Unleashed."" But its clear that the writer of ""The Karate Kid"" had a hand in the script. First giveaway Kamen names a lot of his characters Danny. Second giveaway The movie becomes a bit of a tearjerker. ""Unleashed"" mines the oddball pairing of a misfit and a kindhearted citizen who shows him the ways of the world. Replace Hoskins with a few evil government scientists and youd be watching ""Starman."" The unusual tone is nowhere near as distracting as it sounds. Language barriers have always been Lis biggest problem and with a role giving him just a few lines of dialogue he proves hes really not that bad an actor (hes certainly no worse than Jodie Foster in ""Nell""). Some audience members may even walk out of ""Unleashed"" willing to see a movie where Li doesnt kick people in the head. Writer and producer Besson creates action films like Oakland As general manager Billy Beane puts together baseball teams -- making lean lower- budget productions that still perform well. Like the way he did with ""The Professional"" and ""The Transporter"" Besson avoids cliches such as montages and one-dimensional villains in ""Unleashed"" while reserving a few moments for nice details -- including a supporting characters trip to get her braces off. The solid soundtrack helps to keep the mood shifts from seeming too abrupt with the RZA providing music for most of the fight scenes and Massive Attack filling in during the quieter moments. As violence returns toward the end of the movie ""Unleashed"" runs into a few problems. While its easy to suspend disbelief when the movie is all about action some of the plot turns are difficult to digest when the movie morphs into drama. After Freemans been teaching you how to make his moms potato leek soup its hard to get back in the mood for gladiatorial combat with a bunch of cartoon extras better suited for the next ""Road Warrior"" movie. But even if the movie loses its sense of reality it never loses its focus. And when Danny takes off his collar for the last time Bessons plan becomes clear You may have paid for an hour and a half of escapist entertainment but he just provided something much better. -- Advisory This film contains brutal violence nudity sex and profanity.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Unleashed"" is a tender kung fu movie launching at 110 mph before slowing down to a sweet baby crawl. Each of those contradictions is beautifully calibrated creating a weirdly wonderful martial-arts classic that is punch-drunk on childhood. Before you see it youll never believe that a bunch of chop-socky veterans could produce a moving film whose retreats into domestic comfort are as soulful as their gangster fights are exhilarating. The preview audience wasnt expecting to cheer Jet Li wielding a poleax and then sniffle at the strains of Mozarts Sonata No. 11 floating through a nursery. Writer Luc Besson and director Louis Leterrier shock us with an 88-key range from sadistic forte to artistic pianissimo. ""Unleashed"" is one of those rare gems a date movie with exploding squibs. ""Unleashed"" replays many myths in its fairy-tale atmosphere but Frankenstein comes most often to mind. Cruel Uncle Bart (Bob Hoskins) has crafted a monster a mute toy named Danny (Jet Li) who is as docile as a dog until his collar is unhooked. Then Dannys nickname might as well be Acela - a bullet train with no brakes. He shreds anyone in his path which makes Uncle Barts job as a loan shark a lot easier. Danny is unleashed for the first time about three seconds into the film and he illuminates a drab warehouse with a blinding flash of kicks rabbit punches and flips. Lis effective demeanor as the dopey dog makes his explosive rage all the more impressive. Soon some even tougher criminals want Danny to star in the kind of super-secret death-cage betting matches that plague the underworld but which I never get invited to. Hoskins is a sexy beast indeed as Dannys evil foil. He spews venom at his victims but treats Danny with affection that would almost befit a dog if Danny were actually a mutt. In many moments Hoskins is ready to play the kind uncle but then instead of asking you to pull his finger hell rip your whole arm from its socket. Circumstance as appropriate as it is shocking gives Danny a chance to escape. Just as an abused and newly freed dog would he follows the first master with a kind word who happens to be Morgan Freeman. They dont come much kinder than Freemans character a piano tuner. Danny hears those hammered strings in his memory without knowing why. They go home to Freemans safe book-lined apartment all aged wood and tea cozies. He has a daughter (Kerry Condon) who takes to Danny as a reclamation project. The home scenes would be cloying if the director tried to get too much from Li - dialogue is not his strength. But hes a wizard with facial expressions and we see the stunted boy in him cling to the homes warm corners like a holy shrine. Some viewers may feel heartburn coming on at the simple emotions of the man-child but if you at all buy the fairy tale it works. These wildly disparate worlds super nice and ultra deadly must eventually clash.

Besson and Leterrier stretch out this anticipation just enough filming Dannys boyhood flashbacks with an appealing sepia tone and gentle strains of lush piano music.

Says the boss ""I thought it was the Jesuits who said that."" Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at 303-820-1686 or mboothdenverpost.com.

Bob Hoskins is Bart a Glasgow gangster with fireballs for eyes and in the opening moments he snarls ""Get em"" at Jet Lis Danny his brainwashed strong-arm. According to the hilarious risky chutzpah of the movies bonkers conceit Danny is a sleeping Doberman. Just take off his dog collar and he leaps into action here first against a warehouse full of henchmen tommy-gunning them with his fists head-butting incoming punches and tossing furniture across the room with not much more than a shake of his hips. Furiously choreographed by the go-to guy for this sort of thing Yuen Wo Ping this lightning-round opening salvo amazes in a way few movie mortal combats manage anymore. And its just the first of three or four gangbusters action sequences all of which are unexpectedly stomach-clenching. When the collar is on Danny is just a forlorn little pup staring askance out the backseat window while his master barks at him. (If Li logged any research time hanging out at kennels its paid off. In non-attack mode he lends the movie true heart.) One day after a stunning car ambush Danny roams off Barts chain and ends up getting nursed toward normal mental health (he eats ice cream he obsesses over his long-lost mother he embraces pacifism) by Morgan Freemans blind piano tuner and Kerry Condons loopy teen. The goopy awww factor here gets awfully high especially for a violent martial-arts movie but the only real problem with these scenes -- written by The Professionals Luc Besson who also produced -- is that they keep Hoskins off screen for a bit too long. His Bart is the king pit bull of the block and he tears into the role as if it were a lamb chop. Hes one of the best villains to saunter along since Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast.

Opening Stateside April 18 under the title ""Unleashed"" pic was days strongest opener on its Feb. 2 bow in Gaul. Auds craving for a mix of full-bore Droog-style ultraviolence and shameless sentimentality made palatable by name thesps will find what they want in Jet Li showcase ""Danny the Dog."" Tracing the return to civilization of an Asian man whom a loan shark has trained as his personal attack dog Glasgow-set tales assortment of nationalities races and accents hangs together surprisingly well. Something-for-everyone approach should bolster the Franco-British productions international career as far as producer Luc Bessons sales apparatus can carry it. Opening Stateside April 18 under the title ""Unleashed"" pic was days strongest opener on its Feb. 2 bow in Gaul. When no-nonsense thug Bart (Bob Hoskins) has trouble collecting a debt he removes the metal collar around the neck of Danny (Li) who obligingly beats the debtor and any stray henchmen to within an inch of their lives. Bursting with agility and power Dannys moves -- choreographed with zap-pow zing by Yuen Wo-ping -- are a blast to watch. Bart treats Danny like a dangerous pet keeping him locked in an underground cage and clad in rags when hes not using him in deadly human cockfights. However Danny escapes and is taken in by blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his 18-year-old stepdaughter Victoria (Irish newcomer Kerry Condon with a spot-on Yank accent). Sam is so generous nurturing good-humored and honest that only a thesp of Freemans gifts could possibly render him as something more than an inventory of movie cliches. The ultra-patient Sam -- whos relocated from New York so Victoria can study piano at a music conservatory in Glasgow -- teaches Danny how to eat with utensils and shop for ripe melons. Sweet energetic Victoria introduces him to ice cream and gives him his first kiss. Despite having been raised from boyhood to pound enemies heads Danny like many a savage beast before him is soothed by the power of music. However just when hes become Sams partner in the piano-tuning biz his past catches up with him. Scripter Bessons stamp is evident in the pics flagrant blend of pop psychology fairy-tale armature and wanton violence with a Won Ton vibe. But as one unbelievable incident follows another soph helmer Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"") delivers the snappy visuals needed to sock across the patently ridiculous premise. Slick transitions and punchy pace leave just enough time for Hopkins and Freeman to make dopey dialogue sound far smarter than it is. And as both pit bull and puppy dog Jet Li convinces. Score by Massive Attack is effective for an action pic with a soft underbelly. Public domain maestro Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also plays a crucial role in the movies proudly melodramatic denouement.
