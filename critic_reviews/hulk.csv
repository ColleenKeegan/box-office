"Review Hulk an action-packed pleasure - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Hulk an action-packed pleasureStory Highlights ""Incredible Hulk"" truer to source material than 2003s ""Hulk"" New movie stars Edward Norton as scientist Bruce Banner Movie is vigorous and sharp says reviewer Tom Charity Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Imagine Jason Bourne in stretchy pants. Thats the basic idea in Marvels relaunch for Stan Lees Jekyll-and-Hyde character ""The Incredible Hulk."" You dont want to get Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) mad in ""The Incredible Hulk."" Five years ago Ang Lee produced a thoughtful but self-conscious -- and only half-successful -- version of the comic book tale which starred Eric Bana Jennifer Connelly and Nick Nolte. Reviews were good and bad. Business was just OK. So bring on the Hulk again. Its got a new cast and rather new story with only Stan Lee and original TV Hulk Lou Ferrigno back in witty cameos. Edward Norton takes over as scientist Bruce Banner a choice that plays up the Jekyll and Hyde theme and which capitalizes on the actors track record as dual personalities in films such as ""Primal Fear"" and ""Fight Club."" (Norton reportedly had a hand in the script too though the prolific Zak Penn has sole credit on screen.) First seen hiding out in Brazil Banner is keeping a low profile after running off following experiments conducted for the U.S. military. He hadnt realized at the time that Gen. Ross (William Hurt) meant to develop a super-soldier an invulnerable fighting machine. Now Ross is desperate to reclaim his prototype and Banner is just as desperate to find an antidote that will rid him of his condition. He may not suffer from amnesia but like Jason Bourne Banner has a scary tendency to turn into a pure killing machine if you push him. And like Bourne he realizes that in order to disable that reflex hes going to have to return home and see what really makes him tick. His biggest ally is his former scientific colleague Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who holds the original testing data. Then theres the mysterious ""Dr. Blue"" with whom hes been comparing notes over the Internet. Watch Tyler Hurt and Tim Roth go over the film >> But he also risks bumping into his potential nemesis. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is a gung-ho commando a Russian who was raised in Britain and whose main goal in life would seem to be to find a fight worthy of his mettle. iReport.com Will you see the new Hulk? ""Is that all youve got?"" he leers after the Hulk has battered him with the hull of a crashed helicopter and theres a clear masochistic edge to his provocation. Blonsky persuades Gen. Ross to let him try some of that Gamma poison that produced the Hulk and each time the two of them square off the match gets tougher and the stakes get higher. Its all pretty straightforward and theres nothing wrong with that. French filmmaker Louis Leterrier (""Transporter 2"") doesnt carry the same intellectual or artistic baggage with him that Ang Lee does but he seems more in touch with the comic books pop mythology. Moreover his jokes are funnier as when Banner mangles his famous catchphrase in the Portuguese hes learned from ""Sesame Streets"" Oscar the Grouch. I cant say I believed the ponytailed Liv Tyler as a cellular biologist or whatever it shes supposed to be but there is palpable tenderness in her scenes with Bruce and his engorged alter ego. This is Fay Wray and King Kong ""Beauty and the Beast"" all over again. I havent seen Ang Lees movie since it came out but I recall finding the computer-generated Hulk too plastic and cartoonish as if hed dropped in from another film entirely. The transformations here are woven into the fabric of the movie with some care -- often theyre shrouded in darkness or fog -- and the Hulk has a very real physical presence. Leterrier and company are still careless about collateral damage however. Of course they cant afford for the violence to be too painful putting off the family-preteen audience (the film is rated PG-13) but the movie would make more emotional sense if Bruce Banner acknowledged the blood on his hands after one of the Hulks rampages -- the U.S. airman who must have been flying that helicopter for instance. The climax is a bit of a yawn -- it boils down to two big apes slugging it out with an entirely predictable outcome -- but most of what precedes it is vigorous and sharp. The teaser ending hints that well be seeing more of the combatants in a year or two. Its an exciting prospect. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is rated PG-13 and runs 114 minutes.

He has trapezius muscles up to his eyeballs which also are green. When he speaks he does so in concise unadorned descriptives on the order of ""Rrrrrgh Hulk Smash"" But the Hulk for all his hugeness and greenness and monster-ness is also a metaphor for our eternal human rage and how we cope with it. When Stan Lee and Jack Kirby first hatched him in 1962 he was talkier and nocturnal -- he reverted back to normal when the sun came up -- but he was still a mild-mannered scientist with Gamma ray poisoning and an especially ugly temper. Though the hows and what-nows of his situation have changed over the years the essential struggle remains to understand and control the rampaging beastie within. Comic book fans may remember or want to forget Ang Lees 2003 origin story Hulk which split time between Bruce Banners Daddy issues and way-out-there visual effects. I rather liked it but I grasp why others didnt. Most movie goers just arent that into repressed memory. By contrast this new twist on Hulk mythology -- not quite a sequel though it picks up more or less where the first left off -- takes a behavioral approach. It cares not a whit for the poor wee Hulks psychiatric troubles. Instead The Incredible Hulk regards Bruces volcanic metamorphoses into a 9-foot pea-green behemoth as just another anger-management problem. We now find the beleaguered Dr. Banner (Edward Norton) in a terraced Brazilian slum where he studies jiu-jitsu breathing techniques intended to keep him calm and Hulk-free. Bruce wears a heart monitor on his wrist; when his pulse starts winging out of control he closes his eyes and sort of Ooms himself back to normal. Bruce is lonely He misses his beloved Betty (Liv Tyler). Bruce is single-minded He continues his search for a cure. Bruce is hunted Hes pursued by Bettys father the intensely mustachioed General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) who aims to replicate his bio-chemistry and create a hulking super-soldier for the U.S. military. Also intrigued by this idea is the abominable Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) a nasty little warmonger who embarks on his own transformation into raging manimal. He is ridiculous. His lines are ridiculous. (""Something big hit us It threw a forklift truck like a softball"") Most of the plot also is ridiculous but the film moves quickly believes devoutly in itself and cranks up the muscle-headed spectacle with just enough comic relief and character development to keep things grounded. And it benefits immensely from Norton who treats the role with a straight face and an utter lack of pretension This is exactly how a physicist would behave if on a bad day he exploded out of his pants. Written by Zak Penn (X-Men The Last Stand) and Norton The Incredible Hulk was directed by Louis Leterrier the action maestro behind those busy and brainless Transporter flicks. It pauses for humor (stretchy-waistband jokes) and romance though theres only so much Dr. Banner can do in that department without triggering a hulk-mutation. The movies effects are mostly earthbound -- crashing competent and riddled with gunfire. In close-up the Hulk is more cartoonish than scary but when hes ripping armed vehicles to shreds? Kewl. A scene or two recalls King Kong; others invoke the wounded innocence of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein. There are cameos and inside jokes from within the Marvel universe including tips of the hat to the old CBS TV series and a final scene that echoes the Avengers-teasing ""easter egg"" hidden at the end of Iron Man. But no need to sit through the credits this time because this green bogeyman isnt one to be coy.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Im about to let you in on a secret Ive not shared with anyone not even my nearest and dearest. If Im going to succumb to that occupational hazard of movie reviewing -- the noddies -- its most likely to occur in the hottest and highest-action sequences. I know this is counterintuitive. After all those are the parts of the movies that are the noisiest and the most visually splashy -- all flash cuts and zip pans encouraging a lot of rapid eye movement. Youd think only someone suffering an advanced case of narcolepsy would be immune to them. Not so as far as Im concerned. Im like some bizarro opera fan who comes for the plot and heads for the bar when the aria commences. My latest struggle with Morpheus (whose embrace I did manage to avoid) occurred at The Incredible Hulk. You know who he is of course. Hes mild-mannered (but extremely fit) Bruce Banner (Edward Norton who bulks up to hulk proportions when he gets angry or excited which is pretty frequently). The guys so touchy hes even afraid to have sex with his girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler) for fear of turning green nasty and enormous. This figure has been lurking around the dimmer reaches of popular culture for decades -- the sad result of the military-industrial complex screwing around with cell-poisoning gamma radiation whatever that may be -- without attaining more than second-level cult status. Hulky was last among us five years ago in a movie that ""disappointed"" his fans and those of director Ang Lee who usually operates at the ""finer things"" level of moviemaking. It apparently made enough money to encourage this sequel and Norton plays him a little more soulfully (I think) than Eric Bana did five years ago though it doesnt much matter to me that Bruce hates the hulky half of his schizoid personality. All monsters from Frankensteins onward share that feeling and use it to enlist our sympathy. Its as routine in these movies as a fireball in the sky. It also doesnt much matter that during this films opening passage which finds Bruce hiding out in a Rio de Janeiro favela sending desperate emails to a scientist who may have the cure for what ails his blood work hope briefly flares that this movie may turn into a genuine oddity a realistically grounded action piece. But for this version directed by Louis Leterrier thats not to be. Bettys dad (William Hurt) is a general more grim than Strangelovian who wants to weaponize the Hulk. He enlists a gung-ho Russian-English commando named Blonsky (Tim Roth) to chase him down but once they all stop running around Rio and retreat to a more generically presented U.S. the idea that I needed a nice little rest began nagging at me. For the truth is that action sequences have become as predictable and stylized as -- well OK your average opera. Helicopters routinely crash and burn the befuddled soldiery stumble about unleashing firepower and mostly get offed for their effort. Heavy equipment military and civilian gets tossed around like Tootsie Toys in a playroom. And Blonsky morphs into a creature known as The Abomination (sic) for purposes of a climactic confrontation with The Hulk that you really dont have to witness since youve seen it in one minor variation or another a dozen times before. That said one has to admit that enormous moviemaking skill goes into the creation of pictures like The Incredible Hulk. The sheer craft directors such as Leterrier lavish on them is awesome to me. I cant imagine how they orchestrate -- or even remember -- all the little pieces of film they require to build their big set pieces. That thought however is nearly always followed by this question Why do they bother?

That film suffered punishing reviews and a devastating 70 percent drop-off in attendance in the second week from which it never recovered. But you cant keep an old green 10-ton Brussels sprout down for long. Its too early to predict if The Incredible Hulk the CGI sequel will sink to that same level of box office infamy but take it from me Youll have the DVD by Labor Day. If you didnt waste your allowance on the Marvel comics created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby 46 years ago or if you were lucky enough to miss the first film adaptation this sequel stages a brief opening-credits prelude in flashbacks showing Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton replacing Eric Bana) working on a top-secret scientific research project for the U.S. military supervised by a demented Army general (William Hurt) who is also the father of Bruces girlfriend Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler replacing Jennifer Connelly). The experiments goes horribly awry in a near-fatal laboratory explosion that leaves Betty without a scratch and Bruce infected with gamma-ray poisoning. Now hes a mild fellow working in a soda-pop bottling factory in Brazil who turns the color of spinach when his blood pressure rises. Then watch out. Make him mad and he rips his clothes off and morphs into an incredible Kilimanjaro of a hunk--er hulk--with veins that look like the Amazon River flowing through thighs the size of California redwoods. No wonder Bruce is in Brazil incognito practicing anger management with a Portuguese guru by working his diaphragm. But the diabolical conservative right-wing general with the locked jawbone and voice of cold steel (Mr. Hurt hamming it up all over the place in a witty impersonation of Dick Cheney) wants Bruce captured so he can surgically remove his data bank replicate it and turn it into a weapon of mass destruction. (Create more powerful Hulk monsters and the U.S. military could conquer the world) Bruce doesnt want to be the Incredible Hulk. He just wants to be the Incredible Ed Norton. But when his eyes turn to neon and his biceps pop his chains like rubber bands wherever he lands makes a hole so deep you can see Beijing. After a drop of his radioactive blood lands in a bottle of carbonated fruit juice imported to the U.S. Bruce flees Brazil wakes up naked in the jungles of Guatemala and wanders barefoot across Mexico to reach the Virginia college campus where Betsy works as a professor of cellular biology. She still loves Bruce but hes afraid of sex because theres no telling what might happen if he got excited in bed. No matter. Liv Tyler has all the passion of mayonnaise. Just when the deja vu drives everyone to check their watches for how much running time is left a villainous rival behemoth is introduced in the human form of a Russian-born guerrilla named Blonsky (Tim Roth) who performs radiation experiments on himself with the aid of an eye-rolling scenery-chewing mad doctor (another corny over-the-top guest cameo by the dreadful Tim Blake Nelson) and turns into something worse than the Hulk. Imagine a T.rex with a head like a boiled peanut. The mayhem that follows is as rampant and recycled as a contemporary comic-book superhero with CGI can get--and twice as boring. Bruces goal stay alive keep running and try not to turn into the Hulk. But war is inevitable; we get two King Kongs in battle instead of one; and the big finale by hack director Louis Leterrier is like Godzilla Meets Reptilicus all staged in front of the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. For anyone who misses the days when monsters were played by real actors instead of computers theres a cameo appearance by Lou Ferrigno--who played the Hulk for years on TV--as both the voice of the Hulk and a security guard. Looking good Lou. Its dismaying to think of all the wonderful performances Edward Norton has given in movies nobody ever saw. This one is high-octane slumming that will keep him in Bentleys for years. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Edward Norton Liv Tyler Louis Leterrier movie On the Town The Incredible Hulk Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2008/marvel-mush,200,hulk6,hulk,observer

By David Denby The Hulk fifteen feet of lime-green power with the temperament of a nasty child.   Credit PABLO LOBATO ""The Incredible Hulk"" picks up the story of Bruce Banner--the guy with anger-management problems--some five years after the end of his tantrummy misadventures in ""Hulk."" As Bruce Edward Norton has taken over for Eric Bana and Louis Leterrier has replaced Ang Lee as director but Bruces situation remains the same--his blood is infected with gamma radiation or something or other making it unwise for his emotions to expand beyond a snit. When seriously provoked Bruce grows exponentially his muscles swelling under the skin his feet bursting through his shoes his forehead widening to the size of Washingtons brow on Mt. Rushmore. He becomes fifteen feet or so of lime-green power with the temperament of a nasty five-year-old boy--he likes to throw things. Embarrassed by his own might Bruce in his normal state has buried himself in a soft-drink bottling plant near Tavares Bastos a teeming favela outside Rio de Janeiro. He works with an anger-control guru who whams him across the face and then tells him to breathe deeply to control his feelings. The most repressed man on earth he leads a forlorn and shadowy life and Edward Norton exercising his talent for melancholy withdrawal and pained self-discipline makes him a touching haunted figure. Bruce is in hiding from General Ross (William Hurt) of the Army who wants to use Bruces genes to manufacture scores of hulking human weapons. The trouble is the way the movie presents Bruce the Generals project never makes much sense when Bruce is miffed he goes on a rampage and attacks anything within range. A multitude of Bruces could I suppose rip out Iranian nuclear installations but they would rip out American military bases too. Bruce enlarged is not controllable--thats why he scares people and himself. Bereft and friendless he cant even have sex; his rapidly beating heart would turn him into a monster. His girlfriend and lab partner back home (Liv Tyler) doesnt know where he is. Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"") doesnt try for poetry as Ang Lee did (with mixed success) but Leterrier is marginally better than Lee at the summer-action-spectacle side of the Hulk story. General Ross gathers a commando team including a vengeful bloke played by Tim Roth (of the crooked smile) and as the team tracks Bruce down in Brazil Leterrier stages a chase with a moving camera through narrow alleys. Its nothing we havent seen done better before (by Paul Greengrass in the recent ""Bourne Ultimatum"" for instance) but its good enough as kinetic entertainment. When Bruce becomes a monster Leterrier and his C.G.I. people perform competently but without much imagination or flair the Hulk roars and thrashes about and tears a military vehicle in half and then flings the fragments at a helicopter or a tank or anything else threatening him. The effects are grand and violent but again familiar. Weve become abysmally jaded we moviegoers. Digital spectacle is both too much and too little and its beginning to put some of us in a funk of disappointment and boredom. When youve seen one half-ton piece of metal flung through the air youve seen them all. And the truth is that in any version the Hulk is a dull beast. Hes just a big angry guy; he has no soul no oddities no vulnerable or tender spots. King Kong and Frankensteins monster are Byron and Keats in comparison with the Hulk as I wrote when Ang Lees version came out. And by now the timidity and even hypocrisy of the entire conception have become depressing. After all for many of us rage while it lasts is exhilarating as well as scary--a wild ride that seems to fuel itself and go faster until it suddenly collapses. Bruce erupts and destroys things--what could be more fun for an overgrown boy? Isnt it a thrill to be that strong? And since hes impacted sexually destroying things is the only release hes going to get. If he were ambivalent about the powers that lie within him--drawn to the excitement but also repelled by it--the tension for the audience might be overwhelming because Bruces mixed emotions would speak to the way were tempted and repelled by anger too. But the movie presents Bruce conventionally as a man who has a strange hateful disease that he cant get rid of. Bruce is merely disgusted by his situation (theres no make-my-day gleam in his eye as he approaches fury) and afterward hes just exhausted and empty. If he could only describe for us the wild pleasure he feels--the allure of the forbidden struggling against morality and sense--then the movie would transcend its comic-book origins and become a kind of tragic fable of id released and regretfully tamed. But Bruce is just a decent sorrowful guy whos been dealt a bad hand and for all Nortons skill we lose interest in him. ""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" is an obscene ridiculous and occasionally very funny movie and if it ever gets to the Middle East it will roil the falafel tables on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide. Im not sure the picture wont panic the Middle West as well. Written by Judd Apatow Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel and directed by Dennis Dugan the auteur of ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" the movie is about a fabulous Israeli counter-terrorism agent (Sandler) who has a bulging crotch and dangerous hands (he karate-chops Palestinian machine guns into carrot sticks). Zohan however has had enough of war and ""the hate."" After an epic contest with his nemesis--an extremist Palestinian warrior known as Phantom (John Turturro)--Zohan fakes his own death leaves the tumultuous Promised Land for the slightly less crazy New World and settles in a mixed Arab and Israeli neighborhood in New York where he works in a Palestinian-owned beauty salon cutting hair. Making the ""smooth and silky"" it turns out is all he has ever wanted to do. He cuts he styles and he sleeps with the stores elderly clientele who line up on the sidewalk outside for their appointments with the Israeli wonder. Forty years ago in ""The Producers"" Zero Mostel slept with rich old ladies in order to raise money for a Broadway show; Zohan labors on behalf of a corner store demonstrating once again that small business is the soul of the American economy. The movie is agitated into being by Sandlers pelvis which constantly undulates like an industrial washing machine. As for Turturros Phantom hes not waiting for martyrdom and the seventy-two virgins; he sleeps with a harem of terrorist groupies while nurturing his own commercial longings for a shoe store in faraway America. Eventually the two men with armies of emigres behind them meet somewhere in the battle zone of lower Manhattan where the real struggle is fought against a boastful Trumpian real-estate developer and victory is measured in frontage rather than in fronts. ""Zohan"" burlesques a host of solemn and bloodstained issues turning warriors into sex hustlers and would-be Rotarians. The movie propels many liquid substances (mousse etc.) into the air; its crude beyond belief and it includes knowing jokes about the way Israelis speak English and make a living in America--jokes that may puzzle anyone west of the Monongahela. When Zohan needs to rush from neighborhood to neighborhood he rides on the top of a Moishes moving van then hops to another moving van--its the Jewish express train. The movie also devotes detailed attention to the curious procedures of Jewish-owned electronics stores which attract customers with allegedly rock-bottom prices while rapidly (but perpetually) ""going out of business."" In the new millennium we seem to be getting a genre of profane sloppily made ethnically knowing but good-hearted movies--pictures with aggressively liberal values proudly displayed beneath crummy jokes. As in the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" epics ""Zohan"" presents America as a multifarious bazaar where gangs of enraged white males who hate everybody are the only people who dont fit in. In commercial comedy mutual acceptance is now the hip mode of humor. Future academics will see ""Zohan"" as un texte obamiste. This moviegoer has no trouble with lowbrow comedy. The problem with ""Zohan"" however is that its like a kid who tells you a silly joke gets a laugh and immediately tells the same joke again. ""Zohan"" invents a few things; then it repeats and repeats. When Sandler plays Ping-Pong with a grenade or kickboxes an opponent with both feet at once the movie teases the feats that audiences know are impossible without digital. But as this kind of joke is staged over and over the media irony wears off. Digital has become so omnipresent in the summer season that even spoofing it seems secondhand. ""Zohan"" would have been funnier if it had stayed closer to realism. In the same way its funny the first few times the elderly ladies come out of their sessions with Zohan their clothes askew and their eyes glazed--as a minor outrage on sexual propriety. Zohan is presented as a saint bringing unexpected miracles into the lives of the broken-down. The hypersexed hairdresser is a satirical take on the old Warren Beatty role in ""Shampoo"" yet Beatty played the stud with a rather graceful chagrin. He was a little guilty about it while Sandler just goes on and on. Does Adam Sandler sleeping with half of New York really think hes Yahwehs gift to women?

Plus Christopher Isherwoods true love. By David Edelstein Published Jun 13 2008 ShareThis (Photo Michael Gibson/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) What can you say about a man who leaps from a helicopter over Manhattan without a parachute in the hope that by increasing his heart rate hell transform into an iridescent lime-green behemoth so he can take on an even bigger behemoth? That he knows hes living in a computer-generated universe in which gravity is a feeble suggestion and nothing is remotely at stake and that when he hits the ground hell be replaced by a special effect. The Incredible Hulk is weightlessas disposable as an Xbox game. Its also fairly entertaining swift playful without pitching into camp and acted with high spirits. Its subtext-freeunlike its lumbering Ang Leedirected predecessor Hulk in which it wasnt enough that Bruce had an anger-management problem He was also a Freudian basket case with a buried trauma something vaguely to do with his dad mom and a butcher knife. (This would be followed by an even more solemn misfire Superman Returns in which Superman seemed to have returned from Gethsemane.) With all its pretensions and no payoff Hulk turned out to be a dreaded Franchise Killer something scarier in Hollywood than mad-cow-tainted beef at a burger joint. BACKSTORY Five years after Hulk tanked Marvel decided to finance a new version starring the famously opinionated Ed Norton. Admitting that Nortons rep scared the bejesus out of me director Louis Leterrier says it was smooth sailing until postproduction when he and Norton lobbied hard for a longer artsier cut than Marvel wanted; soon Nikki Finke was blogging about the Hulk-ing feud. Norton stopped talking to the press but later sent a 257-word explainer to Entertainment Weekly Our healthy process which is and should be a private matter was misrepresented publicly as a dispute seized on by people looking for a good story. The chief fault of The Incredible Hulk is that it aims to be the diametric opposite of Lees and it jettisons what actually worked. Hulk had a slow careful buildup so director Louis Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn play the whole Bruce Bannerbeltedbygamma-rays thing in strobelike fragments over the opening credits. Its like the projectionist left out a reel. Leterrier made the Jason Statham Transporter thrillers which are so hyped up they dont seem to have a present tense. The first half of The Incredible Hulk feels like one of those trailers where you think Are they showing the entire movie? Yes Things dont settle down until Liv Tyler glimpses Edward Norton holding a pizza carton in a doorway and chases him into a downpour. She doesnt care that he wrecked her lab killed a few of her colleagues and put her in traction. She wants to stand by her Hulk. For Bruce Norton is an inspired choice. His aw-shucks number is endearing yet behind it theres a trace of a sneer. Tyler as a renowned scientist doesnt make Jennifer Connellys mistake (in the last film) of looking as if she has ever hovered over a Bunsen burner. She is blissfully unencumbered. She tries to buy Bruce pants with very elastic waistbands. When he mumbles something about having to catch a bus she holds his eyes and twitters At least let me walk you to the stationand shes so adorable you want to hug her with the biggest greenest arms imaginable. For a while Leterrier wisely keeps those big green arms in the shadows but when the Hulk explodes into the light its clear that Bruces anger hasnt made him humongousit has made him digital. (Theres more of a disconnect between Norton and his cyberself than there was between Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.) The military throws everything it can at the special effect before it decides it needs him to battle another special effectTim Roth as the overweening Hulk-hunter turned hulkier hulk and driven insane with power. Like Iron Man this is a movie in which the solution to terrible weapons weve built and over which weve lost control is more and better weapons. The Incredible Hulk comes down to child-men smashing things to demonstrate their potencybut at least the carnage is confined to ones and zeroes. Guido Santi and Tina Mascaras documentary Chris amp; Don tells the story of a gay English blue blood who in the fifties picked up a working-class stud muffin 30 years his junior on a Santa Monica beach and became obsessed with him. Primed as we are by a culture rich in both homophobia and dirty old men we can be forgiven for anticipating a sordid cautionary tale. Its a shocka happy shockwhen Chris amp; Don recounts a love that approaches the transcendental. Chris is Christopher Isherwood famous for Berlin Storieswhich was the basis of Cabaret and inspires in Chris amp; Don an unfortunate tangent about how wrong Isherwood thought Liza Minnelli was for Sally Bowles. Don is Don Bachardy an unsophisticated Californian given to movie-star worshipand most impressed at first by Isherwoods acquaintance with Montgomery Clift. Eyebrows are raised when they move in together. But a fascinating thread emerges in interviews with friends and in excerpts from Isherwoods diaryread via the magic of movies by Michael York who played the authors alter ego in Cabaret. Chriss ideal love would have to be someone outside his class who wouldnt remind him of everything he fled (going as far youll recall as Weimar). And in Don he recognized a fellow artistalbeit one with vastly different gifts. The young man evolved into a marvelous portrait painter with an eye for the detail that turns a likeness into an X-ray. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"In Hulk only the effects are special - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In Hulk only the effects are special Edward Norton plays Dr. Bruce Banner a scientist who morphs into a green monster when his heart rate becomes rapid. (Michael gibson) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 13 2008 The movie studio might call him ""The Incredible Hulk"" but I came to think of him as Jose Canseco with an incredibly swampy tan. When Joses not barreling through computer-enhanced Brazilian favelas and destroying most of Harlem in the finale of this flavorless contraption hes sleeping deep down inside a lean not-as-green Edward Norton. I must say I prefer his steroidal inner self.Norton joins Robert Downey Jr. as the seasons other very good actor time-sharing his part with a crack special-effects department. In ""Iron Man"" Downey appeared to be having a flamboyantly good time. Norton is a drag. This is partly a matter of necessity. Lest he hulk out Nortons character Dr. Bruce Banner must keep his heart rate low. The movie tallies for us Bruces ""days without incident"" (158 when we meet him) and follows him miserably on the run from the government.This is all explained in a nifty wordless opening sequence. The gist of what follows is that General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt in a bad Sam Elliott mustache and a worse mood) is hot to catch Bruce and use his gamma-rich blood to start a race of supersoldiers. So as on the 1970s television series that like the movie was based on a Marvel Comics character Bruce becomes a lonely fugitive.Norton mopes through the part almost as much as Bill Bixby did on TV. Its hard to imagine Norton sitting around thinking ""Ive got to get myself in a film that lets me play a scientist hiding as a drone in a soda factory for some scenes and as a pizza delivery boy for others. Then in the really good moments a big green monster makes them forget all about me."" But thats what happens.Whenever Liv Tyler is around as Betty Ross Bruces lady love and the generals daughter Norton gets to make moony faces. Tim Roth doesnt fare much better. He shows up as Blonsky a British mercenary working for the general and eager for a taste of Bruces power. Needless to say he gets it and them some.The effects crew does a lot of the heavy lifting. Indeed all the stunts and effects look expensively impressive. That big uptown wrecking-ball climax is a rousing if hectically edited spectacle that pits the Hulk against the beast Blonsky becomes. In the comic this creature was called the Abomination. Yet watching these two computer-generated behemoths go at it is a notch above watching a furious round of Mortal Kombat.You may recall that weve been here before - just five years ago in fact. The occasion was ""Hulk"" director Ang Lees frigidly received approach to the same comic book and boy does that movie seem ingenious by comparison. ""Hulk"" was a study in psychological stress that still holds up as a criminally underrated dual character profile. Aside from the halfhearted blockbuster showdowns it was an art-movie with military ambushes.""The Incredible Hulk"" is a commercial rebuke to Lees psycho-melodrama. The trouble with blockbusters now is that theres no room for the risks Lee took however minimal they actually were. This rebooted Hulk has been made with minimal cinematic or psychological value and seems utterly terrified of exploring the Hulks erotic possibilities. Betty and Bruce make out but stop when his heart speeds up which makes you wonder How many days without incident in that department?Of course the movie does bring the green guy back into franchiseable planetary alignment within the Marvel Comics universe. If the coda doesnt promise better sequels in the future then it certainly hints at more synergistic ones.For now theres a certain pleasure to be had in some of the physical blowouts. ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a fearsome playfulness when its giant star is slamming two hunks of car together like cymbals or bashing the Abominations head into the street. But the best thing in the movie is made of human flesh. Its Tim Blake Nelson arriving late as a biology professor. Hes the one scientist in the movie with a scientists enthusiasm for discovery. Tyler by comparison plays her biologist like a woman running an art gallery.Screenwriter Zak Penn knows his Marvel and director Louis Leterrier can certainly keep a fight sequence going forever (he made the two ""Transporter"" movies). But in their determination to make a reliable action movie they forgot to make an interesting one.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movienation.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 14 2008 Save for later Saved Do we really need another Hulk movie? I was one of the few critics who actually liked Ang Lees 2003 ""Hulk"" but it didnt exactly ring the cash registers or clamor for a continuation. ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton isnt a sequel to that film - its more like a rebuke. Lees movie attempted to get inside the psyche of the Hulkster and for a Marvel Comics movie it was surprisingly nuanced.The new film directed by Louis Leterrier the French techno-auteur who gave us the ""Transporter"" movies is more of a smash-and-slash affair. This probably bodes well for the franchise but ill for those of us who think the world would be a better place with at least one less conflicted comic book antihero glutting the megaplexes.The first few minutes of ""The Incredible Hulk"" whiz by with so much back story that the film appeared to be having a nervous breakdown. This speed-reading exercise is for the benefit of those unknowing initiates in the audience who didnt hear about scientist Bruce Banners unfortunate exposure to gamma radiation that renders him when very angry into the Jolly Green Giant on steroids. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Bruce has been living a reclusive life in Brazil trying to find a cure for his condition and hiding out from his nemesis Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt with a bristly white moustache). The general wants to capture Bruce and harness his power for nefarious military purposes. Thunderbolts scientist daughter Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross - this Ross family has a thing for nicknames - is Bruces (sort of) paramour at least whenever they find themselves in the same time zone. But his condition dooms their love or at least its physical expression since he goes green every time he gets too excited. No wonder the Hulk is such a favorite of teenage boys. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Incredible Hulk Teenage boys may also be the reason why yet again a scrawny actor is cast as a comic book superhero. Kids want heroes they can identify with - at least until the gamma rays hit. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was just fine because well Downey is a great actor and most of us would be happy seeing him play anything even a guy encased in crustacoid armor. But Ive never quite gotten my mind around Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man and Edward Norton who can be a remarkable actor with a Downey-like intensity doesnt quite fit the bill either.As if to compound the problem the Hulk has to go up against the Abomination who looks like a cross between Hulk Hogan and Godzilla and is played in his street clothes by Tim Roth another actor who looks as if he doesnt get to the gym that often.Roth is scarily effective - he has a great moment when he claps eyes on the Hulk and says ""This is a whole new level of weird"" - but maybe its time for a little counterrevisionism in the superhero genre. Now that weve demonstrated that comic book icons can look like you and me how about we go back to the Christopher Reeve era when they looked like square-jawed movie stars? Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence some frightening sci-fi images and brief suggestive content.)

"Incredible Hulk (PG-13)  1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Incredible Hulk (PG-13)  1/2 What The Incredible Hulk does best is rescue the character from the realm of failed comic-book adaptations. The Abomination terrorizes the streets of New York City in one of the most popular Super Heroes of all time ""The Incredible Hulk."" Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald Careful not to repeat the past The Incredible Hulk does a lot of things Ang Lees 2003 The Hulk didnt Its lighter and faster-paced its funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the characters popularity. Even the requisite (and often tiresome) business of recounting the heros origin is dispensed with over the opening credits. When the movie proper starts it already feels like youre into the second chapter of the story. Gone is the dreariness and talky angst that weighed down Lees anger-prone Dr. Bruce Banner played by Eric Bana. In his place is a more resourceful and athletic Banner played by Edward Norton who hopscotches over the roofs of a Brazilian favela like Jason Bourne and throws it down when he absolutely must. The Incredible Hulk is closer in spirit and tone to the comic books that spawned it and the action sequences directed with ferocity and a welcome tactility by Louis Laterrier (The Transporter Unleashed) do an excellent job of conveying the monsters fearsome strength and power. Even though hes entirely computer-generated and not always completely convincing you still dont want to be in this guys path when hes on a rampage. If The Incredible Hulk never quite soars it is because the story of Banners romance with Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and the persistence of her military-general father (William Hurt) to keep them apart has been told a few times too many. It feels vaguely old hat despite the introduction of Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) as a hotshot soldier who in hopes of being able to stand toe-to-toe with the Hulk in a fistfight becomes the even more monstrous abomination. What The Incredible Hulk does best is rescue the character from the realm of failed comic-book adaptations and prime the stage for another Hulk picture one that will hopefully venture into a yet-undiscovered story at least as far as movies go. Its a sign of the studios frantic desperation to distinguish this Hulk from its tainted predecessor that the TV ads for the film have already spoiled a cameo by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. But the anticipation that scene instills is a testament to how effective The Incredible Hulk is. Welcome back big guy. Cast Edward Norton Liv Tyler Tim Roth William Hurt Tim Blake Nelson Ty Burrell.

Joe Neumaier Thursday June 12 2008 329 PM If everyone agrees that ""The Incredible Hulk"" is of course better than the 2003 ""Hulk"" - and an infusion of man-on-the-run drama derived from the 70s TV series helps a bit this time - can we then get the Hulk outta here?Because piling onto something this big and needy is really like knocking over Big Bird. The ironic truth is that the barely verbal Hulk is just not a cinematic guy and the new special effects look like a junky video game. His status as a beloved Marvel Comics creation doesnt merit a film made simply any way shape or form. The sad truth is a movie Hulk is less a force of nature and more a pathetic weakling. In todays version the movies weakling role of Dr. Bruce Banner is played by Edward Norton. Introduced hiding out in Brazil hes studying yoga to control his anger while searching for a cure to his gamma ray overdose. When his nemesis Gen. Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) zeroes in Banner changes into the giant green beast and escapes. Making his way through Mexico Banner finally arrives in Virginia to find Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) his ex-girlfriend and the generals daughter. Adding to Banners aggravation a rogue soldier of Ross named Blonsky (Tim Roth) wants to fight the Hulk on an even playing field so he volunteers for his own monster-morphosis and becomes a nasty ogre known as the Abomination. And everyone knows it takes a creature to fight a creature. Its unfair to compare ""Incredible Hulk"" to last months ""Iron Man"" but a Robert Downey Jr. cameo underscores how one is sleek and fresh and the other is lumbering and been-there-smashed-that. This movie pretends that Ang Lees despised 2003 version didnt happen though director Louis Leterrier - who did the ""Transporter"" films - often flashes back to a previous movie that um wasnt actually made; scenes over the opening credits remind us of an origin story we never saw. And while Lees Hulk mostly battled his id and looked gummy that movies Banner Eric Bana captured the male animals tendency toward aggression and the burbling specter of unresolved anger. This years film even with a giant New York-set battle of the goliaths (filmed in Toronto) feels like nothing is at stake. The characters Jekyll-and-Hyde echoes are too obvious and quickly disappear under the rubble from numerous action scenes. Roth and Hurt glower semi-engagingly and while Nortons scrawniness works he seems intellectually disengaged despite his helping to craft Zak Penns script. An actor like Norton known for his smarts surely knew the powers that be would transform his vision of a cursed soul into a thoughtless behemoth. After all superheroes are the rage even tired two-ton ones. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Was this any way to treat a potential franchise? (I know it flopped but I liked it the images had a pristine awesome beauty that for me overrode its deficiencies as a slam-bang superhero movie.)Marvel having taken the Hollywood production of its comic book heroes in their own hands was not about to let one of its perennial faves fall by the wayside and so five years later we have ""The Incredible Hulk"" this time starring Edward Norton as the tormented scientist Bruce Banner and with Louis Leterrier director of both the Transformers movies and ""Unleashed"" at the helm. Since Lee got the origin story out of the way Leterriers version written by Zak Penn picks up the story several years down the road in a Rio favela where the fugitive Banner is hiding out working in a bottling factory desperately trying to find a cure for his accursed condition and trying to keep off the radar of his malevolent Dr. Frankenstein Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) who wants to use his freakish strength as an ultimate military weapon.Despite stories of fractious postproduction fights between Norton and Marvel (he wanted a more psychological character-driven cut; Marvel wanted nonstop thrills and won). ""The Incredible Hulk"" is not the mess the bloggers were eagerly predicting. Its easy-on-the-eyes slickness is apparent in the first shot a stunning helicopter panorama of the mazelike Tavares Bastos favela where Banner with the help of a fitness guru is trying to gain a Zen-like control over his temper lest he turn into the most destructive green giant in the universe. Needless to say he will fail repeatedly there will indeed be blood. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Leterrier has style hes good with action and hes eager to give the audience its moneys worth of bone-crunching battles. Still once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings nothing in this ""Hulk"" sinks in deeply its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. For me theres a problem with The Hulk always has been though it hasnt seemed to bother the tales legions of fans. When the sensitive physically unprepossessing Banner/Norton turns into the gargantuan muscle-bound growling Hulk theres a total disconnect. They dont seem remotely related to each other which makes it hard to have an emotional through-line. The actor is replaced by a special effect and though you may develop feelings for this heroic beast they arent the same feelings you have for Banner. (To put it another way Peter Parker is Spider-Man but Bruce Banner isnt The Hulk--and doesnt want to be.) As good an actor as Norton can be he thrives on ambivalent shady roles where youre not sure if hes to be trusted. But thats not what this role calls for we should be instantly pulling for him not slightly put off by him. Tim Roth is an equally odd choice to play his nemesis the slightly over-the-hill special forces soldier Emil Blonsky famous for his combat skills. Tim Roth? (Theres a moment when hes sauntering alongside Hurts general and the diminutive Roths sashaying hipster gait is as unmilitary as body language can be.) The madly competitive Blonsky brought onboard to capture Banner/Hulk willingly subjects himself to the gamma rays that will transform him into a monster even more powerful than the Big Green One he becomes The Abomination just in time for the movies knock-down-drag-out clash of the titans in the streets of Harlem. Liv Tyler replaces Jennifer Connelly as Banners love interest the generals daughter Dr. Betty Ross. The lovers chemistry is less than sizzling (she makes a more indelible impression in the spare horror film ""The Strangers."") The movies scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Stern.""The Incredible Hulk"" may well fulfill Marvels hopes for another movie franchise--it hits its action marks squarely on the head. But its telling that the audiences emitted its most audible approval in the movies coda--a surprising in-joke I wont spoil even though Universal is giving it away in their TV spots. Lets just say that in the end the mammoth Hulk has to lean on even bigger movie shoulders to preserve and protect its Marvel-ous future.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"The Happening and The Incredible Hulk reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Happening and The Incredible Hulk reviewed. The Happening and The Incredible Hulk reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 13 2008 1203 PM The Happening and The Incredible Hulk Two summer blockbusters reviewed and a reader contest. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about The Happening click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. The Happening The Happening (20th Century Fox) could be the title for every film M. Night Shyamalan has made. His movies are less like stories that you watch unfold than prefabricated experiences that happen to you. Some of them are pleasurable like the wicked head game that was The Sixth Sense; some tedious like the ponderous parlor trick of The Village. But you have to give the man this much due He believes in his fun-house visions as loony (Signs) or laughable (Lady in the Water) as they may be. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Happening opens with a bang-up horror sequence worthy of George Romero or vintage David Cronenberg. One windy morning Central Park is suddenly swept by a wave of suicides. Construction workers leap from rooftops in droves as pretty girls on benches find ways to off themselves with their hair accessories. Within hours the plague of self-annihilation has spread to Philadelphia where high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is grilling his students on the unexplained disappearance of honeybees. Soon its Elliot whos on the endangered species list as he flees the wind-borne toxin (whose not-hard-to-guess origin shall remain unrevealed here) with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and their friends child (Ashlyn Sanchez). Advertisement If Romero or Cronenberg were filming this story they would enjoy earning the R rating that Shyamalan seems to be dutifully working toward with his ever-grosser suicide scenarios A zookeeper politely offers his arms to a pair of lions for chomping A man lies in front of a lawn mower and threshes himself to death The dialogue is so stiff that its hard to tell at what point a character has crossed over into must-kill-self zombiedom (this is particularly true of Deschanel with her passive affect and gigantic Village of the Damnedeyes). The whole solemn concoction is preposterous and not always in a fun way--even at 99 minutes running time the movie provides plenty of opportunities for watch-consultation in the dark. But theres also an efficiently maintained hum of low-level anxiety. The old-school horror tricks (the fake scare followed by a real one the safe haven that isnt) feel more like cribbing than homage but they get the job done. If youre a fan of Shyamalans gimmicky endings this movies twist on the twist may surprise you. But here I shall draw the veil out of respect for those who prefer to let The Happening just happen.  The Incredible Hulk Ang Lees legendary misfire The Hulk (2003) is now just a blur of hazily recalled images I recall a brooding Eric Bana a weird Oedipal back story involving Nick Nolte and some mutant poodles attacking Jennifer Connellys car. Then again The Incredible Hulk (Universal) a new film directed by Louis Leterrier is also a hazy blur and I saw it less than 48 hours ago. The hefty green corpse of Lees movie has barely had time to molder in its grave but Marvel Studios knows a potentially verdant franchise when it sees one and so the Hulk has been resurrected--if not revitalized--in a new film thats neither a remake nor a sequel but a kind of Hulk 2.0. This provenance puts The Incredible Hulk in an odd position expectationswise. Have hopes been lowered by the chronological proximity of the prior Hulk or raised by its generally agreed-upon suckiness? Why remake a crappy movie five years later if its only going to be marginally less crappy? The recent publicity over Ed Nortons rumored clashes with Marvel over the final cut and his official statement to Entertainment Weekly assuring fans that the resulting movie was totally not going to blow have only raised (or lowered) expectations even further. Advertisement So its a shame that the movie decided to split the difference by turning out incredibly colossally... OK. Theres nothing wrong with Leterriers slick fast-paced direction or with Nortons performance as Bruce Banner the tormented scientist who turns into a rampaging green giant when hes angry. (If you dont have enough familiarity with the character to know why the montage under the opening credits confers a hasty degree in gamma-ray pseudoscience.) Tim Roth makes for an adequate villain as Emil Blonsky an elite soldier with a Faustian curiosity about Banners capacity for transformation. (Its the second role Roths done in the past year in which his body miraculously begins aging backward. Is Mr. Orange secretly Merlin the wizard?) Although the new Hulk like his 2003 counterpart is entirely computer-generated the technology has progressed enough that he no longer resembles an action figure carved from lime Jello. After a jaw-dropping opening shot of Rocinha a vast cliff-side slum in Rio de Janeiro Brazil we find Banner living incognito in a hovel there employed at a soda bottling plant and studying anger control with a Brazilian yogi. But its no use; when a U.S. Army team led by Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) bursts in to kidnap him for weapons research Banner morphs into the familiar behemoth in torn trousers. (An ongoing gag about how he shops for those size-shifting pants is one of the few good jokes in this often-somber film.) From there the film is a rhythmic (some might say soporific) flow of ever-louder action set pieces escalating to a smackdown in Harlem N.Y. between the Hulk and his nemesis the vaguely reptilian Abomination. Other observations culled from this two-hour onslaught of stimuli The Hulks transition from an amoral destructive force to a fighter for right happens too suddenly and without sufficient motivation. Liv Tyler who plays Banners biologist girlfriend Betty Ross appears to be made of marzipan--sweet pliant and utterly bland. Tim Blake Nelson the Don Knotts of his generation kills in a small part as a socially awkward scientist eager to help the couple. And Robert Downey Jr. who pops up as Iron Mans Tony Stark in a cross-promotional cameo late in the film is such a diabolical cad he makes the slender diffident Norton look like a choirboy.  Its been nearly a year since the last Slate summer-movie reader contest in which contestants sent in their ideas for menacing action-movie one-liners (""Veni vidi vici sugarplum.""). The Incredible Hulks curious status as a franchise reboot raises an obvious question What blockbuster made in the last five years would you remake now how would you cast it and why? Ill dig through the office storage room for an appropriately unoriginal prize and publish the results late next week.

"The Incredible Hulk More snack than movie meal | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Incredible Hulk More snack than movie meal The Incredible Hulk immediately informs us its been 158 ""days without incident"" for Edward Nortons beastly alter ego a revelation that elicits primal grunts from the savage reviewer.Is Edward Norton a tad envious of his more emotive movie predecessor as Hulk? Hes mean and green but were not sure why.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 13 2008 The Incredible Hulk (out of 4)Starring Edward Norton Tim Roth Liv Tyler William Hurt and Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Louis Leterrier. At major theatres. 114 minutes. 14A The Incredible Hulk immediately informs us its been 158 ""days without incident"" for Edward Nortons beastly alter ego a revelation that elicits primal grunts from the savage reviewer.A day without incident in a superhero movie is a day without bent metal and that cant be good. Is this going to be like Ang Lees 2003 monstrosity Hulk which was all angst and little action?Happily director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) gets back to comic-book basics delivering enough chases and smackdowns with its all-new cast to satisfy many a fanboy despite some humdrum CGI work.Unhappily the lack of character shading suggests Marvel Studios went too far in distancing itself from Lees much-reviled predecessor. Could a better balance between brawn and brains not have been struck?Reports of Nortons attempts to meddle with Zak Penns script ring true given the actors predilection for deep and moody roles. Its also evident that Norton largely failed in his quest to add some intellectual and emotional weight to his green-skinned heavy. This Hulk aint got no bulk.The movie retells the origin story on the fly but its familiar to anyone who ever read the comic saw Lees movie or watched the 1978-82 TV series. Nortons nutty scientist Bruce Banner bombarded himself with gamma rays that unleashed the bilious beast within. Hunted by the U.S. Army in the person of cigar-chomping General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) Banner does what any sensible radioactive fugitive would do he hides in a Brazilian slum and gets a job bottling lime-green soda pop. In-between work shifts Banner keeps busy in his makeshift lab trying to figure out how to separate the Hulks DNA from his own. He maintains a clandestine computer relationship using the devilishly clever screen name ""Mr. Green"" with a distant egghead named Mr. Blue (Tim Blake Nelson) who promises to aid him in his quest. (Blue provides a convenient excuse to relocate the action to North America with Toronto once again masquerading as U.S. locales.)Banner also pines for his lost love a cellular biologist named Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) who looks like shes not really a scientist but just plays one in the movies. Why Banner and Ross ever got together is hard to fathom since theres more chemistry happening on one of their microscope slides than in their coupling. But shes the daughter of Thunderbolt Ross and thats a real passion killer right there.So far so poignant but the main problem is our Hulky heros lack of green cojones. He only emerges from Banners bod when the host gets excited which Banner does everything he can to avoid - and that includes going anywhere past first base on date night.Fortunately the script presents another character who is happy to fill Hulks size-37 shoes. Hes career soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) a zap off the ol Thunderbolt who makes up for his physical shortcomings with outsized ambitions. Blonsky wants to be a super soldier so he volunteers to be jacked full of the same gamma rays that turned Banner into ""a whole new level of weird."" He calls his new beast The Abomination because Hulk Hogan was already taken.You might guess that the ""days without incident"" counter is going back to zero and it will all be set to Craig Armstrongs stentorian score. But instead of grandly naming this picture The Incredible Hulk it should more truthfully have been called The Adequate Hulk.While superior to its cerebral predecessor - give me ""Hulk smash"" any day over ""I Hulk therefore I am"" - the movie is at best a tasty snack rather than a satisfying meal.Urban geographers and funk enthusiasts will delight at the climactic showdown on Torontos Yonge St. which magically places Harlems famed Apollo Theatre just two doors down from dearly departed Sam the Record Mans and right near The Big Slice pizzeria and the Zanzibar Tavern. Has the world suddenly gotten smaller or just a little less real? Sadly its the latter and youll really notice the fakery in the monster department. The characters of both Hulk and the Abomination look like oversized plastic action figures a poor substitute for the good actors they hide Norton and Roth.But at least theyre engaged in some serious ""incidents"" to use the movies poncey euphemism. The Incredible Hulk finally is just like Torontos road maintenance crews if all else fails in getting peoples attention just rip up Yonge St. The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Also by retitling it as ""The Incredible Hulk."" The previous try released only five years ago was directed by Ang Lee and ran afoul of lumpish special effects. This new production starring Edward Norton as Bruce Banner looks a lot better -- sometimes it looks great -- and its a thunderously efficient enterprise with a nice surprise at the very end. (Louis Leterrier directed from a script by Zak Penn.) Once again though the film is defined by the strengths and weaknesses of the source material. While Bruce is working on anger management you may find yourself working on boredom management and matching his rate of success. As the story begins the hero is hiding out in a Brazilian slum. He has a day job in a bottling plant and a local guru whos teaching him how to keep his anger genie bottled up. The cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. and the production designer Kirk M. Petruccelli find sumptuous images in the plants machinery and the squalid sprawl of Bruces hilltop favela. When the bad guys -- i.e. a special forces team headed by William Hurts General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross -- track Bruce down and try to capture him the ensuing chase has an other-worldly quality; never has poverty been more photogenic. (In case youve forgotten the military wants to kill Bruce in order to understand and exploit his power which resulted from a biomedical experiment gone wrong. Never has a back story been laid out more exhaustively -- in comic books on TV and the big screen.) Edward Norton is always an interesting actor and he brings a distinctive presence to the proceedings. Liv Tylers Betty the generals daughter and the love of Bruces life brings older-fashioned movies to mind -- one sodden love scene looks like a hapless theft from ""Waterloo Bridge."" Tim Roth can be a brilliant actor when the occasion allows but on this occasion he does nothing but fevered shtick as Emil Blonsky a ferocious soldier whose own lust for power turns him into a monster called The Abomination. With the exception of Tim Blake Nelson who has a small but enjoyable role as a nutty professor the live actors skills are underused. The films heart such as it is lies in its Green Guy eruptions which are animated and genuinely impressive but more grandiose than grand. The problem is the nature of the beast. The Hulk stomps around punching out adversaries and breaking very big things like Humvees and helicopters with gratifying verve. Thats pretty much all he does though even when he takes on The Abomination in a knock-down dragged-out climax. Hes a one-trick pony of epic proportions. The Happening There appears to be an event happening"" someone says early in ""The Happening."" Its only the first of countless clanking off-kilter lines in M. Night Shyamalans woeful clunker of a paranoid thriller. The event involves ordinary people -- more and more of them as the story grinds on -- doing terrible things to themselves because of some unspecified aberration of nature. According to one theory plants are releasing a neurotoxin that is ""basically flipping the self-preservation switch."" Could be. ""The Happening"" makes you wonder whether Mr. Shyamalans own switch may have been flipped. How else to explain his films befuddling infelicities insistent banalities shambling pace and pervasive ineptitude? This isnt a case of picking on a guy whos already had a big flop the infamous ""Lady in the Water."" I try to see whats on the screen not whats gone before and the movie I saw was truly mysteriously awful. Unless of course it was meant to be a parody of such nature-lashing-out thrillers as ""The Birds."" But parodies are supposed to be funny and the only laughs I heard were bad ones. For the record the cast includes Mark Wahlberg as a high-school science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his almost-estranged wife. They try as good actors do to find truth in their roles. None is there to be found. Quid Pro Quo Quid Pro Quo"" a bizarre but audacious debut feature by Carlos Brooks explores the fetishist subculture of disability wannabes -- able-bodied men and women who want to be disabled. Nick Stahl plays a public radio reporter Isaac who has used a wheelchair since a childhood automobile accident that killed his parents. Vera Farmiga is Fiona a woman who not only yearns to be in a wheelchair but considers herself a paraplegic ""trapped in a walking body."" Mr. Brookss film which was handsomely photographed by Michael McDonough is nothing if not memorable and that isnt meant as a back-handed compliment. Unlike so many first films that play it charming and safe this one plays with darkly erotic notions that can border on the absurd. At one point when Isaac offers a strange revelation of his own Fiona says ""Youre weirding me out"" which is a set-up for a snicker until she adds ""and that isnt easy."" At other moments when silliness shatters the somber mood you may suddenly remember that youre watching an actor pretending to be paralyzed and an actress pretending to pretend she is too. A particularly gifted actress it should be said Id be happy to watch Ms. Farmiga as Ozzies Harriet let alone a woman as far removed from the emotional mainstream as this one. And she does make her character alluring in Fionas tortured way. But some scenes dont work at all -- among them one in which Fionas nervous play-acting is impossibly busy -- and Mr. Brooks fails to resolve some of the themes he has put in play even if his films title is eventually explained or over-explained. I look forward to his next one though. He certainly steers clear of the pedestrian. DVD Tip ENLARGE If you want to be deeply weirded out by a film about a fetishist subculture look into ""Crash"" -- not Paul Haggiss Oscar winner from 2004 but David Cronenbergs controversial (some would say outrageous) cult favorite of the same name made in 1996 about people who get an erotic charge from car crashes. The cast includes Holly Hunter James Spader and Elias Koteas. Find television listings for the original The Incredible Hulk series at LocateTV.

Sources say Green 56 will make his announcement in Brooklyn and then spend much of the day campaigning throughout the city. While a New York Post poll earlier this month showed Green finishing first in the Democratic primary race at 25 percent his three major opponents were seen narrowing the gap with Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer in second place at 19 percent. Greens aides noted that the public advocate has stepped up his already hectic schedule this week speaking at a Sheepshead Bay diner this morning to a multiracial crowd and appearing yesterday at St. Lukes Church in Harlem where he called for racial unity.

Explosive temper? Violence as a first resort? Youve got nothing on the big green freak that goes by the name of Hulk. In The Incredible Hulk - the second studio spectacle featuring the Marvel Comics super-antihero in the last five years - Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner a nice-guy scientist tainted by gamma rays that turn him into an un-jolly green giant whenever his pulse rate goes kablooie. Directed by the nimble French action director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) from a script credited to Zak Penn (but with reported rewrites from the famously hands-on Norton) The Incredible Hulk starts great but finishes in noisy effects-heavy waves of tedium. Dispensing with the origin story in the opening title sequence (Ang Lees 2003 Hulk offered enough backstory and exposition to last a lifetime) the film starts at a gallop in Rio de Janeiro. It is here in a picturesque maze of hillside slums that Banner has gone into hiding on the run from Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a mean mustachioed William Hurt) the nutball U.S. Army general who wants Banners powers for ""biotech force enhancement"" - that is a new generation of super soldiers. So Banner toils incognito at a soda bottling factory and hangs out with his dog in a rundown apartment teaching himself Portuguese. A typed report appears onscreen notifying audiences that its been 158 days ""without incident."" Bruce Banner has been simply that Bruce Banner. Not the green-eyed caricature of a WWF warrior bulging with super-human muscle and rage. Of course he doesnt stay Bruce for long. Gen. Ross has intercepted some e-mail exchanges that lead him and his team of crack commandos to Rio. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) a Russian-born Royal Marines-trained officer is the top guy and he goes tearing after Banner on the streets stairs alleyways and rooftops of the Rio barrio. Finally trapped in the bottle factory where he works Bruce loses his cool . . .. Next thing Blonsky knows hes facing a ferocious gargantuan. The General hadnt prepared him for this. And director Leterrier doesnt quite seem prepared either. All aces with the human-scale fugitive-in-Rio chase sequences the director lets the special effects and motion-capture-rendered CGI get the better of him. This digitally-realized Hulk really doesnt fit into the fabric of the film but worse the rampaging behemoth bears not the slightest resemblance to Norton. Which makes the Beauty and the Beast scenes that come later - between the Hulk and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) the nifty neuroscientist who is Banners flame and Gen. Ross daughter - seem even dopier. And then theres the ""Abomination"" Tim Roths Blonsky on mega-steroids. More Alien than ratty Reservoir Dogs guy the towering antagonist is Godzilla to the Hulks Kong and the films final act is essentially a humongo wrestling match between the two played out on the streets of Harlem. Ripped metal smashed cars cracking exoskeletons and screaming citizens ensue. Norton Roth and Hurt are fine interesting actors and there are fine interesting riffs going on here and there. Tyler with her eyeglasses (shes smart) and lip gloss (shes sexy) is given only slightly more to do than your typical superheros gal. Dont run off before the credits start to roll though The Incredible Hulk ends with a jokey cameo by a certain movie star with his own newfound superhero franchise. Alas The Incredible Hulk is no Iron Man and a brief appearance by a devilishly goateed Tony Stark only serves to remind us of that fact.

Setting aside the ponderous Freudian themes of Ang Lees 2003 ""Hulk"" this installment substitutes momentum for depth and bombastic battle scenes for character development. It lacks the graceful balance of those elements that made ""Iron Man"" the gold standard for superhero films but its a blast for demolition fans. The story begins as the hunt for the Hulk heats up. Bruce Banner is on the run in Brazil attempting to cure his condition with exotic medicinal plants before hes captured by Gen. Thunderbolt Ross who wants to use his blood chemistry to create an army of super-soldiers. Director Louis Leterrier (of the high-velocity ""Transporter"" films) and cinematographer Peter Menzies make superb use of the mountainside shantytown where Banner has gone to ground. The twisting maze of breakneck steps narrow alleys and small rooftops becomes the scene of a breakneck ""Bourne""-worthy pursuit between the fugitive scientist and his would-be captors. The film takes the form of a chase movie as Banner moves north toward his lost love Prof. Betty Ross and a mysterious scientist called Mr. Blue who has been asking for samples of Banners gamma-irradiated blood in the search for an antidote. The route he travels allows for eye-catching Hulk battle sequences on a Virginia college campus and across New York City (why is the big climax never in Dubuque?). The film the second produced with creative control from Marvel Studios continues the ""Iron Man"" practice of casting interesting character actors not movie stars as the principals. Edward Norton one of the few American actors of his generation who can stare into a microscope without inspiring laughter steps easily into the role of Dr. Bruce Banner. In his human form hes given to nervous rabbity glances hoping to locate and outrun danger before he has to fight it. As his longtime antagonist Gen. Ross William Hurt is a portrait in conflicted power a man used to issuing orders yet who cant control his rebellious daughter Betty or use the military might at his command effectively against the Hulk. Tim Roth the sultan of sneers plays Emil Blonsky a formidable commando on Banners trail. Blonsky transforms into the Abomination a bigger stronger scarier Hulk for the final confrontation a battle of the titans that pulverizes half of Manhattan Island. Roths motion-captured performance in monster form gives a sense that the Abomination is truly Blonsky in a radically altered state. The only weak link among the cast is Liv Tyler as Betty who speaks virtually every line in a librarians whisper. THE INCREDIBLE HULK  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence some frightening sci-fi images and brief suggestive content. The all-important question though is how does the Hulk look? Far better than the green Gumby of the Ang Lee film. Leterrier generally keeps his superhero in shadow or long shot or in fast movement so his mammoth muscles and granite skin texture dont look glaringly artificial. Norton who cowrote the film peppered the script with insider references designed to delight hardcore comics fans while holding together a coherent engrossing story that even those who live outside the Marvel Universe can enjoy. This ""Hulk"" may not be a certified smash but it makes a big impact.

Comments The Incredible Hulk Recommended Rated PG-13  112 minutes Theres enough adrenaline pulsating throughout this bang-up Marvel Comics adaptation to erase 2003s Hulk from memory (Ang who?). Edward Norton stars as fugitive scientist Bruce Banner on the lam in Brazil but still hoping to tame his monstrous green alter ego. When a colleague hits on a cure Banner heads back to the States and his loyal girlfriend (Liv Tyler)--and straight into a trap set by her army general dad (William Hurt). Tim Roth more than matches Norton and Hurts intensity as a gung-ho soldier obsessed with his superhuman quarry. Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter Unleashed) injects the action with a megadose of style and Kurt Williamss visual effects wizardry makes the final showdown a thundering battle of muscle-bound titans.

Me like Hulk whole lot. Grrr. Boiled down to its essence thats about the size of it. To put it another way in terms meant more for Dr. Bruce Banner than his alter-ego ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a fast-paced well-acted take on the big green monster and the man inside it. While it doesnt boast the self-reflexive irony of its Marvel Comics summer companion piece ""Iron Man"" it packs a wallop of a punch. The secret weapon Edward Norton as Banner the scientist whose lab accident renders him an anger-management poster child and then some. Just as Robert Downey Jr.s performance elevated ""Iron Man"" Nortons does the same here. Both offbeat choices they bring a depth to the stories beyond whats in the scripts and the films are the better for it. Director Louis Leterrier wisely dispenses with the origin aspects of the story underneath the opening credits so that when the film proper begins Banner can hit the ground running literally. Hes on the lam trying to escape the clutches of Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) who wants to extract the Hulkiness from Banner and turn it into a weapon. (The power-and-image-crazed military nut case never goes out of style.) Banner is holed up in the slums of Rio de Janeiro working on the production line in a soda-bottling plant corresponding by encrypted messages with a scientist known as Mr. Blue (Banner is fittingly Mr. Green) who is trying to help Banner ""cure"" himself of his Hulk problem. In his off hours Banner practices techniques to help him control his anger to prevent any unwanted transformations. Good luck with that. Ross is hot on Banners trail aided by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) a Russian-born British soldier eager for a fight - a disposition that will affect his future greatly. The first half-hour which includes a chase scene over under and through the tightly compressed slums is fantastic thrilling as good or better than the beginning of any superhero movie ever. But Banner cant run forever so he must return to the lab somehow - and to his love Betty (Liv Tyler). Like Mr. Blue she wants to help but anyone who comes near Banner is in danger and not just from his more-ferocious side. Being on the wrong end of Ross pursuit isnt such a safe bet either. Ross and Blonsky will stop at nothing to find Banner and by extension Hulk. If that means turning Blonsky into a bigger badder monster so be it. The Abomination that creature is called and it lives up to the billing. Banner explains to Betty of his malady that ""I dont want to control it I want to get rid of it."" But the Abomination will cause him to rethink that strategy. Where ""Iron Man"" skimped on a climactic battle ""The Incredible Hulk"" goes the opposite route. The final confrontation between the two monsters is a marvel (no pun intended) no less exciting for having been created almost solely on computers. Leterrier brings a fans eye to the film indulging those familiar with the television show with a couple of knowing treats; we catch a glimpse of Bill Bixby on a TV screen - but not as Banner the role he played in the series; instead we see him as Tom Corbett in ""The Courtship of Eddies Father."" Lou Ferrigno who played the Hulk in the show plays a security guard (he provides the voice for Hulk as well). Stan Lee who created the comic on which the show and film were based also has a cameo. (There are no references to Ang Lees 2003 ""Hulk."") But Leterrier saves the best for last in a postscript that promises more to come. Its not an especially well-kept secret but no point in spoiling it just in case. Big loud messy and most of all fun ""The Incredible Hulk"" offers more evidence that when done right the comic-book hero story can indeed be well super.

To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Sequels are so 20th century. So are remakes. What were getting now are do-overs. Two years ago we got a new ""Superman."" Next month we get ""The Dark Knight"" which will be the second in a new series of ""Batman"" movies. Even an old-schooler like Sylvester Stallone got into the spirit earlier this year with a second movie called ""Rambo."" The reason this can be done is the target audience for these movies is so young that a few years in the past feels to them like ancient history. But at least they got this do-over right. ""The Incredible Hulk"" the second adaptation this decade of the Marvel comic-book story is a big improvement over 2003s ""Hulk"" which was directed by Ang Lee. He tried to make a thinking persons action movie but ended up with a film suffering from multiple-personality syndrome part dull and earnest part mindless and violent. ""The Incredible Hulk"" by contrast embraces its identity as a sci-fi-summer-action-blockbuster extravaganza. Along the way it actually comes close to finding the balance that Lee was looking for. The result is not as good as ""Iron Man"" but its an action movie in that style willing to take its time and take advantage of the fact that it has a first-rate actor at its center. As a concession to the existence of the previous ""Hulk"" movie - though every aspect of it from the look and the casting on down has been reconceived - we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) as a man already coping with his hulkness. Like Dr. Jekyll or a someone in 12-step recovery Bruce is just trying to get by one day at a time working in a Brazilian bottling plant by day and taking private classes in anger management and self-discipline. He knows that if he gets angry if his heart rate gets up to 200 he will turn into a tremendous green muscle man and start taking apart everything and everybody. But Bruce is a man on the run. He may want to slip beneath the radar and live with his condition until he can be cured but the U.S. government - in the person of General Ross (William Hurt) - has other ideas. The Army wants to study Bruce and figure out the science behind whats happening to him so as to create other Hulks. They want to weaponize the Hulk technology. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a chase movie in a sense but its not all about running. There are quiet interludes and genuinely poignant moments that dont feel forced or phony but organic to the study. The movie benefits from an unguarded purity of essence that Liv Tyler brings to the role of Betty Bruces ex-girlfriend and true love; and Norton grounds the whole movie in his matter-of-fact understanding of Bruces predicament. He plays him as stoic realistic and full of regrets that he has learned to ignore just to get through the day. A key moment comes early in the movie in which Bruce following a Hulk episode wakes up almost naked in Guatemala. It could have been a joke scene. Its not. It could have been overplayed for sympathy. It isnt. Hes just a man with a problem and we sympathize. Credit must go to Norton (who also co-wrote the screenplay) but also to director Louis Leterrier for his intelligent sense of proportion. Here theres no disconnect between the Hulk and Bruce. They are still the same man and Leterrier keeps reminding us gently of Bruces physical vulnerability through shots such as the one of Nortons white thin back as he lay exhausted. His strain is almost unbearable. Leterriers intelligence and balance extends to the casting. Of course he gets the big roles right - Hurt as the ruthless general Tim Roth as the head of his assault team - but he also does well with the smaller ones Lou Ferrigno (TVs Hulk) as a security guard Paul Soles as a wise old restaurateur and Ty Burrell as Bettys psychiatrist boyfriend. Best of all theres Tim Blake Nelson who brings a blast of energy to his role as a scientist so intellectually engaged so carried away with his ideas that hes borderline crazy - not a mad scientist but one step before that. Meanwhile casually almost incidentally a fairly serious idea slips through. This Hulk technology could set broken bones in minutes. It could regenerate cells. It could reverse spinal injury and maybe cure cancer and yet what would happen if such technology existed? Picture armies of Hulks all killing each other. -- AdvisoryDisturbing Hulk violence and mayhem.

What seemed in theory the least-necessary revival of a bigscreen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ""The Incredible Hulk."" Revisiting the character Ang Lee and James Schamus put under a psychological microscope in 2003 to mixed results Marvel Universal and several of the same producers have repackaged one of their better-known stable stars in a straightforward actioner that delivers the goods with no unnecessary frills or digressions. Happy to give the intended audience what it wants this loud and quick-moving production will shake loose ample coin in all markets. To anyone wondering why the Marvel team would so soon embark on a makeover of the growly green giant after all the angst endured on the previous one the answer is provided by the final scene in which the star of the most recent Marvel B.O. smash unexpectedly turns up to ask ""What if I told you we were getting a team together?"" New film thus marks the first step in the labels plan to begin shuffling its major characters into films together a la some of the comicbooks -- a scheme that seemingly required the rehabilitation of the Hulk from something that came to be regarded as perhaps too rarefied not of a piece with the studios other cinematic stalwarts. Viewed in this utilitarian light the new film gets its job done. Its not especially exciting or surprising lacking the cheek and sheen of ""Iron Man"" and the opulence and star power of the ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" series. But its better than the ""Fantastic Four"" pictures and ""Daredevil"" and manages to shift the title character from a hopelessly conflicted Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to a wannabe good guy. It seems that none of these Marvel-based films can begin with anything other than a medical experiment gone madly awry leaving its subject with a drastically split personality. This one gets it over with pronto after which scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hides out anonymously in a Brazilian favela while desperately trying to decontaminate his blood eliminating the cells that can make him if sufficiently incensed turn into a raging bemuscled 9-foot screamer with disagreeably antisocial habits. Keen to track Bruce down is Army Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (a cigar-chomping William Hurt) who oversaw the experiment. He wants to bend the results to military purposes and sends mad-dog soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) flying down to Rio to snatch the elusive fugitive. Resulting pursuit is a partially parkour-style chase through the pinched passageways and across the roofs of the hillside slums that entertainingly recalls but doesnt nearly match the flair of the opening sequence of ""Casino Royale."" The Hulk makes his first kick-butt appearance in Brazil 23 minutes in but is only partly seen and in shadows at that. Despite the manpower expended to bring him to heel Bruce is able to make his way back to Virginia stopping en route in Mexico to buy a pair of stretchy pants which he rightly predicts will prove useful down the line. In the intervening six months or so g.f. Betty (Liv Tyler) old Thunderbolts daughter has taken up with a new guy but she immediately drops him when her old flame reappears with major issues to deal with. First and foremost her dad wants to extract whatevers inside him to augment the Pentagons arsenal (theres no discussion of whether or not this super-steroid constitutes a chemical weapon). Second Blonsky who admires his adversary as ""a whole new level of weird"" cant wait to attain that level himself. After he volunteers to receive a dose hes able to compete with the Hulk up to a point in an explosive battle on a university campus lawn but hell need more juice to have any hope of besting the green one in a street brawl. Which is exactly what the showdown consists of. Following an interlude in which the Hulk takes Betty to what looks just like King Kongs cave both he and Blonsky enlist the services of an enthusiastic research doctor (Tim Blake Nelson in an amusingly over-the-top turn) to become battle-ready. With Blonsky transformed into a creature fully justified in being called the Abomination they proceed ripped and roaring to lay waste to Harlem; that the finale would seem to be almost entirely a CGI-animated sequence will be noticed but not much minded. Its all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm by helmer Louis Leterrier (the ""Transporter"" films ""Unleashed"") and penned with sporadic wit by Zak Penn. Visuals lean toward the dark and murky but editing by three -- actually six -- hands is fleet and Craig Armstrongs ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pics generally pro but not inspired achievements. Norton gives indications of perhaps wanting to go places with the role that remain off-limits this time around (he no doubt would have been happy teaming with Lee) but hes kept largely on the straight-and-narrow to decent effect. Tyler is no more or less memorable in the femme lead than Jennifer Connelly was in ""Hulk"" while both Roth and Hurt happily underplay by a bit what might have been expected of them in their villainous roles.

In the case of Ang Lees 2003 Hulk those invaluable lessons include Dont dramatize a Marvel comic book about a scowling humongous green man-monster by giving it a convoluted Freudian backstory austere enough to agonize Ingmar Bergman; dont strip your movie of all lightness comedy and low-down kicks; and dont have Nick Nolte looking as disheveled as he did in his famous mug shot show up to chew more scenery than the Hulk does. The Incredible Hulk with a new director and cast rectifies those glitches and the reboot strategy has an added bonus as well. The audience in all likelihood will be so grateful not to see another joyless inert pea green dud that it may not mind that The Incredible Hulk is just a luridly reductive and violent B movie -- one that clears a bar that hadnt been set very high. The film gets all the arduous backstory stuff (lab experiment gone kerflooey etc.) out of the way in the opening credits then catches up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) the molecular-research scientist-turned-unwitting Hulk as he hides out in the layered semi-slums of Brazil doing his best to be his own anger-management counselor. As onscreen titles flash things like ""Days Without Incident 157"" Banner who works incognito on a soft-drink assembly line tries to keep down his pulse rate which ticks into the danger zone of Hulk transformation at around 200. The metaphor couldnt be clearer. With all that gamma matter in his cells hes like a drug addict in recovery trying to keep that nuclear rage from shooting into his system. Stan Lee the Hulks co-creator has said that he came up with the character by crossbreeding Boris Karloffs Frankenstein monster with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The noble-freak poignance of Frankenstein mostly eludes this movie but we certainly feel Banners Jekyll-like torment. Norton looks buff here but his skinny bearded face still narrows into a nerds skewed smile. His Banner hates being the Hulk -- hes scared of that power wants it out of his body. But the Army led by Gen. Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon and to that end chases Banner all over the globe finally confronting him when he pops up on the Culver University campus where he once toiled and now hopes to find the cure for what ails him. Its quite a showdown. The 2003 Hulk in his rubbery resilience was essentially a defensive creature (Lou Ferrigno in the TV series was even less threatening -- the simian version of a 70s hair model) but the new Hulk is offensive in every way with ugly vein-mottled skin and a way of ripping jeeps in half then hurling the hunks of metal at helicopters to create one of those righteous ""Kiss off"" fireballs. Hes a rampaging force -- Godzilla as bodybuilder -- and the director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2) stages the film for maximum destructive excitement. Its a big dumb boys bash and in the first huge action set piece when the Hulk does his smash-and-grab thing and the military holds him back by blasting him with some sort of atomic wind machine you may for a few moments have that long-sought ""Whoa"" sensation the one that takes you back to the thrill of the original comics. A scene like that almost makes up for the flat logy dialogue between Norton and Liv Tyler as Betty Ross his science-geek girlfriend. Or the fact that a comic-book movie that isnt weighed down by too much story isnt the same thing as a comic-book movie with a great story. Of all the famous superheroes the Hulk as film material has a special limitation which is that its hard to empathize deeply with the pain of this unjolly green giant at the same time that were cheering on his orgies of apocalyptic mayhem. There are a couple of amusing actors scattered around The Incredible Hulk Tim Blake Nelson as a jabbery scientist who likes to watch the Hulk transform a little too much and Tim Roth as a military man who turns himself into the Hulks ultimate creature-feature nemesis. On that score though it might not have made a whole lot of difference had a less talented star than Edward Norton been cast in the lead. Theres only so much that an actor can do when hes basically playing the straight man in Hulk vs. Predator.

"Incredible Hulk The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; incredible-hulk-the ) Incredible Hulk The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Possible Spoilers This review reveals some of the cameos in The Incredible Hulk. Those who wish to be surprised by these appearances would do well to stop reading now. For five years Marvel has been trying to figure out what to do with one of the biggest potential franchises of its universe. Ang Lees Hulk proved to be a dud with fans and producing a direct sequel was as unlikely an alternative as altogether forgoing additional Hulk movies. So the decision was made to ""re-imagine"" the character which is a nice way of saying that the 2003 feature would be ignored. The Incredible Hulk is a more traditional superhero movie than its predecessor and should please those who want their not-so-jolly green giant served with helpings of action. This film provides less talk and more smashing. Structurally The Incredible Hulk is a fairly straightforward superhero movie. While it is not an ""origin story"" in the strictest sense it functions as one in the way it must introduce characters establish situations and relationships and open a series. As a result of so much backstory theres not a lot of room for a complex plot. So the principal villain remains half-formed and the storyline as a whole revolves around three confrontations between the Hulk and this nemesis. The film opens with a re-telling of how Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) entered his Jekyll and Hyde state. This allows the 2003 Hulk to be ""erased"" from the record for those who care about such things. As we join the story Banner is in South America on the run from himself and the military trying to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure to what plagues him. A mishap at a factory alerts General Ross (William Hurt) to Banners location. A tactical team led by the amoral Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) goes in to capture Banner. After turning into the Hulk he escapes and heads back to the United States where he is reunited with his former love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Meanwhile the General and Emil plot a ""foolproof"" method of capturing Banner - one that involves injecting Blonsky with a serum that makes him superhuman. The Incredible Hulk takes place in the same ""universe"" as Iron Man (a point that is driven home by a Robert Downey Jr. cameo) but the movies arent on quite the same level. Iron Man was rightfully described as a ""comic book movie that you dont have to be a comic book fan to like."" The same is not true of The Incredible Hulk. This films appeal while not as narrowly focused as Sex and the City is designed primarily with fanboys in mind. Director Louis Leterriers approach lacks the wit and sophistication of Iron Man. While The Incredible Hulk has some emotional resonance its built on a foundation of action. When Lou Ferrigno (providing the main characters voice) shouts ""Hulk Smash"" it encapsulates the attraction. As Banner Edward Norton takes over for Eric Bana but theres little apparent difference in the way the character is interpreted. Banner is still the same tortured soul he was in 2003. Liv Tylers version of Betty Ross is surprisingly awkward and at times unconvincing but maybe that has a lot to do with her dialogue. Its as if George Lucas was brought in to ghost write her lines. At least theres a real sense of affection between Banner and Betty; that goes a long way toward redeeming weaknesses in Tylers performance. As Blonsky Tim Roth is at his badass best even if all he really has to do is sneer a lot. William Hurt is fine if a little bland as Ross. Then theres Downey whos on-screen for about 30 seconds but steals the movie and brings down the house. That says a lot about the popularity of Iron Man and indicates how big Iron Man 2 will be. The Incredible Hulk pays homage in many ways to the popular late-70s/early-80s TV show of the same name. In addition to providing the little-used voice of the Hulk Ferrigno reprises his role from the 2003 movie as a nameless security guard. Bill Bixby gets a little face-time via some archival footage thats inserted in such a way that anyone not looking for it wont be bothered by it. Theres also a brief snippet of the TV shows theme tune a character named ""Jack McGee"" and an iconic shot of Banner walking alone hitchhiking. Plus Stan Lee makes his obligatory cameo. (He and Ferrigno are the only two to appear in both Hulk and The Incredible Hulk.) After a slightly protracted introduction that puts all the pieces in place The Incredible Hulk stays action-oriented for the remainder of its running time pausing occasionally for some exposition or to advance the Banner/Betty relationship. Granted a lot of the action consists of chase scenes with soldiers running after Banner but whenever the Hulk appears things get interesting. The final battle bits of which have been shown in TV commercials and trailers recalls one of those Japanese monster-a-thons where giant creatures collide. And its a lot more kinetic (and shorter) than the climactic conflict in Transformers. The Incredible Hulk builds to this and it doesnt let us down. The special effects used to create the Hulk arent flawless but theyre good enough. The CGI is evident mainly during the final battle when its apparent that a lot of what were seeing was crafted in a computer. The word ""cartoonish"" comes to mind but considering that this is adapted from a comic book thats not an inappropriate descriptor. The work here passes muster and the Hulk is no longer the bright green of the 2003 feature. Letterier has rendered him in a grayish-green. The Incredible Hulk provides Marvel with its second superhero hit of the summer. For comic book fans Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk represent a solid one-two punch. If the former movie was a triple the latter is a solid single and good enough to drive the earlier one home. Now the wait is on for The Dark Knight to see whether D.C. can hold its own. Certainly Marvel has succeeded in wiping away the hangover from last summers crop of superhero movies and revising the future look more promising.
