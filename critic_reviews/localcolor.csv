"Life in complex colors - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsCAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS Life in complex colorsJuly 31 2009|Kevin Thomas; Gary Goldstein Armin Mueller-Stahl achieved international renown in the films of Germanys R.W. Fassbinder and has since become frequent presence in many American films. In his heartfelt autobiographical ""Local Color"" writer-director George Gallo has given the stocky ever-commanding Mueller-Stahl a heroic bravura role and has been rewarded by the actor with a towering complex portrayal that is surely among his finest.The time is 1974 and the place Port Chester N.Y. A Russian emigre with a tragic past Mueller-Stahls Nicolai became an acclaimed landscape painter but his work has gone out of style. He has become a recluse in his turn-of-the-last century house but John (Trevor Morgan) an aspiring teenage painter and an admirer of Nicolais work is determined to connect with the crusty vodka-swilling old man. Against formidable odds John wins Nicolais trust to the extent that Nicolai invites him to spend the summer with him at his sprawling Pennsylvania country estate. Nicolai sees in John a handyman whereas John sees in Nicolai a teacher. Its a volatile struggle for sure but in the seesawing process what the two men learn from each other lies beyond words.Gallo nevertheless has a terrific way with dialogue and much of the humor and wit in the film derives from Nicolai and his friend and neighbor (a hilarious Ron Perlman) engaging in an intellectual battle over the merits of traditional and contemporary art.-- Kevin Thomas""Local Color."" MPAA rating R for language. Running time 1 hour 37 minutes. At selected theaters.--A conscience grows in SilenceCelebrated Belgian writer-directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes ""Lornas Silence"" confirms the brothers status in the top rank of filmmakers in world cinema with their grasp of the workings of the human heart and ability to make visually eloquent films of the utmost economy. ""Lornas Silence"" is a gritty deceptively low-key no-fuss no-frills movie of consistent originality and surprise in which suspense arises straight up from the heroines evolving character.Arta Dobroshis Lorna is a beautiful dark-haired young Albanian working in a dry cleaning shop in the sizable impersonal city of Liege prepared to do anything to secure Belgian citizenship and open a snack bar with her Albanian boyfriend Sokol (Alban Ukaj). To this end she has committed to an elaborate scheme concocted by erstwhile taxi driver Fabio (Fabrizio Rongione) that involves her marriage to heroin addict Claudy (Jeremie Renier) as its first step. It is then to involve an act even more shocking than when Renier cast as the feckless father in the Dardennes ""LEnfant"" (2005) sold his own baby.Lorna appears to be determinedly ruthless but a tiny flicker of conscience surfaces gradually growing and taking the entire film in unexpected directions. So thoroughly do the Kosovo-born Dobroshi and the Dardennes illuminate everything Lorna feels or does no matter how surprising it is persuasive. As Lorna commences her self-discovery the film brings to mind the films of Robert Bresson with their remorseless yet glowing spiritual odysseys. Like Bresson however theres nothing ordinary about the Dardennes or ""Lornas Silience.""-- Kevin Thomas""Lornas Silence."" MPAA rating R for brief sexuality/nudity and language. Running time 1 hour 45 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At selected theaters.--Australian films in wilder daysThe Australian genre flicks of the 1970s and 80s receive a jam-packed documentary tribute in Mark Hartleys ""Not Quite Hollywood The Wild Untold Story of Ozploitation."" Its a kicky slightly exhausting look at a bygone era of low-rent moviemaking whose colorful trove of film clips should delight fans of cinematic esoterica nostalgic schlock and high octane drive-in fare.A bit of history In 1971 relaxed Australian censorship standards ushered in a string of locally produced sex farces with such titles as ""Stork"" ""The Adventures of Barry McKenzie"" and ""Alvin Purple."" These and nudity-filled titillators hit box office gold generated sequels and copycats and eventually gave way to a wave of influential horror and action films (including ""Patrick"" ""The Man From Hong Kong"" and most notably ""Mad Max"") that also pushed the envelope but with gonzo violence and outrageous stunts.A raft of Australian filmmakers actors and critics enjoyably weigh in here on the so-called ""Ozploitation"" phenomenon as do several of the American actors who appeared in these pictures such as Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis (""Roadgames"") Dennis Hopper (""Mad Dog Morgan"") and Steve Railsback (""Turkey Shoot""). But its famed exploitation movie-geek Quentin Tarantino who has the most fun as he vociferously extols the virtues of these lowbrow thrillfests.-- Gary Goldstein1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCheer cheer for old Notre DameFebruary 5 2008Behind the scenesFebruary 9 2003Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-capsules31-2009jul31,0,7071128.story",200,localcolor0,localcolor,latimes

Hedging just about every bet it lays on the table to the tune of a gentle guitar Adam spins a wish-fulfilling romance between a recently bereaved young man with Aspergers syndrome (Hugh Dancy) and his beauteous new neighbor Beth (Byrne) who all too conveniently happens to work in a helping profession. Writer-director Mayer tries to reduce the improbability quotient by loading Beth up with burdens of her own (including Peter Gallagher who does ""feckless father"" in his sleep) which test the authenticity of her values. To his credit Dancy doesnt take the showstopping Rain Man route but however underplayed his Adam is all too authentic for most social intercourse. Clogged to the pore with pathos (boxes of mac and cheese stacked in Adams freezer) bogus romanticism about mental illness (Adam sees natural wonders the rest of us dont) the obligatory kindly black helper (Frankie Faison) and the saintly patience of the love interest Adam only confronts reality at the end when it timidly owns up to the likelihood that such relationships only work if the healthy partner is willing to become a mother not a wife.

Sep. 13 600pm GO THE COVELate in the infectiously frisky documentary The Cove an older man calmly gate-crashes an international conference on whaling with a TV screen strapped to his chest showing bloody images of the mass slaughter of dolphins in a cove off the coast of Japan. Its a show-stopping publicity stunt by dolphin advocate Ric OBarry and also one act of an ongoing ritual of public penance by this one-time hunter and trainer of dolphins for the 1960s television series Flipper. OBarry came to understand that dolphins cutting up on TV or in aquariums around the world may provide oceans of fun for audiences but that its torture for the sociable intelligent mammals forcibly separated from their fellows and habitat. The sleepy-eyed but intense OBarry -- who slips into Japan in silly disguises to avoid being arrested or attacked by irate fisherman at the cove where dolphins are culled for export or killed -- is the perfect star for this forthrightly activist film. But hes far from the only performance artist in the rousing blend of pop entertainment faux-thriller horror movie and naked agitprop that is The Cove a benign feat of manipulation designed to make you rue every minute you spent ooh-ing and aah-ing at SeaWorld. Its also designed to make you call for the blood of the Japanese government which lobbies against international efforts to protect small crustaceans and secretively protects the fishermen who trap thousands of dolphins a year to sell for export or kill for as it turns out mercury-contaminated meat that shows up not only in delicatessens around the world but in the school lunches of Japanese children. ""Youre an activist or an inactivist"" says director Louie Psihoyos co-founder of the Oceanic Preservation Society. He possesses the instincts and righteous rage of Michael Moore but without Moores bile or self-importance. The Cove is the exuberantly theatrical and often funny story of Psihoyos and his team of overgrown authority-averse schoolboys (and one tender girl). This self-described ""Oceans Eleven"" includes a stuntman and a gung-ho team of designers from Industrial Light and Magic who create rocks with hidden cameras to plant around the cove and record the mass murder of these lovely mammals. Lovely is the operative word. Skillful and hugely entertaining as it is Im not sure The Cove would be as potent as it is if the subject were say walruses. Dolphins are the Goldie Hawns of endangered species bright playful cute -- and by some freak of nature they appear to be grinning most of the time. OBarry laments the anthropomorphization that has turned dolphins into clowns in aquariums around the world but hes not above ascribing human motivation to them. When one of the dolphins stops breathing in his arms he calls its death a suicide. The Cove is enchanting horrifying rousing; but it comes close to making the case that dolphins should be saved because theyre cute and breathe air. Where does that leave the overfished salmon I went home to poach? (ArcLight Hollywood; The Landmark) (Ella Taylor)THE ENGLISH SURGEON The English surgeon is Henry Marsh a British neuroscientist who has been traveling to Ukraine since 1992 to tutor diagnose and perform operations that the post-Soviet medical infrastructure is incapable of handling. Geoffrey Smiths well-meaning documentary takes risks Contextual setup aside the films footage comes from a mere two weeks of shooting Marshs umpteenth visit to remove an especially risky tumor. Smith has the guts to show graphic brain surgery and the sense to avoid maudlin testimonies from friends and family knowing that no adoring relative could explain why a world-renown scientist sacrifices his time and mental health to repeatedly do the right thing for no reward. But I wish more attention had been focused on Marshs Ukrainian friend Igor Kurilets struggles with the countrys proudly anachronistic medical establishment -- The Death Of Mr. Lazarescu this aint. By focusing on Marsh without any real personal or structural insight the effect is to prioritize the humanitarian over the far more interesting problem the system. And the end -- a tear-soaked predictably bathetic visit to the family of a girl who died when Marsh made the wrong call on the operating table -- succumbs to the easy sentimentality the film has shirked till then. That a young girls death is lastingly sad is the smallest revelation of all. (Music Hall) (Vadim Rizov) G-FORCEThe premise punched-up puns and character development are more lightweight than the helium balloons in Up but Disneys new CGI-heavy excuse to flood the market with kiddie merch (its the years first 3-D commercial and were the real guinea pigs) has a box-office trick up its shallow sleeve Jerry Bruckheimer. Amping up the Beverly Hills Chihuahua formula with a whole A-team of adorable talking furballs who converse in one-liners and pop culture references (Apocalypse Now and Scarface really?) the mega-producers stamp is on every fight sequence explosion and ugly stereotype. Im referring to Blaster one of the genetically modified guinea pigs in G-Force -- a federally funded team of elite animal operatives -- who is literally black speaks in buffoonish jive and is voiced by Tracy Morgan (""Holla""). Penelope Cruz plays the spicy she-pig Juarez but more embarrassing is Zach Galifianakis apparently still hungover and forced to show his live-action mug as the nerdy Dr. Dolittle who commands the squad with voice-recognition hardware. Together along with a fly a mole and the competent direction of longtime F/X supervisor Hoyt Yeatman Jr. these charmless happy-meal avatars must battle evil industrialist Bill Nighy and his sentient consumer-electronics robot which looks exactly like a junkyard Decepticon. From recycled trash to inevitable blockbuster gold Bruckheimer is the true transformer. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)LOCAL COLOR For a purportedly autobiographical work the events of this labor of love from director George Gallo (whose screenwriting credits include Midnight Run and Bad Boys) fit seamlessly into the fabric of the standard coming-of-age movie. John (Trevor Morgan) a fledgling aesthete from a working-class family whose father (Ray Liotta) equates artistic inclinations with effeminacy seeks out the tutelage of Nikolai (Armin Mueller-Stahl) a foul-mouthed vodka-guzzling painter who has given up on art and life. The year is 1974 and Nikolais career as an old-fashioned paint-and-brushes man has foundered under the rise of abstraction which he constantly rails against dishing up equal servings of profanity and profundity in a thick Russian accent thats supposed to cut through all the bullshit and pretension on display. Over the course of a life-changing summer at Nikolais country house John learns about more than just color theory thanks to the ministrations of an older woman (Samantha Mathis) and it seems inevitable that before the credits roll the kid will also have inspired a new lease on artistic life in the old master. This painlessly tasteful film serves both as propaganda -- simplistically championing the integrity of representational art over sordid modernism -- and as an inspirational tale in which one discovers that in the art world as in Hollywood dreams really can come true. With Ron (Hellboy) Perlman providing comic relief as a grotesque cravat-sporting art dealer. (Music Hall; Fallbrook 7) (John Tottenham)LORNAS SILENCE Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne secular worker-priests of the Belgian cinema emerge once more from their lower depths. In describing one of their movies you describe them all. Their characters are the victims of soggy street-cart food and social disintegration -- no God no family or community infrastructure no moral compass. Here its Lorna (Arta Dobroshi) an Albanian living with a Belgian junkie Claudy (Jeremie Renier). Spouse or roommate? The details casually drop into place. Theyre married only as a business arrangement Claudy got his dope money; Lorna got Belgian citizenship which shes scheduled to transmit through remarriage to another incoming immigrant all arranged by phlegmatic lowlife mobster Fabio (Fabrizio Rongione). This being a Dardenne film the protagonist is stashing money to buy a modest dream of ""normal life"" -- Lorna wants to open a snack shop with her boyfriend. This being a Dardenne film Lornas a self-preserving solipsist blind to any harm she does getting hers which includes having passively agreed to Fabios plan murder-O.D. Claudy to expedite her divorce and next quick-cash wedding. In a sense the Dardennes make economic horror movies starring the dregs of the working class. Claims for something higher dont read; the Dardennes challenge their beleaguered subjects not themselves and not their audience. When Lorna and her ilk confront the ""moral conundrums"" of bare-subsistence life no alternative answer seems viable. This leaves the viewer (impatient in this case) to wait for the constipated soul to arrive at inevitable relief. (Royal; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Nick Pinkerton) GO NOT QUITE HOLLYWOOD At the same moment that directors like Peter Weir and Gillian Armstrong were earning festival kudos and critical acclaim for the early films of the Australian ""new wave"" the more industrious/shameless likes of director Tim Burstall (""Tim liked getting tit in the shot"") and producer Antony I. Ginnane (""the Roger Corman of Australia"") were churning out low-budget quickies equally ripe for world export -- albeit to the grindhouses instead of the art houses. Mark Hartleys boisterous film-buff documentary Not Quite Hollywood pays loving homage to the latter camp who played an equally important role in the 1970s revival of a moribund Aussie film industry even as their movies popularized the notion of the outback as a haven for loose women slobbering boozers and homicidal biker gangs. Mostly alive and well and happy to share their war stories before Hartleys camera these ""Ozploitation"" mavens run the gamut from larger-than-life carnival-barker hucksters (like The ABC of Love and Sex Australia Style impresario John D. Lamond interviewed in front of a pole-hugging go-go dancer) to ingenious genre purveyors (like George ""Mad Max"" Miller and the late Richard Franklin whose Hitchcock-inspired Patrick and Roadgames beg rediscovery). But the talking heads here are routinely upstaged by the exploding ones -- plus lots of jiggling jugs and airborne motorbikes -- provided by Hartleys exuberant film-clip montages. The rise of video and the death of the drive-ins would eventually bring the curtain down on the Aussie schlock industry but for two glorious hours Not Quite Hollywood returns us to a time when the price of admission was cheap and the thrills even cheaper.

Years before scripting Midnight Run and The Whole Ten Yards writer-turned-director George Gallo was first an impressionist landscape painter and his life-changing experiences from the summer of 1974 apparently resembled Ralph Macchios leg-sweeping coming of age in The Karate Kid. Standing in for the young Gallo Trevor Morgan stars as John an impassioned naive teenager who begins pestering a vodka-swilling Russian genius of a brushman named Nicoli (Armin Mueller-Stahl) to teach him the true meaning of Christmas. Curmudgeonly and insultingly curt Nicoli nicknames John ""the little shit"" drops F-bombs to prove to us that hes grouchy and forces his young protege into wallpapering his room and doing other maintenance chores. (Painting the fence would obviously be redundant.) Sappy and overworked the film swells and stays swollen with on-the-nose uplift such as the eureka moment when John learns that clouds arent really just white or when nearby neighbor Carla (Samantha Mathis) gives him his first electrifying kiss. The characters talk stiltedly and broadly about the art of art and theres nothing more artless than that.

Alas even the soft-hearted may find this formulaic yarn of a young mans apprenticeship to a cantankerous artist too rosy-hued and treacly. From the start George Gallos autobiographical feel-good drama ""Local Color"" warns auds that cynics may object to the sentiment about to overwhelm the screen. Alas even the soft-hearted may find this formulaic yarn of a young mans apprenticeship to a cantankerous artist too rosy-hued and treacly. With its by-the-book structure and cliched plot pic wants to flex some cinematic muscle but despite widescreen format remains a strictly small screen affair. Undoubtedly a personally meaningful labor of love painter/scripter/helmer Gallo and past producer/collaborator David Permut raised the 5 million budget mostly through friends and acquaintances shooting in just 25 days. Pic was one of the last films lensed in Louisiana (successfully posing as Pennsylvania) before Katrina took its toll. John (Trevor Morgan ""Mean Creek"") is a starry-eyed high schooler in 1974 Port Chester N.Y. who is convinced hell leave his mark on the world of painting one day. A devoted admirer of reclusive artist Nicholai Seroff (Armin Mueller Stahl) John ignores advice and presents himself at Seroffs screen door. Predictably the old man isnt interested in pupils or even conversations with the fresh-faced kid but -- surprise -- persistence pays off and John displays his knowledge of art theory to a reluctantly impressed Seroff who invites ""the little shit"" to spend the summer at his Pennsylvania home. Johns working class dad (Ray Liotta) is convinced the old guys a pervert and forbids John from going but with starry-eyed determination John sets off anyway. Initially Seroff simply has the young man deal with household chores though eventually he opens Johns eyes to the fundamentals of landscape painting. Of course John also gets his first real kiss that summer from older neighbor Carla (Samantha Mathis) so art and life and love all come together in a golden haze of nostalgia-drenched light. But not content with making this a simple tale of artistic awakening Gallo throws in simplistic swipes at the pretensions of contemporary art critics who dismiss the beauty of representational works. All this heavy-handed debate stops the drama cold. Nonetheless Mueller Stahl avoids the schmaltz and provides a glimpse of a man beyond mere stereotype. Looking like the perfect Fox juvenile Morgan does his best with stilted lines his eyes glistening appropriately in the late summer light. As a modern art dealer Ron Perlman kitted up in queeny ascots is just cartoonish and Diana Scarwid has a thankless role as Johns German-born mother her accent and character equally indefinable. Gallos choice of widescreen was perhaps a result of his desire to glorify landscape art and Michael Negrins lensing takes advantage of the natural beauty.
