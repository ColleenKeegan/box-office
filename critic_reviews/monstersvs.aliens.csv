""Monster vs. Aliens"" encapsulates virtually every stereotype about bad videogame movie adaptations in one package. Derivative repetitive and not so much inspired by the DreamWorks toon as a weak attempt to mimic it the game seems built to appeal only to young kids with short attention spans and minimal skills. After the pics boffo opening some tykes might be drawn to the game as a way to relive the film until the DVD release but players of any age looking for an engaging videogame will be sorely disappointed. The ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" film like most DreamWorks Animated features is full of jokes and allusions meant to appeal to adults. But Activisions game has no such pretensions. Within the first 20 minutes there are two belches and a fart. Theres no remotely challenging gameplay as it cruises easily down the path of the movies events. Players alternate among three styles of playing each associated with one of the monsters. Susan (aka Ginormica a fifty-foot tall woman) dons a pair of cars as roller-skates and hurtles down roads and corridors with minimal wriggling room. The Missing Link a cross between an ape and a fish smashes and bashes his way through robot enemies. And B.O.B. a blob gets saddled with the platforming action which includes a few minor puzzle challenges the occasional turret shooting gallery and some moderately clever gravity-bending levels. Theres nothing here that hasnt been done better in numerous other games. When the ""God of War""-style button-pressing sequences in which players just occasionally press buttons while watching a cutscene borrowed from the film appear its clear the developers have run out of ideas. To its credit ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" moves quickly. Though theres not much variety (its probably not a good idea to have one of the characters regularly comment on how repetitive the game is) and its chopped into short alternating segments that might distract a child from noticing he or she is essentially replaying the same bits but with a slightly different background. Game follows the basic outline of the film with a setpiece on the Golden Gate Bridge for instance but none of the particulars. It seems like the developers at Beenox were given a cast of characters a list of locations that had to be visited in order and little else. Unlike the film the humor here is mostly flat. In a clever idea to extend gameplay each character has a ""directors commentary"" -- a set of alternate jokes the player will only hear when replaying a level. There are plenty of unlockables in the ""DNA lab"" which consists of a set of branching paths supposedly resembling a DNA strand (which it absolutely doesnt). Here players are invited to spend their easily earned points unlocking concept art character improvements and levels theyre already played that are repurposed as score-based challenges. The cooperative multiplayer game is based on the system in ""Super Mario Galaxy"" allowing a second player to move a cursor around the screen zapping bad guys. Its a smart way to let very young kids watch and participate without having to learn to play the game proper. Graphics are passable recalling nicely the look and movements of the movie. Most of the movies voice talents are on hand and do solid work including Reese Witherspoon Seth Rogen Will Arnett and Rainn Wilson. Since Hugh Laurie didnt sound so much like Hugh Laurie in the movie the use of a soundalike for his Dr. Cockroach is no great loss.

When a meteorite strikes their wedding ceremony Susan is affected by fallout and grows into a 50-foot chick with attitude. Shes taken to a secret underground facility where she meets her freaky co-stars BOB (a gelatinous blob) Mr Cockroach Missing Link (half-fish half-ape) and a hare-brained maggot called Insectosaurus. Some chucklesome Airplane-style humour is unleashed during this early stage as Susan (renamed Ginormica) tries to come to terms with her size her surroundings and her wacky new friends. But as any filmmaker knows theres only so much jollity kids will endure before they yearn for some evil influence to stir things up and here its in the unoriginal form of an invasion from space. Will Ginormica and friends defeat the evil aliens and more to the point will she ever be able to return to a normal life with Derek?Monsters vs Aliens is skilfully animated and spasmodically funny but you get the impression the films seven () writers ran out of ideas two-thirds of the way through opting for a conventional succession of overwrought combat sequences and feverish hyperbole. The film is screened in both 3D and 2D but aside from a handful of impressive 3D effects youd be equally well-served opting for the two-dimensional version.

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents A giant female teams up with a blob and other beasts in DreamWorks new movie. Credit Illustration by Pablo Lobato To what period does ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" belong? It is set in the present day but its snout is pointed proudly at the future. The skills it employs in its capacity as the latest animated feature from DreamWorks could not be more gleamingly new. Yet something about this movie suggests that it was made by people who have never deep down accepted the fact that America has moved on from the nineteen-fifties--from the days in which Saturday night meant gazing through your windshield at ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman."" In short shes back and this time shes digital. At the beginning she is a female of regular size by the name of Susan. We start on her wedding day in Fresno. (I love the way that not unlike the cosmos the imagination of companies like DreamWorks is infinite yet bounded; they have all Gods creation to juggle with but given the choice they prefer not to leave California.) Susan is marrying Derek--jerk by nature TV weatherman by trade. Shortly before the ceremony the bride is struck by a meteorite which causes her to glow apple-green and swell upward in front of the congregation. ""Youre shrinking"" she cries as she rises. Congratulations to whichever of the five screenwriters came up with that line. Lewis Carroll would be proud of you. No sooner has Susans head burst through the church roof than she is captured by the Army and removed to a secure facility where to her dismay she is stored as a potential weapon of war--a ""rare female monster"" according to the general in charge of the program who may be too young to remember Bette Davis. Susan takes her place amid a batch of other beasts all commandeered by the state a white-coated scientist with the manners of a Noel Coward hero but sadly the head of a bug; a pupa as vast as a blimp; a leering bipedal iguana of boundless not to say pointless enthusiasm; and a blob. No sooner have these characters been introduced than by a slightly creaking coincidence the enemy enters the scene. Gallaxhar an evil octopoid from far far away dispatches what appears to be a giant fire hydrant which then stomps around San Francisco and which the monsters must engage and destroy athwart the Golden Gate Bridge. By way of a backup Gallaxhar assembles a force of identical drones whose sole remorseless impulse is to conquer the world. Why pay to see this movie you might ask when you can stay home and watch ""Americas Next Top Model"" and get the same plot for free? The movie is co-directed by Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman who made ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shark Tale"" respectively. I was repelled by both those films which took in-jokes to the verge of implosion and by their grovelling nods to the actors behind the voice-overs--the Will Smith fish had fins like protruding ears the Martin Scorsese one had eyebrows and so on. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" I am glad to report shakes off that complacency; although the narrative makes a minimum of sense the whole thing feels fresher than recent DreamWorks outings. Actors like Reese Witherspoon as Susan and Hugh Laurie as the bughead deliver their lines without obtruding too far and the cheerfully brainless tones of Seth Rogen are such an exact match for the blob that he may never return to live action. Meanwhile the set pieces--Susan roller-skating down San Franciscos hills for example using cars as skates--are carried off with the kind of frantic naivete that the studio was in danger of disdaining and to which even todays children are innately geared to respond. Not heaven knows that the film is lost for references. When Susan is renamed Ginormica by the authorities does that in any way heighten her powers or does it merely betray her origins as a B-movie conceit? By the end I had given up taking notes on the story and was simply scribbling down the titles that it winks at among them ""The Fly"" ""E.T."" ""Jaws"" ""Dr. Strangelove"" ""King Kong"" ""Gullivers Travels"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and yes ""The Blob."" Yet the impression left by the mayhem is not one of knowingness--as was the case with the Shrek franchise say when it rifled through every fairy tale in the book--but one of talismanic glee with the filmmakers touching older tales for good luck as they pass by. There is even a pleasing proto-feminist trace of Disneys ""Beauty and the Beast"" as Susan displays a Belle-like impatience with her fiance and by extension with men in general. The human males in ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" are either loudmouths or wimps; in a short scene involving a courting couple the girl ends up carrying her hobbled beau as if he were a blushing bride. Yet all is not well in this picture because in what some will greet as its boldest retro move and others will deride as vainglorious whimsy it comes in 3-D. Not filmed in two dimensions and then projected in three as is traditionally the practice but shot in three. (And in cinemas without the right equipment it will be screened in two. Got that?) In a recent interview Jeffrey Katzenberg the C.E.O. of DreamWorks explained the new method. ""We use something called InTru3D which combines DreamWorks Animations authoring tools with the latest Intel technology allowing artists to tell a more compelling story and give filmgoers a more exciting immersive 3-D movie experience"" he said. I am not quite sure what an ""authoring tool"" is unless we are discussing the life and works of the late Lord Byron but as I took off my gray-lensed 3-D spectacles at the end of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" I felt not so much immersed as fuzzy with exhaustion. What I had seen struck me less as a herald of shining possibility than as a thrill ride back to the future--back that is to an idea of the future and a stale one at that. If movie nuts still jabber on about ""Citizen Kane"" over the groans of the ordinary viewer that is partly because the technical advances of Orson Welless movie seemed at the time and continue to seem like the bestowals of further meaning; when rooms and the people they contained became visible in unprecedented depth of field something felt enriched and burnished in our apprehension of the social scene and of the lonely soul marooned within it. Compared with that revelation the history of 3-D is no more than an elasticating trick. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" though spirited stuff does not buck the trend; it is fun to have a flaming meteor apparently vanish up your left nostril but you arent really engulfed. You are wowed and wows last no longer than the striking of a match. If this movie matters therefore it is not for its own sake but because it prepares the way. Later this year James Cameron will release ""Avatar"" a science-fiction drama starring Sigourney Weaver in 3-D and that will be the test. Cameron did more with two-dimensional special effects in ""Terminator 2"" than anyone before him and so if he cant conjure depth and dread from an extra dimension nobody can. Ripley vs. Ginormica? We shall see. There must be ways in which ""Shall We Kiss?"" could be made more French than it already is but short of adding a cancan sequence I cant think of any just now. The movie is written and directed by Emmanuel Mouret who also stars and gets to take his clothes off next to Virginie Ledoyen. In case this sounds like a filmmaker tipping the scales in his own favor I should point out that Mouret plays Nicolas a lily-livered gap-toothed math teacher so you could argue that he is correcting the balance. There is a touch of Woody Allen in his persona though when it comes to bodily confidence he makes Woody look like Victor Mature. At one point Nicolas visits a prostitute who is almost as mousy as he is; when she asks him to take a shower before sex he inquires ""Do I have to wash my hair?"" There are two stories here one framed inside the other--a very nineteenth-century device. In the outer one a picture-framer (his profession is no accident) begs a woman he barely knows for ""a kiss without consequences."" In refusing she tells him the cautionary tale of Nicolas who lacking affection suggests to a married friend named Judith (Ledoyen) that she meet his needs. This being Paris Judith concurs and as you might expect the no-strings encounter turns out to be tied up in strings of every sort. What our picture-framer learns is that the inconsequential kiss does not exist and what we learn as the jokes fade from the movie in the second half is that beneath Mourets goofy ditherings is an unremitting moralist gripped by the ethics of temptation. Hence the bleached and bloodless hues of Judiths apartment and the coolly abstract look of her lovemaking with its closeups of a pale hand against black fabric; hence too the level tone in which she Nicolas and her husband--a Schubert-revering pharmacist who reads Leopardi in bed--tend to utter their lines as if reciting from a book. The result is that ""Shall We Kiss?"" puts its viewers in a bind worthy of the lovers themselves should we organize a Socratic symposium on the issues raised by the film or hurl our popcorn violently at the screen?

By Peter Rainer March 28 2009 Save for later Saved In this film publicity still released by DreamWorks Animation LLC Ginormica - voiced by Reese Witherspoon - powers through the atmosphere in a scene from DreamWorks Animations 3D film ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" DreamWorks Animation/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of My overly helpful press notes inform me that ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is ""DreamWorks Animations first InTru 3D Movie wholly conceived developed and authored in 3D.""Just in case you missed the news dear reader ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is in 3-D.Which is fine with me. Ive long been on record as saying that just about anything in 3-D is better than in 2-D and that goes double for animation. I love putting on those glasses and reaching out to touch virtual critters and cucumbers and whatever else they throw at me. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Would ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" still be worth seeing if it was in plain old 2-D? Probably but the addition of the extra D certainly helps. Its an affectionate fairly funny riff on 1950s sci-fi movies which often featured aliens sometimes in the form of gelatinous glop trying to take over Earth before earthlings usually of the military variety save the day. There are also visual tributes to early Mad magazine sci-fi spoofs for those whose memories go back that far (i.e. the parents or grandparents of this films target audience of precocious toddlers). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The voice talent is unusually high-caliber. Reese Witherspoon is the California girl whose encounter with space goo makes her grow 50 feet tall. Her comrades in arms joining her in battling an alien robot include Hugh Lauries Dr. Cockroach Seth Rogens megagloppy B.O.B. and Will Arnetts half-ape half-fish Missing Link. My favorite voice/animation combo however is Stephen Colberts very terrestrial president of the United States. Grade B (Rated PG for sci-fi action some crude humor and mild language.)

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its all about growth. Susan Murphy is just a regular California gal on her wedding day when a meteor strikes making her a redwood-sized bridezilla. Fiance Derek a vapid TV weatherman never promised to love her for bigger and for smaller and dumps her on the spot. In short order Susan is shipped to a secret facility where the military houses mutants including B.O.B. (more formally Bicarbonate Ostylezene Benzoate) a one-eyed haystack of indestructible blue gelatin and Dr. Cockroach a preening man-insect scientist. When theyre dispatched as mankinds last hope against nasty ETs the likable misfits must table their differences and work together in ways that some selfish humans (ahem Derek) have never learned. So really its all about growth. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" doesnt press much of a claim on your heart your funnybone or your memory but its a pleasant enough gag reel. The new DreamWorks animated feature adheres to the studios time-tested formula of packing in pop culture references until the screen stretches at the seams. It adds a second layer of self-referential humor peppering the action with fanboy meta-gags (odd choice for a movie that is so girl-centric). When astronomers spot an incoming spaceship they declare a ""Code Nimoy."" The president of the United States tries to communicate with the aliens through a keyboard solo that opens with the five-note ""Close Encounters"" theme. ""The Fly"" ""The Blob"" ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" and ""The Amazing 50-Foot Woman"" all get their moment in the spotlight. Its elbow-in-the-ribs yuk mongering a big step down after DreamWorks delightful emotion-tugging ""Kung Fu Panda."" I dont think there are any characters here that a child would love. To be fair they wont be bored either. The movie 3D in many theaters is a lot of fun to look at. It opens with the old paddle-ball-in-the-face gag from ""House of Wax"" and every scene has a funky visual playfulness and warmth. The intergalactic invaders arrive in a spaceship that resembles a giant Michael Graves egg timer. Theres an exhilarating excitement to the action scenes -- Susan jams her feet into a couple of convertibles and roller skates to the rescue when the space creeps attack San Francisco. MONSTERS VS. ALIENS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for sci-fi action some crude humor and mild language. The destruction is of the kiddie-safe reverse neutron bomb variety. A lot of property is trashed -- including thrillingly the Golden Gate Bridge -- but nobody gets hurt. Except Susan by that louse Derek. And she moves on supported by her new emotionally committed friends as the bylaws of girl-power fables require. The script tosses grownups a bone fairly often When a White House official summons the nations top minds somebody phones India. The vocal cast is deep but unevenly effective. Reese Witherspoon brings good cheer or chin-up determination to Susan as needed and Seth Rogens chortling B.O.B. sounds as warm and rough as corduroy while Hugh Laurie Kiefer Sutherland and Paul Rudd are merely serviceable. The biggest casting coup is the chief disappointment. Stephen Colbert plays the president (perfect) but hes far funnier in live action than a cartoon figure could hope to be. Computer animation is great and all but theres nothing sillier than a real arched eyebrow.

Thats because it takes you into the mind and maelstrom of an average middle-schooler. To me that world of hall passes and wedgies and orthodontic headgear is one of the most horrific places on Earth. (I never want to be that insecure again) I was a little taken aback when the show - which airs on Wednesday at 8 p.m. - opened with a scene of Internet savvy tweens giving each other pedicures and declaring ""friends paint their friends toenails."" Youd never see pedicures on public TV But perhaps like toenails the show will grow on me. Created by Emily Kapnek a ""Rocket Power"" writer and produced by Klasky-Csupo the creators behind ""Rats"" and ""The Wild Thornberrys"" ""Ginger"" is the future - as if Angelica ruled the malls and junior high school halls having already corrupted the gentler Tommy and Chuckie. Twelve-year-old Ginger (voiced by Melissa Disney) lives on the border between cool and uncool the daughter of a struggling single mom (""SNL"" alum Laraine Newman) who works as a nurse and drives a VW bug. Gingers little brother Carl is the usual dispensable fiend a spying 9-year-old intended to attract boys to this female-skewed show. Popularity was the big issue in the opener entitled ""Ginger the Juvey."" The schools most popular girl Courtney invites Ginger to her birthday. While Ginger deals with the elation and anxiety of this invitation her nemesis the clarinet-playing Miranda plots to engineer the curly redheads social downfall by getting her to steal a bank sign as a birthday gift. The show becomes a pitched battle between insiders and wannabes as Ginger calculates the cost of popularity. As a parent it was hard to find any of the kids likeable in the way that Chuckie and Tommy are. Of course I am the mother of pre-schoolers and babies and I have not yet to tackled the horror of raising teens. Watching ""As Told By Ginger"" a perfectly accomplished toon with a female heroine I felt this was a show I should want to like. That I should identify with Ginger and her desire to befriend the vapid Courtney without sacrificing her integrity. But I didnt. Instead I felt like an awkward tween in a training bra transferred to a new and alien junior high. I did not want to enter this world - or more accurately re-enter it. Perhaps your tween girls will feel differently.

D. and B.O.B. have been released from a secret monster prison in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" Monsters vs. Aliens. (PG) Paramount/DreamWorks (94 min.) Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon. With the voices of Reese Witherspoon Hugh Laurie Seth Rogen. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS. Every so often a moviemaker comes up with a really unhinged yet strangely wonderful idea. Cowboys vs. dinosaurs (""The Valley of Gwangi."") Knights on motorcycles (""Knightriders."") ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein."" ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" The plot is -- well pretty much right there in the title. Aliens are attacking the Earth -- so the Earth finally has to open up the secret monster prison it built years ago and turn the creatures loose. One is a vaguely ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" thing called Missing Link. Another is a not quite ""The Fly"" hybrid named Dr. Cockroach. Theres also a blob named Bob and a giant Japanese insect. The latest addition is a suburban California gal named Susan Murphy who had the misfortune to be hit with a meteorite on her wedding day. Suddenly its ""Attack of the 50-Foot Bride"" -- until the Army locks her up. Then unlocks her along with the other monsters and sends them out to do beastly battle. Its a scenario guaranteed to play to the hearts of horror and sci-fi fans whatever their generation. The 3-D animation occasional gross-out jokes and way-cool beasties and robots play to every 10-year-old chronological or just in spirit. Perpetually spunky Reese Witherspoon gives our reluctant Bridezilla just enough perplexed anguish. Hugh Laurie is the most sophisticated cockroach-headed mad scientist around (he even has a rakish pencil moustache). Seth Rogen -- who frankly until his recent weight loss even looked a bit like the Blob -- gives this goofy goo the soul of a frat boy. Nice too are some of the touches there strictly for die-hard film fans. Yes everyone will notice the ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."" references or the parallels to famous monster films. But that the movie bothers to copy specific shots from ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" or digs up the B-52s ""Planet Claire""? Thats dedication. The movie doesnt quite have the mad inventiveness (or sneaky depth) of a film like ""The Incredibles"" still the standard in things like this. Emotions are glossed over a bit (shouldnt these monsters be a little reluctant to fightfor the country that locked them up?) And the chief alien villain isnt nearly as much fun as Kang and Kodos on ""The Simpsons."" But the 3-D effects are terrific (be sure to see this in a theater thats equipped for the format). Some of the sideshows (including Stephen Colbert as a cocky and utterly useless president and Paul Rudd as a pompadoured TV weathercaster) are quite good as is a climactic attack-on-San Francisco scene. And Bob the Blob -- a grinning gyrating hunk of Dippity-Do goo -- is already my favorite character of a fairly bleak year. Rating note The film contains some mildly gross humor.

The first group Eight-year-olds in black-plastic 3-D horn-rims. My own personal representative accompanied me to the screening and I must say his periodic machine-gun peals of laughter proved at least as entertaining as the movie. The second group fans of Seth Rogen. Well established in the Judd Apatow universe as a somewhat dorky vaguely potatolike (and normally raunchy) comic lead he now takes the screen as B.O.B. a brainless blue blob with one eye and several amusing boundary issues. Somehow animators have so captured Rogens telltale dippy grin that his large globular alter-ego actually resembles him. Really its a startling likeness. And hes a riot. Co-directed by Shark Tales Rob Letterman and voice actor Conrad Vernon (Madagascar Escape 2 Africa) Monsters vs. Aliens is about what youd expect from a couple of DreamWorks regulars spangly and derivative. The cast is starry the cribbing is unabashed and the 3-D animation runs from nifty to yowzah (its worth the extra cost if you have a choice). True the story doesnt amount to much but the plot tends to take a back seat when youve got a not-quite-50-foot version of Reese Witherspoon duking it out with a mighty alien robot alongside the Golden Gate Bridge. Witherspoon is the voice of Susan an unfortunate bride-to-be who gets clobbered by a meteorite on her wedding day causing her to crash through the roof of the church and thus freak out the groom (Paul Rudd). Men in jackboots sedate and transport her to a top-secret government facility where shes given a new name (Ginormica) and informed by the gruff General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) that shell be detained for the rest of her life. ""This place is an X-File wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy"" he helpfully explains. There she meets Rogens pile of glop (an gelatinous nod to The Blob) and three more monsters The Missing Link (Will Arnett) a gone-to-seed amphibian jock straight out of the Black Lagoon (speaking of 3D); Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) a bwa-ha-ha-ing mad scientist with the head of a bug; and Insectosaurus a Mothra-like mondo-grub that towers over everything even Ginormica. As fate would have it the meteorite that transmogrified Susan contained Quantonium the most powerful substance in the universe. Its being tracked by Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) a megacephalic four-eyed extraterrestrial conqueror in a Dracula cape. Naturally the alien probe is his. Ginormica and her merry band of monsters are released from prison to fend off the alien invasion -- at the behest of the nitwit U.S. President (Stephen Colbert) who refuses to go down in history as the guy ""who was in office when the world came to an end."" Like the rest of the cast Colbert puts plenty of juice into his line readings but character development seems to be in short supply -- unless you count B.O.B.s flirtation with a green jello mold (funny) or Susans battles with low self-esteem (dull). ""Im not a monster Im just a regular person"" she objects all Elephant Man indignation. By the time we reach the climax shes turned into Dorothy and the movies gone Oz. (B.O.B. is the Scarecrow Docs the Tin Man and Links the Cowardly Lion.) By the time its over its gone Strangelove In the middle of the credits moments after setting up its heroes for a sequel Monsters vs. Alien pulls one of the more apocalyptic stunts ever slapped on the end of a childrens movie. I was confounded. But the 8-year-old demographic approved. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PS4 Games at Amazon from 10 + free shipping w/ Prime City Jogger Baby Strollers from 156 + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Media San Francisco Chronicle Monsters vs. Aliens Animation. Starring the voices of Reese Witherspoon Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogen. Directed by Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Unlike ""Coraline"" and a number of recent animations ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a straight-up childrens film. There are knowing asides references and in-jokes every few minutes inserted to poke parents into a semblance of consciousness but mostly this one is for the kiddies. The movie is reasonably entertaining though it helps to be 6 years old. That its shot in 3-D is no small advantage. If you want to see a glowing green asteroid coming toward you 3-D is the way to go. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a movie with some spectacular visual sequences including the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge in a protracted battle between an alien robot and a gigantic Earth woman who tries to hold up the bridge long enough for commuters to make it back to solid ground. You dont see that every day. Nor do you see a gigantic Earth woman driving down the hills of downtown San Francisco with her feet in two cars using them as though they were skates. This is all good. But can we talk about ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" as though it were you know an actual movie? After all it is. An animated film is an actual movie too and not merely some sacred missive designed to touch the hearts of children and bring the joy of laughter to the young at heart. The cool stuff - like 3-D and collapsing bridges - may get filmmakers halfway there but to make it all the way home they need the usual movie elements like a good story and vivid characters and here ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" comes up short. In fact this is where ""M. vs. A."" begins to feel a little like a throwback.

Photo Max Nash AFP/Getty Images Image 9 of 9 Movie review Monsters vs. Aliens 1 / 9 Back to Gallery If you were a kid (or the parent of a young child) 10 or 15 years ago you probably remember that virtually every animated film had the same story. The story was about an outcast within a tight community usually a kingdom or a tribe of some kind. In the standard version nobody takes the outcast seriously until some external force threatens the destruction of the community. And then out of nowhere the outcast emerges to save the day to wipe out the invading force and become revered and appreciated. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" reprises that old pattern on a grander scale. Our heroine Susan is hit by a meteorite on her wedding day causing her to grow to the size of an office building. The government captures her and she is put away in a facility with other ""monsters"" - all of them scorned all of them imprisoned and forgotten. Theres a blue blob a cockroach man and somebody who looks like the Creature From the Black Lagoon. Theyre doomed to live their lives in confinement until one fine day aliens attack and a general gets the idea to turn the monsters loose on the aliens. The problem with this kind of story is that it entails multiple battles but no surprises. The movie also is at cross-purposes in telling the story of Susan the central character. Shes a monster by happenstance not by nature. She has an intense desire to become normal again so that becomes the audiences desire. At the same time the movie is wedded to the ""Shrek"" notion that being monstrous can be a joyous thing. This places an irreconcilable burden on the screenplay with the resulting compromise coming at the expense of the character. Indeed Susan is so vague and generic that without knowing in advance it would be impossible to know she is voiced by Reese Witherspoon who is usually anything but indistinct. The other characters cant fill the hole at the movies center though Seth Rogen is fun as the good-natured brainless blue blob and the wisecracks sight gags and visuals keep ""Monsters"" more or less alive. For locals theres the additional kick of seeing San Francisco represented onscreen though somebody should have told the filmmakers There are no concrete dividers on the Golden Gate Bridge just orange cones. -- AdvisoryWholesome family viewing.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Hollywood rummages much too often through pop cultures attic for stuff to wow the kids. In the case of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" this thought is more observation than criticism. Because as willfully chock-full of the familiar as the animated feature is its also a hoot. So well forgive the fact that it forgoes invention instead mining so many sci-fi flicks that have come before. Its irrepressible fun is kryptonite to these qualms. Co-directed by DreamWorks vets Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" struts its 3D stuff right away. See it in this format. (It also opens today on IMAX.) Honest-to-goodness ""Whoas"" were uttered at a preview screening. They were deserved. Theres something planetarium-groovy about Saturns rings jutting out of the screen or meteor fragments showering the folks just a couple of rows ahead. Loyalists to story were not sure this represents the deepest magic of the movies. But it sure is spellbinding and the storys got its charms. When a large chunk of of glowing meteor lands in Modesto Calif. irradiating bride-to-be Susan Murphy she grows and grows and grows. Shes voiced for maximum likability and gumption by Reese Witherspoon. Her fiance Derek (Paul Rudd) is a weatherman angling to be an anchor. When he puts the kibosh on their honeymoon for a job interview you get a whiff of his character. How interesting it is for youngsters to get an early gander at marital compromise we can only guess not very. But this is the rub of so many animated features They seem crafted by hipsters and newbie parents who fear their own boredom as much as that of the ticket-buying guardians in the audience. The couples strained relationship isnt half as entertaining as the newly found bonds Susan makes with a group of misfits once she becomes Ginormica. Captured like Gulliver by a Lilliputian army shes confined to a top-secret facility run by Gen. W. R. Monger. Its a loaded name but Kiefer Sutherland does amusing things with his puffed-up man in a uniform. Incarcerated since the 1950s the monsters are a B-movie Whos Who. Seth Rogen voices B.O.B. an endearing dimwitted translucent blob with one eye. A particularly clever sequence finds B.O.B stuck like a wad of gum to the massive metal foot of a robot as it tromps down the streets of San Francisco. A personal favorite is Insectosaurus the huge grub with big eyes and a screeching way of communicating. Mothra anyone? Will Arnetts Missing Link resembles the Creature from the Black Lagoon. A laboratory mishap transformed a researcher not into a fly but into Dr. Cockroach Ph.D (Hugh Laurie). Talented rivals DreamWorks and Pixar (in ""WALLE"") have both made a companionable character out of one of Earths most detested insects -- which gets one wondering all over again about the spontaneous generation of ideas and jokes. The monsters freshly forged bond and Susans new super-identity as a 49-foot-11-inch woman get tested when Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) arrives from outer space. But before the multi-eyed alien lands and Earth stands still the president (Stephen Colbert) tries to negotiates with Gallaxhars robot emissary. Kudos to the character animators for creating an onscreen avatar who looks nothing like Comedy Centrals genius of snark. ""Commander do something violent"" he barks. Its a funny line. But if we could hit pause on our adult pleasures we might wonder how this action sequence works on the imaginations of our wee-est. Weve seen it all before. So its impressive violence is rendered a knowing joke. The words ""E.T. Go Home"" are painted on a zipping missile. Ha ha we say. Warning But theres even more spectacular destruction ahead. It seems the more enjoyable a movie the easier it is to overlook the glee its makers take in unmaking stuff. We start to feel like curmudgeons for even pointing it out. But point we must.

"3D flick packs in adventure and laughs | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsLifeParent3D flick packs in adventure and laughsDo not adjust your senses or remove your funny spectacles.With a nod to The Blob B.O.B. is a dimwit with a heart of gold in Monsters vs. Aliens.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 27 2009 Animated sci-fi comedy featuring the voices of Reese Witherspoon Seth Rogen Hugh Laurie Rainn Wilson Kiefer Sutherland Will Arnett Stephen Colbert and Paul Rudd. Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon. At major theatres. G  Do not adjust your senses or remove your funny spectacles.Article Continued BelowYou are about to return to the 1950s through the medium of the riotously retro Monsters vs. Aliens and its UFO invasion silliness. But first a word about format. This is the movie DreamWorks Animation hopes will secure it a 3D beachhead in popcorn palaces and the onscreen results bode well. The extra dimension is the best yet in the current 3D craze it draws you in without smacking you in the face apart from an opening paddleball wallop. Viewers in traditional 2D - and there will be plenty of those - neednt feel stoppered by lack of an eye-popper. This film has hidden depths especially for adults who mistakenly think Monsters vs. Aliens is only for kids.Dig the Eisenhower-era intrigue patriotic Yankee monsters are summoned to save the planet from a four-eyed alien nerd (who probably hangs with Marvin the Martian). The film is nominally set in our current fractured times but the vibe is pure 50s flying-saucer paranoia with ray guns set on ""stun"" rather than ""kill.""Youd have to be the parents or even grandparents of todays tots to recognize all the hilarious references to classic sci-fi movies of decades past. These monster mash-ups are rad dad Ginormica Voiced by Reese Witherspoon and also known as Susan shes a bride-to-be from Modesto Calif. whose close encounter with a meteorite transforms her into a giantess just one inch shorter than the title freak of Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman; B.O.B. A sapphire splodge with no brain one eye and an insatiable appetite for junk food its Seth Rogen getting jiggy with the icky entity from The Blob; Dr. Cockroach PhD Half mad scientist half cockroach all Hugh Laurie and a big hat-tip to the lab accident of The Fly; The Missing Link An upright and uptight reptile voiced by Will Arnett who is missing no links at all to Creature From the Black Lagoon; Insectosaurus A skyscraper-sized and almost silent homage to Japans monsteriffic Toho Studios and its buggy behemoth from Mothra and countless spin-offs.Its a bit of a stretch to say theyre fighting ""aliens."" Its really just one megalomaniac midget who goes by the vainglorious handle Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson). He does however have four eyes and the ability to clone himself into innumerable Gallaxhars. He also has a spectacularly clumsy giant robot to assist his dirty deeds such as smashing up San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge in the films grandest set piece.Theres more. With nods to Dr. Strangelove (and a certain recent White House occupant) Kiefer Sutherland voices monster wrangler Gen. W.R. Monger while Stephen Colbert plays the clueless and over-caffeinated U.S. president.Monger is the guy who summons the monsters from the laid-low Gitmo where theyve been imprisoned since the 1950s - all except new arrival Susan/Ginormica who was to marry her TV weatherman beau Derek (Paul Rudd) before fate and gamma rays intervened.Co-directors Rob Letterman (Shark Tale) and Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2) have packed everything but a tray of Rice Krispie squares into the tale (although there is a Jell-O mould) and its clear the project was near and dear to their geeky lil hearts.Its almost too much love. A surfeit of characters and a committee-written plot that combines outer-space Armageddon with female empowerment makes for an embarrassment of riches.You can understand why Letterman and Vernon got carried away though since these monsters are so loveable - especially Rogens amorphous B.O.B. who is dumber than the sack of hammers he could consume with one gulp.And Gallaxhar is also pretty funny. He wants to take over the planet but he learned how to fight by watching old Three Stooges movies.Monsters vs. Aliens has obvious franchise potential and lets hope that idea flies. Part II could make better use of these motley mutants now that weve gotten to know them.How about Paris for the locale as hinted in the film? Its the city of the Eiffel Tower and inhabitants who often consider everybody else to be monsters and aliens.MoreFun-filled family events March 27th to April 3rdMovies for toddlers Read more about Stephen ColbertThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

DreamWorks Animation LLC hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Animation LLC Motley Crew Susans new friends including a blue blob named B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen) are a bit rough around the edges. DreamWorks Animation LLC DreamWorks Animation -- the outfit behind Shrek and Kung Fu Panda -- says that from now on all of its animated films will be released in 3-D and in the first few moments of Monsters vs. Aliens that future seems like it might be fun. Asteroids whiz past your head before youve quite got your 3-D glasses settled on your nose and a few seconds later a character bounces a paddle ball in your face. At this point the filmmakers figure theyve established that their gimmick works and are ready to roll out a little plot. A plot resurrected from 1950s sci-fi actually -- a radioactive meteorite lands just a little too close to a wedding and when the groom tells the bride (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) that shes ""glowing"" he means it literally. And shes not just glowing shes also growing. Really big. Like Attack of the 50-Foot-Woman big. When the government spirits her away to its secret monster warehouse she discovers shes not the only 50s-feature creature theyve locked up. Theres a half-ape-half-fish missing link a mad scientist with the head of a cockroach and a friendly but empty-headed blue blob (voiced perhaps inevitably by Seth Rogen). No literally empty-headed ""Turns out you dont need a brain"" he announces. True enough at least for this movie. Its designed as these things often are to work on several levels -- theres slapstick for the kiddies pop-culture references for their parents and 50s sci-fi campiness for granny and gramps wholl be old enough to recognize a good Godzilla or Mothra joke should it crop up. With all that going on -- not to mention a five-eyed squid who wants to rule the world Stephen Colbert as president and a 3-D battle that flattens the Golden Gate bridge -- youd think Monsters vs. Aliens would be plenty engaging. Instead its mostly an excuse to hop from one depth-perception exercise to the next. And once youve seen a couple theyre not really reason enough to keep watching. It would be oversimplifying to say that where Pixar builds films like Wall-E around emotional stories DreamWorks builds its pictures around gimmicks. (Though what else could you call the Jerry Seinfeld shtick in Bee Movie or the martial-arts shtick in Kung-Fu Panda?) Here directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon push so hard for three-dimensionality -- and theyre so reliant on it -- that they basically have their animators putting sightlines before storylines; they set up practically every scene so that something in it can be sent careening at your head. After a while you can see the setups happening -- and once you do the careening gets predictable. Which gets old really fast.

ABOUT THE MOVIEMonsters vs. Aliens   out of fourVoices Reese Witherspoon Hugh Laurie Will Arnett Seth Rogen Rainn Wilson Paul Rudd Kiefer SutherlandDirectors Rob Letterman and Conrad VernonDistributor DreamWorks AnimationRating PG for sci-fi action some crude humor and mild languageRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Too often 3-D technology does not serve a story adequately. Three-dimensional sequences whether animated or live action can feel more gimmicky than integral to the tale. Happily such is not the case with the entertaining Monsters vs. Aliens. Dazzling colors winning characters and energetic visual effects all work in concert with the 3-D animation serving to intensify the experience. While the message of personal empowerment is familiar witty dialogue enhances the lively story. An impressive vocal cast features such comic talents as Seth Rogen Stephen Colbert Paul Rudd and Will Arnett. Actors better known for their dramatic skills -- Hugh Laurie Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland -- round out the cast impeccably. Witherspoon stars as Susan whose wedding to the self-absorbed Derek (Rudd) is marred when an apparent meteorite crashes on Earth. Radiation renders her mega-gigantic. She is spirited off by government operatives and deposited in a top-secret facility. In a funny montage its revealed that monsters have been put there to keep the populace tranquil. The film pays affectionate homage to 50s sci-fi horror while also offering topical one-liners. The U.S. president is voiced by Colbert a stroke of inspired casting. He greets an alien spaceship and plays the five signature notes from Close Encounters of the Third Kind setting the tone for his officious daffy character. ""Do something violent"" he bellows at the military. The alien leader Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) threatens the populace though he insists his takeover bid is purely business. General W.R. Monger (Sutherland) puts the monsters in play. Susan dubbed Ginormica is joined by B.O.B. (Rogen) Dr. Cockroach (Laurie) and The Missing Link (Will Arnett). A battle scene on the Golden Gate Bridge involving a pile-up of cars vs. an enormous alien robot vs. the monsters is eye-popping. With its mix of sweetness and light satire Monsters vs. Aliens is a playful fantasy augmented by spirited action and a delightfully cheeky attitude.

"Review Monsters vs. Aliens - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AliensReview Monsters vs. AliensMarch 27 2009|Betsy Sharkey | FILM CRITIC What does it say about the current state of cinema that ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" animated in a 50s retro style albeit with an assist from the latest in 3-D technology and aimed roughly at the under-12 set turns out to be the movie making one of the strongest statements about female empowerment out there today?It is Reese Witherspoons Susan a small-town Modesto girl with modest dreams who ultimately crashes right through the glass ceiling of the old-boys-network of monsters -- both metaphorically and literally all five stories of her -- to lead a band of mutant brothers on a mission to save the world.The film also creates one of the most endearing characters around and frankly one of the best roles for slacker guys this year in Seth Rogens B.O.B. a sweetly optimistic and slightly slow (and I mean that in every way you might imagine) blob of gelatinous blue something with a single eye and no brain -- and hes better for it especially the brain part.Though ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is far from the first time an animated film has come with a relevant cultural message (last years Oscar-winning ""Wall-E"" had more than a few things to say about consumerism and how we treat the environment) but lets just agree that this story-time version of Feminism 101 is a good thing. Meanwhile its surprisingly satisfying to watch Susan and the boys take on a giant robot an evil alien lord in the form of the many-tentacled purple Rainn (as in Wilson) named Galaxhar the military (yet again it cannot be trusted) the media and self-esteem (Susans needs bolstering her fiance Dereks -- played by Paul Rudd -- needs puncturing) for the good of all man- and woman-kind.Much is being made of ""Monsters vs. Aliens "" 3-D features and the revolution it represents (at least in the ads you absolutely cannot miss even if youre trying hard). Its nice in theory -- there are cool bits thrown in here and there with the random meteor to dodge or the floating teacup and spoon -- but the truth is ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" doesnt need them to work as a film and they never feel like anything more than extras that have been thrown into the mix just because the filmmakers have the power tools to do it. There is no real exploration and realization of the possibilities of the technology that you will see in the lovely darkness of Henry Selicks totally 3-D-infused ""Coraline"" a seamless integration of story and visual style.What directors Rob Letterman who also wrote and directed ""Shark Tale"" and Conrad Vernon who directed ""Shrek 2"" focus on in their first teaming is telling the story which they both had a hand in creating with Letterman also participating in the team sport that is the animation screenplay (credit also goes to Maya Forbes Wally Wolodarsky Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger).The plot here is simple. Meteor hits Susan on the head on her wedding day. Plans change.Instead of heading into the sunset in this case Fresno which has just offered local weatherman/soon-to-be-husband Derek a job shes transformed into an enormous version of herself. Its never easy to be different and Susan pays for this crime by being immediately captured by the military and locked up in a super-secret prison with all the other monsters theyve been collecting over the years.Here Susan begins the process of getting in touch with her inner Ginormica which happens to be the label given her by the very un-PC Gen. W.R. Monger voiced by ""24s"" Kiefer Sutherland who perhaps knows better than anyone about the nefarious double-dealing done in the name of the U.S. government. But as often happens (certainly on ""24"") sometimes the monsters are the only ones who can save you.When a towering lethal and unstoppable robot lands to retrieve the powerful precious stuff that made Susan grow so tall the call comes and the prison doors are unlocked. Ginormica and B.O.B. are joined by the brilliant Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie clearly having fun with this mutant mad scientist role); the Missing Link (Will Arnett) a half-ape half-fish macho man of a beast; and a giant grub called Insectorsaurus whose squeaks are credited to no one. Many battles ensue. Enlightenment comes to the land.The dialogue has its share of the sly grown-up/cultural references that have become de rigueur for DreamWorks projects designed to make sure the adults in the audience dont fidget but there arent enough of them to push this into full-fledged comedy mode. Which means its up to the action/thriller elements to power the film and they are never quite bold enough.So it comes down to the story and the voice actors to carry the day and they have their moments -- particularly the monster crew led by a feisty Witherspoon who brings some of the edgy-fun of her ""Election"" mean-girl to Susan as she grows stronger.The clean lines of the films 1950s retro look work well with the uncluttered straightforward tale and the filmmakers nod to that eras B-movies is a nice one.In fact ""nice"" is the adjective that seems to surface most in trying to pin down the films most salient quality which means that while the film is enjoyable enough it is unlikely to become a classic for us or a ""Shrek"" sort of franchise for DreamWorks.As for Susan? She wins some battles loses others stops wishing shed return to normal and embraces her inner-warrior princess -- now thats a happy ending.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--Monsters vs. AliensMPAA rating PG for sci-fi action some crude humor and mild languageRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In wide release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJames Franco Jonah Hill invited to Seth Rogens Sausage...January 29 2014The Collective helps YouTube stars go mainstreamAugust 7 2012Movie review Gullivers TravelsDecember 25 2010On the Set Jack Black in Gullivers TravelsOctober 31 2010More movies will pop out at youJanuary 2 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTAliensMonstersCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-monsters27-2009mar27,0,7224061.story",200,monstersvs.aliens20,monstersvs.aliens,latimes

Monsters vs. Aliens Directed by Rob Letterman Conrad Vernon Animation Action Adventure Comedy Family Sci-Fi PG 1h 34m By A. O. SCOTTMARCH 26 2009 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Susan (a k a Ginormica the voice of Reese Witherspoon) -- a bride-to-be who has a mishap that turns her into a giant -- and the characters of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" by DreamWorks Animation. Credit Paramount Pictures ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" cheerfully converts the two major sources of cinematic terror -- invaders from outer space and inhuman ungodly terrestrial creatures -- into wacky goofy familiar figures. The movie directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon from a many-authored script comes out of DreamWorks Animation and offers the latest twist on the easygoing parodic formula refined in the studios ""Shrek"" franchise and last years ""Kung Fu Panda.""Just as ""Shrek"" and its successors pushed aside the sweet enchantment of traditional fairy tale movies in favor of belching and winking (with a saving spoonful of sugar at the end) so does ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" turn fright and apocalypse into strenuous noisy 3-D fun.The film like ""Coraline"" and ""Bolt"" tries to take 3-D technology beyond gimmickry and to make it the basis for a new kind of visual spectacle. Since not all theaters are equipped to show the movie this way it has to work in its flat version as well and perhaps partly as a result the effects are often subtle noticeable less when objects or characters jump off the screen than when they move laterally across it.""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is no better than most family-friendly animated entertainment but there does seem to be more of it. Everything looks bigger and rounder. The environment is deeper and thicker. The blob of blue goo with one eye and Seth Rogens voice is more palpably quiveringly slimy.That blob named B.O.B. is an entirely predictable supporting character in a movie like this the dumb one whose off-the-wall observations and behind-the-beat non sequiturs provide a steady stream of mild and easy laughs. Somehow Mr. Rogen whose next live-action vehicle opens in a few weeks keeps postponing the moment when we tire of him. His affable stoner vibe is the best thing in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though perhaps not in itself enough reason to see it. Dont get me wrong the movie is not terrible. On the contrary it is a highly competent smartly engineered delivery system for the very cliches it pretends to subvert.The most surprising of these may be the romantic-comedy convention of an interrupted wedding an apparent disaster that will of course turn out to be a blessing. This is because the would-be bride Susan (Reese Witherspoon) is a charming young woman betrothed to a self-absorbed cad (Paul Rudd) whose eventual comeuppance provides a nice sequel-enabling coda after the crazy action sequences are done.These involve a battle between some monsters including Susan -- who I should mention has a mishap that makes her grotesquely gigantic though since the movies sense of scale is wildly inconsistent its hard to say just how gigantic -- and what is technically only one alien a many-legged many-eyed intergalactic imperialist voiced by Rainn Wilson. San Francisco is destroyed and a few other kind of cool things happen but in spite of its striving for visual novelty the movie is curiously unmemorable partly because nearly all of its humor depends on your having seen something like it before even if you havent.So in addition to Mr. Rogens dumb blob there is a brainy scientist-monster (Hugh Laurie) a vain macho monster (Will Arnett) and a speechless fuzzy gigantic monster that provides the films gratuitous hat-tip to the Japanese anime tradition.These earthbound monsters live in government-imposed quarantine overseen by a general with a buzz cut and a drill sergeants bark provided by Kiefer Sutherland. Everyone goes whirling through the air fires off some wisecracks and generally has a good time. You probably will too even if you feel a little cheated in the end.""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some semiviolent action sequences with implied fatalities.MONSTERS VS. ALIENSOpens on Friday nationwide.

To which B.O.B. replies quite cheerfully ""Turns out you dont need one"" Dr. Cockroachs condescension is a calumny against the movies only winning character and against the verve of Seth Rogens terrific vocal performance. (The gargle in his voice makes him sound like hes channeling Andy Devine.) As for B.O.B.s response there might be something to it. This movie has a stunted brain and probably doesnt need a better one given the appeal of its premise and the beauty of its animation. But see it only if you need a retro-monster fix and in 3-D to offset the no-D script. On the day before I saw it I received an email from a reader who had just caught up with Pixars 2-D ""WALL-E"" on DVD. ""My suggestion to you for a perspective on the quality of Monsters vs. Aliens is to also watch it in 2-D"" he wrote. ""Compare this new movie to WALL-E and then write the review."" The readers apples-to-apples logic seemed reasonable enough but DreamWorks and Pixar are always apples and oranges since the rival studios play the animation game by different rules. Pixars emphasis is on storytelling -- screenplays as inventive and adventurous as the writers know how to make them -- and on the pleasures of characterization that flow from a powerful tale richly told. DreamWorks favors raffish scripts celebrity voices jokey topical references and animation that grabs attention with bold design. ENLARGE Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (voiced by Hugh Laurie) and B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" Paramount Pictures ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a visual feast and a narrative famine. The 3-D version begins with an optical joke involving a paddle-ball. Yet the process serves mainly as a measured enhancement of action sequences and startling vistas that can stand on their own two dimensions -- chubby planes and choppers reminiscent of Bruce McCall paintings; a giantess surfing San Franciscos hilly streets with her feet planted in cars that function as skates; a battle that trashes the Golden Gate Bridge; the destruction of the alien space ship and the dramatic use of such cavernous spaces as a Strangelovian war room and a secret compound built to house a group of monsters that the government has been collecting since the 1950s. DVD Focus ENLARGE Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1958) At 49 feet and 11 inches the heroine of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" doesnt quite measure up to Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes) the title character of this camp classic. Nancys growth spurt comes from an alien encounter on the California desert and her special effects are from hunger; the movie was made at a time when digital referred to articulated stalks extending from hands. No matter though; the movie has taken on an extended life of its own and reading the comments about it on the Internet Movie Database is almost as much fun as sitting through it. ENLARGE E.T. (1982) Sure Steven Spielbergs alien-in-suburbia masterpiece plays so often on cable that you almost dont have to rent it but every time it does I discover new details and choke up at every point youre supposed to. Its astonishing that the filmmaker was able to keep his story full of action and free of treacle and an enduring scandal that it lost a best-picture Oscar to the ponderous ""Gandhi."" (When the latter won I wrote ""It makes perfect sense. Gandhi was everything the voting members of the Motion Picture Academy would like to be -- moral tan and thin."") ENLARGE Tampopo (1986) Ive made a brief reference once before to the kiss in this now-obscure Japanese comedy the funniest movie ever made about food sex and film genres. (Juzo Itami directed from his own original -- truly original -- script.) With the advent of ""Shall We Kiss?"" though I cant resist mentioning it again. The smooch in question fills a 45-second scene during which a Yakuza smoothie and his girlfriend pass a raw egg yolk from mouth to mouth -- seven times before the yolk breaks. Its a foodies dream of heavenly bliss. --Joe Morgenstern But oh the cavernous spaces in the story -- its as if a gaggle of summer interns had been told to sketch out a little script while the DreamWorks animation wizards were creating their gorgeous images. The heroine a California girl named Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is hit by a radioactive meteor on her wedding day grows 49 feet 11 inches tall then finds herself captured renamed Ginormica and confined to that government compound until a desperate American president throws all of the monsters against a massive alien invasion. Theres a perfunctory feminist subtext -- Susan shedding a fatuous fiance and discovering her own powers -- but her graphic charms not to mention her towering gams cant compete with the deadening effect of the plot. The biggest battle in ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is banality vs. originality and banality carries the day. Shall We Kiss? ""Shall We Kiss?"" gives us storytelling as art. Emmanuel Mourets romantic drama in French with English subtitles is expert intricate ineffably droll ultimately provocative and entirely enchanting. Its actually a story within a story. Emilie and Gabriel played by Julie Gayet and Michael Cohen meet by chance one day in Nantes. Shes beautiful hes eager and we have every reason to assume that they will indeed kiss then carry on from there. But no she forestalls the inevitable by telling him about another couple Judith (Virginie Ledoyen) and her dear friend Nicolas who is played by the writer-director. The essence of their story is familiar enough; Judith is married Nicolas is needy and they have an affair. But how they get to having it and how they rationalize it is intriguing in a way that cant be separated from the absurd things they say while doing it. Imagine two extremely verbal lovers a modern-day Candide and his irony-free co-conspirator who seem never to have seen a French film about love and sex let alone understand that theyre in one. They perform their earnest foreplay in the spirit of therapy; one of the sexiest scenes in the movie has Judith and Nicolas sitting next to one another on a bed back to the camera discussing each move before making it. And their sex amounts to sophisticated stand-up even when theyre lying down. ENLARGE Virginie Ledoyen Emmanuel Mouret and Frederique Bel in ""Shall We Kiss?"" Music Box Films One of the several games the movie plays is allowing us to get ahead of it or at least to think thats what were doing. In fact every expectation is foiled by a surprise the narrative keeps folding back on itself like an origami construction and the tone changes as the question posed in the title is examined ever more closely. A simple kiss is all that Gabriel asks of Emilie when they first meet a kiss of no consequence. But she rejects the very notion that there is such a thing -- ""Before a kiss is given no one knows if it will be big or small"" -- and her rejection is in keeping with the deeper nature of the film a moral tale told in the tradition of Eric Rohmer and sometimes in the style of Woody Allen. The cast which includes Stefano Accorsi as Judiths husband and Frederique Bel as Nicolass girlfriend is just about flawless I particularly enjoyed Virginie Ledoyen who looks a bit like the young Geena Davis has a lovely speaking voice and ponders thoughts with the solemnity of Marilyn Monroe. The sound track uses liberal helpings of Tchaikovsky and Schubert to enhance the comic mood as well as to underscore genuine feelings when the comedy turn serious. And the film does take that fateful turn. In a time of reflexive irony when movies dare not end with a kiss this one restores the climactic beauty of lips touching lips.

(Paramount) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 26 2009 337 PM What kid doesnt love monsters or aliens? Our unkillable affection for ghouls and creepazoids fuels ""Monsters Vs. Aliens""but like a B-movie spaceship made out of kitchen plates the gas runs out halfway through. While it has a crisp 3-D look and nice vocal performances by Reese Wither-spoon Kiefer Sutherland and Seth Rogen this action-comedy will seem fresh only to 8-year-olds -- though it may give parents an excuse to introduce some of the 50s horror movies it parodies. Susan (Witherspoon) is a bride-to-be preparing for her wedding day when an asteroid lands right on top of her. Luckily she isnt hurt -- except for the unfortu-nate side effect of growing 50 feet tall. Susan is captured by the U.S. military and brought to a top-secret underground facility where the government has been keeping a team of monsters under wraps since the Eisenhower era. Now code-named Ginormica Susan befriends the blob-like B.O.B. (Rogen) the insect-headed Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) the half-ape/half-fish Missing Link (Will Arnett) and a huge childlike bug called Insectosaurus. When an out er space tyrant threatens the planet Gen. W.R. Monger (Sutherland) convinces the President (an underutilized Stephen Colbert) to unleash the beasts to save the world. The B-movie creature-feature riffs make for fun visual punch lines and anyone with an affection for ""The Blob""""The Fly""and ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman""will find the movie more engaging than last years ""Igor""or Tim Burtons ""The Corpse Bride."" Although the creatures lack the inspiration of their counterparts in Pixars ""Monsters Inc.""Witherspoons breathy tartness Rogens marble-mouthed cuddliness and Lauries haughtiness will help time zip by for adults. (Sutherlands growly gung-ho turn is Southern-fried silly and nearly unrecognizable.) Sadly faster than a science experiment going awry the movie falls apart. Its main alien the spidery multi-eyeballed Gallaxhar (a dull Rainn Wilson) lets a giant robot do his bidding early on and when it comes time for him to fight Susan -- a chance for our heroine to discover the giantess within -- the movie gets chaselike and lumbering. The 3-D too seems like an afterthought a last-ditch gimmick to play off the films 50s origins. As was the case with a lot of those films the idea is better than the actual stitched-together creation. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The films opening scenes deposit the audience somewhere in the middle of the rings of Saturn with a parsecs-wide vastness that is out of this world. Every kid in the screening I attended blurted out a stunned ""Whoa"" and so did most of the grown-ups We were witnessing not just the beginning of a film but the start of the next phase of blockbuster-movie technology like it or not.The rest of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" unfortunately brings us slowly back to Earth. The latest computer-animated production from DreamWorks - home of ""Shrek"" ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"" - is a perfectly acceptable family movie. The characters are cute even when theyre ugly and the script has the expected mixture of things going boom gross-out slapstick for the kids and arch pop-culture cross-referencing for Mom and Dad. My sixth-grade daughter and her little pal happily gave it a thumbs-up and if thats all you need to know go with God and Jeffrey Katzenberg.If the movies 3-D visuals are above-average though everything else just feels average including the motley-crew story line that pits a heroine and her wacky friends against a silly villain. Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is a modest young woman in Modesto Calif. whos about to be married to a vain twit of a TV weatherman (Paul Rudd). Shes clocked by a falling meteorite outside the church and instantly transformed into a giantess dubbed Ginormica by the US Army and spirited away to an underground facility somewhere in the desert. (Turn right at Area 51 I think.)Her prison-mates represent a nifty cross section of 1950s movie monsters names changed to protect the DreamWorks legal department. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a lab-suited mad scientist with the head of a bug (i.e. The Fly); the Missing Link (Will Arnett) is an egotistical gill-man (The Creature From the Black Lagoon); Insectosaurus is a grub the size of the Chrysler building (Mothra crossed with Godzilla). Funniest of all - the best thing in the movie really - is B.O.B. a cheerful protoplasmic Blob with a brain of Jell-O and the raspy slobbo voice of Seth Rogen.Susan/Ginormica of course is the 50-Foot-Woman not in attack-mode as in the 1958 movie but crippled by low self-esteem (since all modern family movies have to stop and smell the empowerment). She gets her groove back when a four-eyed alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) sends his giant robot to Earth to seek out the rare element contained in the meteorite which is now in her. Mayhem and the spectacular demise of the Golden Gate Bridge ensue.Its not worth kicking too hard against ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" since it does its job reasonably well and its use of 3-D is superb from the in-your-face moments (theres a sly shout-out to the paddleball man in 1953s pioneering 3-D film ""House of Wax"") to the larger use of space and spaciousness. The visual architecture of this movie has been thoroughly and imaginatively thought out which is more than I can say for the flat script written by co-directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon with four - count em four - others.The bright enthusiastic performances from Rogen Witherspoon Laurie et al. put ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" over not the dialogue that trundles along a well-worn family movie rut. Rudd displays none of his sneaky charm as the fiance - turns out you need to see this actor to get the joke - and the same goes for Stephen Colbert as the US president whos drawn much funnier than he sounds like a Mort Drucker caricature in a vintage 60s Mad magazine. In general though the animation isnt terribly impressive if you take away the 3-D; the monsters are fetchingly bizarre but all the women look like Bratz dolls.The big finale with our monster heroes battling an army of cloned Gallaxhars feels like ""The Incredibles"" stirred into ""WALL-E"" with a little Leni Riefenstahl on the side; its hectic noisy effective familiar. I wanted more personally or perhaps something elegantly less. Maybe weve been spoiled by Pixars patented outside-the-box approach to digital family entertainment.Or maybe that title just sets the bar too high. If a movies called ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" dont you want to see more than five monsters - one of them an attractive if plus-size woman - and a lot more than one measly alien? DreamWorks has dreamed up a beguiling three-dimensional world but it hasnt yet figured out exactly who to put in it.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

No dorky plastic glasses no alien ooze flying at my head.More full disclosure I liked it.An amalgam of the vintage sci-fier Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman and Pixars Monsters Inc. (come on DreamWorks admit it) Monsters vs. Aliens is a goofy computer-animated romp that works just fine in the traditional moviegoing format. (Despite the ""InTru 3D"" hype only a third of theaters nationwide will be showing the poppin-in-your-face version.)The plot of course is completely grounded in reality A planet in a far-off galaxy explodes sending a meteorite crashing to Earth - specifically to the California church grounds where one perky Susan Murphy (voice of Reese Witherspoon) is about to be wed.But before she can say ""I do"" shes flattened by the extraterrestrial projectile.And when she emerges shes glowing green her hair turns platinum white and she starts to grow - and grow and grow. Her would-be husband (Paul Rudd) a narcissistic TV weathercaster flees in horror.So does everyone else.Captured by the military (shes drugged and tied like Gulliver on the Lilliput shores) Susan is taken to a top-secret prison where the government holds mutants and monsters.""This place is X-Files wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a paranoid conspiracy"" explains Gen. W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) who oversees the operation and introduces Susan to Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) the half-fish/half-ape Missing Link (Will Arnett) the one-eyed quaking blue mass BOB (Seth Rogen) and the gargantuan Insectosaurus (a speechless monster that looks like a creature from Hayao Miyazakis sketchbook).And here apparently Susan - renamed Ginormica - is to spend the rest of her days.Not so fast Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) a four-eyed tentacled nutjob from outer space is invading Earth with his army of alien robot clones and its left to Susan and her fellow monsters to save the day and the world.Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (Shark Tale and Shrek 2 respectively) Monsters vs. Aliens moves from one big wild-action set piece to the next (a battle on the Golden Gate Bridge a face-off on Gallaxhars spaceship). Susan is rendered with huge almond-shaped eyes and towering cheekbones (shes a babe) the monsters are wisecracking and weird and lots of stuff happens in the foreground of the frame - so if youre wearing those 3-D glasses get ready to duck.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Monsters vs. Aliens Has Dreamworks finally made its Pixar movie? Slate Sign In Sign Up Monsters vs. Aliens Has Dreamworks finally made its Pixar movie? Monsters vs. Aliens Has Dreamworks finally made its Pixar movie? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 26 2009 219 PM Monsters vs. Aliens Has Dreamworks finally made its Pixar movie? By Jessica Winter Monsters vs. Aliens Not to let any unnecessary ideology creep into a review of a fun animated movie but lets get this out of the way up front Monsters vs. Aliens (DreamWorks Animation) is a film for children with a female lead. She is not the love interest or the helpmate or the mom. Nor is she a princess or princesslike. She does not marry a prince or a prince-manque. She does not marry at all. She tries to get married but she is struck by a meteor on her wedding day (typical) which transforms her into an unmarriageable world-saving 49-foot-11-inch superfreak and-- thank you O bountiful movie gods--a Strong Female Protagonist. (Or as my more skeptical viewing companion put it ""a strong female protagonist who just happens to be ultra-skinny with big boobs and a pneumatic butt and who sometimes wears a catsuit."" Touche.) We can also think of saucer-eyed Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) aka Ginormica as the majestic figure on the prow of the DreamWorks Animation galleon as it heads into uncharted waters Starting with MvA the studio will be making all of its films in 3-D which means higher-priced tickets added security against bootlegging and--oh yeah--a more absorbing visual experience. (In this gamble DreamWorks has good company James Camerons first post-Titanic narrative feature Decembers outer-space quest Avatar is in 3-D and Pixars forthcoming Up will open this years Cannes festival in three dimensions.) Though it begins with a flinch-inducing game of paddleball and frequently arranges for characters to reach a hand into the audience MvA for the most part stays out of your personal space; instead the multilayered picture tends to have a gently immersive effect akin to a stroll through the worlds most expensive diorama. Advertisement The 3-D format also enhances the movies retro-futurist spirit Starting with its pulp-tastic title and the Soylent Green accents of its early scenes MvA is a loving parody-homage to 1950s creature features like Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman The Fly and The Blob. The newly gargantuan Susan--soon to be dumped by her insipid fiance (Paul Rudd) on grounds of excessive tallness--wakes up in a top-secret government facility where she shares what looks like an airplane hangar with fellow ""monsters"" Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) a bug/man; the Missing Link (Will Arnett) a 20000-year-old ape/fish; the botched snack-food experiment B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) a transparent voracious blob the color of Vanish Drop-Ins; and the mute/scary/adorable 350-foot Insectosaurus. The incarcerated menagerie is under the supervision of General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) but not long after Susan arrives theyre all furloughed to fight the evil alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) who wants to conquer Earth with clones of himself. (More homage The deranged war-room encounters between the crusty general and the idiot president played by Stephen Colbert are a nod to Dr. Strangelove.) What has often eluded DreamWorks ever since its first computer-animated film Antz back in 1998 is how to ensure the taller members of the audience are entertained without resorting to coarse double-entendre and pointless pop-culture referencing (the Shrek franchise was often guilty of both). That is to say that one suspects DreamWorks has long ached to make its very own Pixar movie and with Monsters vs. Aliens the studio finally succeeds. The characterizations are unusually rich for the DW brand Arnetts Missing Link suggests a well-meaning lothario puzzling through a midlife crisis and Rogens literally brainless B.O.B. makes an endearing testament to impenetrable innocence and cheerful cooperation worthy of Ray Bolger or Anna Faris. MvA nails Pixars gift for the glorious non sequitur (for example the presidents olive branch to Gallaxhar which involves a certain deathless cornerstone of 80s synth-pop). But it also captures the offbeat sweetness the unsentimental prizing of teamwork and loyalty the wistful grace notes (viz. a depressed Susan plunking down dolefully on the awning of a gas station like its a park bench). Even the inevitable lets-smash-stuff-up interludes are weirdly heartwarming as when Susans monster buddies due to a momentary miscommunication start pulverizing a white picket fence at their ladyships behest. Jessica Winter Jessica Winter is Slates features editor and the author of the novel Break in Case of Emergency. Right at its center MvA contains the equivalent of a victory lap for the 3-D bandwagon and an early front-runner for Action Sequence of the Year Susan straps on two cars as ad-hoc roller skates and glides into a showdown--monstrous friends in tow--against Gallaxhar on the Golden Gate Bridge as hundreds of terrified tiny commuters run screaming from their cars. This epic set piece contains everything popcorn-movie-goers of all ages have ever asked for a heretofore aimless character surprised and transformed by her own strength and bravery a screen that swallows you up with gorgeous photorealist detail and comic bits of business and above all else the primal and eternal satisfactions of Crash-Wreck-Explode-Destroy. Like much of Monsters vs. Aliens it feels almost as good as getting hit by a meteor.

Posted March 25 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Ginormica is a great name for a woman regardless of her size. As it happens the California girl so designated in the ginormically showy but super-average 3-D animated entertainment Monsters vs. Aliens grows into her moniker the old-fashioned sci-fi way Born plain old Susan Murphy (and voiced by Reese Witherspoon) shes hit on her wedding day with outer-space crud from a falling meteor causing her to expand to 49 feet 11 inches tall. And although at first shes understandably flummoxed by the transformation and really steamed when military types lock her up at a top secret government compound with a hidden society of other mutated freaks the no-longer-plain-old Susan is actually in luck. For one thing shes now got the figure to carry the skinny-leg-jeans look. For another the sudden growth spurt saves her from an ?ill-advised marriage to a self-involved boob. (The doltish groom-to-be voiced by busy Paul Rudd holds the classic punchline job of local TV weatherman.) Shed of her small ways this wonder woman embraces her sky-high feminine power; she becomes a female role model to yes look up to. Monsters vs. Aliens is pitched to families; the cuddly drawing style is safely un-scarily kid-friendly. (Never mind that kids with their steel-trap memories havent forgotten that Pixar already covered the whole disgruntled ogre thing excellently well eight years ago in Monsters Inc.) But like so many animated projects welded in the DreamWorks Factory the movie works hard -- desperately hard -- to be all things to all audience segments. And the visible effort erodes the sense of gaiety of unfettered fun. The portion of the adult audience with moviegoing memories that ?extend back before R2-D2 roamed the galaxy will easily calculate that Ginormica is exactly one inch shorter than the giant femme who sought revenge on a loutish husband in the wonderfully awful 1958 sci-fi specimen Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. This same crowd will also note similarities to plenty of other famous 1950s and 60s-style B movies featuring monsters (irradiated and otherwise) aliens and rudimentary 3-D effects. Ginormica makes friends with her fellow inmates including the brainy bug-eyed Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie); a half-ape half-fish Darwinian oddity dubbed the Missing Link (Will Arnett); and a one-eyed splotch of Blob-like blue goo called B.O.B. (Seth Rogen happily recognizable even disguised as a...thing). Theres also a wordlessly braying 350-foot grub from the school of Mothra called Insectosaurus. Soon the prisoners of this cartoon gulag are conscripted to battle an onslaught of Earth-attacking aliens led by a cranky multi-eyed overlord (Rainn Wilson). Monsters vs. Aliens is trumpeted in promotional material as the first animated feature ""wholly conceived developed and authored in 3-D."" (A team of three-dimensional humans wrote the script which was directed by Shark Tales Rob Letterman and Shrek 2s Conrad Vernon.) But the 3-D accomplishment is in truth a minor selling point. Is the plastic-glasses experience really any more engrossing or serious now than it was in the 1950s with novelties like It Came From Outer Space? These eyes say no. The filmmakers will inevitably have more luck enticing Gen-X Gen-Y and Gen-Whatever ticket buyers -- young adults who swear by Stephen Colbert and Pineapple Express. After all this iPhone crowd gets to watch Rogen in genial stoned-stupid Pineapple Express mode and Colbert himself -- he voices President Hathaway an American Commander-in-Chief who blends all the weak DNA of George W. Bush Dr. Strangeloves President Merkin Muffley and indeed the blowhard host of The Colbert Report. No one though is spared the films constant ingratiating gobbling and repurposing of ?humor attitudes and pop cultural references better appreciated in their original forms -- and this is the smudgy DreamWorks fingerprint left on every animated comedy from Shrek to Shark Tale to Over the Hedge. ?Monsters vs. Aliens sacrifices soul and edge for safety and bland blue goo. Witherspoons ? willowy Ginormica would do well to make a break for freedom leaving more than an ?unworthy fiance far behind.

"Monsters vs. Aliens | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; monsters-vs-aliens ) Monsters vs. Aliens (United States 2009) March 25 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli If this is the brave new world to which 3D is transporting us stop the merry-go-round. I want to get off. Monsters vs. Aliens one of the 2009 big movies designed to highlight where 3D could transport audiences is an example of technology run amok. With a slight light screenplay that required five credited writers the film tells an unimaginative story about an alien invasion of Earth that is foiled by ""monsters."" Of course theyre not really monsters. Theyre just misunderstood. But since theyre in the 3D were too busy watching whizzing comet fragments fly out of the screen to care about things like plot or character development. Its a good thing too because anyone on the lookout for those elements may be a little disappointed. This should not be confused with the vastly superior Monsters Inc. Im sure the average five year-old will be enchanted. But the average five year old watches Teletubbies and Sponge Bob Squarepants. The problem with Monsters vs. Aliens is that all those writers didnt think much about potential audience members on the hairy side of puberty. Oh there are some clever one-liners and the occasional sight gag but there are too few of those moments to keep the adults from becoming restless. Despite a multitude of opportunities to satirize 50s B-grade science fiction and monster movies theres only a little of that (veiled references to Attack of the 50 Foot Woman The Blob The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Fly). Too much would after all confuse the five year olds. And why put thought into a script when you can let the computers send something else whizzing at the audience? Monsters vs. Aliens suffers from the common 3D problems dim lighting poor focus in fast-paced action sequences and too many distractions for the movie to grab the viewer. With Coraline it looked like things might be going in the right direction but Monsters vs. Aliens is a major step backward. Last year the ""K"" of ""Dreamworks SKG"" did a dog-and-pony show proselytizing skeptics to join the True Faith of 3D. Its too bad this is all he has to show for it. Had he come armed with something less obviously recycled his words might not now ring hollow. Susan Murphy (voice of Reese Witherspoon) is getting ready for her wedding day when a meteor strike complicates her perfect small town domestic existence. A substance contained in the meteor causes her to glow green then grow until shes big enough to be called Ginormica. The government arrives before she can say ""I do"" and incarcerates her in a prison for monsters where she makes the acquaintances of other misfits the blobby B.O.B. (Seth Rogan) the aptly named Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) and The Missing Link (Will Arnett). Things arent looking too good for Susan until Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) comes calling. His goal has something to do with wiping out humanity and repopulating Earth with his own kind - typical megalomaniac space alien stuff. President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert) decides to let loose the monsters in the hope that they and the aliens will eliminate each other. Meanwhile all Susan really wants is to be respected for who she is. Sniff sniff. There was a time when Dreamworks looked like it might be poised to challenge Disney/Pixar for the digital animation throne. That day has long since passed and as Pixar strives to improve with every new feature Dreamworks offers us this. Visually the film is okay but nothing special and certainly nothing on par with WALL-E. The idea seems to be that the presence of 3D eliminates the need to invest effort into striving for the highest quality animation. And this is the real danger of 3D - that the ""wow"" factor becomes so important that other elements are neglected. This is not a movie. Its an amusement park ride. Its a chance for kids to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" while parents catch a nap. Sure the film is sweet and harmless but take away the 3D and all youre left with is a generic kids movie not unlike Madagascar and its sequel (both of which also came from Dreamworks). Monsters vs. Aliens is a gallery of missed opportunities. There are a couple of lame King Kong references a nod to Star Trek and a musical echo of Close Encounters but thats about it. Yet despite the presence of a War Room and a Buck Turgidson-type (named General W.R. Monger and voiced by Jack Bauer) theres not a hint of Dr. Strangelove to be found. Its almost as if someone put the setup in place then forgot the punch line. The 3D is distracting but in this case thats a good thing because it livens things up. But it also indicates that had Monsters vs. Aliens been a good movie it would have worked better in 2D. Katzenberg said he wanted to make 3D an integral part of the movie-going experience but with Monsters vs. Aliens he has provided one of the most gimmicky 3D movies since the resurgence of the format.

Monsters vs. Aliens Directors Rob Letterman Conrad Vernon. Cast Reese Witherspoon Seth Rogen Hugh Laurie Kiefer Sutherland. Rating PG for sci-fi action crude humor and mild language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Qamp;A Reese Witherspoon Sutherland morphs from Jack Bauer to Yosemite Sam Monsters creates another dimension Katzenberg 3-D theaters rollout will quicken Animated movies That may sound like a rather generic requirement but what it means is this If youre a parent whos going to have to watch one of these movies probably more than once you go into it thinking There better be something for me. Thus during ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" when Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (voice of Hugh Laurie) exclaims during an explosion or some other such mayhem ""By Hawkings chair"" the grown-ups can relax. If theyre making offhand references to Stephen Hawking theres something here for us too. Of course ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is aimed at kids who presumably wont mind the thin plot or the disjointed story too much. And frankly the grown-ups probably will be laughing at B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) so much they wont really mind either. Wait you say. Isnt this a Reese Witherspoon movie? And yes to the extent that an animated film can belong to an actor its hers. She plays Susan Murphy a normal woman who on her wedding day is hit by a meteorite; it doesnt crush her but instead turns her into a giant. But if there is a problem with the film its that her story about learning self-worth and to accept oneself and others leaves her as an oversize straight man. Her story just isnt as compelling as the laughs that B.O.B. and the others generate. Susan is set to marry Derek Dietl (Paul Rudd) a local TV weatherman with designs on the anchor chair preferably in a big market. Once Susan explodes in size shes whisked away to a secret government compound and renamed Ginormica. Turns out the military has long kept various monsters under the stern command of Gen. W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland). Susan meets Dr. Cockroach the survivor of an unfortunate accident reminiscent of ""The Fly""; the Missing Link (Will Arnett) a ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" knock-off; and B.O.B. a brainless blob created when scientists accidentally combined a genetically altered tomato and ranch-flavored dessert topping. Theres also Insectosaurus a giant well insect. Because of the hush-hush nature of the government program no one including Derek and Susans family knows where she is. She seems destined for an unhappy life of confinement until an alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) invades the planet. The President (Stephen Colbert) is desperate and enlists Mongers monsters to save the world. More than once even. Thats when the movie begins to drift a bit. There are some good individual scenes particularly when B.O.B. gets hold of alien weapons. Colberts president doesnt live up to expectations (hes much funnier on his Comedy Central show) and the story has a few too many stops and starts. Still if ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" doesnt address (or even attempt to address) larger themes in the way ""WALL-E"" did for instance it has a pretty strong hole card Its really funny for both kids and grown-ups. Besides Rogen Laurie is good as the buggy scientist and Sutherland gets to show a lot more range than he does on ""24"" where his expressions are limited to variations on grimacing. (Although thats sometimes pretty funny too.) When Dr. Cockroach explains to Susan that B.O.B. doesnt have a brain B.O.B. replies ""Turns out you dont need one"" Excellent observation. Dont overthink ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" Just enjoy it. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Movie review Monsters vs Aliens - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Orlando Sentinel Movie review Monsters vs. Aliens -- 4 out of 5 stars A scene from Monsters vs. Aliens Paramount Paramount Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The animation wizards at Dreamworks leave Shrek and Madagascar sequels behind and what do they come up with?A Close Encounters-Independence Day-Clone Wars-Mars Attacks-Monsters Inc -Mothra mashup that is more fun than any movie this derivative has a right to be. Steal from one movie youre a plagiarist. Steal from 20 youre a genius. Monsters vs. Aliens isnt quite ""genius"" but it is a beautifully animated wacky and laugh-out-loud 3D riff on monster movies alien conspiracy and invasion thrillers past and present. Reese Witherspoon is the voice of Susan a pretty young thing prepping for her wedding to up-and-coming Modesto TV weather man Derek ( Paul Rudd). Shes struck by a meteor. Next thing she knows shes glowing. Next thing she knows after that shes growing.And thats when the black helicopters arrive. Susan is nabbed by General W. R. Monger ( Kiefer Sutherland a drawling hoot) and locked in a vast underground government facility where all the ""monsters"" are kept. ""This place is an X-file wrapped in a cover-up and deep fried in a paranoid conspiracy""The other monsters -- a gigantic caterpillar a creature from the Black Lagoon named ""Missing Link"" ""Dr. Cockroach"" and a blob named ""Bob"" are thrilled.""Whats your name? What do people scream when youre coming?"" Bob ( Seth Rogen perfect) wants to know.Ginormica Susans new name is doomed to a life hidden from humanity. Until that is an alien armed with skyscraper-sized robots shows up and menaces the Earth. The president ( Stephen Colbert) is at a loss. Throw the monsters at them promise them freedom if they defeat the four-eyed freak (Rainn Wilson) who threatens to clone himself into an army to conquer the worldThe action scenes are downright thrilling the storytelling is brisk and witty the homages to alien and monster movies funny and affectionate (best Close Encounters spoof ever). Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (and five credited writers) know their B-movies and have fun paying tribute to them in a spectacular brawl on the Golden Gate Bridge for instance.The cast is one-liner friendly. Will Arnett is the game but more scary than strong ""Link"" Hugh Laurie was born to do Dr. Cockroachs mad scientists cackle. And Colbert? Funny in every line.""OK boys go to Terror Condition Brown. Because I need to change my pants""Theres a message here too about not living in someone elses shadow and never knowing what youre capable of until others demand it of you. But this is Dreamworks where the ironic pop tunes pepper the soundtrack the big names do the big voices and the zingers zing.The 3D is pretty much just a gimmick. But then when youre calling your movie Monsters vs. Aliens its all gimmick. Thank heavens its also a lot of fun.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - At the end of 2008 DreamWorks Animation bossman Jeffrey Katzenberg embarked on a cross-country tour toting 20 minutes worth of Monsters vs. Aliens. The reason for his trek? To convince critics that 3-D movies are no longer the snake-oil salesmans hustle but the future of filmmaking--if not the very savior of big-screen cinema. ""Emotionally immersive"" the prophet called it. The Last Word in ""the shared communal experience.""The five-year-old sitting beside me at a preview screening of Monsters vs. Aliens last weekend offered his own endorsement not 10 seconds into the movie--around the time chunks of blown-up planet appeared to land in his lap. ""Whoa Dad"" he said. ""Awesome."" The chorus of children around us agreed as the theater echoed with giggles squeals and the random bleats of adolescent amazement.Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon from a screenplay written by more than half a dozen Monsters vs. Aliens will heretofore be known as the first 3-D movie to genuinely and effectively and astoundingly merge screen and theater actors (well . . .) and audience--its The Purple Rose of Cairo come to life starring a gelatinous blue blob named Bicarbonate Ostylezene Benzoate . . . or B.O.B. It renders all previous comers headache-inducing charlatans rinky-dink pretenders. For the first time in the mediums history you are there--from the presidents war room (shades of Dr. Strangelove) to a prison facility where the governments been storing assorted mutants and monsters collected since the 1950s.Of course such places plot points and predicaments--and the attempt to shove them and a red paddle ball in your face--have been around just as long; Monsters vs. Aliens is a tomorrow very much indebted to movies yesterdays. B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen nearly as genius a move as the 3-D) has slithered out of Irvin Yeaworth Jr.s 1958 Z-grade classic The Blob but this time the blobs a former ripe red tomato injected with ranch-flavored dessert topping thus rendering him a shape-shifting stoner a blissfully self-aware naif with a crush on lime-green Jell-O. Will Arnett voices the Missing Link a defrosted ape-fish known for terrorizing spring breakers on Cocoa Beach back in 1961; only the Link can communicate with Insectosaurus a 350-foot-tall silk-snotting grub whos been exposed to nuclear radiation. The film even comes with its very own version of Vincent Price Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach the mad scientist who sports the noggin of a cockroach and the bwah-haw-haw of his fiendish ancestors.Reese Witherspoon is more or less the films star Susan Murphy of Modesto turned a lovely shade of glowing green by a stray meteorite on the day she was to wed an ambitious weatherman named Derek (Paul Rudd) whos not terribly well-equipped to deal with a suddenly 50-foot-tall fiancee. The egomaniacal Derek looking to make the move to bigger-market Fresno cant live in a shadow that size. Which is just as well Susan is woman hear her roar as Ginormica rounded up by the government and recruited to save the planet from the invading five-eyed blowhard Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson who has turned being a self-aggrandizing blowhard into an art form).Thats the story alien-invasion camp commingled with yet another Dr. Strangelove paranoia parody strictly playbook material. DreamWorks kidult-friendly pop-culture mash-ups--Shrek (as disposable as an episode of Best Week Ever rebroadcast two years later) Bee Movie (nothing more than a way-too-long episode of Seinfeld) and Over the Hedge (admit it you forgot all about that one)--banked the funds that paid for Monsters Ramp;D. They were stepping stones to the mountaintop the ultimate interactive mash-up the cinematic equivalent of what Nintendo offered gamers with the Wii the you-are-there experience.Monsters vs. Aliens was conceived from jump as a 3-D work so every single plot point is tethered to the attendant visual bang--the waves of heat emanating from the militarys attack on a mountainous alien probe; the slabs of concrete falling off the Golden Gate Bridge as it disintegrates into the bay; the armies of clones marching through Gallaxhars cavernous spaceship; the vast spaces of the Area 51 prison which looks as though it reaches back a good half-mile.But children who see the movie on DVD in a few months will wonder what happened to their roller coaster as it morphs into little more than a bumper-car ride. Take away the 3-D and this is significantly more slight than say Madagascar 2 or Kung Fu Panda DreamWorks movies that had to rely more on the clever factor than the wow factor. The chasm between Monsters vs. Aliens technical accomplishment and artistic achievement is vast The storys familiar and as good as the performers are theyre still doing their trademark shtick (though Stephen Colbert as the President is a stroke of casting brilliance). But the grandeur of the effects--the honest-to-God spectacle of the thing--elevates Monsters vs. Aliens to something approaching art. Its not a masterpiece but its most certainly a milestone.

""Monster vs. Aliens"" encapsulates virtually every stereotype about bad videogame movie adaptations in one package. Derivative repetitive and not so much inspired by the DreamWorks toon as a weak attempt to mimic it the game seems built to appeal only to young kids with short attention spans and minimal skills. After the pics boffo opening some tykes might be drawn to the game as a way to relive the film until the DVD release but players of any age looking for an engaging videogame will be sorely disappointed. The ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" film like most DreamWorks Animated features is full of jokes and allusions meant to appeal to adults. But Activisions game has no such pretensions. Within the first 20 minutes there are two belches and a fart. Theres no remotely challenging gameplay as it cruises easily down the path of the movies events. Players alternate among three styles of playing each associated with one of the monsters. Susan (aka Ginormica a fifty-foot tall woman) dons a pair of cars as roller-skates and hurtles down roads and corridors with minimal wriggling room. The Missing Link a cross between an ape and a fish smashes and bashes his way through robot enemies. And B.O.B. a blob gets saddled with the platforming action which includes a few minor puzzle challenges the occasional turret shooting gallery and some moderately clever gravity-bending levels. Theres nothing here that hasnt been done better in numerous other games. When the ""God of War""-style button-pressing sequences in which players just occasionally press buttons while watching a cutscene borrowed from the film appear its clear the developers have run out of ideas. To its credit ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" moves quickly. Though theres not much variety (its probably not a good idea to have one of the characters regularly comment on how repetitive the game is) and its chopped into short alternating segments that might distract a child from noticing he or she is essentially replaying the same bits but with a slightly different background. Game follows the basic outline of the film with a setpiece on the Golden Gate Bridge for instance but none of the particulars. It seems like the developers at Beenox were given a cast of characters a list of locations that had to be visited in order and little else. Unlike the film the humor here is mostly flat. In a clever idea to extend gameplay each character has a ""directors commentary"" -- a set of alternate jokes the player will only hear when replaying a level. There are plenty of unlockables in the ""DNA lab"" which consists of a set of branching paths supposedly resembling a DNA strand (which it absolutely doesnt). Here players are invited to spend their easily earned points unlocking concept art character improvements and levels theyre already played that are repurposed as score-based challenges. The cooperative multiplayer game is based on the system in ""Super Mario Galaxy"" allowing a second player to move a cursor around the screen zapping bad guys. Its a smart way to let very young kids watch and participate without having to learn to play the game proper. Graphics are passable recalling nicely the look and movements of the movie. Most of the movies voice talents are on hand and do solid work including Reese Witherspoon Seth Rogen Will Arnett and Rainn Wilson. Since Hugh Laurie didnt sound so much like Hugh Laurie in the movie the use of a soundalike for his Dr. Cockroach is no great loss.
