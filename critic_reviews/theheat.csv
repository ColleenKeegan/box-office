"Capital Ideas << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous He Is Not a Prospect  Next Napoleon Dynamite Sony Facebook Twitter Print Movies Capital Ideas White House Downs empty head and The Heats big heart by Wesley Morris on June 27 2013 White House Down is terrible. The acting? The effects? The villainy? All bad. The politics are a hot mess. The music sounds as if it flunked out of the Academy for How to Make an Action Movie Sound American. Any image lingered on by the camera for longer than three seconds any bit of dialogue delivered in bold-italics-underline is bound to recur later as a punch line like the painting of the White House inferno of 1814 which inspires the movie to take a break from all the high-tech warcraft to set a simple fire. Yes this is just like Olympus Has Fallen the other Die Hard-in-the-White House movie which opened this March and itself was like a half-dozen other movies. This new one ropes in films like the Taken series and lots of bad television shows. The bad guys in White House Down include the kind of youngish computer hacker who wears windowpane glasses and has a virtual orgasm swiveling around an office chair as a bank of computer screens spew code. He has clearly fallen out of the CSI overflow bin. And if youre old and youre white and youre male youre just a caricature of old white maleness. Youre a Gilbert Stuart painting vandalized with devil horns. Youre Dick Cheney. Youre Mr. Burns. Youre treated the way Hollywood movies always treat Arabs. The president looks like Jamie Foxx. By that I mean Jamie Foxx is playing the president one James Sawyer and hes a gentleman of poise and rectitude. The entire Middle East is contemplating signing his peace accord. But some havent forgiven him for ordering a stealth mission in Iran to look for nuclear weapons that werent there. Some havent forgiven him for looking like Jamie Foxx. It almost doesnt matter why the White House winds up invaded This is a Roland Emmerich film and Emmerich loves trashing stuff. He has trashed outer space. He has trashed the planet three or four times. He has trashed the Stone Age the American Revolution Godzilla movies and Shakespeare. This is his second demolition of the White House and I can only assume that part of the draw to another helping was the opportunity to capitalize on the evolution of special effects (Independence Day now looks like it was made with Popsicle sticks and Elmers Glue) and better access to heavy artillery. Emmerich is a liberal who gleefully avails himself of the vastness of the military industrial complex. So another reason could have been the chance to imagine what it might mean to trash the White House of a black president while the actual president is black and in doing so what it would be like to turn that president into an action hero. The setup for that action is courtesy of James Vanderbilt who ought to be ashamed of himself. Channing Tatum plays John Cale a war hero and Capitol cop stuck on the security detail for the speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). John is up for a Secret Service job. The woman conducting his interview is an old school friend (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who concludes that based on his failed marriage and early exit from college Johns track record for seeing things through is lackluster. His 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) would concur. Tatum has prematurely become a version of Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas men being phased out of relevance. Channing Tatum keeps playing guys who cant get phased in. Thank god for that ominous-looking maintenance crew pretending to be doing work in the presidents screening room. They strike while John and Emily are on a White House tour. John flees his hostage scenario to find Emily only to happen upon President Sawyer being held at gunpoint. He rescues the president and a buddy comedy follows in which Foxx gets to lower Sawyers upstanding mask and do some code-switching for the audience. When he runs around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in a pair of Air Jordans its not unlike Barack Obama singing ""Lets Stay Together"" before a fund-raiser at the Apollo Theater. Its both men saying ""Dont let the address fool you. Im still down."" Foxx stays within Obamas lines. Theyre black presidents not jive ones. He bends the part without breaking it. I dont know that hes presidential (I found myself wondering whether Id have voted for him) but hes got gravitas and tastefulness. Anyway Foxx and Tatum have a few comedic moments in which the ex-soldier cant believe the commander-in-chief lacks firearms prowess. Their merry ludicrousness is interrupted by a lot of dumb ludicrousness. Occasionally it involves Jenkins Gyllenhaal and Lance Reddick as the head of the joint chiefs bickering in an underground command center. Nearly always it involves Emily. Conveniently shes a spunky know-it-all with a major in urgently uploading video and a concentration in American history and current affairs. She remains imperiled often enough to keep her father and the president from driving right off the White House lawn. (How is this the daughter Channing Tatum has? He doesnt even seem to believe it.) Every time Emily says the words ""you"" or ""tube"" I want to shoot her which makes me more heartless than the terrorists since this is the sort of movie where the baddies can bring themselves to kill just about everybody but her. But the character is here to make a point. Amid so much cowardliness and backstabbing and retirement (a sparkle cake is wheeled out for James Woods who plays Gyllenhaals boss) amid so much cynicism (much of it belonging to Emmerich who luxuriates in oblivion while whispering for peace) this annoying little white girl is here to champion her embattled black president to run out on the White House lawn and put her flag-waving prowess to life-saving use to say ""I love my big old dysfunctional government"" As I said this is a terrible movie. But at least its a timely kind of terrible. The night I saw White House Down the audience laughed at most of it the way you would at a sitcom. Well the way a studio audience would laugh at a sitcom. OK the way a recording of a studio audience would laugh at a sitcom. I actually turned around to see whether the laughter wasnt being pumped into the theater. People laughed just as hard during The Heat. There I didnt bother to turn around because I was laughing too. What movies are missing right now is the kind of performance from an established persona that pushes a star off the deep end. We havent had that since Denzel Washington last year in Flight. So the sight of say Sandra Bullock pulling herself along the floor of a hospital because her legs have gone numb is a stupid but heavenly image. Bullocks comedy has always been about humiliation (shes the antonym of Julia Roberts) and by the time shes down on her stomach in The Heat theres nowhere lower for her to go. That moment is funny because her character a haughty uptight FBI climber is giving everything she has to stop a murder and Bullock a movie star in middle age is giving even more to us. The director Paul Feig who also did Bridesmaids lets the shot go on long enough for her determination and physical desperation to turn absurd. She. Really. Wants. To. Catch. The. Bad. Guys. This is no Bridesmaids. Its an action-comedy to which Katie Dippold has given some emotional warmth but theres very little in it thats special or new. Bullocks FBI agent Sarah Ashburn has come to Boston looking to bust up a drug ring and winds up clashing with a local cop named Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) whos got a personal connection to the case. My skepticism going in had to do with The Heat being a movie with two female characters that easily could have been played by a pair of men. But these two are like workplace sexisms toxic side effects. Ashburn is the ambitious professional who lives only for promotions. Mullins is the anti-feminine ballbuster. Nobody likes either of them. And they dont like each other until they do. This is generic genre stuff with a realish female friendship at its center Its a bra-mance. Some of it is also tired. Mullins has a family in East Boston that resents her for sending her brother (Michael Rapaport) to prison. When he gets mixed up in Ashburns investigation the scenes at the Mullins house give a lot of actors from that part of the world -- Jane Curtin Joey McIntyre Nate Corddry Bill Burr Jessica Chaffin -- a chance to take their accents for a walk. Its cheaply funny opportunism. But were not laughing at the characterization. Were laughing at the accents. Most of the movie is spitballing its laughs. Lest the emotions growing between Ashburn and Mullins put certain dudes off Dippold -- or someone -- has added a scene in which a homemade tracheostomy covers Bullock and McCarthy in blood and another in which Bullock is stabbed with a knife. That second moment does lead to the hospital floor but there had to be a better way of getting there. Despite the nonsense McCarthy and Bullock make sense in physical and temperamental opposition to each other. Im not a big fan of McCarthy tirades but here she embodies a completely realized character and not the crapshoot sketch-comedy acting that some movies allow her to get away with. McCarthys an actress who needs a foil and for now Bullock is more than good enough. I just wish these two had found each other 10 years ago.

"The Heat - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Heat Posted by Christy Lemire on June 28 2013 Leave a Comment 20th Century Fox Rated R for pervasive language strong crude content and some violence. Running time 117 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. Theres a running joke throughout ""The Heat"" in which love-struck men approach Melissa McCarthys foul-mouthed detective character and beg to know why she hasnt called them after she slept with them. They whine. They plead. They open their hearts and make themselves vulnerable to her in ways that are so awkward and sad you almost cant watch them head on - you almost have to peep at them through a pinhole in a shoebox. She rebuffs them - politely - every time. Its just one gag but its a beautiful reflection of the way ""The Heat"" takes film conventions turns them on their head and reinvents them.  Part of the joke is that this is a reversal of traditional (and archaic) gender roles. But another crucial element is the fact that McCarthy as a full-figured brash Boston bad-ass wouldnt necessarily seem like a heartbreaker. But she is - and she owns it. She owns the whole movie actually this mismatched-buddy cop comedy in which she and Sandra Bullock inhabit the roles typically reserved for men especially in the 1980s. Director Paul Feig whose ""Bridesmaids"" upended notions of what a raunchy ensemble comedy could be does it again here with another genre. McCarthy who emerged as a star from that 2011 smash hit (and received a supporting-actress Oscar nomination in the process) clearly had free rein to play here to flex her improv muscles. But the first produced script from Katie Dippold gives her a smart inspired and wickedly funny foundation from which to work and she and Bullock enjoy gangbusters chemistry with each other. Bullock is an expert physical comedian; say what you will about the ""Miss Congeniality"" movies she gives it her all in them. Here she plays the straight woman - the uptight FBI agent forced to team up with McCarthys wild card - and not only does she get the slapstick right but she also finds the sadness and loneliness that make her character such a misfit. The two are stuck working together on a ... does it really matter? The investigation has something to do with a bringing down a drug lord.  From a narrative perspective ""The Heat"" is pure formula and it knows it and it knows that you know it too. What matters here is the way in which it explores and refreshes the standard details and beats of the genre. Bullocks Special Agent Sarah Ashburn is exceedingly competent and eager to please but cant help alienating everyone around her. Shes the smartest person in the room at all times and cant stop herself from letting everyone else know that too. Shes up for a promotion but her boss (Oscar nominee Demian Bichir from ""A Better Life"") is reluctant to give it to her. McCarthys Det. Shannon Mullins is also excellent at her job and also has a way of alienating people. That includes her family a collection of bickering blue-collar boors with wicked hardcore Southie accents. (Joey McIntyre is among them just to ensure authenticity.) When Sarah accompanies Shannon to her childhood home and cant understand a word theyre saying its a bit that shouldnt be funny because its been done so many times. And yet like so many other gags in ""The Heat"" it has an energy about it that makes it work. Shannon is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Sarah in terms of temperament (and hygiene) but has a similar sense of superiority and a similar emotional detachment. Do you think its possible that these two women will not only learn to work together but become friends and actually change each other for the better? The destination was predetermined long ago; the journey there is riotously funny.

The Heat is not the knock-out-it-out-of-the-park summer comedy youd hope for from two of the Bridesmaids dream team (director Paul Feig and actress Melissa McCarthy). A female buddy cop comedy McCarthy stars with Sandra Bullock as an odd-couple crime-fighting duo. You wouldnt think of pairing them in a million years but theyre a riot together. Bullock is a control-freak FBI agent whose colleagues cant stand her. (Kudos to the script for touching on sexism No wonder shes single sneers a male colleague.) McCarthy is a local detective who dresses like a homeless biker. Predictably when they join forces to take down a drug baron they hate each other. If youve never seen the point of Sandra Bullock watch this. Youve got to love how up she is for looking ridiculous playing comedy fall guy to McCarthy - whos back with more of the genius sweary oddball rants she gave us in Bridesmaids. But too much here feels like the usual unfunny unoriginal Lethal Weapon formula. And one sub-grossout scenario involving a DIY tracheotomy is dead on arrival. A couple of killer scenes just about outweigh the laziness. Best of all is McCarthys arrest by watermelon - one of the funniest things Ive seen on screen all summer.

The men in this movie were all weak evil or grossly incompetent. The anti-male vibe was obviuos 15 minutes into the movie and never let up. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 3 2013Daisy CrispFeaturedWhen Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) - aka- the socially-awkward -smart-alec FBI agent and bolshie Boston cop Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) are unceremoniously thrust together they -obviously- clash. Ordered to work together to take down a dangerous drug lord the crime fighting females come to blows with Mullinss almighty bombast bulldozing Ashburns by-the book approach at every turn. Yet as predicted they prove to be the perfect comedic pairing. True both women step into familiar character roles as if slipping into old pair of slippers but hey- you know what they say- if it aint broke... So prepare for a Bridesmaids meets Miss Congeniality mash up -with a smattering of Marmite- (likelihood is youll either be a lover or a hater) and lock and load The 80s buddy-cop movie homage is more of an excuse to milk laughs than it is a revolutionary gender bender statement. Although The Heat does make its acknowledgements with a running theme of misogyny throughout; a half cut Ashburn sighs the forbidden words- Its hard being a woman in the field. Whats more our hilarious heroines operate in a world where a mans arrogance continues to contribute to charisma while female arrogance is nothing short of repulsive. Endless rounds of cracking zingers are fired during the 117 minute war of words with no sign of a ceasefire. But there are no words to explain this bizarrely brilliant laugh -out- loud fest. With enough side-splitting scenes to warrant a salute The Heat is an unapologetic hot mess in all the right ways.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> There are only two reasons to see The Heat. But they are formidable reasons and they go by the names of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. They play cops. Bullock is Sarah Ashburn a socially inept FBI ramrod with her eye on a bigger job. McCarthy is Shannon Mullins a battering ram of ball-busting fire who makes life hell in the Boston PD for anyone who gets in her way. Of course Sarah sticks in her craw. Of course the two will eventually bond. Of course Bridesmaids director Paul Feig will put a shine on every cliche in the R-rated cop comedy book. The subtext in the all-over-the-place script by Katie Dippold is that women can behave just as boorishly as guys. Point taken but that point gets tired very quickly. What does work is the hilarious interplay between the two stars. Learning that the irritating Sarah was once married Shannon deadpans ""Was he a hearing man?"" McCarthy is a force of comic nature. And she and Bullock mix it up like pros. In this dead-battery of a movie these live-wires miraculously ignite sparks.

Thats not meant sarcastically Its one of the highlights of this often dismal but occasionally inspired comedy from Paul Feig director of Bridesmaids which pits Bullocks hoity-toity FBI agent against a brassy Boston cop played by Melissa McCarthy. The two are thrown together in pursuit of an elusive drug lord and much of the movie -- too much of it -- is spent testing the boundaries of how loud and obnoxious McCarthy can be. Feig doesnt hand this able comic actress the gift of freedom; he simply gives her enough rope which isnt nearly the same thing. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But The Heat has a spark of something irregularly ignited by the unlikely kinship between these two actresses. Bullocks Special Agent Ashburn and McCarthys Detective Mullins both have an attitude problem Ashburn comes off as a know-it-all who alienates the men in her department (even though she does know it all much better than they do). And Mullins doesnt give a rats butt for anyone else Told her boss is looking for her she snaps ""Tell him Ill be there at sharply go-fuck-yourself oclock.""One of The Heats failures is the way it attempts feebly to say something serious about the ways women are treated in the workplace. The suggestion is that both Ashburn and Mullins know exactly what theyre doing but dont get the respect (and most likely the salary) they deserve. On the other hand these two are hell to work with and being movie characters they need to discover their inner vulnerabilities before they can become truly good at what they do. Snore. In the end The Heat like Bridesmaids before it has to be about feelings. Thats often true of male buddy pictures too but The Heat could have come up with something better than its ""Gee Officer Krupke""-style ""Im depraved on account of Im deprived"" explanation for why these women cant work and play well with others.Film Details The Heat RatingR GenreComedy Running Time117 More Info Trailer Yet Bullock and McCarthy work and play well together which is what counts. Its possible that McCarthy and the directors who work with her believe that because shes big everything she does has to be outsized. In The Heat that translates to lots of insults and scatological retorts all delivered at decibel levels suitable for deaf dogs. But McCarthys at her best with the subtle reaction shot or winding her way toward a slow-burning zinger. At times she and Bullock tease out the best in each other. Bullock cedes everything to McCarthy She knows she cant make a bigger noise than her overbearing co-star so she bobs and weaves between the lines instead. This is accord as chemistry and it works.You can see it best in the peanut-snorting scene where Bullock very obviously -- and almost unsuccessfully -- tries not to let McCarthy crack her up. That tension and the release of it makes the moment glorious. It also highlights a key angle of McCarthys gifts as a comic actress She sops up all the embarrassment around her freeing anyone else onscreen with her from looking totally ridiculous which is its own kind of generosity.

(Associated Press/20th Century Fox) Sandra Bullock left and Melissa McCarthy play mismatched cops chasing a drug dealer in South Boston.(Associated Press/20th Century Fox) REVIEW The Heat There was a funnier way to do this Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 28 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 28 2013 934AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul Feig Written by Katie Lippold Starring Sandra Bullock Melissa McCarthy Classification 14A Genre comedy Year 2013 Country USA Language English Ho-hum you got the earnest straight-laced by-the-book cop which surely means you must also have the loose-cannon foul-mouthed off-the-wall cop. Do the math and if this were funny The Heat would add up to your average buddy-cop comedy. Except that its not funny at least not very and not often. So thats one difference. Another is that the mismatched buds are females this time - Sandra Bullock slim in her neat grey suit and Melissa McCarthy less slim in her sloppy grey sweats. Bonus points for guessing who plays which cop. McCarthy is reunited with director Paul Feig of Bridesmaids fame also a girl bonding flick but ranking considerably higher on the laugh-meter. So whats the trouble on this go-round? Well at the risk of seeming untactful weight is definitely an issue The script has blimped up to a running time of nearly two hours a corpulence thats never a good sign in the comedy biz. Humour almost invariably needs a leaner faster profile. By contrast this thing dawdles and meanders and lacks any sense of pacing. The lines have no punch; at best they paw. Worse much of the scripted flab can be blamed on sheer repetition - a one-note conceit huffing and puffing and puffing and huffing until the joke gets really tired. Thats about 10 minutes in and there are miles to go before it sleeps. Happily we arent similarly constrained.The milieu is South Boston where Bullocks Sarah is the interloper a stern FBI agent possessed of lacquered hair a poker up her butt a career without flaws and a life without friends. Raised in foster homes and over-compensating ever since she lives alone with a cat - actually her neighbours cat. Of course charged with the task of removing said poker from said butt is McCarthys Shannon who patrols a beat in her deadbeat duds. Before her constant barrage of four-letter words two-legged perps crumble like stale cookies in the bargain bin. Her many amorous conquests do likewise regularly popping up to beg for another ample roll in the hay. Self-assured sexually accomplished the quickest of first-responders shes a one-woman Boston Strong. Which is where the picture goes badly wrong with McCarthy but more about that later.In the meantime obliged to team together in quest of some drug kingpin or other the pair mosey along from inflated set-piece to inflated set-piece. The bickering arrives early tailor-made for the fairer sex. One cop points ""Your breast is invading my space."" The other retorts ""Keep your finger off of my areola."" Then comes the repetition like the redundant interrogation-room scenes. One cop applies psychology straight from the Agency handbook; the other applies her gun straight to the suspects crotch. The colloquy continues on the dance floor of antic clubs on the beer-stained stools of seedy bars in speeding cars and in the villains den until Ms. Straight-Lace learns to unbutton (literally) and to admit to her vulnerabilities.Which brings us back to the pictures problem. Its not just that the principals gifted comedians both are working without any consistently amusing dialogue - screen history is strewn with gifted comedians expected to labour under that tiny handicap. Instead theyre cast in the wrong roles here. It would have been much funnier and richer to reverse the characters - slim plays loose-cannon confidence less slim plays by-the-book insecurities. Why? Because McCarthys over-sized persona requires what Bullock doesnt - an element of vulnerability to bring our her full comedic potential. Bridesmaids gave her a little and Identify Thief enough that in a brief yet memorable sequence she got to dig beneath her trademark mania to show off some seriously good acting chops.Girth and comedy are worthy companions and a fascinating topic a buddy story in itself. Many men - Fields Hardy Gleason Candy - have combined the two but few women. To her great credit McCarthy does so with such assurance that her size becomes the benign elephant in the room - rarely spoken of and certainly conquered but still very much there an essential component of her comic shtick. Essential because shes at her funniest when the courage of that conquest is there too when the sense of frailties confronted and forces overcome is also part of the shtick. This is a tepid comedy for many reasons but not least for depriving Melissa McCarthy of her vulnerability and thus of her courage - that is The Heat takes from a hilarious woman precisely what makes her so tantalizingly hot.

Nothing quite says female empowerment like violating the civil rights of criminal suspects am I right? Stop-and-frisk racial profiling harsh interrogation and enforcing the ludicrous laws of the drug war - such are the frontiers of feminism explored in ""The Heat"" this weekends buddy comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy as a zany pair of mismatched cops. I know I know Im being a killjoy and deliberately missing the point of the raunchy new woman-centric romp from ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig with a screenplay by ""Parks and Recreation"" writer Katie Dippold.Well lets talk about that shall we? What is the point of making a movie thats just like the dopiest broadest and most reductive grade of guy-oriented comedy except with women? With ""Bridesmaids"" I could more or less understand why many women I respected seized on the films release as a feminist moment and really wanted it to be a hit. (I still didnt think it was all that great; Leslye Headlands much-maligned ""Bachelorette"" was meaner smarter and funnier.) If Judd Apatow-style hard-R bodily-function comedy was where the money was in Hollywood then the ladies should get to slice some of that cheese on their own terms and opening up space for female writers directors and producers to do their work with bigger budgets could only be a good thing.To root for ""The Heat"" as a feminist breakthrough you have to reiterate all the same arguments with the proviso that this is a much less interesting and original film - basically a hit-and-miss sketch comedy with some decent laughs but not much plot - trying to reclaim a historically moronic genre that makes the wedding farce look like Shakespeare. (Come to think of it a lot of Shakespeare is wedding farce.) The most interesting aspects of ""The Heat"" are its metadata you might say Both lead actresses are over 40 (Bullock will turn 50 next year) suggesting that Hollywoods ironclad rules about female age are beginning to crumble; McCarthy continues to open possibilities for larger women as movie protagonists rather than figures of fun (and this is a much better setting for her than the execrable ""Identity Thief""); this could be the opening shot in a volley of female buddy movies with sexual or romantic subplots relegated to the background.I salute ""The Heat"" on all those fronts. But this is a movie not a PowerPoint presentation by San Diego State professor Martha Lauzen the intrepid watchdog of sex and gender in Hollywood. And as a movie its a mixed-up and frequently uncomfortable experience. Im pretty sure that Feig and Dippold have no ideological intentions when it comes to their depiction of crime and police work; theyre only thinking about the conventions of the cop movie. But those conventions are ideological not to mention inherently reactionary so we get what is meant to be an endearing comedy about two prickly loner career women who have internalized the vicious macho culture of police work. Theyre very different models of adult womanhood who join forces -- to borrow the vernacular of Shannon Mullins the tough Boston street cop played by McCarthy - to cock-block the Fourth Amendment. You Might Also Like Theres an edgy but rewarding chemistry between Bullock and McCarthy that makes me wish they were attached to a less foul-tasting premise. Dippolds script delivers numerous zingers largely in the form of foulmouthed irascible ranting from Mullins who leaves her fellow cops the criminal class her ex-lovers and the rest of Bostons male population trembling in fear. Bullocks character Sarah Ashburn is a bit more central-casting Shes a divorced seemingly sexless and relentlessly driven FBI agent who wears dreadful pantsuits and doesnt recognize that shes universally hated. (When Ashburn tells Mullins she used to be married the latter pauses a beat and then asks ""Was he a hearing man?"") It may almost be worth the price of admission to hear Bullock utter the line (in response to an extended allegorical insult about her lack of sexuality) ""Thats a misrepresentation of my vagina."" When these two are just antagonizing each other alienating other officials from numerous law enforcement agencies getting hammered in the inevitable dive-bar sequence or tangling with Mullins cartoonish Irish-American family ""The Heat"" can be highly agreeable in loose-limbed pointless fashion. One could definitely make a version of this movie that pushed in a mildly transgressive direction by not having Ashburn and Mullins run down a low-level drug dealer with a car repeatedly threaten to shoot detainees in the crotch and finally drop an unarmed suspect off a building for no particular reason. (Then theres the remarkably ill-considered moment when Mullins responds to accusations of racist conduct by claiming that nine out of 10 guys she sleeps with are black as if that were actually an answer.)You could steer away from depicting gross misconduct as funny or you could make those things - along with the movies drug-war setting and surprisingly high body count - mean something by introducing a little dramatic weight. Instead Dippolds screenplay seems driven by a confused machismo as if she feels the need to assert that women on the screen behind the camera and in the audience can be just as morally reckless as men. Well OK they can The victories of progress come in all shapes and sizes but I have to say this one is really really small. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

At area theaters. Laughter can be magical. It can also be crass. In the formidable person of Melissa McCarthy it is typically both. And no director seems to know what to do with that tension quite like Paul Feig. You only need to have seen Seth Gordons powerfully unfunny comedy ""Identity Thief"" -- which tried to exploit that McCarthy je ne sais quoi -- to believe that the director really did have a hand in the hilarity of ""Bridesmaids"" the 2011 hit that brought the comedian to a vast audience. Now Fieg has directed McCarthy in the cop buddy flick ""The Heat."" And the star is once again painfully funny and profane sweet and appalling. She portrays rude righteous Boston detective Shannon Mullins who likes to go it alone. Shes even on the outs with her family (Jane Curtin plays her bitter mom with a downturned grimace) thanks to her zeal. Not a half-bad comedian herself Sandra Bullock has top billing as FBI agent Sarah Ashburn. Her crime-solving instincts are uncanny. Her colleague skills are dismal. With her boss (Demian Bichar wasted in the role) headed up the ladder Ashburn hopes for his job. She leaves New York for Boston to hunt down a mysterious drug lord. If successful maybe she has a shot at the promotion. All she has to do is work with Mullins. Penned by big-screen newbie Katie Dippold the crime story that pairs the crime stoppers is more broth than chowder. But the chemistry between the stars and their at-odds characters is the real deal. Bullock is deft at switching from goofball to straightman depending on whats required of a scene. Part of McCarthys appeal comes from her and Feigs teasing of seeming contradictions. Shes big -- yes we worry for her health -- but physically nimble or just plain fearless. (Did you see that ridiculous ham dance skit when she hosted ""Saturday Night Live""?) Her verbal reflexes are even more fleet. And finally its a given she has an appetite for getting it on. McCarthys characters since ""Bridesmaids"" rebut whatever notions some audience members might harbor that having sex and being very overweight are mutually exclusive. Although there are some physical gags the best laughs are embedded in the duos repartee or McCarthys incredibly quick toss-off lines. I laughed consistently heartily naughtily. The use of the Isley Brothers hit ""Fight the Power"" at the movies start should have earned an extra half star. And theres a bit of random (but appreciated by this late boomer critic) referencing of the Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn hit ""Foul Play."" So why the slightly wan star rating? Because as fine a McCarthy mixologist as Feig is this cocktail of two parts immense talent to one part slight story craft is not sustainable. Sure McCarthy deserves better but so do we. Its easy to imagine agent Ashburn and officer Mullins teaming up again in the none-too-distant future. If they do -- and Im all for a reunion -- lets hope they have adversaries worthy of their crime-solving and wise-cracking odd couple.

A little of McCarthys bullishness goes a long way - ditto Bullocks pinched uncomfortability.Its not really such a great achievement to have women cops in the movies acting as boorish and rowdy as their male counterparts especially since the movie seems designed for a sequel. But then again what movie these days - or at least this summer - isnt? Grade C+ (Rated R for pervasive language strong crude content and some violence.)

Gemma La Mana/Fox The Heat Director Paul Feig Genre Action Comedy Crime Running Time 117 minutes Rated R for pervasive language strong crude content and some violence With Sandra Bullock Melissa McCarthy Demian Bichir (Recommended) In a summer movie season thats been light with women in major roles a Melissa McCarthy-Sandra Bullock buddy-cop comedy sounds like a welcome change of pace. Add in the fact that this movie is Paul Feigs follow-up to Bridesmaids and you have something especially interesting. Watch Clips From The Heat - And You Will Be Patient? And You Will Be Patient? Credit Fox From The Heat - I Think You And I Got Off On The Wrong Foot I Think You And I Got Off On The Wrong Foot Credit Fox From The Heat - The Rats Back In The House The Rats Back In The House Credit Fox Well not to overstate things but every other comedy this summer had better watch out. Because The Heat? Is on. Paying homage to its genre roots The Heat opens with a bouncy 70s-cop-show credit sequence and follows it by twice mastering the vanishing art of the efficient character introduction; in just a few short minutes it proves itself as deft as even the likes of Lethal Weapon at nailing down exactly who these two wildly different characters are. Bullock plays FBI agent Sarah Ashburn a straitlaced professional who schools every other agent at the scene of a drug bust and is the only one surprised when her boss (Demian Bichir) delays a possible promotion pointing out that basically no one likes her. Good at her job to the point of arrogance Ashburn needs to prove she can play well with others so shes sent to Boston to work a case involving a drug cartel run by a shadowy figure known only as Larkin. McCarthys introduction as Boston detective Shannon Mullins is bigger and louder involves both the unorthodox arrest of a john (Tony Hale one of quite a few comedic talents in the movie) and the pursuit of a small-time dealer named Rojas (actor-comic Spoken Reasons) whos got a possible connection to Larkin. Theres a manic joy in Mullins eye as she pursues Rojas in her junker of a car -- while he runs from her on foot. In short while Ashburn takes pride in a by-the-book job Mullins just loves catching bad guys -- and she does it well book be damned. You can imagine how much she enjoys learning that the FBI in the tight-lipped person of Ashburn is muscling in on her case. Thats that for the basic setup of the average odd-couple buddy-cop actioner and The Heat follows the genres basic formula from combustible conflict through mutual respect and on to eventual friendship -- only it tops pretty much every beat in that familiar plot outline with memorably ludicrous gags. Ask Me Another Paul Feig Le Geek Cest Chic Writer Katie Dippold doesnt rest on the broad strokes of Ashburn and Mullins contrasting personalities instead going further to mine how differently they dress think and speak for comedy. (Ashburn more than once confuses Mullins for long-haired bearded men though given the cheerful slovenliness of McCarthys characterization its an almost understandable mistake.) The one thing they do share -- a keen sense of competition -- results in a surprising (and welcome) number of physical-comedy bits large and small; witness a scene in which they each try their own approach to interrogation or the small moment where they both try to make it into a suspects building at once. McCarthy and Bullocks divergent comedy styles are so suited to their respective characters that they could easily expand a Heat franchise to star in their own solo vehicles. Unlike McCarthys role in the forgettable Identity Thief earlier this year Mullins allows McCarthy to confidently flex all of her weird comedy muscles whether shes verbally emasculating her precinct captain or finding another reason to draw her gun. (Mullins might be the most reckless movie cop in recent memory when it comes to firearms.) Bullocks style is more technical but shes more than game to play and their mutual generosity as performers makes for a gratifying chemistry that amplifies the already smartly written jokes. When McCarthy and Bullock start downing shots in an epic drinking sequence remember that youre watching an Oscar nominee and an Oscar winner -- and yes theyre performing at the top of their game. The plot is structured to facilitate bits like these and if the movie were merely a vehicle conceived to let its stars bicker bond and kick endless quantities of ass it would be enough. But The Heat goes above and beyond managing to sneak in an emotional core. Mullins cares about protecting her neighborhood and family including her brother Jason (Michael Rapaport) whos recently out of prison and may have another link to Larkin. And as Ashburn and Mullins increasingly encounter real danger in the pursuit of their target Feig makes the challenge of balancing side-by-side sentiment and irreverence look easy. If The Heat is about more than being a well-oiled delivery system for impressive and effective comedy its in part about what it means to be a good cop -- including the question of how gender does or doesnt factor into that. The challenges of being a female Five-0 on a male-dominated force are implicit from the beginning but theyre made plainer still when Mullins and Ashburn encounter a rival pair of DEA agents one apparently harmless but the other a blatant sexist who wants the ladies off the case. Spoiler alert It doesnt happen. The Heat come they conquer and they leave you laughing.

The others a by-the-book federal agent who keeps a sharp crease in her suits and her eye on the regulations. Can two law officers share a high-profile drug case without driving each other crazy? Yes theres a bit of every buddy cop movie youve ever seen in ""The Heat."" Also not a small hint of ""The Odd Couple."" And a whole lot of two actresses playing to type. The plot has Sandra Bullock as the uptight FBI agent going to Boston to hunt down a narcotics trafficker (and butter up her boss for a promotion). Melissa McCarthy is the detective on the other end a proud Boston brawler who has a personal interest in the case. Most movies get a lot more interesting when people resist typecasting and its diverting to imagine what this would have been like if McCarthy played the genteel Fed and Bullock the down-and-dirty cop. Diverting -- but probably unprofitable in every sense. Bullocks role is the more thankless one -- and honestly the more tired -- but its hard to see her managing McCarthys. And McCarthys just terrific with these kinds of characters -- loud proud and in-your-face usually with profanities so inventive they take a while to sink in. A small controversy arose during her last film ""Identity Thief"" when a critic used his review to lambaste McCarthy calling her ""obese and obnoxious""; later he walked it back a bit saying he was actually criticizing how movies consistently turned fat people into cheap clowns. McCarthy herself though is nobodys fool onscreen or off. Yes shes large -- but shes in charge too. The women she plays are smart funny and physically strong. They give as good as they get in the insult department and theyre rarely lacking for male companionship. Like most comedies though ""The Heat"" could use well a little more comedy. Bullocks character isnt very fresh (and has anyone ever really believed her as a woman who cant get a date?). The crime part of the story is handled perfunctorily at best. The script from Freeholds Katie Dippold also indulges a little too frequently in offensive or racist jokes -- and then tries to get away with it by having someone complain ""Thats so racist"" Its a bit of a dodge -- trying to have its slurs and its PC badge too. But director Paul Feig (who also helmed ""Bridesmaids"") clearly enjoys the spectacle of women behaving badly and gives his stars -- and particularly McCarthy -- plenty of room and improv time to knock back shots bust a move and beat up men until they squeal like little girls. And if the film takes a little too long to wrap itself up -- and then hints a little too predictably at a sequel -- the funky soundtrack is fun and McCarthys South Boston relations are a scream. And if McCarthy gets plenty of laughs throughout its only because shes laughing first. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and drug and alcohol abuse. The Heat (R) Fox (117 min.)

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it With Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy as odd-couple police detectives how could you go wrong right? Somehow the makers of ""The Heat"" figured out a way. (Gemma La Mana) By Ann Hornaday June 27 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The team-up of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy looks on paper to be a sure-fire formula for comic gold; both gifted comediennes they also possess temperaments and physical packages diametrically opposed enough to recreate the kind of comedy made famous by such duos as Abbott and Costello or Jackie Gleason and Art Carney. In ""The Heat"" they play mismatched law enforcement officers who bicker and bumble their way into solving a crime and finding a friend. The conceit of the film which was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Paul Feig -- who directed McCarthy to sudden stardom in ""Bridesmaids"" -- is that for all their differences both share an essential loneliness that has kept them isolated and miserable. That sad subtext gives much of the humor in ""The Heat"" a melancholy edge especially when it comes to McCarthy who once again is forced into a role that asks little more of her than swearing like a stevedore and subjecting herself to undignified slapstick centered around her generous figure. (An early bit has her crashing over a fence while shes pursuing a young lithe perpetrator; a few moments later shes trying to get out of a car wedged into a tight parking space finally wriggling over a series of front seats like an ungainly eel.) Bullock plays McCarthys opposite number uptight put-together and prim so you know going in that ""The Heat"" will feature at least one drunken girl-bonding montage which in this case arrives almost as a random perfunctory insert. Earlier when they try to bug the phone of a suspect in a disco Feig films the action so closeup that the scenes rich wealth of physical comedy is almost completely squandered. Seen through one lens ""The Heat"" is the product of a cheering trend in female-centered comedies a feminist sister under the skin to ""Bridesmaids."" Seen through another it revolves around the retrograde novelty of watching women swagger spout vulgarities brandish guns and toss around references to their vaginas (not to mention the odd areola and cervix). Like Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx in ""White House Down"" Bullock and McCarthy and the chemistry they generate are far more compelling than the movie theyre in. Too often the sketches go on too long and the coarse abrasive tone quickly begins to feel repetitive and off-putting. Theres already talk of a sequel to ""The Heat"" which is good news if only to introduce some refreshing gender balance to the current franchise-movie monoculture. Give these ladies a genuinely smart funny script -- and give McCarthy more to play than what has become a tiresome tomboy shtick -- and theres no telling what liberated heights they can reach. 1/2 R.

RELATED NEWS Essential Sandra Bullock movies Speed to Blind Side By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jun 27 2013 601 PM On his last directorial outing Paul Feig steered potty-mouthed comedy ""Bridesmaids"" to a nearly 300 million gross and a surprise Oscar nomination for breakout star Melissa McCarthy (while inspiring a slew of think pieces about how golly women can be funny after all). With those two talents teamed up again its disappointing that ""The Heat"" doesnt do more than take an established film template -- in this case the buddy-cop flick -- throw in a Tarantino-size helping of F-bombs cast a couple of women and call it a day. Sandra Bullock stars as FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn the yin to Melissa McCarthys yang as Boston cop Shannon Mullins. You know the drill Ashburn is a fussy slave to procedure; Mullins is a slovenly loose cannon. Ashburn wears Spanx; Mullins wears sweatpants. Rinse repeat. On the prowl for a job promotion Ashburn takes a gig in Boston hunting down a mysterious drug lord. There shes teamed up with Mullins a crude cop with a fridge full of ammo whose contacts (and general bravado) prove indispensable to solving the case. They cant stand each other but they need each other. Its as formulaic as these things get to the point where the film cant even feign much interest in its own unnecessarily muddled plot. In fact its only attempt at originality seems to have been in casting a pair of women instead of men in the lead roles -- which would be heaps more insulting if theyd cast anybody other than McCarthy. Shes not infrequently hilarious wringing profane humor out of easy jokes that wouldve fallen flat without her charisma. And though the film shouldnt be awarded bonus points for being decent toward McCarthy its a relief not to see her used as the punch line of any lazy fat jokes (especially after the nightmare that was ""Identity Thief""). Bullocks character provides less opportunity for crude humor -- were talking about a woman so uptight and expletive-averse she says things like ""You wanna see some bull feces?"" -- and her spinster cat-lady shtick is less endearing. Shes essentially playing a riff on her ""Miss Congeniality"" character yet another unfeminine FBI agent who blossoms when shes forced outside her comfort zone. Shes a funny woman and she does what she can with the material but she all but disappears in the glow of whatever wanton magic McCarthy is working. A sprawling unfocused script from writer Katie Dippold is partially to blame. Her television pedigree lends itself more to improvisation (she has loads of ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""MADtv"" writing credits) and her talent for episodic and sketch comedy doesnt translate to a two-hour feature film. Scenes go on too long. Jokes outwear their welcome. The plot though perfunctory (its no more complex or intriguing than the average hourlong television crime procedural) gets muddled. Even though McCarthy keeps the laughs coming ""The Heat"" doesnt really pack enough. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Grade C- Nice and smart gals finish last. Thats the underlying message of the execrable female buddy farce ""The Heat."" Sandra Bullock plays 12-year FBI veteran Sarah Ashburn an uptight Yalie who learns how to cuss and swagger from a slovenly idiosyncratic Boston cop Shannon Mullins played by Melissa McCarthy. Its a slob comedy that goes with crippling speed from smart to dumb and then from dumber to dumbest. Director Paul Feig says he was inspired partly by action-filled laugh riots like ""48 Hrs."" Besides all the other things ""The Heat"" lacks compared to that movie - including excitement and good pungent gutter humor - it falls astonishingly short in the odd-couple chemistry department. There are few scenes of persuasive bonding and even fewer that portray 50-50 collaborations on fighting crime. Thats just sad - partly because the setup promises a shotgun marriage of brains and brawn or at least of brains and physicality. Bullocks Ashburn and McCarthys Mullins enter the film as opposites and equals. Ashburn irritates fellow agents with her by-the-book formality. But in her introductory scene her knowledge of Prohibition-era architecture - which she uses to blow a case wide-open - makes her appear as wizardly and witty as a distaff Sherlock Holmes. A gag at the expense of uneducated thugs who think ""Prohibition"" means selling ones body suggests this movie might maintain a high comedy I.Q. Mullins cantankerous opening scene does contain some comic logic as she brings wily street reflexes to bear on a middle-class john as well as a pimp and low-level drug dealer named Rojas (Spoken Reasons). Shes like a John Belushi version of ""The French Connections"" Popeye Doyle. But as soon as Ashburns FBI boss (Demian Bichir) sends her to Beantown to break a big-time drug case she and Mullins clash over Rojas interrogation. Bullock doesnt stand a chance against McCarthys crowd-pleasing rants - and the movie begins to spiral out of control. In a cheap-joke way the repetitive formula sometimes works The audience loves to hear McCarthy spew putdowns especially against men. Its probably no accident that in another extended bit Mullins Boston family a parody of the raucous clan in ""The Fighter"" grills Ashburn on whether shes a woman a man or a transgender person. Still McCarthys portrayal of Mullins as the triumphant id - she even breaks mens hearts -- and Bullock playing Ashburn as a sexless priss in a pantsuit gradually throw the movie out of whack. Director Feig and screenwriter Katie Dippold hand Ashburn no effective comebacks and Bullock mistakenly bets that her under-the-breath comments will play well against McCarthys burlesque tirades. ""The Heat"" might have been funnier and more involving if the pair at least swapped successes. Ashburn is the butt of most of the jokes though Mullins who must have huffed and puffed her way through the police Physical Abilities Test supplies the bigger target. It should be hilarious to see Ashburn with the worlds knowledge at her manicured fingertips apply the Heimlich maneuver to a choking man and then perform an emergency tracheotomy. It turns out to be one more cringe-worthy gaffe for the know-it-all from the FBI - and another gutsy save for the streetwise gal from the BPD. In a scene thats almost charming Mullins - who keeps pushing men away who want to mate with her for life -- slashes Ashburns clothes from top to bottom trying to make her look sexy enough to attract a racketeer. Its a bit like Richard Pryor schooling Gene Wilder in how to be funky in ""Silver Streak."" The killer gag supposedly comes when Mullins tears Ashburns pants into shorts -- and reveals that shes wearing Spanx. It would be funny only if the filmmakers went all the way and showed Mullins trying to strip them off her partner. (Theyve somehow been removed by the time Ashburn makes her entrance as a would-be sexpot.) All everybody wants according to this film is a gal who lets it all hang out. The cast of ""The Heat"" is strewn with comic actors pushed into shtick (Jane Curtin Nathan Corddry Dan Bakkedahl) or given nothing even remotely funny to do (Taran Killam Marlon Wayans). Director Feig piles all his chips on McCarthy. She is gifted when it comes to timing. She can get laughs either by going matter-of-fact with her epithets or delivering them with a sustained intensity that would challenge the lungs of a deep-sea diver. But ""The Heat"" pushes her so hard you may feel less like laughing and more like crying uncle.

"Review The Heat lights up with new buddy-cop twist - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Heat lights up with new buddy-cop twist The Heat Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews The Heat starring Sandra Bullock Melissa McCarthy Tony Hale and Bill Burr. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews The Heat starring Sandra Bullock Melissa McCarthy Tony Hale and Bill Burr. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Film Critic ""The Heat"" starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy is the latest entry in a long-running and much-loved movie joke the buddy-cop comedy. In this case a bosom-buddy cop comedy.The movie follows a well-beaten path. Theyre cops theyre enemies theyre friends theyre opposites. Its funny. The legacy is a long one ""Beverly Hills Cop"" ""Tango amp; Cash"" ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" ""48 Hrs."" ""Men in Black"" ""Turner amp; Hooch"" ""Miami Vice."" Basically its a mans world.PHOTOS The Heat stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy But as director Paul Feig screenwriter Katie Dippold and the caustic crackling chemistry of its stars prove ""The Heat"" would be nothing nothing without a woman.Really one cannot over-emphasize the role that bosoms play literally and metaphorically. They are talked about pushed around prodded insulted dressed up dressed down. Theyre like another character. Occasionally they come in handy. And they remind us ""The Heat"" is not buddy-cop business as usual.Bullock and McCarthy as Ashburn and Mullins are from different agencies -- Ashburns New York City-based FBI Mullins Boston PD. Ones a Yale grad the other street-smart. They have different investigation techniques and different interrogation styles. Guess which one plays bad cop?A string of dicey unsolved Boston murders has thrown them unhappily together. As Mullins says during their first face to face ""Ive just spent the last 30 minutes thinking of ways to kill you."" PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Bickering bonding bad guys and a lot of very bad language mostly from McCarthys Mullins will ensue.That the movie manages to be funny without feeling misogynistic is in part because of Dippold wielding the pen. And not because shes a she. Dippold has been writing comedy for a while now starting in 2006 on Foxs underrated ""MADtv"" and moving over to handle punch lines for Amy Poehler Rashida Jones and others on the NBC show ""Parks and Recreation.""Meanwhile Feig with the mega-hit ""Bridesmaids"" to his credit has found a healthy balance between the raunchy and the real. The groundbreaking hard-R comedy in 2011 proved women could talk as dirty as guys but more important be as funny. It also established ""Saturday Night Live"" standout Kristen Wiig as a movie star and McCarthy as a comic force. Rex Reed insults and extra pounds be damned the actress is even better in ""The Heat.""McCarthy and Bullock are an odd and oddly likable team. Both actresses are fearless with physical comedy. Bullock specializes in awkward and uptight McCarthy in aggressive and unfiltered. ""The Heat"" makes the most of those differences.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsA particularly tight doorway pits them against each other but more often there is a guy about to find out that big -- as in big gun or big muscles or big wad of cash -- does not guarantee much of anything.For those worried that the essential action of the genre may have softened with chicks in the pic know that ""The Heat"" is down-and-dirty tough with all the gun brandishing foot races car chases and bruising confrontations with the criminal element an action fan could want.The rough sits surprisingly well with the more sentimental emotional arc Ashburn and Mullins are given. McCarthys character in particular is allowed nuance and that is a nice thing.Nice however is not where you go first.Our introduction to FBI agent Ashburn is a smug smile while brown-nosing the boss (Demian Bichir). Soon shes solving a case and taking great satisfaction in humiliating the rest of the FBI team. Shes got a closet full of monochrome suits that complement her monotone life. Her pajamas are pressed the cat she pets belongs to a neighbor and there is no family to speak of.RELATED More movie reviews by The TimesMullins is a foul-mouthed detective good at catching bad guys but not much else. Her captain fears her and not long into ""The Heat"" you understand why. Her family hasnt forgiven her for throwing brother Jason (Michael Rapaport) in jail -- thats the relationship to watch. Her fashion sensibility leans toward thrift store not chic more like dollar bin. When we meet her Mullins has spotted a john amid a proposition. Suffice it to say she is armed and dangerous with or without a gun.The villain is an elusive drug lord named Larkin. His brutality is legendary his face a mystery. Its a good twist but means the filmmakers have to throw in some other faces for us to hate in the meantime. There is DEA agent Craig (Dan Bakkedahl) a crude albino-chauvinist and his sycophant sidekick (Taran Killam). The DEA investigation is at odds with theirs and agent Craig is out to shut them down. Mullins favorite perp is a possible Larkin street dealer named Rojas (a funny Spoken Reasons). Also in Larkins circle is the very scary very good with knives Julian (Michael McDonald).But mostly this is Mullins and Ashburns run-and-gun show. At times ""The Heat"" gets messy and the comedy is not always pitch perfect. But theyre cops. Theyre enemies. Theyre friends. Theyre opposites.

This action comedy (    stars out of four rated R opens Friday nationwide) pairing Melissa McCarthy with Sandra Bullock is no less predictable but its bawdier and funnier than most of its masculine counterparts.The script by Katie Dippold draws cleverly on the pairs strong suits. McCarthy brings her envelope-pushing improvisational talents to the role of a freewheeling loudmouth beat cop. Put her with Bullock who can nimbly play an uptight klutzy FBI agent and the result is goofy hysterics. Though McCarthy gets more outright laughs the movie wouldnt work without Bullock as her straight woman. Its all about timing and chemistry which they have in spades.Those who thought McCarthy was a hoot in 2011sBridesmaids (a role that resulted in an Oscar nomination) will see more of her capabilities.Director Paul Feig who also directed Bridesmaids has a particularly savvy way with girl-centered comedy. He seems to know just when to get out of the way and let comic actors riff.STORY Heat director Paul Feig won success a step at a timeVIDEO Bullock McCarthy and Wayans brave The HeatMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarBullock plays Special Agent Sarah Ashburn as a blend of Detective Cagney the workaholic cop from the 80s TV show Cagney amp; Lacey with a bit of the unctuous zealousness of Barney Fife.McCarthys Boston police detective Shannon Mullins is her polar opposite. Where the Yale-educated Ashburn is prim multilingual and by-the-book Mullins is foul-mouthed and uses unorthodox methods to collar perps. She has a brother who has done time and a rowdy family that wont forgive her for arresting him.Both are gifted physical comedians. McCarthy throws her entire body into driving like a maniac and Bullock is hilarious and convincing as she drags herself around after being wounded.Despite their constant arguments and nattering the cops have one trait in common Neither plays well with others. Ashburn tends to be a prissy showoff and Mullins is impatient and nasty. Both are staunchly disliked by their male co-workers which hints at the workplace sexism in the field.Ashburns boss Capt. Hale (Demian Bichir) likes to remind her shes no team player. So he ships her off to Boston to nab a ruthless drug lord. Or maybe its just to get a break from listening to her overprecise pronunciation of Spanish words.In Boston she immediately runs afoul of Mullins as she treads self-righteously on her turf. Mullins finds Ashburn alternately pathetic and weird. Ashburn is dismayed by Mullins sloppy habits and profanity-laced vocabulary. And then theres Mullins family a rowdy bunch whose idea of art is sports-themed paintings with Jesus as the spotlighted athlete.Given buddy-cop cliches its no surprise that the two grudgingly become pals. But what makes the tired formula work so well is how these women embrace and gleefully send up the genre.Its not a perfect movie but it offers more laughs than any other this summer. The action drags toward the end and a scene in which Ashburn performs an emergency tracheotomy is more gross than comical.Given the various permutations of ""buddies"" that have populated the cop genre its a wonder that Hollywood has waited so long to again seize upon the concept of women as lethal weapons. Its about time. 88 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/12nDZgv",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/dYS7Srlo0w0/,200,theheat19,theheat,usatoday
"The Heat an undercooked cop comedy review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Heat an undercooked cop comedy reviewTeaming Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy is a no-brainer. Unfortunately so is the script and direction.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 27 2013The HeatStarring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. Directed by Paul Feig. 117 minutes. Opens June 28 at major theatres. 14AThe Heat is locked loaded and lacking.Teaming Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy for a good cop/bad cop comedy is a no-brainer. Both will do anything for a laugh and they click as a comic couple.Article Continued BelowRegrettably ""no-brainer"" also describes the weak script by TV writer Katie Dippold (Parks and Recreation) and the aimless direction by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids). Neither hand seems to know what to do with Bullock and McCarthy apart from endlessly clashing and rehashing their perfectionist vs. vulgarian character stereotypes.According to Variety there are more than 180 variants of the ""F"" word in The Heat. The number seems low by my count and if the profanity doesnt get you the weaponry might a distressing number of guns knives and other offensive weapons are in sight and in use.If there were half that many good laughs in the film or even a quarter as many there would be reason to rave rather than carp. Bullocks FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn is more upright and uptight than the know-it-all FBI woman Bullock played in Miss Congeniality. Ashburn lives to bust bad guys while at the same time showing up her all-male colleagues.McCarthys Boston Police Detective Shannon Mullins is yet another version of the loose cannon McCarthy has essayed since hitting the big time with Bridesmaids. Shes a regular Dirty Harriet who smacks shoots or shouts down anybody who interferes with her dedication to getting the scum off ""her"" streets. She keeps an arsenal of guns and ammo in her eyesore of an apartment.Ashburn and Mullins are obliged to work together after a mysterious drug lord crosses jurisdictions and invades the Boston crime scene. The two women loathe each other on sight but Ashburn has to prove she can get along with local cops if she wants that bureau promotion shes gunning for. And Mullins wants any info the FBI lady may have up her tailored sleeve.The cookie-cutter plot might have worked if the jokes were good. But for much of its overlong running time The Heat simply warms over set pieces whereby foul-mouthed Mullins acts out while by-the-book Ashburn acts appalled. Main offender Feig originally hails from standup comedy where a comic lives or dies by being able to read a room and switch topics when a joke isnt working. And it should go without saying that brevity beats blather.Feig has forgotten these important lessons. He beats jokes to death working on the theory that something that was mildly funny once will be hilarious after the 10th repetition as when Mullins humiliates her police captain (Tom Wilson) by pretending to search for his missing cojones.Other gags are simply weird as when Ashburn and Mullins rush to assist a choking man in a restaurant and end up performing an amateur tracheotomy rather than the Heimlich manoeuvre. Blood sprays everywhere but the scene serves no purpose other than to gross people out -- and it surely does that.At 117 minutes the film runs a good half hour past maximum mirth. Bridesmaids was long too but there Feig had the advantage of a bigger cast of female comics led by Kristen Wiig and a significantly better screenplay. The Heat was reportedly shot quickly in between McCarthys many film and TV obligations and it looks and sounds every bit the rush job it is.You can see glimmers of how much better the movie could have been if Dippold had tightened up the screenplay and Feig had found more focus for the film. The mutual loneliness of Mullins and Ashburn is hinted at but never explored to its full comic or dramatic potential.Bullock and McCarthy do the best they can with the material and they manage a few good laughs especially when their characters stop fighting each other and begin working together. Meanwhile what of the men in The Heat? The various cops and cons played by the likes of Demian Bichir Marlon Wayans and Michael Rapaport exist solely as one-note foils for the comedy of Bullock and McCarthy. They get treated the way -- gasp -- women are always treated in male-dominated comedies.

A Capitol policeman (Channing Tatum) springs into action to save his child and protect the president (Jamie Foxx) from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders. (Photo/Video Columbia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 27 2013 532 p.m. ET Never mind that ""White House Down"" tells essentially the same story told three months ago in ""Olympus Has Fallen""--terrorists invading the White House taking the president hostage and trashing the premises--or that the filmmaker Roland Emmerich totaled the very same building in ""Independence Day."" (His latest opus acknowledges the repetition with a wink and a nod.) Mr. Emmerich who has often conjured with cosmic themes sometimes wittily achieves something new this time around--a level of indifference to the genre and its fans that amounts to a cosmic shrug. What does it matter if the absurdity is slovenly the whimsy leaden the extravagance squalid? Moviegoers sensibilities or so he seems to have concluded are already deadened by a dying genre; stage this dopey stuff as a comedy of chaos and the audience will buy it. If theres one thing more dismaying than his approach its the possibility that hes right. ENLARGE Channing Tatum Columbia Pictures Before trashing the cinematic premises I should give the production its due. This wont take long because the only due worth giving is the presence of Channing Tatum. He plays Cale an earnest overachieving D.C. cop who saves President Sawyer-- Jamie Foxx wielding heavy weapons with more energy than conviction--and foils the terrorists. In the ""Olympus"" iteration the bad guys were North Koreans. This time theyre white supremacists and biker dudes in the service of a government turncoat all of them aided by a computer genius who seems to have been plugged into the script like a thumb drive. (The all-thumbs writer of credit is James Vanderbilt.) The movie may or may not have validated Mr. Tatum as an action hero--he should still study Tom Cruises action films for lessons in stylized running--but it certainly displays his energy bemuscled build and easy charm. Thats in spite of spates of inane dialogue (""I know youre into peace"" Cale tells the president whos holding a bazooka launcher on his lap while the presidential limo evades bad guys in a sort of Mack Sennett chase on the White House lawn ""but stick that thing out the window."") And its in spite of the preteen daughter Mr. Tatums character is saddled with a precocious twirpette and compulsive blogger whose knowledge of the White House helps save the day her dad and the Republic. One of the many depressing questions raised by ""White House Down"" is why so many Hollywood movies these days seem to be cut from the same tattered cloth even if they arent like this one near-duplicates of recent releases. Part of the answer is production costs. Big-budget features have become so expensive that studio executives take reflexive refuge in the large-scale familiar which in this category includes terrorist conspiracies weapons of mass destruction global threats squadrons of choppers streams of black SUVs and swarms of black-clad men hollering ""Go Go Go"" In that sense ""White House Down"" is solidly within its genre. In a deeper sense though it bespeaks a fatigue thats hard to distinguish from brain death. Watch a clip from the film ""The Heat."" Uptight FBI special agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) is paired with testy Boston cop Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) in order to take down a ruthless drug lord. (Photo/Video Fox) The Heat Before considering this numbing spectacle lets stipulate that Melissa McCarthy is an unusually gifted comedian. Shes unusual not only because shes fat--lots of todays Americans are fatter without being funny--but because of the cheerfully irreverent zestfully vulgar take-no-prisoners spirit she revealed so delightfully as the crazed Megan in ""Bridesmaids."" That spirit was subsequently soured in ""Identity Thief"" which cast her as an electronic kleptomaniac and turned her into a grotesque by upping the ante on her vulgarity. Now she has gone from bad to worse in the ""The Heat"" a crude--and clearly commercial--comedy in which she plays Mullins a loose bazooka of a Boston cop (yes she too wields one of those things) opposite Sandra Bullocks smug control-freaky Ashburn an FBI agent assigned to a Boston drug case. ENLARGE Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock 20th Century Fox Grotesque doesnt begin to describe Ms. McCarthys new character. Scarily insane comes closer; repulsive occasionally applies. Mullinss insanity can be extremely funny from time to time but her anger grows as punishing for the audience as it does for the victims of her unrestrained police work and Ms. Bullock is more to be pitied than censored in her thankless role of straight woman to a garrulous psychopath. ( Paul Feig directed from a script by Katie Dippold. Mr. Feig also directed ""Bridesmaids""; its one more reminder that life is full of mysteries.) ""The Heat 2"" has already been announced so the producers must have faith in this latest twist on the mismatched-buddies formula. One wonders though what the future holds for Ms. McCarthys career if every new film is going to exploit her more shamelessly than the previous one. Beware the long arm of the law of diminishing returns. Watch a clip from the film ""Im So Excited"" When it appears that a flight is doomed the flight crew and passengers look to forget the anguish of the moment and face the greatest danger which we carry within ourselves. (Photo/Video Sony) Im So Excited Theres never been a movie quite like Pedro Almodovars pastel-colored ""Im So Excited"" (in Spanish with English subtitles.) Its a gay farce with interludes of cabaret crossed with ""Airplane"" The setting is mostly the cockpit and business-class cabin of a crippled--and haunted--Airbus A340 thats stuck in a holding pattern over Toledo Spain; even the instrument-panel displays glow in the soft hues that the filmmaker loves. The pilots and flight attendants are sex-obsessed while the passengers who have their own sex-and-substance issues are madly impassioned compelled to tell their lurid stories and intricately connected by fate. (Economy-class passengers hardly figure in the action because theyve been drugged into submission by the crew.) The films gleeful celebration of sexuality recalls Mr. Almodovars earliest work but ""Im So Excited"" conveys an impression of the great man straining for laughs and of the story as an extended trifle he needed to get out of his system. ENLARGE A scene from Im So Excited El Deseo/Sony Pictures Classics That said some of it qualifies as first-class hilarity and all of the acting is superb. Lola Duenas defines droll as a dulcetly crazed psychic. Cecilia Roth is a faded queen of the gossip magazines and past mistress of the blackmailing arts. Javier Camara Carlos Areces and Raul Arevalo are flight attendants who create the comic zenith of the proceedings by coming together as an ad hoc trio and miming the Pointer Sisters hit ""Im So Excited."" I just cant hide my disappointment though that the movie doesnt sustain anything like the brilliance of its best scenes or even the promise of its preface with a couple of throwaway cameos by two superlatively engaging performers They play ground-crew workers involved in removing the wheel chocks that provoke the ""Airplane"" part of the plot. Jose Luis Alcaine was the cinematographer and Alberto Iglesias did the marvelous score. Watch a clip from the film ""The Attack."" An Arab surgeon living in Tel Aviv discovers a dark secret about his wife in the aftermath of a suicide bombing. Based on a novel by Yasmina Khadra. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) The Attack Before a terrorist attack that takes 19 lives and turns another life upside down Ziad Doueiris strong and sobering drama which goes into national distribution this week paints an appealing portrait of a happy man who has it all. Amin Jaafari played splendidly by Ali Suliman is an Arab-Israeli surgeon working at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Hes thoroughly assimilated has a wife he adores and is widely admired by his peers and his many Jewish friends. Then a suicide bombing at a nearby restaurant brings a stream of grievously injured survivors into the hospital and later the terrible news that Amins wife was among the victims and may in fact have been the suicide bomber. ENLARGE Reymond Amsalem and Ali Suliman Cohen Media Could Amin have known about his wifes political sympathies and radical inclinations? An Israeli friend--a captain in the Shin Bet Israels internal state-security agency--insists that he must have known and suddenly accuses him of being one of those ""fake seculars"" who conceal their Islamic roots. (In a drama of expert performances and otherwise deftly controlled polemics its unfortunate that the Shin Bet agent is portrayed as a brutish thug.) For his own part Amin finds his new situation unfathomable; how could he not have known who his wife had become let alone what murderous plot she was up to? Searching for answers he goes to the Palestinian territories--where hes suspected of being a Shin Bet agent--in hopes of tracking down the people who recruited her. What he learns in the process is how little he has known about himself having become the model of an integrated Arab by cutting himself off from what a fellow Palestinian describes as ""a ravaged people."" The director Mr. Doueiri left his native Lebanon to study film in the U.S.; between 1987 and 1997 he worked as an assistant camera operator and camera operator on films that included Quentin Tarantinos ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" This is his third feature film--he and Joelle Touma based the screenplay on the novel by Yasmina Khadra--and its remarkably accomplished and self-confident. In dramatic terms ""The Attack"" borrows a page from Alfred Hitchcocks playbook--an innocent in a strange land delving into dangerous matters he doesnt understand. In political terms though the script is unsparing and ultimately bleak. It doesnt justify terrorism but it does dramatize the rage and despair that dominate life in the occupied territories. Amin isnt innocent the film contends; he was simply ignorant of conditions that radicalized his wife and may now do the same to him. ENLARGE DVD Focus All the Presidents Men (1976) A different kind of story from a bygone era about bringing the White House down. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein the Washington Post reporters--now enshrined in the history of journalism as Woodstein--who followed the Watergate money all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and were pivotal in the sequence of events that led to President Nixons resignation. Jason Robards is unforgettable as the Post editor Ben Bradlee. Hal Holbrook is Deep Throat. Alan J. Pakula directed from William Goldmans exemplary screenplay. The peerless Gordon Willis was the cinematographer. ENLARGE Infamous (2006) Sandra Bullock at her best--as an actress not a star--in a freely fictionalized film about Truman Capote and ""In Cold Blood"" that Douglas McGrath adapted from a George Plimpton book of interviews. Ms. Bullock is Nelle Harper Lee a novelist who uses spoken words with quiet precision. Toby Jones plays Capote as a charming aggressively gay elf who turns out to be a contemptible worm. The convicted killer Perry Smith is a deluded monster though forthright and strong as played by Daniel Craig who became the new James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" later the same year. ENLARGE Volver (2006) Lola Duenas looks like shes seen a ghost long after she knows better in Pedro Almodovars shaggy ghost story which is also a meditation on the culture of death; a slapstick comedy about disposing of a corpse; a celebration of sisterhood strong women and reconciliation; and a return therefore to some of the themes of Mr. Almodovars ""All About My Mother."" Ms. Duenas is Sole the heroines sister. Penelope Cruz as the heroine Raimunda is dazzling witty and mercurial yet all the while implacably grounded like the legendary Anna Magnani who shows up briefly on a TV screen. --J.M. 30 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

She gets wind of an elusive drug lord working out of Boston; unfortunately theres another lady on the case--brassy bawdy cop Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) whos cleaning up her neighborhood one scumbag at a time. The two certainly dont get off on the right foot; Mullins nearly knocks Ashburn off of hers when the G-woman sneakily tries to interview a perp. But soon enough they realize their outlaw-apprehending talents are complementary--like Nolte and Murphy or Gibson and Glover before them. As in any buddy comedy chemistry is key--and Bullock and McCarthy have it in spades. Watch the way they constantly adjust to each others physical and verbal rhythms and youre often left in awe at their adeptness (notably in a gut-busting nightclub scene in which Mullins tries to get her partner to come out of her shell). Would that director Paul Feig displayed any visual imagination beyond dully flat lighting and yeoman camera setups or that the films weird tonal whiplash between ribaldry sentimentality and extreme violence--a knife to the thigh here a bullet to the head there--didnt temper the hilarity generated by the stars. They deserve a much stronger showcase than this Laurel amp; Hardy Go Policin vehicle.

Photo Everett Collection Melissa McCarthy as a potty-mouthed rule-defying Boston plainclothes cop demonstrates a unique method for interrogating a suspect in the often hilarious buddy comedy ""The Heat -- she plays Russian roulette with her service revolver aimed at a male drug dealers genitals. This procedure horrifies a by-the-book control-freak FBI agent -- winningly played by Sandra Bullock in her first comedy since she took home an Oscar three years ago for ""The Blind Side"" -- reluctantly forced to work with McCarthys loose-cannon character to secure a promotion. Theres nothing remotely original or surprising about Katie Dippolds generic script. But the script and director Paul Feig (who directed McCarthy in ""Bridesmaids) provide great opportunities for both actresses to do what they do best and demonstrate their positively combustible comic chemistry. Though the two characters personal styles and approaches to criminal justice couldnt be more different both are socially maladroit misfits surrounded by condescending male co-workers. Sandra Bullock (left) plays a straight-laced FBI agent while Melissa McCarthy assumes the role of a potty-mouthed Boston cop in ""The Heat."" (Everett Collection) Bullocks whip-smart agent routinely alienates colleagues by showing them up while McCarthys cops bullying and profane insults have turned the hair of her exasperated boss (Thomas Wilson) prematurely gray. Bullock can do a double-takes better than any actress working today and boy does force-of-nature McCarthy give her plenty to work with. McCarthys character bulldozes her way through her job all the while spouting a nonstop aria of profanities crude sexual jokes and the occasional casually racist remark. At one point the plot requires our heroines to plant a bug in the cell phone of a suspect at a posh nightclub. I was convulsed with laughter watching the motor-mouthed McCarthy whip out a pair of scissors to perform an impromptu makeover on Bullock so her partner can get close to the guy. This is not the first time Bullock has played a clumsy FBI agent -- there was ""Miss Congeniality and its sequel -- but she doesnt resort to her trademark snort this time while showing her facility for knockabout physical comedy (and willingness to make herself look ridiculous) is undiminished at the age of 48. The hefty McCarthy throws her weight around to considerable comic effect and few actresses could pull off a scene where her Dirty Harriet-style cop proudly shows off a well-stocked armory in her refrigerator. She also comes equipped with the most dysfunctional Boston family since ""The Fighter including Jane Curtin (under-used as her mother) and Michael Rapaport as a brother she sent to jail for dealing drugs. This helps humanize McCarthys character -- which while far from gentle is less abrasive and obnoxious than McCarthys sociopathic role in ""Identity Thief. Third-billed Mexican actor Demian Bichir (an Oscar nominee for ""A Better Life) has little to do but act exasperated or bemused as Bullocks agents FBI boss while fourth-billed Marlon Wayans as another FBI agent apparently had most of his scenes land on the cutting-room floor. The movies standard-issue villains are even less interesting but that doesnt matter much. This is Bullock and McCarthys show and Feig gives them plenty of room to do their things. (Even if like most veterans of the Judd Apatow atelier he tends to let scenes run on a bit too long.) ""The Heat which provides enough opportunity for wholesale mayhem as well as laughs is pretty much a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Small wonder that Fox has already ordered up a sequel for this inspired female comedy team. Follow loulumenick on Twitter for the latest movie news and reviews.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An uptight FBI agent and a rowdy Boston cop team up to catch a drug lord. Rated R (violence language drug use) BOTTOM LINE An unexpectedly terrific buddy-cop comedy with McCarthy at her rudest crudest and funniest yet. CAST Melissa McCarthy Sandra Bullock LENGTH 156 The best lines in the R-rated action-comedy ""The Heat"" arent printable in this family newspaper. Actually make that all the lines. Which is a shame because its going to be tough to convey just how terrifically funny this movie is. ""The Heat"" a buddy-cop film starring Sandra Bullock as uptight FBI agent Sarah Ashburn and Melissa McCarthy as slovenly Boston cop Shannon Mullins is the rare throwaway comedy that somehow gets everything right. Its also a case of a genuine talent -- McCarthy hence those unprintable lines -- really coming into her own. Shes been on the rise ever since her raunchy turn in ""Bridesmaids"" but with ""The Heat"" (both directed by Paul Feig) McCarthy is now officially a star. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Mullins is the kind of character McCarthy has been honing for a while -- loud crass no class all heart -- and here she plays it to perfection. Bullock no comedic slouch herself is endearing as Ashburn a goody-goody with more merit awards than friends. But once McCarthy appears (busting a john chasing a drug dealer emasculating her boss) the film kicks into overdrive. The script from debut writer Katie Dippold may be skimpy -- the two women overcome mutual loathing to catch a drug lord -- but its a sturdy skeleton for the real meat which is our heroines budding friendship. ""The Heat"" like ""Bridesmaids"" is a female twist on a typically male genre (the obvious touchstone is ""Lethal Weapon"") and its great fun to watch these women strike back at the men be they criminals or colleagues. (Marlon Wayans as a fellow Fed is the films obligatory cutie.) McCarthy owns this movie but nearly everyone in it is hilarious. Not just the secondary characters (Jane Curtin plays Mullins hostile mom) but the walk-on parts the extras even the animals (one running gag involves an abject failure of a police dog). Credit goes to Feig who barely wastes a millisecond without going for a laugh. 206 MoviesThe Heat trailer The result is a giddy anarchic comedy that could become a populist classic like ""Silver Streak"" ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or ""Foul Play"" (explicitly referred to twice here). Stay for the credits -- even those are funny. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT An uptight FBI agent and a rowdy Boston cop team up to catch a drug lord.

In The Heat which has the scruffy honor of being the first female buddy-cop action comedy Melissa McCarthy does more than risk looking foolish -- she risks coming off as borderline insane like a dissolute biker?turned?homeless person like shes royally out of control. Is it any wonder that she shocks the audience into laughter in more scenes than not? With her naughty-angel features and her italicized gumption thats so stylized it turns sarcasm into a blunt-witted form of sincerity McCarthy plays Shannon Mullins a proudly slobby lethal weapon of a Boston police detective who favors fingerless leather gloves keeps an arsenal of firearms (including a rocket launcher) in her refrigerator and doles out cut-to-the-quick insults the way that most of us say ""Hello"" Mullins gets paired with her opposite number Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) an uptight by-the-book FBI agent in ugly off-the-rack pants suits. Ashburn may be great at catching criminals but shes so smug about it that she drives even her FBI boss (Demian Bichir) crazy. The laws of the buddy-cop comedy are as basic familiar and inviolable as the rules of checkers. A pair of law enforcers get yoked together and they dont pretend to like each other. One is a tut-tutting straight-arrow the other a wild-card screw-up. And no matter how thick the jokes get the gods of gunfire and major vehicular damage must be served. Theres no reason to think that this time-honored testosterone formula with two actresses now planted at the center of it would change all that much and in The Heat it doesnt. Except in one crucial way. The director Paul Feig possesses a highly developed radar for the alternating currents of competition and camaraderie in female relationships. As he proved in Bridesmaids (2011) the one other major film hes directed Feig understands how women who dont like each other express their antipathy -- in ways both more direct and less direct than what men do. In The Heat Feig stages scenes like Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) with a touch of George Cukor (The Women). He has made a piece of smash-and-grab policier pulp that through the interplay of Bullock and McCarthy spins to its own snarly/confessional feminine beat. Theres a very funny scene in which Ashburn and Mullins who have teamed up to nab a drug lord go undercover at a dance club where Mullins tries to transform Ashburns ""bank teller"" outfit into something halfway clubby. She rips off Ashburns sleeves then her pant legs revealing a pair of Spanx. Yet even as Mullins is shredding her partners clothes and shredding her ego even more her hilarious lack of mercy comes off as a version of sisterly compassion. Forget the mid-level dealer whose phone theyre out to bug. Shes trying to save this poor woman from herself. Ashburns problem is that shes all head and no instinct a kind of Quantico-trained robot; she doesnt know how to bond. McCarthy plays Mullins repugnance at her partners inhuman professionalism with a cringing spontaneity as when she puts up her hand for a high five and Ashburn has to go and wreck it by slapping and then clasping that hand. (Its far from the only time in the movie when Mullins looks like she wants to throw up a motif you would not see in a male buddy comedy.) As long as these two are at loggerheads The Heat has a catchy lock-and-load hostility. Its much more clever than say the two Bad Boys films and less cartoonish than either the Rush Hour movies or the Lethal Weapon sequels (though not Lethal Weapon itself). With Bullock doing a variation on her Miss Congeniality geek-tomboy-who-has-to-bloom character and McCarthy letting her acidly oddball observations rip the two actresses make their interplay bubble. When Mullins confuses Ashburns overly fussy pair of pajamas with a tuxedo its all wrong yet somehow right. And when the partners go to an old mans bar and do shots all night dancing to Deee-Lites ""Groove Is In the Heart"" the drunken craziness is infectious enough to make you want to join them. But once these two get to be friends the comic tension dissipates and the films boilerplate drug-dealer plot takes over and goes on and on. The Heat is fresher than a lot of the male-centric movies it takes off from because theres little about aggressive guy banter that hasnt been worn to the ground by Hollywood. You can tell how much the times have changed when Ashburn gets an oyster-shucking knife stuck in her thigh then pulled out then shoved back or when she performs a graphic emergency tracheotomy -- and the blood-gushing grossness is in every sense a gag. Its genuinely jolting (in a way that I suspect may prove highly commercial) to see women go through these motions. But the motions are still market-tested and machine-tooled. Even when theyre channeling the happy madness of Melissa McCarthy.

Prior to that blissful and willful ignorance pervaded and as such the buddy cop films involving the fellas into theaters included but were not limited to ""48 Hours"" ""Beverly Hills Cop"" ""Cop Out"" ""Se7en"" (I said buddy not comedy) ""Hot Fuzz"" ""Lethal Weapon"" ""Starsky and Hutch"" ""Rush Hour"" ""Bad Boys"" ""Dragnet"" ""Point Break"" ""Tango amp; Cash"" ""Turner amp; Hootch"" ""Rising Sun"" ""The Other Guys"" ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"" And buddy cop films featuring female cops in lead roles were as follows (cricket noises) So as you can see prior to ""The Heat"" the women in the male buddy cop films were largely relegated to ""oh no please save me"" type characterizations (or being moms who shoot at people). In each case hard-boiled partners tracked down a suspect potentially playing it for laughs maybe pausing to pop a separated shoulder out on socket all while underwater (and drowning) no less. Some of these films were solid some not so much but all of them pretty much missed the boat on both the 1) half the population and 2) women are also in law enforcement angle. It was as if Hollywood woke up each day anew and said ""What are the fellas up to today? Whats good out there guys?"" In their defense they did the same thing with ""Best Director"" for 80 odd years so theyre nothing if not consistent over there in tinsel town. Still all of this historical testosterone goes a long way toward explaining why ""The Heat"" is a breathe of fresh air though its largely reminiscent of previous films. In some strange way its heartening to note women can get away with the same playbook as men even if the real result is hopefully a new playbook at some point down the line. All preaching aside ""The Heat"" is a buddy cop comedy and wed do ourselves a disservice to not treat it like all the rest of them while noting we appreciate the diversity. Melissa McCarthy is Boston PD Detective Mullins and she fills the ""bad/crazy"" cop angle extremely well. Shes the crassness of Mark Wahlberg in ""The Other Guys"" paired with the laughing at authority personality trait of Hutch in ""Starsky and Hutch"". She definitely doesnt do things by the book but her heart and foul mouth are always in the right place even though shes a walking talking abuse of police power. Which leaves Sandra Bullock as FBI Special Agent Ashburn as the square foil in the comedy. Shes all about process all about a kinder gentler law enforcement all about relying on her smarts while avoiding acts of physical intimidation. If youre out there saying ""well thats basically the angle every buddy comedy takes opposite ends of the spectrum equal laughs"" then youd be correct. Also check out Why We Cant have ""The Heat"" Without Having ""Dirty Harriet"" First Now then if one were looking for a similar movie only in masculine film there are many parallels between ""The Heat"" and ""The Other Guys"" almost to the point where they could be considered siblings branches from the same comedy tree. The main difference between the two films is ""The Other Guys"" managed a PG-13 while ""The Heat"" is a hard I repeat hard R. The language used by McCarthy alone is epic variations of cursing you rarely hear outside of prison exercise yards. Violence is also gleefully mixed in and ""The Heat"" is the far more ""in your face"" of the two films. But once you get past those angles there are huge similarities from Good Cop/Bad Cop routines all the way down to pacing and structure. ""The Other Guys"" is more preachy where the financial crisis is concerned but in both cases the department leadership lets them down the go rogue and they need a montage with serious musical interludes to sort things out. Both films go to the well early and often on dry deadpan realistic comedy which works well and there are huge laughs to be had in each movie including one near the end of ""The Heat"" which had me crushed me with hilarity. What Im getting at is this - there are worse films to be compared to than ""The Other Guys"". That film is entertaining this one is too and fans of comedy wont be disappointed. Though a few of the angles are rote the Boston accent comes to mind the movie doesnt shy away from employs any and all means necessary to get at least a chuckle out of most scenes in the nearly two-hour running time. What does ""The Heat"" get all wrong? It dips too far into ""serious"" mode for a ten minute section of the film that just should have been cut. We were having fun over here ""The Heat"" not sure why you decided to take us to ""Feelingsville"". Its always strange when comedies make this choice 90 minutes in like a friend you take out to a bar who breaks down at 2am and tells you hes been living a lie. Whoa there fella lets just have another bottle of vino. Additionally ""The Heat"" utilizes epic (and graphic) hip hop to set the tone examples of which include Angel Hazes ""Werkin Girls"" and ""212"" from Azealia Banks (Oddly ""The Bling Ring"" uses the same song meaning Hollywood decadence and empowerment are finally colliding in one weird mishmash of cultural shifting). Overall ""The Heat"" executes a bawdy and belligerent comedy meant mostly for folks looking for nothing more than to enjoy a few laughs. Nothing world-changing happens but additionally nothing transpires which would indicate that women werent meant for hard R cop comedies all along. It certainly seems as if weve been cutting off half the population and all while miserably wasting Sandra Bullocks career with one lame rom-com after the other. I say we put a gun in her hand a Melissa McCarthy at her side and from here on out we just roll with switching things up.

Bullock has played a cop several times before and shes played a straight-laced workaholic before too. But shes never quite done the improv-style go-for-broke brand of comedy perfected by the Apatow Brigade and shows like The Office. McCarthy has come into her own in recent years thanks to precisely this style of anything-goes humor. We know our mismatched heroines will eventually find a way to work together and become besties. But will the two mismatched comic genres? Maybe. The Heat is kind of a mess but its a funny mess. Bullock plays Ashburn a highly competent by-the-books FBI agent with no life. (Her only company is a cat -- her neighbors.) McCarthy is Mullins the vulgar loose cannon Boston detective whom Ashburn has to work with in order to apprehend a brutal drug kingpin. Its no Beverly Hills Cop but The Heat does spend a decent amount of time with its cops n robbers plot -- bizarre because its such a nothing story. So the film sometimes feels lax disjointed like its just wasting time until the next comic set piece rolls around. The good news is that said set piece usually does roll around. And when its on The Heat is on. (God did I just say that?) Actually the banter between Ashburn and Mullins the ostensible highlight and selling point of the movie (watch Sandy the tightwad square off against Melissa the boor) is less uproarious than just charmingly awkward with the two repeatedly misunderstanding and stumbling over each others sentences. Its chuckleworthy stuff but thats as far as it goes. The big laughs come though whenever our heroines have to interact with anyone else as the oft-bewildered supporting cast ping-pongs between Ashburns neurotic daftness and Mullinss hair-trigger lunacy. Burning especially bright are the scenes with the latters family a collection of Southie-accented Massholes who look like they came straight from the blooper reel for The Fighter and who launch into foul-mouthed tirades upon seeing their wayward offspring. (Mullins put one of them in jail see.) Director Paul Feig (who also made Bridesmaids) isnt much for pacing but hes a good gag man and he knows his way around actors Bullock is so good as the hapless nerd who tries to do everything right that its a wonder anyone ever tried to pass her off as Americas Sweetheart. And McCarthy as always is hard to resist. More than any other comic actor working today she has the ability to make every word coming out of her lips feel like its being thought up on the spot rather than recited from memory. Every actor is supposed to do this of course but she does it better than most. At its best The Heat is profane ludicrous and violent but it never feels gratuitous for some reason. Theres even a fairly substantial body count -- which ordinarily might work against a movie like this as The Hangover Part III found out recently. But here because the actual jokes around it are funny the violence has the intended effect -- to jar us and raise our pulses because we laugh harder when were excited. To be fair not all of it works as well as it should An emergency tracheotomy scene (dont ask) feels like a random attempt to mimic the cringing body horror of Bridesmaids and the repeated gags about Dan Bakkedahls albino rival cop (""You look evil as shit"" Mullins exclaims upon seeing him) lose their kick after a while. But the cast is good the jokes are mostly funny and whenever it starts to wear out its welcome The Heat pulls out another decent gag to keep things moving. I look forward to half-watching it again on cable one day.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin When Miss Congeniality goes up against Miss Vulgarity can there be a doubt about whos going to win? As a tightly wound FBI agent in ""The Heat"" Sandra Bullock gamely jousts for attention with Melissa McCarthys coarse Boston-Irish detective. But from the moment she barrels onto the scene like a cannonball of crudity McCarthy makes it clear that this movie is hers to make or break. And she knocks it right out of Fenway Park with a big assist from director Paul Feig who previously brought out her Oscar-nominated best in ""Bridesmaids."" Agent Sarah Ashburn (Bullock) is cocky and in control until shes teamed with Detective Shannon Mullins (McCarthy) a cursing hellion in sweatpants and black fingerless gloves to take down a drug kingpin. Its the old class-meets-crass setup of many a buddy-cop movie but what makes it fresh is McCarthys freestyle fearlessness. She pulls off antics that would draw groans if not bristles of offense in anyone elses hands -- taking down a perp who is black by beaning him with a watermelon insulting an albino. Mullins whose m.o. is ""shoot off mouth first ask questions later"" doesnt bother to open her piehole unless shes spitting out something shocking. Like a live-stream of the id run amok she induces as many gasps of the ""Oh no she didnt"" kind as she does belly laughs. The plot is as cliched as they come but relying on that is missing the point. The chemistry between Bullock and McCarthy as they go from adversaries to loyal pals is the story worth watching. Theyre as tough as any male pairing of the genre -- Gibson and Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"" Murphy and Nolte in ""48 Hours"" -- but they bring a strong ""girlfriends"" feeling to the table. They can get blind drunk on Jagermeister shots in a dive bar and take a knife in the leg like champs but they also argue about Spanx and barrettes and discuss choosing career over marriage and kids. That conversation is refreshingly brief; this movie is about friendship not romance. Though it often seems as if McCarthy and Bullock are ad-libbing their lines the script is an impressive feature-film debut for writer Katie Dippold whose TV credits are ""Parks amp; Recreation"" and ""MADtv."" The action flat-lines at several points but thats offset by an endless parade of small roles and cameos from familiar funny faces including Michael McDonald Marlon Wayans and Jane Curtin. Even Ben Falcone (McCarthys husband better known around here as the weird music teacher in those Target denim commercials from a couple of years ago) makes a momentary appearance as a lovelorn former suitor. Further reinforcements come from Mullins caricature of a family complete with a Great Dane named Kevin Garnett and tacky paintings blending Jesus and sports. 20th Century Fox Sandra Bullock left and Melissa McCarthy throw down in the ladies room over the purpose of Spanx in ""The Heat."" Amid buzz that ""The Heat 2"" is already in the works whats most notable about the original is that it stars two over-40 women actors and its not a rom-com. That calls for a shot of Jager.

"The Heat Review Female Buddy Cop Comedy Sacrifices Action for Laughs | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Heat Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 6 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr June 27 2013 | 1128AM PT Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy play a reluctant buddy-cop pair in an R-rated comedy that sacrifices action for consistent laughs. They dont get along onscreen but Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy have a field day in ""The Heat."" While the title refers to the reluctant buddy-cop pair it may just as well describe the packaging philosophy behind this R-rated comedy Grab director Paul Feig as ""Bridesmaids"" breaks B.O. records give him an on-fire spec script from ex-""Conan"" intern Katie Dippold and attach two Oscar-forged stars Bullock hot off her ""The Blind Side"" win and McCarthy about to be nominated. With elements like these the pics shoot-first fix-it-later approach sacrifices action for consistent laughs delivering on the front that should make ""The Heat"" a hit. Dippolds script is hardly the first distaff-driven comedy to demonstrate that a pair of lady cops can hold their own in a notoriously testosterone-heavy field -- with all due respect to Ginger Rogers this duo accomplishes everything the guys can backward and in tactical boots. From ""Feds"" to ""D.E.B.S."" its well-trod territory and yet the key to Feigs approach comes in embracing the lesson of ""Bridesmaids"" namely that female comedies neednt be dainty but can get just as raunchy as their Y-chromosome counterparts even without Judd Apatow attached. SEE ALSO The Heat Director Gets Honest Laughs Feig who got his big break creating ""Freaks and Geeks"" 13 years back no doubt owes much of his approach to Apatow his fellow ""Geeks"" exec producer. It certainly shows in the improv-heavy films tendency to run longer than the material demands as well as the generally shaggy way the funniest subplots get the most screentime (how many sports-themed Jesus paintings can one pic support?) while others dead-end entirely Despite great lengths taken to bug a criminals cell phone the two cops never bother to listen in on his calls. Breaking it down ""The Heat"" has been engineered to deliver the laughs and the result certainly does despite coming alarmingly near to botching the procedural elements along the way. The bumpy car chases police interrogations and heavy-artillery standoffs work only insofar as Feig can rely on humor to steal the scene. Lucky for him he had two editors to assemble a sometimes-uneven cut that puts the funny forward and two gifted comedic actresses in Bullock and McCarthy to back him up. Resurrecting a fair amount of her ""Miss Congeniality"" persona Bullock plays Sarah Ashburn a socially awkward FBI agent angling for a promotion. Theres no clumsiness here however Ashburn is aces at her job just totally devoid of people skills. Assigned to bring down a Boston drug lord she immediately steps on the toes of the top cop on the local beat a Dirty Harry type named Shannon Mullins (McCarthy) whose track record evidently excuses her own equally abrasive style. Naturally these two incompatible personalities will have to work together to crack the case. For better or worse the mismatched chemistry clearly extends behind the scenes as well. Whereas McCarthy flourishes in an ad lib-friendly environment Bullock is stuck playing straight woman. Its impossible to forget that Bullock is merely pretending to be unlikable and robotic as if the filmmakers had a stern Clarice Starling-style character in mind where she easily could have played a charismatic desk jockey who simply wasnt accustomed to field work. By contrast McCarthy easily disappears into her role to the extent that its tricky to distinguish where Mullins personality ends and the actresss begins. Where another script might have treated the gender dynamic strictly as subtext Dippold grapples the issue head-on conceiving multiple scenes in which Ashburn and Mullins must justify themselves to a hostile all-male workplace. In stakeout mode they quickly run afoul of two misogynist DEA agents (Dan Bakkedahl and Taran Killam) whose insults are trumped by the fact that one of them is albino -- perhaps the last minority unprotected by political correctness. Mullins doesnt take guff from anyone. In the office she retaliates against an unsupportive boss by conducting a hilarious humiliating search for his missing ""mouse balls."" And whenever shots are fired chances are shes aiming for the perps crotch. In addition to emasculating the standard buddy-cop cliches the film goes out of its way to de-objectify its two stars never stooping to that tacky slow-pan trick where the camera ogles the characters from the ground up while pole-dancing music sets the tone. In fact when it comes to the soundtrack music supervisor Randall Poster has assembled a lineup of funky high-attitude hip-hop tracks nearly all of them performed by women. By emphasizing both the humor and the empowerment aspects of the picture ""The Heat"" easily overcomes the occasional clunkiness along the way.

Paul Feig created Freaks and Geeks. He didnt get his ""big break"" directing it. You really need to fix that. Even interns at most publications are aware of his credits. He is a geek icon. Apatow was his younger colleague in the comedy clubs when they did stand-up. Calling him his mentor is also just really wrong. Reply Peter Debruge says June 27 2013 at 1231 pm Hi Jason We corrected the wording as quickly as possible. Certainly as creator of ""Freaks and Geeks"" Feig wouldnt appear to owe Apatow anything and yet on multiple occasions he has explained that Apatow was the champion who encouraged him to direct an episode of the show and the person who stood behind him on ""Bridesmaids.""

Daily Edition Login to download The Heat Film Review 1035 AM PDT 6/27/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Twentieth Century Fox Bullock and McCarthy duke it out verbally and physically in a formulaic but crowd-pleasing and very commercial comedy. TWITTER Paul Feigs comedy stars Sandra Bullock as an uptight FBI agent and Melissa McCarthy as a crass Boston street cop. ""Do you have to use that language?"" Sandra Bullocks uptight FBI agent complains after hearing one too many scatological blasts from the potty mouth of Melissa McCarthys Boston street cop. Well hell of course she does or there wouldnt be much life in The Heat an obediently formulaic hostile-buddy comedy that achieves all its mirthful mileage from the abrasively combative relationship between the two competitive women. The scripts simpleminded shenanigans notwithstanding the two stars sync up better than their characters do especially with some rough-and-tumble physical slapstick resulting in a crude low-brow audience-pleaser that will hit the funny bones of both performers fan bases and gain additional commercial traction as the most female-centric release of the summer. PHOTOS Melissa McCarthy Sandra Bullock Turn Up The Heat At New York Premiere McCarthy and director Paul Feig shared their big-screen breakthrough on Bridesmaids two summers ago while earlier this year the actress scored an equally big hit with the one-note Identity Thief. Disappointingly to those who might be expecting something more sophisticated from Feig The Heat is a lot closer to Identity Thief than to his own previous work in that it depends inordinately on the amusement value of McCarthy making a brash bad-ass spectacle of herself shoving people around telling them off bullying everyone in sight and generally using her bulk and bad attitude to get her way. The act is admittedly still funny but you can sometimes feel the strain to on the part of script writer Katie Dippold (TVs Parks and Recreation MadTV) to invent ever-more outrageous epithets for McCarthy to spew at everyone who gets in her way which is just about everyone. Whether youre a street punk her browbeaten supervisor or the fookin Queen of England it doesnt matter to her sartorially challenged detective Shannon Mullins who makes her first big impression by throwing a watermelon at a young black drug dealer. Initially this female Mack truck rolls right over Bullocks interloper Sarah Ashburn an overachieving straight arrow whos been sent from New York by the Feds to nail the same drug kingpin Shannon has been pursuing by targeting low-level dealers and thugs including her own brother (Michael Rapaport) whom she personally got thrown in the slammer. Sarahs promotion to a top bureau job depends on wrapping up this case but nothing she learned at Yale has prepared her for dealing with the likes of Shannon and her family a group a bickering Beantown blowhards that makes the working class clan in The Fighter look like candidates for the Social Register. VIDEO New Heat Clip Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy Show Off Dance Moves Feigs timing and editing rhythms feel off at the outset before the two women meet. But once Sarahs astonishment that such a woman as Shannon even exists morphs into an acceptance that shes going to have to co-exist with her somehow the two performers begin to click in ways that are amusing simply on the level of good shtick and a near-Three Stooges level of physical comedy. Particularly diverting in this vein are three extended set pieces A girls night of drinking thats loaded with gags and loosens Sarah up; a nightclub sequence in which Shannon transforms Sarahs prim suit into something sufficiently trashy for her to hit the dance floor and attract their sleazy suspect; and a pretty out-there jeopardy situation in which the only possible means of escape for the two bound women means somehow extracting the knife that a bad guy has plunged into Sarahs thigh muscle. Otherwise the attempts at comedy spring almost exclusively from degenerating every scene into a dispute. Shannon interprets nearly every situation as a personal affront as a red cape worthy of charging and one of the little life lessons tucked into the script is how Shannon needs to lay back and roll with things better. For her part Sarahs a know-it-all whose arrogance needs to be taken down a few pegs; shes forced to admit that she really has no friends and Shannon is perfectly happy to let her know why. PHOTOS Revenge of the Over-40 Actress 10 A-Listers Whose Clout (and Salaries) Are Skyrocketing Compared to Bridesmaids or even to last summers Boston-set surprise comedy hit Seth MacFarlanes Ted The Heat is awfully simplistic a collision of opposites that sets up obvious sitcommy standoffs shout-downs and physical pranks. As ever McCarthy is more than willing to let her weight be the butt as it were of embarrassing jokes as in a pretty funny scene in which she parks her old Rambler (perfect car casting) in too narrow a spot cant open the door wide enough and struggles desperately to get out. For her part Bullock loosens up after prolonged exposure to her rowdy co-star and becomes appealingly self-deprecating. Even though the characters reach a friendly rapprochement by the end surely all concerned will have no problem reigniting some friction between the pair to facilitate a sequel or two for this effective new comedy team.

Photo Gemma La Mana Twentieth Century Fox The Heat review Action comedy buddy pic in 1 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Heat Comedy. Starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. Directed by Paul Feig. (R. 117 minutes.) ""The Heat"" is a good movie and a successful action comedy and it arrives just in time for Melissa McCarthy. ""The Hangover III"" and ""Identity Thief"" cast her in nasty unfunny versions of the role she played in ""Bridesmaids"" and as actors inevitably get blamed for their bad material McCarthy was on the verge of looking like a one-trick pony whose trick wasnt all that funny after all. ""The Heat"" removes all doubt - McCarthy is a big-screen comedian for the long haul. The role is not so different from the confident mentally skewed crazily aggressive and slightly delusional women she has been playing in movies recently but this time the script doesnt leave her to flail and sell bad writing by being broad and pushy. It gives her scenes to act as well as laugh-out-loud lines and moments. It also gives her Sandra Bullock to play off of a comedian of equal skill but of completely different style and manner. The coming attractions trailer did this movie no favors. Often the trailer has all the laughs but this one left only the impression of another stupid uninspired formula movie. Actually ""The Heat"" is something of a formula comedy but its inspired too - and the inspiration is in the combining of these two actresses. If this were the old studio days the producers would force them to make another four or five movies together. As it stands it would be very surprising if they never co-starred in another movie The chemistry is too strong. McCarthy is a battering ram. Her style is to hit a joke as hard and as relentlessly as she can until the audience breaks down and laughs. Bullocks by contrast is the comedy of embarrassment the muttered line underneath the breath of someone trying to avoid conflict and maintain appearances. So these are comic personae designed to clash - and the rest is just filling in the blanks finding the characters and creating the opportunities. A nice feature of Katie Dippolds script is that the crime story that goes with the comedy isnt bad on its own. Bullock plays Sarah a know-it-all ambitious FBI agent who goes to Boston to find a drug kingpin and McCarthy is Mullins a plainclothes detective who questions a witness by hitting him with a phone book and forcing him to play Russian roulette. Of course Sarah and Mullins dont want to work together but surprisingly the movie actually gets better when their more blatant clashes are out of the way and theyre getting along while getting on each others nerves. The humor is harsh coarse and very funny and Paul Feig who directed ""Bridesmaids"" once again demonstrates his ability to create an atmosphere of abandon so that a running joke about a misogynistic albino DEA agent can go right to the line without crossing it. Yet theres work behind the abandon. Feig refines the comic beats and delineates the featured roles so that theyre vivid. The bad guys here dont just scowl but have specific points of character. Heres a mark of how well ""The Heat"" works how it never becomes boring The movie contains a fairly long set-piece about an hour in in which the two women get drunk in a bar and then start dancing and then dancing with other people. They end up sleeping at the bar. In terms of story the sequence could almost be cut entirely but its one of the most delightful things in the movie. Thats how at home the audience gradually gets with just watching Bullock and McCarthy being funny together. Two more things to look for The Mullins clan a crazy Boston family seems partly inspired by the crazy Boston family in David O. Russells ""The Fighter."" Those are good ensemble scenes that show Feigs command of a crowd. Also on two or three occasions Sarahs high school yearbook is shown and the date on it says 1982. That means that Sarah is at least 48 going on 49 which is exactly Bullocks age. Do you think something like that could possibly happen onscreen without a major stars knowledge and approval? Good for Bullock to be playing her own age onscreen and for showing people what 48 looks like or at least the movie-star version of it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

A few weeks ago the writers of ""Superbad"" scored an entertaining and even occasionally ambitious directorial debut with ""This is the End"" and now ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig scores once more outside the fold with ""The Heat"" a gloriously foul-mouthed buddy-cop comedy. Also read Melissa McCarthy Breaks Silence on Controversial Rex Reed Review Reteaming with his game-for-anything ""Bridesmaids"" star Melissa McCarthy and adding the particularly prickly screen persona of Sandra Bullock to the mix Feig and screenwriter Katie Dippold (a TV vet making her big-screen debut) take this venerable genre - starting with 1970s-flavored opening credits that feature the Isley Brothers ""Fight the Power"" - and use it as a way to play to both actresses strengths. See video The Heats Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock Get Their Drink on in New Clip Those so inclined map out how the script beats resemble those of ""48 Hrs."" ""Freebie and the Bean"" and any number of other predecessors but I was too busy laughing; unlike so many comedies that are funny enough with a decent joke every few minutes to keep you seated ""The Heat"" features lots of big laughs in almost every scene of its nearly two-hour running time. FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn (Bullock) is exceedingly competent at her job. Shes intelligent intuitive a polyglot whos up on the latest criminological and psychological advancements ... and utterly incapable of relating to other people. Friendless loveless and resented around the office she wants desperately to get a promotion; her boss (Demian Bichir ""A Better Life"") needs Sarah to prove she can play well with others so he sends her off to Boston to track down a nefarious drug kingpin. See video The Heats Sandra Bullock Chelsea Handler Revisit Their Naked Shower Encounter Its in Beantown where Sarah crosses paths with local cop Shannon Mullins (McCarthy) and its hate at first sight. Mullins works the streets of her own neighborhood in a uniquely abrasive way that has even her superiors cowering in fear from her and sloppy Shannon is pretty much the polar-opposite of by-the-book Sarah the latter with her sad little side hairpin and her drab pantsuits that might as well say ""NARC."" (Or as Shannons brothers the battlin-est Boston family this side of ""The Fighter"" might say ""NAHK."") But wouldnt you know it these diametrically opposed lawpersons must come together for a shared cause and find common ground and bond a little and so on and so forth. Neither woman has any friends or love life to speak of although the string of crestfallen men whom Shannon awkwardly encounters throughout suggests that she gives one hell of a one-night stand. Still both Sarah and Shannon know a lot more about firearms (Shannon keeps hers in an emptied-out fridge) than they do about their own hearts or anyone elses. Also read Paul Feig Developing Female James Bond Comedy Susan Cooper Dippold takes this oh-so-familiar framework and uses it as the foundation for a torrent of insults quirky character observations workplace sexism and one-liners that absolutely cannot be repeated on a safe-for-work website. McCarthy as ever shines here; after being the best thing about two terrible movies this year (""Identity Thief"" and ""The Hangover Part III"") she finally gets a vehicle that deserves her. She knows how to use her sizable figure to get laughs without ever making herself the object of ridicule and she matches her physical prowess with a genius for verbal comedy. Looking back at Sandra Bullocks career it appears that shes at her best when shes got a co-star who keeps her on her toes and demands that she perform at a certain level; in any event McCarthy brings out the Oscar-winners best. Her ability to make Sarah never swear - until awkwardly all those backed-up four-letter words come pouring out - is a treat to behold. As Feig often does in his films going all the way back to his underappreciated ""Unaccompanied Minors"" he casts comedians in many of the roles often in places you wouldnt expect. Probably no other filmmaker would cast Michael McDonald of ""Mad TV"" as a vicious drug lord with a knife fetish but Feig does and McDonald is suitably creepy in the role. Also turning up are Tony Hale (""Arrested Development"") Taran Killam and Jane Curtin of ""SNL"" Zach Woods (""The Office"") ""Bridesmaids"" vets Mitch Silpa and Ben Falcone and perhaps most surprisingly former New Kid on the Block Joey McIntyre as one of Shannons Southie sibs. ""The Heat"" isnt much to look at with its muddy cinematography and harsh lighting but what it lacks in appearance it more than makes up for in comedy. There probably wont be a funnier movie this year that features female bonding drunken dancing grenade launchers and a seriously botched emergency tracheotomy. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"The Heat movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Heat Bullock McCarthy salvage buddy movie June 28 2013|Michael Phillips | Movie criticR; 157 running time With so few women afforded the opportunity to steer the course of a movie -- any movie on screen or off -- even a formulaic vehicle such as ""The Heat"" arrives as a surprise and a relief. Read the full ""The Heat"" movie review (Handout)With so few women afforded the opportunity to steer the course of a movie -- any movie on screen or off -- even a formulaic vehicle such as ""The Heat"" arrives as a surprise and a relief.At its sharpest ""The Heat"" actually moves and banters like a comedy with sharply timed and edited dialogue sequences driven by a couple of pros ensuring a purposeful sense of momentum. The story places Sandra Bullock playing a fastidious FBI agent as an opposing force to Melissa McCarthys brazen Boston cop. Mostly theyre funny because of the material; elsewhere theyre funny in spite of it.The good stuffs in the first 80 minutes. Screenwriter Katie Dippold (""MADtv"" ""Parks and Recreation"") and director Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"" and plenty of good television series before that) eventually settle for action-movie cliches and locales (oh that old abandoned warehouse full of venal criminal scum) without a fresh take.The violence in the final third becomes a drag. One of these days well get a buddy-cop lark with the nerve to tone down the sadism; here its a threatened-torture scene following an emergency tracheotomy performed at a Dennys. And product placement has gotten pretty strange at the movies lately. Between the pulverized IHOP in ""Man of Steel"" and the blood-spattered Dennys in ""The Heat"" its like How bout eating in tonight?But we must appreciate the payoffs where we find them. Bullock has been hereabouts before in ""Miss Congeniality"" but this is one of her best recent performances full of pinpoint details and quirks. McCarthy already an audience favorite thanks to ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Identity Thief"" is learning to modulate her act and find variations on the theme of volcanic bully. She was born in all probability with the ability to slay an audience and detonate a punch line. But shes actress enough to learn the value of variety within a comfortable persona.In ""The Heat"" were closer to full-on action mode akin to ""48 Hrs."" or ""Lethal Weapon"" territory than a spoofy affair on the order of the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg movie ""The Other Guys."" Bullocks New York-based agent is bucking for a promotion. She travels to Boston to nail a drug lord. (Were done with the plot now even if the film takes a full two hours to deal with it.) McCarthys the tetchy local blowhard with a badge a woman tough enough to put her own brother behind bars. As this odd couple learn to work together the audience learns to forgive the scenes that dont quite work (an undercover assignment in a nightclub where Bullocks character must fake skankiness) and swing with those that do (typically the off-plot riffs allowing the actresses some breathing room).A couple of examples of scenes that work? At one point McCarthy bounces a little plastic Tic Tac box off her police chiefs noggin and the way director Feig films it -- calmly without undue emphasis -- makes the gag even more successful. At another point Bullock and McCarthy are in the frenemy stage of their working relationship and McCarthy caps some fib or another with the line ""America thanks you."" Bullocks reply ""And I it."" Most buddy-cop movies whether their focus is on explosions and stabbings or in this case explosions and stabbings plus some jokes have zero facility when it comes to verbal flourishes along these lines. ""The Heat"" may overstay its welcome (a contractual obligation in Hollywood comedies these days) but I suspect audiences will take to it.There. That takes care of the industrys semiannual investment in the ""other"" gender. Now we can get back to ""The Hangover 4 Whatever.""mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for pervasive language strong crude content and some violence)Running time 157Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesCinemaCon ""Heat"" director Paul Feig says Boston can get...April 17 2013The Heat Helmer Paul Feig Gets Honest LaughsJune 13 2013Sandra Bullock circles Annie at SonyJune 12 2013Tony Hale set for Paul Feig comedy Actor joins Bullock...July 9 2012FilmDistrict pegs Dead Man for April 5 Thriller faces U...June 21 2012Find More Stories AboutSandra BullockOdd CoupleMelissa MccarthyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0626-heat-20130628,0,532264.column",200,theheat33,theheat,chicagotribune

(Gemma La Mana) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday June 27 2013 1200 PM Title The Heat Film Info R Strong language violence. Area theaters. Paul Feigs cliched but often very funny comedy ""The Heat"" would be a fairly ordinary entry in the female buddy cop genre except ... there is no genre yet. Happily Melissa McCarthy may single-handedly change that. Its amazing that by 2013 there have never been two women paired together in this kind of comedy. Then again Hollywood often lags several decades behind. It takes money to push this industry ahead and if ""The Heat"" is a hit we ought to see more of its kind. That said theres nothing else new about Katie Dippolds script which -- aside from the now-requisite jokes about ladyparts -- feels like a retread of countless movies to come before it. Thank heavens then for the vastly talented McCarthy. She gives the film a riotous improvisatory wildness its otherwise lacking. McCarthys gruff Detective Mullins is a take-no-prisoners cop on the meanest streets of Boston. Shes not in other words the type to welcome uptight FBI agent Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) who arrives to investigate a local druglord. Ashburn always plays by the book while Mullins is more likely to tear all the pages out and stuff them down a perps throat. Id like to say there are some surprises in this mismatched pairing but if youve seen any ""Lethal Weapon"" you know just how it goes. The primary additions unfortunately are some surprisingly nasty cracks about aging or single ladies and the choreographed song-and-dance number apparently required by studios when two or more actresses get together. Mullins and Ashburn are law enforcement officers who adopt strange tactics to nab their quarry. (Gemma La Mana) The subplots about Ashburns cute co-worker (Marlon Wayans) and Mullins nutty family (including Michael Rapaport and Jane Curtin) seem like padding in a movie thats at least 20 minutes too long. But if Dippolds script and Feigs direction are disappointingly predictable McCarthy -- who did similarly great work with Feig in his much better ""Bridesmaids"" -- doesnt appear to notice. Even as Bullock recycles a comedy of incompetence that felt tired by ""Miss Congeniality 2"" McCarthy approaches this project like its a creative masterpiece. Every foul-mouthed joke she cracks every unexpected physical gag she underplays is so funny you forget how often weve seen this setup. Or when it comes to women how rarely. Right now McCarthy is one of very few actresses allowed to carry a film and the only one who doesnt look photoshopped. But if shes bearing any burdens as a pioneer youd never know it. As far as we can see shes just having a great time -- and doing absolutely everything possible to make sure we are too. eweitzmannydailynews.com On mobile?

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Gemma La Mana) Gemma La Mana This film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox shows Sandra Bullock as FBI Special Agent Sarah Ashburn left and Melissa McCarthy as Boston Detective Shannon Mullins in a scene from ""The Heat."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Gemma La Mana) You have the right to remain skeptical about Melissa McCarthy. ""Identity Thief"" was a serious offense and she was too-easily pardoned for stealing scenes in ""Bridesmaids"" with felonious flatulence. But the multiplex is a prison thats starved for female protagonists and a big loud woman with physical agility can get away with murder if shes got the right partner in crime.Whereas Jason Bateman was inert in ""Identity Thief"" Sandra Bullock has combustible chemistry with McCarthy in ""The Heat."" Directed by Paul Feig of ""Bridesmaids"" and written by Katie Dippold of the TV series ""Parks and Recreation"" its a buddy-cop comedy that deserves to share a locker room with ""The Other Guys"" and ""21 Jump Street.""Notwithstanding McCarthys rising popularity and Bullocks long track record in romps such as ""Miss Congeniality"" successful comedy relies on writers and Dippold is a good one. She worked on ""MadTV"" a sketch-comedy show that was consistently funnier than ""Saturday Night Live"" not least because it knew how to end a routine without simply cutting to commercial. But ""The Heat"" is driven by dialogue not plot. When fussbudget FBI agent Sarah Ashburn (Bullock) is sent to Boston to crack a cocaine ring she butts heads with bullish local detective Shannon Mullins (McCarthy). While opposing temperaments are the building blocks of buddy flicks its relatively rare that the bickering frenemies are female. And its even rarer that they get to cuss like sailors and kick butt like soldiers.McCarthy does most of the politically incorrect swearing and shooting but Bullock makes an effective foil and when she lets her hair down as in a barroom bury-the-hatchet scene shes a riot. Theres also a strong supporting cast of comedy veterans including Michael Rapaport as the drug-dealing brother that Mullins sent to prison Jane Curtin as the fall-mouthed mother whos never forgiven her and Nate Corddry as a brother who tells her how to park the car in Harvard Yard. Of special note is Dan Bakkedahl as a DEA agent who is the subject of recurring insults about albinism which are already generating some pallid protests. Like the judge in Critics Court might say let this be a lesson in blind justice. After watching the trailers I was expecting torture but this smart subversive movie made me laugh.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Ostensibly Kristen Wiigs show to steal Bridesmaids found standout moments for just about everyone in its cast. Thats not the case with Paul Feigs follow-up The Heat an unevenly matched buddy-cop comedy that amounts to a feature-length showcase for Melissa McCarthy riffing. But the humor value of that prospect should not be underestimated. As an unflappable Boston cop with a flagrant disregard for protocol (and due process?) shes introduced busting a john by grabbing his cell phone and dialing his wife. The non sequiturs keep coming Informed by her superior shell have to defer to Sandra Bullocks FBI stiff whos taking over the case she starts sifting through his office. (""Shes looking for my balls"" he explains to Bullock.) Upon finding out what an overpriced whiskey will cost her she replies ""Is it served in Jesus shoe?"" Itd be possible to watch a whole movie of outtakes like this and frankly thats what much of The Heat resembles. The logic used to team a street-level officer with a relentlessly by-the-book federal agent is flimsy at best so its a buzzkill whenever the film (written by Parks And Recreation vet Katie Dippold) takes a time-out from its inspired randomness to attend to a half-assed drug-bust plot. Part of the point here is to stake a claim on a genre thats traditionally been a boys club and in that regard The Heat delivers In a bonding moment this odd couple goes on a bender as epic as anything in The Hangover. Their enthusiasm with weapons should alarm viewers across all demographics and species. Meanwhile the movie struggles to get laughs from anyone other than McCarthy. Bullock is adequate as a foil but her task is to play it straight while some of the peripheral gags (Dan Bakkedahl turning up as a sexist albino DEA agent; Boston-accent jokes involving McCarthys family headed by an underused Jane Curtin) play like fallback material. Is a less patchy version of The Heat imaginable? At just shy of two hours it could stand to pick up the pace. The movie packs heat but not momentum.
