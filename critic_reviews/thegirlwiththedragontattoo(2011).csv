Columbia Pictures Lets cut to the crucial question How is the new girl in David Finchers version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""? Shes fine thank you very much. That is to say Rooney Mara looks just as bizarre as Noomi Rapace did in the role of Lisbeth Salander the poster girl for punk and spunk in the Swedish-language trilogy. And she cuts just as striking a figure riding a motorcycle surfing the web or taking and giving terrible punishment. But theres a crucial difference. Lisbeth 1 was black-light incandescence burning with focused anger. Lisbeth 2 is recessive haunted sometimes bummed and occasionally blank but clearly alienated from the vile world in which Lisbeth 1 fiercely claimed her place. That may leave fans of the original feeling alienated too not only from Lisbeth but from the spectacle of a remake that has much to recommend it--high-end craftsmanship a singular heroine a labyrinthine mystery an intriguing milieu--yet lacks a vital spark. Fans of the original are not to be sure the remakes main target audience. Americans dont turn out in massive numbers for foreign-language films even when theyre as popular as this one was. So theres plenty of pent-up curiosity about Lisbeth one of the most original figures in movie history as well as standing demand for well-made thrillers of which this is one. (Steven Zaillian adapted the screenplay from the Stieg Larsson novel. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did the powerful score.) Watch a clip from the film ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" based on the best selling novel and directed by David Fincher. Video courtesy Columbia Pictures. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a sharp departure from Mr. Finchers previous film ""The Social Network"" in the preface of which Ms. Maras Erica fought a spirited verbal duel with Jesse Eisenbergs Mark. The new films plot centers on an antisocial network a Swedish family with a history of Fascist leanings that holds the secret to the fate of a young woman who disappeared 40 years ago. Daniel Craig is Mikael Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who teams up with Lisbeth to investigate the extremely cold case and uncovers more corruption than either of them bargained for. A cool actor turned chilly in the Scandinavian winter Mr. Craig nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikaels impassive affect. Christopher Plummer is the familys smoothly expansive plutocrat. Stellan Skarsgard puts another construction on smoothness as one of its least savory members. Yet the film is no departure at all from such earlier Fincher films as ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" since it involves as they did acts of ghastly violence committed under grisly circumstances. Jeff Cronenweths cinematography does lustrous variations on the darkness the director favors; Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack. One script change warrants discussion--I wont discuss it because I wont divulge it--but most of the film follows the original sometimes shot for shot. Its certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it however theres no way of unseeing it and nothing in the new one to top it. The Adventures of Tintin Watch a clip from the new animated feature ""The Adventures of Tintin"" directed by Steven Spielberg. Video courtesy Paramount Pictures. Its easy to see what the boy in Steven Spielberg saw in the Belgian comic books that led to this 3-D animated action adventure--a boy reporter in a simpler era throwing himself into globe-girdling exploits. Spielberg the man seized on the Herge series which ran from 1929 to 1983 as a chance to work with animation for the first time. (And to join forces with another Herge fan Peter Jackson who served as producer.) What the two filmmakers plus a small army of artists and technicians have wrought of these tales is appealingly earnest at first and charmingly innocent of the glib hip that pollutes so many cartoon features. The motion-capture animation is spectacular a float planes crash landing on a desert; motorcyclists on a wild chase after a falcon in flight; a dam break; a flood; dueling cargo cranes dueling duelists. Yet the action grows wearisome as it grinds on and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings. ENLARGE Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and Tintin (Jamie Bell) in The Adventures of Tintin. Paramount Pictures Jamie Bell is the voice of Tintin a swoop-haired youngster of indeterminate age who is always accompanied by his dog Snowy. Andy Serkis is Captain Haddock Tintins boozy companion on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship. Daniel Craig free of Mikael Blomkvists restraint is the extravagantly vocal villain Sakharine. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" has opened in the U.S. without a huge marketing push after debuting in Europe where the comic books have long been popular and where the film has been doing big business. It will be fascinating to see whether audiences here respond to its curious mix of old-fashioned hero and new-fangled technology. A preteen girl sitting next to me at a screening was literally leaping out of her seat during the action sequences but her parents may have been studio executives. Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close ENLARGE Max von Sydow and Thomas Horn in Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close. Warner Bros. Pictures Ive heard people say they werent sure even a decade after Sept. 11 if they could handle this film about a boy whose beloved father has recently died in one of the twin towers. I know what they mean. Almost half a century after Dallas I still have trouble watching film of President Kennedys assassination. Yet Stephen Daldrys screen version of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel adapted by Eric Roth proves hard to handle for other reasons. The productions penchant for contrivance is insufferable--not a single spontaneous moment from start to finish--and the boy is so precocious you want to strangle him. Its surely not the fault of Thomas Horn the remarkable young man who plays him. In widely seen clips from his winning appearance on ""Teen Jeopardy"" Thomas was thoughtful articulate and poised beyond his years. That must have made him seem like a natural for the role of Oskar Schell who may or may not have Aspergers syndrome and who outdoes any of J.D. Salingers gifted kids in richness of vocabulary and complexity of ideas. Watch a clip from the film ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock. Video courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. But Oskar in print is one thing. As you read the book (which I also disliked) you are tracking at your own pace the workings of the boys mind--and the pain in his heart--as he searches New York City for a lock that matches a key his father has left behind. Its quite another thing to watch Oskar on the screen with no respite from his shrill voice or his mannered behavior. A less remarkable actor--or Thomas himself directed for simplicity--might have taken the curse off the movies case of the terminal cutes. Mr. Daldry however chose to push his young star in the opposite direction toward a totality of artifice that dilutes the impact of Sept. 11 and underscores the blissed-out illogic of Oskars quest. Sandra Bullock is Oskars griefstruck mother Linda and Tom Hanks is his father Thomas. In flashbacks father and son express their special relationship with such relentlessly abstruse conversations that you long for one or the other to say something like ""Lets have scrambled eggs."" Max von Sydow gives a lively performance as The Renter a mysterious mute. In another film his silence might be golden. In this one it goes platinum. Watch a clip from the new film ""We Bought a Zoo"" starring Matt Damon. We Bought a Zoo Matt Damon stars in and gracefully carries Cameron Crowes family film about a widower who gives his two kids a new life by buying a rural house that comes with a zoo. Its really an achievement when you stop to think of it for Mr. Damon to switch from tough-as-nails Jason Bourne to tender-hearted Benjamin Mee but he makes the transition look effortless. A good thing too because the production has been constructed effortfully from notions and elements that hang together fairly loosely. ENLARGE Matt Damon in We Bought a Zoo. Twentieth Century Fox The zoo and its animals seldom transcend the status of props; its hardly helpful when Benjamin notes that ""the sellers say you dont even need any special knowledge to run a zoo; what you need is a lot of heart."" Dont tell that to the animal-rights people whove been calling attention to the foolish line and dont expect to be overly impressed by the expertise of Kelly the zookeeper who is played by Scarlett Johansson. (Or by her performance which at times seems uncertain.) What holds the film together is its genuine sense of family--Benjamins daughter is played delightfully by Maggie Elizabeth Jones and his son by Colin Ford--and Mr. Damons portrayal of a loving father moving beyond the grief of losing his wife. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a movie you want to like and a movie you can enjoy if you cut its slackness some slack. DVD Focus ENLARGE Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig isnt just acceptable but formidable as a newly minted James Bond. Hes at least the equal of the best ones before him and beats all of them in sheer intensity. The English star (he became one as soon as the movie opened) makes physicality exciting emotional detachment interesting and stirrings of tenderness affecting. This chapter of the Bond saga set forth as a prequel was directed by Martin Campbell. Mads Mikkelsen is the villainous banker Le Chiffre. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd a lissome British treasury official and emotional chameleon. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) Matt Damon gives a remarkable performance as the mild-mannered bespectacled and murderous Tom Ripley. The year is 1958 and the place is Italy where rich young Americans play expatriate games aboard yachts on azure seas or dart through ancient hill towns on sputtering Vespas and Lambrettas. But Tom who is poor cant acknowledge his hearts true desire to Jude Laws fragrantly decadent playboy Dickie Greenleaf. Tom yearns to be Dickie Greenleaf and he will be before the end of this lush if overlong thriller which the late Anthony Minghella directed from his adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths novel. Billy Elliot (2000) Stephen Daldrys debut feature is a piece of flagrant feelgoodism thats saved by a Bell--Jamie Bell in the title role. Elevenyear-old Billy was born to dance. More remarkably for a working-class child born to dance classical ballet though he doesnt know it until he goes to his weekly boxing lesson and comes upon a ballet class in the same building. His dancing teacher is played by the splendid Julie Walters and its nice to see the two working off one another the cigarette-smoking dame and the impish slip of a boy with a shining future Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

I felt it last month when I initially saw the American film version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo the first in the bestselling Millennium trilogy by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson. On second viewing I still feel a letdown. How could I not? David Fincher the director of a handful of films I revere from Fight Club Seven Panic Room and Zodiac to last years masterful The Social Network is at the helm. From him expectations are high for a transgressive take on the books search for a serial killer of women. From him we get - what? - a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Fincher chose well in Rooney Mara (shes unforgettable dumping Jesse Eisenbergs Mark Zuckerberg in the opening scene of The Social Network). Mara is astonishing as Lisbeth Salander the pierced bisexual tattooed twentysomething hacker who teams up with journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a curiously wan Daniel Craig) to unearth secrets in the family of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) an industrialist who thinks his grandniece Harriet was murdered 40 years ago. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth capture the chill of Vangers private island and the despicable family tree of Nazis killers and incestuous pervs. Unlike the juicy pulp of Niels Arden Oplevs 2009 Swedish adaptation with a fierce Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Finchers Girl is elegantly austere as though the material merited an artful gaze instead of crass energy. Girl moves in fits and starts as if screenwriter Steve Zaillian felt no minor character unworthy of a share in the films two hours and 40 minutes. Though the actors give their all notably Stellan Skarsgard as the brother of the missing Harriet and Joely Richardson as an estranged relative the film hangs back when you want it to come out swinging. Only Mara lets it bleed. Her defensive bruised-animal performance inexorably draws you in. Lisbeth is a hunter of male predators and her takedown of her rapist guardian (Yorick van Wageningen) is justifiably graphic. But what pulls her toward Mikael? Craigs distant self-amused performance offers no clues. Editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall excel at crosscutting between Lisbeth and Mikael separately investigating the case with orgasmic relish. But when the two hook up in Mikaels cabin and Lisbeth strips to jump his bones the expected sparks - sexual and soulful - never materialize. The thrumming score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross along with a slashing opening-credit scene in which Reznor and Karen O rework Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" promise a fire the film fails to stoke. Even the altered ending gives no offense. Finchers Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark.

The central mystery is finally solved after more than two hours in a thrilling fashion -- but instead of ending the movie returns to the lives and loves of its characters for another 20 minutes intent on wrapping up loose ends that we werent aware existed. I assume this is done out of faithfulness to Stieg Larssons novel and maybe the bond between journalist and computer hacker is more resonant in print. On film it feels very much beside the point or at least it has both times so far. Maybe the third adaptation of this book if there is one will make the pairs personal connection feel plausible. When its dealing with the crime investigation and Lisbeths harrowing ongoing battle with a corrupt social worker Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo works well enough. Its a cold mechanical procedural at heart which makes a perfectionist like Fincher (Seven The Social Network) a good choice to direct it. He and veteran screenwriter Steven Zaillian (Moneyball Schindlers List) wisely retained the desolate Swedish setting which not only avoids outraging the books fans but is the perfect location anyway for a story about such frigid people. High-profile Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has just suffered a public disgracing when hes recruited by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) the head of a wealthy industrialist family to investigate the 1966 disappearance and presumed murder of his great-niece. The girl Harriet was a teenager at the time and the killer has been taunting Henrik by sending tokens whose meaning only Henrik and the other Vangers could know. Whoever did away with Harriet must be a relative. There are plenty of suspects as nearly every member of this venal family is despicable and holds some icy grudge or other against someone else. Many of them live in separate houses on a small island near the town of Hedestad and it is here that Mikael comes to investigate. He pores over the evidence gathered by police 40 years ago applying a fresh perspective and the mind of a journalist to it while simultaneously getting away from his professional scandals back in the city. Meanwhile only tangentially connected to all of this there is 23-year-old Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) a pale skeletal computer hacker adorned with the kinds of tattoos and piercings that make you afraid of her when you see her on the subway. She makes a living doing thorough (and I mean thorough) background checks on people for clients who are happy to look the other way if she does something illegal like hack into the subjects email. Her childhood evidently filled with horrific trauma Lisbeth was a ward of the state in her teen years and continues to be supervised by government agencies. She no longer tolerates being victimized however. Lisbeths past experiences and present expertise make her suitable for the job of helping Mikael find out who killed teenage Harriet. The film is half over before they join forces and when they do there is some uncertainty about whether their relationship will remain strictly professional. (OK maybe not that much uncertainty.) But beyond that theres nothing compelling about their partnership. The characters are intriguing separately but their relationship to each other is no more interesting than the one between the two lead cops in a Law amp; Order episode and its fraught with a lot more implausibility. Mikael and Lisbeth are barely believable as a professional duo let alone a personal one. Whatever Craig and Mara needed to do chemistry-wise to make this partnership work it didnt happen. Still the Harriet mystery growing deeper and more gruesome as new facts come to light is whatever youd call the movie equivalent of a page-turner. Stellan Skarsgard Steven Berkoff Geraldine James and Joely Richardson shine in supporting roles as Vangers and Vanger associates. (Robin Wright is wasted as Mikaels editor and lover.) A viewer who hasnt read the book or seen the other movie -- i.e. who doesnt already know whats going to happen -- will no doubt find the storys whodunit aspect satisfying. But while this is clearly a David Fincher creation with the images meticulously composed the violence shocking but clinical and the Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross musical score suitably dispassionate the director never finds a way to make it his own. Making a film based on a recent book thats already been adapted once puts the fiercely independent Fincher in the position of having to convince viewers that his heart is truly in this that hes not doing it as a favor to the studio or out of some contractual obligation. What he has delivered is adequate but it doesnt have any flavor -- and of all the things Fincher is ""bland"" is not usually one of them.

Comments (6) click to enlarge The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Rated R  158 minutes  2011 David Finchers adaptation of the international best-seller is a triumph of craftsmanship over material. Though Steven Zallians screenplay preserves the ugly details and underlying puritanism of Stieg Larssons mystery novel Fincher directs as if this were the sequel to The Social Network what register most strongly are the caffeinated pacing and pristine impenetrable surfaces. The protagonist--a famous magazine reporter (Daniel Craig) and a goth-styled computer hacker (Rooney Mara)--solve much of the mystery through research. The task of dramatizing this proved too difficult for Niels Arden Oplev when he directed a Swedish adaptation in 2009 but as Fincher demonstrated in Social Network he knows how to make information technology eerily seductive. Unfortunately Larssons salacious plot elements--mass murder Nazism and the like--feel just as shallow as they did in the earlier version. With Christopher Plummer.

Hoberman Spielberg and Fincher Taming Creatures Wednesday December 21 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Consummate technicians with bankable interests and personal trademarks Steven Spielberg and David Fincher are something more than auteurs but also something less--closer to skilled craftsmen than creative artists.Spielbergs War Horse and Finchers Girl With the Dragon Tattoo prestige adaptations both are quintessential additions to their directors respective bestiaries. The tattooed Girl might make for a more compelling protagonist than the martyred Horse (and its devoted Boy) but both of these doggedly overwrought productions seem less felt than facile essentially uninvolving--except perhaps as logistical exercises.It might be perverse to accuse a tearjerker as accomplished as Steven Spielberg of being unfeeling. But the overcalculation with which he mechanically trots out one of his most familiar tropes for what amounts to a generic Disney animal story seems to preclude any but the most hackneyed emotion. What catastrophe cannot be Spielbergized? No less than Schindlers List Saving Private Ryan and (more entertainingly) War of the Worlds War Horse finds the silver lining of individual salvation in one of modern historys darkest thunderclouds--namely the wholesale pointless slaughter of World War I. Millions die but . . . you dont need me to tell you how this massive capital investment ends.Opening on Christmas Day War Horse is hardly without ambition. As the English country lad Albert (Jeremy Irvine) bonds with the beloved half-Thoroughbred steed he has named Joey and once the horse is conscripted by the British army follows him into the hellish vortex of Flanders Field Spielberg seeks to represent the horror of modern combat in human (or at least mammalian) terms. But since hes a director largely incapable of understatement War Horse is served up with a self-aggrandizing distracting surplus of Norman Rockwell backlighting aerial landscape shots designed to out-swoop David Leans and an aggravated sense of doggone wonderment amplified by the directors dependence on John Williamss bombastic score. Dialogue is superfluous; in its way War Horse is as much a ""silent movie"" as The Artist. Every triumph is pounded into your head and punctuated by a dolly-in close-up.""Who is this movie for?"" a colleague muttered shortly before bailing. War Horse is based on Michael Morpurgos 1982 young-adult novel itself the basis for the National Theatre of Great Britains virtuoso multiple-Tony-winning fearfully expensive puppet show. I found the play brilliantly staged and dramatically inert and as written by Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and Richard Curtis (Bridget Joness Diary) the cinematic War Horse is even more simpleminded and inspirational than the stage production eliminating or smoothing over its major conflicts--as when improving the character of Alberts feckless father (Peter Mullan) no longer a coward but an unappreciated war hero who purchases Joey in a fit of drunken bravado directed not against his more successful brother but a greedy landlord. (The play War Horse derives its power from its abstract ""life-like"" puppets. Here the horse isnt anthropomorphized so much as the humans are notably the hyper-animated French grandpa played by Niels Arestrup as if auditioning to understudy one of Snow Whites adorable lil curmudgeons.)Being a movie Spielbergs War Horse is inevitably more graphic than the show--though its battlefield scenes are far less gory than Private Ryans stunning D-Day overture. The run-up to war affords the director some spectacular flourishes even as it broadens Joeys horizons. The horse is purchased by a friendly officer meets and bonds with another stallion Topthorne and leads a surprise cavalry attack on the Germans an exciting rout that like several other moments suggests Spielberg should make a real horse opera. Joey is the first-person narrator of Morpurgos novel. The movie doesnt go that far but it tracks the horse through his own war--several times captured by and escaping from the Germans as he is used to pull field ambulances or haul artillery. Meanwhile Albert is in the trenches still babbling about his lost Joey as he and his comrades go over the top.Following a dumb brute on its arduous journey from master to master (most of whom perish) War Horse has an unavoidable similarity to Robert Bressons sublime Au hasard Balthazar. Indeed the sequence in which Joey--like Bressons donkey--is adopted by a willful unlovable French peasant girl suggests the parallel might have occurred to Spielberg. The difference is not solely a matter of Bressons ascetic restraint and Spielbergs shameless schmaltz or Bressons tragic sense of life and Spielbergs unswerving belief in the happy ending. Suffering witness to all manner of enigmatic human behavior Balthazar is pure existence; Joey is an abstraction. Had Spielberg elected to show war (or life) from Joeys perspective rather than use the horse as the wars protagonist the movie could have been truly terrifying. Instead its most impressive passage is pure digital delirium as an animated Joey runs free across the CGI battlefield jumps over trenches rears up under the full moon pulls down the barbed wire and collapses in no-mans-land.That Joey Uniting doughboys and officers children and adults the Brits and the Bosch mending broken hearts and restoring eyesight to the blind this indomitable horse does not reproach humanity. Embodying what his creators take to be our best most selfless and enduring instincts he justifies it.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is hardly a personal project. Still David Finchers sveltely malevolent remake of the 2009 Swedish blockbuster directed by Niels Arden Oplev from Stieg Larssons rambling thriller a posthumously published international bestseller and Kindle record-holder is a recognizably Fincherian caper. The movie which opens with a bit of Led Zeppelin grandiosity (covered by Karen O) and a credit sequence of scary satanic rubber- fetish ickiness has a pleasingly dialectical place in the Fincher oeuvre synthesizing aspects of his previous two features the serial-killer procedural Zodiac and the computer-nerd biopic The Social Network.Set in a freeze-your-blood land of streamlined chrome steely dawns and gleaming black-and-silver nocturnes The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo follows a cold trail of ritually butchered women through rural Sweden; these previously unlinked crimes have been discovered as part of an investigation conducted by lefty reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). This grim do-gooders career was earlier upended by the billionaire corporate crook whom his reporting failed to bring down and he has been hired on the rebound by another Swedish oligarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer channeling Max von Sydow) to solve a murder.Beggaring the Kennedy assassination or the crime at the heart of Blow-Up in its wealth of photographic evidence this killing was committed some 45 years ago apparently by one Vanger family member against another. Alternately dashed and dashing Blomkvist is a standard-issue wounded crusader but as millions of earthlings know the movies real protagonist is his ace research assistant Lisbeth Salander. The eponymous asocial goth-punk-pierced-lesbo hacker supreme shes played here by neophyte Rooney Mara best known until now as the Boston University co-ed who called Mark Zuckerberg an asshole five minutes into The Social Network and its her pale flame that illuminates the movie.Steven Zaillians script pushes Larssons narrative originally set at the close of the 20th century toward the present moment. Its a bit late in the day to take seriously the guilty secret of Swedens Nazi sympathizers but amateur torture theater is a perennial movie kick. The novel (originally and pointedly titled Men Who Hate Women by its Trotskyist author) is basically a tale about brutalized females and a fantasy of feminist retaliation. Fincher gets with the program as when Salander handily dispatches a mugger or after being grossly abused by her sadistic legal guardian coolly stages a counter rape of absolute vengeance and then goes out clubbing. (Still as a polished professional and an equal-opportunity entertainer the director--once down in the basement of terror--cant help but dote a bit on the male pathology Larsson abhors framing the ultimate villain as if he like the Zodiac killer were the movies secret star.)The dour spirit of merriment in this clammy universe Maras elfin Salander is not exactly a carbon copy of the spiky-haired menace that Noomi Rapace played in the Oplev movie. Shes funnier as well as more plaintive in her deadpan aplomb. (And once her cockscomb mohawk gives way to a less off-putting coif she seems more playful her outfit taking on the feel of a store-bought Halloween costume.) Nor is Finchers Tattoo a shot-by-shot or even a scene-by-scene recap of Oplevs dowdier production. The remake is an altogether leaner meaner more high-powered stylish and deftly directed affair though similarly hampered by a too-long narrative fuse.Running 158 minutes The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo requires over an hour for Blomkvists story to converge with Salanders and though things do pick up once reporter and hacker begin pursuing parallel research tracks (as well as each other) it grossly overstays its welcome. Where the shudder-inducing Zodiac and even The Social Network resisted closure Dragon Tattoo persists in pursuing three separate endings and by the time they wrap the movie is less a walk on the wild side than an evening stroll through a well-lit topiary garden.

"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo 2001 David Finchers voyeuristic shallow adaptation fails to transcend its source material. Slate Sign In Sign Up David Finchers Adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is Voyeuristic and Shallow David Finchers Adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is Voyeuristic and Shallow Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 20 2011 526 PM The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo David Finchers voyeuristic shallow adaptation fails to transcend its source material. By Dana Stevens Rooney Mara in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Still (c) 2011 Columbia TriStar Marketing Group. All rights reserved. Stieg Larssons global best-seller The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was to this reader an insurmountable ziggurat of featureless prose a run-of-the-mill serial-killer whodunit spiked with generous doses of nasty sexual violence. But if the books massive success remains perplexing its appeal to director David Fincher--who has remade the workmanlike 2009 Swedish adaptation as a slick and somber Hollywood entertainment--is perfectly understandable. Finchers earlier serial-killer films Se7en and Zodiac evince a scholarly fascination with the infinite varieties of human depravity along with an unapologetically sick imagination (remember Brad Pitts FedEx delivery at the end of Se7en?). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But even Finchers elegantly gruesome style cant turn this Swedish noir into the meditation on evil and corruption that it fancies itself to be. The villains--aged Nazi partisans unscrupulous industrialists and slaveringly lecherous state-appointed guardians--are just too villainous and the heroes--a muckraking journalist and an emotionally disturbed computer genius--too heroic. Fincher is a master of mood and atmosphere but this chilly efficient movie never transcends the shallowness of its source material. Fans of the Larsson franchise often explain the books success by pointing to the intriguingly bizarre heroine Lisbeth Salander (here played by Rooney Mara last seen wearing a Fair Isle sweater as Mark Zuckerbergs disenchanted ex in Finchers The Social Network.) A bisexual hacker with multiple piercings a dyed-black Mohawk and a sullen almost autistic lack of visible affect Lisbeth is a feminist revenge fantasy personified a perfect victim turned perfect executioner. A ward of the state for reasons that remain vague until late in the film shes forced by the man who controls her financial disbursements (Yorick van Wageningen) to perform humiliating sex acts in exchange for the money. When she takes her revenge on him its swift sudden and seriously hard-core. This early scene sets the tone for whats to come Fincher wants us to be horrified by people who treat other people like pieces of meat but hes not above taking us on a guided tour of the abattoir. Advertisement The films other main thread which takes a while to join up with Lisbeths concerns Mikael Blomkvist (an even-more-muted-than-usual Daniel Craig) a reporter whos gone on leave after being publicly disgraced in a libel suit. (Thankfully this dull legal subplot has been whittled way down--the aftermath of the lawsuit played a large role in the book and always felt suspiciously like autobiographical score-settling on the part of the author a former reporter himself.) Because of his mad research skills (in Larssons world crusading journalists enjoy a James Bond level of notoriety) Blomkvist is called in by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) the wealthy patriarch of a Northern Swedish family to investigate a 40-year-old cold case. After a family gathering in 1966 Vangers teenage great-niece Harriet abruptly vanished never to be seen again. Vanger offers Blomkvist the use of a rustic cottage on his property and pays him handsomely to sort through old files trying to find something the police may have missed. The Vangers are an unpleasant lot--dour unforthcoming and at least in the older generation disturbingly prone to neo-Nazi affiliations. Blomkvist spends a long winter in mostly fruitless conversation with Harriets brother Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) and her cousin Anita (Joely Richardson) whos moved to London with a secret of her own. But the investigation starts to pick up when Lisbeth who was initially contracted by the Vangers to investigate Blomkvists background joins him in his frigid cabin for some inspired Internet research and grimly unfun-looking sex. The films strongest section centers on a series of photographs taken a few hours before Harriets disappearance. Theres some nifty Blow-Up-style business here as Blomkvist strings together these images reconstructing the events of her last known day on earth. But these scenes hint at a satisfyingly moody procedural that this movie never quite becomes. When the truth about Harriets disappearance does emerge its lurid without being particularly surprising and the last quarter of the movie goes by in a blur of sensationally icky flashbacks and ickier comeuppances. Noomi Rapace who played Lisbeth in the 2009 Swedish version was wiry but sturdily athletic; Maras Lisbeth is wraithlike and skeletal with invisible bleached-out eyebrows and livid-white skin. Its hard to tell whether Mara is really good in the role or just looks good. Her Lisbeth is a triumph of freaky-Goth styling and attitude but when for example she unsmilingly mounts the diffident Blomkvist we have no idea why she suddenly wants to jump his bones (or why he lets her; given the wretched treatment this woman has received at the hands of men her whole life wouldnt the kindest reaction be one of polite deferral?). To Finchers credit The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo does look and sound stunning with its stark Scandinavian snowscapes crisscrossed by sleek black motorcycles (Lisbeths preferred mode of transportation) and a tense discordant score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails. The opening credit sequence with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs Karen O growling a Led Zeppelin song over the repeated image of thick black oil pouring over naked bodies could stand alone as a killer music video. Finchers decision to have his actors speak with faint Scandinavian accents adds to the subtle sense of displacement--this is a universe where no one is at home where something is slightly unsettlingly off. The title of the late Stieg Larssons novel translates to ""men who hate women"" and its clearly this element that attracted Fincher to the material. But for all of its gloomy chic and carefully considered aesthetic choices this clinical film seems curiously uninterested in women or indeed in people. The moral outrage at the center of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo--the systematic rape and slaughter of pretty young girls? Were agin it--feels facile and inessential. Fincher eagerly rubs our faces in the movies scenes of misogynist violence and degradation but a few hours after leaving the theater the oily film these images leave behind has all but washed away.

Over the last few years Ive watched mystery buffs and non-readers alike lugging around the adventures of Lisbeth Salander before eagerly watching the Swedish film adaptations at the movies or on DVD but the whole phenomenon has been a dog whistle that I never heard until seeing David Finchers much-anticipated ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" The result is a movie that is engaging almost from start to finish although its hampered by some significant flaws -- some I can only guess probably go all the way back to the source material. But much of the familiarity in the storytelling comes from Fincher himself who seems to be rehashing concepts from his earlier successes ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac."" Odds are you know the story Journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) loses a libel lawsuit against a wealthy financier and faces personal and professional ruin. Unbeknownst to him hes being thoroughly researched by computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) on behalf of corporate magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Vanger hires Blomkvist ostensibly to write his memoirs but what Vanger really wants is for Blomkvist to figure out what happened to Vangers niece Harriet who disappeared decades earlier. Vangers family is a creepy bunch indeed riddled with internecine feuds and at least one former Nazi. And as Blomkvist investigates Harriets disappearance -- eventually with Lisbeths help -- he uncovers the trail of what appears to be a particularly vicious serial killer with a clear-cut M.O. And thats where we start getting into ""Seven""/""Zodiac"" territory. Not that Fincher doesnt do this sort of thing extraordinarily well but he has until now seemed like a director who can explore favorite themes without repeating himself. With ""Dragon Tattoo"" it feels like hes been sent on a lucrative arena tour that demands that he play his greatest hits over and over again. Steven Zaillians screenplay like that of the recently-released adaptation of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" has the onerous task of introducing us to a gaggle of characters -- there are at least a half-dozen Vangers for us to try and keep track of -- and manages to keep everything and everyone clear in the viewers mind. (Even Larsson had to throw in a family-tree chart.) Where Zaillian stumbles (and again Im assuming this goes all the way back to Larsson) is in the two lead characters -- Lisbeth Salander has become something of a pop-culture icon but I didnt believe in her for a second despite Maras valiant attempts. Shes a brilliant hacker with a photographic memory and is somehow able to accomplish anything she wants except when it comes to her rapist social worker who attempts to exploit her before she gains the upper hand. Blomkvist on the other hand seems like the most mealy-mouthed and inert investigative journalist who ever lived. I would say that the utterly passive Blomkvist is the Lois Lane to Lisbeths Superman but thats not fair to Lois Lane; perhaps hes the Olive Oyl to her Popeye. The other script flaw that also feels like the books fault is the ending -- or rather several endings followed by a non-climax that reminds us that weve got two more sequels going. On the technical side everything about ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is first-rate. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth gives the film a chilly visual crispness thats appropriate for the Scandinavian setting and Fincher reteams ""Social Network"" composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who this time weave a perfect little symphony of dread throughout. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" provides all the jolts and forward motion that any good airport novel gives you but this is the film equivalent of the book that kept you awake from Chicago to Baltimore only you dont feel bad about leaving it on the seat next to you after you land.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.What it comes down to is ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is Rooney Maras movie in the role of Lisbeth Salander.Story highlightsDavid Finchers ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a top-notch thrillerRooney Mara is nothing short of brilliant and deserving of acclaimDaniel Craig does some of his best work to date as BlomkvistOften US remakes of foreign language films are so poorly made as to completely lose whatever made them attractive for remaking in the first place. Films like 2002s ""Insomnia"" (a remake of Erik Skoldbjaergs excellent original and a rare misstep for Christopher Nolan) and 1993s ""Point of No Return"" (a rather pale remake of 1990s brilliant Luc Besson film ""Nikita"") were far inferior to their non-American predecessors. David Finchers ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" however is a top-notch thriller that looks likely to give Niels Arden Oplevs original a run for its money even among its fans. For the 15 of you who have not read the book (count me in that minority) ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a mystery thriller that begins with the end of a high-profile trial in which nationally renowned journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has just been convicted of libel. He maintains that his reporting was correct but the court rules that he couldnt prove his allegations against one of Swedens wealthiest men and renders a rather stiff financial judgment against him.While he avoids jail time the verdict costs him his life savings and severely damages the reputation and financial well-being of Millennium the magazine he co-publishes with Erika Berger (Robin Wright) his married on-again/off-again lover. Shortly after the trial ends Blomkvist is contacted by Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) the attorney for Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) a retired industrial magnate who wants to hire Blomkvist to investigate an unsolved murder. It seems Henriks favorite niece Harriet disappeared 40 years ago and he is convinced she was murdered by a member of his family which he describes as a collection of ""thieves misers bullies ... the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet."" They include at least two Nazis.JUST WATCHEDIs Dragon Tattoo Oscar bait?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIs Dragon Tattoo Oscar bait? 0349Thus begins this engrossing twisted and occasionally unsettling thriller the first half of which is basically a dual-story affair. One thread is the start of Blomkvists investigation into Harriets murder (hidden from the rest of the Vanger clan behind the pretense that he is writing a Vanger family history); the other introduces us to the fascinating character that is Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) the master computer hacker/private investigator who Vanger hired to do a background check on Blomkvist.Mara is nothing short of brilliant deserves every bit of acclaim thrown her way and is rightly in the conversation for a best actress nomination. Shes completely immersed in her character (the Internet is rife with stories of all the piercing training and bleaching that she did to get into character) and flat out becomes Lisbeth. While Blomkvist is a thorough and meticulous investigative journalist its clear that hes in over his head. Enter Lisbeth one of the great literary and filmic characters of our time. Shes permanently about 5 degrees shy of a roiling boil and yet is often completely placid ... on the outside at least. Shes the most tightly wound delicate yet tough as nails wholly offbeat supremely cool character to come along in years and I think I am in love. While his character is not even remotely as interesting as Salander Craig does some of his best work to date as Blomkvist and its fun watching him slowly start to learn just how deep and dark the investigation is becoming. Spending weeks away from the spotlight of Stockholm is exactly what he needs to get his juices flowing again and get over his personal and professional setback.The pacing is mostly perfect (ok maybe little bits of ""TV procedural"" style sneak in here and there especially in the films final act) and Fincher and his team are master manipulators in the best sense of the word. Whatever the mood requirement of a particular scene be that suspense fear horror pity disgust or arousal they get it done. (Although one particular scene mentioned below may cross the line for some.) The country of Sweden ought to get lead billing. As Fincher has said this film could not have been transferred to a North American city and the smartest decision the producers made was to not only shoot it in Sweden but to make a very Swedish film. Considering how important the location is to the story to move it anywhere else or to tone down the Scandinavian nature of the film would have been crippling. While I was underwhelmed with ""The Social Network"" (Yeah yeah I know -- save it) theres no question that David Fincher is one of the most talented filmmakers working today. From the first teaser it was clear that ""Dragon Tattoo"" was going to be something special and Fincher doesnt disappoint. Its a long film at slightly more than 21/2 hours and not once did I get antsy.""Dragon Tattoo"" is a measured simmering and suspenseful detective thriller injected with bursts of action and violence including a truly sickening scene that treads just this side of NC-17 and which made me more uncomfortable as a viewer than I would like. Those familiar with the book or original film will guess of what I speak and the scene in question in this version is even more unsettling than in the original.Ms. Maras performance is both emotionally and occasionally physically naked and while Fincher is indeed a fantastic director I would be intrigued to see what a woman director would do with this sort of material. The above-mentioned scenes in particular played a bit too exploitative and prurient for my tastes. That said it was a very small part of an otherwise engrossing and entertaining film. Fincher along with screenwriter Stephen Zaillian composers Trent Reznor amp; Atticus Ross cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and the rest of the crew have created a tight dark and mysterious world one rife with family secrets sexual perversity financial corruption and on occasion redemption. When it comes down to it this is Rooney Maras movie and I dont care if the second and third stories are any good as long as they are full of Lisbeth Salander.""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) and contains sex and violence as well as the combination of the two.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo The (2011) | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-the-2011 ) Girl with the Dragon Tattoo The (2011) (United States/Sweden 2011) December 20 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The dark seeps out of the screen like living thing evidence that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is more than a paycheck to director David Fincher who has improbably affixed his own imprint on a movie that comes weighted down with possibilities and expectations no filmmaker should have to contend with. Aided by a tightly-wrapped screenplay adapted from Stieg Larssons global best-seller by Steven Zaillian Fincher strips the material to its skeleton then adds back the sinew and tissue to create something that is unmistakably The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but in no way a carbon copy of the earlier Swedish movie or the book itself. This is what a movie adaptation should be a film whose base narrative has its roots in the source material but whose soul can be identified through the images that unfold on screen. When in early 2010 Columbia Pictures announced their intention to film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo the question that crossed many lips was ""Why?"" After all there was already a very good adaptation available a 2009 Swedish production directed by Niels Arden Oplev with a star-making turn from Noomi Rapace. The intention to ""remake"" The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English with an A-list star smacked of a cash-grab. Whatever the motivations however this interpretation of Larssons story can stand proudly alongside the Swedish version. Both tell the same basic story but there are enough differences - some subtle some significant - that each can be enjoyed on its own terms. And although Oplev will always have the distinction of being first the strengths of Finchers film reminds us that first is not always best. Two key elements differentiate Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from Oplevs (and please dont misread this in any way as a denunciation of the Swedish interpretation which was one of my top films of 2010). The first is the aesthetic. Filmed with a bigger budget and an auteur behind the camera the 2011 movie is steeped in bleak cold darkness. Everything from the wintery setting to the gloomy interiors to the way scenes are photographed enhances this aspect. Oplevs approach was more straightforward and not as assured. The second is the way the characters are represented. Fincher softens the edges and presents us with more emotionally complex individuals. Oplev emphasizes individual characteristics. Some of the characters in the 2009 movie are little more than caricatures (the vile and sadistic Bjurman being an example) but Fincher quests for ambiguity. If The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo represents Finchers view of human nature (and considering the darkness of his early films that may be the case) it puts him alongside David Lynch as one who believes society breeds hidden rot and corruption. Those elements lie at the heart of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and despite occasional moments of macabre humor Fincher allows them to fester. I am reminded of a line from I Claudius ""Let all the poisons that lurk in the mud hatch out."" Zaillians screenplay does a better job than the one penned by Nikolaj Arcel amp; Rasmus Heisterberg in distilling Larsssons convoluted story into something movie audiences can absorb without a primer. In fairness to the writers of the Swedish version their 180-minute original lost 28 minutes in the transition from TV mini-series to motion picture and thats part of the reason for its occasionally erratic tone and discontinuities. Still Zaillian has surgically altered Larssons book for the screen by cutting adding and changing where necessary. The final result is a coherent well-developed murder mystery that is neither rushed nor sluggish. It also keeps us waiting for a while for the two main characters to meet - that doesnt happen until the one-hour mark. Until that point their stories are kept separate to better clarify their places in the overall narrative and to provide a stronger sense of who they are as individuals (rather than as a pair). Once they meet they get to share the screen often enough to generate a peculiar frisson. Larsson openly admitted to using the British detective story as the basis for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it shows in the movies structure. Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Daniel Craig) is brought to an island community in the north of Sweden to meet with retired millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Henrik would like Mikael to look into a 40-year old murder - a ""cold case"" that has haunted him for half his life. In 1966 Henriks 16-year old grand-niece Harriet disappeared and was assumed murdered. Her body was never found but there was no evidence to indicate she had fled on her own. Her killer has gone undiscovered and unpunished but Henrik believes the circle of suspects to be small his family (an assorted batch of oddballs malcontents and Nazis). After taking the job Mikael recruits the asocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to be his assistant. Lisbeth a whiz with gadgets and research proves invaluable as Mikaels uncovering and interpretation of clues leads him deeper into the web of a venomous spider. The central character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is Mikael. He is accorded the most screen time and is established as a conventional protagonist. He is played by the best-known member of the cast the reigning James Bond Daniel Craig. But he is by no means the most interesting individual to grace the screen during the 158 minutes when the movie unfolds. That distinction belongs to Lisbeth Salander the glum emotionally stunted technically brilliant goth whose tormented past is hidden beneath a costume of piercings and body art. Lisbeth is one of those characters who draws the audiences attention. As played by Rooney Mara shes a girl-child trapped in a womans body whose moments of rage are terrible to behold. She is both impenetrably cold and desperately fragile. Considered against the way Mara portrays Lisbeth Noomi Rapaces memorable performance was almost conventional. Comparing the two is pointless - both are very good and very different - but Maras Lisbeth is more sympathetic and at times more merciless. Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo also manages to make Mikael into more than a nondescript detective and straight man for Lisbeths weird brilliance. (In this milieu shes Holmes to his Watson.) Craig aided by the screenplay fleshes out Mikael. He is never as captivating as Lisbeth but neither does he vanish into her shadow. The quasi-romantic relationship that develops between the two is more intriguing than the more traditional one in the Swedish movie. Here their emotional investment is unequal with Mikael viewing it as casual while Lisbeth for perhaps the first time in her life has discovered feelings between the sheets (or more appropriately on top of them). The supporting cast includes well-known names like Christopher Plummer (as Henrik) Robin Wright (as Mikaels co-editor at Millennium magazine Erika Berger) and Stellan Skarsgard (as Henriks nephew Martin) and less familiar ones like Steven Berkoff (as Henriks lawyer Frode) and Yorick van Wageningen (as the detestable Bjurman). Aside from Craig there are no bona fide ""stars"" in the mix but the cast is well-chosen. Everyone does an excellent job and Mara will undoubtedly receive as Oscar nomination for this brave star-making turn. Its somewhat astonishing that Fincher managed to secure an R-rating for a movie whose depictions of sexual sadism (including an anal rape) and consensual intercourse are so graphic. True to his word the director does not pull punches and these scenes are as graphic (if not moreso) in the American production as in the Swedish one. One of the early trailers for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo advertised this as being the ""feel-bad movie of the season"" and theres some truth to that. This is not the happiest experience one can have in a theater but its cumulative power to provoke and entice is undeniable. And as grim a view as it may have of humanity it offers a compulsively watchable mystery/thriller whose standard elements - clues red herrings a limited number of suspects - adds to its entertainment quotient. This is a rare dark movie that can be enjoyed on a visceral level. Theres plenty of suspense and tension in its DNA. Those familiar with Larssons work are aware that he finished two additional books about Mikael and Lisbeth before his death The Girl who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest. These have both been filmed in Sweden. Fincher would like to get a crack at them as well although the worldwide box office performance of this movie will go a long way toward deciding whether that happens. Personally I would love to see what this creative team could do with those books (which are inferior to the first one). Regardless of what happens in the future however The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo can stand on its own as Finchers valentine to goth girl power detective stories and the grotesqueness of the human heart.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post  1/2 stars (out of four) | Crime Thriller David Finchers handsome adaptation of the blockbuster crime thriller ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" opens with a lush credit sequence. All quicksilver blacks and liquid coals it provides an evocative introduction to novelist Steig Larssons unlikely duo journalist Mikael Blomkvist and cyber-savant Lisbeth Salander. The sequence has the seductive beauty of a James Bond movie prologue. Which one might take as a winking tribute. After all 007 portrayer Daniel Craig plays Mikael. But the film is far too moody to be merely winking. And one would be hard-pressed to mistake Lisbeth for a Bond girl -- or anyone elses girl for that matter. Newcomer Rooney Mara portrays the security specialist whose traumatic personal history has created an emotionally armored soul. Christopher Plummer brings bittersweet wisdom to the character of Henrik Vanger the catalyst who brings Lisbeth and Mikael together. The one-time captain of industry hires Mikael to resolve a family mystery that itself twists and turns into darker tales of atrocity. Lisbeth is the security ace who provided the background check on Mikael for Henriks lawyer. Decades earlier Henriks beloved niece Harriet disappeared. Each year he receives a pressed flower -- similar to those Harriet gave him for his birthday. Vanger believes her killer is trying to torment him further. The Vangers are not a trusting clan. There were Nazi sympathizers. There were wife beaters. There remain a bigoted tippler or two. Though they share the same island a few hours from Stockholm they dont much like one another. The job offer arrives at an opportune time for Mikael. The financial reporter and magazine publisher has just been legally chastened for libel and needs to create some space between himself and the magazine he co-founded with his long-time lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright). In establishing Mikael and Lisbeth as the franchises couple the movie earns its 2 1/2 -hour length as it moves the duos parallel stories toward a thorny first intersection. Whatever vulnerability Craig shows as Mikael cant be mistaken for male-feminist evasion. (The Swedish portrayal of Mikael was a softer sell.) Indeed the first face-to-face between him and Lisbeth is a surprisingly if understandably bullying bit of business. The ensemble is strong. Stellan Skarsgard brings a monied confidence to Martin Vanger Harriets brother and the head of the family business. Wright restores backbone and intellect to the character of Erika. While no movie dealing with sexual abuse serial murder and institutional rot should make for easy reckoning the Swedish film underscored a problem in adapting Larssons first novel How can a movie show sexual degradation without appearing to use sexual violence as a come-on? With the help of Mara director Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian do a better (if still imperfect) job of answering that quandary by not overplaying Lisbeths lifestyle. As idiosyncratic a creature as she may be Lisbeth is never treated as a freak. This is no small matter when she comes face-to-face with a monster. Maras Lisbeth can be brashly young and impossibly smart. Its a performance that should well serve the upcoming sequels ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.""

Watch Clips From The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - Shes Different Shes Different Credit Sony Pictures From The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - Shes Had A Rough Life Shes Had A Rough Life Credit Sony Pictures From The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - You And I Need To Talk You And I Need To Talk Credit Sony Pictures The Hollywood remake is of course in English and scripter Steven Zaillian has altered some of the details or simply taken different ones from the novel. And Fincher having struggled with dramatizing computer use in The Social Network shows less of dragon-inked hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) at the keyboard and on the Net. Otherwise though Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is less a reinterpretation than a reiteration. Watching this stylish but ever so slightly boring movie viewers may wish the filmmakers had done something to outrage the books bazillion fans. Move it to Scotland perhaps or lose the romance between the bisexual Lisbeth and her crime-fighting partner the polyamorously hetero Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). As everyone with an interest in this movie already knows Mikael is a crusading Stockholm journalist who just lost a libel suit brought by a malignant businessman. He decides to exit Millennium the muckraking journal he runs with his (married) lover Erika (Robin Wright). Then Mikael is offered a healthy stipend to investigate a stone-cold missing-persons case. Elderly industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) has wondered about his favorite niece Harriet since she vanished in 1966. Hes convinced that the girl then 16 was murdered probably by a member of the generally loathsome Vanger clan. These include Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) the brother of the missing Harriet and Anita (Joely Richardson) one of the few Vangers who doesnt live on a private island in frosty northern Sweden. Mikael was vetted for the gig by unconventional sleuth Lisbeth a pierced and tattooed goth girl who investigates people by hacking their computers. (Not their phones -- the story occurs before the smartphone era.) Lisbeth and Mikael connect in a different way than in the Swedish movie but their collaboration is otherwise familiar. Lisbeth a part-time feminist avenger is intrigued by what turns out to be Mikaels quest identifying a serial killer whose female victims were murdered to Old Testament specifications. i Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer left) offers Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) a big paycheck to crack the mystery of his missing granddaughter. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer left) offers Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) a big paycheck to crack the mystery of his missing granddaughter. Sony Pictures This part of the sprawling plot is basically Angels and Demons with Nazis and Fincher doesnt seem especially committed to it. He includes the gruesome homicides their Biblical connections and Larssons link between todays rightists and yesterdays fascists and anti-Semites. But the film doesnt spend any more time on this silliness than needed to uphold the original plot. Much more immediate is Lisbeths battle against corrupt male authority personified by her legal guardian. For reasons that most viewers will already know the 23-year-old hacker is still a ward of the state. When her chubby new custodian (Yorick van Wageningen) sexually abuses her Lisbeth takes violent and elaborate revenge. By comparison her eventual showdown with a villainous Vanger is anticlimactic. The Americanized Girl with the Dragon Tattoo looks and sounds great. Its shot in wintry tones and driven by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross pulses drones and thumps which add tension to stretches of dry exposition. But the movies classiness actually works against it. The Swedish version was sloppier and trashier which suited the material. If that movie was more lurid it also packed more genuine emotion. Mara and Craig embody their characters with assurance and precision but they -- like the movie theyre in -- are a bit too cold a little too clean. For a sleazefest like this to work everyone needs to get into the muck.

CAST Rooney Mara Daniel Craig Stellan Skarsgard. DIRECTOR David Fincher LENGTH 238 Blindfolds gags tongues fists -- and thats just the opening credits of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" David Finchers adaptation of the massively popular Swedish crime novel and 2009 film. Its stylish if not exactly subtle and daringly brutal for a Hollywood movie. Its also so uneven and overlong that it may leave non-fans wondering what all the fuss has been about. ""Dragon Tattoo"" is based on the first of Stieg Larssons trilogy an odd but compelling fusion of detective fiction and goth-punk culture. It focuses partly on former journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig suave but vulnerable) who is hired by wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the decades-old disappearance of his granddaughter. Shes presumed murdered -- probably by someone in their creepy Nazi-riddled family (played by Stellan Skarsgard Joely Richardson and others). But the central character is Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) a bisexual club kid and freelance hacker. Covered in piercings and ink (hence the films title) she makes quite an impression; touch her and shes likely to leave a deeper one. Husky Swedish actress Noomi Rapace originally played Lisbeth as a blunt instrument; Mara a waifish but laser-eyed newcomer convincingly turns her into a scalpel. Gingerly Mikael recruits her to help solve a mystery that soon points to an entire series of atrocities.

But he cant find a consistent tone for this patchwork narrative -- the movie is part noir part rock video -- and the final half-hour which focuses on an unrelated (and uninteresting) villain nearly torpedoes the whole project.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 20 2011 Save for later Saved Rooney Mara is shown in a scene from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Merrick Morton/Columbia Pictures/Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 2009 Swedish movie ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" which ran for 180 minutes in its extended version was probably more than enough for most aficionados of the Stieg Larsson bestseller. Not so says Hollywood which recruited David Fincher to restart the clock. If his film is successful we can likely expect at least two sequels. I didnt think the original Swedish film was an instant classic and the Larsson material isnt exactly holy writ either. There is no inherent reason why this remake shouldnt work at least as well as the Swedish original. And yet when it was all over I was hit with the same question I had going in Why?Fincher at least on paper was the right director for the job. He specializes in sordid sexualized scenarios in which people are isolated by anomie and brutality (""Seven"" ""Zodiac"" ""Fight Club""). As all the world knows ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is about a crusading disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who teams up with pierced and punkish computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to investigate the long-ago disappearance possibly murder of the beloved 16-year-old niece of their wealthy industrialist employer Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) the patriarch of a highly dysfunctional clan. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The kick in this material especially in this new version which plays down Mikaels surliness is Lisbeth a pixieish polysexual outlier who seems equipped with her own portable storm cloud. Mara stands up favorably to the originals Noomi Rapace. She emerges from her welter of piercings with a dynamo demeanor all her own. The problem with the film is not Lisbeth its Finchers surprisingly straightforward almost unengaged approach. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? He moves the action forward swiftly and cleanly - which could not always be said of the original - and with his screenwriter Steven Zaillian he even provides a wrap-up that is more emotionally satisfying than the books. As the missing girls brother Martin Stellan Skarsgard is as implacably smooth as one might wish for.But Finchers achievement in the end is essentially impersonal. For those of us who recoiled at his signature films especially ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"" this might not seem like such a bad thing. Still I wonder why (aside from the obvious commercial aspect) he bothered to take the remake on instead of fashioning his own universe. The coolness here has its creepiness as in the dispassionate way Fincher depicts Lisbeths rape and her subsequent harrowing revenge but the suspicion remains Fincher didnt make this movie his own because he doesnt consider it his own.

In a Stockholm subway station a man grabs her computer bag and dashes up an escalator toward the street. Lisbeth runs after the thief kicks him where it hurts and retrieves the bag then eludes the man and his confederates by sliding down the escalator partition to the subway platform and slipping between the closing doors of a departing train. The whole thing takes about a minute. This scene from David Finchers version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first in the trilogy of Swedish thrillers by Stieg Larsson displays a masterly construction of lightning suspense and action choreography. Who are the bagnappers? What force of evil has employed them? Those questions can tantalize the viewer but at this point they dont matter. The crucial thing is the daubing of another vivid shade on Lisbeths personality. She is a haunted hunted creature who possesses quick and ruthless means of defending herself -- the goth girl as action heroine. On its own the scene stands as an expert demonstration of the visceral kick that is unique to the best American pop movies. (MORE 10 Questions for David Fincher) The Larsson books were violent thrillers elevated by social messages -- the equivalent of pulp fiction printed on fine vellum. That definition could nearly fit Finchers first six features. Alien 3 Se7en The Game Fight Club Panic Room and Zodiac all revealed his facility and preoccupation with scenarios of cat-to-mouse sadism. And depending on your opinion of Mark Zuckerberg you could see Finchers The Social Network as a less lurid take on the same story. (Ill skip The Curious Case of Benjamin Button another Fincher film I love but which doesnt fit this thesis.) So its easy to see why one of our most accomplished distinguished directors would be drawn to Dragon Tattoo. (MORE The Legacy of the Dragon Tattoo) Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian just had to pretend that the novel hadnt already been made into a pretty fine Swedish film. Hollywood has often Americanized foreign movies James Camerons True Lies Terry Gilliams Twelve Monkeys Paul Haggis The Next Three Days and the Steve Carell comedy Dinner for Schmucks were all remakes of French films. But the 2009 Dragon Tattoo directed by Niels Arden Oplev and cut down from a Swedish miniseries earned more than 100 million at the worldwide box office and was the biggest foreign-language art-house hit in North America since the Edith Piaf biopic La Vie en Rose. The movie and its two sequels also showcased a scary-great performance by Noomi Rapace who crept inside Lisbeth to impart the girls battered heroic glory. (MORE TIMEs Review of the Swedish Dragon Tattoo Film) For a significant minority of the audience then the new film will be stalked by the shadow of Oplevs original and the indelible memory of Rapaces Lisbeth. To them the Fincher version may be as crass as Pat Boones covers of Fats Domino and Little Richard songs in the 1950s the dilution of an authentic piece by a mainstream appropriator. Finchers admirers may discount the charge of coopting and yet still wonder what spurred him to spend a year of his life -- more if he directs films of the second and third books -- on a fairly faithful adaptation of an international best seller that became an international hit movie. I had that same thought before and after seeing this Dragon Tattoo Why bother? (MORE The Social Network A Pie in the Face for Zuckerberg) Before the movie begins Lisbeth used her hacking skills to ferret into the personal life of Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) a left-wing muckraker facing jail time for slandering a powerful industrialist. Now she joins Mikael on a dirtier job of inside investigative reporting. Another Swedish plutocrat Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) has hired Mikael and Lisbeth to solve the mysterious disappearance and presumed murder of Henriks great-niece Harriet in 1966. Mikael holes up on the Vangers frosty private island thumbing through old photographs while Lisbeth buries herself in library stacks researching the familys odd history. Other than Henriks amiable nephew Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) the Vangers seem as cranky and crazy as Leatherfaces clan in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. If you thought the statute of limitations on Nazi torturers might have expired 66 years after the fall of the Third Reich think again. Some villains have too great a hold on the popular imagination to fade from popular fiction. Nazis and their spawn arent the only sexual sadists in this story. The Swedish title of Larssons novel translates as ""Men Who Hate Women""; for half her young life as the daughter of a mobster and a ward of the state Lisbeth has had intimate knowledge of their priapic predations. One such man is Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen) appointed Lisbeths guardian when her previous supervisor suffers a stroke. Bjurman has suave conversational skills a bureaucratic authoritativeness and the compulsion to manacle and torture the young women in his care. Hes good at all these things we can infer because hes done them so often. When Lisbeth resists he says ""I like reticence. Its almost convincing."" As an afterthought before penetrating her he says ""I forgot to ask Do you like anal sex?"" In van Wageningens meaty almost musical rendition Bjurman is quite the smooth sickie -- just like the killer Mikael and Lisbeth will eventually confront. (LIST Top 10 Best Movies of 2011) The main bad guy says murder is ""the science of a thousand details."" So is directing a complex movie like this and Fincher throws his considerable energy and skill into every frame. Start with the opening-credit sequence a pristine rendering of down-and-dirty impulses with bats and dragon images flickering through enough oil to pollute the Gulf of Mexico that is nonetheless silky and sexy. The sequence is a reminder of Finchers early work directing music videos for Madonna Aerosmith and Nine Inch Nails. (Trent Reznor former front man for Nine Inch Nails and Atticus Ross composed Dragon Tattoos creepily evocative score.) As Mikael and Lisbeth sleuth through similarly dank pools of human depravity Fincher stirs echoes of the detectives pursuit of a killer genius in Se7en and the minutely detailed procedural aspects of Zodiac. Tracking down a killer requires sneaking around and snapping furtive photos (which Lisbeth takes with an old-fashioned camera not an iPhone) but also endless hours of reading and typing. Fincher manages to impart some cinematic verve to the sedentary application of nerd power; the movie raises it to seraphic levels. Or it can be twisted into the satanic -- since a man who enjoys torturing and slaughtering women but wouldnt care to get caught at it also needs to be a resourceful researcher. ""You and I are quite similar"" the killer tells Mikael. ""We both have urges. But mine require more towels."" In a basement-laboratory climax that is close enough to The Human Centipede to make some viewers squirm and others giggle Dragon Tattoo almost summons awe for the killers psycho-majesty. (MORE The Girl Who Played with Fire Moony over Noomi) Whatever the magnetism of a thriller plot involving the deranged rich (and in this version theres little question about whodunit since that ""who"" is the only suspect the film spends much time with) the irresistible lure of Larssons book is Lisbeth -- for readers and viewers no less than for Fincher. Her black garb pierced flesh and tattooed back are both an advertisement of otherness and a kind of corporeal performance art. This her body suggests is how men who hate women have inscribed their lust. When provoked she will do the same to them. In executing her own sentences on monsters like Bjurman Lisbeth passes severe justice on the male impulse that brutalizes women. She is both the avatar of all these victims and their avenger. For anyone making a film of Dragon Tattoo the single most important decision is the casting of Lisbeth. The Swedes hit the jackpot with Rapace; her incarnation of a burning intelligence and a wounded psyche sent the movie soaring far above its thriller moorings. Did Fincher consider her for his own Dragon Tattoo? There would have been a precedent. When the 1936 Swedish film Intermezzo another story about the relationship of a middle-aged man and a beguiling young woman was remade in Hollywood three years later producer David O. Selznick decided that the female lead would be played by the same young Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman. Fincher didnt go that way; he awarded the Lisbeth part to Mara who made a strong impression as Zuckerbergs disastrous date in the first scene of The Social Network. The director has said he warned Mara that this could be a career-defining role -- that no matter what else she goes on to do she may always be associated with it like Vivien Leigh with Scarlett OHara. (LIST See Noomi Rapace in TIMEs List of Great Performances) She is closer to Lisbeths age than Rapace and through training and makeup she looks the part. In one scene when her pale face peeks through a black cowl she could be a figure from Ingmar Bergmans medieval morality play The Seventh Seal deaths kid sister. She throws herself into the role her craft chasing her ambition. When Lisbeth tells her guardian ""The reports suggest that Im insane -- I am insane"" you may almost believe her. Almost but not quite. She acquits herself perfectly O.K. but Mara is no OHara; Rooney is no Noomi. She doesnt achieve what Rapace did a miraculous alchemy of actress into character. In that sense Mara is the face and heart of the film a well-wrought simulacrum of the original. Seeing Finchers version is like getting a Christmas gift of a book you already have. This edition has a nicer binding and prettier illustrations than your beloved old paperback but its essentially a reproduction of the same old dragon. Dragon Tat-two.

"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (R) Director David Finchers adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel is a dark thriller with a love story at its center. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/20/2011 Editor rating 3.5 For much of the first hour of David Finchers The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you marvel at the movies sumptuous style cringe at its grave horrors and wonder why exactly Fincher bothered to make it. The laborious mystery at the center of Stieg Larssons blockbuster novel has already spawned a hit film directed by Niels Arden Oplev in 2009. Finchers version -- which isnt so much a remake as it is a different take on the book -- has a grander scale more elegant images and a distinct demonic energy. But the new movie initially feels redundant like an old joke with a tired punch line. We know how this story ends and it isnt worth all this effort. And then comes the first scene in which Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara appear on the screen together and just like that all is forgiven. Chemistry is one of the few things left filmmakers cant fake with CGI and the dynamic between Craig and Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so sensational it instantly propels the movie beyond glossy high-toned pulp into something far more affecting. Mara previously best known for playing the girl who dumped Mark Zuckerberg in the first scene of The Social Network doesnt court sympathy with her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander the goth-freak who has become a fashionable poster child for feminism. With her multiple piercings a cadaverous pallor and a hermetic demeanor Lisbeth is the sort of weirdo you would cross the street to avoid. But Mara never leans on the cliches of the brooding outsider or even Lisbeths bizarre taste in haircuts to bring her to life. Instead the actress uses subtle glances and body language and stillness to convey her characters emotional turmoil. The performance is so thorough Lisbeths otherness gradually melts away until you see the vulnerable almost childlike person within. Mara lets you inside the heart of darkness Lisbeth inhabits and youre swept along as this troubled beauty hesitantly succumbs to an unexpected romance. As Mikael Blomvkist the reporter hired to investigate an unsolved crime Craig is the prickly center of the movie - the audience surrogate into a maze of ghastly ritual murder. Craig channels the confident arrogance of a journalist who has stumbled onto a criminal conspiracy and hes good too at playing the characters casually brutal attitude toward women. When he takes up with Lisbeth their carnal -- but still tender -- affair injects passion into this chilly movie. But will this lifelong womanizer realize the profound effect hes having on this damaged young loner? In adapting Larssons novel screenwriter Steven Zaillian has streamlined subplots and supporting players for the sake of clarity but he doesnt short-change the central relationship at the heart of the story. Every aspect of this superbly made film is precise from the remarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to the gorgeous widescreen compositions by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth. But the impeccable technique doesnt get in the way of the protagonists messy emotions. The movie is fastidious but it still radiates an ice-cold heat. With its heavy reliance on photographs computer screens and old newspaper clippings The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is tailor-made for Fincher who previously turned Zodiac into a masterpiece of police procedural and investigation and elevated the serial-killer thriller into the realm of high art with Seven. A  famously obsessive filmmaker Fincher is fascinated by research and detail and you share the excitement Mikael and Lisbeth feel as they piece together the clues to a seemingly unsolvable crime. Beneath its macabre surface The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an immensely playful movie Leave it to Fincher to use Enyas airy Orinoco Flow as a paean to sinister evil or turn the sight of a dead cat into gruesome nightmare fodder. The films astounding opening credits too are the work of an artist in a cheerfully dark mood. But the movie doesnt take Lisbeths pain for granted and after the central story has come to an end the film hangs around to give Lisbeth bittersweet closure just like the novel did. Ive heard complaints that the last 15 minutes of  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo feel superfluous and anti-climactic. But that criticism only implies that those people focused on all the wrong things in the movie. Thats nothing new for Fincher whose pictures are often far more complex and deeper than they initially seem. This is a fabulously sinister entertainment that creeps you out and breaks your heart too and it blows away the Swedish-language film in every way including a couple of new ones you never even considered.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Our Picks Stieg Larsson The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Thrillers Entertainment News Rooney Mara in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" Theres no question that David Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian have found a degree of depth and subtlety in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" that Im not sure Stieg Larsson knew was in there. As always with Fincher you get a beautifully engineered production where even at an unwieldy 158 minutes every shot and every ominous sound cue are there for a reason. Among living Hollywood directors only Martin Scorsese is Finchers equal for meticulous brilliance. Given the sprawling procedural novel to which the filmmakers had to remain faithful (mostly) this is an ingenious and engrossing work of pop cinema. That said when it was over I felt a wave of ennui wash over me upon reflecting that weve got two more of these to go. Do we really need an entire new series of these films? (Sure the marketplace will provide an answer but that might not be the only answer.) And do we really want Fincher devoting the peak years of his career not to mention a significant portion of his mortal existence working his way through the pulpy twists and turns of this franchise?Surprisingly one of the biggest improvements over Niels Arden Oplevs 2009 Swedish-language version (which in fairness is pretty good -- a whole lot better than its successors) lies in the acting. Rooney Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth Salander the damaged aggressive computer geek and feminist revenge angel playing the character as far more feral and vulnerable than Noomi Rapaces borderline-stereotype sexpot Goth girl. And Daniel Craig leaves his Bond manner and wardrobe at home playing disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist as a wry bespectacled middle-aged dad who never considers the idea of being Lisbeths sexual partner until it happens and never seems at ease with it after that. I like Michael Nyqvist the Swedish actor who played Blomkvist in the first series but theres a reason hes moved on to playing Hollywood villains. Theres a bit too much wolfish swagger about Nyqvist a bit too much leather jacket a bit too much confidence that he can outdrink younger guys and bag younger women. Craig can certainly turn on the masculine charm as required but his Blomkvist is a driven professional in search of redemption not a wallowing Hemingway romantic.Surely theres somebody out there who hasnt read the book or seen the previous movie and doesnt know the story. On the other hand maybe not; my usual focus group consists of my mother and my mother-in-law and theyve both read it. Lets cut to the chase by saying that Fincher and Zaillian remain generally true to Larssons novel while perhaps rearranging its emphasis a bit but also that -- as you may have heard O frequenter of the Internet -- they have indeed crafted a clever new solution to the central mystery as well as a final scene thats quite different from the Oplev film (but closer to the novel). No doubt all sorts of people will complain for all sorts of reasons. In my view the rewrite is a canny adjustment far more in keeping with the nature of the characters and a solution Larsson -- who was a terrific storyteller if an indifferent writer -- might well have approved of were he around to do so.Undone by his own sloppiness and facing a major libel judgment Craigs Blomkvist walks away from his investigative magazine and his long-running relationship with Erika (Robin Wright) his married editor. He goes into a bar orders a coffee and a pack of Marlboro Reds smokes one and throws the pack in the trash -- exactly one of those character-defining actions Fincher handles so exquisitely. Thats when he gets the call from a shadowy lawyer who works for Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) an aging reclusive tycoon who just happens to be the former boss of the guy who ruined Blomkvists career. As we already know Vangers people have employed Lisbeth to compile a confidential and not necessarily legal report on Blomkvist. (She doesnt think he performs cunnilingus on Erika often enough.)While Blomkvist begins to investigate the presumed murder of Vangers beloved great-niece 40 years earlier -- she disappeared from the remote family-owned island Vanger describes as a nest of thieves misers bullies and Nazis -- Lisbeth is in Stockholm battling skinheads on the subway and wreaking vengeance on Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen) her abusive guardian. I realize that Lisbeths brutal rape by Bjurman and the equally cruel and violent payback are supposed to be crucial moments in her life and her story. Furthermore I think I get the point In a corrupt and chaotic universe you have to fight fire with fire and those with no power must find a way to get it by any means and at any cost. But the whole knife-edge equation between Lisbeth as victim and Lisbeth as avenger both on the page and in both screen versions is simultaneously too schematic and more than a little queasy-making. You Might Also Like With her pale eyebrows shapeless clothing and careless haircut Maras Lisbeth is quite a different creation from the one in the Swedish movies and much closer to the literary heroine. She craves attention and deflects it with almost every gesture and her hard shell cant conceal the fact that her emotions are too close to the surface. Her awkward manner along with her photographic memory and exaggerated computational skills suggest the possibility of an autism-spectrum disorder. When she decides to go to bed with Blomkvist once theyre finally united on Vangers Nazi-infected island she simply takes off her clothes comes into his room and gets on top of him. Of course most of us know its coming but I still felt almost as surprised as Blomkvist does.Finchers not the kind of director to leave a psychological detail unnoticed and I think he uses the sex scenes between Blomkvist and Lisbeth to disquiet us as much as turn us on. Almost a hostile stick figure with her clothes on Maras Lisbeth is a voluptuous spectacular nude and Blomkvist literally cant believe his good luck. (Discussion of Maras nude scenes has returned the word ""merkin"" to the popular lexicon and surely thats a win for everybody.) Nor does he trust it; in a subtle but significant departure from Larssons book it is Mikael rather than Lisbeth who remains emotionally distant uncertain about the prospect of true love with a whack-job nearly young enough to be his daughter. The case of the long-missing Harriet Vanger turns out of course to open up a whole series of gruesome biblically themed murders of women that the Swedish cops have pretty much bungled or ignored. But isnt it nice that Harriets brother Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) who now runs the Vanger company is being so helpful and giving our investigators everything they need? Rather quietly and in late middle age Skarsgard has become one of the most reliable and charismatic performers in world cinema capable of elevating mediocre material by his presence. (If you havent seen his hilarious starring role in the Norwegian film ""A Somewhat Gentle Man"" do so immediately.) Unfortunately by the time Martin appears ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" has indeed lapsed into the kind of middling whodunit where long-hidden clues are distressingly easy to find and the villain takes a long timeout Goldfinger-style to explain his motives before he kills you.As mentioned I really do like the way Fincher and Zaillian wrap things up and even during the movies slower patches cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth (who also shot Finchers ""Social Network"") delivers spectacular images of the Scandinavian winter and the severe interiors. Finchers movies always have density and atmosphere to burn and those things are arguably the point of the Millennium trilogy more than its frankly nonsensical story line. This is an immersive and powerful thriller driven by terrific leading performances. Its mostly really good and then it wears out its welcome. Now seriously cant we quit while were ahead? Im not sure I can stand two more rounds with Lisbeth and Blomkvist (and a pile of villains we havent even met yet) not to mention sit through two more movies made in that deadly ""international style"" where everybody speaks English with a Nordic-Slavic Greta Garbo-meets-Ingmar Bergman accent. (Craig doesnt even do that although other Anglophones in the cast do including Mara Wright and Plummer.) The Nazi-Soviet woman-hating butler did it. Is that good enough? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Still solid rehashes Swedish film |       NJ.com comments The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Still solid rehashes Swedish film Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 20 2011 at 756 AM View/Post Comments David Fincher is a fascinating director. Because he seems to be several different directors. How could the same filmmaker who made ""Seven"" make ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button?"" How does the same artist turn out ""The Social Network"" and ""Zodiac?"" The only thing his films seem to have in common is their demanding attention to detail. Their eclecticism is probably due to the fact that unlike many directors we think of as auteurs -- the Coen brothers Martin Scorsese Quentin Tarantino -- Fincher neither writes his own scripts nor works with the same handful of writers. His starting point is always different -- and thats what makes his films different giving ""Button"" the addled optimism of ""Forest Gump"" and ""Fight Club"" the nihilism of a punk record. His latest ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is like all Fincher films meticulously made; its also mostly faithful to the source material (although be prepared for a twist in the end). Yet theres already been a faithful adaptation of the novel in Swedish. So what was the point of doing another one? A simple reason best expressed in dollar signs -- American audiences dont like subtitles and they do like familiar stars like Daniel Craig. But is Finchers film any better? Not really. The story for nonfans is a series of interlocking mysteries. A journalist having just lost a major libel suit is still trying to prove his case against the litigious mogul. A millionaire near the end of his life is trying to solve a 35-year-old crime. And a punky emotionally damaged hacker is just trying to survive. In the end each of them will help the other -- and all of them will get what they want. Unfortunately Craig is a nagging disappointment as the reporter; hes as monochromatically glum as an overcast sky and while every other actor is using a slight Swedish accent he stubbornly sticks to his British one. (A nagging annoyance; in films like this actors should either all use their own accents or adopt a single one.) Rooney Mara though is fiercely compelling as the heroic -- if possibly sociopathic -- Lisbeth. And the veteran Christopher Plummer adds some saving humanity to the tale as the elderly uncle who only wants to find out what happened to his favorite niece. The story of course can use all the humanity it can get. Like the original novel its a long and often very-hard-to-watch exercise in sexual abuse torture and murder; like the original film it features graphic rapes and horrifying images. Some merely startling images too. The film begins with a credits sequence -- all Led Zeppelin metal and naked bodies writhing in crude oil -- that wouldnt feel out of place in a James Bond film; later landscapes make much of the grays and whites of wintry Sweden. Fincher has always had a wonderful eye and he brings it to sharp focus on this story. But this story has been told before and -- as in the first film -- it takes far too long to wrap up. Of course millions of Americans never saw the original adaptation; many millions more will see this one (and get a terrific introduction to the fearless Mara -- the cool ex-girlfriend in ""The Social Network"" -- already demonstrating an enormous range). And what theyll see is a solidly crafted creepily suspenseful thriller. But they wont see the one thing David Fincher used to reliably deliver. They wont see anything new. Ratings note The film contains graphic sexual abuse gory violence and strong language. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (R) Sony (158 min.) Directed by David Fincher.

His fascination with dark material and masterful technical skills serve him well in the remake of 2009s Swedish-language Girl With the Dragon Tattoo based on the popular pulp thriller. This first in Stieg Larssons Millennium trilogy was the best of the three Swedish-made films and the tautly stylish American version compares favorably with the original adaptation.STORY Rooney Mara Daniel Craig put their marks on TattooEven though the story is familiar -- the book sold 65 million copies -- Finchers take on the creepy yarn has his unmistakable stamp starting with the opening credits.The movie draws us in right away with a mesmerizing title sequence set to Trent Reznors eerie cover of Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song.About the movieThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo   1/2 out of fourStars Rooney Mara Daniel Craig Christopher Plummer Stellan Skarsgard Robin Wright Director David FincherDistributor Sony Pictures Rating R for brutal violent content including rape and torture strong sexuality graphic nudity and language Running time 2 hours 40 minutes Opens Tuesday nationwideFollowing a libel suit disgraced investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is hired by industrialist and family patriarch Henrik Vanger (a pitch-perfect Christopher Plummer) whose beloved teenage niece Harriet disappeared in 1966. Blomkvist enlists ace computer researcher Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to assist him. Together they uncover a series of disturbing developments leading to a particularly depraved serial killer.As Blomkvist and Salander learn about the sordid affairs of the dysfunctional Vanger family they become the targets of the villainy. Salander is also brutally abused by the man assigned as her legal guardian.Though deja vu is inevitable -- the Swedish version was in U.S. theaters only last year -- Fincher adds stylistic flourishes and makes intriguing changes to the story.Craig shines in the role of the steely-smart and bitter career journalist.Mara doesnt fare as well in the title role as Noomi Rapace did in the original. As the victimized but feisty computer hacker she looks the part with her Goth style. But theres a fragility to her portrayal that undermines the more vicious acts of defiance Salander pulls off.But the sum of the parts -- an evocative mood haunting music and exceptional ensemble cast -- is superbly sinister. Fincher handles the most lurid aspects deftly capturing menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is too frigid Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is too frigidDavid Finchers The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo loses what made the books and Swedish films so successful a Lisbeth Salanders humanity.December 20 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Rooney Mara stars in the U.S. film version of the hit novel. (Merrick Morton / Columbia...)Its not like ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was ever going to be ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."" Not even close. As readers of the Stieg Larsson novel and viewers of the recent Swedish film version know all too well whats on offer is a bleak and savage story of crime and punishment that features generous portions of sadistic rape twisted torture and murders that can charitably be called grotesque. Still adding David Fincher a the director of ""Seven"" ""Zodiac"" and ""Fight Club"" a to the mix has proved counterproductive. Fincher is without doubt a gifted uncompromising filmmaker with enviable skill and exceptional collaborators here including screenwriter Steven Zaillian and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth. And as the director says of his films in his press bio ""He hopes that people like them but if they dont its not for lack of effort."" Though Finchers gift for disturbing twist-the-knife cinema made him the obvious Hollywood choice using him here feels in a coals-to-Newcastle way like shipping truckloads of ice to the far reaches of the polar regions. More than that it betrays a misunderstanding of whats at the heart of the phenomenal international success of the Millennium trilogy books which clock in at 65 million copies and counting. That would be the character of Lisbeth Salander one of the most unlikely idiosyncratic and compelling crime fighters to hit the scene since Sherlock Holmes. One reason Salander is catnip on the page is that she is anything but in real life. Antisocial when shes not downright furious a sullen 24-year-old computer hacker with more piercings than friends she is fierce furtive and feral. You never want to get in her way. Though less well-crafted than the Fincher version Niel Arden Oplevs ""Dragon Tattoo"" did have the crucial advantage of actress Noomi Rapace. Her savage Salander was as skittish and tattooed as she should be but there was always a sense of an actual person inside those fierce defenses that enabled audiences to connect on screen in the way readers do on the page. Playing Salander this time around is Rooney Mara an intense young actress who had a fine scene with Jesse Eisenbergs Mark Zuckerberg at the opening of Finchers excellent ""The Social Network."" She committed herself totally to the ""Dragon Tattoo"" role and clearly did everything her director asked of her but this films cold almost robotic conception of Salander as a twitchy anorexic waif feels more like a stunt than a complete character and so the best part of the reason we care enough to endure all that mayhem has gone away. Before Salander appears on the scene ""Dragon Tattoo"" introduces its nominal protagonist Millennium magazine journalist Mikael Blomkvist played with relentless surliness by an effective Daniel Craig. A crusader for truth against the bloated capitalists of the world (and likely Larssons version of himself) Blomkvist is not having the best of days. The journalist has found himself on the losing end of a libel verdict. Facing imprisonment and wanting to take a break from his magazine Blomkvist is receptive when he gets a phone call from an attorney saying that one of Swedens most powerful men wants to see him. That would be Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) a retired industrialist who lives on the family-owned Hedeby Island a few hours north of Stockholm and has in his own words ""spent half of my life investigating the events of a single day."" Those events which have something of the flavor of a classic locked-room mystery involve the disappearance of Vangers favorite niece Harriet. On the day in question when a bridge accident made leaving the island impossible 16-year-old Harriet simply vanished. Vanger not only suspects she was murdered he thinks it was done by a member of his family and he wants Blomkvist to put his investigative reporting skills to work finding the truth. So the journalist moves into a frigid cabin on the island abandoning his it-works-for-us relationship with his married publisher (Robin Wright) and starts making charts and tacking photos onto the wall like he was one of the hard-core Baltimore cops on ""The Wire."" Circumstances soon make Blomkvist aware of Salander and her particular skill set and he convinces her to work with him. She is having deep troubles of her own including a vicious sexual predator who thinks she is an easy mark (ha). The Salander-Blomkvist collaboration is good for both them and the film. Screenwriter Zaillian has adroitly pared down the 500-plus-page book (the chatter about a change to the ending is a tempest in a teapot) and whats on screen also benefits from the work of ""Social Network"" collaborators including production designer Donald Graham Burt editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall and composers Trent Reznor amp; Atticus Ross. But unlike that film which profited from Eisenbergs humanity in a not particularly human role ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is too frigid around the heart to be really effective. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Dead Man Down twists itself into knotsMarch 7 2013Movie review Tanner HallSeptember 9 2011Movie review The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets NestOctober 29 2010New on DVDOctober 24 2010Noomi Rapaces grip on a gripping roleJuly 14 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies72hEntertainmentLisbeth SalanderCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-20111220,0,4091753.story?track=rss",200,thegirlwiththedragontattoo(2011)20,thegirlwiththedragontattoo(2011),latimes

(AP) ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is as youd expect rubbish but the word is slightly too kind. The David Fincher film (like the very similar Swedish one -- released in the US just last year -- and the book) is not even good rubbish. It demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting badly written psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story so long as you allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis. In much the same way you could consume a greasy mound of animal fat put a sprig of parsley on top and proclaim that youve eaten a balanced meal. The basic story hasnt changed crusading Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a dopey and scowling Daniel Craig) has just lost a libel suit against an evil corporation. (He ran a story based on a single anonymous source whose identity even he apparently didnt know -- lets hear it for hero journalists) Hes hired by a wealthy industrialist (Christopher Plummer) whose teen great-niece Harriet disappeared in 1966 and is presumed dead. Each year though a present of the kind she used to send him arrives in the mail. Youd think that after a few decades of this an old man would give up but it turns out the geezer has been waiting all this time for a crusading journo to show up and Blomkvist is just the reporter he needs to solve the mystery. Helpful to Blomkvists investigation is that the final hours of this ordinary girl were as extensively photographed as JFKs fateful day in Dallas and none of this evidence has been misplaced in all these years. Before he gets hired though a junior supersleuth the dorsally adorned Goth genius of the title Lisbeth Salander has been hired by the family to do an astoundingly thorough background check on him. Shes a hacker and spy who even knows all about the manner in which he makes whoopie with his boss and shagfellow (Robin Wright). We know shes a genius because she has Bobby Fischer books lying around and can memorize a tabletops worth of scattered documents at a glance although she is not bright enough not to enter the apartment alone of a scumbag who has already coerced her into sex. Because this is a thriller we need some love scenes icky as they may be. Blomkvist hires her as his researcher and is nonplussed to find her stripping naked and jumping his bones. There is no psychological setup for this no explanation for why she who has a long history of being abused by older males would be into him (initially she is more into girls) or why he with his office girlfriend and daughter almost Lisbeths age would feel OK about this. Its just weird. Its Joe-Biden-tongue-wrestling-Hillary-Clinton weird. As Lisbeth Rooney Mara disappears into the role (it helps that we barely knew her before; she was in ""The Social Network"" for a few minutes). Shes fiercely committed and not to be messed with. (Which is another reason its so odd Blomkvist would do exactly this). The scenes of her dueling with her repulsive legal guardian a puffy perv who controls her access to money and intends to make her his sex slave are effectively grotesque and terrifying. But the distance between these scenes and sadistic porn is about as thick as a tattoo. Some movies make you feel. This one makes you feel like a shower. Ill give Fincher credit for keeping things ripping along so quickly but lets not make a virtue out of necessity. His point is to speed past how much dumb and/or absurd stuff is happening. Seriously who when getting grazed by a bullet continues on with everyday business instead of trying to find out who is shooting at him? Who leaves his secret torture chamber unsecured? Once the hype dies this movie will be best enjoyed as a drinking game. Down a shot of Absolut every time Craig whips his glasses on or off and youll be blitzed by the halfway point. When he cant figure out an excuse to do that he does bizarre things with the specs such as leaving them dangling beneath his face like a chin strap. The poor man is under the delusion that eyewear can make anything here seem intelligent.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There is no director more ideally suited to adapt Stieg Larssons best-selling potboiler The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo than David Fincher and not just for the obvious reason that he knows his way around the serial-killer thriller. Hes equally adept at taking unwieldy chunks of exposition--like the lawsuits over the founding of Facebook or the leads (and blind alleys) in the investigation of the Zodiac killer or the gnarled family tree in Larssons book--and making it look like cinema of the first order. The real question is this Is the material worthy of him? Though films like Seven and Zodiac are tense stylish beautifully crafted thrillers they also have deeper thematic undercurrents questions about the existential value of living in a sinful inhospitable world or the nature and consequences of obsession. By contrast The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is all surface--magnificent arresting surface but surface all the same. A typically Fincherian hero--the loner who retreats from family and society to burrow into a project--Daniel Craig stars as a Swedish journalist who seizes the chance to pivot out of highly publicized libel suit and into something new. Christopher Plummer as the retired CEO of a large corporation summons Craig to a remote island where he and members of his family live in luxury and more often than not bitter estrangement. Plummer wants Craig to document the familys history but the focus of his investigation turns to the disappearance (and likely murder) of Plummers grand-niece 36 years earlier. As the case grows more complicated Craig brings on an unconventional but brilliant research assistant in Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) a young woman coarsened by her horrific experiences within the social system. Fincher and his screenwriter Steven Zaillian have done little to tighten up the bookends of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which perspires a little in the first-act build-up and huffs through an unusually long denouement. But the film hits a nice groove in the interplay between Craig and Mara together and apart and Fincher displays his usual mastery at explicating the finer points of an investigation. Maras Salander is the films lifeblood a shrewd yet vulnerable outsider whose resilience and pluck help Fincher elevate The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo above the standard procedural. But just barely.

Starring Daniel Craig Rooney Mara Stellan Skarsgard and Christopher Plummer. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 158 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For months people have asked ""Why do we need an English-language remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ""? The Swedish version was already an international hit not to mention a tough act to follow. Why bother? The best answer to that question is the high quality of this movie. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian do right by ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" They dont ignore the original movie or reinvent it or try to copy it. They build on it. They maintain the originals contemplative methodical tone its feeling of expanse its illusion that the filmmakers are taking their time even though something pertinent is happening every moment onscreen. But they add emotional nuance. They point scenes and accent certain relationships shorten certain interludes and lengthen others. The resulting film is neither better nor worse than the Swedish film but its more cinematic. The Swedish version was originally made for television and seen in installments. Finchers movie is 158 minutes and meant to be seen in one shot - and thats precisely how those 158 minutes go by in a shot. There is not a wasted scene or a single minute where the movie drags. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" harmonizes the languor of television with the urgency of cinema an achievement in itself.

Daniel Craig is Mikael a left-wing Swedish journalist who has just lost a libel case in court having been set up for a fall. A cold case Needing to get out of town and with nothing better to do he accepts the offer of an old business magnate (Christopher Plummer) to investigate a case thats been cold for more than 40 years. In the mid-60s the magnates teenage niece disappeared without a trace no remains ever found no murderer ever caught. Mikael has to try to find the murderer who is almost certainly a member of the magnates own family. Related Stories The new Girl gets the crime drama right Meanwhile the title character Lisbeth goes about her life as a computer hacker freelancing as a researcher and dealing with a new parole officer. For those familiar with the Swedish versions of the Stieg Larsson trilogy the idea of anyone besides Noomi Rapace in this role may be unthinkable. But Rooney Mara brings her own quality to this tattooed heavily pierced omnisexual loner making her slightly less feral slightly more vulnerable. Language issue In keeping the setting in Sweden (the right choice) Fincher and Zaillian had to confront the language issue. What was decided was to have most of the characters speak with a hint of Swedish inflection (with the exception of Craig who speaks in his own English accent). These almost accents are slightly distracting at first particularly when the actor is someone we know such as Robin Wright who plays an editor at Mikaels magazine and his occasional lover. But the strangeness fades. Craig looks like James Bond when he takes his shirt off but with his clothes on hes convincing as a professionally embarrassed journalist who digs himself out of one hole and right into another (and knows it) when he gets the taste of a good story in his mouth. Larssons superbly crafted mystery is the solid foundation upon which the film rests. Fincher augments the references to the past with wordless flashbacks to the 1960s like shards of memory. It should be no surprise that the increasing luridness of the story as it unfolds is a natural for the director of ""Se7en."" Behind Larssons saga of a bad family and its innocent victims is a metaphor for the spiritual bankruptcy and rapaciousness of entrenched wealth but while that may have some resonance its not what makes ""The Girl"" so effective. Sometimes a movie is no more important than it should be and the satisfaction it gives is entirely a consequence of its being exceptionally well made - in casting and conception in story and plotting and in the moment-by-moment execution. This is one of them. In a way its just a crime movie but you will come away remembering Craig and Mara and the meeting of these opposites; and Craig and Wright and the shared past they suggest; and Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard as odd patricians living in Swedens remote and desolate north. Youll remember the movies people and their world. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

One of the most important questions to be asked in the late Swedish authors mega-selling mystery The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo - the line ""Do you want a coffee?"" - makes it into David Finchers movie. Slideshow On Movies Little-known actress about to get famous Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo >> In fact this beautifully taut and terrifying thriller is faithful to its source in just about every way that matters. Perhaps the opening title sequence - a kind of Mapplethorpe-meets-Bond Samp;M whir set to Karen Os urgent take of Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" - is too much. But like all those signature 007 openings this one has the feel of a franchise about it so there have to be two sequels now right? (Maybe three if the hard drive on Larssons laptop has anything to say about it.) Set in Stockholm and on the frozen island of Hedeby with its cluster of grand estates and quirky cottages belonging to the rich and totally messed-up Vanger clan The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo digs its mitts into the twisted matter of Larssons elaborate whodunit. And it introduces a formidable talent - Rooney Mara whom Fincher gave a small role in The Social Network (as the girl who dumps Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg). Mara pierced and punked-out is Lisbeth Salander the asocial bisexual genius hacker and misfit - one of the great heroines of detective fiction as different from Miss Marple as a toot of crank is to a nice cup of tea. If youve seen the Swedish film adaptations of the Millennium Trilogy and thought no one could inhabit Lisbeth like their star Noomi Rapace well think again. Mara nails this damaged determined soul - you can see it in her quick sad eyes in the cool but nervous manner by which she takes everything in. Lisbeths rage her pain her intelligence - its all here. And speaking of James Bond Daniel Craig sheds the suave Her Majestys Secret Service airs to play Mikael Blomkvist. The intrepid investigative reporter has landed himself in a libel suit - publishing an apparently erroneous expose of a Swedish tycoon - thereby bringing shame on himself and his magazine Millennium and its publisher Erika Berger (Robin Wright) who also happens to be his lover even though she is married and her husband is all right with that. (Hey hey its Sweden) Craig brings a bookish verve to his performance doing this weird thing with his eyeglasses letting them dangle from one ear as he pores over problematic pieces of evidence. And on the off-chance that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is new to you the case that he - and then Lisbeth too - is investigating revolves around the disappearance from Hedeby four decades earlier of a teenage girl one of the moneyed Vanger brood. It is Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) the aging Swedish industrialist (and the girls great-uncle) who asks Blomkvist to look into what he believes to be a murder. And as Blomkvist and Salander poke around it is the serial murders of many many women that they uncover. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is very much about evil - evil rooted in family in national identity and evil that manifests itself in sexual abuse and misogyny. Never forget The original Swedish title for Larssons book was Men Who Hate Women. Fincher who has explored the psychology and pathology of serial killers in both Seven and Zodiac is in absolute control here even when things veer out of control for his protagonists. The rape scenes - there are two one with Lisbeth as victim one as avenger - are unrelentingly graphic but not for a second are they exploitive. (Fincher and Steven Zaillian the screenwriter have eliminated some of the books more tangled subplots and made one change that while significant doesnt compromise the integrity or purpose of Larssons story.) And theres a wonderful sense of place in this film too the sleek cafes and architecture of Stockholm the cold majesty of the provinces to the north the houses with their bright-colored doors. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is long but doesnt feel so. In fact toward the end it feels unnecessarily hurried as mysteries are resolved and as Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist start to look like an item - the middle-aged journo and the young cyber-sleuth who has saved him as he has saved her.

(Merrick Morton) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday December 20 2011 1200 PM Title The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Film Info With Daniel Craig Rooney Mara. A journalist and a computer hacker uncover a serial killer. Director; David Fincher (240) R Violence sexuality nudity language. At area theaters. Theres an inkling of David Finchers past in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Like ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" this eagerly anticipated thriller involves a serial killer an investigation and unsavory goings-on. Cut the seediness and Nordic ennui though and this cold-case mystery based on the late Stieg Larssons international bestseller is a common pop-cult commodity. Fincher does do something unexpected with his version of the story (an earlier version was filmed several years ago in Larssons native Sweden) and its shocking He gives in to its mimicry of an Agatha Christie parlor game. Only instead of Miss Marple the old-gal crime-solver with piercing blue eyes we get Lisbeth Salander pierced goth-girl investigator with raccoon eyes. Yet if the reptilian Lisbeth werent played by Rooney Mara in a performance that both repels and attracts Finchers film with its chilly esthetics would seem as calculated as a Michael Crichton thriller of the 90s. But Mara keeps us entranced even when we want to look away. Lisbeth as millions of readers know is the troubled victim-avenger hired by a security firm to research Mikael Blomkvist (a taut Daniel Craig) a crusading journalist investigating a decades-old murder. Elderly Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) claims hes being taunted by the killer of his beloved niece Harriet whose disappearance in the 1960s Vanger believes is linked to one of his family members (which include Stellan Skarsgard as the oiliest one). Blomkvist calls Lisbeth an expert hacker for help. The duo chip away at old photographs and dusty letters to discover a serial murderer who may still be on the Vangers hard-to-reach island -- and may still be busy with female victims. The build-up to their snooping and sexual partnership is excruciating for several reasons Along the way theres horrific abuse and rape a dull backstory involving Blomkvists damaged income and interviews with the Vangers -- some of whom are Nazis others just nasty. Once Mara and Craig come together the movie comes alive -- but even then theres a surprising lack of ferocity from Fincher. After ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and last years ""The Social Network"" you would expect this fearless often brilliant director to resist a book-to-film adaptation (courtesy of writer Steven Zaillian) so rigidly formal. Yet thats what ""Dragon Tattoo"" is from its beyond-the-grave-postal deliveries to the ""heres why I did it"" confession. Theres a noiseless creep through a glass-walled house as Blomkvist seeks evidence but even that while professional comes off as contrived. Only Mara makes an impression. An actress (and descendant of the New York Giants owners) known as the girl who prompts Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook in ""Social Network"" she has a growl that makes her petite frame a cloaking device for her rage. Its a brilliant fake-out. When Mara gives glimpses of Lisbeths humanity ""Dragon Tattoo"" becomes finally more than just a grisly paint-by-numbers from the land of ice and snow. Magic Moment Lisbeth fighting a thug who steals her bag on an escalator shows tough things can come in small packages.

Chris Vognar Follow chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Culture Published 19 December 2011 0406 PM Updated 20 December 2011 1043 AM Related Rooney Mara welcomes challenge of Dragon Tattoo Photos Dragon Tattoos new girl Rooney Mara shines in the punk hacker role Showtimes for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Projects and directors are rarely better matched than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and David Fincher. With its pulpy roots and sinister worldview Tattoo is ready-made for huge doses of dread. And no one does dread like Hollywoods reigning Prince of Darkness.Tattoo is one of those unlikely but undeniable cultural phenomenons with which even agnostics are probably a little familiar. The first leg of the late Swedish author Stieg Larssons Millennium trilogy flew off bookstore shelves then found a larger audience through an acclaimed 2009 international film version. Now it has the good fortune of spawning a Hollywood remake that wont make fans cringe (though you may ask yourself ""Why do all these Swedes speak nothing but English?"" Hegemony Its whats for dinner).Fincher is the first reason for you to get tattooed. Handed a murder investigation story dense in chilly ambience he responds like the happy Goth kid who gets a spider in his stocking. Tattoo has a darkly layered visual atmosphere you could probably chew. The snowy Swedish island and dank manor where much of the action occurs feel like places where light has gone to slowly die. When things go bump in the night here they raise the hair on the back of your neck.Then theres the remakes ace in the hole Rooney Mara. Her Lisbeth Salander the storys punk hacker hero is more ghostly less slick than Noomi Rapaces original. Sexually charged but unknowable fragile but not to be messed with shes a unique creation that stands on her own. Mara pushes aside Daniel Craig who plays Mikael Blomkvist the muckraking journalist turned murder investigator and makes the film hers.Like the original movie Tattoo takes too long to wrap up and find its climax. By that point the film has already cast its spell. Its thrilling to fall into this web of old Nazis microfilm photographs sexual perversion and hacking. As he showed with The Social Network Fincher can turn flashing computer screens and the tappity-tap of nimble fingers into a hypnotic symphony. As he showed with Seven and Zodiac hes attuned to both killers and the damaged obsessives compelled to track them. In short hes the right man for the job.A-Starring Rooney Mara Daniel Craig Stellan Skarsgard Christopher Plummer Robin Wright Joely Richardson and Goran Visnjic. Directed by David Fincher.

"Review Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Craig Mara star in sleek slick sick adaptation -- 3 starsDecember 16 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDirector David Finchers deluxe edition of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is the most coldly compelling version yet of the tale dreamed up by the late Stieg Larsson whose ""Millennium"" trilogy of pulp novels remains the time-killer of choice in airports elevated trains and when the weathers right beaches around the world.Every composition musical note furtive glance and glint of metal (whether a nipple ring or gleaming instrument of torture) serves a story purpose or adds another chilly textural detail. As with Finchers ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"" were in the land of rampant psychopathology in a world nearly beyond saving. This was the atmosphere of ""The Social Network"" Finchers previous film as well. Except that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was only making a killing not actually killing.Larssons novels have already been filmed in Swedish in three separate features (shrewdly acted indifferently directed) distributed stateside by Chicagos Music Box Films. Finchers English-language production starring Daniel Craig as investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as ace researcher and heavily pierced bisexual fantasy pin-up Lisbeth Salander was shot in many of the same forbidding Swedish locales used in the earlier films. With Fincher behind the camera the imagery is as crisp and fastidious as it gets.If theres something missing from this project scheduled to be the first in a three-film juggernaut its actually a pretty big thing a reason for being. I confess to having had enough of this story these characters this peculiarly popular narrative blend of sexual violence and serial slaughter. Around the time of ""Zodiac"" (2007) Fincher spoke to various interviewers about that storys real-life subject and his interest in filming a mystery with no satisfying conclusion and as few audience-baiting impulses as possible. He said also that after ""Zodiac"" (a financial disappointment worldwide as well as Finchers most interesting film) no one needed to make another serial killer movie. Ever.Unless theres a big pile of money in it that is. In book and film form ""Dragon Tattoo"" speaks a universal language sick thrills from a moral high-ground position. Craftily condensed into 158 minutes the adaptation by Steven Zaillian maximizes the relationship first as wary colleagues then briefly as lovers between Blomkvist and Salander. They go about nailing a killer of women and solving the riddle of a teenaged girls disappearance decades earlier. All roads icy and grim lead to a rich extended family led by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) whose relatives living on the same remote island have a tremendous amount to hide including Nazism neo-Nazism and hideous personal peccadillos. By the end ""Silence of the Lambs"" style were trapped in the lair of the worst of the worst.The film is beautifully cast. Supporting ringers such as Plummer Steven Berkoff (a business associate) Stellan Skarsgard (one of the relations) and Robin Wright (as Blomkvists magazine colleague and lover) evoke persuasive shades of righteousness and evil depending in a workable melange of Scandinavian and British dialects. Craigs journalist serves as the humble purposeful backdrop to Maras more outre character.A true survivor Salanders no more dimensionally ""human"" than was Anton Chigurh in ""No Country For Old Men"" but like Chighurh shes born for the movies -- a story hook unto herself. Whether one just admires the picture or truly digs it will probably be determined within 30 seconds of the opening-credits sequence. I resist its assaultive glamour as it morphs from black-liquid bodies melding together to fires being ignited. Its done in a way designed to elicit a Wow. Cool. ""Dragon Tattoo"" knows precisely how to achieve its look rhythm sound and spirit. Its extremely well made by a genuine and reliable talent. But I thought he was done with this sort of thing. Oh well.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Sunday Dec. 18 2011 600PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Based on a massive bestseller which has already been made into a solid Swedish film David Finchers new adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo tries to offer something fresh to audiences all too familiar with the material. Since the publication of Stieg Larssons first novel of his Millennium trilogy the story about the middle-aged investigative journalist and the punk genius-girl computer hacker has become a bit of an eye-rolling cliche. Cast member Daniel Craig arrives for the premiere of the film ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in New York December 14 2011. CARLO ALLEGRI / REUTERS Film Video Daniel Craig thrilled by the Dragon If anyone could recharge the story it should be Fincher. The director has a proven aptitude for stories of perversity and sin-obsessed serial killers ( Se7en Zodiac) and seems more than qualified to take Larssons ungainly pop-culture monster with its sick thrills and moral fervor and wrestle it into a into a taut adrenalin-delivering movie experience. Not too surprisingly Fincher doesnt bring his auteur A-game here though his crafty B-game is better than most. As well the break-out performance of Rooney Mara as the semi-feral computer hacker Lisbeth Salander gives the film a residue of authentic anguish. In contrast to Swedish actress Noomi Rapaces performance of the character which was filled with coiled defiance the waifish Mara captures Lisbeth as the wounded angry child hunched jittery and avoiding eye contact. The film as a whole feels efficient more than bold. At 158 minutes its long but never feels slow grabbing your attention right from the beginning with the barrage of jagged graphics of the opening credit sequence accompanied by Karen Os nerve-scraping cover of Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song. Steve Zaillians script gets the story in motion briskly Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) publisher of the Stockholm investigative magazine Millennium is disgraced and bankrupt when he loses a libel case brought against him by a crooked tycoon (Ulf Friberg). He soon says goodbye to his editor and casual lover Erika (Robin Wright) to take a job from a savvy old industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) who promises him both a payday and a chance to get revenge on the man who brought him down. Though the gig is ostensibly to write Vangers memoir its really about solving the decades-old disappearance of the old mans 16-year-old niece. Soon Mikael is secluded in a cottage on the Vanker familys wintry island estate where he gradually meets members of the fractious extended Vanger family of Nazis drunks and recluses (think of them as the Anti-Social Network). The most civilized of the lot appears to be Martin (Stellan Skarsgaard) who now runs the vast family company. On a separate narrative track back in Stockholm we follow the story of Lisbeth a skinny pierced punk sleuth who Vangers lawyer originally hired to do a background check on Blomkvist. At 24 but looking like a malnourished 13-year-old boy whose head has had a mishap with some hedge clippers Lisbeth is a brilliant sleuth but also a ward of the state due to supposed mental-health issues. Her obese patronizing new state-appointed guardian (Yorick van Wageningen) begins to exploit her sexually and coercion escalates to violent assault. Lisbeth responds with a rape revenge scenario that while not making a lot of practical sense has some hair-raising biblical justice. In both the scene of the rape and its matching revenge Finchers camera keeps a watchful non-prurient distance. All this sets up the eventual meeting (almost an hour and a half into the film) between the two damaged protagonists Mikael and Lisbeth when he hires her to help make sense of a series of unsolved brutal sexual murders. Craig handsome but reporter-schlubby downplays his charisma nicely to an avuncular charm in Blomkvists relationship with the prickly Salander. It is about the only human warmth the film offers. The actual sleuthing process - interviews photo analyses and unlikely leaps of logic - cant escape Larssons rudimentary plotting though Zaillian astutely snipped off some of Larssons narrative threads. The odd variety of strong weak and non-existent Swedish accents is only slightly distracting at first and eventually the speech styles seem almost a reflection of character. Curiously it is the casts major Swedish actor Skarsgaard who sounds the most American which does nothing to undermine the power of his performance. While fans may argue for years over the superiority of Team Noomi or Team Rooney Skarsgaards version of Martin Vanger tops both the book and the previous adaptation. He brings the story a much-needed sardonic zest for evil. Larssons faithful fans may demur but it seems questionable whether the Millennium novels are really worthy of the talent of Fincher and his cast for the next two films in the series. But give credit for what it is If you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear at least you can create a snazzy studded leather belt.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" opens with a howling-banshee cover of ""The Immigrant Song"" by Karen O and Trent Reznor amping up the Led Zeppelin classic to new heights of energy and angst. That remix is the ideal emblem for David Finchers wintry brutal remake of the 2009 Swedish cult sensation. Fincher pushes the tale of serial killing to the blackest depths of noir depravity. The late Steig Larssons bestseller is an epic whodunit whose heroine is only slightly less insane than the chief villain. In Lisbeth Salander Larsson created one of the most indelible sleuths in popular literature a goth street punk Einstein-level computer hacker and psychologically scarred survivor of child abuse. He plugged her into a routine police procedural tale and fried every circuit in the story as Lisbeths dark energy overwhelmed the standard detective-yarn template. Fans of the book may not recall every wrinkle of the plot but they can never forget the ferocious emotionally frozen heroine. Fincher raised eyebrows when he cast American actress Rooney Mara in the lead. Her biggest previous credit was playing Jesse Eisenbergs girlfriend in ""The Social Network"" and imagining her as a vengeful Valkyrie was quite a stretch. But his decision was nothing less than a coup. Mara dominates every scene delivering the kind of white-phosphorous performance that Heath Ledger brought to the Joker. Fincher has delved into dark-hearted subjects before sociopathy (""Seven"") sadomasochism (""Fight Club"") child endangerment (""Panic Room"") and obsession (""Zodiac""). ""Girl"" allows him to tie up all his interests in one pervy package. Behind Swedish decorum Baldur Bragason Columbia Pictures Rooney Mara stars in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" As Lisbeth and disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist research the 40-year-old disappearance of an industrialists grand-niece we realize that Swedish decorum is as thin as the veneer on an Ikea bookcase. The renowned social-welfare system breeds monsters declaring Lisbeth incompetent to handle her own affairs and assigning her to a guardian whos also a sexual predator. The court system exists to whitewash the influential and history itself has been rewritten to expunge unpleasant memories of Swedish Nazi sympathizers during World War II. Getting to the bottom of the corruption here is like peeling an onion. It never ends. The process of fact-finding and deduction is thrillingly visualized. Salander and Blomkvist create a matrix of historical photographs from the time of the girls disappearance in the 1960s. As the visual jigsaw begins to yield important clues were right there at their shoulders urging them on. Over the rocky course of their partnership Salander and Blomkvist begin to warm to one another an unlikely thaw that gives the story a new twist of emotional tension. ""Whos the killer?"" and ""Will they or wont they?"" become equally compelling questions. Daniel Craig is utterly persuasive as Blomkvist a clever man but no action hero. His flinching shock when he stumbles across a grisly sight is so quick and unexpected that we jump in our chairs even before were shown what he has seen. His attraction to the uncanny Lisbeth who mounts him repeatedly and graphically is believable and so is his hesitation at becoming deeply involved with an emotionally volatile 23-year-old genius who can hack into all his computers. As usual in a Fincher production every frame is composed with care befitting a Faberge egg. He uses space thrillingly making an open-plan modern house with glass walls into a foreboding maze and turning pleasant Swedish streets into floodgates of menace. The last scene nearly wordless is one of the great heartbreakers of modern film. With this film Fincher has made his first love story. Its a killer.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Good Director David Fincher. Cast Daniel Craig Rooney Mara Stellan Skarsgard. Rating R for brutal violent content including rape and torture strong sexuality graphic nudity and language. This weeks new movie releases Based on bestsellers Spotlight Daniel Craig Journalism in the movies Brash loud off-the-hook intense it sets the tone for David Finchers film perfectly. Based on the Stieg Larsson novel which spawned a Swedish version in 2009 the movie plays to Finchers strengths with its dark elements and cool feel combining for a bracing pop-culture experience. The story is a little too over the top a little too uneven and has at least a couple too many endings to be called great but its not for lack of trying on Finchers part. Interview David Fincher talks Dragon Qamp;A Swedish Dragon Tattoo star Rapace Or on Rooney Maras. She is magnetic as Lisbeth Salander the title character whose damaged life leads her to extremes. Also good in a much more subtle way is Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist a disgraced journalist whose shot at redemption leads to much more than he bargained for. The film opens with Blomkvists conviction on charges of libeling Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg) a billionaire financier. This threatens the future of Millennium the magazine he runs with his sometime lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright). Then Blomkvist gets an offer out of the blue from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) an industrialist whose family helped build modern Sweden He wants Blomkvist to live on the island his family has inhabited for generations and write a history of the clan and its industries. But what he really wants is the solution to a mystery. His grandniece Harriet disappeared 40 years before and Vanger is convinced that someone in the family had something to do with it. This haunts him and he wants Blomkvists help in finding out what really happened with the promise of good money and revenge against Wennerstrom. Before offering Blomkvist the job Vanger had the writers background checked -- by Lisbeth an expert hacker whose methods sometimes fall on the far side of legal. Tattooed pierced and surly she works for a security firm but does things her own way. Lisbeth has been in and out of trouble -- and mental hospitals -- most of her life after a horrific childhood. When her legal guardian has a stroke she gets a new one a sadistic animal who subjects her to degradations until finally raping her in a truly disturbing scene. Lisbeths revenge lets us know how far she will go when hurt; this scene is no less harrowing. Eventually Blomkvist finds out that Lisbeth snooped on him and he hires her to help dig up the dirt on the Vanger family a motley bunch. Besides Henrik we dont see much of the Vangers -- surviving Nazis tend to keep to themselves one supposes -- with the exception of Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) Henriks grandnephew who has been running the company. As they search for the truth about Harriet it becomes clear that there is more to the story; they appear to be on the trail of a serial killer of women. This inspires Lisbeth and she and Blomkvist grow closer as they work together. Its a unique relationship one we havent seen before and Blomkvist seems as curious about it as we are. At times he seems like more of an observer than a participant with Craig giving him a bemused sort of charm. If you havent read the book or seen the original movie you may be surprised that the film is as much about Blomkvist as it is Lisbeth if not more. But Mara brings such a punked-out intensity to every scene she is in that she takes over the film. Lisbeth isnt just looking for information about other people. Shes looking for herself looking to feel something in a world that has wounded her time and again. Maras performance has a ferocity that will linger in your mind long after the two or three endings have faded. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

In the blood-soaked hands of the hair-raising always surprising director David Fincher the creepy remake of Swedens grisly thriller The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is dreary and confusing but technically superb--a darkly photographed and superbly acted film. It is not my cup of bitter tea laced with arsenic but I admire its tenacity in keeping the viewer dazzled while the toxic effect of its violence sometimes unwatchable left me charged. I hated the 2009 Swedish film version my dashed attempt to read the book (the first volume in the crime trilogy by the late overrated Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson) put me to sleep faster than a double-dose of Dalmane and I still dont understand why it has been recycled in an estimated 100 million remake as unnecessary as it is unoriginal. It is also impossibly long-winded. When it ended after just under a whopping three hours I ended up impressed in spite of my reservations. If I had found it even half as incomprehensible as it is I might have liked it twice as much. Oh my god that plot. After being investigated for making licentious mistakes in fact-checking a magazine profile that causes a scandal the controversial complicated and egotistical journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) loses his job apartment moral compass and most of his sanity. Then he spends the rest of this interminable head-scratching thriller trying not to lose his life and everything below his gym-ready waistline and above his walnut-cracking thighs in one scene of nasty brutality after another. Hes crafty but hes also a two-fisted fool for getting recruited by Swedish industrial tycoon Henrik Vanger (a wasted Christopher Plummer) to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece Harriet who disappeared 40 years ago from a family reunion on a sinister island with an unpronounceable name off the coast of Sweden. The case was never solved but Vanger believes she was murdered by a member of his own dysfunctional family. Here the brain-twisting plot begins to get delusional. As the reporter begins to unravel multiplying clues he tracks down and hires Lisbeth Salander (newcomer Rooney Mara) a chain-smoking motorcycle-riding Goth lesbian computer hacker shrouded in black leather whose invasion of his hard drive reveals the errors that have tanked his career. This zombie is a real creep workout replete with body piercings a dragon tattoo that encircles her body and more rings around her eyes than a rabid raccoon. Sharing a deserted cottage by the sea in a gray frozen Swedish winter the reporter and his freaked-out researcher equipped with his-and-her laptops dig up newspaper reports from the year Harriet disappeared connecting an entire series of homicides and before you can yell ""Holy Whitechapel Ripper"" the Vanders turn out to be a whole family of serial killers Theres Henriks brother a Nazi who died in 1940 and the brothers son Gottfried and grandson Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) the latter two of whom continually raped and sodomized Harriet Martins sister who moved to Australia and is living under the assumed name of her cousin Anita. It takes an hour and a half before the two stars of this bizarre puzzle meet and he hires her to look up all the other women who have been murdered under similar circumstances all raped and killed all with names from the Bible and linked by verses from Leviticus. Then under pressure they end up in bed in a savage sexual fury--an unconvincing twist since Lisbeth has endured a lifetime of rape and sexual torture herself and despises men. (Weve just seen her sewing up an eye with dental floss tying up a victim and tattooing ""I AM A RAPIST PIG"" on his chest with a carving knife.) Reckless hostile and pretty close to being a serial killer herself shes seriously damaged exacting gruesome revenge on anyone who crosses her but when it comes to her boss she melts saving a naked Mr. Craig from an unbearably convincing basement torture chamber that leaves nothing to the imagination. Im a big fan of the kind of sleaze and terror David Fincher is famous for (think Se7en and Fight Club) and this is no exception. The great screenwriter Steven Zaillians elaborate convoluted script so muddled that even after its over you still dont know what its all about is a drawback--but the movie is a master class in sinister style tense and deeply uncomfortable. The cold Swedish dreamscape of blackness is so effective that sometimes you feel like you need a flashlight. Mr. Fincher also knows how to bring out the fearlessness in actors. As James Bond Mr. Craig is a terrific mixture of sarcastic charm and sartorial splendor in or out of the sack but when the role calls for something darker hes equally well equipped. Mr. Skarsgard is especially scary because of the sheer exploitation of power with which he manipulates people under the guise of polite amiable calm--making his later scenes from friendly to ferocious doubly shocking. Ms. Mara is a damaged ferret her eyes darting her tongue rubbing her stapled lips as she helps the mentally distraught reporter try to make sense of a deepening mystery. It all adds up to a noxious brew of teeth-grinding knuckle-whitening brutality.

Theres so many shots in the film where everyone will have a different take as to what is happening; great movie from this regard. My only complaint is how desensitized modern audiences must be. Though I understand moments in the film are there for a purpose and to elaborate and explain context there are some extremely explicit scenes which only hurt the film in my opinion. Not everything needs to be seen to have a great film. Watching nature unfold and actions unfold is different than those same scenes being implied but the effect on the audience will vary. But the demented parts dont enhance this film though the film is amazing by itself I found a couple scenes unnecessary in furthering the plot. How are we the viewer suppose to emphasize with the madness of the story if were expected to endure and watch what is being promoted as immoral. Explicit material should be left for the N/R category for some reason R films became pornos when in this film it doesnt even come off tasteful or even artsy. It is an amazingly well shot and orchestrated piece of work but it loses any credibility when it denies one thing to be bad and then promotes itself as such at the same time. The same goes for the lead characters. They are anti-heros/heroins in a sense. They claim what their solving to be bad yet they display morals which most would consider very much immoral. The main characters are oxymorons. And whether this was the films intention to show the double standard Im not sure but it comes off extremely hypocritical. Great cast great story intriguing and is one of the few actual suspense mysteries Ive really enjoyed. But honestly Hollywood and Finch go overboard sometimes. The movie has nudity got it I dont care but Ive never respected directors that feel they need even more extremely vulgar and inhumane scenes which are totally inappropriate and simply dont need to be seen. Though Ive watched the film twice I wont be watching it again. Well executed and intriguing and some amazing shots but a great film has re-watchability especially mysteries. If this film didnt drift into porno rape category Id probably go re watch it again right now. Cassie Hillsaid on Wednesday January 25 2012 52836 PMRichard your review is 100% accurate. This remake is remarkable and amazing Clyde Collinssaid on Saturday December 24 2011 53005 PMAside from the great story actors performances haunting soundtrack and thrilling directing from David Fincher the cinematography was what amazed me with this film. This movie should be the major point in the argument that digital cinema is not only possible but the future. The quality of image that the red camera produced for this film not only competes with 35 mm but may exceeds its abilitys. This film shows even though digital imaging is in its infancy the possibilities are very bright for the future. robin mishrasaid on Sunday December 18 2011 125523 PMI saw both The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo(2009 amp; 2001) and i want to say only that easy predictable story. Useless scenescommon story plot nothing surprise. Bob Johnsonsaid on Sunday December 18 2011 112111 AMAm anxious to see this film. I watched Swedish version 4 times my favorite movie of the year. Also read all 3 books in the trilogy before watching the three Swedish films which helped understand voids in them. Noomi was great as Lisbeth and I hope Rooney is as good or even better. Benjamin Contrerassaid on Sunday December 18 2011 45158 AMYou need to watch the original movie Its a clasic Reply from Richard Roeper Ive seen it thanks RR joe-bob elginsaid on Saturday December 17 2011 105741 PMJust like The Ropester I too was not sure that we needed an American version of TGWTDT. I am happy to hear the his review was very positive and though Rooney has a little less sex appeal as did the Swedish Lisbeth I cant wait to see this and I am going to have to read the book sometime soon. The Swedish version is an A and I cant wait to enjoy this version together with some of Valparaisos finest kernels mixed in with some of Wisconsins liquidfied yellow syrup washed down by Atlantas near perfect beverage Myrasaid on Tuesday December 13 2011 112205 PMI cant wait to see this The way that Rooney matches the book description of lisbeth and the way she seems to have understood the character is outstanding. I wish there were more books with more than one good movie adaptation like this one. I will see the Swedish version as soon as I see the Hollywood approach.

The film sees down-at-heel crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden) at the mercy of a corrupt sexually deviant parole officer.Throughout this beautifully photographed skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero but his investigative journey is a little too familiar his character too clean-cut to be compelling. Its Salander who holds the attention superbly played by Rapace shes a grim spectral presence in the opening scenes before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking vengeful violence. Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become but explicit violence only takes you so far. At heart this is a traditional thriller down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year - for the rest of us its a solid enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story.

Liked Daniel Craig but didnt connect with Rooney Mara as Lisbeth and I didnt find it as engrossing as the original.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 5 2012sugomezFeaturedI am watching the American version and it is so boring that I decided to write this comment. Where is the relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael? Where is the flow? What happened to the rape scene To Lisbeth boy-like body and to her personality? She is so disconnected and. . . scared.I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen in the Swedish version and I fell in love with Lisbeth everything about her was perfect and intentional. In my opinion only Hollywood fans can prefer this new version. Oh one more thing the mean guy is SO obvious here I was shocked. I expected to prefer the Swedish version because I like international films but this is worse than I ever thoughtFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2012critiqueFeaturedJudged on its own merits this is a pacy enjoyable thriller. Compared to the Swedish language film it is shinier and less clunky. Craig is not as bland as Nyqvist and Mara is not so fierce as Rapace. I maintain that the book would have been better served by a tv series (it may yet arrive). Three and a half stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2012NicholasFeaturedI agree with the reviewers overall assessment of the movie. And I agree with others dislike of the intense rape scene theres an awful tendency to err on the side of being explicit in movies generally when the violence could just as easily inferred. I stayed through the movie as a courtesy to my date but had I been alone I would have left.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 23 2012John CooperFeaturedWhen I go the cinema I want to see a good film . . . . . and this is a good film I dont want to see a purist adaptation of a novel which I havent read and might never read. I dont accept the `iconic` status which feminists attach to Nooni Rapaces interpretion of Salander. Rooney Mara is just as good and as some viewers have observed she makes the role her own. I urge readers to ignore comments by looney feminists such as Mrs Gubbins and other critics who cant accept that mainstream cinema has produced a superior remake. Oh yes Daniel Craig gives a great performance displaying a vulnerability that comes as a surprise after the OO7 films. I liked the Swedish version . . but  on the whole  this is better . . .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 21 2012ERIC W.FeaturedDont listen to anybody who hasnt read all 3 books.

Yet if you have then give this film a miss as it is no where as good and it be cheaper to go and buy the original on dvdFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 11 2012SuttonFeaturedA good enough film though the original is better. I was curious due to the involvement of Mr Fincher and Mr Craig. I donaEUR(tm)t think they changed it much to warrant a remake.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 9 2012mrsgubbinsFeaturedCongratulation Time Out London for once again playing your role in the side-lining and humiliation of women in film. Even the great evenging angel Lisbeth Salander is neutered and made pathetic in the shape of the dead eyed willowy Rooney Mara who couldnt threaten a pug if her life depended on it.The love story that Fincher has attempted to eke out of the Salander/Blomkvist relationship is offensive and in the poorest taste given the facts of the novel. This film is a cynical depressing farce that I urge you not to see.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 7 2012YawnFeaturedQuite why Fincher became involved in this film is unclear - unless it was for the money. Ill wager Niels Oplevs version cost a good deal less than the Hollywood version yet captures the book fantastically. Finchers version is a hollow version I thought boring and showed he had little knowledge of the geography of the region. Oplevs version captures the spirit of the book perfectly and Noomi Rapace an excellent Lisbeth - I seriously wonder how many dragon tattoos she inspired. Even Rapaces dragon tattoos better than the one Fincher/Hollywood could come up with for Rooney Mara. Avoid.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 6 2012Omri StephensonFeaturedDespite moments of visual brilliance and some good performances Finchers version of Larsons thriller is ultimately a pointless exercise. With too many loose plot strands and lingering sadistic scenes of sexual violence and torture in near monochromatic wintery scandinavian surroundings and an anti-climactic ending how does this merit cinematic entertainment?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 5 2012attic23cFeaturedAmazingly enjoyable film. If you like Zodiac youll love this and if you dont like Zodiac dont come to mine for tea. The Craig-Mara relationship is fascinating playing against gender stereotypes in an exciting and often amusing way. Having just recently read the book (N.B I havent seen the original movie) I found it to be an almost faultless adaptation encapsulating the essence of many great characters so slickly.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 4 2012MikeFeaturedBy far and away this is the superior version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Not only is the storyline better but the script is tighter the acting excellent and the photography far far superior. I saw this film shortly after it was released in 2010 and saw FincheraEUR(tm)s stab at it last week. This (Oplev) version wins hands down and was worth the purchase on DVD. Four stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 4 2012good enoughFeaturedI thought this was as good as the previous film version. I suppose any adaptation of a book can get made if there looks to be money made from it even if its very soon after another one. I thought I was going to be itching to leave half-way through after reading the running time but I actually found it interesting enough all the way through. I have to say my non-offended response might be to do with the fact that I thought the previous film was a pretty good thriller but thats all. This one was a pretty good thriller too.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 3 2012JafarFeaturedaEUR~aEUR|Dragon TattooaEUR(tm) hit the cinemas on Boxing Day only two years after the original Swedish version arrived a massive hit in its own right. Both films are based on the bestselling book written by Stieg Larsson as part of his aEUR~MillenniumaEUR(tm) trilogy. YouaEUR(tm)d have to question why Hollywood would remake a movie so soon after the original but that tells you a lot about the state of Hollywood right now. Pros and cons aside though this is a fun movie. That needs to be established. I was engaged I didnaEUR(tm)t get bored I was even leaning forward at points because I was so immersed in it. When you have a team of people that includes David Fincher Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer thataEUR(tm)s the least you should expect and it succeeds on that level. The story quickly - disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by the retired and stupidly wealthy Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find out which member of the Vanger family killed his granddaughter fifty years ago. Blomqvist agrees and quickly starts his investigation. He ends up finding out about Lisbeth Salander (Mara) a girl with incredible hacking skills and a very distinctive tattoo. She helps him with the investigation and the rest of the film is them trying to solve the case. But obviously no good film is ever as simple as that. There are lots of smaller sub-plots and character histories adding more layers to the story and pushing it beyond the typical whodunnit. While itaEUR(tm)s good those layers are there aEUR"" and IaEUR(tm)m sure the books delve much deeper aEUR"" the restricted running time means that those subplots arenaEUR(tm)t fully explored. I wonaEUR(tm)t go into spoiler territory but we have to believe characters are able to achieve things without consequence so the movie doesnaEUR(tm)t slow down. The exact same problems are there in the original Swedish version; I really wish Fincher had tried to remove those problems but he didnaEUR(tm)t. Another issue with the Swedish version was the controversy over the graphic sexual violence in the movie. ThereaEUR(tm)s graphic sexual violence in this version too and itaEUR(tm)s not for the squeamish. But frankly itaEUR(tm)s justified. Those scenes do as much a good job of building character and tone as any in the movie. But enough of where Fincher falters letaEUR(tm)s talk about where he excels. A quick IMBd search showed me that IaEUR(tm)ve seen almost every Fincher film and theyaEUR(tm)re all fucking great. The guy knows how to make a film. What he does best of all is bring out outstanding performances from actors who donaEUR(tm)t really seem suited to their role. Brad Pitt in Fight Club; Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network; and now Rooney Mara. Mara is stunningly good as Lisbeth just fantastic. Vulnerable unhinged sexy detached steely feminine aEUR"" she goes through a whole gambit of emotions without really ever saying much. ItaEUR(tm)s all in the eyes. Her partner in crime is Daniel Craig; granted this is a role weaEUR(tm)ve seen Craig do many times but thataEUR(tm)s not a shot. He does it well. But what really griped me was the fact that everybody spoke in Swedish accents except Craig. Why? It made no sense. You forget about it eventually but itaEUR(tm)s still puzzling. IaEUR(tm)m not gonna go on and on about every single cast member because itaEUR(tm)d be a waste of your time. But if you know the people on this list Christopher Plummer Stellan Skarsgard Steven Berkoff Robin WrightaEUR|then you know youaEUR(tm)re in for some great performances. The other bits of the film aEUR"" the music the cinematography the editing aEUR"" are typically brilliant. The musicaEUR(tm)s all techno-y the cinematography is all Swedish-y and the editing is all frenetic-y. And youaEUR(tm)ve got a cover of Led Zep right at the beginning which is always welcome despite the fact that the opening montage is more Bond-like than anything else. It seems out of place from the rest of the film but good visually nonetheless. There are things to fault itaEUR(tm)s not perfect film. But itaEUR(tm)s still a brilliant one. For MaraaEUR(tm)s performance alone itaEUR(tm)s worth watching. Inevitably people will compare her to the original Girl Noomi Rapace but Mara makes the character her own. Everyone else is just as great and youaEUR(tm)re left with a movie that leaves you wanting more. And conveniently we wonaEUR(tm)t be far away from more.

So I was surprised this was basically a copy of the original just inserting English speaking actors and accentuating the Lisbeth sex scenes amp; motor-bike. Seemed as pointless a remake as Let The Right One In just to save us from reading sub-titles. Rapace must be irritated by this plagiarism of her interpretation but thats HollywoodFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2011Blaize67FeaturedA superior movie from Fincher far outshining the previous Swedish version. Daniel Craig fills out the Blomkvist role showing what a fine actor he is and Rooney Mara is a revelation as Salander. In fact considering the brilliance of Noomi Rapace it is a formidable achievement for an actress to take the part and make it her own. In a way she makes the film work by a credible and exciting character presence. The directing is first rate and the cinamatograraphy flawless using the locations with great effectiveness. The rest of the cast work perfectly too with a delicious villain. One of the top 5 movies this year.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 28 2011BenFeaturedWhy the fk am I the only one here who seems to think the rape scene was WAY WAYYY too much?

What was perhaps most interesting to me was the things that this film accentuated in the sexual scenes yet glossed over others compared to the original. This perhaps says more about Hollywoods tastes and taboos than anything else. It is much heavier on the male misogyny than the lesbianism. It is graphic and no holds are barred in certain scenes. It is more glossy than the original and it is clear that a big budget offers options not available to the original director and the family all look too young and too glamorous for the roles. All this aside it is a good film. Maybe not great but well worth a viewing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2011theatre goerFeaturedOVERRATED.....slow amp; predictable......just like Congress....just doent get itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedVery good refreshing xmas release though hardly any in mid boxing day show.

This (Fincher) version adds nothing at all to the story or characters and if anything is of poorer quality aEUR"" not particularly good casting sloppy script okay photography and so on. It also seemed quite leaden towards the end and I started to look at my watch.

And I found none of the characters or situations in this at all believable. Pure comic-book characterisation topped up with graphic sex and violence. The TO reviewer says it is an ""intelligent"" film. Where? How? Film and TV makers sprinkle child sex abuse and corrupt big business into their scripts like so much seasoning these days but I think its just laziness. This film is a mediocre Hollywood wanna-be.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 31 2010MikeFeaturedLoved it as much as the book. Im stunned that Hollywoods going to make a version - why?

I also thought altering the tone of the villains end a serious dramatic mistake given the films central premise (the danger of psychopathic misogynist men in society in general). The film also sufferers from too much design; the actors barely get a chance to do more than say a couple of words or grimace before the scene changes. On the plus side at least they have had a reasonable go at rendering Lisbeth Salander.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 30 2010krisFeaturedI liked the movie quite a bit particularly the part with the angry Swedish woman running after the SUV and bashing it with a golf club. (sounds familiar I dont know why...) I thought the rape scenes were terrible though. With so much so-called complexity the rape scenes were very fake hollywood.

It opens with psychedelic music-video credits scored to Karen Os caterwauling cover of Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" that set a mood of evil dipped in black rubber. That fanfare lets you know that the movie is going to have a sensuality and danger that the 2009 Swedish screen version dutifully effective as it was did not. Directed by the high-grunge master David Fincher (Zodiac Se7en The Social Network) the new Girl With the Dragon Tattoo sticks close to the spirit and most of the details of Stieg Larssons Swedish serial-killer novel in which an officially disgraced left-wing journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is hired to investigate a homicide that has haunted an aristocratic family for 40 years. Larssons plot is nothing more (or less) than a clever conventional whodunit festooned with glimmers of depravity. Fincher however teases out the full mythological grandeur of the material. Hes not just a great director -- hes an artist with the eyes of a voyeur and he has made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo into an electrifying movie by turning the audience into addicts of the forbidden looking for the sick and twisted things we cant see. As Lisbeth Salander the sullen 24-year-old waif hacker whos the storys spectacularly outlandish heroine Rooney Mara is a revelation. She sports the spiky black plumage of a punkette peacock with oversize earrings tightened onto her lobes like gears pale-gray skin set off by barely perceptible eyebrows choppy bangs and piercings she wears like scars. Even when Lisbeth is standing still her whole look is really an act of violence an assault against decorum. Its her way of fighting to be noticed with a suppressed scream that says ""Look at me -- and stay away"" Shes like Clarice Starling crossed with Joan of Arc crossed with a homeless fingerless-gloved teen sociopath. Lisbeth who set her father on fire and has been in and out of a mental ward is placed in the ""care"" of a civil-servant parole officer named Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen) a bourgeois pig who not only treats her like a piece of meat but is supremely smug about his belief that he can get away with it. His assaults against Lisbeth rouse us to her side culminating in an all-out violation that Fincher stages with naked horror. When Lisbeth returns to seek vengeance armed with scurrilous video and a tattoo gun shes no trumped-up action heroine; shes operating out of hell-bent instinct. Mara acts with a quiet power -- a rage chilled into silence -- that is almost ghostly. Lisbeth works for a security firm that looks the other way at her laptop invasions of e-mails and corporate documents and eventually she teams up with Blomkvist. For a long time though the movie cross-cuts between the two of them. It follows Blomkvist as hes hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) the elder statesman of the Vanger clan to come to the familys frozen wintry island and investigate the murder back in 1966 of Harriet a 16-year-old member of the family who disappeared the same day as a fateful car crash on the mainland bridge. Daniel Craig edgy and alert is at his saturnine best -- though I do wish hed tried for a Swedish accent to give himself a slightly different persona than were used to. When Lisbeth comes along and joins him as a researcher the two have a wary downbeat chemistry that is so unusual its transfixing. Lisbeth sees the case as a mirror of her own victimization. Shes fighting the men who fear and loathe women. Even her superstar hacking is presented as a feminine skill a girls stealth entree into the male power structure. At the same time when she strips off her clothes and leaps into bed with the more-than-slightly-shocked Blomkvist who has an on-and-off journalist girlfriend (Robin Wright) of his own what Maras performance captures -- and what Noomi Rapaces for all her skill in the Swedish version didnt -- is that Lisbeths erotic ferocity is a product of the detached cyber-porn era. She can jump Blomkvists bones because she compartmentalizes her desires. The investigation hinges on old photographs from the day of Harriets disappearance and Fincher manipulates these enigmatic images with a frame-by-frame dexterity worthy of the Zapruder film. Slowly we watch as the victim watches the killer come into view. Who in the Vanger clan committed an unspeakable crime? The family is presented as a parade of rogues deviants misanthropes and even Nazis but really this stuff all seems a bit musty. Whats fresh in its ambiguity is the creepy-elegant performance of Stellan Skarsgard. He plays Harriets brother not to mention the Vanger descendant with by far the most spectacular kitchen -- which in a film this suspicious of old money certainly targets him as someone to be watched. Many of course will go into the movie knowing just what happens. But even if you do Fincher uses the resolution of the films crimes as a chance to stage a torture scene that is memorable in its sick-puppy majesty. I will say outright that the closest Fincher comes to genius in this film is his use of Enyas ""Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)"" as a background aria of jaunty dread. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a brilliant franchise movie but since it is a franchise movie Fincher obviously felt duty-bound to retain the books somewhat lumpy structure. Once the mystery is solved theres still a major chunk to go of thorny financial-logistical gamesmanship. Its not that this stuff is boring but it does seem like an anticlimax. What redeems it dramatically is that its all framed through the eyes of Lisbeth and Mara without going soft draws us to a quality deep inside her beyond her ability to solve a crime. By the end Lisbeth can feel something maybe a touch of tenderness. Even as she breathes fire.

Hollywood has commandeered Swedens big literary export ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" without compromising the storys Scandinavian roots or its top-of-the-world Seasonal Affective Disorder sense of barrenness even hopelessness.It could have been transplanted Stateside for American audiences but thankfully what happens in Sweden stays in Sweden in David Finchers stark but enthralling adaptation of the first novel in late author Stig Larssons trilogy.Its harsh emotional terrain where cruelty flourishes and compassion suffocates could have wound up softened and sweetened yet this was an ideal match of filmmaker and material. Finchers one of the least sentimental directors in Hollywood. If anything his ""Dragon Tattoo"" is even bleaker than the 2009 Swedish-language hit.Those preliminaries aside heres the really good news this movie kicks ass. Rooney Mara who had a small role in Finchers ""The Social Network"" gives a controlled detonation of a performance as traumatized victim-turned-avenger Lisbeth Salander. Maras the breakout star of the year a cold detached waif in form a fearsome merciless zealot in spirit.How strange it is to say that the nice guy here is Daniel Craig -- who of all the big-screen James Bonds comes closest to the nasty tortured soul Ian Fleming created.Mara and Craig make an indomitable screen pair he nominally leading their intense search into decades-old serial killings she surging ahead plowing through obstacles with flashes of phenomenal intellect and eruptions of physical fury.A ward of the state since an act of childhood violence Lisbeth has been at the mercy and mostly the malice of others for so long that she anticipates and incorporates their brutality into her own calculations for maintaining control of her life.Peerless as a computer hacker Lisbeth finds occasional employment with a security company for whom she runs a not-too-legal background check on disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig).The companys client retired industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) hires Mikael to make a last-ditch effort to find out who killed his beloved teenage grand-niece who vanished 40 years earlier.Mikael eventually persuades aloof suspicious Lisbeth -- who has every reason in the world to revile men as a loyal order of perpetrators of violence against women -- to join his investigation.The film is gripping early on when Lisbeth and Mikael are on their own. Once they team up ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" takes on a relentless though unhurried momentum as the two find links between the girls disappearance and a series of murders of young women butchered in unspeakable ways.Craig is an anchor of cool rationality and judiciousness around which Mara revolves like a demon. With her body piercings black leather and hooded jackets that seem like her version of a mad monks cowl Lisbeth tears about icy Sweden on her motorcycle wan scrawny scarier than any of the night creatures in Hollywoods glut of vampire movies.She is horribly violated by a social worker appointed as her new guardian a sickening scene balanced by Lisbeths equally bestial act of vengeance. You perversely want to cheer Lisbeth for her triumph while bemoaning the world that made her such a pitiless creature.Screenwriter Steven Zaillian an Academy Award winner for ""Schindlers List"" again adapts a dense literary work with a sharp eye for the most critical exchanges. Craig shares some delicious moments with Plummer along with Robin Wright as his lover and magazine co-owner and Stellan Skarsgard as one of the more personable members of the rather despicable Vanger clan.Rarely a filmmaker of brevity Fincher gives Zaillian room to let the story and characters reveal themselves slowly.The film could stand some surgery to nip away at the excessive repetitive sequences of discovery as Lisbeth and Mikael endlessly scan old photos files and newspaper clippings. We get that theyre ace researchers; we dont need to see so much of the paperwork.What is wonderful to see is the grand severity of the northern Sweden landscapes. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth captures the coldness of the climate and remoteness of the countryside in a tactile fashion to complement the frosty and distant nature of the characters.This is a team that deserves an encore and Larsson left behind two more novels loaded with more dark doings for Lisbeth and Mikael. We havent seen the last of this tattooed girl.""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" released by Sonys Columbia Pictures is rated R for brutal violent content including rape and torture strong sexuality graphic nudity and language.

If ever an atmosphere could be described as dank fetid yet strangely luxurious its the chill seeping through every corrosively beautiful frame of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" As classy a film as could be made from Stieg Larssons sordid page-turner David Finchers much-anticipated return to serial-killer territory is a fastidiously grim pulp entertainment that plays like a first-class train ride through progressively bleaker circles of hell. If the brooding intelligence and technical mastery on display at times feel disproportionate to the material Rooney Maras riveting take on Lisbeth Salander amply validates what will likely be Finchers biggest success to date. The global popularity of Larssons posthumously published ""Millennium"" trilogy should help the Sony release overcome a number of commercial hurdles including a no-bull R rating scenes of implied sexual assault and a pacey but unhurried 158-minute running time. That this English-lingo adaptation is arriving not long after a widely seen Swedish version (which grossed 104 million worldwide and an impressive 10 million in the U.S. last year) could hinder its international prospects to some degree but all in all the desire to see what Hollywood has wrought from Larssons literary juggernaut should entice franchise addicts casual fans and mildly curious holdouts. What theyre in for is a considerably slicker and more sophisticated piece of film craft than the Swedish production or either of its Nordic TV sequels. The film telegraphs its exceptional production values and acrid tone with one of Finchers typically arresting credits sequences a rapid-fire frenzy of images variously evoking sex violence birth technology and immolation set to a furious cover of Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" featuring Karen O. Its presumably a howl of rage from the ravaged psyche of Lisbeth Salander (Mara) the dragon-tattooed Goth girl whose black mohawk bondage gear and dont-mess-with-me attitude conceal a troubled history as well as one of Swedens great investigative minds. Hewing more faithfully to the novel than its predecessor did Steven Zaillians smartly pruned screenplay divides its time between Salander a supremely gifted hacker and professional snoop and the most recent subject of one of her expert background checks Stockholm-based magazine journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). Publicly disgraced after losing a high-profile libel case rigged by a corrupt mogul (Ulf Friberg) Blomkvist takes a powder and relocates on a whim to the remote Hedeby Island; there Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) aging patriarch of the wealthy notoriously fractious Vanger family has assigned him to find out what happened to Henriks niece Harriet who as depicted in gorgeously hued flashbacks mysteriously disappeared from the island more than 40 years ago. Blomkvist eventually unmasks not just a killer but a highly disturbing record of generational sin etched in the Vanger dynastys DNA and by extension the fabric of any Western capitalist society. Without excessively underlining the subtext the film fully retains Larssons thinly veiled indictment of corporate skulduggery anti-Semitism child abuse and above all unspeakably sadistic crimes against women (not for nothing was the novel published in Sweden under the title ""Men Who Hate Women""). Fittingly its Salander who serves as not only a victim of such violence but an avenging dark angel. To that end editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall crosscut frequently between Blomkvists investigation and a disturbing parallel narrative in which Salander a ward of the state must deal with a predatory legal advocate (Yorick van Wageningen). As with the Swedish pic the scenes in which this sadist abuses his authority will prove the most difficult to watch although here the degradation is more implied than seen shot dimly and from a well-judged distance with no hint of leering or exploitation beyond the calculated satisfaction of watching Salander turn the tables. Blomkvist eventually hires Salander as a research assistant initiating a collaboration that sets off professional and romantic sparks and brings the investigation to a boil. As the two use the latest technology to resurrect old files photos and clippings their MacBooks commanding nearly as much screentime as their faces Fincher charts their progress with unerring focus and agility; instinctively one detects reverberations of the helmers past work notably the razor-sharp techno-savvy of ""The Social Network"" and the procedural rigor of ""Zodiac."" Yet where the obsessive quest for knowledge in that 2007 film was predicated on the unknowability of the truth ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is finally let down by a yarn that contents itself with easy solutions and few lingering mysteries. For all the fetishistic attention Fincher and his crew lavish on every gruesome forensic detail theyre unable to transmute Larssons rudimentary mystery plotting into something more than pop-lit fare. What remains then is the hypnotic presence of Mara who fearlessly steps into a role made iconic by Swedish thesp Noomi Rapace and proves more than equal to the challenge. Whereas Rapace emphasized the characters pluck and rage the more petite vulnerable-looking Mara presents Salander as an emptied-out enigma Pierced to the nines her eyebrows dyed a pale skin tone so as to drain any readable emotion from her face she frequently averts her gaze downward from whomever she may be addressing. Its a gesture at once defensive and defiant bespeaking years of endured abuse and alienation yet despite her blank affect the actress charges every moment with tension and feeling. Though hes a more compelling Blomkvist than Swedish originator Michael Nyqvist Craig still makes sure to present the character as a bit of a schlump tamping down his leading-man charisma to allow Mara to decisively claim the spotlight. The duos often darkly funny rapport pays off with startling emotion in the final reels perhaps the most gratifying surprise from a filmmaker whose temperament has generally been as frigid as the films Swedish landscapes. Casting elsewhere is perfect down to the smallest roles particularly Robin Wright as Blomkvists gorgeous editor/lover; Stellan Skarsgard as Harriets genial brother Martin; and despite the excision of much of her material from the novel Geraldine James as Henriks inquisitive grandniece Cecilia. The slight variability of the ensembles Swedish accents (Craig retains his British enunciation) is a minor but not bothersome flaw. With the outstanding assistance of d.p. Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt Fincher has rendered a gray vividly creepy world in keeping with Larssons cynical vision; spanning glassy modern offices and moneyed estates as well as squalid flats and rustic cottages its a place where evil hides in plain sight and even a well-appointed apartment or an island getaway can turn out to be a sickos torture chamber. At times carrying echoes of their work on ""Social Network"" Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score blends dread with driving momentum establishing a richly unsettling mood with recurring dissonances eerie wind chimes and pulsating reverb effects.

TWITTER Rooney Mara gives a bewitching performance as Lisbeth Salander in the adaptation of Steig Larssons novel which also stars Daniel Craig. In the end theres not much extra even David Fincher can bring to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. This fastidious technically stellar Hollywood telling of one of the great literary sensations of recent times is highlighted by a bewitching performance from Rooney Mara as the punked-out computer research whiz Lisbeth Salander and remains an absorbing story as it was on the page and in the 2009 Swedish screen version. But for all the skill brought to bear on it the film offers no surprises in the way its told (aside from a neatly altered ending) and little new juice to what for some will be the third go-round with this investigation of the many skeletons in the closet of a powerful Swedish corporate family. Dedicated Fincher fans are likely to find this redo rather more conventional and less disturbing than Seven Fight Club and Zodiac all of which end far less reassuringly. Box office returns for this dark Christmas offering will certainly be big although it will be interesting to gauge if Tattoo is still as major a part of the zeitgeist as it was a year or two ago. PHOTOS 10 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years Although Niels Arden Oplevs Swedish adaptation which ran 152 minutes (180 in an extended version) was perfectly solid if not particularly stylish and boasted a fine cast there was cause to suspect that one of the best American directors now working would bring something extra to this exactingly lurid tale of a disgraced journalist and his kinky accomplice who chart the untold depths of depravity old Nazi sympathies and serial murder in the vaunted Vanger clan. From the outset its unmistakably a Fincher film; the superlatively sharp visuals the immaculate design the innate knack for melding sound and music the chill and menace evoked from both modern cities and open spaces the beautiful people marked by deep scars and flaws -- all feel part of his habitual landscape. The director and his crafty scenarist Steven Zaillian skate through the exposition so fast that if one werent already familiar with it it might be difficult to absorb it all. Very quickly we learn (or are reminded) that seasoned journo Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has his reputation and bank account wiped out by losing a libel case brought by scammy big bucks investor Wennerstrom; that Mikael has a long-term casual thing going with Erika (Robin Wright) his editor at the now-imperiled maverick journal Millennium and that with the inducement of a hefty payday and a promise of helping him nail Wennerstrom down the road he accepts a job from the Vanger family patriarch Henrik (Christopher Plummer) to privately investigate the disappearance and presumed murder of his beloved 16-year-old niece Harriet way back in 1966. VIDEOS Christopher Plummer in THRs Awards Season Actors Roundtable With the feeble cover of writing a biography of the courtly Henrik Mikael hunkers down in a chilly cottage on Henriks vast estate in the north of Sweden just after Christmas surrounded by piles of documents and a quickly filling wall of Post-Its notes and photos. He also meets assorted family members most of them suspicious of Mikael and some of them not on speaking terms with one another. The most affable of them seems to be Martin (Stellan Skarsgard) the missing Harriets brother who now runs the vast company which ""built modern Sweden"" with its industrial initiatives but is now in a downward slide. Back in Stockholm Vanger attorney Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff now resembling a cross between Anthony Hopkins and Otto Preminger) has used wild girl rogue researcher Lisbeth to check out Mikael whose computer skills are as impressive as her manners are atrocious. Festooned with multiple piercings tattoos a haircut that might pass muster in Borneo and an anti-social attitude that could clear a wide path for her through any crowd the slightly built Lisbeth remains a ward of the state whose new piggish guardian coerces her into sexual favors then rough rape in exchange for the money shes due. Her astonishing revenge clearly depicted here but not lingered over is already one for the annals. The film pushes through all these preliminaries not with haste exactly but in such a compressed way that there is little sense of lullingly enveloping the viewer into the narrative web; it just rushes you into it like the fast train that shuttles the characters between Stockholm and snowy Hedestad. Lisbeth doesnt arrive there until after the halfway point 85 minutes in enlisted by Mikael to make sense of some Biblical references and the unsolved murders of several women many years earlier while he continues to piece together the mystery of Harriets disappearance. VIDEO Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Extended Trailer As readers will know things get very hairy in the basement of one of the Vanger homes although Fincher stops short of making this as horrific as it might have been. On the other hand there is the fresh pleasure of a key interlude from the book that the Swedish film omitted that of Lisbeths eventful trip to Switzerland in disguise and the new resolution of the Harriet story is clever and plausible enough. Often unkempt and largely stripped of the political core with which Larsson equipped him Mikael is a fractionally less interesting character here than in the previous film and Craig while entirely watchable doesnt reveal much thats going on inside him beyond whats already called for on the surface. His mild Swedish inflections in early scenes soon give way to a straight English accent even as the speech of others remains consistent in a mid-North Sea sort of way. Craig and Wright play well together sparking the wish they shared more scenes. So its Maras movie for the taking and she snatches it up in dramatic fashion. Unforgettable in the opening scene of The Social Network last year she remained untested in a demanding role but Finchers belief in her is borne out in a dominating performance of submerged rage confidence and defiance. Baring all in the several sex scenes both coerced and consensual she goes all the way in a performance that compares favorably to that of Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version and its two sequels. She comes across here as the real deal. STORY Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Producer Bans New Yorker Critic From Future Screenings for Breaking Review Embargo In the astutely selected cast of largely British and Scandinavian actors Skarsgard crucially gives Martin a sociable surface Plummer exudes the required charm as the cultivated gent in charge Yorick van Wageningen has just the right piggish bulk for the loathsome rapist Joely Richardson shines as a daughter long estranged from her unsavory relatives and Berkoff handles legal and expository details with aplomb. It almost goes without saying that all the craft contributions visual and aural are exemplary. There was never any question that Fincher was the perfect director for this job; the material is right down the middle of the plate for him. But in his best and most unnerving films theres the sense of him pushing deeper darker and beyond where most filmmakers go into the unknown areas you enter at your own risk. As the only intrigue and unanswered questions here involve Lisbeth herself Dragon Tattoo is too neatly wrapped up too fastidious to get under your skin and stay there.

By David Denby Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in David Finchers new movie.   Credit Illustration by Luis Granena You cant take your eyes off Rooney Mara as the notorious Lisbeth Salander in the American movie version of Stieg Larssons ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (opening December 21st). Slender sheathed in black leather with short ebony hair standing up in a tuft her fingers poking out of black woollen gloves as they skitter across a laptop keyboard Mara (who played Mark Zuckerbergs girlfriend at the beginning of ""The Social Network"") cuts through scene after scene like a swift dark blade. Salander is a twenty-four-year-old hacker with many piercings of herself and of others. Shes both antisocial and intensely sexual--vulnerable and often abused but overequipped to take revenge. She lives in an aura of violence. Salander obviously accounts for a big part of the success of Larssons crime novels--both men and women are turned on by her--and Mara makes every scene that she appears in jump. She strips off and climbs right onto Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist the investigative journalist who takes Salander on as a partner and whom she makes her lover. Craig looks a little surprised. In this movie he is modest quiet even rather recessive. Its Maras shot at stardom and he lets her have it. Much of the movie is set on a private island controlled by the Vanger clan a wealthy Swedish industrial family peopled with criminals perverts solitaries exiles dead Nazis and a grieving old man Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) who has never got over the disappearance of his grandniece forty years earlier. In one last attempt to find her he hires Blomkvist who has been temporarily discredited in a libel suit and sets him up as an investigator on the island a place that no American one-per-cent family would ever dream of owning. Its way up north windy snowy and treacherously beautiful; once you cross the bridge to this enclave you enter an icy hell. Blomkvist and Salander warming each other conduct their investigation from the island hacking into whatever files they need; they leave only when they have to with Mara head down in the wind tearing around Sweden on a motorcycle like--well like a bat out of hell. The movie zips ahead in short spiky scenes punctuated by skillfully edited montages of digitized photographs and newspaper articles. David Fincher who directed the picture (working with Steven Zaillians screenplay) moves at a much faster pace than he did in ""Zodiac"" his 2007 movie about a murder investigation. In ""Zodiac"" every time a piece of evidence trembles into view it quickly recedes again. That movie is an expression of philosophical despair the truth can never be known. ""Dragon Tattoo"" says the opposite it celebrates deduction high-end detective work--what Edgar Allan Poe called ""ratiocination."" Everything can be known if you look long and hard enough especially if you have no scruples about hacking into peoples bank accounts e-mails and business records. Salander is a criminal but shes our criminal. At heart of course the material is pulpy and sensational. The Vanger men committed atrocious crimes against women in the past and Salander who is a ward of the state is twice brutalized by a smarmy social worker who controls her money. There are certainly lurid moments but I wouldnt say that Fincher exploits the material. When Salander is raped the scene registers as a horror; its prolonged and discomforting. And her revenge however justified and however much it may amuse the audience is another horror. This is a bleak but mesmerizing piece of filmmaking; it offers a glancing chilled view of a world in which brief moments of loyalty flicker between repeated acts of betrayal. In ""The Adventures of Tintin"" Steven Spielberg working with 3-D animation and motion-capture techniques produces the cohesion of a superbly made real-life movie (also opening December 21st). There are closeups overheads point-of-view sequences a moving camera within the frame and the shots--if thats what you call them--flow smoothly from one to the next. Visually the movie has ease and speed and lift and for about an hour its an exhilarating ride. The screenwriters Steven Moffat and the team of Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish pulled the story together from three of the classic Tintin books written by the Belgian comic-book artist Herge ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Red Rackhams Treasure."" The plot is standard boys-book adventure stuff. Tintin (Jamie Bell) the young reporter with an orange-brown quiff and insatiable curiosity pursues a buried treasure journeying to the far corners by ship plane and motorcycle. Hes accompanied by the bearded alcoholic sea captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and both of them are menaced by the vicious Sakharine (Daniel Craig again). The opera diva Bianca Castafiore a coiffed and generously bosomed regular feature of the books makes a guest appearance and warbles Rossini shattering every wineglass fish tank and chandelier in sight--which is special fun in 3-D. These characters have enough temperament to keep the story scurrying. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a virtual non-stop scramble of running jumping swinging dangling plunging and flying. All the characters have smooth skin that looks like brushed rubber; theyre halfway between puppets and humans in appearance. As they move they seem to float slightly as if like ballet dancers their momentum carried them past ordinary human ability. Yet they arent completely unfettered like the hand-drawn characters in an old cartoon or the digitally enhanced real-life figures in a schlock spectacle like ""Green Lantern."" Tintin doesnt possess supernatural powers the ground exists though he doesnt stay on it for long; the walls remain impenetrable. The play between fantasy and realism is what gives the film its special look. Spielberg and his collaborators (Peter Jackson was the producer) have come up with the equivalent of Herges clean-limbed lean-forward manner (the characters in Herges comic books seem always to be moving into the next panel). The animators labored for two years establishing settings--a street a ship a Moroccan city--and then the actors worked in a featureless room with reflectors attached to their bodies while dozens of digital cameras all around them picked up their movements. The animators used the movements--shrugs strains thrusts--to build the animated version of the characters and added the completed figures to the preset backgrounds. The technique is similar to the one that James Cameron used for ""Avatar"" but the look is drier plainer airier. Herge began the Tintin series in 1929 and the time period of his stories overlaps with that of Spielbergs design obsession the modern moment of the nineteen-thirties with its pontooned seaplanes and its long-hooded cars. In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Indiana Jones battled foes amid such svelte machines as a Mercedes Nazi staff car. Spielberg uses these mechanical stunners for his special brand of eccentric physical movement; in ""Raiders"" when the flying-wing airplane grounded and moored to the spot kept circling Indy fighting some lout ducked every time the whirling propellers swung around. In the new movie Tintin and Haddock crash-land in the desert and the propeller of their little seaplane keeps turning wreaking havoc before it finally dies. Spielberg prizes his echoes. Haddock and Sakharine have a rivalry that goes back three hundred years their ancestors crossed swords on the deck of a burning three-master. In the present they duel with the giant swivelling cranes at a ships loading dock. The great thing about ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is that it never stops moving--and the terrible thing about it is that it never stops moving. The filmmakers got so caught up in the look they wanted to achieve that they forgot something essential comic-book characters need fleshing out to fill a hundred-and-ten-minute movie. Who is Tintin? What does he want? Does he have a soul? And does Haddock ever think about anything besides his next drink? Hes a roaring cursing bore--so redundant and uninteresting that I longed for Sakharine to do him in. The characters temperaments are entirely physical. After about an hour I lost interest in the picture something that never happens with Pixars animated movies which have actual stories not just strung-together tumbles as well as social themes to chew over. ""Tintin"" is exhausting and for all its wonders it wears one out well before its over.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.
