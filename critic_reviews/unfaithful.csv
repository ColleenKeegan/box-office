This refitting of Claude Chabrols 1968 classic ""La Femme Infidele"" is less concerned with suspense and dramatic fireworks than is the usual American ""erotic thriller."" Adrian Lyne takes an uncharacteristically cool approach to adultery in ""Unfaithful"" a precision-tooled moody study in the wages of betrayal. This refitting of Claude Chabrols 1968 classic ""La Femme Infidele"" is less concerned with suspense and dramatic fireworks than is the usual American ""erotic thriller"" and much more devoted to nuances and the minutiae of how men and women behave pretend and lie in duplicitous situations. As such it may somewhat disappoint Lyne fans expecting another ""91/2 Weeks"" or ""Fatal Attraction"" even as it signals further maturity and refinement in the directors work post-""Lolita."" Given the subject matter and Richard Gere-Diane Lane star combo Fox should expect lively if not sizzling B.O. sparks to fly from the film its releasing six days before the next ""Star Wars"" pic. Just as he did with ""Lolita"" five years ago Lyne again dares to pit his own work against that of a highly regarded filmmaker albeit one not so familiar to the general public as Stanley Kubrick. All the same ""La Femme Infidele"" is a superb picture one of Chabrols two or three best and one Lyne acknowledges having been deeply impressed by upon its release. Although ""Unfaithful"" retains a Gallic connection in the casting of Olivier Martinez as the handsome young stranger who induces an upscale New York housewife to stray it has a very American character of its own one defined by sedate suburban homes kid-oriented social activities and becalmed emotional lives. Whereas Gere used to play the kind of tomcat who got women to do things against their better judgment here hes Edward Sumner the straight-arrow head of an armored truck company who rather unaccountably is able to live in a large and gorgeous 19th-century home on several acres in Westchester County near the Hudson River. His wife of 11 years Connie (Lane) is even more gorgeous and remains interested enough in her very fit husband to be the initiator of hanky-panky even if their intimate time is sorely limited by the habitual interruptions of their almost 9-year-old son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). From the opening shots of the title sequence Lyne suggests the imminent arrival of ill winds which shortly assume virtual gale force when Connie is running errands in Soho and literally bumps into Paul Martel (Martinez) a long-haired gentle-voiced Frenchman of equal parts insouciance and politesse who invites her up to his borrowed Mercer Street loft to tend to her scraped knee. Connie makes a quick exit to escape the disturbing undercurrents and even mentions the encounter to Edward but nevertheless visits Paul again the next time shes in the city. With considerably more difficulty she once again resists temptation. But the third times the charm or the curse as one would have it as Connie finally gives in to the persistent and excitingly rough Frenchman. Lyne presents this first encounter not with the flashy fetishism that marked his earlier erotica but very effectively as a blazing memory for the deeply affected Connie as shes riding back home on the train; she convulsively remembers moments impressionistically conveyed as she trembled and literally shook before Paul obliterated her barriers. In the thrall of her glorious and illicit affair which is conducted in Pauls dark book-and-sculpture-lined loft Connie naturally thinks she can get away with it that she can be smart and discreet and that nothing bad will come of it. Without her remotely suspecting it however cracks begin appearing in the protective cocoon of her amorous adventure A restaurant dalliance between the two lovers is noticed by one of Edwards employees; a sated Connie puts her husband off when he slips into the bath with her meaningfully saying ""Im cold"" and Paul provocatively showing up at a cafe when he knows Connie will be there with two women lures her into a quickie in the bathroom within a few feet of her friends. Edward receives proof of his wifes infidelity an hour into the film and second half is devoted to how he deals with Paul and how Edward and Connie deal with the formers dramatic actions. Moral considerations that supercede Connies extramarital wanderings come into play in much the same understated way as they did in the Chabrol original. For a film dedicated to the close observation of powerful urges and emotions ""Unfaithful"" has a relatively low pulse a symptom underlined by the muted color schemes long pauses in the dialogue exchanges and low-key turbulence of Jan A.P. Kaczmareks effective score. While beautifully lit and densely photographed by Peter Biziou pic is dominated by its dark combinations of blacks blues browns and greens as well as by the many moments of silence while characters wonder what others might be thinking or what they will do. Structurally screenplay by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. is deftly sculpted and as a director Lyne has progressed to the point where he knows how to emphasize whats important without overdoing it; time and again small visual details are economically utilized to reflect larger points and cheap sentimentality about emotional loss is sidestepped. Whats missing is any psychological depth to the principal characters especially the married couple. Nothing is revealed about their backgrounds romantic histories and tendencies remaining desires for their already well-appointed lives or the circumstances of their having hooked up in the first place. Although Connie doesnt seem the type who was always destined to be a housewife nothing is offered as to what she might have done before or whether she feels she gave up anything important for domesticitys sake. Even without any backgrounding however Lane serves up a compulsively watchable performance adroitly suggesting the void in Connies life that the character herself would never have admitted existed. Physically altogether different from the mousy Michel Bouquet in Chabrols film Gere is the picture of the genial and attentive husband and father. Character might have assumed a greater and more paradoxical level of complexity however had the actors own reputation been called into service to suggest that Edward might once have been exactly the kind of man with whom his wife now is philandering; how the ex-stud would have confronted the current edition might have added some unusual frissons to the man-to-man showdown. Martinez making his mainstream American debut after having been noticed in such pics as ""The Horseman on the Roof"" ""The Chambermaid on the Titanic"" and ""Before Night Falls"" is smoothly convincing as the unattached beautiful Frenchman having a high old time in Gotham. Brian Morris production design is richly detailed in its opposition of well-upholstered suburban life and downtown chic. Although they contain a sprinkling of nudity sex scenes are relatively restrained and dont begin to push hard R frontiers.

She plays Connie Sumner a wealthy happily married suburban mom who impulsively hurls herself into an affair with a hunky 28-year-old French book dealer (Olivier Martinez) in New Yorks SoHo. (Has anybody ever met a rare-book dealer who looks like this?) In a bravura erotic sequence Lyne shows us their first sexual encounter not as its happening but as Connie remembers it immediately afterward riding the train back to her husband (Richard Gere). Lost in a post coital reverie physically and emotionally disheveled Lane wordlessly shows us the emotional tumult raging inside Connie as lust fear excitement shame anguish and embarrassment flood her face in overlapping waves.Connie is hooked on romance like a junkie craving a fix. Shes unmoored from her life oblivious to her husbands suspicions and increasingly neglectful of her son (Erik Per Sullivan). The movie written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. is hypnotic as it charts her gradual immersion into obsession. You know of course that catastrophe lurks--this is after all the man who made ""Fatal Attraction.""Sure enough about 75 minutes into the tale Something Happens. I wont spoil any surprises but I wish the filmmakers had realized they didnt need these kinds of surprises. Lets just say ""Unfaithful"" takes a melodramatic turn and becomes a more generic plot-driven Hollywood movie. False notes intrude theres a crucial scene in which the husband goes to confront the young lover at his apartment and from the start Geres behavior is out of character. A man used to being in charge hed never put himself in that situation. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Lyne is a gifted and frustrating movie-maker. Is the punishing moralism and misogyny that surfaces in ""Fatal Attraction"" and the silly ""Indecent Proposal"" for real--or just his calculated notion of what the American moviegoer wants? He may have reason to be cynical when his most pandering films become huge hits and his more interesting honest movies--""Foxes"" ""Jacobs Ladder""--dont find an audience. When its a movie about desire ""Unfaithful"" shows what a powerful sexy smart filmmaker Lyne can be. Its a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense of what goes on between a man and a woman a husband and a wife.Unfaithful20th Century FoxOpens May 10Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Unlike the cheap shock tactics of its predecessor it proves a surprisingly grown up affair exploring the panoply of emotions unleashed by sex outside an 11-year marriage. Horny excitement burning shame selfish liberation and incipient fear all play across Lanes face in the most striking scene as she returns home musing on an illicit afternoon just spent with her young French lover (Martinez). What she doesnt quite count on is the response it provokes from her husband (Gere). Like Chabrols La Femme Infidele on which its based the film eventually slides into teasing thriller mode and though it lacks the originals astringent concentration the range of sympathies is definitely broader here as secrets on both sides lock the couple in a private hell. An old ad mans habits die hard however and too many scenes are pumped up for instant impact when slow burn might have brought greater reward. Still the superb acting and intelligent script negotiate an absorbing course between Hollywood glitz and Gallic soul-searching.

But since seriously and deeply freaking the audience is one sure-fire way to commercial perdition the box-office-savvy Lyne has become a master of the art of cinematic titillation. He has a gift for seduction and hes particularly cunning when it comes to the sort of hot-button movie topics adultery being a favorite trigger that seem to invariably make the leap from screen to newspaper commentary page. Hes expert at getting audiences where they live and sometimes stray and its a measure of how deeply he scrapes against the collective unconscious as well as testament to the integrity of his airbrushed style that while hes directed just eight features it feels as if he has a much larger body of work to his name. But if Lyne can be a brilliant tease hes also a punishing unforgiving one. He may enjoy making us feel good getting our juices and thoughts flowing but what he likes even better is making us feel really really bad. With Adrian Lyne no good time ever goes unpunished. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Before the fall though comes the fun -- the vaguely sordid slightly tacky stuff the human sense and insensibility that make Lyne as irresistible as he is embarrassing. In Unfaithful his third film about marital infidelity its also the stuff that works. The fun begins when married New York suburban mom Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) meets then takes a tumble with the younger Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) a French bookseller living in Soho. Along with her husband Edward (a fine Richard Gere) and 8-year-old son Connie lives in upper-middle-class affluence in one of those sheltered Hudson River towns co-opted by city professionals. Its all rather soft-focus lovely if about as full of life as a Martha Stewart Living get-together but because middle-class comfort is its own sort of hell at least at the movies this is also the sort of town where the daily walk from the commuter train has the feel of a death march. The women here dont have much to do besides their nails and Connie seems to have less to do than most. Theres some talk about a charity auction but other than servicing her lover and husband along with preparing her sons lunch Connie seems fairly useless -- no wonder Edward calls her ""Con.""Lyne isnt an especially personal filmmaker but there is a facile integrity to his vision. His films have the anonymous high-buffed gloss of costly professionalism but an inevitable vulgarity clings to their edges. It isnt simply the way the director films women though he never can resist pushing his camera down their blouses or under their skirts (from the evidence he is a big-breast and leg man). Its the way he tarts up his style. He has a weakness for shock cuts -- the kind that make us jump in our seats as if we were watching a horror movie instead of a movie limned with horror -- and a fondness for gauzy lighting. The irony is its his vulgarity this mixture of the gaudy and the glossy that distinguishes Lyne that makes his work identifiable and when the storys right such a guilty pleasure. The day that Connie falls from grace shes running errands in Soho when a wind kicks up thats so violent you half expect Margaret Hamilton to fly by on her bicycle. Tossed about like mesclun greens Connie stumbles over the cobblestones in her stilettos struggling to hold on to the shopping bags clutched in both hands. As the wind shrieks into metaphor (theres a storm a-coming) her skirt blows higher and higher until we get a peek-a-boo glimpse of panties along with those miles of leg.The whole thing is absurd wildly so -- the wind the high heels the forbidden Fruit of the Looms. It isnt just that the storm whips the story out of the register of the real but that Lynes insistence on underscoring tweaking and eventually clobbering the moment -- too many moments -- leeches the narrative of its power and unintentionally its high-mindedness. He cant seem to help himself. Every time Lyne appears on the verge of taking his stories seriously he veers into kitsch and the unbearable lightness of being Zalman King. Connie doesnt just fall from grace; the wind literally knocks her off her feet and on top of Paul landing them both in an art-directed heap. Of course hes beautiful of course hes French and of course hes got as many moves in his arsenal as Bobby Fischer. Her knees bloodied Connie accepts Pauls invitation to recover upstairs which is how in between accepting his bandages and eyeballing his bed sheets she ends up reading verse aloud amid the deshabille bohemianism of his loft. ""Be happy for the moment"" she says tenderly. ""This moment is your life."" Yes well at least until the husband or the wife finds out the lover goes bonkers and boils up a bunny bouillabaisse and it all goes straight to movie hell.

Sep. 13 600pm In Lynes world the body is more than a prison its a veritable penal colony through which men and women are condemned to reenact the Fall every time they have one too many drinks as in Fatal Attraction or get a bit too greedy as in Indecent Proposal. In Unfaithful Connies mostly bored and to judge by her sepulchral domesticity its no wonder. Lynes sympathies initially seem to be with Connie Lane is incredibly moving in the role and she wills the character to depths that remain unarticulated in Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr.s screenplay. The first time Connie sleeps with Paul Lanes body trembles with a violence thats shockingly almost embarrassingly naked. We see the lovers encounter not as it happens but somewhat after the fact as Connie sits on the train back home weeping and laughing to herself her body knotted with emotion as she remembers the sex. Its by far the best work with an actor that Lyne has ever done. Which makes it all the more frustrating when Lyne not only loses interest in Connie but trades in his evident sympathy with the lovers for the sort of moral posturing that always finds him selling out his favorite characters.Lyne is a shabby moralist. He not only sells his characters out he sells out his own point of view which is why while he sympathizes with Connie he cuts her loose. This isnt the first time hes done that but never before has a film gone as flat when he did. Whats curious about Unfaithful is just how little it pops; its as if Lyne had become so self-conscious about having based it on the work of a serious filmmaker on Claude Chabrols 1969 La Femme Infidele that he decided to tone down his go-for-the-jugular instincts for something more grown-up and staid. Throughout Unfaithful you can feel Lyne trying to be less Lyne-like which is the wrong tack since what gives his films oomph is crude sensations not ideas. Like Chabrol Lyne has an interest in the emotional geography of infidelity but unlike the French director he isnt a sophisticated thinker and he cant help but pass judgment on his characters especially the women. The wife in Chabrols film is a mystery and as expressionless as a corpse because her motivations are irrelevant to how the betrayal affects her husband. In both films the husbands actions are terrible and finally in a perverse way both rational and moral. Yet only in the Chabrol does the wife maintain her innocence however eccentric (and French). In Unfaithful the wife falls and stays fallen. Lynes women are consistently more vibrant than his men yet if he loves women in his own way and I think he does theres a part of him that always wants to punish and humiliate them as well. If he liked women as much as he loved them then it might be easier to take Lyne as seriously as he seems to take himself. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Unfaithful | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unfaithful ) Unfaithful (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Adrian Lyne must have a fascination for examining the ins and outs of marital infidelity. Unfaithful Lynes first outing since the controversial Lolita follows in the distant wake of Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal. In some ways Unfaithful (based on Calude Chabrols superior La Femme Infidele which was a re-telling of ""Madame Bovary"") is the least complicated of the three but the moral is the same extra-marital sex regardless of the underlying reasons is a bad idea. As one character in this movie suggests it may all start as fun and games but once it moves past a one-night stand it will inevitably end badly for one or both parties. The first two-thirds of Unfaithful are an interesting if at times overwrought look at how a seemingly happily-married woman can fall into an affair and how she copes with leading a double life. She loves her son and husband but craves the other man. For a while the clandestine nature of this relationship is blissful but there comes a time when complications begin to surface - she becomes careless forgets to pick up her son after school and tells lies that are easily disproved. Her husband becomes suspicious. Thats when Unfaithful takes an unfortunate turn down a blind alley that leads to lurid melodrama. The movie begins in Westchester County New York (a suburb of the city) where Edward and Connie Sumner (Richard Gere and Diane Lane) are living a storybook existence. They have a comfortable marriage a nine-year old son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan) and enough money to assure that their material needs are met. Then comes one windy day in Manhattans Soho when Connie loses her balance and is rescued by gallant Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) an impossibly good-looking book dealer whose smoldering glance catches Connies attention. She returns the next day ostensibly to thank him then the day after that with no excuse except that she finds him fascinating. Soon they are engaged in what can only be described as sexual acrobatics (I defy anyone to attempt half the positions these two try). And when Edward catches Connie in a seemingly innocent lie he begins to wonder - which leads him to hire a private investigator. No part of Unfaithful is likely to be mistaken for great art but as a non-demanding look at the pros and cons of adultery this film does a decent job. One of the intriguing aspects is that Lyne doesnt fall back on the number one reason for on-screen faithlessness the bad marriage. Edward and Connie are happy together and clearly love one another. Connies dalliance has more to do with the urge to explode outside of the confines of a carefully ordered life than because of a fundamental dissatisfaction with her husband. Indeed it doesnt take long before the initial exuberance of the affair erodes into something far less heady. Connie is not in love with Paul; shes in lust with him. Their early encounters may possess a semi-romantic aura but that has dissipated by the time they stumble into a public lavatory and go at it in a stall. As is almost obligatory for a Lyne film theres plenty of hot sex. Unfaithful is actually pretty tame when it comes to nudity (there are a few shots of Diane Lanes breasts and one of her buns) but theres quite a bit of simulated sexual activity some of which requires the stamina and strength of a professional athlete. Unfaithful is surprisingly well acted with Lane easily commanding the cameras attention. Over the years she has developed into a capable actress with impressive range. With the possible exception of A Walk on the Moon (the other movie in which she played a cheating housewife) Lane has never been better. She is particularly effective in the scene when she finally succumbs to Pauls seduction; the combination of arousal and nervousness is powerful. Richard Gere relegated to the role of the cuckolded husband with an expanding waistline has found a part that agrees with him. His performance is less stiff and unyielding than is typical. French actor Olivier Martinez is borderline awful but hes in the movie more for his looks than for his thespian capabilities. I would almost be willing to recommend Unfaithful as a guilty pleasure if not for the final forty minutes. I hate it when screenplays take the easy way out and thats what happens here. After the plots big turning point the movie loses its focus and cant decide whether it wants to be a melodrama or a crime thriller. The ending is ambiguous in all the wrong ways and comes across as a cheat more than anything else. (I had a feeling based on the way the closing scene was edited that something was coming that didnt happen - it may have ended up on the cutting room floor.)

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Olivier Martinez as Paul and Diane Lane as Connie in UNFAITHFUL. (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Depths of passion / Unfaithful delivers marital melodrama with strong acting unexpected truths 1 / 2 Back to Gallery UNFAITHFUL Drama. Starring Diane Lane Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez. Directed by Adrian Lyne. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Unfaithful"" represents the best of both worlds. It excites the emotions in the way a good melodrama should but it also stirs the quieter feelings of pity and helplessness we associate with tragedy. Its that rare kind of movie that comes along only a handful of times each year -- gut-level entertainment thats oddly profound. Director Adrian Lyne (""Fatal Attraction"") has always been a stylish filmmaker but he gives ""Unfaithful"" much more than surface elegance. His choice of angles and colors his use of shadows and especially his mastery of editing all work to create a unified psychological texture. Hes aided by an unusually honest and perceptive script by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. and by Diane Lane and Richard Gere whose performances go to a place of complete emotional nakedness. In American movies women almost never enter into sexual affairs for purely carnal reasons at least not without being evil or crazy. ""Unfaithful"" breaks that mold. Lane plays Connie a nice suburban wife and mother who by chance meets a handsome young man in SoHo and gets infected by the lust bug. The young man played by Olivier Martinez is almost a parody of the husbands worst nightmare. Hes young (28) and French. He lives in a loft surrounded by books and he has all the confidence that comes with being ridiculously handsome and having a French accent in America. To Connie suddenly reawakened to passion in the twilight of her young womanhood passing up an affair with this fellow would be like agreeing to get buried 40 years too early. ""Unfaithful"" doesnt stack the deck by making the husband a loser. Richard Gere plays him as a regular guy who probably used to be sexy and now is Dad. He has a successful though unromantic business (armored security) and makes a good enough living to have a dream house in White Plains N.Y. Yet even the suburbs -- or especially the suburbs -- cant suppress the ghastly writhings of free will. Theres a remarkable sequence on a train in which Connie rides home after her first afternoon in bed with the young lover. Her emotional state is one anybody could recognize though its hard to put a name to it -- suppressed exultation? Pained hysteria? Lyne cuts from the train to shots from the days big event a sex scene thats charged erotic and terrible with the sense that this lady is tossing everything overboard. Shes trembling and we can feel it. Not every filmmaker can convey that physical sense. Lyne doesnt just show passion but somehow takes us inside it so that we understand what it would be like to be her to inhabit a body electric with nonstop longing. Its not an enviable state. Its more like a fever. When she lowers herself into the bath at the end of the day we know theres no relief. Yet ""Unfaithful"" doesnt get moralistic by presenting the affair as something miserable. If she were miserable she wouldnt be doing it. Instead Lane plays Connie as buoyant and energized and so happy shed almost like to get caught just so she can brag about it. If the movie allows Lane to give her best performance to date it also provides Gere with a chance to prove he can do more than play a middle-aged smoothie. He has one scene in particular thats make or break not just for the role but for the movie in which the husband goes to the young mans apartment. Gere plays it expertly. If it were on video it would be something to play over and over again for the ways in which Gere never gets ahead of himself but rather operates from moment to moment. This is seriously good screen acting. ""Unfaithful"" says some true things about marriage true enough that men will be looking askance at their wives for days after seeing it. Along the way it achieves a distinct mood capturing suburban malaise in an overhead shot of men exiting the commuter train at the end of the day -- and combining that mood with a sense of dangerous currents beneath the surface. Here when a man and a woman talk while stopped at a red light the reflection on the windshield looks like smeared blood. This is John Cheever meets film noir a thoughtful crowd-pleaser.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

""Unfaithful"" yet another soon-to-be-forgotten Richard Gere vehicle is an overheated melodrama about a woman who strays from her monotonous husband only to force him into a nasty situation that cries out for multiple bouts of eye-blinking. Surprisingly Gere dwells in the background for much of the picture while Diane Lane as his sexually supercharged wife repeatedly takes off her blouse and strips down to her panties. Lanes near-obsessive aversion to clothing while beneath her significant abilities as an actress is the only commendable move in the entire film. Gere is cast as a hard-working New York suburbanite named Edward Sumner although its a stretch to say he actually ""portrays"" him. Edward and his beautiful wife Connie (Lane) seemingly have it all a spacious house lots of money a cute little son (Erik Per Sullivan) and a cute little dog (just some dog). Unfortunately their comfortable existence is starting to wear on Connie. Getting her son off to school in the morning seems to be her most pressing duty and Edward is dull as a bag of peat moss; even his sweaters are bland. Things pick up considerably however when Connie literally bumps into someone on a windy Soho street.

"USATODAY.com - Unfaithful turns torrid affair scary Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/11/2002 - Updated 0705 AM ET Unfaithful turns torrid affair scary By Mike Clark USA TODAY Photo credit Diane Lane and Richard Gere play a married couple in Unfaithful. Richard Gere may be entering his ""emeritus"" period with Adrian Lynes Unfaithful ( out of four) a cautionary tale about suburban adultery in which the actor is uncommonly cast as the romantic third wheel.As his wife Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979s A Little Romance (when she was 14). Shes a participant in several hot sex scenes (a couple practically in public) but one comes out of the theater talking about her acting once fate and guilt douse the lights on her characters afterglow.With its frequent silent pauses and an effectively ambiguous wrap-up rare in todays Hollywood the movie feels vaguely European. In part this is because its inspired by Claude Chabrols 1969 La Femme Infidele one of the best films made by the oft-cited ""French Hitchcock."" Like its predecessor Unfaithful is really two movies One about the affair (Hudson River wife sneaks off to New Yorks SoHo) and the other about what happens when the husband finds out. Unfaithful (out of four)Stars Richard Gere Diane Lane Olivier Martinez Rating Rated R for sexuality language and a scene of violenceOlivier Martinez punches up Unfaithful role The seasoned hunk who tempts Lane is a French used-books dealer (Olivier Martinez) who lives in a friends worn but spacious apartment. The two meet on the street during a sensually photographed windstorm in which Lane loses control of her dress and even takes a tumble onto the sidewalk. The turbulence portends whats put in motion after she elects to go upstairs for a bandage then finds herself returning to the building again and again until she finally crosses the line.Even if you didnt know Lyne directed Fatal Attraction you would sit through this always-solemn movie fearing the outcome. Unfaithful doesnt push the melodrama the way Attraction did but it lingers in the mind as much. Ten years ago Lyne might have junked this movie up he way he did 9 1/2 Weeks and Indecent Proposal but he has become a more subtle director since even 1997s Lolita.The characters here arent particularly fleshed out but Lyne leaves room for viewers to fill in some blanks. Geres character for instance is shown to be testy at work so maybe hes a tough case at home too. Though we never specifically see this the household is filled with tension from the first scene.In what seems odd at first Geres hair is less gray here than in some movies in which he played the stud. But it later makes sense because in a startling plot twist the character must become a take-charge guy and convince us hes more physically fit than many middle-agers are. Lane clearly is in shape too but the characters most enduring quality is weariness. Her plight recalls the old cigarette commercial that once asked America ""Are you smoking more now but enjoying it less?""

Its a movie in which an ordinary woman from the New York suburbs played with startling conviction by Diane Lane begins to sneak away from her beautiful white dream home in the Hudson Valley deceiving the family she loves in order to indulge in a cathartic sexual fling with a weaselly French hunk whos built like a Michelangelo. Her husband learns of the affair and when he discovers how far its gone his reaction comes as as big a shock to him as it does to us. ""Unfaithful"" is the sort of movie that is generally described as ""steamy"" which is shorthand for Love Scenes Shot in Cliche Erotic Style of Spice Channel. Lyne has made his share of glorified megaplex porn (""Indecent Proposal"" ""9 1/2 Weeks"") but hes also the director who in ""Fatal Attraction"" struck a raw nerve of infidelity and possession in the age of postfeminist sexual warfare. Far from your typical hazy-filter voyeur he has an uncanny sensitivity to the hidden jagged byways of feminine desire and he has staged ""Unfaithful"" with a slow forbidden-game meditative savvy that allows the audience to linger over each dread-ridden secret and lie. A loose remake of the 1969 Claude Chabrol film ""La Femme Infidele"" this is hardly a movie thats going to be confused with art but not since the underrated ""What Lies Beneath"" has a domestic thriller been made with so much sultry juice and power. ""Unfaithful"" takes off from an observation that in its simple way is quite daring It says that the deep rich comforts of family life arent always enough to keep even a contented person from straying. Connie Sumner (Lane) loves her doting slightly fuddy-duddy security contractor husband Edward (Richard Gere) as well as the life they share with their perky 8-year-old son. So why does she let herself be seduced by Paul (Olivier Martinez) the insinuating Gallic book dealer who rescues her from a SoHo windstorm? Is it because hes the sort of philosophe stud who drops pensees like ""Theres no such thing as a mistake - theres what you do and what you dont do""? The film refuses to offer the usual excuses (e.g. cold-fish husband) and that makes the real reason all the more compelling. Connie slides into a fling because shes a sensual woman whose contentment is tinged with complacency and because the opportunity presents itself in a way thats too sexy to resist. Once she gives in to Pauls charms though she gets addicted to them. The further he pushes her (a bit of Samp;M; a shag in a bistro bathroom) the further she wants to go. Lyne shoots the sex scenes like slivers of delirium that flirt with but never slide into fantasy and Lane in the most urgent performance of her career is a revelation. The play of lust romance degradation and guilt on her face is the movies real story. Her work in the films intriguing second half however wouldnt be possible without Geres own understated duplicity. As these two circle each other their marriage held together by the very cycle of forbidden acts thats also tearing it apart ""Unfaithful"" like a more languid ""Fatal Attraction"" becomes a thriller myth of the perils of adultery which few filmmakers can heighten like Lyne.
