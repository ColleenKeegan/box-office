"Pumping Irony << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Monta Ellis Is Probably Shooting Right Now  Next Lets Go Boston Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities Pumping Irony Michael Bay attempts to go Coen brothers with Pain amp; Gain by Wesley Morris on April 25 2013 At 41 Mark Wahlberg might have discovered a sense of humor too late to laugh at himself. Yet here he is in Pain amp; Gain doing hanging crunches on the side of a building hacking up a corpse wearing only a pair of Calvin Klein boxer briefs and playing a conniving fool who understands that his body is a passport to riches. Fifteen years ago this movie might have made him a star. Now that he is a star -- one who created an HBO series about that stardom -- mocking himself and the shirtlessness that made fame possible requires a director who wants to say more than ""Mark Wahlberg used to be Marky Mark"" a director who can set an entire film in the world of personal training and physical fitness and do only a light workout a director who doesnt simply get comedy but knows how to execute the setups that result in jokes. You need the Coen brothers or Alexander Payne for that filmmakers who know that touchless control is the key to a certain kind of farce. Instead the farce is courtesy of Michael Bay who never met an idea he couldnt blow to smithereens. Pain amp; Gain weighs about 700 pounds when it ought to weigh 2. The heaviness seems appropriate only in the most literal sense. The movie announces that its based on a true story and when the word ""unfortunately"" appears on the screen you know this is going to be the sort of comedy that keeps poking you in the chest with gags. It almost doesnt even matter that the ""unfortunately"" is funny because it gradually feels like a preemptive critique. The true story involves a Miami personal trainer named Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) who wants a lot for himself but doesnt know how to get it. He winds up with a job at a fitness resort run by a sleazebag (Rob Corddry). Danny drives up the membership with perks like free workouts for strippers. These speedily edited scenes of Danny wandering around the floor supporting some clients and rolling his eyes at others have a nice easiness and you want to see what Bay does once Danny decides to kidnap torture and extort a fortune from Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) the uncouth businessman he trains. Danny lets two other gym rats in on his scheme Adrian an inveterate juicer played by Anthony Mackie and Paul an enormous born-again ex-con junkie played by Dwayne Johnson. Getting Kershaw looks like a simple in-and-out job but their timing is always off. One night theyre all set to break in but Kershaw and his wife have people over for Shabbat so they have to turn around and try again later. They eventually capture him and things start looking up for them down for Kershaw and then way way down for his captors. The movies script is by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and is based on a three-part series of articles Pete Collins wrote for the Miami New Times in 1999. The primary problem with what theyve done is that too many characters narrate what were seeing. This is the sort of movie thats got a lot of talking and almost none of its necessarily comedic. If were being honest Bay does know whats funny. Its just never his plots or highly orchestrated action sequences Its the casts which he doesnt appear to control. Thats why in Bad Boys II he let Martin Lawrence run amok and in the Transformers series actors like Frances McDormand John Turturro Julie White and Ken Jeong basically urinated on the material. That second Bad Boys is the best thing Lawrence has done in a movie and Bay found a way to let him do it during the action sequences. They were making him lose his mind. Jeong has a role here as a dubious motivational speaker who motivates Danny and Rebel Wilson plays a nurse who helps Adrian with his steroid-induced impotence then falls in love with him. Both comedians hold fast to their respective shticks the way Bay lets such people do. Ed Harris makes a late arrival as the retired detective who helps Kershaw attempt to retrieve some of his fortune from the films three stooges and perhaps is there to show how hard Shalhoub is working at Semitic megalomaniacal misery. Harris breezily uncharacteristically heads in the opposite direction under-the-top. His scenes usually involve the wonderful Emily Rutherfurd who plays his younger sunnier wife. Actors this relaxed make you even less interested in all the murk and grisliness in the movies second hour. But Bay also has Mackie and Johnson to lighten the load. Mackie spends most of the movie burying his intelligence beneath willful naivete. He gives you the impression that Adrian was smart before he got to Miami. But Johnson is the best thing here. He has the only part with anything to it. Hes been looking for a role that lets him be funny and messy and damaged. Paul is a drug-addicted giant whos fighting to stay on the wagon a Jesus freak who isnt sure how freaked to be a giant with the mind and skateboard of a 13-year-old boy. Johnsons the one actor who finds somewhere psychological to take his performance and the sight and sound of him bleary and stammering and high and confused achieves both physical and emotional comedy. Its shocking how at ease he is as this human mess within Bays larger commercial one. Pain amp; Gain becomes a stew of tonal incongruities -- its based on a tragedy thats played for laughs; the people who die so comically here actually died quite horrifically. The movie descends into appalling grandiosity -- Goodfellas by way of Tony Scott. The Coen brothers similarly can be seen crossing the line from satire into sadism. There are loose similarities between this movie and their hateful little farce Burn After Reading but the ludicrousness there is at least truly ludicrous. This movie never sustains any ludicrousness. Its as if the screenwriters tried to write something along the lines of a Carl Hiaasen Florida crime comedy and lost their way. Pain amp; Gain needs something more ecstatic -- and by the second hour Wahlberg is really giving us everything he has. But hes not that kind of star. Hes not a worker like Tom Cruise. His thugginess rarely has the capacity for neurosis or cogent desperation. He just tires himself out. Every time the tension begins to mount here someone starts talking offscreen about the plot. Bay spends the entire movie mistaking extreme slow-motion for comedy -- its like hes dunking the images in glue. He never gets to apply his keen sense of visual proportion and spatial relations of how to upend the facts of geography and laws of physics with spectacular destruction. The movie wants to be lighter but it simply cant lose the weight. The image of Johnson carrying that skateboard tells you everything you need to know. Hes really too big to ever attempt to ride it which would be funny. Instead it just stands in for an actual joke. Bay seems attracted to the movie because Dannys inflated idea of whats American has something to do with Bays epic sense of nationalism. The character says that its unpatriotic not to use everything you have to get what you want. That is essentially how Marky Mark became Mark Wahlberg. When Danny proclaims in a voice-over that America is the buffest country on earth were meant to feel the mocking irony. But its distressing that the movie doesnt have any moral alternative of its own. It loves Dannys delusions and psychopathic pride. So all you feel from Bay is the ""Amen.""

But thats not always a bad thing as Bay proves with his wildly entertaining Pain amp; Gain. Based very loosely on a true story the film follows a trio of lunkheaded Miami muscle men - ambitious grasper Mark Wahlberg impotent dimwit Anthony Mackie and loveable ex-con turned repentant believer Dwayne Johnson - as they attempt to get rich quick by kidnapping a deli owner (Stanley Tucci) and rinsing him for his every dime. The first hour may be Bays career high point its fast freaky gloriously tasteless and startlingly pointed in its attacks on western insecurity shallowness and greed (I just wanted my part of the American dream enthuses Wahlbergs pea-brained psychopath). There are tonal wobbles later on - a descent into extreme violence coupled with Bays customary sexism does get tiresome. But the ever-present air of madcap goofball insanity carries it through. A seriously guilty pleasure.

But what kind of stuff do you use as the construction material for that story? Please why does it ALL have to be so dumb? I suppose you can mock every typical Hollywood trick used in films as they are often ridiculous and we are well aware of it but why have so much of that and make everything look so stupid? I would have liked it if it was at least a bit more serious.

Average film - personally not one for the DVD collectionFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 5 2013critiqueFeaturedCE - that`s not the first bizarre misinformation Tom Huddleston has incorporated in to his Time Out film reviews. As it goes Shalhoub is the best thing in this pumped-up unpleasant crime romp. The tone is very uneven and the characterisation is weak. Johnson was okay in Snitch and Wahlberg as good as I`ve seen him in 2 Guns but here I was all too aware I was viewing ""The Rock"" and Marky Mark rather than two proper actors. Bay directs with dynamism and a lively visual eye but it isn`t enough to save an over-long mis-firing script.

A studio rep informed me that the filmmaker ""did not opt for a Rolling Stone review."" Ha. Like thats his decision. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> So heading to my local multiplex I laid down 12 bucks for a ticket. For a second I worried that Bay might have sent Optimus Prime to the box office on orders to crush me but thats too Hollywood even for Bay. Confession I harbored a mad hope that Pain and Gain made for a scant 26 million (the snack budget on his Transformers films) might actually show a different side to this filmmaker. He once claimed he wanted to make a small personal film that would reveal the real Bay. And Im here to report that Pain and Gain is that film. Its dumb shallow deeply cynical and and creatively bereft. Pain and Gain is a true story sort of. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is based from a series of Pete Collins articles originally published in the Miami New Times about the Sun Gym gang. In the mid-1990s these dim-bulb Florida bodybuilders led by gym manager Danny Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) came up with something rare for them (and Bay) - an idea. Kidnap and extort a rich client Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). To help Danny brings in two besties personal trainer Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and ex-con Paul (Dwayne Johnson) an alcoholic recovering with the help of Jesus. Its a promising story that deserved more than a Bay botch job. Good actors are trapped in Bays toxic bubble forced to make farce out of a scary real-life situation. In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh. Pain and Gain is personal all right. You leave these characters with the distinct impression that theyre Bays kind of people. But I did learn something from Pain and Gain. The next time Bay bars me from screening Ill realize hes really doing me a favor. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Apart from Pearl Harbor and the synapse-frying second Transformers picture hes not that bad. Sometimes hes even really good -- his work is smashing in all senses. Now he hits new levels of both artistry and sleaziness in the black comedy Pain amp; Gain which I strongly recommend if you dont overvalue taste subtlety and moral decency. I liked it. Actually the movie is not entirely unsubtle. Its star Mark Wahlberg is a comedian of surprising refinement. His secret is that he plays everything straight finding a razors edge between bovine thickness and predatory cunning. As Florida personal trainer Daniel Lugo his hair stands up in sweet ragamuffin spikes; he looks so dopey and innocent that you cant believe hed hatch a scheme to kidnap and seize all of the assets of a gym client a half-Jewish half-Colombian whole-asshole named Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). Ah but Lugo is a man who believes that not to ""go for it"" is positively unpatriotic. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (based on magazine articles by Pete Collins based on -- the titles inform us not once but twice -- a true story) lays out the sociological parameters from the start. Lugo explains in voice-over that we are all born equal (physically and mentally) and can with sufficient singlemindedness and effort become in effect supermen and live in luxury. It emerges that to attain this American dream he will have to steal from Americans with similar dreams but he does not -- in the best Cato Institute tradition -- let that slow him down. Let others feel the pain. Dwayne Johnson plays Lugos partner in crime Paul Doyle an ex-con ex-cokehead and eternal meathead who has found Christ but also has had to cold-cock the priest who awakened and then put the moves on him. Johnson is broader than Wahlberg in both style and physique his neck being wider than my shoulders. But theres something very likable about him. Anthony Mackie is the third and even dimmer partner whose penis were informed has shrunk on account of steroid use. The actor -- here channeling Eddie Murphy -- has not yet fulfilled the promise of Half Nelson and The Hurt Locker but I imagine its hard to turn down a Michael Bay paycheck. Its the American Dream. This is Bay as weve not seen before attempting a tour de force of style -- montage plus narration in the tradition of Scorseses Goodfellas and such Danny Boyle hot-dog pictures as Trainspotting and the recent Trance. The Bay touch is the many shots from behind the long thighs and small butts of women in the gym and elsewhere although he adds some Rebel Wilson cheesecake (shes a nurse who likes black guys) to prove that big small he loves em all or at least loves exploiting them for laughs. Ken Jeong plays a seminar-leading financial evangelist who ridicules ""maybe"" guys and counsels those who drink in his wisdom (including Wahlbergs Lugo) to get off their ""lazy American"" asses. It follows that none of the actors gives ""maybe"" lazy-ass performances. Shalhoubs half-Colombian half-Jew will be offensive to both Colombians and Jews (you actually see him in a yarmulke leading a Shabbos meal) but not so offensive that hes not a howl. I love the guy. Pain amp; Gain gives you a rush while at the same time making you queasy about how youre getting off. Partly youre supposed to be queasy because of the idiotic amorality of the characters -- thats what passes for dramatic complexity. Partly youre queasy because Bay and company are active participants if not co-conspirators. Here the director values -- and gets high on -- shock. As the film goes from straight-ahead satire to a mixture of Three Stooges slapstick and bloody violence you cant quite believe what youre seeing and know on some level its wrong to feel pleasure. But thats true of many movies isnt it? Discomfort is the price we sensitive souls pay. And you know no pain no gain.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDRed Carpet Report Pain amp; Gain premiereReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRed Carpet Report Pain amp; Gain premiere 0116Story highlights""Pain amp; Gain"" directed by Michael Bay is based on a true crime storyThe film stars Mark Wahlberg Anthony Mackie and Dwayne JohnsonThe directors callous disregard for human suffering is plain to seeWhat was it Jane Fonda used to say? ""No pain no gain."" She wasnt talking about punching a guy in the face handcuffing him to a chair for days and weeks on end stringing him upside down like a piece of dry-cleaning setting him on fire (feel the burn) and running him over with a van but these nuances can get lost in translation when an ambitious young man takes it into his head to improve his lot in life. Such is the plot of ""Pain amp; Gain."" Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is like Don Vito Corleone he believes in America. His heroes are the self-made men -- like the Corleones like Scarface. The guys who started with nothing and made it happen for themselves. Do-ers not dont-ers. Daniel believes in America and he believes in fitness and having proved his worth by attaining the physique he always wanted and tripling the membership at the Miami gym where he works (primarily by offering free memberships to strippers) he reckons he deserves the rest of the package the big house the boat the sports car the money. And so he hatches a ""three-finger plan."" With two bodybuilding buddies (Anthony Mackie and Dwayne Johnson) he snatches a wealthy client (Tony Shalhoub) and tortures him until he signs away all his property and assets. Surprisingly this works. The gangs gross incompetence and double-digit IQ is matched only by the indifference of local law enforcement. Although hes famous for his boys toys movies (""Transformers"" ""Armageddon"") lets not forget Michael Bay cut his teeth on the slick buddy cop movie ""Bad Boys"" which filmed in and around Miami at much the same time as Daniel Lugo and pals were chopping up body parts with a chainsaw and an ax. Does that make this self-styled ""small movie"" a more personal mature work than his blockbusters? Well its R-rated which means Bay gets to indulge his sexism and casual homophobia more explicitly than usual albeit roped to a scattershot satire of dumbbell self-improvement culture and rampant egomania. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have shown a knack for hardboiled black comedy before notably in ""You Kill Me"" and its easy to imagine that the Coen brothers could have fashioned something sharp and funny out of this dismal true story. But even if hes obviously imitating ""Burn After Reading"" (the Coens worst film) and ""Fargo"" (possibly their best) putting a satire in Bays hands is rather like presenting the keys of a stolen Lamborghini to a drunken teenager. Its a fast ride but it doesnt take you where you want to go. This is a movie about stupidity and cruelty in which stupidity and cruelty permeate almost every scene. Bay doesnt hold anything back -- everything is over-pitched and underlined in hot neon. If hes braked his trademark action cutting its only to go overboard on slow-motion so as not to miss a single drop of blood or perspiration.He casts broad comic actors like Rebel Wilson Rob Corddry Michael Rispoli and Ken Jeong in supporting roles while encouraging his leads to play it straight but caricatures victims and criminals alike. Theyre all contemptible in his eyes -- the women more than anyone. Israeli model Bar Paly plays an Eastern European stripper who is apparently so stupid she believes Daniel is a CIA agent. Shes also subjected to a throwaway gang rape gag for her trouble -- thanks for that Michael. The scenes of violence -- played for gross-out black comedy -- are especially toxic. This crude and ugly entertainment is as crass as everything this depressingly successful filmmaker has done.

Fred Prouser/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Its official. Michael Bay director of the ""Transformers"" clobberfests knows how to make movies about humans too. The problem is he thinks humans are robots.""Pain amp; Gain"" is about a trio of knuckleheaded Miami bodybuilders who kidnap a loudmouthed millionaire and take him for everything hes got but its resemblance to the ""Transformers"" movies is patently obvious. Nobody in it seems to possess a nervous system.The three beefcakes are played by Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson (he doesnt go by The Rock anymore - pity) and Anthony Mackie. Tony Shalhoub is the nattery Colombian-Jewish kidnapee who Rasputin-like refuses to die despite the knuckleheads every effort to put him asunder. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time All this is apparently based on a true story. Just in case we thought things were getting too outlandish Bay at one point helpfully flashes on the screen ""This is still a true story."" The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Maybe so but nothing in this movie seems remotely real. Given how much ultra-gory Tarantino-esque mayhem is on view maybe thats a good thing. Whereas Tarantino mucks about in real-world stuff like slavery and the Holocaust Bay at least keeps his gruesomeness firmly planted in never-never land.Thats not a recommendation just an observation.Next up for Bay ""Transformers 4.""

Somebody took all his giant toys away. And thank heavens too. Because without his ""Transformers"" to play with the genius-stupid filmmaker has actually turned out a pretty good movie with some wild style and surprising turns. ""Pain amp; Gain"" is still a Michael Bay movie of course -- which means fiery explosions slow motion blaring music and an endless parade of young women in thongs. Restraint? In Bays movies thats something the cops put you in when you start mouthing off. But even with all that the picture still manages to be a strange contradiction -- a polished piece of crude entertainment. The story -- based on fact -- is a slice of the kind of true-crime sleaze that only Florida can deliver. But basically it involves a crew of criminal body builders a couple of shady businessmen extortion torture Eastern European strippers and a private eye. You know just another weekend in South Beach. Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson are the chief beefcakes here and theyre the obvious box-office draws -- and sadly the weakest parts of the picture. Neither is a stupid man -- you dont get to be as rich as they are with as small a skill set as they have out of stupidity. But they dont play stupid well. Wahlberg just pops his eyes. Johnson grins sweetly. Theyre hard workers but theyre not deft enough to get at the best jokes -- that Wahlbergs character is an idiot who thinks hes smart and Johnson a psychopath who thinks hes a saint. Pumping iron is one thing but pushing irony is beyond them. But there are some far better actors here in the supporting cast including Anthony Mackie Ed Harris Tony Shalhoub and as Mackies large-and-in-charge wife Rebel Wilson. Each one shines. And Bay understands that this crime movie is really about American ambition -- its no mistake that one character quotes the De Palma ""Scarface"" or a few scenes recall a goofball ""Goodfellas."" In a rare subtle touch the soundtrack even channels the Tangerine Dream score for ""Risky Business"" -- another crime-as-capitalism picture that trafficked in aspirational larceny. Its so subtle it may even be unconscious -- Bay pounds points home like twopenny nails. Most of the movie is shot from absurdly low angles (as if you needed them to make The Rock loom large.) Tiny dashboard cameras and oversaturated colors also come into play. But for once Bay steps back a little bit from the Cuisinart editing and slambang chases to give some space to other effects. Like a few sly performances. And an appreciation of the sunbaked sideshow tilt-a-whirl that Miami can be (a world Bay clearly knows even if he hasnt visited it onscreen since the ""Bad Boys"" movies). ""Pain amp; Gain"" is definitely sleazy (private eye Ed Harris and his 30-years-too-young wife are the only moral characters in the whole film). Even a little queasy (violent as Wahlberg and his gang are they still get more sympathy from the filmmaker than their victims). But it may be the best movie Michael Bays ever made. And suggests that if you just kept his toys put away a little longer someday he might even make a better one. Ratings note The film contains violence gore drug and alcohol abuse strong language nudity and sexual situations. Pain amp; Gain (R) Paramount (130 min.) Directed by Michael Bay.

""Unfortunately"" we are informed at the beginning of Pain amp; Gain ""this is a true story."" The truth -- usually avoided by crime thrillers but underlined with a crimson flourish in Michael Bays steroidal caper comedy -- is that most criminals are stupid. If they were smart theyd find a more respectable way to steal peoples money like Bitcoin or Congressional lobbying. Instead in this adaptation of Pete Collins stranger-than-fiction report for the Miami New Times on the 1994-95 Sun Gym case two people die and two oafs wind up on Death Row. Film critics would argue that Bay has a rap sheet too. Among the charges felonious bombast cruel and unusual mismatched shots wanton desertion of cinematic humanity embrace of a military-industrial style of filmmaking contempt for his movies characters and their audiences -- all adding up to grand-theft auteurism. That Bay is at the top of one connoisseurs list of the 26 worst directors of all time (Ed Wood is No. 2) seems not to trouble him. ""I make movies for teenage boys"" he has said. ""Oh dear what a crime."" Actually thats no crime. Modern Hollywood has sired plenty of excellent action movies for young males; one of these Iron Man Three opens next week. Bays offense is that he has made by any definition of cinematic artistry and technique bad movies. They tap the laziest part of the audiences brain fill it with ugly clamor and leave it feeling not nourished but stuffed. Its cheap sex for filmgoers consumption and his profit. (READ Corliss on Michael Bays Transformers Dark of the Moon) Bays sponsors think thats fine the 48-year-old Angeleno is among the most reliable minters of box-office gold. His nine features including Armageddon Pearl Harbor and three Transformers smashes have earned more than 4.5 billion worldwide or nearly 6 billion in real dollars. So when he told the lords of Paramount that hed direct a fourth Transformers picture only if theyd first let him make Pain amp; Gain -- a small feverish docudrama with a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and a pinchpenny (for Bay) budget of 25 million -- of course they said yes. Big names occasionally use this sort of leverage to get a personal project greenlit; Bruce Willis starred in The Sixth Sense after Disney agreed to finance Alan Rudolphs adaptation of the Kurt Vonnegut novel Breakfast of Champions. We probably shouldnt be surprised that Bays bijou effort is no art-house meditation. Pain amp; Gain boasts an even higher decibel level than the Transformers series and a visual clutter that approaches hoarding. Taking full advantage of his first R-rated film since Bad Boys II a decade ago the director provides many moments of gore (a mans head crushed like a casaba by a 45-lb. weight plate) gross-out comedy (a severed big toe fed to a chihuahua) and just plain ewwww (the sight of a fat womans pubic hair sprouting like kudzu below her panty line). The film is not Bay unplugged but Bay unleashed -- the giddy id inside the gaudy showman. It hurtles along like a two-hour cartoon infused with a schoolyard satirists vigor and derision. And on the movies own rascally terms by playing the Sun Gym tragedy the second time as farce its kinda fun. (FIND Michael Bay on the list of Top 10 Music-Video Directors Who Now Direct Movies) On a small plank jutting out of a giant billboard advertising the Sun Gym a human figure can be seen doing pull-up exercises. This is Daniel Lugo (Wahlberg) manager of the workout spa owned by John Mese (Rob Corddry). Danny who did 15 months jail time for fraud has a vision of America and himself big beautiful and ripped. His overweight clients disgust him. Being fat he believes is ""more than sickening. Its unpatriotic."" He hangs with guys who take their bodies seriously enough to pump themselves up with weight regimens and additives available in the locker room. Attending a meeting held by motivational guru Jonny Wu (Ken Jeong) who proclaims that ""Everyones either a do-er or a dont-er"" Danny decides hes a do-er on the fast lane to the American dream. And what will he do? Abduct and fleece Victor ""Pepi"" Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub doing a wilier Joe Pesci) a Colombian Jew whos made millions with a restaurant chain. Now all Danny needs are accomplices. Theyre right at the gym. Adrian Doorbal (Mackie) wants to build himself up until hes so huge he has to ""walk sideways through doors"" -- though his reliance on steroids have given him a case of ""defeated phallus syndrome."" Paul Doyle (Johnson) is a soft-spoken Attica graduate who renounced cocaine and found religion. ""Jesus Christ has blessed me with many gifts"" he tells a man. ""One of them is knocking guys like you the f-- out."" (And Bam) (READ Corlisss take on Dwayne Johnson in G.I. Joe Retaliation) A stupid man may stir sympathy or pity. But the idiot who thinks hes smart and who has the nerve to carry out his cockamamie schemes is a danger to society and himself. Thats Danny too dumb to know hes dumb. Adrian and Paul are game but even lamer. Their plan to kidnap Kershaw in a parking lot goes awry when they corner the wrong BMW. A weapon that Adrian bought doesnt work; ""I need to read the manual"" he mildly observes. When the Three Malefacting Stooges finally capture Kershaw bind him with duct tape and imprison him for nearly a month Paul naively befriends his hostage. Then their murder plot -- to fill Kershaw with liquor and send his car crashing into a wall -- is scuttled because Adrian buckled the victims seat belt. So they drive a car wheel over his head. And that doesnt kill him. (At one point a sentence zips across the screen to insist that ""This is still a true story."") A movie about witless crooks (The Gang That Couldnt Shoot Straight Dog Day Afternoon Fargo Four Lions) usually requires at least one relatively smart person either to catch the bad guys or to sigh knowingly at their imbecilities and clue the viewer that the filmmaker knows theyre dolts. But except for Kershaw and Ed DuBois (Ed Harris) a retired detective who does some sleuthing for Kershaw almost everyone in Pain amp; Gain is dimmer or less attractive than anyone likely to see it. (READ Corlisss review of the scary jihadi comedy Four Lions) The cops are too lazy to follow up on Kershaws story. A hobo pastor (Larry Hankin) whom Paul visits for spiritual guidance starts slathering over the ex-cons ""sweet glistening muskles"" -- yes he pronounces it ""musk-cles."" Another gay stereotype a gun store owner shrieks erotically for the gang to tase him. And when an actor is good-looking like Walhberg Bay shows him drooling in extreme-closeup slo-mo. So lurid is the movies burlesque that a few scenes of the detectives quietly loving banter with his wife (Kelly Rutherfurd) come as a shock greater than any taser. Between grinding out scripts for the three Narnia movies Marcus and McFeely wrote You Kill Me a pretty sweet comedy directed by John Dahl detailing the romance of an alcoholic hit man (Ben Kingsley) and a tart-spoken woman (Tea Leoni). There small characters blossomed; here they fester and wilt. But the writers keep finding clever ways for Danny and his pals to express their solemn idiocy. They also parcel out the voiceover narrative to five characters -- Danny Paul Adrian Kershaw and the detective -- to give viewers a shifting perspective like a battery of cameras at a cage match. (READ Richard Schickels review of You Kill Me) Of course this is not a Marcus-McFelly screenplay but a Bay movie. And whether the writers are pleased with the directors take on their work or as annoyed as Paddy Chayefsky was when Ken Russell zazzed up the script for the 1980 Altered States (leading Chayefsky to use a pseudonym on the film) Pain amp; Gain has Bays signature on it writ large and notarized. For worse or for better he turned what might have been a modest quirky crime comedy into the most gigantic engorged movie ever made on the Hollywood cheap. To Bay size matters and never more so than with the roid gang at Sun Gym. Wahlberg Johnson and Mackie bulked up to be such wide-bodies that the movie looks as if somebody had accidentally pushed the Stretch button on the remote. A few characters come by their girth naturally like Adrians plus-size wife (Rebel Wilson) who already needs to walk sideways through doors. And some have it thrust upon them Krisztina (Keili Lefkovitz) the stripper girlfriend of a porn king (Michael Rispoli) the gang does business with sports a 150cc. implant in each breast. Just the dozen leading actors in this movie -- all of whom lend themselves gleefully to the conspiracy -- look as if they weigh more than the entire population of The Simpsons Springfield. (For perspective theres also an angry dwarf.) (READ TIMEs 10 Questions for Mark Wahlberg) After an hour or so of the guys flexing their mammoths pecs you may start wondering if the movie is a saturnine comment on Hollywoods muscle (or muskle) mania -- of stars who spend many more hours with their personal trainer than they do with their acting teacher. And why shouldnt they? In todays Hollywood where action films aspire to look like Action Comics beefcake is the new cheesecake. Every man has to look like a Greek god painted by Frank Frazetta and every woman... well what women? Boy-meets-girl long ago gave way to guy-on-guy. And that makes Pain amp; Gain either the dead end for Hollywood in its Gargantuan era or a deadpan takedown. With Bay its always hard to know if hes making fun of his audience or himself. The film could be a Bay three-way apology defense and self-parody. For the director Danny Paul and Adrian could represent the three Transformers movies bloated and bustling and with a Hasbro toys mechanical heart. Or Bay could be trying to prove that hes faster and cleverer than his perps and muscular but not quite muscle-bound. All or none of the above its tough trying to psychoanalyze a moviemaker whom most critics think has no soul to scan. (SEE Michael Bays spoof trailer for an Angry Birds movie) Love it or loathe it the movies not boring. Its like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting its instantly intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the films pile-driving self-assurance even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 26 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 26 2013 937AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Michael Bay Written by Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely Starring Mark Wahlberg Anthony Mackie Dwayne Johnson Tony Shalhoub Ed Harris Classification 18A Year 2013 Country USA Language English The combination of the words ""Michael Bay"" and ""steroids"" should be enough to give any moviegoer pause before seeing Bays new movie Pain amp; Gain which is based on the real-life story from the 1990s of a group of Florida gym rats in South Beach who became violent criminals.Bay the director of Armageddon Pearl Harbor and the Transformer movies is Hollywoods most extreme big-screen stylist whose disorienting images of mass destruction have become synonymous with blockbuster overkill. Nominally this is Bays version of an indie film a subculture study along the lines of Goodfellas or Boogie Nights made at the relatively modest budget of 25-million (U.S.). Running at a long 129 minutes this black comedy about balloon-armed dolts and infantile women with porn-star bodies plays like Goodfellas as performed by the Three Stooges. As a genre-mashing exercise its almost interesting but really why bother? Multimedia Pain and Gain The official trailer Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the Chronicles of Narnia movies Captain America) the script focuses on Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg swollen to new muscular dimensions) a petty ex-con working for rich clients at Miamis Sun Gym while hooked on the self-help infomercials of a ridiculous Tony Robbins-style motivational speaker (The Hangovers Ken Jeong) who preaches that its better to be a ""doer"" than a ""donter.""Lugo is a naive dolt (not far from Wahlbergs Dirk Diggler character in Boogie Nights) who has become convinced that its ""un-American"" not to be successful - and that its almost a patriotic act to kidnap and extort money from a sleazy gym customer Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). Lugo enlists fellow trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) whose main characteristic is that hes impotent from abusing steroids as well as simple-minded born-again Christian Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson).After a series of inept kidnapping attempts they finally take Kershaw to a dry-cleaning warehouse where for weeks they subject him to various forms of clumsy torture in an effort to get him to sign over his wealth. Kershaw proves indefatigably obnoxious and resistant even as his kidnappers repeatedly fail to kill him.If that doesnt pulverize your funny bone we later see Lugo move into Kershaws McMansion heading up a Neighbourhood Watch meeting and coaching suburban adolescent boys on how to get laid. The script alters his character almost scene-by-scene One moment hes unbelievably naive the next a smooth-talking con man and after that a socially inappropriate lout.Perhaps the only people more incompetent than the kidnappers are the local Dade County police. The force leaves the business of doling out justice to a laid-back ex-cop and private detective Ed Du Bois (Ed Harris in a gratefully received low-key performance) to take on the job of bringing the pumped-up dolts to justice. Du Bois correctly surmises that the gang will strike again once theyve used up Kershaws money. Their target is another sleazy character phone-sex king Frank Grin (Michael Rispoli) but this time Lugos hot temper lands the bodybuilders in deeper trouble.A good half-hour is spent in the desperate and supposedly hilarious clean-up of a crime scene but the endless dumbness cruelty and frantic reaction from Wahlberg Mackie and Johnson begins to feel like purgatorial grind.While Bays whooshing cameras fevered montages and hot Miami colours provide plenty of visual texture Pain amp; Gain in bodybuilding terms has a lot of reps but little weight. The scripts occasional gestures toward making this an allegory of the failed American dream are extremely unconvincing in the context of a movie that revels in the excesses of macho culture while laughing at the hapless and stupid who cant get it right.

All of those statements are accurate more or less. The double-beefcake sandwich of Wahlberg and Johnson does in fact anchor the film though it tends to provide more dead weight than muscle. And its factual basis -- a series of grisly crimes committed by a group of Miami bodybuilders in 1994 and 1995 -- would hardly seem the stuff of comedy even a dark one. No the most important thing you need to know about this sour attempt to turn tragedy into farce is that its a Michael Bay project. The man behind such loud and unsubtle popular entertainments as ""The Rock"" ""Pearl Harbor"" and the ""Transformers"" franchise brings his trademark truncheon approach to directing something that demands finesse not blunt force the attempt to find humor in the horrible. And the source material is pretty darn horrible. Based on a series of articles by Pete Collins in the Miami New Times ""Pain and Gain"" is the story of Daniel Lugo (Wahlberg) and a group of accomplices who came to be known as the Sun Gym Gang. They perpetrated in roughly this order such crimes as kidnapping torture extortion attempted murder actual murder and finally dismemberment in their pursuit of what their film counterparts describe as the ""American dream."" Their victims are a Miami deli owner (Tony Shalhoub) and a phone-sex entrepreneur and his girlfriend (Michael Rispoli and Keili Lefkovitz). Lugo it should be noted is now on death row along with his partner-in-crime Adrian Doorbal played in the film by Anthony Mackie. Johnson whose actions in the film are slightly less heinous than those of his pals plays a fictional member of the Sun Gym crew a coked-out fundamentalist Christian ex-con named Paul Doyle. The movies surprisingly sluggish first half deals with Lugo Doorbal and Doyles attempt over a month to extort Victor Kershaw -- played by Shalhoub in a fictionalized version of the real-life victim -- through somewhat inept torture methods. Then after Kershaw has signed over all his bank accounts and property the gang tries unsuccessfully to kill him. So far so hilarious right? At least no one has been chopped into pieces with a chain saw . . . yet. The whole thing is played for laughs that almost never come. To be sure the film has its moments but theyre few and far between. Most arrive courtesy of Rebel Wilson who plays Doorbals randy wife a nurse who meets her husband at a clinic specializing in the treatment of steroid-induced impotence. I know nice. Some relatives of Lugo and Doorbals real-life victims have spoken out in anger about what they see as the films attempt to create sympathy for a gang of criminals. The sister of the phone-sex entrepreneur for instance told the Miami Herald ""I dont want the American public to be sympathetic to the killers."" To which I can only say Dont worry. Almost no one in ""Pain and Gain"" is even remotely sympathetic with the possible exception of the private detective (Ed Harris) whose investigation helped bring Lugo and his cronies to justice. The absence of a likable hero makes it really hard to laugh. Not that the rape and homophobia jokes would even give you a chance. The movie is also peppered with sight gags involving explosive diarrhea excessive body hair giant sex toys fake breasts and miscellaneous amputation. At least the films title is half right. Can criminal misbehavior generate humor? Absolutely. Just look at ""The Hangover."" But Bay who is aided and abetted by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely doesnt seem to know where to begin looking for it. Even ""The Hangovers"" Ken Jeong -- playing a motivational speaker whose get-rich-quick schemes provide the impetus for Lugos felonious activities -- provides only momentary relief from the movies overwhelmingly disagreeable tone. ""Pain and Gain"" makes much of the fact that its true reminding us of its veracity with on-screen titles whenever the story begins to strain credulity. Case in point The moment when the chain saw that Lugo and Doorbal are using to cut up victims becomes jammed with human hair. Guess what? Collinss meticulously reported newspaper articles also were true and they werent funny either. Contains obscenity violence torture gore drug use nudity sex and crude humor.Correction An earlier version of this review stated the sister of the phone-sex entrepreneur spoke to the Associated Press. She actually spoke to the Miami Herald.

I can think of a variety of responses to this but they all basically boil down to ""Yeah so what else is new?""There has always been a powerful current of self-mockery or at least self-awareness in Bays ludicrous ""Transformers"" movies which embraced bigness loudness dumbness visual incoherence and cartoonish female pulchritude (see Fox Megan entire career of) as central formal elements and stylistic first principles. I wasnt the only critic to observe that Bays enormous 2011 hit ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" had elements of avant-garde surrealism and elements of high camp and could be described as a ""performance-art act of juvenile Id-fulfillment.""Its perfectly legitimate to argue that the fact that Bays movies are chaotic teen-boy dream landscapes on purpose doesnt make them any good. Or even more to the point that theres really not much difference between celebrating America as a vapid symbolic spectacle and making fun of it. But the argument that Bay is an incompetent idiot after the fashion of fabled Eurocrap auteur Uwe Boll simply doesnt hold water. Indeed the utter shamelessness of the ""Transformers"" pictures and their winking-at-the-audience embrace of utter shamelessness is a large part of their mass appeal and anyone who doesnt understand that hasnt been paying much attention to pop culture over the last few decades.Its all very well to talk about ""Pain amp; Gain"" as Bays pet project or indie film or whatever and at times it feels like a nastier remake of ""Fargo"" transported from the used car lots of the northern Midwest to the gyms of South Florida and given a killer abdominal workout. (I almost recommend a double bill of ""Pain amp; Gain"" and Harmony Korines ""Spring Breakers"" except that it might prove to deliver a toxic overdose of Sunshine State sleaze.) But its much more of a piece with his previous work than that makes it sound. Arguably all Bay has done since ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is shrink the giant robots down to the still-impressive size of Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson remove any pretense of sympathy for any of the characters and thrust the satirical comedy front and center in ""Simpsons"" or ""South Park"" fashion where even bicoastal eggheads cant miss it.If youre looking for journalistic accuracy or dramatic subtlety I might suggest that a Michael Bay movie is not an appropriate place to start. But Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeelys screenplay for ""Pain amp; Gain"" is based with reasonable fidelity on a series of newspaper articles by Pete Collins about the ""Sun Gym gang"" a group of Florida bodybuilders who hatched an inept and sadistic but very nearly successful criminal scheme in the mid-1990s. Wahlberg plays the groups ringleader a personal trainer named Daniel Lugo whose supposedly positive attributes - his patriotism his optimism his can-do initiative - lead him in entirely the wrong direction. If Wahlberg has now built a career on playing deluded American dreamers guys who suggest directions he himself might have gone (or so we imagine) if he werent a movie star Daniel is the most toxic of them all. Hes just smart enough to understand that the people who thrive in America are crooks and hustlers but not smart enough to understand that hes not smart enough to be one.Daniels two sidekicks arent quite as consumed by evil but theyre even dumber. Anthony Mackie gives a sly funny performance as Adrian a fellow trainer whose principal interests in life are bulking up with steroids protein shakes breast milk and other real or apocryphal exercise drugs and pursuing the sort of amply proportioned women known in pornography as ""BBWs."" (Rebel Wilson gets a brief but enjoyable role as his love interest.) But much of the true delight in ""Pain amp; Gain"" - and isnt this often the case? - come from Dwayne Johnson as Paul a born-again 12-step ex-con with multiple felonies in his past and his future. Paul has no chip on his shoulder unlike Daniel (who remembers the rich kids in his neighborhood taking vacations ""to places like Paris and France""). Paul loves Jesus and his sobriety temporary though it may be and genuinely wants only the best for everybody. The fact that he is entirely devoid of self-control or judgment and that he will wind up snorting cocaine off a strippers ass getting his toe shot off during a botched robbery and betraying his so-called friends is a source of wonder and mystery for him. You Might Also Like After himself falling under the spell of an especially idiotic Asian-American self-help guru named Jonny Wu (the inescapable Ken Jeong who nails this assignment) Daniel convinces his camp followers to join him in a plot to kidnap and fleece one of his gym clients a slimeball millionaire named Victor ""Pepe"" Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). And lets say this for Bay and his writers Theres nothing half-assed about the nihilism of ""Pain amp; Gain."" Kershaw is depicted as a verminous creep who richly deserves to lose his bayfront mansion his sports cars his business (the Schlotzskys Deli franchise near the Miami airport) and his offshore accounts in the Bahamas. He might be the only person in this movie less likable than Daniel - at least until Daniel and friends abduct Kershaw and torture him mercilessly (in a warehouse full of homoerotic sex toys) and only fail to kill him because their unnecessarily elaborate ideas about how to commit murder appear to come entirely from bad movies.You see theres the essential paradox of ""Pain amp; Gain"" which veers from remarkably pithy moments of social satire (and quite a few big laughs) to painful and overstylized visual and auditory assault in the great Michael Bay tradition. It makes fun of these criminal lowlife losers for pursuing a vulgar and stupid vision of American success - fast cars leggy girls big houses vicious crimes -- which is precisely the vision Bay has been pimping throughout his filmmaking career. When semi-retired private detective Ed Du Bois (Ed Harris) comes into the story as the only person who believes Kershaws outrageous story about being kidnapped and tortured by bodybuilders hes both enforcing normal standards of morality and also policing the borders of irony and fantasy. Daniel and friends didnt get the great Socratic joke of American life Were constantly told we can have it all but those of us who are savvy enough understand that its a lie. Michael Bay and Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson can have it all maybe and we can enjoy it by proxy from a distance. Have I now talked my way back around to the position that ""Pain amp; Gain"" is a fundamentally immoral and hypocritical picture a scathing satire about the great Ponzi scheme of American life that simultaneously serves to justify it? Well of course. This is a Michael Bay movie Hypocrisy and immorality are its text and subtext and footnotes the coke it snorts off a Croatian hookers spray-tanned bum and the exploding green goo on its stolen banknotes. If anything Bay tries to drive home the point way too forcefully here the point being that hes one of the most important influential and (certainly) representative American film directors of the last 20 years. Did I say he was ""good"" or that I ""liked"" him? I did not and your insistence on such old-fashioned categories is charming in a way. Dont even pretend you dont want to see this and dont come complaining to me if you feel dirty afterward. Isnt that the whole idea? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Review Bays Pain amp; Gain is bargain-budget still excessive - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Bays Pain amp; Gain is bargain-budget still excessive Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic When Michael Bay goes small ""Pain amp; Gain"" happens.Humans handle the bone-crunching. The gore becomes gorier. The dialogue increases substantially too. Metal things may not transform but they still make a world of hurt delivered by ""Pain amp; Gains"" iron-pumping bodybuilders.The suddenly budget-conscious Bay shot the movie in and around his Miami mansion so maybe that reference to ""Mickey Ds fries"" wasnt a joke. And yet he still cant wrap up the action in less than two hours. MORE Latest film reviews from The Times""Pain amp; Gain"" is based on the true story of a kidnapping scam in the mid-90s cooked up by a trio of bodybuilders. Maybe its the steroids maybe they were born that way but the brawny bunch portrayed by Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and a jacked-up Anthony Mackie are really thick in every sense of the word.It makes for some stupid/slap-shtick fun of the Stooges variety -- that is if Larry Curly and Moe had been hunky gym rats engaged in illegal activity.The screenwriting team Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely adapted the story from a series of newspaper articles by Pete Collins about the notorious Florida fiasco. Mamp;M were part of the writing pack for the gentle ""Narnia"" films and the upright citizen ""Captain America."" For ""Pain"" they have gone solo and bad to the bone with mixed results. PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013Some of the dialogue is very snappy some of it a little sappy all of it super salty with the sort of four-letter carpet bombing that ensured an R before the first boob was bared or blood was shed.The ""brains"" behind this mess-up belong to Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) who makes his living as a trainer at a Miami gym. Most of his clients are rich guys he increasingly resents for their funds as well as their flab. A day with motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong) persuades Danny that he can be a ""doer"" not a ""dont-er"" -- Wus bad grammar and bad advice clearly intended.At first Danny is content to take his newfound wisdom to a new gym run by John Mese (Rob Corddry). Hes a great success but before long he wants more. Specifically Danny wants everything that one of his regulars the thoroughly despicable and filthy rich Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) has. He quickly enlists steroid-junkie Adrian (Mackie) and the newly paroled sober and salvation-infused Paul (Johnson).Somehow Danny thinks that they can kidnap Victor force him to sign over all of his assets and not have anyone including the bankers his employees or even his family tip off the police. Weirdly that is basically what happens.But Victor bravely played by Shalhoub turns out to be a surprisingly tough nut to crack. A good deal of the movie is spent in the cracking and a lot of pain is inflicted in the process. The brutality is tough to stomach even for Paul and Adrian; some moviegoers will find it untenable. The extreme measures are so insanely bizarre that reminders this is a true story keep popping up on the screen.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsVictor isnt their only mark or their only mistake. Beyond the scamming there are side stories about medical issues a marriage and a neighborhood watch.Suffice it to say ""Pain amp; Gain"" is not going to overshadow ""The Fighter"" ""Boogie Nights"" or the raunchy fun of ""Ted"" on Wahlbergs vita. Still hes responsible for much of the heavy lifting and he does a decent job of making the movie more bearable. Meanwhile Johnsons Paul is really quite funny as the biggest dolt and the guy whos got religion. Although a word of warning Dont threaten to tell Jesus if you spot Paul sinning. He does not deal with that well.Bay has enlisted a few ""Transformers"" cohorts to help keep things polished including director of photography Ben Seresin and composer Steve Jablonsky. The action is definitely more bare bones -- the films 25-million budget is probably about what the opening sequences cost in most of the directors other films. But that sense of extreme excess over-the-top everything is there from start to finish.

"Pain amp; Gain | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pain-gain ) Pain amp; Gain (United States 2013) April 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli With a title like Pain amp; Gain and Michael Bay at the helm this review looked like a great opportunity for a vitriolic screed but thats not going to happen. Defying expectations Pain amp; Gain not only represents one of the best movies Bay has made (only the second following The Rock to which I have given a positive rating) but one of the standouts of the first four anemic months of 2013. This isnt great cinema but its vastly entertaining in an overblown in-your-face sort of way. Its funny as hell at times with a twisted sense of humor that one typically expects from the likes of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino. The events chronicled in Pain amp; Gain are based on real-life occurrences from the mid-1990s in Dade County Florida. Bay along with handpicked screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely has taken the basic facts as related in Pete Collins newspaper articles and tweaked them to transform the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction reality into the framework for a dark comedy. There are undoubtedly some who will be offended (perhaps mortally so) by this fusion of high-energy filmmaking with laugh-inducing elements and the Grand Guignol but it works on its own terms. Its a pleasant change-of-pace to encounter a Michael Bay movie that doesnt feature silly robots endless CGI and a teenage mentality. Pain amp; Gain focuses on three bodybuilders who concoct a plan by which they can achieve their slice of the American dream by taking it away from someone else. The ringleader Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is obsessed with the idea that hes a ""do-er"" rather than a ""donat-er."" His cohorts are Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a Christian with a penchant for backsliding and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) a muscle-bound bruiser whose abuse of steroids have left him with an ED problem. Their target is businessman Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) who uses Lugo as his personal trainer at a gym. After a few misfires the trio achieves their goal. They hold Lugo hostage and torture him for about a month. After he signs over all his property to Lugo they kill him - or try to. The problem is despite crashing his car blowing it up and running him over they cant get the job done. But the police find his story so implausible that they fail to investigate. Meanwhile Lugo Doyle and Doorbal live high off the hog until the funds dry up and the potential of a repeat scheme gains appeal. Bay generates comedy from some unusual set-ups. The kidnapping misfires are hilarious effectively illustrating how incompetent the criminals are. The scene in which Kershaw is crunched lit on fire and run over (twice) is as funny as any such scene can be. Later in the film Doyle and Doorbal return a chainsaw to Home Depot when it fails to work after getting tangled in a womans hair. And theres a memorable sequence where Doyle gets a few helping hands for a barbeque. Some of this material recalls the warped sense of humor embraced by the Coens (think the woodchipper in Fargo) and Tarantino (""The Bonnie Situation"" in Pulp Fiction) among others. Pain amp; Gain makes no attempt to provide a portrait of the lead trio that is in any way sympathetic. Lugo Doyle and Doorbal are class-A idiots with delusions of grandeur. Their justifications for their actions are absurd. Bay emphasizes this by having each of them provide a voiceover narration during different segments and the things they think are as deranged as one might expect given their personalities. Mark Wahlberg plays Lugo as a violent cousin to his character in Boogie Nights dumb as post obsessed with his physicality and attributing a false sense of importance to himself. The most interesting performance is given by Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. The Rock) who continues to evolve as an actor. Here he plays a multifaceted character and shows that he can handle comedy drama and action equally well. What I wrote in my review of Snitch continues to be valid ""Its nice to acknowledge that The Rock can act - hes got some thespian talent to go along with the brawn and one-liners."" Stylistically Pain amp; Gain employs many of Bays trademark flourishes although the frequent use of slow-motion seems to be a satirical comment on how ubiquitous this approach has become in key moments during testosterone-fueled movies. The level of lighting is punched up so even scenes taking place in supposedly dim locales are easy to see. There arent many explosions - Bays penchant for ""blowing things up real good"" has been neutered here. I suppose Pain amp; Gain could be seen as a dark commentary on the American dream and the way in which Bay composes certain shots (such as one with Lugo in the foreground and an American flag in the background) lends credence to that but thats about as deep as the movie gets. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of Pain amp; Gain is that it illustrates how Bay given a budget thats less than obscene and a passion for the project has the talent and capacity to make something a thinking adult might enjoy. This one wont make a fraction of what his soulless Transformers abominations generated but its better in almost every way imaginable. I look forward to the day when Bay turns his back on the fat paychecks and infantile screenplays and begins doing more of these kinds of films.

Like the Coen Brothers 1996 masterpiece Pain amp; Gain is about small-time crooks whose dumb plans go hideously awry. Theres a despairing humor to the whole mess but of course theres also a darkness the insidious creep of the abyss gnawing at the films edges. But that Im afraid is where the similarities end. For while Fargo and its indie crime movie ilk tend to prefer simple aesthetics and careful wording Pain amp; Gain goes for gusto and rumble; its in some ways the ugliest movie Bay has made though I must admit that despite all the appalling brashness there are hints of a halfway decent film glinting in the glaring Miami sun. Pain amp; Gain is based on the real-life story of the Sun Gym Gang a group of muscle-head roid-ragers led by a body-building conman named Chris Lugo (here played by Mark Wahlberg). Between 1994 and 1995 Lugo and two pals Paul and Adrian (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Anthony Mackie) kidnapped one of Lugos wealthy gym clients tortured him until he signed over all his money and then tried to kill him in elaborate fashion. It didnt work but when they tried the scheme again on a new mark things took a gruesomer turn. Puffed-up and comically inept and overambitious these guys were trying to take the fast lane to the good life and wound up destroying theirs and many others. Bay and his screenwriters adapting from a series of articles from The Miami New Times see this as a decidedly American story something about men of action doing something to get ahead in this world stupidly terribly and monstrously as they might have done it. Its hard to tell whether Pain amp; Gain is giving us heroes antiheroes villains or what. The things they do are certainly awful but this is largely a kinetic brightly hued comedy and Bay films his leads especially Wahlberg with his usual loving slo-mo grandeur his camera low and looking up as if at God or the David. So its morality is muddled but thats not Pain amp; Gains greatest sin. Michael Bay is mostly disgusting. Can I say that? Is that unprofessional? For one thing hes a horrible misogynist. Every woman in this film is solely contextualized by her body whether theyre titted-up and slinky like the dumb Romanian stripper (Bar Paly poor thing) who gets involved in the caper or theyre Rebel Wilson playing the love interest of Mackies character who likes ""big girls."" The word ""bitch"" is thrown around as frequently as Mr. Tarantinos N-word and Bay has his gals wearing dark eyeliner and bubblegum pink lipstick even while working out hard at the gym. (He has a particularly juvenile sexual ideal all pouty and perky but with dark eye makeup that suggests theyre also dirty girls for the right man of course. Its Tea Leoni in Bad Boys its Vanessa Marcil in The Rock its Megan Fox in Transformers and its Paly here. He couldnt really do that with Kate Beckinsale in Pearl Harbor because that was his serious movie but look There are hints.) His women have no value what little agency they have only afforded to them by their bodies. And hes blithe about it He really doesnt care that people have been criticizing him about this for years. Once a Victorias Secret commercial director always a Victorias Secret commercial director I guess. Theres a healthy level of gay panic humor running throughout Pain amp; Gain too the most egregious and upsetting instance being Wahlberg asking a bunch of little boys something to the effect of ""None of you are homos right?"" Its supposed to be funny not because Chris is a dumb lout but because haha gay people are silly. Bay also throws in some hideously unnecessary scat humor and a startling splash of gore. Ugh what a putz this guy is someone we might call an embarrassment to American culture except that his movies tend to do really well. America likes Michael Bay Im afraid. And I must admit that despite all that stuff mentioned above? I didnt hate Pain amp; Gain. Bay is helped by the fact that this is an undeniably interesting story. While the details are wildly exaggerated of course the bones of the true-crime tale remain intact and what grisly and bizarre twists and turns it takes. The movie is narratively all over the place scenes skittering and skipping into one another the pace quickening or slowing with arbitrary abruptness throughout. (Though title cards do occasionally give us the date it was hard to tell time during the movie.) But when we return to the center line of the plot its a satisfyingly grim look into some bleak American greed and stupidity. And I must say Wahlberg is terrific. Hes always at his best when hes in this mode jangly and hyped-up whiny with desperation at moments of crisis and goofily boastful when he thinks things are going just right. This is a variation on his Dirk Diggler character from Boogie Nights (still his finest performance to date) but there are unmistakable tones of his characters from I Heart Huckabees (all the rapid-fire philosophizing) and The Departed (caustic foul-mouthed bluster) in there too. Hes frequently riotously funny blessedly devoid of any of the macho self-consciousness he sports in less interesting movies like Contraband or Max Payne. Yes I did just call Pain amp; Gain interesting. Because it is Dwayne Johnson is also up to something here actually playing a character instead of merely a tower of sinew. Paul was got sober and born-again during a prison stint but his violent coke-addled past aint through with him. His deterioration is what drives the film to its brutal climax and Johnson plays that free-fall fairly well considering the bluntness of the script and the inattentiveness of Bays direction. Tony Shalhoub playing the gangs first mark a nasty and vituperative fellow gets in a few juicy scenes too. There are attempts to actually create some characters here and while Bay ultimately doesnt know what to do with them always rushing off to make his next dirty joke right when things are getting good I admire the efforts of the actors. Would that they had another director and a different script this really might have been something. Ah well. All told I left Pain amp; Gain wondering how it managed to be both Bays most off-putting movie and his most artistically successful. On the one side there is the misogyny the homophobia the pointless gross-out stuff and of course the films choppy and overly aggressive construction. But on the other theres the genuinely compelling crime story theres Wahlbergs deft work and all the gorgeous Miami vistas. The city is Bay-ian paradise filled with sunlight and swaths of garish color. Its a dichotomous picture both ugly and alluring. In fact I can think of only one recent film that provoked a similar reaction. Forget Fargo. This might be Michael Bays Spring Breakers.

Two teenage boys encounter a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey) and form a pact to help him evade bounty hunters and to reunite him with his true love. Also starring Reese Witherspoon. (Photo/Video Roadside Attractions) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com April 25 2013 613 p.m. ET In the hallway after the screening of ""Mud"" people were quoting their favorite lines from the movie a newly minted American classic so Ill quote one of my favorites here ""I dont traffic in the truth too often but I did love her."" Standing alone in its own paragraph the line will have lost its original flavor but its a heartbreaker coming out of Matthew McConaugheys mouth. He plays a charismatic drifter named Mud in Jeff Nicholss third feature which traffics unerringly in truth delicious surprise unadorned beauty and unforced wisdom. Muds charisma lies in the wide eyes of his beholders a couple of 14-year-olds who come upon him hiding out from the law and other pursuers on a little island in the Mississippi River; his literal hideout is an abandoned boat nestled high in the branches of a tree where it was deposited by a flood. The movie belongs to the teenage buddies as much as to the title character and echoes of Mark Twain are neither accidental nor incidental. This coming-of-age story focuses mainly on Ellis ( Tye Sheridan) who like his best friend Neckbone ( Jacob Lofland) lives on the banks of an Arkansas tributary in a community of makeshift houseboats. Others may view Mud as nothing more than a scruffy murderer on the run but the kids see him at least for a while as a romantic renegade living out a violent adventure in the service of undying love. Hes a marvelous figure the product of flawless writing--more about that later--plus a brilliant performance thats no less subtle for being theatrical. Mr. McConaughey is a past master of sparkly narcissism. Thats part of what pulls the boys into their heros wobbly orbit from the very first moment they see him up close squinting in the summer sun with a cigarette in his teeth. But this portrayal the best work of the actors career goes far beyond picturesque poses. The man really is a romantic richly nourished by self-delusion and Mr. McConaughey with his musical voice and commanding physique sustains a delicate balance between Muds poetic yearning for his girlfriend Juniper--shes played to slatternly perfection by Reese Witherspoon--and his survival instinct which prompts him to enlist his naive acolytes as accomplices to his escape. The Southern-gothic extravagance of this guy is worthy of Tennessee Williams but Mr. Nichols an Arkansan born and bred has made a film of striking originality. The same could be said about his 2007 debut feature ""Shotgun Stories"" which also took place in Arkansas and his 2011 ""Take Shelter"" which was set in rural Ohio. Both of those films turned on formidable performances by the same superb actor Michael Shannon (who has a small but significant role in ""Mud""). Both explored difficult subjects--blood feud and revenge in the former apocalyptic visions in the latter--with clarity and meticulous craftsmanship. But their taciturn tone was more admirable than welcoming while ""Mud"" invites us in with open arms and treats us to a terrific tale zestfully told. (And beautifully photographed by Adam Stone.) More on Mud How Jeff Nichols Got Personal in His New Film Mud Before and after everything else its a tale of love. Ellis is a lover-in-training hormones pounding and cortex vibrating with confusion. Epic love is what he feels though lesser mortals might call it puppy love for a high-school girl who gives him brief but befuddling encouragement. Love is what his parents have fallen out of. ""You cant trust love"" his father tells him. ""If youre not careful itll up and run out on you."" Because he needs to believe in love Ellis sees Mud and Juniper for the true lovers Mud claims them to be rather than the half-cracked fantasist and unprincipled slut they are. ""Why are you helping us?"" Juniper asks Ellis who has become their faithful go-between. ""Because"" the boy replies with sweet simplicity ""you love each other."" The movie itself is easy to love almost every frame of it although I wish we could see exactly how Mud and his ardent acolytes get the boat out of the tree. But that omission is likable at the very least since its probably a result of the productions limited budget which is not in evidence anywhere else. ""Mud"" stands as a model of what an independent feature can be starting with the homely grabber of a title which would never have made it out of a studios focus group. As a director Mr. Nichols has a rare gift for shaping or allowing naturalistic performances that seem entirely spontaneous. The veteran actor writer and director Sam Shepard has never been more mesmerizing than he is in the role of Tom Blankenship a houseboat dweller who may or may not as Mud contends have gone to Yale and worked for the CIA. Tye Sheridan as Ellis is too young to be a veteran of any kind; his only prior screen experience was as the youngest son in Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life."" At first I wasnt sure about his performance which can be vocally inexpressive from time to time. But thats fine hes an honest presence and his manifest honesty makes Ellis all the more endearing. The boy is by turns guileless shrewd sentimental screw-loose aggressive and constantly checking out his surroundings for clues to how the adult world lives loves and lies. (He doesnt have the movies last word but he has its last telling glance.) Motion pictures rich in character and language are often adapted from literary sources but Mr. Nicholss screenplay is original in the fullest sense of the word. Its full of great phrases--Mud describes an evil rival as ""the triple-six real-deal Scratch""--as well as great lines ""We knew to be afraid of snakes long before we ever got into this world"" Mud says with an emphasis on the word ""this"" that bespeaks his private vision of another sphere. In three features over the course of six years Mr. Nichols has offered a vision of American life that is regional though never provincial. But ""Mud"" suggests that theres nowhere he cant go. Its a movie that holds out hope for the movies future. At Any Price ENLARGE Dennis Quaid Sony Pictures Classics Watch a clip from the film ""At Any Price."" A farming familys business is threatened by an unexpected crisis further testing the relationship between a father (Dennis Quaid) and his rebellious son (Zac Efron). (Photo/Video Sony) Whatever your expectations of ""At Any Price"" expect them to be flipped. Take this example from Ramin Bahranis strong and surprising drama set in Iowas corn country. Henry Whipple ( Dennis Quaid) a rapaciously successful farmer and seller of genetically modified seeds is lamenting the passing of the old days when everything seemed so simple. But Henrys father played by Red West has no patience for such nostalgia. ""Let me tell you what simple is"" the old man replies. ""Its a 48-row planter that drives itself with air conditioning and GPS."" Father and son are locked into the same ethos. Acquire ever more acreage. Dominate the seed business. Expand or die. Its a long way from traditional family farming but a tale that rings true despite some melodramatic manipulations and a chilling portrait of a man who devours what he can regardless of the consequences. Mr. Quaid has long been an effortlessly likable star. Yet theres something wrong with Henrys charm at the outset an exuberance thats eerily out of scale and its tempting to fault the actor until you realize how skillfully even bravely hes building a compulsive gladhander of a character who smiles without warmth speaks without listening and lectures his rebellious son Dean ( Zac Efron) without understanding what the boy wants or indeed who he is. Mr. Bahrani directed from a script he wrote with Hallie Elizabeth Newton. The excellent cast includes Kim Dickens Clancy Brown Maika Monroe and Heather Graham. Michael Simmonds was the cinematographer. Heres another film along with ""Mud"" thats in the American grain but a genetically conditioned grain of unforgiving fathers and overweening ambition. Its powerful stuff. --J.M. The Reluctant Fundamentalist ENLARGE Riz Ahmed and Liev Schreiber IFC Films In the best of times meaning before the Boston Marathon American audiences might have approached ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" with reluctance of their own. Mira Nairs film is a clumsy adaptation of Mohsin Hamids novel in which a young Pakistani man Changez tells his story to an unnamed American over dinner at a cafe in his native Lahore. Its the story of a gifted young mans love affair with the United States--a degree from Princeton a prestigious job on Wall Street--until 9/11 after which he grows disaffected undergoes a gradual radicalization and embraces however conflictedly the cause of Muslim fundamentalism. The book was itself a problematic source for a mainstream feature not only because of its substance but because it was written in the form of an extended monologue--no other characters no dramatic structure just talk. This is of course the worst of times for the film to debut but its problems are compounded by a screenplay that hangs the coarsely conceived trappings of a political thriller on Mr. Hamids literary tour de force. Now the unnamed American is a shadowy CIA operative Bobby Lincoln played by Liev Schreiber. Now flashbacks of Changezs life in the U.S. including his fraught romance with a photographer played not very well by Kate Hudson alternate with a synthetic present-tense plot that turns on a political kidnapping in Lahore. The movies failures are all the more unfortunate because they detract from its central and conspicuous success the performance of Riz Ahmed in the title role. Mr. Ahmed turns the quicksilver quality of the books internal monologue into a tour de force of his own creation. Hes a bright star in a dim constellation. --J.M. Pain amp; Gain ENLARGE Dwayne Johnson Anthony Mackie and Mark Wahlberg in Pain amp; Gain. Paramount Pictures Watch a clip from the Michael Bay film ""Pain amp; Gain."" A trio of bodybuilders (Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie) get caught up in an extortion ring and a kidnapping scheme that goes terribly wrong. (Photo/Video Paramount) Michael Bays absurdist comedy is all pain no gain and an utter monstrosity. It may be the most unpleasant movie Ive ever seen and Im not forgetting ""Freaks"" which ""Pain amp; Gain"" resembles come to think of it. Instead of misshapen sideshow performers the camera dwells on three grotesquely bemuscled body builders played by Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie. The story--a euphemism for willed chaos set in Miami Beach and distantly descended from fact--concerns the trios hapless venture in kidnapping and extortion with a give-thanks-for-what-you-have homily bolted on. ENLARGE Dwayne Johnson Paramount Pictures Mr. Bay is a reigning maestro of extremely expensive and hugely profitable blockbusters most notably the ""Transformers"" franchise. By comparison ""Pain amp; Gain"" produced for 26 million is a chamber piece. Mr. Bay made it he has said because he got tired of being criticized for making blockbusters and wanted to do something small and quirky. But he hasnt been criticized for making blockbusters. He has been criticized for making hollow and assaultive blockbusters and what do you know ""Pain amp; Gain"" turns out to be not only hollow and assaultive but frenzied madly violent and skullnumbingly loud. So much for transformation. --J.M. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern.

"Pain amp; Gain pumps glory into true crime story review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPain amp; Gain pumps glory into true crime story review Michael Bays ""modest"" 25-million Pain amp; Gain stars Mark Wahlberg and a very funny Dwayne Johnson as gym rats turning to crime.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. April 25 2013Pain amp; Gain Starring Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson Anthony Mackie Tony Shalhoub and Ed Harris. Directed by Michael Bay. 130 minutes. Opens April 26 at major theatres. 18APutting aside the real-life maimings and murders Michael Bays comic crime drama Pain amp; Gain brings fun to the multiplex with its story of knucklehead bodybuilders with pumped-up dreams and 98-pound weakling brains.But its also a dark ride showing that Bay has something more going on in his filmmaking arsenal than Transformers and Pearl Harbor. Yes its still Bay and he cant resist the relentless noise quick cuts and an explosion or three even as he tries a cinematic changeup.Article Continued BelowPain amp; Gains budget was a ""modest"" (by Bay standards) 25 million so there was no money for robots. But we do get a slow-motion close-up Taser to the temple that causes a character to erupt saliva like Vesuvius. Seems Bay just cant help himself.""Unfortunately this is a true story"" were told at the outset -- and reminded again about 90 minutes in when things seem too weird to be possible -- in this tale of a trio of dumb-as-barbells gym rats who pursue their version of the American dream.Mark Wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo a simpleton personal trainer at a Miami gym who interprets the ""be a doer"" message from TV motivational guru Johnny Wu (The Hangovers Ken Jeong) to mean he should kidnap and extort all he owns from one of his clients mouthy rich guy Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub).Shades of A Fish Called Wandas Otto heres a criminal mastermind who if brains were dynamite couldnt blow his nose.Adrian Doorbal (The Hurt Lockers Anthony Mackie) a fellow bodybuilder suffering some unwelcome side effects in the downstairs department due to steroids joins team Lugo. And then they happen upon mountainous Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a pumped-up tattooed born-again lug working out at the gym.Johnson turns out to be the best thing about Pain amp; Gain bringing a consistently funny albeit one-note performance as a simple soul who yearns to do the right thing thanks to AA and Catholic guilt but just cant seem to manage it.They all have their reasons for wanting that slice of the American pie whether its Lugos dream of a huge lawn and a rider-mower to tame it or Doorbals desire to buy that dream house and fill it with weights and the salty-talking nurse (pleasingly played by Rebel Wilson) he met at the erectile dysfunction clinic.As for Doyle it could be a room filled with puppies and kittens. Or maybe a washtub of cocaine. Or whatever Lugo tells him he wants.Kidnapping Kershaw then holding him captive while Lugo legally chips away at his fortune by illegal means is a breeze compared to knocking him off. He just wont die which results in events that are more than a little macabre.Enter retired cop Ed Du Bos (Ed Harris) hired by Kershaw to find the steroid stooges who left tire tracks on his face after the local cops dismiss him. Ed rightly figures the guys will need another score to keep up their lavish lifestyles. True enough; theyve already targeted porn merchant Frank Grin (Michael Rispoli of Kick-Ass).This kidnapping is considerably rougher -- and bloodier -- than the first and not nearly as successful. Problems mount like how to remove fingerprints from the victims or the return policy on a bloodied hair-clogged chainsaw at the local Home Depot.Pain amp; Gains postscript noting that two of the gym gang is still on Florida death row should add a sobering note but its hard to pull people back to reality when theyve been guffawing at the sight of Wahlberg (in his 90s-flashback tighty whities no less) hacking up bodies in a hairnet and ""Kiss the Cook"" apron.The script penned by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (Chronicles of Narnia and Captain America franchises) ensures the verbal action keeps up with Bays often-frenetic pace.As for the new Michael Bay hes still got visible traces of the old Michael Bay.

Are You Currently Using Steroids? Credit Paramount Pictures Watch A Clip From Pain amp; Gain - I Need To See Badges I Need To See Badges Credit Paramount Pictures For Michael Bay the director of Armageddon and the Transformers movies to comment on the excesses of American culture would be a little like -- well Michael Bay commenting on the excesses of American culture. And yet thats exactly what he does with Pain amp; Gain a stranger-than-fiction yarn about a South Florida crime spree that points and snickers in the direction of precisely the supersized grotesquerie thats long been Bays stock-in-trade. He blankets the film in a tone of smug self-awareness that obscures everything but its bald hypocrisy. A modest little comedy by Bays standards -- and an unwieldy behemoth by any others -- Pain amp; Gain gets some early comic mileage out of the get-rich-quick aspirations of a musclehead who believes hes entitled to a big steroidal hunk of the American dream. This would be Mark Wahlberg channeling the dim naivete he brought to his starry-eyed young porn star in Boogie Nights as Daniel Lugo a pumped-up Miami gym trainer who wants more from life than a crummy apartment and a used Fiero. His job brings him close to the vanilla-scented elite but only close enough for a seductive whiff before the next monied client walks through the door. Inspired by a motivational speaker (Ken Jeong) who talks of ""doers"" and ""dont-ers"" before skipping the next yacht out of town Daniel sees an angle when a client sandwich-shop magnate Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) brags about the millions he has stuffed in offshore bank accounts. Daniel recruits two other gym rats -- born-again cocaine fiend Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) and phallically challenged roid-abuser Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) -- as partners for a crude smash-and-grab job. All the three have to do is kidnap and sedate Kershaw get him to sign over his lucrative accounts and release him like a fleeced sheep. Things do not youll be startled to hear go as planned -- mainly because the planners lack the collective brainpower to knock over a lemonade stand. They survive (and thrive) for as long as they do only through brute force and moral vacancy a potent combination for criminal mischief-makers. But the three men are incapable of long-term strategizing which seems right for drug-enhanced muscleheads They can grasp the immediate gains of bigger bodies and available women but cant visualize a future that will inevitably turn them into Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler. Working from Pete Collins true-crime book Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeelys screenplay uses the multinarrator effect of films like Martin Scorseses Casino to get inside the conspirators empty heads while Bays camera lays out their music-video dreams. When Pain amp; Gains caper is still in the planning stages Wahlbergs excited monologues about America -- a country that started with ""13 scrawny colonies"" before becoming the beefed-up juggernaut it remains today -- can be a gas. The actor has a talent after all for investing even rogues like Daniel with a childlike innocence thats oddly winning. Wahlberg brings his usual charming swagger to Daniel but even that cant save Michael Bays wretchedly excessive film. Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures But as the film grinds along Bays exhausting supply of macho consumerist images -- from the fleets of Lamborghinis to the low-angle buffet of South Beach hard bodies -- undercut the films attempts at social commentary. Hes the last person in Hollywood who has any business decrying the consequences of a culture that encourages taking shortcuts and living large. Its impossible to leave the film believing that Daniels intentions were corrupt; with Bay telling the story its just his execution that was lacking. This is Bays attempt to make Fargo but without the moral ballast of Frances McDormands pregnant cop around to personify the virtues of a simple decent well-proportioned life. The bodies pile up -- and for what the film asks just as McDormand does in the back of a cruiser when the case has come to a bloody end. ""For what?"" is a rhetorical question in Fargo. In Pain amp; Gain the wages of murder and sin have a luxurious appeal that even Daniels downfall cant diminish.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 610am on Friday Apr. 26 2013 Friday Apr. 26 2013 Thursday Apr. 25 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram To hear director Michael Bay tell it his latest film Pain amp; Gain might as well be an indie arthouse movie.After all it only cost 25 million (lunch money for the man who unleashed the blockbusters Pearl Harbor Bad Boys and Armageddon) has a minimum of explosions is based on a real-life crime spree from the mid-90s has a sense of humor (intentional this time) and came this close to co-starring Albert Brooks.Sundance here he comes.But at heart its still a Michael Bay movie loud as a Harley at midnight empty as a dance club at noon yet as beautiful to look at as a sunrise in Miami where its set.Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie play Daniel Paul and Adrian bodybuilders with IQs only slightly higher than their percentage of body fat who are tired of their 9-to-5 grind. Daniel a personal trainer decides to kidnap one of his rich clients a self-made loudmouth named Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub in the part originally intended for Brooks) and torture him until he signs over all of his assets. Then they can kill him.Trouble is Kershaw survives the ordeal hires a cagey private detective Ed (Ed Harris) to do the job the Miami PD wont do (the cops assume that since Kershaw is half-Colombian he must have been involved in some shady drug cartel-related shenanigans). It doesnt take long for Ed to figure out whats going on -- especially since our boys are now living South Beach large and executing other poorly thought out crimes like the broad-daylight robbery of an armored-truck driver and the kidnapping of a porn kingpin and his girlfriend.Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely ( Captain America the ""Narnia"" movies) as a jokey buddy movie Pain amp; Gain seems to want to make a statement about the American Dream but its message is a bit murky. Unlike Spring Breakers another stylishly shot film about Florida dimwits looking for an easy payday Pain amp; Gain doesnt get below its gleaming surface.Its too long (two hours plus) and perhaps too violent for some -- closer to vintage Tarantino than Bays Transformers. So instead of robot-on-robot punch-ups theres a guy getting his face rolled over by a car and another slammed in the face with a weight.There are some positives an energetic Wahlberg pumped up like the Michelin Man is obviously having a lot of fun; Shalhoub possesses an understated menace; and Bay ravishingly captures Miamis seductive sun-drenched tropical torpor while also creating scenes that dazzle with a sense of movement.But when its over -- and the faces and the fates of the people on whom the film is based flash on the screen -- the realization hits that this was no joke. And that Bay may not have been the best person to tell their sad twisted story. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

(PARAMOUNT PICTURES) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 25 2013 347 PM Title Pain amp; Gain Film Info R Violence nudity sexuality language. Area theaters. If ""Pain amp; Gain"" were a late-night infomercial it would scream GREAT RESULTS OR YOUR MONEY BACK Unfortunately director Michael Bay makes no such offers. But in a flawed film he does offer one great deal Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson as raging bulls hoping to become junior Tony Montanas. Wahlberg and Johnson are the saving graces of an in-your-face movie about weightlifters who kidnap extort and dismember their victims. Sometimes the steroided-up style lands like a dumbbell on your head though its nowhere near as bombastic as Bays ""Transformers"" films. Based as onscreen titles keep reminding us on an outlandish true story ""Pain amp; Gain"" is told via a near-constant voiceover. In 1994 Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) is a Miami personal trainer whose hard work and striving for physical perfection is not reflected in his bank account. Danny goes to shouty self-improvement seminars yet cant bulk up his future. Then the gym gets a new client wealthy restaurateur Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). Danny gets a clue Hell abduct Kershaw and force him to sign away his wealth. Adrian (Anthony Mackie) Dannys fellow trainer agrees to help but they need one more person. Enter Paul Doyle (Johnson) a born-again ex-con whose ""Team Jesus"" T-shirts and sweet nature are for real. As the plan keeps changing and Kershaw refuses to cooperate by either signing or dying Doyle gets second thoughts. Add to this that these guys keep the opposite of a ""low profile"" and things keep going wrong -- just as a P.I. (Ed Harris) starts to sniff around. Tony Shalhoub plays a wealthy restaurateur targeted by kidnappers. (Paramount Pictures) Based on a magazine article ""Pain amp; Gain"" has a surprisingly empathetic approach to the disenfranchisement guys like Danny feel. In his protein-boosted reality he deserves more because he wants more. Bay may not linger on that but the savvy Wahlberg gets it. Theres a ""why not me?"" tinge to Danny that makes him endearing even as his amorality is busy bench-pressing his stupidity. But Bay fills so much of the movie with caricatures and craziness; the story would have sufficed. Shalhoub delivers whats needed but gets cartoonish. Rebel Wilson pops up to apparently improvise some bawdy talk and Rob Corddry as the gyms weaselly manager sneers with aplomb. At least Wahlberg is matched by guys who can punch his weight. Mackie gets to jack up the nutsiness and still make Adrian the voice of reason. And Johnson perfectly blends the two sides of his screen persona. Always one-part supersized tough guy and two parts endearing family star Johnson finds the humor in a man roasting severed hands on a grill as much as he does the soul of a guy gripping tight to redemption in the midst of roid rage. ""Pain amp; Gain"" is arguably too much of everything -- everyone jabbers on incessantly and the movie is in love with its own outrageousness -- but its biggest lift comes from the pumped-up Wahlberg and Johnson. They manage to find the humanity in all the adrenalized muscle. Magic moment A plan to get rid of evidence heats up. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint As an eyes-only experience ""Pain amp; Gain"" is impressive in an overbearing sort of way. Long-lens shots of Miami sunsets hot bodies around turquoise swimming pools and big orange fireballs. Say what you will about Michael Bays taste for brain-grindingly stupid dialogue Swiss cheese plotting and female characters in lip gloss and string bikinis. His signature style total bayhem is as unmistakable as the roar and diesel tang of a monster truck rally. If that chaos-on-steroids quality is what you love about the guy his latest will wallop your involuntary nervous system in the manner you enjoy. For everyone else it will be death by aggravation. In a story based on a real-life 1990s murder spree Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie play bonehead Florida bodybuilders. All around them people are living large while our antiheroes little men in big bodies can barely scrape together the rent. After a session with a glib life coach (played to the arrogant hilt by Ken Jeong) Wahlberg decides that anything is possible for ""a doer."" And the quickest route to overnight wealth is doing some rich people. As in kidnap extort and kill. Wahlberg assures man-child Johnson that itll be quick and painless. ""Ive watched a lot of movies"" he says. ""I know what Im doing."" The trio become spectacularly unsuccessful partners in crime. The film plays out as a perverse comedy of errors. Their first mark a deeply creepy Tony Shalhoub is tough enough to stand up to long rounds of torture refusing to sign over his property with near-inhuman bullheadedness. When its time to dispose of him he proves unkillable. Hes given an OD of pills and liquor put through a high-speed car crash set afire and run over by the crooks twice. When he survives it all the police understandably disbelieve his tale. Theres more with Ed Harris as a sardonic private eye a Christian-rocker gun dealer a second round of fatal robberies and ... never mind. It doesnt matter. Twists and subsidiary characters pile on bloating the film beyond repair. Where inspired violent comedies like ""Seven Psychopaths"" and ""Fargo"" deliver their jolts with deadpan tongue-in-cheek precision ""Pain amp; Gain"" hits its thumb with the hammer. Every. Single. Time. Comedy relies on a clockwork connection between cause and unintended effect. Bays movies are about the cacophony of everything happening at once. Here the camera flops around like a newly hooked fish. Wahlberg Mackie and especially Johnson have good looks strong comic chops and innate amiability. Still its impossible to connect emotionally with their characters. It would be nice to imagine that Bay is making a point that in movies good people are always beautiful bad people are always ugly and in real life its often the opposite. But lets not kid ourselves the guy is shallower than a puddle. His lead actors are presented as clueless dorks not monsters. They dress up in Halloween ninja costumes to kidnap folks how cute is that? Sure they stack up severed limbs like cordwood but theyre really underdogs with some amusing flaws. Their victims are condescending jerks or worse overweight women. Theyre photographed to look as unappealing as possible. Theyre asking for it. Paramount Pictures From left Dwayne Johnson Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Mackie add little in the way of brains to ""Pain amp; Gain"" director Michael Bays latest chaos-on-steroids film. The problem isnt the triple-gainer difficulty of making a yukfest out of a horrific crime. ""Bernie"" the Jack Black/Shirley MacLaine story of a real-life Texas killer was brutally funny disturbing and honest fun to watch without making fun of its subjects. ""Pain amp; Gain"" could have been a dark comedy about lowlifes chasing the high life but lacks the guiding vision to hold its clashing elements in balance. It drops the weights with a big clattering crash.

"Movie review Pain amp; Gain - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Michael Bay does Fargo -- for dummies Share Tweet Bcom - Article MobileFriendly - Methode Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 04.25.13 | 310 PM The news that Michael Bay the grinning schlockmeister behind the ""Transformers"" franchise ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" was directing a special-effects-free comedy actually piqued some peoples interest this critics included. Who knows we thought Maybe the guy would turn out to be good at something besides making ridiculous amounts of money. No such luck. ""Pain amp; Gain"" a jokey but fatally tone-deaf true-crime caper plays like ""Fargo"" for idiots. Its final proof if you need it that Bay is a director of great mechanical skill and no discernible talent which means that he can pull off a camera shot or an action sequence to make you gasp but is hapless at making a movie that holds together for more than five minutes at a time let alone from one end to the other. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Mark Wahlberg through the years ""Pain amp; Gain"" is based on the misadventures of a trio of Miami bodybuilders named Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) Paul Doyle (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) who -- as reported in a late-1990s series of articles for Miamis New Times on which the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is based -- kidnapped and tortured a local business magnate so he would sign over his assets to them. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Somewhat amazingly -- and despite the trios bungled attempts to murder their victim -- this scam succeeded only falling apart when they tried to repeat the trick on another high-roller and his girlfriend who did in fact end up dead and dismembered in a couple of oil drums at the bottom of a swamp. Are you laughing yet? The script which is reasonably clever tries to pitch this as a dark farce about the American dream gone stupid. Wahlbergs Lugo is the putative mastermind a pumped-up personal trainer who buys into the slick self-help jive of a local motivational guru (Ken Jeong) and decides to be a ""do-er"" rather than a ""dont-er."" He recruits the steroid-addled Doorbal and the sweetly dim Doyle a born-again ex-con to help shake down Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) a foulmouthed deli king. Heres a problem that a lot of movies ""based on true stories"" run into They think theyre excused from making their stories believable in movie terms. ""Pain amp; Gain"" is far-fetched enough without introducing a Romanian stripper (Bar Paly) who thinks the boys are CIA agents or sending the heroes back to Home Depot to replace a chainsaw with human hair stuck in its teeth. The larger problem is that Bay jumps awkwardly from scene to scene and attitude to attitude -- the editing is shockingly clumsy -- without any overarching idea of what his movies about. Is ""Pain amp; Gain"" a satire of the American dream? A comically brutal crime comedy? A Florida freak show? Its never clear so were never clear how to take it. Bay is unable to establish a comic rhythm or a larger momentum and by the second hour of the unnecessary two-hour running time the movie has turned hectic and intensely unpleasant with characters grilling severed human hands on a backyard barbecue and Wahlbergs shaggy likability long gone in the Miami breeze. What can you say about a movie where The Rock gives the most subtle and sympathetic performance? Just that Bay might be better off sticking with two-dimensional action heroes and snap-together robots rather than going for human characters and dilemmas. Late in the going ""Pain amp; Gain"" brings in Ed Harris as Ed Du Bois the private detective who brought Lugo and company down; he has a few scenes with Emily Rutherford as his wife that are virtual clones of the domestic moments between policewoman Marge Gunderson and her husband in ""Fargo."" The difference is that the Coen brothers held us expertly in a spot between ironic laughter and appalled fascination. Bay just rubs our nose in mayhem and giggles at the mess hes made.

Around the time when some filmmakers who overtly embrace a classicist agenda became by that fact boring. ""Pain amp; Gain"" which opens tomorrow is a brash vulgar exhilaratingly vigorous spontaneously complex hoot of a true-crime movie. Its based on reporting by Pete Collins about events that took place from December 1994 through June 1995. The bare facts of the story are strange enough but Bay--with the screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely--juices the action with comic exaggeration that brings the foolishness of its criminal trio to the fore even while projecting in overbright lights like cracked megawatt sunlamps sizzling over their heads the delusional magnitude of their enterprise and reflecting it back into the pop-culture stream on which it floats. The very definition of a movie director is someone who makes something in images and sounds and here Bay gets hold of a story that offers a firm and distinctive framework which he elaborates with a palpable sense of excitement and discovery that runs the length and breadth of his movie from its angles and colors to its sets costumes and of course performances. Its not a formal masterwork that reinvents the overpraised and often-misattributed skill of storytelling; rather it resets to an accurate present-day time the very notion of a mainstream mode of storytelling that rejoins the best discursive digressive freewheelingly apostrophizing traditions of playwrights novelists and their studio-era heirs. Its vigor profusion and raucous humor dont advance the art of storytelling but the movie simply outruns outjumps and outshines many of the neurotic etiolated and retentive varieties that are praised as models of narrative clarity and formal precision. Mark Wahlberg struts and swaggers his way through the movie as Daniel Lugo a buff weightlifting trainer who has already gotten caught in one shady get-rich-quick scheme (in the guise of one David Lowenstein). His ego puffed out to the breaking point by a motivational huckster (Ken Jeong) whose seminar he attends (""Im a doer"") Lugo decides to make his grab for the brass ring a client at the gym Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) a crude and boastful self-made businessman who chatters about his wealth. Lugo recruits a mild-mannered naive colleague Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) and a mighty and gargantuan but penitent ex-con clinging desperately to the straight-and-narrow Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) in a plot to kidnap Kershaw and compel him to sign over his assets. But its no surprise that the plan quickly goes astray (first foiled in a scene that ends with the word ""Shabbat""); the three stooges are way out of their league. Lugo who thinks he learned all that he needs to know from watching movies and his partners outrageously outdo each others screwups. The tough contemptuous Kershaw refuses to sign and refuses to die even as his captors grow increasingly--and unintentionally improvisationally--more barbarically brutal. Word of these doings (in a twist theres no need to divulge) reaches an idled jaded yet principled private eye (Ed Harris) who begins to pull on a few loose threads and unravels the whole shoddy scheme. This thumbnail sketch of the story hardly does justice to the teeming jaunty swinging profusion with which Bay realizes it. Each of the characters shines with the kind of restrained exaggeration thats familiar from films by say Preston Sturges and that the Coen brothers have made their own but that Bay approaches without irony. It isnt a matter of whether he loves or admires his characters; they amaze him and he delights in revealing the folds of their peculiar stories. He slips backstory and sidebars into the movie with an untroubled directness and lines the soundtrack copiously with the scripts zingy voice-over monologues for all of its main characters whose self-defining self-deluding rhetoric sheds light on the glib allure of foolish ideas for stunted characters who fall under the sway of foolish plans and put them foolishly into action. Theres no symbolic significance to the movie no great philosophical import. If Bay is saying anything it can be summed up as ""Dont kidnap people schmuck."" His characters are regressive; the mens attitude toward women tends to the basely consumerist (with the exception of the mild-mannered uxorious Adrian) and their attitude toward life is conspicuously commercially consumerist. But Bays approach is equal-opportunity ridicule he shows people of both genders and many ethnicities and diverse classes and walks of life to be equally prone to venal self-interest and voracious delusional idiocy which emerges in sharply comic details. Its a movie in which the asides and the touches carry the weight of satire and trigger the laughter while the forceful plunge of the plot--emphasized by titles superimposed on-screen to punctuate the action--conveys a simple wonder at the woeful yet wild ways of the world. Bay briskly and unobtrusively goes for the inner life and presumes that he can get at it. Slow-motion shots followed by slamming cuts monumentalizing angles and overbright colors suggest characters who are spinning loose as heroes of their own living mythology. The movies way with character is unsophisticated but ample; its way with process is slender. There arent many moments of gradual unfolding or quiet reflection. The movies subjectivity is strong but not deep and its easy to imagine how a full meticulous and reserved version of the story could be a seventeen-hour miniseries in existential-crime mode. Not all of the comic exaggerations are equally nuanced yet its occasional crude derision is balanced by the undertone of strange pathos in the eyes of Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson who knows that his great might needs great restraint from a still greater force. Hollywood is a world of power in which lots of money and the light of fame are fought over by tough and practical people. The most knowing arent always the finest aesthetes which is why it isnt necessarily the greatest artists who deliver the finest memoirs and it may well be those who wouldnt dare tell--and have no reputational incentive to do so--who have the best stories and can draw the sharpest clearest conclusions. The comparison of ""Pain amp; Gain"" to ""Spring Breakers"" is inevitable--both are stories of movie-inspired naifs who slip into crime unprepared. But Bays movie to me feels more like a shifted version of ""The Player"" a sort of inside-Hollywood movie by someone who has been around long enough to see plenty of crashing and burning of follies and even of crimes and who though not withholding judgment remains curious and amazed. It feels like a young mans movie made by someone with the calloused experience of an elder--not the work of a reflective filmmaker but of one who takes a sudden and even self-surprising pleasure in seeing what hes filming. Its superficial heartiness and sincere exuberance have become strangely rare commodities. More Movies Read something that means something Try The New Yorker for only a dollar a week. Subscribe Now.

His work is brainless witless soulless and gutless. Its trite and rote and dull. Bay puts the ow in loud the sham in shameless and the bull in predictable. The movies are celluloid hemorrhoids. No worse Theyre celluloid Bon Jovi. A Michael Bay film in other words is much the opposite of the new Michael Bay film ""Pain amp; Gain"" a dizzying lowlife saga thats fast smart wicked sort of ambitious and blazingly ironic. Its as unpredictable as a Lindsay Lohan drive to the grocery store as overstuffed as the pictures on Anthony Weiners Twitter feed and as hilarious as me on the bench press. The movies set in Miami the grease trap of the continent way down where all the national crazy pools and festers. Or if Florida is Americas foot Miami is the gangrene-stricken toe. Mark Wahlberg is Daniel Lugo a personal trainer with three bad problems Hes dumb hes a sociopath and hes been to one of those hotel-ballroom self-help seminars. Lugo figures its his American right to get rich without deserving it. Wasnt he asks this land once a bunch of scrawny colonies that became ""the buffest most pumping country on the planet""? Together with his gym buddy Adrian (Anthony Mackie) who needs his money to fix his steroid-related impotence and an ex-con named Paul (Dwayne Johnson) who has turned to Christ and sobriety Lugo figures hell grab and torture the local scumbag zillionaire (Tony Shalhoub) until the rich guy signs away all his money and property. Then Lugoll move into the victims 3 million house and carry on as normal. ""I dont just want everything you have"" Lugo tells him. ""I want you not to have it"" Not a whole lot of this scheme goes off on schedule but guess what? The tycoon is such a jerk that nobody reports him missing. A few weeks later Lugo is living in his house. RELATED THE AWFUL AND TRUE STORY BEHIND PAIN amp; GAIN The police leap into inaction. They meet a guy half-dead in a hospital with a tire tread on his face and their response is ""And youre from Colombia?"" Thats cop for ""Not interested."" But Ed Harris. Hes a private detective. If anyone can fix Miami its this guy. If youre thinking ""GoodFellas"" on steroids or a much more ruthless ""Ruthless People"" youre onto something that Bay really hopes youre onto and -- zing bam -- the story is largely true. (Pete Collins 30000 word saga is on the Miami New Times site.) It could only have happened in a place like Miami a place where everybody -- the banks the real estate agents the cops -- is pouring kerosene on a bonfire of the inanities. Id say only Tom Wolfe could do it justice but Bays Miami is crazier and funnier than it was in Wolfes Miami book Asked if she thought there was anything odd about a guy buying a house with cash a broker shrugs. ""I thought maybe he was in sports rap you know hes black."" Bay is not only riffing like Scorsese (the internal monologues the camera gliding like its on ice skates ""Cant You Hear Me Knocking"") he does it with Quentin Tarantino flair. A shot of Wahlbergs feet bound up in surgical booties while exiting an elevator fits the plot seamlessly -- but its also a joke on ""The Departed."" Bay even spoofs the most hack-tacular Bay-ism with a shot of three guys confidently strolling away from a fireball -- a fireball that turns out to be a wet firecracker. Normally praising the script of a Bay movie is like telling Megan Fox she has pretty ears but Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have turned in a crackling pointed unbelievably dense screenplay that tops Tarantinos last one. It presses slightly too hard for significance with its musing on the American dream and the humor occasionally gets too broad but the wit pops like a Miami girls breast implants. Theres ""Youre a Jew right? I think I can help you."" Lugo says ""Ive watched a lot of movies. I know what Im doing."" Posing as a CIA agent he says ""These goggles theyre government issue. I guess in a way so am I."" I havent even gotten to the brilliance of the sets (dismal motels sun-wrecked pavement powder blue) or of Rebel Wilson as Adrians wife or of Ken Jeong as the motivational speaker. This movie is a knucklehead ""Great Gatsby."" I laughed my glutes off. Follow rkylesmith on Twitter for the latest movie news and reviews.

Photo Credit Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Three Miami bodybuilders with more brawn than brains stage a kidnapping that goes horribly awry. Based on a true story. Rated R (violence nudity language) BOTTOM LINE Grisly slapstick and freewheeling cruelty abound in this pitch-black comedy which can be quite funny until it isnt. CAST Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson Anthony Mackie LENGTH 210 Whats so funny about murder torture and dismemberment? Plenty in the right hands as the Coen Brothers proved with ""Fargo."" In the hands of Michael Bay the director of ""Pain amp; Gain"" however you may feel the grisly laughs sticking in your throat. Based on a 1999 series of articles in the Miami New Times ""Pain amp; Gain"" is a pitch-black comedy about two Miami bodybuilders Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) who hatch a plan Kidnap a rich guy torture him into signing away his assets then kill him. This is Lugos twisted version of Horatio Alger bootstrapping -- ""The way to improve yourself is to better yourself"" he says sagely -- while Doorbal is merely compensating for his steroid-shriveled manhood. Joining them is the hulking childlike ex-con Paul Doyle (a fictional role played by Dwayne Johnson).

Unfortunately their colossal biceps are matched only by their stupidity. Their victim deli owner Victor Kershaw (an excellent Tony Shalhoub) not only survives but begins tracking his captors via a private investigator Ed Du Bois (Ed Harris also narrating). Meanwhile the powerlifters choose a second victim. That plan goes even worse. Initially ""Pain amp; Gain"" is such a high-speed ride into the American heart of darkness (Ken Jeong plays Lugos favorite get-rich-quick guru) that all the beatings and skull crushings just seem like slapstick. Wahlbergs manic energy will keep you cranked up and Johnson is so endearing and deftly funny that he flat-out steals the movie. Its easily the best -- maybe the first? -- performance of his career. Ultimately though Bay -- whose ""Transformer"" movies seem like monuments to mindless consumerism -- may be the wrong choice for this cynical script (by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely). As the action grows rougher bloodier then downright ghastly Bay maintains a broad-humored wacky tone that begins to feel as some real-life victims and their kin have complained insensitive. ""Pain amp; Gain"" mostly laughs at its three dumb antiheroes. But that too has a cruelty all its own. 234 MoviesPain amp; Gain trailer PLOT Three Miami bodybuilders with more brawn than brains stage a kidnapping that goes horribly awry.

Michael Bay transforms to wizard of odd Michael Bay director of the blockbuster ""Transformers"" trilogy and other huge hits smiles when you tell him ""Pain amp; Gain"" -- his self-described ""small movie"" made on a budget of 26 million -- is one of the oddest films to come out of Hollywood in years. ""This is a weird movie"" the director says. ""This is not the kind of movie the studios greenlight much anymore. I wanted to do something small and quirky. But because Ive made Paramount billions of dollars with the Transformers movies I told them Im going to make this movie. They said Why do you want to make it? They were scared of it. But I saw something unique in this material."" ""Pain amp; Gain"" is different from anything Bay had directed before character-based and performance-driven with only one brief action sequence and a single rather puny explosion. advertisement | advertise on newsday Bay who is known for hyperkinetic editing still delivers the beautiful visuals but he holds on shots and characters faces for longer than two seconds giving you time to take them in.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) Photo credit Courtesy of Paramo This film image released by Paramount Pictures shows Tony Shalhoub in a scene from ""Pain and Gain."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) Michael Bay is one of the most distinctive directors in Hollywood -- and one of the most despised by film snobs. Since 1995s ""Bad Boys"" his incendiary action flicks have epitomized mindless entertainment for the young male demographic.Taking a break from playing with Transformers Bay has trimmed his usual budget for the bodybuilder comedy ""Pain amp; Gain"" which will sucker-punch both his critics and his audience. In telling a true story about hapless thugs who are the embodiment of Michael Bay fans the director has made the most fiendishly enjoyable movie of his career.Embracing the spirit of self-parody Mark Wahlberg is back in ""Boogie Nights""-mode as Daniel Lugo a dumb-but-ambitious personal trainer at a gym in Miami. Spouting catch-phrases from his self-help guru (Ken Jeong) Daniel concocts a scheme to pump up his bank account without breaking a sweat. He targets flabby customer Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) for a kidnapping and shakedown. Daniels dimwitted sidekicks are Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a hulking ex-convict who has traded booze for the Bible and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) a gym rat whose steroids habit has taken a toll on his virility.""Ive watched a lot of movies"" Daniel tells them. ""I know what Im doing.""The kidnapping is a comedy of errors as the blindfolded bigwig deduces the identity of his captors and preys on Pauls faltering faith. But soon the movie turns violent in a way thats more akin to ""Pulp Fiction"" than the popcorn flicks that Bay made with mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. And it gets ghastlier as it goes along necessitating an on-screen graphic in the last act to assure us that this is still a true story. The character-driven vehicle has a sardonically funny script (by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely the writers of ""Captain America"") to complement the run-and-gun visuals.In a rare role as a villain (albeit a sweet one) Johnson is a joy and along with Shalhoub the stellar supporting cast includes Ed Harris as a gruff detective investigating the case and Rebel Wilson as Adrians naughty nurse. As a deconstruction of the American dream ""Pain amp; Gain"" wont win any points for finesse but the satire packs plenty of muscle.What ""Pain amp; Gain""  Three stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 210  Content Bloody violence nudity sexuality strong language and drug use Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

RELATED NEWS Interview Tony Shalhoub talks Pain amp; Gain By Barbara VanDenburgh The Arizona Republic | azcentral.com Thu Apr 25 2013 957 AM Making a good black comedy is all about nailing tone. Its tricky work mining the worst of human nature for laughs without coming across as cruel or crass. When you think of masters of the form you think Stanley Kubrick. You think the Coen brothers. You probably dont think Michael Bay. ""Pain amp; Gain"" proves why. The film is a curious departure for Bay a veteran of the ""things blowing up real good"" school of fratboy filmmaking (""Bad Boys"" ""The Rock"" ""Transformers""). With a reported budget of 26 million -- a far cry from the hundreds of millions Bay commands for the ""Transformers"" movies -- ""Pain amp; Gain"" is at least in Bays universe darn near an indie film (case in point Only one car blows up). But you cant thread a needle this fine with a script filtered through Bays puerile id. What makes nailing the delicate tone even trickier is that ""Pain amp; Gain"" is based on the true story of a trio of weightlifters turned criminals. Mark Wahlberg stars as chief meathead Daniel Lugo a budding con artist and personal trainer at Sun Gym. Hes the sort of dope who idolizes the likes of ""Scarfaces"" Tony Montana and the Corleones self-made men who carve out their success in the world with machine-gun fire. He sees an easy way out of his mounting bills in one of his clients Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) an unctuous skeezeball with a healthy bankroll and a profitable Schlotzskys franchise. Lugo recruits two buddies to his cause. Theres Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) a fellow trainer desperate for cash to fix the erectile dysfunction brought out by his steroid abuse. And theres Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a fresh-from-prison born-again Christian whos having trouble adjusting to the real world. Together the men hatch a plan to rob Kershaw of his enviable life. Well ""plan"" is maybe too generous a word for kidnapping a guy torturing him into signing away his worldly possessions and then just expecting not to get caught. Theres a certain kinetic charm to the first half of the movie a freewheeling silliness to these outsized characters that makes you curious to see just how wrong things will go. But as the weightlifters plot spirals out of control so does the movies. It goes on far too long for one thing -- two-plus hours is a long time to spend trapped in a Bay movie where the script is the driving force. And that script starts to become downright uncomfortable as the tone unravels. Even Johnson who can be deeply entertaining as a coked-out Jesus-freak criminal (""Jesus Christ has blessed me with many gifts. One of them is knocking someone the (expletive) out"") gets a bit skin-crawly when in a moment of gay panic he beats the snot out of an elderly priest for overly admiring his pectoral muscles. With such a whacked-out tone its unclear whether the movie plays this out as a commentary on Johnsons character or just does it for yuks. Of course thats only one tasteless moment in a cesspool of tasteless moments. It gets to feel like the sort of movie a teen boy would make if you gave him tens of millions of dollars a boxful of Playboy magazines and a couple of cases of Red Bull complete with naked chicks dirty jokes rape jokes ninja costumes and slapstick and bathroom humor all seasoned with a soupcon of homophobia and misogyny. In other words its a Michael Bay movie. Reach the writer at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com.

Grade C If you ever yearned for a Three Stooges movie that played bone-crunching slapstick for real you might enjoy Michael Bays ""Pain amp; Gain"" a movie that tries to turn a torture chamber into a comedy club. Mark Wahlberg pumps himself up physically and histrionically to portray Danny Lugo the leader of an unholy trio of Miami gym rats. His followers are Anthony Mackie as Adrian Doorbal who would follow Lugo anywhere and Dwayne Johnson as Paul Doyle who believes at different times in Lugo Jesus AA and cocaine. When Lugo decides that being a manager and trainer at a ""muscle mecca"" called Sun Gym wont fulfill his American Dream he enlists fellow body-builders Doorbal and Doyle to help him kidnap a wealthy client Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub). Over the course of 30 days they pummel slash and fry him until he signs away his home his car his businesses and his bank accounts. It might seem daring for a filmmaker to treat this material comically - especially since its based on a true story as rendered in Pete Collins mind-blowing three-part series which ran in Miami New Times in 1999 (five years after the crimes). But Bay and his screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) adopt the coarsest possible strategy to court a ""Pulp Fiction"" audience. They turn Lugo Doorbal and Doyle into amiable lugs who end up swimming in gore because their ambition outstrips their talents. (Lugo and Doorbal are real characters; Doyle is a composite of several criminals.) They transform the actual torture victim the Argentinian-born Marc Schiller from a generous family man who mentored one of the gang and warned him about Lugo into ""Victor Kershaw"" (Shalhoub) an arrogant insulting and worse yet stereotypical Jewish businessman. Its as if they think theyre remaking O. Henrys ""Ransom of Red Chief"" about a kidnap victim who drives his captors crazy. When Kershaw cries out ""My son my son"" viewers are set up to scream with laughter since Kershaw has been presented as such a selfish jerk. It gets worse from there. ""Pain amp; Gain"" wants to be appallingly funny but mostly its just appalling. For a while the movie coasts along on its outrageous storyline. The screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely play to director Bays strengths - or maybe just cover for his weaknesses. Bay best known for the ""Transformers"" series has rarely been able to get to the heart of a scene rather than blow it up with spectacle. So the writers rely heavily on snappy voice-overs. Characters fill in the narrative blanks with first-person narration while Bay concentrates on slam-bam-splat and blood-laced punch lines. Too bad the script reduces its villains to one or two traits that grow absurd or monotonous. Lugo is supposed to hold the film together as a go-getter for the ""Go Go 90s"". Hes a sucker for motivational speakers like Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong) who divides the world into ""Doers"" and ""Dont-ers."" Wahlberg may have felt liberated playing a manic Doer but when hes frantic he looks as if hes flashing back to commercials by Cal Worthington  Crazy Eddie or Earl ""Madman"" Muntz. Lugo says the U.S. grew from 13 scrawny colonies to the buffest nation in the world. That statement is meant to expand the meaning of Lugos efforts to get ""big"" (muscular) ""hot"" (buff) and rich. The metaphor doesnt pass the sniff test in this sweaty movie which mostly tries to pass off exploitation as parody. When Michael Bay does a visual spoof of pole-dancers and strippers its like flipping through the erotic-club ads in the back of alternative weeklies. Mackies Doorbal swings between awestruck goon and steroid-wrecked lover. (Rebel Wilson wins some genuine laughs as the randy nurse who treats him for erectile dysfunction.) Johnson does get a chance to stretch as Doyle a one-man huddle of warring impulses. Its lowdown fun to see this would-be gentle giant suddenly erupt using a weight as a deadly discus in a prison-yard fight. But the films most promising comic idea - Doyles rapport with Kershaw - goes nowhere. Bay wants you to feel affection for Kershaw after he becomes a stubborn survivor. Even Shalhoub a terrific actor strains to make that happen. The one untarnished man is Ed Du Bois (Ed Harris) the private eye who cracked the Schiller/Kershaw case and urged Miami police to nab the villains before they struck again. Harris Du Bois is a straight shooter with a tasteful house and an understanding wife and he dresses in crisp blues and whites. Its almost as if hes the all-American rebuke to the messy grasping immigrants and minorities all around him. (The film doesnt make clear what Collins articles articulated that the man who laundered the gangs money John Mese owner of the Sun Gym was in the same social circle as Du Bois.) The media have been flooded with feature stories about Bay lauding him for this supposed change of pace (no giant robots) and for his unconventional camerawork. What nonsense. Bays idea of a beautiful shot is having electric bolts emanate from a taser in perfect symmetry with the sputum flooding from Kershaws mouth. Its hard to admire the virtuoso way the camera travels from Doorbals living room to his weight room where Lugo is murdering their next victim when the characters are so devalued. The filmmakers barely change this victims name Frank Griga a phone-sex entrepreneur of Hungarian descent becomes Frank ""Grin."" They portray Frank and his lover (also a victim) as crude nouveau riche. Then they have the nerve to put the real couples picture in the closing credits where they look svelte and elegant. Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd showed more affection for Central European immigrants when they did ""Two Wild and Crazy Guys.""

Comments click to enlarge Pain amp; Gain Video Rated R  129 minutes  2013 Michael Bay tries his hand at satire targeting the sort of hollow excess most of his movies epitomize. Based on true events it tells the story of three moronic Miami bodybuilders who kidnap a millionaire torture him for weeks steal his fortune and proceed to blow the money on drugs and shopping sprees. Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie are impressive as the criminals; their focused deadpan performances balance out the hyperactive direction making it tolerable for once. They also convey a sense of pathetic insecurity behind the characters cartoonish machismo with its rampant sexism sadism and homophobia. Bay is no Paul Verhoeven but hes coming from a similar place here purposely amplifying the ugliest qualities of American culture. With Ed Harris and Tony Shalhoub.

Best to leave such a feat in the nimbler hands of Quentin Tarantino the Coen brothers Guy Ritchie and Martin McDonagh.Bays Pain amp; Gain ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is a badly constructed blood-spattered caper that comes unglued early on.Known for the Transformers franchise and other vapid big-budget box office smashes like Armageddon Bay is not deft enough to pull off this movies darkly comic tone and bloody mayhem.STORY Dwayne Johnson Mark Wahlberg pumped for Pain amp; GainVIDEO Wahlberg strips off for Pain amp; GainIn the hands of a smart social satirist this story of greedy sleazeballs might have been a clever cautionary tale. Or simply funny. Instead its crass overlong and chaotic.While the story starts with some promise and a couple of good jokes Pain never attains edgy comedy status. Its not the fault of the actors an impressive ensemble headed by the engaging Dwayne Johnson. Putting Tony Shalhoub Ed Harris Rebel Wilsonand Rob Corddry in the same movie is an inspired notion.But flashes of humor fade away before the halfway mark and then the whole enterprise goes off the rails crashes and burns.The story of a trio of larcenous bodybuilders is set in Miami in 1995 and is based on a bizarre real-life crime. Fueled by steroids and cocaine these guys have an exceptionally clumsy way with criminality. Mark Wahlberg plays ringleader Daniel Lugo who convinces his musclebound pals Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) and Paul Doyle (Johnson) to aid and abet a get-rich-quick scheme. It entails the kidnapping and extortion of Victor Kershaw (Shalhoub) a wealthy businessman whom Lugo trains at the gym. After abducting Kershaw Lugo expects him to calmly hand over all of his worldly assets. Fat chance. When Kershaw resists Lugo and his chiseled cohorts turn to torture.Johnsons Doyle is an ex-con whos found religion. Before hooking up with Lugo and Doorbal he had tried to go legit. The tug-of-war between Doyles flaring temper massive strength and Christian values makes for the films best performance. But its not enough to save this muddled misogynistic mess.Wahlbergs Lugo is buff egotistical and swayed by the psycho-babble of lame-brained motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong). ""Dont be a dont-er Wu exhorts. ""Do be a doer.Shalhoubs Kershaw is a tenacious guy who refuses to go down without a fight. Then he disappears from the movie for a long stretch -- but not for plot-related reasons. Bay takes a wrong-headed turn down seedy side roads marked by gratuitous violence with some especially malicious nastiness aimed at women. The buff triad smash a guys head with a barbell feed a dog a severed human toe murder a woman with animal tranquilizer and run over someone after setting him on fire. Thats just scratching the gruesome surface.The films narration is problematic awkwardly shifting between key players and thwarting any sense of perspective.What might have been a viable stranger-than-fiction tale is undone by ham-fisted execution numbingly brutal energy and dim wit. It all makes for plenty of pain and no cinematic gain. 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/11P2y1R",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/zsrlXq27M0I/?utm_source=feedly,200,painandgain33,painandgain,usatoday
"Pain amp; Gain movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Bodybuilders build their body count in Pain amp; Gain  1/2 Pain amp; Gain Anthony Mackie Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson star in ""Pain amp; Gain."" Anthony Mackie Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson star in ""Pain amp; Gain."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In America youre either a ""doer"" or a ""dont-er."" So says the hostile motivational speaker played by Ken Jeong one of several supporting sleazebags tipping around the edges of director Michael Bays ""Pain amp; Gain.""What the self-help guru is selling bodybuilder and gym manager Danny Lugo played by Mark Wahlberg is buying with a vengeance. The movie based on the true story of a truly stupid group of pumped-up kidnappers and killers wallows in steroidally jacked style and excess. Everything is supersaturated in flaming pastels or hot rich neon. The images are packed with glistening muscle and bright shiny superslow-motion struts toward the camera with something in flames as a backdrop. Its Bay World. And after an hour of ""Pain amp; Gain"" it felt more like ""Pain amp; Pain."" The storys milieu of Miami bodybuilders low-level miscreants and assorted human barnacles may be something different for the man behind the ""Bad Boys"" larks ""Pearl Harbor"" ""Armageddon"" and the ""Transformers"" trilogy. But Bays comedies are funnier when theyre funny by accident.This couldve been a great black comedy. The script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely throws in every severed digit smashed skull and snorted line of cocaine the writers were required to leave out of their ""Chronicles of Narnia"" screenplays. ""Pain amp; Gain"" derives from a three-part 1999-2000 Miami New Times series of nonfiction articles by Pete Collins. In 1994 Lugo and his hapless colleagues targeted a Sun Gym client for kidnapping and extortion. He was tortured then crushed by a vehicle and left for dead. But he didnt die. Others did later but not him. The film takes the usual number of moviemaking liberties. Dwayne Johnson bulls his way through the role of recovering cocaine addict and alcoholic ex-con alongside Anthony Mackies gullible personal trainer. Lugos kidnapping victim (fictionalized for the script) is a Columbian-American businessman (Tony Shaloub) a smug insulting specimen identified in glaring close-up by the Star of David necklace around his greedy neck. (Nobody except for Ed Harris wily detective comes off well in ""Pain amp; Gain"" but still.)I laughed -- once -- when in one of Bays many freeze-frames Mackies character is captured with a look of comical horror on his face at the latest unfortunate event in these criminals endeavors. Elsewhere the jokes curdle. Bays touch is like granite. The look and nasty insincere vibe of the picture carries the assurance of every Bay project. Ill give it that.Cinematographer Ben Seresin shoots digitally as well as on film and the changing stocks and whirling perspectives may not be consistent but thats the idea Theres always something some grabby flourish or two-second shift in angle to divert you from story or character. Composer Steve Jablonskys music may as well be scoring ""Bad Boys 3"" or ""Armageddon 2 Armageddon Outta Here"" so heavy-spirited is its ambient mood.Bay doesnt have the facility or the interest or frankly the moral filmmaking intelligence for real social satire. His idea of funny is a rump-level shot of a stripper getting out of a pool followed by an abrupt cut to an obese womans thighs just as an off-screen character mutters the word ""repulsive."" mjphillipstribune.comPain amp; Gain -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for bloody violence crude sexual content nudity language throughout and drug use)Running time 209Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Kidnapping Bodybuilding Sports Transformers (movie) Mark Wahlberg Ken Jeong Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Michael Bay is spinning his new dark comedy Pain amp; Gain as a lower-budget personal project a character piece that allows him to satisfy his fanciful muse before returning to less spiritually fulfilling endeavors. But dont expect Sundance fodder from the man who previously blessed the world with Pearl Harbor Armageddon and other clattering cinematic migraines. Bays idea of ""small"" and ""personal"" is making a film not about giant robots--the stars of his Transformers trilogy--but manly men with the physiques and dimensions of giant robots. Set in sun-baked steroid-addled 90s Florida Pain amp; Gain buffs up an ostensibly true story of greed and ruthless ambition into a comic-book macho fantasy of upward mobility gone awry. Any pretensions of satire moral ambiguity or social commentary get lost in a hurricane of empty mindless spectacle. Mark Wahlbergs epic winning streak ends with the thankless lead role of a hotshot morally slippery personal trainer who decides to take control of his life and his finances by kidnapping torturing and then seizing the assets of a rich gaudy Jewish businessman (Tony Shalhoub). Often-unhelpful assistance arrives in the form of fellow gym freak Anthony Mackie and ex-con Dwayne Johnson who clings to sobriety and faith as the cornerstones of a tough life. Due in no small part to the stupidity of the conspirators the plot does not go according to plan. But that doesnt keep the overmatched crooks from plunging further and further into a world of criminality from which they struggle to emerge with their lives or freedom intact. Pain amp; Gain has one huge asset (literally) in the underrated Johnson who lends his spiritual-struggler a sincere poignant conviction (before he falls off the wagon) and a go-for-broke desperation (after he loses his spiritual center and embraces cocaine with the same intensity he once embraced Jesus purifying love). The squirmy humanity of Johnsons performance stands in sharp contrast to the gratingly excessive visual style; Bay manages to recreate the overbearing and frenetic qualities of his usual fare but at a fraction of the budget. Pain amp; Gain is less a satire of stupidity than a loud brash unapologetically vulgar celebration of aggression divorced from intellect. Its the film Wahlberg and John C. Reillys characters in Boogie Nights would have written as a vehicle for themselves in a coked-up narcissistic delirium fatally unaware that the narrative makes them look like oblivious dim-witted assholes not the swaggering Tony Montana-like badasses of their pop-culture-warped imaginations.

"Pain amp; Gain (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pain amp; Gain (R) Uneasy humor from the Three Stooges on steroids Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson star in Pain amp; Gain. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/24/2013 Editor rating 3 You cant quite call Pain amp; Gain director Michael Bays adaptation of a series of news articles by Pete Collins recounting a horrific Miami crime a comedy. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely dont treat the story frivolously On the page the movie probably didnt read funny at all. But there is a considerable amount of humor in Pain amp; Gain anyway because Bay has ingeniously cast his three lead character (lunk-headed bodybuilders on a crime spree that would make the Three Stooges seem smart) with likable actors who play the material straight. When you laugh during Pain amp; Gain youre laughing at their astonishing stupidity and complete lack of self-awareness. These were men who thought of themselves as gods -- goons who believed that because of their physical strength they could take whatever they wanted from people and somehow never be held accountable. Their obliviousness is astounding. Pain amp; Gain is the third movie Bay has filmed in Miami. He once again makes the city look like a paradise but this time with a dark underbelly filled with shady criminals. The director has also slowed down his editing rhythms to allow us to focus on the characters. Yes there is the obligatory shot of characters walking away from a fireball but its a pretty small explosion and aside from a brief action sequence the movie is character-driven. Who would have thought Bay had that in him? Although the movie is a change of pace for Bay his sledgehammer politically incorrect approach remains intact. There are homophobic swipes sexist gags and racist caricatures (Ken Jeong plays a motivational speaker). Pain amp; Gain is not a movie for the squeamish or the easily offended. But theres no meanness behind the jokes because youre laughing at the stupidity of the people who say them not the slurs themselves. The film simplifies what was a complicated case. Wahlberg who plays ringleader Daniel Lugo lures two others -- Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a composite of several others in the case and Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) -- to join him in his plan to kidnap a wealthy businessman (Tony Shalhoub) and hold him hostage in a warehouse torturing him until he finally signed over his home and bank accounts. Lugos argument is that they all deserved to enjoy the American Dream so why not take it from others? Their spree might have ended there -- Doorbal even married a woman (Rebel Wilson) and began leading a domestic life -- if Doyle hadnt squandered his share of the loot on cocaine and desperately hatched another plan to steal money. Pain amp; Gain is an unusual genre-defying movie -- this is at heart a crime drama but told through the prism of absurdist humor -- and the story gets so wild including a dim-bulb stripper who believes shes working for the CIA that a title card flashes late in the film to remind you ""This is still a true story."" The movie follows the case to its end and with the exception of Ed Harris as a detective who becomes intrigued by the case and Johnson whose innate likability helps keep you engaged practically all the nonvictim characters are detestable. This is easily Bays best movie the work of a filmmaker with a cracked sense of humor that he is able to share with the audience. A long scene in which the roided-out gang tries to murder a hostage and fails repeatedly recalls a scene in Alfred Hitchcocks Torn Curtain in which Paul Newman and Julie Andrews discover how hard it is to kill a man. The difference is that Hitchcock played the scene for suspense Pain amp; Gain plays it for uneasy laughs.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) Previous Next This undated publicity photo released by Paramount Pictures shows from left Dwayne Johnson as Paul Doyle Tony Shalhoub as Victor Kershaw and Mark Wahlberg as Daniel Lugo in the film ""Pain and Gain"" directed by Michael Bay from Paramount Pictures. The film releases in theaters April 26 2013. (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) Theres a siege mentality about Michael Bays movies as though viewers are the enemy holed up in a bunker and hes the guy ordering heavy-metal music around-the-clock to wear down our morale and force us to surrender.Bays true-crime caper ""Pain amp; Gain"" lacks the visual-effects mayhem and sci-fi cacophony of his ""Transformers"" blockbusters yet the movie uses all the shock and awe and noise and bluster the director has in his utterly unsubtle arsenal.Unlike Bays usual action nonsense theres a story screenplay characters and wry mix of suspense and pitiable comedy to be had in the tale of three Florida bodybuilders who blunder through kidnapping schemes like the Three Stooges on steroids.All but the faintest flashes of humanity and pathos are flattened by the cinematic cyclone that is Michael Bay. He drowns ""Pain amp; Gain"" in gimmick and style which rather than gussying things up dresses them down to make the movie even more ugly and sordid than it is on paper.That these three guys played by Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie are boobs and imbeciles we get it from their actions. That what they do is reprehensible thats clear to see. That the world as they view it is twisted and coarse another given.So why cant Bay set aside a few visual tricks and give us an occasional breather from the overload on screen? ""Pain amp; Gain"" is a two-hour onslaught of dizzy drunken cuts hot bodies in empty poises shifting perspectives (with a babble of alternating character voice-overs to accompany) and often sickening images.Example Bay puts all of his technical know-how into a remarkably constructed shot of Tony Shalhoub as the bodybuilders first victim spewing spit as hes Tasered. Its done in agonizing slow-motion and extreme close-up huge bubbles of saliva erupting from Shalhoubs mouth.An impressive bit of technical work thats just disgusting and unpleasant to watch. Despite the sheen of Bays imagery everything about ""Pain amp; Gain"" looks filthy and diseased.Likewise Wahlberg so boyishly charming as another stunted man-child in last summers ""Ted"" shows nothing but grubbiness as Daniel Lugo the dimwitted mastermind of this plot carried out around Miami in the mid-1990s.An ignoramus awash in envy toward the rich people he trains at a gym Lugo enlists disciple Adrian Doorbal (Mackie) and born-again ex-con Paul Drake (Johnson) to kidnap self-made millionaire Victor Kershaw (Shalhoub) and torture him to extort everything hes got.The dumbfounding farce of how these guys screw things up should be entertainment enough all on its own. Some of that still comes through in the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely though most of the comedy is smothered by the dazzle Bay cant resist.Johnson comes off best among the three bad guys clearly relishing his beta-stooge role as Curly to Wahlbergs Moe that frees him up for some goofy unmanly hijinks.Shalhoub rises above the chaos with razor ferocity to show yet again that hes one of Hollywoods finest character actors. Ed Harris adds the movies only notes of grace and class as a detective on the case while Rebel Wilson has scene-stealing moments that feel wonderfully improvised as Doorbals kooky wife.But those few highlights are incinerated in the bonfires Bay sets on-screen.You dont expect a real-life story as nasty as this to be a pretty fairy tale. The details are so absurdly tragic though that ""Pain amp; Gain"" could have been a very entertaining romp through the American dream as reflected in a funhouse mirror.Instead its a lesson in high-gloss odiousness refracted through the frenzied look-what-I-can-do lens of Michael Bay. Bring on Wahlberg in the next ""Transformers."" Theres bound to be more gain and less pain when Bays buffed-up behemoths are giant robots.""Pain amp; Gain"" a Paramount release is rated R for bloody violence crude sexual content nudity language throughout and drug use.

For the better part of the past two decades Hollywoods poster boy for macho mayhem shiny military hardware and razzle-dazzle spectacle has come across as a slightly joyless filmmaker. His big-budget popcorn productions like Armageddon Pearl Harbor and the Transformers films have always strained to give audiences an excess of bang for their buck but you never got the sense that he could tell a joke. If anything Bay seemed like the type of guy who was incapable of figuring out whether audiences were laughing with him or at him. But with Pain amp; Gain his surprising true-crime comedy Bay has finally decided to lighten up a bit. Based on the stranger-than-fiction saga of the Sun Gym Gang first reported by Pete Collins in a series of 1999 articles in the Miami New Times Pain amp; Gain is the surreal story of three dim-bulb Florida gym rats who stop blasting their quads long enough to hatch a scheme to kidnap and shake down one of their wealthy personal-training clients (the wonderfully surly Tony Shalhoub). The ringleader of this juiced-up caper is Mark Wahlbergs Daniel Lugo an ambitious bodybuilder who sees his ripped physique as his own personal expression of the American dream made flesh. Its the kind of character thats right in Wahlbergs wheelhouse. Daniel is essentially who Dirk Diggler would have become had he given up porn chugged a few protein shakes and moved to Miami-Dade County. Youd have to be a moron to buy anything that the delusional dreamer has to sell but this is Miami in the 90s. Anything sounds plausible if youve got enough cocaine coursing through your bulging veins. Daniel finds a couple of willing thick-necked co-conspirators in his fellow trainer Adrian (Anthony Mackie who actually manages to make shriveled-testicle and erectile-dysfunction jokes funny) and the Jesus-freak ex-con Paul (a fast and loose Dwayne Johnson). Together they plot a lamebrain caper which quickly backfires thanks to a string of idiotically bad decisions. Initially their Keystone Kops-on-creatine act is hilarious and Bay seems liberated by the larky lightness of the film. Dont get me wrong hes still Michael Bay -- he doesnt waste any opportunity to show a close-up of some bikini-clad babes thong-cleaved derriere -- but this smart scaled-down new direction feels fresher than his usual cocktail of fireballs and bombast. The film written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is cleverly told from shifting points of view so that we get voice-overs from each of the characters recounting what absurd turn of events happened next. Even they cant seem to believe their own stupidity. For the first half of the film which has a fizzy kicky caffeinated energy this works beautifully. But as with the steroids and blow that fuel the film the high eventually subsides and it goes on for at least a half hour too long. Pain amp; Gain proves once and for all that Michael Bay can set up a punchline. Now all he needs is an editor.

Doesnt America promise riches and luxury to people who deserve them? Hes worked hard to build his body into a hulking knot of muscles; success should follow. But Lugo--the lead in Michael Bays neon-noir ode to Miami muscle tone and the modern American dream--is stuck as an underpaid personal trainer at Miami Lakes Sun Gym where he boosts the confidence of customers far less chiseled than he and dreams of a better (read richer) life.Inspired to be a ""doer"" after a seminar featuring inspirational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong) Lugo turns his newfound patriotic zeal into action. He rounds up two accomplices fellow body-obsessed gym buddy Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) whose steroid use has ""messed [him] up down there"" and recently released convict Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) a mountain of man who found Jesus and sobriety in lockup but still harbors a pesky violent streak. Together they plot to kidnap Lugos rich and ever-sneering Colombian client Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) and torture him until he gives them everything he owns his swanky mansion successful deli bright orange speedboat the works.Bays film is based on and mostly faithful to the eponymous true story penned by Pete Collins for the Miami New Times in late 1999. The Sun Gym Gang isnt made up of professional mobsters. Theyre musclebound egotists with a sense of importance more inflated than their steroid-pumped pecs and Bay wastes no opportunity for laughs at their expense. They bungle the Kershaw operation in a series of screwups that make the buddy cops in Bad Boys their predecessors in the Bay movie oeuvre look James Bond-suave. Dressed in military fatigues they show up at Kershaws home expecting to catch him alone; hes hosting a Seder. They target a car at a shopping center but its the wrong one and Kershaw drives away unaware.Those might sound like juvenile sitcom-style capers but as Bay reminds his audience at the films beginning and again later on they were real events--real being a relative term in Miami. For moviegoers whose disbelief is still sore from being suspended so high above Bays earlier CGI-heavy festivals of eye candy like Transformers the ""true story"" label keeps the focus on how fun it is to watch these guys.And the Sun Gym dudes are fun to watch especially when they finally acquire Kershaws money and their own grasp on reality spins out of control. Johnson as the most timid and complex of the three characters portrays a relapsing Doyle with both sympathy and humor. Mackie does his best with the scripts dick jokes. (Doorbal blows all of his new cash on erectile-dysfunction treatment.) When Lugo straight-facedly convinces his dimwitted stripper girlfriend Sorina Luminita (Bar Paly) that hes a CIA agent the scene is so funny you forget what a recklessly sexist ""dumb blond"" character Sorina is. (Hey shes based on a real woman.)Meanwhile private investigator Ed Du Bois (Ed Harris) and Kershaw stake out the gang to try to persuade Miami police to take their tale seriously. What the cops dont believe sadistic beefcakes in wacky disguises kidnapped a Colombian and nearly beat him to death with dildos over something other than drugs?Its easy to see why Miami police brush them off The story is unbelievable. During one particularly absurd chase scene Bay stops the action to remind viewers that ""this is still a true story."" Perhaps thats why the director was so drawn to this project so committed to telling the Sun Gym Gang saga on the big screen that he agreed to direct another Transformers cash cow in return for Paramount Pictures financial backing. Maybe he wanted to show his critics theyre wrong that crazy action-movie schemes with explosions and car chases arent just the stuff of flashy summer flicks--that they exist in real life too.Though this story needs no embellishment Bay cant help himself. He adds wild sidebars and shoot-outs to the already-insane material. At one point a character feeds his own severed toe to a chihuahua. Bay injects slo-mo effects Instagram-esque freeze-frames and B-movie-style gore. (Those who remember the Sun Gym Gangs murdered victims probably wont appreciate seeing one of their heads explode like a pumpkin beneath a falling barbell weight.) These cheap tricks work like movie steroids unnaturally inflating the appearance of whats happening onscreen--and diminishing its overall uh potency.When the story runs off the rails and crashes headfirst into a too-perfect ending its because Bay was led astray by the same things that got the Sun Gym Gang into this mess in the first place superficiality ambition and the belief that reality just isnt good enough.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Ciara LaVelle Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Daily Edition Login to download Pain amp; Gain Film Review 600 PM PDT 4/22/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Michael Bay so-called low-budget true-life comic crime caper is all overkill. TWITTER Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson star in Michael Bays true-crime actioner about Miami body builders. Dim-witted bottom-feeders on steroids and coke run amok seeking the American dream in Pain amp; Gain a ham-fisted thick-skulled comic caper about bodybuilders-turned-criminals which like its three protagonists fully lives down to its own potential. Intentionally made on the cheap (for 25 million) thanks to its stars taking back-end deals this is director Michael Bays idea of a low-budget indie-style film even though the muscles and ammo on view here are only slightly less imposing than those of his Transformers films. Although ostensibly intending to send up characters and a milieu that are crass and vulgar the film itself shares their affinities to such an extent that this distinction will be lost on audiences whose own lifestyles or aspirations lie in the same general direction. The result will be some muscular box office with the masses perhaps especially from some overseas markets where the macho allure will combine with a perverse fascination with the depraved way of American life herein revealed. PHOTOS 7 Music to Movie Directors Michael Bay David Fincher Spike Jonze ""Unfortunately this is a true story"" the narration brightly begins. Equally unfortunately however the story is told in a hammer-on-anvil manner that evinces no gift for social satire or sharp cultural insight. Such central topics as the sexually diminishing properties of muscle supplements the destructive effects of drugs and the stupidity of ramped-up violence will exert their base appeal on a certain public as will the fact that nearly every woman here is a hooker and/or a stripper or at least behaves like it; swamps any meager critique of the world it pretends to expose. The opportunistic lowlifes at the center of things could scarcely be more misguided and can only be made vaguely appetizing by virtue of movie star appeal. Adapted from some magazines articles by the screenwriting team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who wrote all three Chronicles of Narnia entries both Captain Americas and Thor The Dark World the script focuses on three guys who are as muscularly developed as they are morally and ethically deprived. The ringleader is Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) a glib personal trainer at Miamis Sun Gym a ""muscle mecca"" for the mid-1990s South Beach crowd a hustler who has far too seriously transformed his workout ethic into a philosophy of life and now dedicates himself to becoming a ""doer"" so he can live the great life enjoyed by some of his scuzzy but gold-garlanded clients. PHOTOS 26 of Hollywoods Most Popular Athletes-Turned-Actors Concocting a scheme to kidnap and extort filthy rich wiseguy Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) Daniel recruits two losers dimmer than he is fellow gym cohort Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) whose defining character trait is privates shrunken to microscopic uselessness by an excess of roids and ex-con Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) whose embrace of Jesus and clean living is a tenuous thing. It takes them three tries to pull off the kidnapping. Then even after all manner of unpleasant and clumsy torture Kershaw proves to be such a combative and resilient captive that he holds out for weeks; nothing can completely break this guy or when the time comes even kill him. This s.o.b.s obstinate survival is supposed to be very funny (and might have been moreso had the originally cast Albert Brooks remained with the project) but one of the few bits that actually does prove amusing is the spectacle of the three lethal knuckleheads high out of their minds presiding over a neighborhood watch meeting once theyve moved into posh digs with their ill-gotten gains. With the regular Dade County police shown as self-confessed incompetents it falls to retired cop Ed Du Bos (Ed Harris) to chase down (as well as his aging body can mange it) the pumped up miscreants who now that theyve burned through one mans fortune set their sights on another local moneybags porn king Frank Grin (Michael Rispoli very amusing). With a combination of misguided greed foolishness and sense of their own imperviousness the boys this time seriously overplay their hand setting themselves up for a trip to death row where two of them remain today. VIDEO Pain amp; Gain Trailer Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson Favor Fast Cars and Tasers Part of the reason for the films overlength at 129 minutes is the ill-judged indulgence of climactic would-be humorous scenes of the lunkheads cleaning up and disposing of the grisly remains of two unnecessary victims their incompetence at which helps seal their fates. By this time we know these guys are losers and are going down and Bays skills at slapstick and slow-burn comedy are sufficiently undeveloped to have served as a warning to curtail this interlude. Wahlbergs Lugo is the highly toxic sun god around which all the subservient characters orbit at their own peril and it cant be said that the actor doesnt give it his all. Seriously pumped up hes a huckster and motivator and painfully unaware self-believer who talks the sort of game that takes in people with no self-esteem and no lives. More touching in a weird way is Johnsons Doyle a simpleton whos all muscle and no I.Q. whose prison-born religious fervor perhaps does offer him his some hope but whos such a softy he quite like Lennie in Of Mice and Men can be manipulated into doing anything by Lugo. Unfortunately Johnsons carefully cultivated highly likable and capable image doesnt square at all with this character so that seeing him surrounded by a roomful of giant dildos and being persuaded to kill doesnt sit well at all. Mackies Doorbal is a fairly thankless part good for a couple of cheap laughs although the ever-welcome Rebel Wilson as his forgiving plus-size girlfriend delivers some nicely underplayed humor. The omnipresent Ken Jeong punches up his brief role as a brash motivational speaker. As usual with Bay the visual and aural style is as over-hydrauliced as the events of display resulting in an inevitable feeling of overkill.

Suggesting ""Fargo"" by way of the Three Stooges Bays latest certainly proves that the ""Transformers"" auteur does have something more than jacked-up robots on his mind specifically jacked-up muscle men who will stop at nothing to achieve their deeply twisted notion of the American dream. With a very fine ensemble cast recruited to play an array of overtly despicable characters this unapologetically vulgar sometimes quite funny often stomach-churning bacchanal will surely prove too extreme for great swathes of the multiplex crowd. But the marquee value of topliners Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson plus the pics reportedly modest 25 million pricetag spells more gain than pain for Paramounts box office pecs. Given that every Bay film is something of a stamina test marked by passages of intense exhilaration and paralyzing fatigue with ""Pain amp; Gain"" the director may have lucked into the most fitting subject matter of his career the world of obsessive bodybuilders and the trainers who push them beyond the brink of exhaustion. Adapted by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""Captain America The First Avenger"" the ""Narnia"" trilogy) from a series of articles originally published in the Miami New Times by Pete Collins the film tells of one such muscle mecca Miamis Sun Gym where staff and clientele include a liberal mixture of strippers ex-cons and small-time scam artists. One such hustler is Sun Gym manager Danny Lugo (Wahlberg) who in the fall of 1994 decides to abduct one of his clients wealthy Colombian-American businessman Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub) -- and defraud him of his net worth. To aid in the scheme Lugo recruits two accomplices personal trainer Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and former Attica inmate Paul (Johnson) a recovering alcoholic and junkie who found Jesus during his last stint in the slammer. After a couple of near-misses (in real life there were several more) the trio -- decked out in ridiculous Halloween costumes -- succeed in nabbing their mark who they sequester in an abandoned dry-cleaning plant and over the next 30 days force to sign over all of his worldly assets including cars a local deli franchise and a gaudy McMansion in a posh gated community. In Collins reporting the story of the Sun Gym gang reads like an inordinately malicious bid for the good life by a bunch of overcompensating he-men whose musculature vastly outpaced their intellect -- their staggering incompetence rivaled only by that of the Miami-Dade Police who when Kershaw (in reality Marc Schiller) miraculously survived to tell his tale initially refused to believe him. While sticking largely to the facts Bay and the writers are clearly aiming for something bigger a commentary on American self-entitlement and to an extent the very sort of ra-ra macho posturing Bay has proffered without irony in many previous films. In contrast to the unconscionable thug he seems to be on the page the movies Lugo is more of a harebrained dreamer who sees himself as one of lifes ""doers"" high on self-help mantras and a sense of his own inviolability. Wahlbergs deft performance which plays on his innate likability to conceal his characters ultimate menace (a side of the actor little seen onscreen since his fine turn as the psycho boyfriend in James Foleys ""Fear"") is one of the films (few) unqualified pleasures. But the movies cynical subtext and whatever Bay is ultimately hoping to say with it remain mostly undeveloped. To its credit ""Pain amp; Gain"" never succumbs to glamorizing its characters or their crimes keeping things rooted in a constant grim tension. For all its absurdist accents the long middle section in which Kershaw is beaten and bludgeoned by means that wouldnt have seemed out of place in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is punishing to behold and dilutes much of the frantic energy the movie has built up during its opening act. And at 129 minutes theres much more to come including severed digits penile injections a spinning weight plate to the neck and in one unforgettable extreme-close-up a cargo vans rear tire backing up over a human face. At his best particularly in the two ""Bad Boys"" movies Bay can be a master of exuberant chaos but here the violence mostly lands with a sickening thud which is fitting one supposes but also ultimately numbing. For better or worse -- arguably both -- Bay remains one of the most distinctive visual stylists at work in American movies today and ""Pain amp; Gain"" is nothing if not an orgy of swooshing swooping movements super slo-mo blazing pastels (for the exteriors) and glowing neon (for the interiors) all captured on an array of pro and prosumer cameras both film and digital that give the movie a luxurious array of visual textures. Bay who previously shot Miami very well in his two ""Bad Boys"" movies here turns it into a shimmering oasis of sin. One image glimpsed late in the film even feels like its makers entire career condensed into a single shot wads of 100 bills laid out on a UV tanning bed. The pics home stretch gets a welcome boost from veteran Bay player Ed Harris as the seasoned private eye who ended up blowing the lid off the Sun Gym case. Hes only around for a few scenes but he slips into them with such masterly ease that the character seems fuller and richer than many with double the screen time. Women unsurprisingly are mostly expendable here reduced to sex objects and convenient surfaces for snorting coke though the resourceful Rebel Wilson manages to steal a few scenes as Adrians clueless nurse girlfriend.

Lynn Green says May 9 2013 at 839 am Saw the 48 Hours coverage of the true story (4/19/13). Movie followed the true story very well. Though you had to remember it was based on truth ( and the movie reminds audiences of that ) all 5 of us thought it was great and LOL. There is humor in real life even in stupid criminals. The actual events already happened and you cant change them. Engage your sense of humor See the movie Reply R. Daniel Stephens says May 8 2013 at 203 pm An incredibly disappointing movie since I am a big fan of the director and actors plus being a former South Florida resident and from the bodybuilding lifestyle. I dont care if this is based on a true story this movie was gross. The story was a flat non funny flop with gut wrenching ridiculous feats of stupidity bad scene sequences and poor dialog. The actors were great and the director excellent but the screenwriting got lost with the facts. The whole movie missed. My gut was hurting from seeing this and thinking I paid for it Reply Mike Prasad says April 24 2013 at 205 pm The real Adrian Doorbal was an Indo-Carribean(Trinidadian of indian descent) male that had a carribean accent. I dont understand why they didnt cast someone like Kal Penn or Naveen Andrews to play the role? Is it Hollywood not wanting to cast an Indian in a major role as a villain? Most of the time ive seen Indians typecast as taxi driversIT workers and Deli owners...usually harmless roles. This could have been a perfect example of breaking the typecast. Reply LOL says April 24 2013 at 1236 pm Leave these journalists alone. They have to turn around these reviews at breakneck speed. Reply JUMP says April 22 2013 at 826 pm Who cares they all look alike.
