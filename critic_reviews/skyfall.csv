A Bond film is supposed to deliver mayhem and eye candy in exotic locales; Skyfall offers memorable set pieces in Shanghai Scotland and an abandoned island factory compound. A Bond film needs gadgets; Skyfall knowingly gives us a personalized Walther and a radio transmitter. (Honoring the brand but not indulging it.) A Bond film should feature a menacing villain whos also just a touch daffy; Javier Bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come-hither leer. But most of all a Bond film needs a proper Englishman who can do his bit for crown and country while dazzling the ladies and wearing a tuxedo like its a second skin. Here and there Daniel Craig manages the trick but too often he comes off like a canny street tough a musclebound Steve McQueen with a posh accent. Along the way his boss M notes that ""orphans always make the best agents"" but that shouldnt mean they get to skip out on charm school. (Craigs delivery on the trademark Bond banter labors harder than the seams on his trousers which is saying something.) But its not all his fault hes not the one who blends Mother and the Mother Country in a story that takes much too long to say much too little beyond ""Spies -- like the one in this old-timey franchise -- are still relevant"" With Judi Dench Ralph Fiennes. 2012. -- Matthew Lickona Related links ""James Bond brand whore""  November 29 2012 ""A closer look at the posters for Skyfall and Lincoln""  October 29 2012 ""A closer look at the trailer for Skyfall""  September 19 2012 This movie is not currently in theaters.

In fact overly calculated visuals are about all thats on the menu. The personal style of our hero once the essence of a Bond film barely peeks through. Even the Bond theme music is all but gone save for a brief moment thats no more than a nod to a distant and nearly forgotten past. With Daniel Craig as our unsmiling brooding Bond were about as far from Diamonds Are Forever as its possible to get; that is its Bond without the fun; that is its Bond for those who dont realize that the whole thing is a spoof.

He even considers early retirement plunging to his apparent doom after hes shot in the movies thunderously exciting pre-credit sequence. Spoiler alert 007 survives to fight another day but not until hes treated himself to an unofficial sabbatical an opportunity for recuperation and introspection. Not that anyone goes to a Bond movie for navel-gazing but theres definitely a more serious undercurrent this time around a certain hankering after relevance that must surely be attributed to the presence of Academy Award-winning director Sam Mendes. No disrespect to Michael Apted Lee Tamahori and the rest but Mendes represents a step up in pedigree for a franchise thats usually been the preserve of action specialists. Photos Becoming James BondMendes is out to make more than just another Bond film that much is clear. ""Skyfall"" features all the usual elements -- the chases the girls the arch villain -- but recalibrated with intelligence and a less smug more searching sensibility. You might even detect a hint of Lester Burnham the disenchanted depressed 50-something played by Kevin Spacey in Mendes ""American Beauty"" in the disaffected and mildly disabled Bond played by Daniel Craig this time out.

But M (Judi Dench) knows hes still the man for the job even if her latest government overseer (Ralph Fiennes) seems to think theyre both relics headed for the scrapyard. Scripted by Bond specialists Neal Purvis and Robert Wade this time with a significant assist from John Logan (""Hugo""; ""The Aviator"") ""Skyfall"" cobbles together bits and pieces from many another thriller sometimes more loosely than we might like and draws in particular from ""The Dark Knight"" -- but for my money Mendes gets the balance between light and dark more nearly right than Christopher Nolan managed in this years most overbearing blockbuster. This is a movie of gleaming surfaces -- veteran DP Roger Deakins turns a glass skyscraper at night into a funhouse hall of mirrors and a floating Macau casino is like an oasis in the black sea. After all the globetrotting ""Skyfall"" brings the action back home to Britain -- and Deakins finds a different kind of beauty in the crags and lochs of Scotland. Just on a pictorial level its enticing in a way few CGI spectaculars can match. (The credit sequence alone is among the most lustrous in the entire 007 canon.) Bond girls through the yearsMendes gambles big on a last act that cuts out all the gadgets and gizmos brings everything down to bare bones and ties the action to Bonds own history. He pulls it off in part because this apparently immortal series desperately needed someone to take a risk and because Mendes class really comes through in the performances. Judi Dench is probably incapable of being bad but M is a real character this time with emotions as well as convictions and she hits every note just so. Ben Whishaw is a breath of fresh air as a youthful Q and Craig himself remains the first 007 who might conceivably take down Sean Connery in hand-to-hand combat. Then theres Javier Bardem one-upping even his flamboyant psychopath from ""No Country for Old Men."" The only thing banal about his villain Silva is his name. It would be a sin to say too much about this character -- discover him for yourself -- but Bardems outre performance is simply delicious. Hes a warped mamas boy who fancies himself whisper it Bonds mirror image. Its been a long time since I enjoyed a Bond movie so much. By taking a good hard look at itself and going back to first principles ""Skyfall"" pulls off something quite special. This is Bond resurrected redeemed and reinvigorated ready to face a new half-century.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Skyfall Bond and Bardem Go Boom For its golden anniversary the old franchise gets spiffy and serious By Richard Corliss Nov. 09 2012 Share Read Later Francois Duhamel/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures/Columbia Pictures/EON Productions Skyfall Year 2012 Director Sam Mendes Studio Columbia Pictures Actors Daniel Craig Javier Bardem Ralph Fiennes Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Back from the dead again James Bond (Daniel Craig) shows up late one night in the apartment of his MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) who weeks before gave orders for him to be shot by a fellow spy while battling a bad guy on the top of a high-speed train. M never one for misting up explains it was just the rules of the espionage game which he should know by now ""Youve been playing it long enough."" Bond squints and says ""Maybe too long"" Is a half-century too long a career for a movie secret agent? The Bond series which began 50 falls ago with Dr. No outlived its 60s eclat which made Sean Connery a worldwide star and inspired dozens if not hundreds of smirky secret-agent capers then managed to coast through subsequent decades with the lightweights Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan as 007 and the minutest variations on the theme. Craig the sixth official Bond introduced a brute curt tone to the spy no suave dandy he was Her Majestys most efficient thug a Jason Bourne with sharper clothes and an English accent. But still 50 years. Why go on except to feather the estate of author Ian Fleming sustain the ambitions of the Broccoli family--the series producers from the beginning--and to feed an undemanding lifetime habit of the global audience? (READ Corliss on 50 Years of Bond Films) The cool accomplishment of Skyfall 23rd in the Broccoli franchise is that it seems a necessary rather than mandatory addition to the years popular culture. While trading on viewers familiarity with the series venerable fetishes (a cheer rises at the sight of Bonds old Aston Martin and the sound of Monty Normans guitar theme from Dr. No) Skyfall has the life grandeur and gravity of a satisfying stand-alone entertainment. There are times notably when Javier Bardem commandeers center screen as the preening villain Silva when you can sit back in wonder and forget its a Bond film. The script by old Bond hands Neal Purvis and Robert Wade with emendations by John Logan (Rango Hugo Sweeney Todd) nicely recasts its indomitable adventurer as a middle-age salaryman in a rut. The man needs rehab to overcome incipient alcoholism and a personal cause -- protecting M from Silvas revenge -- to stoke his spirit. As Bond is revived so is the franchise. This is one of its strongest efforts and surely the fizziest film ever directed by the over-awarded Sam Mendes whose previous work (American Beauty Road to Perdition Revolutionary Road) fells victim to tiresome social statements. Mendes seems fully energized here aided by Craig in his third Bond effort and some veteran craftspeople including cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner (both from Coen brothers movies) at the top of their game. Eve (Naomie Harris) the MI6 recruit set to assist and then shoot 007 has the right idea when she purrs ""Old dog new tricks."" Lets see which brilliant madmen is plotting global havoc this time? In Skyfall its Silva a cyber-brainiac who has stolen a list of Western undercover agents embedded in terrorist cells. Retrieving that computer chip was Bonds reason for being in Istanbul enduring a motorbike chase of Silvas henchman through the Grand Bazaar and over rooftops (three Craig Bond films three rooftop chases) and continuing the battle on the top of that speeding train where Eve shot Bond not the bad guy. While Bond is out of action the evil genius has hacked into Ms computer and blown up MI6 headquarters. While Ms government overseer Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) suggests she consider a graceful retirement the agency is moved to a subterranean cavern that would dwarf the Baths of Caracalla. Indeed much of the film takes place underground (in the London tube network) or underwater (where Bond falls to his presumed death at two crucial points). (READ Javier Bardem talks to TIME about becoming a Bond villain) From the moment Silva appears on an island whose inhabitants he scared away with another of his cyberthreats Skyfall ascends to a weirder wilder level. Making his Oscar-winning performance as the crazed stun-gun killer in the Coens No Country for Old Men seem like a triumph of minimalism by comparison Bardem parades the sick majesty of derangement. Silvas bleach-blond hair effeminate manner and fondness for stroking Bonds thighs and chest are mere ornaments to his psychopathy; whats scary is the way he has channeled his rage against M into an end-the-world view. He scores his atrocities with onomatopoeic tunes -- Charles Trenets ""Boum"" and The Animals ""Boom Boom"" -- and makes as pounding and resounding an impression. Bardem must have been instructed to go big Hannibal Lecter big and for most of the film he persuades that overacting is the only kind of acting. The other performers are just stenographers and stunt players. In the hour of movie time before Silva shows up the Craig Bond is enlisted to recall the Connery Bond drinking (though more than a gentleman should) fighting (in a splendid scene that shows the combatants as MMA silhouettes against the gaudy neon of a Shanghai skyscraper) and wooing. Skyfalls disposable Bond girl is Severine (Berenice Marlohe) silky ornament of the Macao casino and Bonds conduit to Silva. Marlohe of French-Chinese ancestry suggests a lustrous hybrid of Eva Green who played Bonds love Vesper Lynd in the 2006 Casino Royale and Gong Li. A vamp who is also a victim Severine cant quite mask her fear of Silva and his murderous minions; the thought freezes the edges of her practiced smile and lends her a poignance rare in the series for she wears her wounds with style. (READ Corliss on the 2006 Casino Royale) Except for a shave (with Eve) and a shower (with Severine) Bond has little time for sexy women. His central relationship here is with M his MI6 mum. Tiny frosty and powerful she is Queen Elizabeth II to Bonds (more assertive) Prince Charles. The Queen has her corgis M her beloved paperweight of a Churchillian bulldog draped in the Union Jack. Unlike Bernard Lee who played M as a gruff but understanding uncle in the first 11 Bond films Denchs M has shown a streak of meanness and an assumption that Bond is a valuable but replaceable asset. She assumes both that he will put his life on the line and that she can terminate him for purposes of national security. Yet Bond the abused son remains loyal -- why? He must love his country or her. Recall that at the opening ceremony of this summers London games Elizabeth made a guest appearance implicitly in the M role with Craig as Bond; the two purportedly leaped from a helicopter and sporting Union Jack parachutes landed in the Olympic Stadium -- a perfectly executed skyfall. The movie imagines a direr descent for M and Bond. Her life is threatened by another of her underloved sonny-boy spies Silva whom she turned over to Chinese agents for torture 15 years ago. He cannot forget mothers mistreatment. The screen of her computer which he has hacked shows a cartoon of M as the Queen morphing into a skull with the warning ""Think on your sins."" For Silva taking down Britain is just collateral damage to killing mommie dearest. All right Silva has mother issues to resolve but should Bond? One reason for the sustained appeal of 007 is that he was born grown up. Viewers could assume an aristocratic background and an Oxbridgean education but those social accoutrements mattered less than his choice in wines and guns. Flemings Bond a descendant of Sherlock Holmes Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer was a fantasy agent. It was his job not a way of exorcising family demons. (READ Roger Moore on why Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever) But the writers of Skyfall undoubtedly noticing the origin stories of Marvel superheroes like Spider-Man and Iron-Man decided to concentrate on Bonds past the death of his parents when he was a lad originally referred to in Flemings You Only Live Twice. As M observes with her standard chilliness ""Orphans make the best agents""; were to infer that Bond is so devoted to her because he lost his own mother. Thus at what should be its climax the movie takes a long detour to Scotland and Castle Bond (you can guess its name) where 007 M and Silva will have their final rendezvous. I realize that to be disappointed by the last act of Skyfall is to admit exhilaration at the preceding two hours. Grading Bond films is not the priority of a critic who like the rest of the world tends to consume them like multi-hundred-million-dollar TV shows (with the many product placements substituting for commercials). So one could call this the Best Bond Ever as some reviewers have and not mean it as the highest praise. Better to see it as a welcome defibrillator for a venerable franchise. On its way back from the dead like Bond the old dog has learned some new tricks.

MGM For fans of the Bond canon (and I count myself one) the stakes for the newest installment Skyfall are sky high. The film is the third starring Daniel Craig--by any reasonable assessment a better Bond than any since Sean Connery--and as such it possesses a kind of deciding-vote quality over the two that preceded it. The first Casino Royale was not merely 007s sharpest outing in 30-plus years but a fairly explicit rebuke to the borderline self-parody into which the franchise had sunk; the second Quantum of Solace--despite another excellent outing by Craig--was a soggy sequel timid and uninspired. Related Story The Graded Ranked and Non-Negotiable Guide to Every Bond Theme Song Thus the question Was Casino Royale an outlier in the decades-long stretch of Bondian disappointment? Or was Quantum of Solace the outlier in a new improved Age of Craig? Im delighted to report that Skyfall powerfully suggests the latter. The film directed by Sam Mendes is among the most ambitious imaginings of Bond to date dark supple and punctuated with moments of unanticipated visual brilliance. It begins as these affairs typically do with a chase. Or perhaps it might better be described as a meta-chase an early hint that the screenplay (by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan) will cast a knowing eye over the historical expanse of the franchise. A pursuit by car evolves into one by motorcycle before concluding in fisticuffs on the roof of a train. Throw in that it all takes place in Istanbul and weve nearly managed 50 years of Bond in miniature. Already however there are intimations that this will be no mere rehash. M (Judi Dench) orders Bond to abandon a wounded agent presumably to his death. And for all its backward glances the opening sequence will end in novel fashion As a consequence of Ms pitiless efficiency Bond is shot fallen evidently drowning. Cue up Adeles moody evocative theme song This is the end. Hold your breath and count to ten. Obsolescence and decay hang heavy over all that follows. Has M grown too old? Has Bond? These themes were toyed with in the non-canonical Thunderball remake Never Say Never Again which saw Connery return to action 12 years (and one broken ""never"" vow) after Diamonds Are Forever. But if that examination of 007s mortality was quasi-farce Skyfall tilts toward tragedy. A cyber-terrorist someone out of Ms past has targeted MI-6 itself and its unclear whether Bond--injured disillusioned full of drink and pills--is still a man to take on such challenges.Skyfall is at pains to advertise its breaks from the franchises past excesses. Craig and Dench are again superb and superb together as the hardened killer and the one person harder still. It is hardly a surprise that Mendes who directed American Beauty and Revolutionary Road has an ear for the strained and prickly marriage between the two. (M ""You know the rules of the game. Youve been playing it long enough. We both have."" Bond ""Maybe too long."" M ""Speak for yourself."") Less expected is Mendess eye for elegant venues on a planet Bond had long ago seemed to crisscross into exhaustion the summit of a glass tower in nighttime Shanghai with luminous billboard jellyfish blooming in the background; a luxurious gambling den floating off the shore of Macau; a battered and abandoned ghost-city on a forgotten island in the South China Sea. Like Casino Royale before it Skyfall is at pains to advertise its breaks from the franchises past excesses as when Bonds new Q (Ben Whishaw) offers him a meager haul of gadgetry. ""A gun and a radio? Its not exactly Christmas is it?"" grouses Bond. Qs response is tart ""Were you expecting an exploding pen?"" Yet even on this score the film is not without its sentimental indulgences as when Bond brings into service an old friend last seen in--no I wont spoil it.There are new friends along the way as well played by Ralph Fiennes Naomie Harris Berenice Marlohe and Albert Finney--himself a candidate for the role of Bond once upon a time. Memories are uncovered and past sins revisited. There are nods to Tennysons ""Ulysses"" and to the famously stolen Modigliani Woman with a Fan. And Bond enjoys what is to date his most explicit (and by far most amusing) brush with homoeroticism. The movie stumbles here and there. Though Javier Bardem has some nice moments as Bonds new nemesis he leans a bit heavily on Ledgers Joker and Hopkinss Lecter before the script disappointingly demotes him to a near-generic villainy. And while the closing act provides abundant catnip for Bond nostalgists it veers a few degrees hokier than necessary. But make no mistake. Skyfall both honors and revitalizes what has come before and offers compelling evidence that 007 is indeed back. As Bond himself replies when asked what hobbies he might have ""Resurrection."" Amen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Skyfall (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Skyfall (PG-13) The new Bond movie hits an all-time high for the series. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/9/2012 Editor rating 3.5 James Bond dies in Skyfall -- not literally of course. Fifty years since 1962s Dr. No the character remains so lucrative and profitable he is guaranteed to outlive us all. But everything that had grown stale and musty about the franchise which was successfully rebooted in 2006s Casino Royale but immediately fell back into the same rut with 2008s Quantum of Solace has been reinvented and invigorated and made to feel new again. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty Revolutionary Road) making his first giant-scale action picture delivers the requisite thrills every 007 movie must from a fantastic 20-minute opening chase sequence aboard motorcycles and trains that recalls vintage Spielberg to a brutal fistfight in Shanghai set against giant neon lights that is shot in one uninterrupted take so you feel every punch. Mendes approach to action is classical and elegant -- no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here -- but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors. In Skyfall we learn about Bonds past for the first time in the series (how didnt anyone think of this until now?) which makes Daniel Craigs squared-jawed hero seem more human and relatable more of a man than an action figure. The plot which is simpler than the trailers make it seem but is also much more memorable and moving involves the destruction of MI6 by an unknown traitor and the efforts by Bonds boss M (Judi Dench) to fend off the attempts by a British officer (Ralph Fiennes) to change her outdated ways and adapt to the horrible new world of cyber-terrorism. Thats all the plot youll get here. Skyfall is the first Bond movie I can remember in which the story actually matters and stays with you too. But mention must be made of Javier Bardems lip-smacking funny-yet-scary portrayal of Silva a madman with the worlds worst bleach job who is prone to florid speeches grandstanding theatrics and mean evil behavior. Bardem doesnt make his appearance until an hour into the film but Mendes gives him an entrance worthy of the wait a long showy monologue he recounts as he walks slowly toward the camera resulting in one of the funniest most unexpected exchanges in any Bond movie. Skyfall was shot by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men) who has never won an Oscar even though hes arguably the best in his field. Ranking Bond movies in terms of quality is a futile effort -- there are just too many -- but Im not exaggerating when I say this is by far the best-looking 007 film with luscious colors beautiful contrasts (check out the shot of a frozen lake with a burning house in the background) and a superb sense of framing. The movie is filled with little in-jokes for old-school fans (check out Qs coffee mug or the amusing bit with the eject button in Bonds Aston Martin) but Mendes also wants to make a film that can be taken seriously and Skyfall for all its considerable thrills works even better as a classy thoughtful drama. The theme of old-vs.-new courses throughout the movie -- how to use traditional tactics against villains who are unlike any who have come before -- and is resolved in a way that is melancholy and exciting. Skyfall hits all the notes every 007 movie is required to do -- even the shaken-not-stirred martini business is slyly handled -- but this movie is good enough to stand alone as a terrific thriller regardless of the series history.

Photo Francois Duhamel Associated Press Image 11 of 11 Skyfall review M is for mommy figure 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Skyfall Drama. Starring Daniel Craig Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Directed by Sam Mendes. (PG-13. 143 minutes.) Part of the romance of James Bond what has kept it thriving for 50 years is that the Bond life has seemed enviable sex and danger and thrills and beautiful women and exotic locations and great clothes ... but not this time. ""Skyfall"" is a different kind of Bond movie one that works just fine on its own terms but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One ""Skyfall"" is enough. Put simply James Bonds life is garbage. He cant seem to leave the house without getting shot. He has a drinking problem. His boss M (Judi Dench) seems to be failing at her job and physically hes not what he used to be. For the first half hour Craig goes through the movie unshaven and the white stubble around the chin isnt flattering. Whats more much is made of Bonds advancing age which seems unfair as Craig is only 44 - that is a year younger than Roger Moore was when he made his first Bond movie. But thats how it is at middle age If you smile you look young and if you dont you look old. But wait you might say surely this Bond has something to smile about. For example what about the ""Bond girls""? Every Bond movie has at least one a mysterious woman who puts Bond in danger until they team up two against the world to do battle against the forces of darkness. And its true there is most certainly a Bond girl in ""Skyfall."" Her name is Judi Dench. Yes there are two other women in the movie and they are the ostensible romantic interests. Naomie Harris plays a colleague with whom Bond has a somber frolic. And then theres Berenice Marlohe who looks like Eva Green smokes like Eva Green and is French like Eva Green. But she doesnt have anything near the part that Green had in ""Casino Royale."" Really she only has one important scene which she delivers well playing a woman pretending to be the soul of cool while terrified. So its Dench who occupies that central place in the films structure and in Bonds affections and this does a number of things none of them good. First it replaces a sexual relationship with a mother-son type relationship less fun for all concerned. Second it forces an already subdued Bond into a mode of dutifulness and subordination; that is it turns a bad boy into a good son. Dull. Finally it throws the emphasis on M who was fine in small doses but under scrutiny seems rather sour and ungiving and a pretty cold Mommy as mother figures go. Moreover the evidence suggests that M is an incompetent administrator. Still just taken as action film and not as an entry into the James Bond canon ""Skyfall"" is entertaining and fast-moving with a well-constructed sequence involving a car chase a shootout a motorcycle chase and a duel to the death on top of a train - all before the opening credits. Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins provide the film with elegance and polish including a number of shots that are eye-catching and some that are more than that. For example the sight of Bond as seen from behind as he turns into a silhouette in the frame of a doorway. Or better yet the introduction of the villain (Javier Bardem) who seen at first from a distance slowly walks toward the camera as he calmly tells a story. Bardem is another of the films assets nicely embodying a villain who is giddy and brilliant and easily as happy as Bond is miserable. Bardem owns every scene hes in though the screenplay makes ill use of him Instead of having a grievance against Bond he has a grievance (a legitimate one at that) against M. So once again Bond is a bystander. This had better not be a trend. Daniel Craig is still the second-best Bond ever but he is falling into the Timothy Dalton trap of emphasizing the darker aspects of the character and blocking out the light. It says something when you leave a Bond movie feeling nostalgic for the radiant self-satisfaction of the Roger Moore Bond. Craigs Bond could use some cheering up. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Bonds loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is tested as MI6 comes under attack. 007 (Daniel Craig) must track down and destroy the threat no matter how personal the cost. (Photo amp; Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 8 2012 736 p.m. ET Who needs James Bond? The question is posed in ""Skyfall"" in the context of a debate about the role of old-fashioned human intelligence in a high-tech world of brilliant youngsters and an apostle of technology offers a snide answer ""Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled."" In the context of a revitalized franchise the answer is that we need 007 even after half a century of his ups and downs in various incarnations to remind us how deeply pleasurable an action thriller can be. The latest addition to the Bond canon goes beyond thrilling into chilling and enthralling plus a kind of stirring that has nothing to do with martinis. ENLARGE Daniel Craig stars as James Bond in Skyfall. Sony Pictures The movie opens hair-trigger style with a man pointing a gun. The man is Daniel Craigs incarnation of Bond flinty-eyed with a closed-off soul and the sequence gets under way on the streets and rooftops of Istanbul; continues on a train where in the midst of definitive chaos James pauses to shoot his shirt cuffs out of his jacket sleeves; ends with a certified shocker and earns instant admission to the pantheon of classic chases. (The surreal credits that follow are no slouch either with Adele singing the title song.) None of that constitutes breaking news since extravagant action has long been a Bond staple. The distinction of ""Skyfall"" lies in the elegance of everything that sets off what its sensationally entertaining villain Silva calls ""all this jumping and fighting"" all this ""running around."" Photos Happy Birthday James Bond The opening sequence of ""Licence to Kill"" shows Timothy Dalton as James Bond in 1989. Ronald Grant Archive / Mary Evan Silva is played by Javier Bardem who manages--and this is the highest praise for a lowlife invention--to transcend the archvillainy of Anton Chigurh the nailgun-wielding monster he played in ""No Country for Old Men."" He does this not with physical weaponry but with an actors arsenal of skill and daring. Silvas affect is often light like his bleached hair. Hes a monster who uses whimsy to express menace a malign raconteur who savors the details of a ghastly story about survivalist rats. (The astute script was written by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan.) Mr. Bardem is only one of several top-flight actors who flourish under the direction of Sam Mendes. Mr. Craigs distillation of toughness and hurt tells us all we need to know of Bonds inner life. Judi Denchs M has given six previous Bond films a grounding that verges on gravitas. This time Dame Judi turns the role into a meditation on mortality along with a celebration of minimalist precision (as in her reading of the line ""Take the bloody shot"") and gets to fire off a few shots of her own. The cast includes Naomie Harris Ralph Fiennes Berenice Marlohe Ben Whishaw and as icing on the exploding cake of a giant climax the great Albert Finney playing a gamekeeper with a sense of history. Related Fifty Years of Bond Cars dont usually get applause from movie audiences though one of Bonds rides did just that at my screening. And producers dont usually get praise from movie critics though its warranted for Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson whose stewardship of the franchise is back on track after a near-derailment in ""The Quantum of Solace."" The kinetic pageant theyve put together is smart about many important things showmanship sexual politics visual splendor. ( Roger Deakins was the cinematographer.) The only false note is the straw-man dialectic of the plot No one in the intelligence community these days would argue against the value of human operatives. Yet the movies smartest suit is emotional intelligence ""Skyfall"" keeps us caring intensely for a hero who by any rational measure is a vestige of a vanished era. ENLARGE Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln. DreamWorks Lincoln The carnage of war provides a preface to Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" just as it did in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But this is carnage of a sort so old--a war in which fists strangulations and stompings supplement bullets and bayonets--that its depiction on screen seems new. Mr. Spielbergs remarkable film seems old and new too genuinely old in its beautifully rendered settings and costumes; genuinely new in its placement of our 16th president portrayed in eccentric glory by Daniel Day-Lewis within the politics of his day. ( Tony Kushners electrifying screenplay was partly based on Doris Kearns Goodwins ""Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."") Primarily though not exclusively a drama of ideas ""Lincoln"" concentrates on the last months of the presidents life when he sought to do nothing less than unite the nation by ending the Civil War and end slavery by pushing the 13th Amendment through a fractious Congress. These were conflicting goals and Lincoln pursued them with an idealists fervor and a pragmatists gift for the rough and tumble of the political process. Watch a clip from the Steven Spielberg historical drama ""Lincoln"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis Sally Field Tommy Lee Jones Joseph Gordon-Levitt James Spader Jared Harris John Hawkes and Jackie Earle Haley. (Photo amp; Video Dreamworks) Youll have to go elsewhere for a rundown of all the characters and their intricate often devious motives. (Honest Abe himself was wondrously devious when the situation demanded it.) Indeed the film which has the courage of its complexity must have been made on the assumption that moviegoers would later go elsewhere--to books on the subject or discussions in educational settings--for a deeper understanding of what theyd seen. (Long after its commercial run ""Lincoln"" will remain an invaluable teaching tool.) For now though be assured that the political process in question is so vital as to leave you amazed at what it once was--a rowdy arena of accusations denunciations venality in the service of virtue virtue for its own sake or venality pure and simple and none of it shaped by opinion polls--as well as dismayed by the dumbshow its become. The cast uniformly superb includes Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens Hal Holbrook as Lincoln adviser Preston Blair Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln David Strathairn as William Seward and James Spader as political operative W.N. Bilbo. The production was designed by Rick Carter and photographed by Janusz Kaminski with original music by John Williams. Mr. Spielbergs direction is hugely energetic and almost invisible a fine combination though his film like the people it portrays is imperfect. A teachable moment at the start turns into awkward speechifying about the inequities between black and white soldiers in the Union army. And the ending bespeaks uncertainty about whether and how the presidents death needed to be shown; a fade-out could have come at the moment he turns walks slowly down a hall and leaves for Fords Theater. Yet the portrait of Lincoln transcends conventional judgments; its a complete creation perfect on its own terms. Mr. Day-Lewis who normally speaks in a rich baritone chose a tenor range and reedy timbre thats closer to whats known of Lincolns voice from historical sources. The effect is startling unsettling and entirely convincing. The actor also gives his subject a singular set of physical behaviors--arms and hands in constant motion as if pulled by a puppeteer; demeanor bleak more often than bright; posture stooped shoulders narrow. Still these are external choices and Mr. Day-Lewis works famously and phenomenally from the inside out. The mystery at the core of his gorgeous performance which is enhanced by Mr. Kushners script has to do with his masterly grasp of Lincolns quicksilver spirit. This president is a man of the people when he tells a bawdy story about Washingtons portrait in a latrine. But hes a man for the ages when in advance of congressional action on abolishing slavery he draws himself up and declares wrathfully ""I am the president of the United States of America clothed in immense power. You will procure me these votes."" Thats acting. Thats writing. That is indelibly the Abraham Lincoln we only thought we knew. ENLARGE Mads Mikkelsen and Alicia Vikander Magnolia Pictures A Royal Affair With its sumptuous settings urgent romance and intellectual substance ""A Royal Affair"" is a mind-opener crossed with a bodice-ripper. Nicolaj Arcels Danish-language film which he wrote with Rasmus Heisterberg starts in 1766 with an English girls fateful journey to Denmark. Caroline Mathilde a sister of Britains King George III makes the trip to marry her cousin the Danish King Christian VII ( Mikkel Boe Folsgaard) and become his queen. Shes only 15 but already cultivated and accomplished and Alicia Vikanders performance spans the next nine years with lovely authority. What Caroline doesnt know is that her husband-to-be is infantile willful and insane. This is suggested in a piquant imagining of their first meeting in a field; Christian isnt visible for a while because hes hiding behind a tree. (The films inventions are so dramatic and entertaining that youre tempted to think of the whole thing as fiction but the main elements of the script hew remarkably close to historical fact.) What Caroline cant imagine at this frightening juncture is that her life will be transformed by the royal physician Johann Friederich Struensee a man of the Enlightenment whose seductiveness extends far south of his brain since hes played by the marvelous Mads Mikkelsen. Mr. Mikkelsens face is unmistakable with its high cheekbones brooding eyes and chiseled lips and his character is the plots fulcrum. For Caroline Struensee opens up the world of learning and of love. For Christian the royal doctor is a constant companion who drinks with the king and whores with him but never judges him. Whats more Struensee turns the king into a progressive force in a struggle against the power brokers and connivers of the State Council who have kept Denmark poor and ignorant in the name of tradition and faith. Still Struensee is an overreacher as well as an adulterer. While hundreds of laws are being passed--enlightened laws that will open the country to the winds of change--the conditions of his downfall are inexorably coalescing. ""A Royal Affair"" is overlong; the inexorable comes more slowly than it might. For the most part though this superb film which was photographed by Rasmus Videbaek and scored by Gabriel Yared and Cyrille Aufort tells an absorbing tale with a remarkable sense of intimacy. At several points Struensee is warned of the myth of Lancelot and Guinevere. At others the story recalls the fraught relationship between the doctor and his volatile patient in ""The Last King of Scotland."" The king himself as Mr. Folsgaard plays him is interesting enough to sustain a movie of his own but Struensee has the majesty of his contradictions--formidable intelligence a loving heart and a fatal lust for power. DVD Focus ENLARGE Javier Bardem in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Weinstein Company/Everett Collection Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) Javier Bardem isnt villainous in Woody Allens wittily libidinous romantic comedy. Hes a man in the midst of intense femininity a Spanish painter who encounters two American friends on vacation in Spain-- Rebecca Halls Vicky who believes in an orderly life and Scarlett Johanssons Cristina whose feelings spin every which way. ( Penelope Cruz is the painters loose revolver of an ex-wife.) Still its easy to see in his blithe performance many of the traits that have made him such a terrific bad guy--the screwy insouciance the cheery hedonism the comfort zone that includes all sorts of contradictory feelings. ENLARGE All the Kings Men All the Kings Men (1949) A poisonous political process from our not-so-distant past dominates Robert Rossens classic film about the rise of a Southern demagogue. Broderick Crawford is Willie Stark a self-described hick transformed by degrees into a bully with a taste for booze a weakness for women and a power lust of spectacular proportions. The film was adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren; he modeled his hero on Huey P. Long Jr. the larger-than-life governor and then senator who dominated the political scene in Louisiana from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. Avoid the 2006 remake starring Sean Penn. ENLARGE Casino Royale Casino Royale (2006) Mads Mikkelsen is Le Chiffre the mournfully menacing banker who weeps blood in the self-described prequel that introduced Daniel Craig as a newly minted James Bond. The terrorists here are nobodies with no distinguishing characteristics or ideologies. What deepens the drama is the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd a lissome mostly cool British Treasury official played superbly by Eva Green. Martin Campbell directed a cast that includes Jeffrey Wright; Giancarlo Giannini; the movies producer Michael G. Wilson as a police chief; and of course Judi Dench putting her inimitable stamp on the role of M. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 4 2012 ShareThis (Photo David James/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox) Four score and seven filmsat leastmight have been contrived from events in the life of Abraham Lincoln but in Lincoln Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner home in on a narrow segment a few short months in 1865 before Lincoln was shot. The focus is not on the civil war that took hundreds of thousands of American lives or the assassination that came less than a week after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. (Lincolns death is the films tragic denouement not its climax.) The prism through which Spielberg and Kushner view the sixteenth president of the United States is politicsthe fine and coarse art of persuasion the machine in a democracy through which ideals are translated into legislation and legislation into law. By Spielbergian standards Lincoln is a nuanced knotty bridled piece of filmmaking an exercise in restraint. But Spielberg is a great film artist and that tone evokes the spirit of his subjectthe deep sadness the expansive sardonic wit the hardscrabble lawyerly intelligence. By the time the movie ends you dont feel as if you know Lincolnfew in his own time claimed to know him. But you feel as if you know what it was like to be in his presence. And so an icon (its a measure of how promiscuously that word is thrown around that it seems inadequate for one of historys truly iconic figures) has become a manand startlingly within reach. All this despite a stinkeroo first dialogue scenea real comedown after the chilling prologue a rain-soaked skirmish in which black Union soldiers go bayonet to bayonet with rebels and no man dies without an agonizing struggle. Then Spielberg introduces the president (Daniel Day-Lewis) from behind his monumental head gazing down at a pair of African-American survivors one awestruck the other inclined to press his case (respectfully) for Negroes to be paid the same as whites. The exchange sounds both too modern (You got springy hair for a white man) and too corny (they and others quote at length from the Gettysburg Address). But in its clunky way it serves a purpose. Lincoln is already halfway to a memorialwhich gives him more pause than anyone. And it quickly establishes the central issue. The Emancipation Proclamation freed black people but didnt make them equal. Actually it didnt even free them fully. It was an executive order in a time of warand the war was almost over. Hence the need for the Thirteenth Amendment which doesnt yet have the two-thirds majority to pass. Early on theres a lot of political shoptalk not all of it easy to follow especially with Day-Lewis looking so distractingly Lincolnesque. Theres no record of Lincolns voice or of how he moved but Day-Lewis captures what contemporaries described as a mysterious private sadnessas well as the ability to shake it off and be suddenly open and generous. Its a running joke here (as it was apparently in life) that Lincoln would launch into an illustrative anecdote or quotation at the drop of a stovepipe hat. But those stories are enthrallingand what a beautiful tall brow the actor has to furrow. Day-Lewis speaks in a soft cracked voice (with a hint still of the sonorous John Hustonesque quiver he developed for There Will Be Blood) and you can taste Lincolns pleasure in choosing each word in lulling his listeners with indirection before driving the point homeas when he likens his cabinet to pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters and declares I am the president of the United States clothed in immense power and you will procure me these votes He has a formidable team from David Strathairns powerfully prim Seward (once Lincolns rival for the Republican presidential nomination) to the trio of lobbyists dispatched to bend ears and twist arms to bribe and to lie rangy John Hawkes swollen-chested mustachioed James Spader and spring-heeled Tim Blake Nelson. We thrill to their escapades because theyre on Lincolnsourside but its depressing to see what pitiful cowards some of their targets are. (The racist states-rights bad guys are Democrats the liberals Republicanswhich means you have to do a little pirouette in your head whenever the party names are dropped.) Tommy Lee Jones eyes sagging under a thick-locked toupee has the scene-stealing role as the riotously belligerent abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. Counseled to play nice to say he doesnt believe that blacks should be equal only that they should be equal before the law his Stevens gazes on opponents with the bile rising in his throat visibly tortured by having to betray his ideals for the sake of a vote. But it is of course a vote that will change the course of historyin the right direction. 1 2 Next Share this story...

By David Denby Denzel Washington in a film by Robert Zemeckis.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman In ""Flight"" Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) an ace airline pilot wakes up in an Orlando hotel after a night spent with a flight attendant (Katerina Marquez) takes a swig of beer and does a line of cocaine. We next see him getting into a cockpit and flying a plane headed for Atlanta through a fearsome storm and into the clear. Then standing at the front of the plane he reassures the passengers while he pours--one arm working behind a bulkhead--several little bottles of vodka into a quart of orange juice. Back in the cockpit swacked he falls asleep only to be awakened when the planes tail malfunctions sending the craft into a forty-eight-hundred-foot dive. The films director Robert Zemeckis staged a frightening plane crash in ""Cast Away"" and this one as the fuselage begins to come apart is even more alarming. After maneuvers so strange that I would rather you disbelieve them on your own Whip belly-flops the craft more or less safely in an empty field. Im letting you know that the landing is a success because that isnt what the movie is about. ""Flight""--the title has a double meaning--is devoted not to heroism but to furtiveness to the strategy of lying bluffing and endless evasion which allows an intelligent and talented man to get through life as an alcoholic. Two things are clear from the beginning no other pilot could have made that particular landing; and Whips condition had nothing to do with what went wrong with the plane. On the contrary the cocaine and the booze may have given him the courage to try the daredevil stunt that saved the day. Yet Whip gets found out. Six people die in the crash and a toxicology report combined with the empty vodka bottles puts him in danger of criminal charges. The National Transportation Safety Board and a lawyer hired by the pilots union (Don Cheadle) sort out Whips various sins and recovering from injuries he retires temporarily to his fathers empty country house with a lost young heroin addict (Kelly Reilly) whom he meets in the hospital. At first she seems to be in worse shape than he is. Shes not. He drinks stops starts again. ""Flight"" is not acrid or cruel like Billy Wilders ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945) in which we see the world through the eyes of Ray Millands character as he suffers the d.t.s. Nor is it soaked in the romantic poetry of self-destruction in the manner of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) in which Nicolas Cage with Elisabeth Shue at his side undergoes an extended liquid self-immolation in a hotel room. The screenwriter of ""Flight"" John Gatins apparently drawing on his own experience of bad times has made with Zemeckis an earnest and vibrantly matter-of-fact film. ""Flight"" is intricately knowledgeable about such things as where to stash bottles and little packets of cash. It demonstrates a fine appreciation of the necessary labors of an amiable candyman (John Goodman) who shows up with dope and drink whenever Whip needs him. Zemeckis avoids any expressionistic re-creations of an alcoholics world. We look at Whip from the outside clearly even relentlessly and the director lets his star work in extended takes which turn out to be more revealing than an internal point of view. Washington allows his body to go puffy and slack. His gaze is unfocussed his walk loose and shambling except when Whip does some coke at which point Washington moves in a confident swinging lope. Whip is a proud man but Washington lets us see the narcissism and the self-pity behind the pride a ready access to anger that gives Whip a moment of relief as he tells people off drawing deeper into guilt and futility. He gets drunk when he most needs to be sober. His messes are defiant as if he thought that they were an accomplishment. The causes of his alcoholism are not examined which is just as well--explanations of a condition so elemental and encompassing risk banality. As the film goes along steadily slowly it puts us in the ambivalent position of admiring Denzel Washingtons bravery and candor and disliking the character he plays. We get tired of watching Whip fail and were caught between dismayed pity and a longing to see him punished. Only a great actor could have pulled off this balancing act. I was reminded of Laurence Oliviers bravura in ""The Entertainer"" in which he plays an exhausted old vaudevillian. At a certain point great actors want to show us the truth of something that may be far from their lives but that somehow they understand intimately all too well. ""Skyfall"" marks the fiftieth anniversary of the mother and father of all franchises. It would be lovely to announce that the new Bond movie is scintillating or at least rambunctiously exciting but ""Skyfall"" in the recent mode of Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" films is a gloomy dark action thriller and almost completely without the cynical playfulness that drew us to the series in the first place. ""Skyfall"" offers portents of the end of the possible termination of 007 (Daniel Craig) and also of the Tennyson-quoting M. (Judi Dench); and it suggests too the looming irrelevance of M.I.6 which turns out to be not the powerful center of intelligence but just another station in a world of infinitely hackable networks. The Bond movies offered the exhilarating freedom of travel--James caressed by soft breezes and swaying palms--but distance is now meaningless. Evil may erupt wherever theres a computer. Its certainly no longer confined to a place like China or Russia or an underground redoubt or a tropical island where an unspeakably malevolent genius with precise diction threatens to take over the world. The enemy this time is no more than a former M.I.6 agent Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) a giggling blond creep who reveals the names of other agents and caresses Bonds knees (the two acts of aggression are treated as equals). Appearance-wise he seems intended to be a cross between Julian Assange and Andy Warhol. But Silva also harbors a grudge against M. Indeed both Bond and Silva are obsessed with M.; Silva hates her and Bond in his way loves her. They are like two quarrelling sons. The director Sam Mendes has taken a pop concept and solemnized it with Freud which is not perhaps the best way of turning Bond into grownup entertainment. Judi Dench acts with her usual fierce concentration and I should report that theres a neat scamper across rooftops this time with motorcycles not to mention the reliable old nonsense of a car chase that manages to smash every fruit stand in the street. In terms of spectacle the Bond franchise has long been overtaken by its rivals and in this movie many of the action sequences including an apparent death by drowning seem borrowed from other recent movies (see the watery plunge in ""Bourne""). Daniel Craig is amusingly single-minded. He has the strange attractiveness--prominent nose hooded eyes narrowed forehead--of an intelligent cobra. Hes dry a little grudging even with only the flicker of a smile and no discernible soul. Of course he doesnt need a soul. What would be the bloody use of it? as M. might say. Just as he is hes sufficient for his job his body a frequently unsheathed weapon alabastered and fast cutting through cluttered sets and straitened passageways. Looking back over the half century of films however I still long for Sean Connery. Connery was shrewd and piratical--he let us in on the fun of being wicked. An ironist he knew that the role was absurd but that the desire for fantasy wasnt. He was the gentleman-rogue hero--aristocratic in disdain yet classless--of every mans dream of himself and women could enjoy him as the adroit cad who arrives at night delivers the goods and leaves in the morning. Connery took his time. His drawling pauses as he calculated his advantage were a prime comic device the manner of a brute swathed in sophistication so sure of success that he never needed to rush. Roger Moore of course was more Brut than brute. He gave off the aura of a luxury product in an airline magazine--an expensive leather case perhaps rubbed rather too often with oil. He was neither shaken nor stirred; he was smooth unmarked by experience in any way. George Lazenby and the gracious Timothy Dalton never really took control of the role but Pierce Brosnan with his big handsome head atop a slender body could be flinty. He had an interesting mean streak and the habits of cold indifference. He was lithe and quick yet not really a menace like the big-bodied Connery or the steel-springed Craig. The earlier Bonds were superlative lovers of food spirits and women. As box-office has become truly internationalized however the producers may have feared that a too knowing Bond might not please everyone. Such a connoisseur could turn off moviegoers who object to the notion of being outclassed. The Bond franchise will continue though I doubt we shall ever again hear Bond say as Connery did in ""Goldfinger"" that a certain brandy was a ""thirty-year-old fins indifferently blended sir with an overdose of bons bois."" I dont know what bons bois is but I enjoyed the astringent flavor of Connerys judgment.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

At area theaters and IMAX. So much time has been spent bickering about the right guy to fill 007s shoes and natty tux over the decades that other vital questions have fallen by the wayside. So forget for a moment the arguments about the best -- or second-best in this case -- James Bond ever. Craggy handsome oh-so-serious Daniel Craig has secured the title. Instead if the entertaining globe-trotting (if rather long-winded) ""Skyfall"" is any indication then it will take another installment of this just-turned-50 franchise to find the perfect ratio of serious-to-wry. Craig has settled into a well-suited grim-reaper role. Even when James flirts and trysts his creased face suggests an unmovable weight. Which means the writers and director need to find the franchises enduring smirk someplace or on someone else. But Craigs post-9/11 super-agent hasnt yet met his match in terms of storytelling. Gifted Sam Mendes (""Road to Perdition"" ""Revolutionary Road"") isnt that guy. Far too serious. Though this installment -- penned by Bond vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade and Oscar- and Tony-winner John Logan -- teases some rich themes. (It also sets up Bonds next chapter nicely.) Neither was talented Marc Forster. His ""Quantum of Solace"" was too much hurly-burly action oddly from a director known for tapping deeper emotions. Is it possible that the legacy of Bond overwhelms more serious directors? They seem to arrive on the set wanting to prove they can do popular. That or the franchises heirs meddle too much. Journeyman director Martin Campbell set the best tone when Bond was reintroduced in ""Casino Royale."" Bond the franchise remains a Goldilocks conundrum in search of a ""just right."" That said theres hardly a lack of onscreen talent gathered to tell this adventure that pits Bond against a masterful villain obsessed with humiliating MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) by outing operatives embedded in terrorist organizations. Javier Bardem channeling some serious ""ick"" portrays Silva the baddie with the muddy motives. Ralph Fiennes enters the fray as Gareth Mallory. The new chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee appears to be a bureaucrat come to nudge M out of her job. To help her he suggests in his dry way that she retire gracefully. Albert Finney makes for a welcome presence when he shows up late in the action as Kincade a burly feisty old soul who knows more than a bit about 007s past. Did we say old? Did we utter the word retirement? Did we forget to mention that when James resurfaces after being presumed dead he looks worse for the wear. He looks well older. He puts on a good face but hes not quite up to the rigors of the gig at least not physically. Some of that is the fault of a gunshot followed by a long improbable tumble into a gorge. But some of its just plain wear and tear. In this regard James could be likened to a certain older but incredibly wiser NFL quarterback. And once you make that Broncos-friendly comparison you know that like No. 18 Bond is up for anything. Though ""Skyfall"" rides on baby boomer fantasies not everyone in ""Skyfall"" is being courted by the AARP. Boyish Ben Whishaw (""Cloud Atlas"") portrays the chic-geek Q beneath a fab mop of brown hair. Two new leggy lovelies arrive to represent the beckoning faces of good and if not quite evil not-quite-trustworthy. Berenice Marlohe is the mysterious Severine wholl lead Bond to Silva. Naomie Harris is a fine addition as MI6 agent Eve. With a Cheshire grin and knowing eyes the Londoner (who had her breakout role in Danny Boyles zombie flick ""28 Days Later"") seems to grasp better than any one else onscreen that the serious business of her Majestys secret service can always be made better with a little wink and slink.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 8 2012 Save for later Saved Daniel Craig stars as superspy James Bond in Skyfall his third installment in the part. Francois Duhamel/Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The James Bond movie franchise is 50 years old but judging from the latest entry ""Skyfall"" its aged remarkably well. Daniel Craig in his third outing as 007 has taken over the role in a way that makes it his as distinctively as it was Sean Connerys all those years ago.This distinction comes with a price. While I recognize that Craigs nuggety almost thuggish approach to Bond was perhaps a necessary corrective to the dapper sleekness of Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore I also regret that much of the playfulness has gone out of the series. Craigs Bond is a lot closer to Jason Bourne than he is to any of the previous Bonds (although the first two Connery movies ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" were often decidedly ""dark"").Still even though Craigs Bond isnt exactly the wish-fulfillment fantasy that Connerys was hes a more powerful and powerfully conflicted screen presence. (By Bond movie standards hes practically chaste this time out.) ""Skyfall"" fills in 007s back story in psychologically resonant ways. I came out of the movie feeling Id seen not just an action spy extravaganza but you know a ""real movie."" Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The film opens with an elaborate chase through Istanbul that leaves Bond presumably dead. We of course know otherwise but it takes a TV report of a bomb demolishing Londons M16 headquarters to bring him back from a dissolute life of exotic beachside anonymity. M (Judi Dench) has already posted his obituary. Without so much as a double take she reintegrates him into the spy network that has increasingly come under high-level fire for being antiquated in an era of shadowy stateless terrorists and cyber warfare. (Q is now a geeky cyber whiz played by Ben Whishaw who disdains Bonds smash-and-grab approach.) The 50 best movies of all time Video Skyfall trailer Monitor Movie Guide ""Skyfall"" is essentially a rousing defense of old-school sypmastering as personified by Bond whose skills have been degraded by his near-death exploits. He must redeem M under whose watch a hard drive containing the names of NATO agents who have infiltrated global terrorist organizations has fallen into the wrong hands.Those hands belong to Silva (Javier Bardem) a cyber wacko whose golden hair and toothy smile are malevolence incarnate. Silva has his own history with M. Both he and Bond share a psychological connection to her that is decidedly Freudian.Director Sam Mendes is best known for the highly overrated ""American Beauty"" a far inferior movie to ""Skyfall."" With the help of screenwriters Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan hes discovered his stride here a blend of thrills and sabotage and deep-dish emotionalism. The powerful performances by Craig and Dench surely owe a great deal to his indulgences.I trust it wont take another four years for the next installment in the series. With all the talk in ""Skyfall"" about outmoded spy methods and achy agents I wouldnt wait too long to once again cash in on Craig. Grade A- (Rated PG-13 for intense violent sequences throughout some sexuality language and smoking.)

It might sound blasphemous but in Skyfall Daniel Craig has it all over previous 007s.Since taking on the James Bond mantle in 2006 with Casino Royale Craig has injected a vital transfusion of fresh plasma into a franchise that began in 1962 with Sean Connery in Dr. No.In Skyfall (3 1/2 stars out of four; rated PG-13; opens today nationwide) Bond is essentially reborn after being shot and left for dead. (The same could be said of the franchise after 2008s disappointing Quantum of Solace.) Re-booted in intriguing ways Skyfall still respects its predecessors. Nods to classic Bond-isms are duly meted out incorporating the super-spys distinctive martini order classic Aston Martin and array of snazzy gadgetsThe 44-year-old Craig owns Bond now. Hes a 007 whos no super-hero with his graying stubble and slight tremor when firing a gun. Those details help humanize the ultra-suave character. Craig is still believable as a guy who can leap on a moving train and tussle with a bad guy. And terminally cool he looks ever-dashing in an exquisitely tailored suit.ALEXANDER Javier Bardem gets in Bonds head as Skyfall villainFREYDKIN Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe double up for 007PHOTOS These Bond Girls have something specialPHOTOS A rogues gallery of Bond villainsDirector Sam Mendes take on Bond sizzles with style and substance. With breakneck-paced action sequences Skyfall is also a superbly cast witty and grown-up escapade.As dictated in these tales based on Ian Flemings novels a cartoonish arch-villain menaces Bond. And who better to play a malevolent creep than Javier Bardem whose blood-curdling murderer with bad hair in No Country for Old Men is the stuff of nightmares. As it turns out Bardems Silva is a new-fangled nemesis settling old scores via cyber-terrorism. The film intriguingly raises the question of whether traditional espionage methods are being rendered obsolete in an age where cyber hackers can instantly gather covert information with far less risk.Before we meet Bardem in yet another bad coif -- this one blond -- theres an eye-popping opening credit sequence with a title song by Adele that recalls Shirley Basseys signature Goldfinger theme.The story takes off with a series of suspenseful chases in a style closer to Bourne than Bond. To root out evil 007 trots the globe from Turkey to London to Shanghai to Macau and finally to remote Scotland.Chases through exotic bazaars across precarious bridges and on the windswept moors are exhilarating as is a scene in which Bond dangles on a skyscrapers elevator just before sneaking up on a bad guy silhouetted against the dazzling neon of Shanghai at night.Bonds boss M (Judi Dench) is threatened by the nasty Silva a computer genius and the fates of M Bond and all of MI6 Britains intelligence agency are imperiled. .After being off the grid a while Bond returns spurred by his loyalty to M.Even at nearly 2 1/2 hours the spectacle is consistent though a climactic explosive battle goes on a bit too long.As superb as the special effects can be its the cast that renders it irresistible. Bardem is sneeringly fiendish as Silva Judi Dench is an intriguing blend of stern Machiavellian matriarch and honest vulnerability. Fiennes is spot-on as Ms efficient boss Mallory and Ben Whishaw is droll as research whiz and gadget maker Q.Over the past half century audiences have been shaken and stirred by 007 movies and entertained in varying doses by a succession of brawny Bonds. Consistently high-caliber Skyfall is the ideal way to celebrate the 50-year mark.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Prince Charles and Camilla met the cast of the latest Bond movie Skyfall at the movies World premiere in London and on the red carpet Daniel Craig and Bond girl Naomie Harris talked stunts while Dame Judi Dench revealed the inspiration behin... 863 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 36 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/PFOKWr,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/08/skyfall-review/1672055/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,skyfall13,skyfall,usatoday

Bond is giving chase and thats all that matters -- cars careening through bazaars motorcycles flying across rooftops until Daniel Craigs 007 lands atop a speeding train. ""Atop"" is a problem though; how to get inside? Maybe by commandeering a derrick from a car in back ripping a hole in the roof of a passenger car and leaping through the hole just as the back of the car tears off. Landing in the aisle Bond straightens his jacket cuffs squares his shoulders and heads off to get the bad guy. Imagine Bourne doing that. Oh sure he could do the leaps and stunts -- but the cuff-check? No way. Seals the deal. And were not even to the opening credits yet. Viewers with long memories will be aware that 007 knows this territory. Both trains and Istanbul figure in From Russia With Love the second -- and to many of us the best -- Bond film thus far. Skyfalls blistering Turkish opening is the first hint (of many; theres an Aston Martin coming) that director Sam Mendes is deliberately calling up the good old days back when Q (Ben Whishaw in this new incarnation) wasnt handing out quite so many implausible gizmos and when Sean Connery was the only imaginable Bond. Happily Daniel Craig cements the case he made as a worthy Bond successor a few years back in Casino Royale (lets all agree to forget Quantum of Solace). Theres a gritty real-world feel to Skyfall that makes good use of Craigs down-to-earthiness. This time though hes got Mendes and the much-admired cinematographer Roger Deakins behind him to make those big set pieces seriously sleek.

(Why Scotland? Well maybe because Connery had a brogue. Doesnt matter. Cool isolated estate with Albert Finney lurking for reasons I should probably leave unsaid.) The stars and the explosions are backed up by plenty of class -- Ralph Fiennes as Ms new boss Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe as a couple of the requisite Bond beauties and Judi Dench finally given the space to turn M into a full-bodied character. Arguably Skyfalls finale is too drawn out but it leads to a payoff rewarding enough that youll hear no complaints from me. Youd think that 50 years in the Bond series would be gasping for breath not leaving you breathless.

Daniel Craigs grittier 007 faces contemporary sexuality and imperial angst in the moody spectacular ""Skyfall"" Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Daniel Craig james bond Javier Bardem Movies Our Picks skyfall Entertainment News Reinventing the James Bond franchise to fit the sexual and cultural politics of the 21st century is a dicey proposition at best and its safe to say weve seen mixed results so far. If Daniel Craigs 2006 debut as Bond in ""Casino Royale"" was a smashing success bringing a new physicality and cinematic verve to the series along with a touch of real-world anomie the dour and violent ""Quantum of Solace"" arguably went too far in the latter direction. (I actually thought it was an interesting experiment if not an entirely successful one but fans who complained that it didnt seem much like a Bond movie were correct.) That 225 million misstep nearly succeeded in killing off the series - which left the world of Ian Flemings novels behind long long ago - but now Bond and Craig are back in ""Skyfall"" a rich impressive overstuffed and rather chilly spectacle that already looks like the biggest hit in franchise history even before its American release.I suppose the obvious thing to say about the Bond series is that its a stylized and gendered fantasy universe with almost no connection to the real world. But its never been quite that simple. Of course Sean Connerys iconic 007 of the 1960s was an idealized projection of maleness an object of narcissistic lust for preadolescent males first of all and only secondarily for women. He combined classic masculine characteristics of strength virility and stoicism with more feminine standards like style grooming and verbal wit; in many respects Connery-as-Bond was the grandfather of the metrosexual. There can be no doubt that he shaped the gender identity of an entire generation of boys; ""Goldfinger"" ""Dr. No"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (which inexplicably my friends and I decided was the best of them all) are closely linked in my memory with my first glimpses of my big brothers Playboy collection and the semiotics are about the same.You can probably explain a lot about the contemporary ""crisis of masculinity"" by tracing the Bond character through the decadent self-parody of the Roger Moore era the brief and underappreciated Timothy Dalton interregnum and the semi-renaissance under ironic imperturbable Pierce Brosnan. Lets leave that for someone elses doctoral dissertation and fast-forward to Craig who presents an earthier more physical 007 than any of his predecessors. Yes hes an actor who possesses unusual and ambiguous sexual power (employed to entertaining effect in ""Skyfall"") but Im actually talking about something more or something different. With his blocky physique short-cropped hair and tightly tailored clothing Craig feels connected to the stone and soil of Britain in a way no previous Bond has. Sure Craigs 007 can swill frou-frou cocktails with exotic beauties in a high-end Macao casino but hes arguably more comfortable on a London rooftop or a Scottish moor.In whats sure to be among the most discussed gender-studies moments of 2012 James Bond finds himself imprisoned on a devastated Chinese island by a nefarious character called Silva played by Javier Bardem as the first overtly gay villain in Bond history. Now the character of Silva is likely to be controversial on his own. I think hes intended to offer a new twist on the long and unfortunate cinematic history of gay male psychopaths - hes queeny and devious but also plenty skilled in the male-coded arts of warfare - but Im not sure that entirely lets Mendes and the writers off the hook. Anyway whether out of genuine desire or a desire to undercut 007s masculinity Silva slides up close to his bound antagonist and caresses his thighs ""Theres a first time for everything - eh Mr. Bond?"" But Bond meets his captors gaze with his customary implacability and asks ""What makes you think its my first time?""No Im not suggesting that director Sam Mendes or his writing team (John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) intend to raise serious questions about James Bonds sexual orientation or possible level of bi-curiosity. Its a gag but a gag with a purpose The ultimate secret-agent mans man is familiar with the concept of homosexuality and doesnt view it as a matter for snickering or an outright impossibility. Of such baby steps is a new society forged More seriously that moment captures the complicated dance the makers of ""Skyfall"" are trying to pull off situating James Bond in a more modern and slightly more realistic (or ""realistic"") context while holding onto his fantasy allure and remaining loyal to the ritualistic and episodic storytelling style thats integral to this series. You Might Also Like In ""Skyfall"" as in ""Casino Royale"" Craigs Bond is meant to seem more vulnerable more prone to human failings than the character has ever been before. We see him unshaven (with gray in his stubble) seriously wounded and/or seriously drunk out of shape and unable to pass a basic target-shooting test. Theres an obvious contradiction here since 100 percent of the potential audience knows that Bond is in practical terms an immortal character that he has as much chance of not surviving or not triumphing as Odysseus does of not reaching home at the end of the poem thats named after him. Yet Odysseus is made to suffer en route to his destination and so is Bond who faces a number of major losses in between the show-stopping action scenes (which are some of the best in series history).As hardcore fans already know Bonds past is linked to the landowning gentry of Scotland and his familys brooding ancestral manse actually becomes the climactic setting for ""Skyfall"" (featuring a nice cameo from Albert Finney as the crusty gamekeeper). Whether Mendes is really trying to add grit and dimension to Bonds story or just cramming in another cinematic reference - in this case to Alfred Hitchcocks espionage classic ""The 39 Steps"" which is also about a Scottish manhunt - is debatable. ""Skyfall"" is moody thrilling and for the most part beautifully made but like so much of contemporary action cinema its less like a story than a series of disconnected episodes drawn from a whole range of plots and genres but employing the same characters.Mind you a lot of those episodes are pretty doggone terrific and from the first seconds Mendes (best known for serious indie drama like ""American Beauty"" and ""Revolutionary Road"") makes clear that hes sticking closely to Bond formula and not arting up the thing too much. We begin with a dynamite opening chase sequence on the streets and rooftops of Istanbul and then atop a train into the Turkish countryside concluding with a surprise twist out of a classic Sherlock Holmes adventure (I wont say which one). While the plot is the usual MacGuffin-ish search for something or someone - in this case a hard drive that will reveal the identities of numerous British and American agents - the globetrotting quest packs in more film-school references to other movies than I could count including several other Bond pictures ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" (The technical work here is outstanding especially Roger Deakins cinematography.) Theres a tremendous fight sequence set inside a Shanghai skyscraper shot entirely in silhouette against a backdrop of ""Blade Runner""-scale digital billboards and another one in the aforementioned ultra-louche Macao casino involving a pair of giant carnivorous lizards. But ""Skyfall"" is also among the most conspicuously British of the Bond films a blend of Empire nostalgia and generational anxiety that features a devastating terrorist attack on the MI6 headquarters in London and the prospect that Judi Denchs M will be forced out by an officious Tory politician (Ralph Fiennes). As a brand-new wonder boy Q (Ben Whishaw) tells 007 the gadgetry of the past has been set aside in favor of ruthless efficiency. Which does not mean - spoiler alert - that you wont see that classic Aston Martin at some point.Honestly the convoluted plot surrounding Bardems dyed and spackled villain and the vague mood of ""Homeland""-style paranoia feel as incidental as Bonds come-and-go heterosexual liaisons. (Naomie Harris and French actress Berenice Marlohe offer the non-Craig eye candy.) ""Skyfall"" is a push-pull between the past and the present an effort to drag a symbol of maleness as iconic as the Union Jack bulldog on Ms desk into a world of approximate gender equality and approximate acceptance of sexual difference. Im not sure how sustainable that is over the long term; this is a smashing entertainment but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins. But if James Bonds definitely not going to get it on with a supervillain - especially not one with such execrable taste in shirts - he doesnt feel embarrassed about that thing that happened at Oxford that time.

"Skyfall 4.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Skyfall 4.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Skyfall Good to great 4.5 stars Director Sam Mendes. Cast Daniel Craig Judi Dench Javier Bardem. Rating PG-13 for intense violent sequences throughout some sexuality language and smoking. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 8 2012 1147 AM Its bittersweet to watch someone once so full of youth and vitality start to age to lose a step. Especially when he has a license to kill. ""Skyfall"" the latest in the 50 years worth of James Bond films finds Agent 007 not just aging physically but also as a kind of institutional relic at a time when a few strokes on a computer keyboard from an office in London can accomplish much of what he can (or so the bureaucrats would like to think). The echo of current-day debate over the value of on-the-ground spy work vs. anonymous high-tech intelligence is obvious and well-played. Its an interesting notion this idea that the man who so many times singlehandedly saved both Britain (and by extension the world) by being good with a gun better with women but mostly just cooler than everyone else might be slowing down. Director Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig returning for his third film as Bond hit this theme early and often and with exceptional skill. ""Skyfall"" has plenty of ridiculous chases and a few quips but more than anything else its an introspective personal entry in the Bond canon and one of the best. The requisite pre-credit chase scene ends with a cold reminder for Bond that he is a mere cog in the British intelligence game. Without giving too much away events conspire to make him question his fitness and value to the crown; if he needed any help Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) Ms boss is there to reinforce the point. M (played brilliantly again by Judi Dench) fares no better in Mallorys eyes. Its a young mans game he insists and both M and Bond begin to wonder whether hes right. Not to worry. Once yet another unhinged psychopath arrives on the scene both Bond and M know that Bonds way of doing business is the only way to bring the villain to justice. So put on the tux and grab a martini. Its time to save civilization again. The villain is a blond-haired nut job named Silva (Javier Bardem enjoying the lunatic complexities of the role so much that you cant help liking the guy no matter how evil he is). Hes a cyberterrorist who has among other things commandeered his own island. Silva has a personal grudge to settle which always is more fun. Im not sure Bond ever turns on a computer much less uses one; he leaves that to Q (Ben Whitshaw) a full-on nerd whose age and manner makes it hard for Bond to well bond with him. In Q Bond sees the future of MI-6 and he doesnt like the way it looks. There are many glances back in ""Skyfall"" including a spin in the beloved Aston Martin whose presence is both commented upon and lightly ridiculed. Its the perfect pitch and Mendes maintains it throughout. Screenwriters Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan even manage to work in a little of Bonds childhood -- thankfully not too much. Its no surprise that it will all come down to the modern way of doing things vs. the old-school way so much so that at one point Bond and his companions are practically fighting with muskets. The great success for Mendes and Craig however is that while ""Skyfall"" obviously has a great fondness for the past its not trapped there. It also anticipates Bonds future.

Slideshow Celebrating 50 Years of Bond Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Skyfall >> And then finally he comes into view becomes defined Craig. Daniel Craig. No extraterrestrial he. And so begins the 23d (official) James Bond extravaganza and the third with the steely Craig as Her Majestys super spy retooled for the gloom and doom of the new millennium but still licensed to kill. Directed by Sam Mendes with an Anglocentric bent that picks up where the London Olympics left off Skyfall returns to the city where Sean Connery dashed around with Daniela Bianchi in the second Bond film 1963s From Russia With Love Istanbul. Coincidentally thats the same city Liam Neeson dashes around in in the current Taken 2. In fact both Taken 2 and Skyfall boast rooftop chase sequences atop the Turkish capitals Grand Bazaar. (""Hey guys can you get a move on? We need this patch of tiles with that view of the mosque for our film"") If theres a theme in Skyfall (apart from John Barrys signature theme music that is) its to do with the conflict between old and new bodies in the field versus drones in the sky the need to keep an eye on history and an eye on your smartphone screen too. In a nicely written scene (John Logan who scripted Coriolanus for Ralph Fiennes is one of the three credited screenwriters) Bond and the new Q (tousle-haired lad Ben Whishaw) meet on a bench at Londons National Gallery facing Turners The Fighting Temeraire a seascape of a retired three-masted warship being hauled away for scrap by a steamer. When Bond realizes hes seated alongside MI6s quartermaster he cracks wise about his youth the ""spots"" on his face. ""Age is no guarantee of efficiency"" Q counters. ""And youth is no guarantee of innovation"" Bond quips. Age becomes an issue with M too. Bristling with gravitas Judi Dench who has played the agencys top gun since Goldeneye back in the last century has the bad luck to be in charge as the agencys computers are hacked its field agents outed and its Thames-side headquarters attacked with a terrorist bomb. Fiennes is Mallory Parliaments intelligence committee chairman and he pretty much demands Ms resignation. She refuses. The hacking and attacking its discovered - after Bond treks from Istanbul to London to Shanghai to Macau to some godforsaken isle and back to the U.K. - is the work of Silva (Javier Bardem) and a twisted soul is he. A disgruntled former MI6 bureau chief Silva sports a blond wig (and matching eyebrows) a lispy affect and a really big grudge. Im not sure whether its Bardems hammy performance or the way Silva has been cobbled together from bits of other cinema psychos (Hannibal Lecter anyone?) but as Bond villains go hes not terribly interesting. A sadistic sulky boy with really bad teeth. (The pitiful dentistry is explained.) Skyfalls opening and epic chase sequence is expertly choreographed its Bond girls are exotic (Berenice Marlohe) and empowered (Naomie Harris) and a final-act retreat to the Scottish highlands gives us a little Bond backstory introducing a bearded bearish old gent Kincade played with bully charm by the great Albert Finney (once a contender to be James Bond himself). With a clever nod to a missing Modigliani (Woman With a Fan) and Denchs recitation of Tennysons Ulysses (""We are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven"") Skyfall is certainly the most cultured Bond film to come along in some time. Its also the first of the three Craig endeavors to seriously (and wittily) acknowledge its pedigree. Theres even a ""shaken not stirred"" reference and the discovery of Bonds trusty Aston Martin DB5 tucked away in a garage. Yes the ejection seat still works.

Comments (12) click to enlarge Skyfall Recommended Free Video Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Rated PG-13  143 minutes  2012 The James Bond franchise turns 50 with a stellar entry that fires on all cylinders as an action picture but also casts a modest glance backward to its illustrious past. Oddly the story this time revolves around not 007 (Daniel Craig) but his aging superior M (Judi Dench) whos scrambling to keep her job after having lost a list of undercover agents to a simpering supervillain (Javier Bardem). The thrilling chase scene that opens the movie is cut short when M orders a kill shot that inadvertently takes out Bond; hes not really dead of course but hes plenty mad about having to take a bullet for queen country and his slipping boss. Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade knocking out their fifth consecutive Bond script keep the plot beautifully simple and leave director Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition) ample space to ponder the cost of loyalty and the power of tradition (including the Bond legacy itself).

In Theaters 11/9 Visit the official site at http//www.007.com Like us at http//www.facebook.com/JamesBond007 ""Skyfall"" the 23rd James Bond movie gives fans of the franchise everything they could hope for except perhaps a cryogenically revitalized Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is a worthy successor to the sexy Scotsman and ""Skyfall"" is the crown jewel of the Craig collection.In the cheeky-checklist of Bond-movie mainstays it starts with a pre-credit catastrophe. Bond (Craig) has tracked a leaked list of British secret agents to Istanbul where his train-top tussle with a Turkish terrorist leaves 007 missing and presumed dead.But as they say in the spy game you only live twice and Bond returns to London while a mysterious madman is decimating MI6. In the hunt for clues spymaster M (Judi Dench) and new gadget guru Q (Ben Whishaw) dispatch the rehabilitated Bond to Shanghai. Of course theres no real reason for the round-the-world detour except that China is a burgeoning film market with cool neon-lit skyscrapers where our hero can battle an assassin. That action sequence enacted in stylized silhouette is director Sam Mendes show-stopping solo before he relinquishes the spotlight to the able-bodied Craig and his colorful surroundings. In Macau Bond romances a rookie agent (Naomie Harris) and visits a casino where he gets to repeat his name order a shaken martini and wield a Walther PPK pistol in a span of 60 seconds. His golden gun impresses a femme fatale (Berenice Marlohe) who leads him to the island lair of our villain a rogue MI6 agent named Silva (Javier Bardem) who blames M for abandoning him to communist cutthroats years earlier.Silva is a flamboyant bad guy with blond locks and unresolved Oedipal issues and his homoerotic friction with Bond is a bold step forward for the franchise. But ultimately ""Skyfall"" is rooted in tradition -- and in British soil. A pastoral drive to Bonds boyhood home (in a kind of car that will delight purists) opens the gates to some psychological background and given the true-love subtext of ""Casino Royale"" its not surprising that theres an emotional payoff here. This new generation James Bond tries to be all things to all fans and blimey it succeeds. With spectacular action sequences a rock-solid star and a ration of cheese thats good English cheddar ""Skyfall"" is a gift from above.What ""Skyfall""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 223  Content Action violence mature language and some sexuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Starring Daniel Craig Judi Dench Ralph Fiennes Javier Bardem Helen McCrory Ben Whishaw Santi Scinelli Naomie Harris Albert Finney Ola Rapace Director Sam Mendes Running time 223 Release Opened Nov 8 2012  Editorial Review Bond elegantly goes back and forthBy Ann HornadayFriday November 9 2012One of the marks of a good director is the taste and judgment with which he deploys the most cherished tropes of the franchise hes in charge of extending. With ""Skyfall"" Sam Mendes proves to be just that adept reinvigorating the James Bond series with a sleek crisp classy installment exhibiting just the right proportion of respect for legacy and embrace of novelty. From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele its clear that ""Skyfall"" will be both classic and of-the-moment. Thanks to Mendes and the crackerjack team he has assembled James Bond proves once again that he can survive anything -- even ""Quantum of Solace."" To succeed of course a James Bond movie must traffic in equal parts sophistication and pure preposterousness a winking willingness not to take itself so very seriously but with writing acting and production values of the highest order. All of those elements are on hand in ""Skyfall"" which at the outset finds James (Daniel Craig) in Istanbul pursuing a bad guy through bazaars and over rooftops in a ludicrous motorcycle chase that at one point finds Bond making a wittily blase entrance into a moving train car. (Hes as good at nonchalantly shooting his cuffs as he is at shooting his Walther PPK.) That episode will somehow go all pear-shaped though sending Bond into something of an existential spiral bringing him alongside Jason Bourne and other au courant secret agents as people who are fighting not just shadowy forces of mass destruction but also their own inner demons. Eventually Bonds struggle will reach his relationship with M (Judi Dench) whose initial in ""Skyfall"" might as well stand for Martinet Mistress of All She Surveys and most of all Mother. When Bond flies into action after a self-imposed hiatus hes an Oedipal wreck bleary-eyed out of shape and visibly aging. (After 50 years and 22 films he has earned those creases and crevices.) Craig who made such a promising Bond debut in 2006s ""Casino Royale"" ably embodies a man feeling his age but still capable of looking awesome in a perfectly fitted tux. The not-so-sub-subtext of ""Skyfall"" is the ongoing dialogue between past and future whether its youth vs. age computers vs. analog or point-and-click terrorism vs. old-school geopolitics. There even seems to be an argument over the depiction of screen violence itself With its tidy bullet holes and pools of blood that look about as menacing as spilled milk ""Skyfall"" often plays like a reassuring rebuke against the graphic sadism that has invaded its cousins within the genre. That the visual language of ""Skyfall"" is so eloquent so readable can surely be credited at least in part to Roger Deakins the great cinematographer whose unerring eye gives the entire enterprise a cool subdued sheen. (London looks especially alluring through Deakinss silky lens.) Thats another welcome return to earlier adamantly un-frenetic style as are performances that hark back to the classic Bonds of yore when the villain inevitably greeted James with an understated ""Hello James"" and everyone delivered their dialogue with a perpetually arched eyebrow. Particularly good here are Craig and Dench (as always) but also Ralph Fiennes Javier Bardem the enchanting Naomie Harris as one of Bonds comelier MI6 colleagues and Ben Whishaw (currently on view in several roles in ""Cloud Atlas"") as Q who when he gives Bond a standard-issue gun and radio delivers one of several self-referential jokes. ""You were expecting an exploding pen?"" he quips. ""We dont really go in for that anymore."" Like everything else in ""Skyfall"" Whishaws new version of Q is both refreshing and comforting an ineffable mix that makes this piece of well-executed popcorn fluff satisfying on every level. Somehow Mendes and his writers (Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan) have managed to make a movie that is your fathers Bond but your teenaged kids too as he invites fans to bid goodbye to one or two beloved characters while making way for one or two new ones (or at least new old ones). As both an advance and a throwback ""Skyfall"" shows why good bones and artisanal values tend to endure. As one of ""Skyfalls"" most benevolent characters wisely opines just before he tries his hand at making a bespoke explosive device Sometimes the old ways are the best.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet James Bond films have always played loose with continuity but that hasnt stopped a sense of history from creeping into them. 2006s Casino Royale was supposed to mark a fresh start with a new 21st-century-ready Bond in the form of Daniel Craig plus a back-to-basics approach to big-screen spycraft. Apart from (smartly) keeping Judi Dench on as Bonds boss M it did just that but the haunted look in Craigs eyes and the mournful undertones of both that film and its successor Quantum Of Solace suggested the toll taken on those who toil in the fields of espionage too long. Helmed by American Beauty and Revolutionary Road director Sam Mendes--an unusual but effective choice--and arriving 50 years after Dr. No Skyfall turns up the volume of those undertones making Bonds tortured history a major theme finding a fragile humanity beneath the characters usually unshakable exterior of the sort not seen since George Lazenby broke down in tears at the end of On Her Majestys Secret Service. Skyfall doesnt forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all but from its first scene it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action. Stumbling into a mission gone wrong into Turkey Bond finds a badly wounded agent. He wants to stay and help but M tells him to pursue the enemy instead. After pausing briefly but noticeably he does what hes told. Then at the end of one of the most breathless opening sequences in the series another agent (Naomie Harris) does what M tells her to do leaving Bond in a position where others can assume hes dead. He isnt because that would make for a short movie. But he isnt entirely himself either and when hes drawn out of retirement by the actions of Javier Bardem--playing an embittered ex-agent who doubles as a dark reflection of what Bond might have and might still become--he isnt the same man anymore. The series has explored the idea of sending Bond off the grid before even as recently as Pierce Brosnans last cinematic take on the role in 2002s Die Another Day. But its never before taken him this far away from what weve come to recognize as James Bond. And Craig commits to the idea playing Bond for much of the film as a man almost too battered to do his job. Hes given a fitting antagonist in Bardem whose character has turned his skills toward nihilistic ends. A sociopath who could have long conversations with Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledgers Joker (with a sexual ambiguity that would make him seem like an old-fashioned evil-queen character if the script didnt let Craig defuse that possibility with one line) hes a terrifying opponent in a series thats offered up more than a few stock madmen. The script credited to the veteran Bond team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade and Gladiator writer John Logan seems keenly aware of the series history often zigging where past films have zagged particularly in a finale that bears no resemblance to past films traditional world-in-peril climaxes. But its also reverent of the films history drawing on elements of the characters past both on film and in Ian Flemings novels. (Berenice Marlohe plays a woman with a dark sexual past and a pure heart who seems torn from the pages of a book Fleming never wrote.) Its just as committed to taking the series places its never been before. That includes a daring approach to visuals and a plot that reveals pieces of Bonds past never spoken of before while stopping short of a true origin story. Whatever its other flaws Mendes Road To Perdition doubled as a textbook of striking cinematography. There as with American Beauty he worked with the late Conrad Hall. Here as with Revolutionary Road and Jarhead he collaborates with Roger Deakins the Coens go-to director of photography. The film looks striking from the beginning then gets more daringly expressionistic as it goes along building toward a gripping lyrical final sequence. The Bond films have always struggled to balance the expectations of a genre they created and the need to innovate to suit new political and cinematic climates. Skyfall more than rises to the challenge setting a new standard for modern Bond films while keeping an eye on the past--and considering the damage 50 years of restlessness gunplay and double lives must take on the soul.

Once Javiers character is captured it becomes a mess. Robert Tietjensaid on Friday December 07 2012 85946 AMJames Bond Is Dead Steven Freekinsaid on Wednesday November 21 2012 90338 PMI just saw the film and i thought it was great. The film is a little different than most traditional Bond films and it takes a contemporary approach to its story on how the enemy is everywhere now especially in the post 9/11 era we live in today. I think this is the best Bond film so far and it starts out with a great action sequence and then the story goes in a way that is similar to The Hunted (2003). It was worth the wait from the last Bond film four years ago. I cant wait for the next one. Kudos to director Sam Mendes. joesaid on Wednesday November 14 2012 120937 AMEntertaining but from the point where javier bardem shows up to the conclusion of the movie I felt like I was watching the Dark Knight. Whether it was bardem looking like heath ledger acting like him or that alfred-like caretaker at the old orphanage or just the feel and tone and action sequences toward the end mixed with the lack of style and subtely that supposedly signature Bond movies I did not feel like I was treated to the bond franchise at the end.

I spy some cool James Bond stuff exhibits etc. to get you ready for Skyfall For its first quarter or so Skyfall moves along with workmanlike efficiency a somber portrait of 007 (the third go-round for Daniel Craig) shaken by a brush with mortality and stirred back into action. Then Javier Bardem shows up as a sneering peroxided baddie and the whole movie leaps up another level to a place that transcends the franchise.This isnt just a case of Bardem being terrific though he certainly is. His character a preening former MI6 operative named Silva brings the whole story into focus and gives Skyfall a sense of consequence that surpasses even the tragic overtones of Craigs first Bond outing Casino Royale. The movie makes a claim that cant be matched by many Bond films Its actually about something.You could (but I wont) argue that Bond movies arent supposed to be about anything. Cartoonish villains fancy gadgets the adolescent allure of a superspy who sleeps with whatever babe he chooses. These are the defining markers of the Bond tradition that have helped make so many of the movies indistinguishable from one another regardless of whos filling the suit.The franchise deserves a dry martini on the house for realizing the old rules no longer apply. Yes theres still plenty of action and an exotic Bond girl (Berenice Marlohe) and even a certain Aston Martin that had the faithful squealing with delight at a recent preview screening. But such familiar trappings take a back seat to a thorny story about means and ends the burden of power and a tough Machiavellian old broad (Judi Denchs divine M) with blood on her hands.See M left Silva out to dry years back much as she makes Bond expendable during the movies slam-bang opener and the rogue agent feels betrayed as only a wronged son can. He scoffs at MI6 as he engineers a series of terrorist attacks; Bardem has more than enough range charm and timing to make a bad guy funny. But when the subject is M the surrogate mom who abandoned him on the job he flashes a feral hunger for vengeance. He wants his mommy. To die. Silva is the best movie villain since well Bardem in No Country for Old Men.There was plenty of hand-wringing when Sam Mendes was announced as the director of Skyfall (the title was met with a fair share of abuse as well). Too arty cried the naysayers. Too serious. But Mendes pulls off quite a balancing act here. He offers red meat and fleet clever references for those who dont leave the couch during Bond cable TV marathons. He knows hes been entrusted with a legacy.But instead of letting that legacy define Skyfall hes made a smart grown-up action movie with strong thematic echoes of the Bourne and Dark Knight movies. Theres even a new Q played with hyperfocused nerd power by Ben Whishaw and another fresh-faced agent played by Naomie Harris whose identity wont be spoiled here.By the time Bond and M take refuge in Bonds dark old family mansion on the Scottish moors overseen by a crusty Albert Finney you realize how radically Mendes and Co. have departed from expectations. Skyfall isnt quite a reboot but its mix of tortured soul and high table stakes feels bold and new -- no easy feat for a 50-year-old property.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.SKYFALL(A-) Directed by Sam Mendes.

Six years ago in Casino Royale Daniel Craigs first outing as Bond we learned that 007 owes his perpetual bachelor status to the loss of true love Eva Green. Skyfall Craigs third Bond film again aims to flesh out the backstory of the spy with the globe-trotting terrorist hunt this time literally revisiting the site of the childhood trauma that apparently pushed Bond to seek out that license to kill through which he has funneled a love of country bordering on psychosis. Also unearthed the deep-seated parental issues that have caused him to cling to MI6 adviser M (Judi Dench).This time around the signature spectacular pre-credits chase sequence atop a moving train ends with Bond in the crosshairs of a fellow agent played by Naomie Harris. (Despite the euphemism-heavy workplace seduction that develops with Bond her characters throwback-punchline name isnt revealed until the final scenes.) She shoots and misses; the bad guy she aimed to kill escapes carrying a digital drive holding the names of dozens of undercover NATO agents while Bond falls off a bridge and goes missing. Back in London M works on Bonds obituary while the spy himself takes advantage of his presumed death to cash in some Ramp;R on a tropical island catching up on his drinking and anonymous-woman-fucking. Then MI6 headquarters is bombed a simultaneous cyber attack reveals that the stolen drive has fallen into the worst hands possible and Bond reports for duty toting a piece of shrapnel/evidence in his pec that gives MI6 a head start on smoking out the enemy.Bopping from Shanghai to Macao Bond gets up to the usual daring escapes and zipless nightcaps but the peak of the movie is his tete-a-tete confrontation with Silva (Javier Bardem) a former disciple of M turned killer hacker who we learn went rogue after bad shit went down during the Hong Kong handover. A catty dandy whose own evil owes to grievous PTSD Silva taunts Bond about the ""unresolved childhood trauma"" that turned him into 007 material. In Skyfall even the Bond villain is obsessively determinist.Film Details Skyfall RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time143 More Info Trailer The greatest gift director Sam Mendes--working with cinematographer Roger Deakins--brings to the material is staging and imagery that artfully amplify the films ideas about the world in which all of this is happening. And there are ideas despite the fetishism and improbability native to the franchise. Bonds world is undeniably modeled after a real one engaged in debates about transparency and obfuscation in which established institutions find themselves crippled (and perhaps worse rendered foolish) by stateless entities who show their power through violent interruptions of both the physical and virtual worlds. A bureaucrat played by Ralph Fiennes trying to drag MI6 kicking and screaming into the age of Anonymous contends that the agency ""cant keep working in the shadows--there are no shadows."" Its a POV contested by the films most visually stunning action scene a relatively simple duel in a darkened Shanghai skyscraper with Bond and the bad guy silhouetted against the neon lights and building-enveloping video billboards outside. The shadows might have changed shape location and method of generation but the conflicts seem to be as binary as theyve ever been.Skyfalls most pressing project is to prove that Bond a thoroughly 20th-century invention can function in the new media landscape on-screen and off. From the undisguised camp of the Silva/Bond confrontation to the nods to past 007 films and rhetoric endorsing ""the old methods"" the freshest thing about Skyfall is its embrace of its own old-fashioned values. Its a movie in which the villains secret weapon is a server farm in which the high-tech gizmos proffered by the new hipster Q (Ben Whishaw) are quickly discarded for old-school tools. In the body of 43-year-old visibly graying Craig Bonds advancing age is played as both an obstacle to surmount and a virtue. Between the action sequences the pleasure lies in observing impeccably dressed Brits exchanging barbed witticisms--making it basically Downton Abbey with cyber crime and shower sex.But as much as its open about its paranoia of the new Skyfalls fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends. Like this summers Spider-Man Batman and Avengers movies Skyfall seems to exist primarily to set up the events of subsequent films. At nearly two and a half hours long its the September issue of Bond movies bloated with story to fill out the spaces between product placements with much of that story lardy psychological exposition--even the enigmatic title turns out to be key to Bonds formative sads. Skyfall pays lip service to embracing 007s unique tradition while actively attempting to reposition Bond as a kind of cousin to caped crusaders another loner orphaned man-child who kills the few to protect the many all because he misses his mommy.

"Movie review Skyfall shows James Bond still sharp and fit at 50 - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Skyfall shows James Bond still sharp and fit at 50 Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic If ""Skyfall"" is the new 50 James Bond is handling it remarkably well. Five decades after the first cinematic incarnation of 007 novelist Ian Flemings agent provocateur the spy-craft in the new film is sharper the intrigue deeper the beauties brighter (more brain less bare).And yet if Im not mistaken there are perilous emotional peaks and valleys along with all that bloody cheek. Daniel Craigs Bond is not quite as detached his martini not quite as dry. Even the villain a masterfully menacing Javier Bardem is an emotional wreck whose angst is actually explored. Indeed the entire film is shrink-wrapped in self-examination that somehow manages not to dint much less destroy the explosive fun. Just how does one get in touch with ones inner assassin -- sanctioned or not? Try putting an introspective auteur in the directors chair. Sam Mendes the maker of such suburban dysfunction as ""American Beauty"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" has upped the ante the action and the artistry in ""Skyfall"" without losing all the defining traits weve come to expect -- and need -- from Bond. Not just the well-cut tux so perfect for slipping into fashionable soirees that villains inhabit but the most essential pillar of all things Bondian -- that the very fate of the free world rides on one mans ability to beat impossible odds and save the day.PHOTOS James Bond through the years Mendes has a good blueprint to work with. Screenwriters John Logan Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have Bond (Craig) M (Judi Dench) and the rest of MI6 facing a cold war being waged uncomfortably close to home. There is nothing more dangerous than the enemy within and M in particular is left dodging Parliaments salvos and new intelligence chief Gareth Mallorys questions (nicely downplayed by Ralph Fiennes).There are a lot of dicey moves for M to make after the disaster of a mission in Turkey which opens the film in fierce fashion (following another Bond touch a particularly elegant graphic opening credit sequence accompanied by a sure-to-be-a-smash title song by Adele). A compromising list of secret agents has somehow gotten into the wrong hands. M wants it back at all costs. And the cost will be high -- a shocking death and implications that will ripple through the film.The splashy gadgets that are a Bond tradition are few. Instead the film is framed by the high-tech age of satellite communication and cyber bullies. Agent Q (Ben Whishaw) is an electronics genius with plenty of nerdy quirks intellectual arrogance chief among them. But hes a good ally in tracing the shadowy cyber trail of the films arch archenemy Silva (Bardem going bad bottle-blond for Bond). Silvas got a wicked sense of humor as well as a carefully refined sadistic streak that keeps the body count climbing. But it is what drives Silva to such deadly extremism that makes the movie interesting.PHOTOS James Bonds top 10 villains In a ties-that-bind twist that casts M in an entirely new light ""Skyfall"" takes a good deal of time digging into her motives and methods. The decision a good one keeps Dench front and center and M tart and tested until the bitter end. Mendes proves quite facile in using the acting assets he has at his disposal to maximum effect. Bardem is easy to despise. Naomie Harris as Bonds sometime partner Eve provides a welcome bit of sass and Berenice Marlohe as the beauty caught in the mess stops short of sliding into sex-object territory.But the weight of carrying the film falls to Craig. The good news is that hes even more comfortably settled in than his first two outings -- 2006s ""Casino Royale"" and 2008s ""Quantum of Solace."" Craigs always been a craggier Bond more solid and serious than Sean Connery who initially gave James a sly wry elegance a tone that was largely continued by the Bonds that would follow. Craigs shaken it up again here. His James is angrier and more haunted by indecision in ""Skyfall."" The emotional charges buried under all that stoicism add another layer of tension to an already teasingly tense film.While many of the ideas are high-tech much of the action superbly shot by Roger Deakins is anything but. Trains of both the high-speed and metro type are running through the film. Bonds classic Aston Martin turns up as does his messy childhood. All that digging around in the past works flawlessly at times -- as when an old father figure turns up in the form of Albert Finney -- with the occasional bad patch quickly dispensed with. PHOTOS The Bond girlsThough ""Skyfall"" begins in Turkey and spends some quality time in Shanghai most of the anxiety and action is unspooling on the home front -- strategic London bombings a beyond-belief subway ride and a country home in Scotland where everything (metaphorically at least) blows up. Scarier and more to the point of things we have come to fear most the bad guys are able to plot a path of destruction with extraordinary precision -- and complete anonymity. Its a conspiracy of shadows using social media -- a YouTube sensibility gone rogue where targets can be mocked and kills get their 15 minutes of fame. In ""Skyfall"" Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air -- which really makes him the hero of this saga. Saving Bond after all is rather like saving the day.---MPAA rating PG-13 for intense violent sequences throughout some sexuality language and smokingRunning time 2 hours 25 minutesPlaying In general releaseALSOKeeping 007 relevant in a changed world""Skyfall"" debuts at No. 1 in 25 foreign countriesAre James Bond and Jason Bourne melding together?betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Skyfall Daniel Craig Media Industry Human Interest Turkey James Bond 007s top 10 villains Listen James Bond songs by British artists Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-skyfall-review-james-bond-20121108,0,6113916.story",200,skyfall27,skyfall,latimes

Both sides of Craigs 007 get a full workout in ""Skyfall"" which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Bond franchise by mixing new twists with just enough shout-outs to please the nostalgic among us. Even if the Bond series has lasted this long through an adherence to a fairly strict formula -- nefarious villain cool gadgets Bond sleeps with several women one of whom always dies -- ""Skyfall"" dares to play around with the structure a bit paying more attention to character than usual and providing a villain who is both over-the-top and psychologically damaged in a recognizably human way. That villain would be Silva (Javier Bardem) whos been nursing a decades-long grudge against M (Judi Dench) for reasons that arent immediately apparent. His scheme against her begins with having a minion steal a disc with information about MI6 and its agents a theft that puts him in the line of fire of Bond and fellow field operative Eve (Naomie Harris). Bond and Silvas henchman fight atop a moving train in Turkey (as one does) and M orders Eve to take a shot at them that apparently hits Bond and sends him hurtling off a high bridge into a river. Hes happy to be thought dead until a terrorist attack organized by Silva destroys MI6 forcing the bureau to relocate underground in one of Churchills old bunkers. While M faces tough questions from PM Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and an inquiry committee Bond and Eve go after Silva. Casino fights sex in a shower and highly explosive showdowns ensue. If on paper this sounds like business as usual for 007 ""Skyfall"" feels like anything but from the intelligent and jaunty script by John Logan (""Hugo"" ""Rango"") and Bond vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade to the sure hand of director Sam Mendes working as far outside of his previous wheelhouse as one might imagine. When it comes to mixing pyrotechnics and character development Mendes appears to be on much surer footing here than with ""Jarhead."" (And thankfully miles away from the histrionics of ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""American Beauty."") Having the great Roger Deakins onboard as cinematographer certainly helps capturing everything from the high-tech sheen of intelligence headquarters to the autumnal shadows of a moldering country estate. Three movies in Craig is James Bond whether youre on board or not and hes managed to make the character less of an action figure and more a real person; if you prick him he does indeed bleed and theres a feeling that Craigs Bond can demonstrate actual empathy without compromising 007s ruthlessness. But this is the rare film in which it feels like hes got a supporting ensemble rather than just bit players along for the ride. This is probably the most M weve ever gotten in a Bond flick and Dench turns it into a showcase while the rest of the cast -- from Harris and Fiennes to Ben Whishaw as the new Q (gadgets are a young mans game after all) -- gives their relatively brief appearances memorable heft as well. With the film placing Bond into a realistically modern world of politics and terrorism this crew helps place Her Majestys Secret Service into a context that makes Bond seem as relevant to life post-9/11 as he once was to the Cold War. And then theres Bardem; not the first Oscar-winner to play a Bond villain (that would be Christopher Walken in ""A View to a Kill"") but he definitely takes the whole bad-guy thing to a new level. Hes not out to rule the world or corner the gold market; he just wants revenge on M and his mania is palpable throughout. Theres also been no one of the many psychopaths who have tied James Bond to a chair who has lifted the gay/Samp;M subtext of these movies up into the text. Rather than feel gimmicky or extraneous however the crazy vibe that emerges between the two plays out like the culmination of a long-simmering undercurrent for the whole series. Lest old school Bond-philes feel left out however Mendes wisely throws in a music cue here a car there that offer a twinge of recognition for the legions of fans worldwide who have kept the series afloat all these years. Those inside jokes remind us where the character has been and the rest of the film -- among the franchises best ever -- offers hope that there are enough new and under explored facets of James Bond to make him viable for another 50 years on the big screen.

Colin Covert says yes. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Skyfall"" is a mixed bag. Some of it is terrific. And some of it is spectacular. The story kicks off with a ruthlessly exciting curtain raiser. A quick blast of Monty Normans musical theme and were off on a nail-biting car/motorcycle/train chase that ends with Bond accidentally shot by a fellow agent his body lost in a raging Turkish river and left for dead. He re-emerges in London following a bomb attack that cripples MI-6. But with gray in his stubble and a quiver in his gun hand hes damaged goods. When an antagonist tauntingly asks his hobbies Bond snarls ""resurrection."" You wonder if hes trying to convince himself. Theres no question that ""Skyfall"" restores the Bond saga to life. This is the film the series has been building toward since its melancholy more realistic reboot in ""Casino Royale."" With a nod to the series 50th anniversary there are references to earlier films. Thankfully those timeline-twisting asides are more sardonic than campy. ""Skyfall"" also pauses to consider whether a hands-on spy is obsolete in the cyber age when a clever lad with a laptop can create more havoc than a double-0 agent with a license to kill. With director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"") at the helm the action scenes are breathtakingly executed and the obligatory casino visits and seductions shimmer with glamour. Mendes has a dazzling talent for imagery. Working with virtuoso cinematographer Roger Deakins he gives us numerous scenes of figures in darkened silhouette. Bonds death battle with an assassin framed against the swirling plasma-screen light-works of Shanghais night sky gorgeously evokes the shadow world of espionage. Mendes is also a top-rank director of actors. He gave Daniel Craig his first sizable serious role as an unstable gangland heir in ""Road to Perdition."" Here Craig repays the favor with an iconic performance. With due respect to Sean Connery the 007 mantle has been passed. In his third outing as Britains indispensable superspy Craig makes the character his own. His James Bond is as cunning courageous carnal and existentially cool as any weve seen. Hes also fallible. He mourns fallen colleagues bleeds when shot suffers the punishing physical and spiritual pangs of life as a middle-aged government hit man. Francois Duhamel Associated Press - Ap Daniel Craig is James Bond in the action adventure film ""Skyfall."" The script delivers breakneck action without sacrificing sharp intelligence. Alongside the thrills there are scenes of healing to give the audience the chance to reflect that violence however necessary carries a cost. All the characters behave plausibly given the exaggerated world they inhabit with personal motivations guiding their actions rather than abstract villainy and one-dimensional heroism. The measure of a Bond adventure is often the stature of the villain. Here the nemesis is Silva (disturbingly blond Javier Bardem) a flamboyant sociopath who probably tears the wings off butterflies when hes not bombing the headquarters of MI-6. The cyber-terrorist is a renegade agent with deep bitter scores to settle not a Dr. Evil abstraction. Bardems freon-cold smile is intimidating enough but a scene where he comes to resemble a monster from one of Goyas nightmare paintings is genuinely unsettling. By turns brilliant insinuating playful and warped but always lethal he is the top Bond foe to date. The beauties -- Naomie Harris as a rookie British field agent and Berenice Marlohe as the villains kept woman -- get rather short shrift. Its Ms Judi Dench who receives most of Bonds attention and the movies. A third act that probes Bonds origins finally gives us the back story that explains his unswerving loyalty to his bureaus chief and his ability to absorb and mete out awful punishment. The film holds out many surprises in its finale and some breathtaking emotional beats. Delivering all the kinetic satisfaction of a taut action thriller with a mature sophistication rare in popcorn blockbusters ""Skyfall"" packs a punch like a Walther PPK 9mm. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186  Twitter colincovert ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The big question the pessimists are asking about Skyfall the 23rd entry in the James Bond franchise Does 007 still have a license to keep an audience alert? The answer And how Some of the exhilaration faded when Sean Connery lost his hair and took a powder but 50 years after Ian Flemings super-cool agent from Her Majestys Secret Service was shot from a cannon into movie history Bond is back and so is high-octane entertainment. Skyfall may not reach the sophisticated heights of Casino Royale but its better than the lollygagging Quantum of Solace.With buff camera-ready Daniel Craig lending fresh fisticuffs to the role and acclaimed director Sam Mendes adding more realism and fewer jokes than in most Bond pictures its a satisfying entertainment that delivers a kangaroo kick from start to finish. Despite the less showy Saul Bass-inspired titles and a stupid theme song behind the credits screeched by Adele (""We will stand tall and face it all/You may have my number but youll never have my heart"") that reminds us all how much we owe to Shirley Bassey Skyfall signifies a new 007 style. The series is beyond gimmickry now. You just look at the toys try to follow the plot and count the bikinis. But the best thing about Skyfall is the way it maximizes the great Judi Dench as M. Its her best outing in the series to date and she chews it like taffy. With six you get eggroll but with vibrant chromatic cinematography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption) anda distinguished assembly of supersonic talents headed by Javier Bardem Ralph Fiennes Ben Whishaw and Albert Finney--you get box office platinum. The film opens with the obligatory chase--007 wrecking an entire bazaar in Istanbul scaling rooftops on a motorcycle and destroying as many civilians buildings and moving vehicles as possible cars that never run out of gasoline on roads that never end posing no threat to maintenance. Bond is knocked off the top of a speeding train into roaring rapids and plunges over a waterfall. When the dust settles a plot emerges; M loses her computer hard-drive and on it a file containing the name of every NATO agent in the worlds terrorist zones. Hackers then unleash cyber attacks on secret service headquarters in London. Bond is believed dead M is threatened with dismissal and the series seems in danger of grinding to a halt. When Bond resurfaces M snarls through clenched teeth ""You know the rules of the game. Youve been playing it long enough."" Which means no loyalty no apologies and anything goes. While he was enjoying some badly needed R and R and taking a shower with sexy Berenice Marlohe the bombed-out secret service relocated its headquarters to an underground bunker used by Churchill during the Blitz. Bonds unlikely new quartermaster is a wimpy fop named Q (Ben Whishaw) who dispatches him to Shanghai to locate and liquidate the thief who is using Ms files to destroy the world. The mega-villain is an epicene bottle-blond fiend played with exotic pansexual delight by Javier Bardem. A renegade agent who used to work for M hes droll cynical and seductive. In the films funniest scene he straps Bond to a chair runs his hands lasciviously across his crotch and hisses ""Theres a first time for everything."" Good ol 007 unfazed counters with ""How do you know its the first time?"" The movie moves from a casino in Macao approachable only by boat and surrounded by giant man-eating Komodo dragons to an endangered London tube station at rush hour to a hunting lodge in Scotland where M gets a chance to show off some of her own operative training. Mr. Bardem munches a lot of whatever scenery is still standing and Dame Judi employs her icy blue eyes and matching steel reserve with terrifying authority. Bond is floppier and less buttoned-down than usual; hes given up smoking and the psychology of his traumatic background is explored for the first time. Bond relies less on naked girls and state-of-the-art gadgets than before but as played by Daniel Craig hes both a teddy bear and as rugged as ever. So much so in fact that when his trusty old Aston Martin makes an appearance at last the audience bursts into applause. Like the pieces of an elaborate jigsaw everything falls perfectly into place and there is overwhelming evidence that James Bond will rise again. Is there life after Skyfall?

A foreign locale. A high-speed chase ending in a spectacular stunt. And then the titles played out against sinuous silhouettes and a brassy song by a current pop star. Yes James Bond is back. But - different. Its partly a function of whos new here (director Sam Mendes who usually does theater and more ""serious"" films; co-writer John Logan who also worked on ""Gladiator"" and ""The Aviator""). And its a function of whos returning - Daniel Craig doing his third Bond Judi Dench playing bossy M for the seventh time. Mostly though I think its a result of how long the series has been away and whats happened in the meantime. The latest 007 re-boot got off to a good start with ""Casino Royale"" in 2006 but slacked off with ""Quantum of Solace"" in 2008. Then MGM ran into money troubles. The next movie was delayed - and in that span pictures like ""Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol"" beat Bond at his own game with even more exotic locales crazier action sequences. And so ""Skyfall"" goes back to the old rules. What Mendes and the rest have done is smartly re-set the Bond clock all the way back to 1963 or so before the wild gadgets and ever-more-improbable plots took over. Theres nobody here crying tears of blood no missions in space no woman with a double-entendre name. Just one man out to get M. Another determined to protect her. And two hours or so of cat and mouse. The problem of course with doing away with all the distractions is - theres nothing to distract you. Not from Daniel Craigs fairly flat performance as a grizzled slightly sub-par hero. Nor from Javier Bardems sometimes too-giddy turn as the fey flirtatious villain (he occasionally seems to be auditioning for ""Kiss of the Spider Woman II""). The good thing is though youre also forced to focus on other often overlooked qualities that ran through Ian Flemings original novels but the movies often neglected. Like the emotional relationship between M (beautifully played by Dench) and her most troublesome agent. Like the one between Bond and the service he both defends and sometimes feels betrayed by. And like London itself - a major player this time (although there are plenty of Chinese locations probably cynically to shore up the films foreign sales). ""Skyfall"" occasionally falters by failing to provide some of the other things besides outrageous eye-candy weve come to expect from the films. Taken for granted even. Adeles opening song is dull the vocals too full of treble. The plot isnt perfectly worked out and seems to spring less from logic than logistics - how do we get Character A to Point B? But the stripped-down slightly grittier feel of the movie carries us along - and perhaps even announces a direction for the series thats both new to young fans and as old as ""From Russia With Love."" The Bond series it seems is finally actually ceding some of the truly outrageous stuff to the other spy franchises and saying go ahead take the spectacle. Weve got the characters (and the ending suggests the return of even a few more old favorites in new guises). As per tradition of course the credits promise ""James Bond Will Return."" But Id say he already has. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations violence and strong language. Skyfall (PG-13) Columbia (143 min.) Directed by Sam Mendes. With Daniel Craig Javier Bardem.

"Skyfall review Falling for James Bond all over again | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSkyfall review Falling for James Bond all over againDaniel Craigs old spy dog discovers new tricks in Skyfall the 23rd official James Bond film that seems as fresh as the first. It gloriously incorporates tradition with innovation in gratifying ways.No mere Bond Girl Naomie Harris is memorable as agent Eve opposite Daniel Craigs beseiged 007 in Skyfall.  (Francois Duhamel / MGM)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 7 2012Skyfall (out of 4)Starring Daniel Craig Javier Bardem Judi Dench Naomie Harris Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw. Directed by Sam Mendes. 142 minutes. Opens Nov. 8 at major theatres. PGSkyfall the splendid new James Bond movie contains so many references to aging and decrepitude its as if the 50-year-old franchise were drawing to a close.Yet the 23rd official Bond seems as fresh as the first incorporating tradition with innovation in gratifying ways.Article Continued Below""Old dog new tricks"" a comely character says prompting a smile of agreement.Skyfall somehow feels like an origin film even as Adeles title tune recalls past glories and martinis arrive properly shaken. Perhaps the better word is recalibration for Daniel Craigs 007 era that began so smartly with Casino Royale and then foundered with the incomprehensible Quantum of Solace.Craig has renewed purpose in his third stint as Bond even as his wounded and besieged Agent 007 begins to feel the calendars cruel accounting. Hes aided in this balancing act by director Sam Mendes a series newcomer who brings a stage dramatists rich sense of character development to the guns girls and gadgets world of Bond James Bond.The writing is another big plus credited to old Bond hands Neal Purvis and Robert Wade with an assist from Hugo scenarist John Logan. The story digs into Bonds complex psyche deeper than any previous film has dared go.Change is coming for Her Majestys most resilient spy. There are shakeups at British espionage agency MI6 with its London HQ coming under terrorist fire and Bonds boss M (Judi Dench) being drawn into the fray.Indeed the entire British Empire is under attack from Raul Silva a rogue ex-MI6 agent and digital demon who is bent on revenge and mayhem. Played with just the right amount of leering menace by Javier Bardem he taunts Bonds loyalties as antiquated thinking.""Just look at you"" he says making an entrance that Mendes brilliantly frames and paces. ""Chasing spies. England. The Empire. MI6. So old-fashioned""Skyfall also finds humour in youthful arrogance with Craig more finely in tune with Bonds sarcastic side. An amusing sequence sets 007 in an art museum gazing upon The Fighting Temeraire William Turnersclassic painting of a ruined Trafalgar warship. He exchanges quips about aging with a boyish new Q (Ben Whishaw) who views Bond as a relic from the pre-computer age useful only when ""a trigger has to be pulled"" in the analog world.""Or not pulled"" Bond rejoins finishing the thought with a delicious zinger.For once a 007 movie has a threat that is at once more understandable and more complex than the usual world-domination schemes of colourful madmen. Bardems Silva has obtained a computer drive containing a list of NATO officials who are secretly embedded with worldwide terrorist organizations. His plan is to expose five of them at a time on YouTube putting many lives at risk and destroying the work of global security agencies.Bond must stop him but is he up to the job? An early chase scene in Istanbul which thrillingly recalls the parkour start of Casino Royale leaves huge question marks as to 007s whereabouts commitment and physical stamina.Officious senior civil servant Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) doubts whether Bond is the right man for fast-moving times. When M protests Mallory dismisses her as ""sentimental"" ands suggests she should consider retirement voluntarily or otherwise.""Sentimental"" is not the first word that comes to mind when appraising Denchs steely performance. Her relationship with Bond is that of both scold and supporter nuances she is finally given enough screen time to explore.Skyfall lands well for all the ladies of the cast.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures Francois Duhamel) <<1234>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers The Details Lincoln Sister Skyfall Skyfall The IMAX Experience This Must Be the Place Interviews with the stars hot new trailers In an early scene in ""Skyfall"" an aging M angrily turns to James Bond and says ""You know the rules of the bloody game. Weve played it long enough.""Replies a battered and psychologically scarred Bond ""Maybe too long.""""Skyfall"" is the 23rd film in the franchises 50-year history and at times it has felt that indeed this spy game has gone on for too long. There have certainly been attempts at the tricky proposition of bringing Bond into the modern world while still keeping all those elements that have made it one of the most successful film series ever. It worked with 2006s ""Casino Royale"" (the first to star Daniel Craig); not so much with 2008s ""Quantum of Solace.""But with ""Skyfall"" it turns out that there is still a lot of life in the world of 007. Once again starring Craig and directed by Sam Mendes (not anyones first choice to direct an action flick) this is a brilliant reboot of the canon mixing a sense of melancholy the shock of changing times and the darkness of loss with thrillingly staged chase and fight scenes and clever references to all that has come before.On one hand there is the car (yes the iconic Aston Martin makes an appearance) the tuxedo the casino scene the exotic locales the gorgeous women and Adeles shimmering sexy title song. But it is all underlined by the changing nature of the spy game with danger coming from cyberterrorists who truly live in the shadows a game driven not so much by country or political beliefs but by revenge retribution and resurrection.Advertisement Keeping with the requirements of a Bond movie ""Skyfall"" opens with a spectacular chase. Its a particularly gripping one through and over the rooftops of Istanbuls Grand Bazaar and onto a hurtling train eventually involving Land Rovers motorcycles and oh yes a Caterpillar backhoe. But the end sends us tumbling into a darker place.The chase is one of several set pieces that are flat-out dazzling to behold. Mendes (""American Dream"" ""Road to Perdition"") was savvy enough to sign up the extraordinary cinematographer Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"" Mendes ""Revolutionary Road"") to take on the varied looks that are part of ""Skyfall."" A fight between Bond and a hit man in a Shanghai skyscraper is a thing of beauty all color and neon. The final showdown at Bonds ancestral home in the Scottish Highlands is a grim gritty affair set in an imposing landscape.The smart witty script is credited to Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan although it seems largely the work of Logan a playwright (""Red"") who has worked all manner of film genres from the animated ""Rango"" to ""Gladiator"" and ""Star Trek Nemesis"" with considerable skill. No matter who is most responsible it is a meaty bit of writing with more emotional weight than has been traditional in a Bond film.Craig has evolved into arguably the best Bond ever (and reportedly deserves the credit for convincing a reluctant Mendes to direct). He is just terrific as a spy on the edge of a new far more complicated era. His performance is matched by that of Judi Dench as M. Dench has been playing the part since ""Goldeneye"" in 1995 but for the first time gets to really delve into the psyche of a driven spymaster who is on the verge of being pushed into retirement.Ralph Fiennes has a nice turn as Ms new boss who thinks her time is up. Ben Whislaw (""Cloud Atlas"") gives an amusingly subtle performance as the new (and much younger) Q now more computer whiz than weapons expert. Naomie Harris from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flashes some sexual pop (and a lot of brains) as one of Bonds fellow agents.And then theres Javier Bardem (""No Country for Old Men"") as this films Big Bad Silva a cyberterrorist and former MI6 agent with a score to settle. He is truly scary a brilliant psychopath Bardem makes even more frightening with a witty performance that recalls Heath Ledger as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" In recent days there has been some buzz about ""Skyfall"" being a possible Oscar contender. That probably wont happen because the Academy has a hard time with some genres of film. But it should be in the conversation. ""Skyfall"" is that good.Follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.skyfall    1/2Rating PG-13 (for violence sexuality and language)Cast Daniel Craig Javier Bardem Judi Dench and Ralph FiennesDirector Sam MendesRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

OK it maybe more in common with the Bourne Identity than Roger Moores comedic Bond but the franchise is no worse for it. From the outset the film separates itself from the previous incarnations as the new Bond establishes his first kills and thus the start of his 00 career. Mads Mikkelsen establishes himself as one of Bonds best villains and Eva Green as an excellent Bond girl clever attractivefeisty and sensitive. The scene in the shower where Bond goes to comfort her shows how much more grown up the storyline is to previous offerings as it also offers up other facets to the Bond persona. Then we have one of the best torture scenes as Le Chiffre swings the rope. The ending as Lynd drowns is truly sad but sets the scene for the following film.

"Skyfall | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; skyfall ) Skyfall (United Kingdom 2012) November 06 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Skyfall can take its place alongside From Russia with Love Goldfinger and On Her Majestys Secret Service as the best Bond can offer. With an Oscar winner at the helm and Oscar winners in two prominent roles Skyfall overflows with talent but as always its the man with the tux and the Walther PPK that makes the difference. With his piercing blue eyes Daniel Craig saunters into this endeavor to his rousing two-note introduction with confidence. Now eight years and three movies into his tenure Craig has gotten through the teething stage that was Quantum of Solace and has found his stride. Hes the best Bond since Connery and thats perhaps because theres so much of the first 007 in his performance. Gone is the silliness that defined Roger Moores period and the superhero dimension that enfolded Brosnan. Although Skyfall spends equal time looking back and setting up the future it never loses sight of the present and in the process gives us the best 007 adventure in more than four decades. Sam Mendes gleeful at the opportunity to helm an entry into the most successful motion picture franchise of all-time proves himself as adept at escapist fare as at more ""serious"" material. (Although one could argue those credentials were previously established with Road to Perdition in which he also worked with Craig.) His staging of Skyfalls action sequences are expertly done with an occasional hint of artistry (such as the scintillating confrontation between Bond and bad guy Patrice with the electrified backdrop of Shanghais skyline in the background). He also causes elements of drama and pathos to percolate through the suspense and pyrotechnics. Skyfall is the complete package at least to the extent that any Bond adventure could make such a claim. It challenges perceptions without breaking the formula. It has often been mentioned that Craigs first two outings showed Bourne influences. With that in mind Mendes opens Skyfall with Bond still in Quantum of Solace mode then gradually transitions him back in time bypassing Brosnan Dalton and Moore - all the way back to the Golden Age of Connery. By its end Skyfall has brought us full circle and long-time fans will feel as if theyve come home. The closing scene is just about perfect and if the world ended tomorrow and there was never another Bond outing a better conclusion to the franchise would be hard to imagine. Skyfall begins with a rousing pre-credits sequence set in Istanbul that climaxes with a fight on top of a moving train. Bond is left for dead by MI6 but when he resurfaces its to a nonchalant ""Where the hell have you been?"" from M (Judi Dench) who returns him to active duty before hes ready and sends him on a global trek to locate a hard drive containing the names of all embedded field agents before it can be decrypted. The bad guy Silva (Javier Bardem) isnt your usual 007 megalomaniac however. Hes not interested in world domination - conquering a small island is enough for him. His goal is more personal and his backstory recalls that of Sean Beans 006 in Goldeneye. Along the way Bond tussles with a younger (but no less cranky) Q (Ben Whishaw) and beds two Bond girls - fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and exotic sophisticated sex slave Severine (Berenice Marlohe). He also meets Ms boss Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) whom he dismisses as a ""bureaucrat."" The films structure is odd with no big overproduced climax and a narrative that has more in common with the 60s films than with anything post-Connery. Skyfall raises the emotional stakes to a level not seen since On Her Majestys Secret Service; even Casino Royale didnt push this many buttons. We learn tantalizing bits about Bonds past - not enough to destroy the characters essential ""in the moment"" mystery but enough to dispel the theory that ""James Bond"" is just a code name. The character played by Albert Finney is intriguing and its not hard to surmise this role was written with Sean Connery in mind. (Connery if ever offered the part stuck to his ""never again"" guns and elected to stay retired but it takes little imagination to envision him saying the lines.) Mendes brings with him frequent collaborators Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman. Deakins cinematography may be the best ever in a Bond movie and certainly the best in recent years. This is old-school camerawork in that the picture is stable and the fight scenes are easy to follow. Newmans score makes ample use of the Monty Norman/John Barry ""James Bond Theme"" - the first time it has been part of an incidental score since Craig took over. Adeles opening number ""Skyfall"" hearkens back to the John Barry/Shirley Bassey collaborations. Recent Bond movie openings have not been events. This is an exception. It doesnt feel like a retread. The emphasis on the M/007 relationship introduces a new previously unexplored dynamic between the agent and his boss. Compare how the two mesh in Skyfall with their stately formal interaction in Dr. No. Over the course of her previous six outings Dench has been inching her authoritarian personality closer to the point where she could be considered a full-fledged character. Under Mendes she achieves the goal. And the strength of her performance is matched by that of Javier Bardem who comes across not as a sadistic lunatic but someone deeply wronged and tragically damaged. Sure theres a cartoon element to Silva - its not possible to be a Bond villain without going a little over-the-top - but hes not interchangeable with the many less intriguing antagonists to face off against 007 in the past. Because of MGMs bankruptcy issues we have waited four long years to get Skyfall. Convinced there was a story worth telling Mendes stuck with the production and the result justifies the wait. Id rather get a new Bond of this quality every four years than something along the lines of Quantum of Solace with half the time in between. Skyfall is everything Bond should be encapsulating the best of all the eras - even the brief tenures of Dalton and Lazenby - into a package that celebrates Bond 50 by reassuring us that Bond is back.

Photo (c)Columbia Pictures Like the Rolling Stones James Bond movies turn 50 this year and you cant blame either for playing their hits. What more do you want from ""Start Me Up""? Violins? A hip-hop beat? But like the Stones 007 is showing his wrinkles and in the utterly routine effort ""Skyfall"" were actually expected to cheer each chord weve heard so many times (heres a martini shaker Look its a Walther PPK And theres an Aston Martin) Weve been turned into wretched Pavlovian dogs salivating at the bell instead of the snack. The highlight by far is a classic animated credit sequence Adele you are the new Shirley Bassey. Bond (Daniel Craig) is nearly killed in the opening scene yet another Third World chase (again with the motorcycles and the bazaar? Really?) in which 007 inexplicably keeps calling home to the boss M (Judi Dench) for direction. Guys James Bond does not use permission slips. Wheres the moment where he throws away his headset and goes it alone consequences be damned? Worse hes highly dependent on the heroics of a groovy co-secret agent (Naomie Harris) who seems thrown in to make Bond seem less alarmingly white and male. The sparks between them are nonexistent and brace yourself for an amazingly idiotic exchange between them at the end. Worse still Bond survives something that is unsurvivable (hes not Superman) then feeling his life was endangered by M he hides whines sulks stops shaving and (this is truly unforgivable) drinks a Heineken. (To his credit he does cover the label with his hand ashamed at being caught drinking Austin Powers brew). Back at MI6 spy HQ in London theres a bombing and M gets chastised by her political overseer (Ralph Fiennes) yet when told to resign she simply refuses which seems contrary to the British spirit of taking responsibility. A nerdy new Q (the boy-pixie Ben Whishaw) hands Bond his new sidearm . . . in the middle of the National Gallery? These are secret agents? Do they post photos of their kills on Facebook? Soon were off to China and the Pacific in search of a stolen list of the true identities of secret agents (the idea itself is stolen Remember the NOC list from ""Mission Impossible""?) and to meet the gay supervillain behind everything. He is the campy Silva (Javier Bardem in a Princess Di wig) who caresses Bonds thighs and whispers ""Lets see who ends up on top."" Silva it turns out is an ex-colleague of Bonds who was betrayed by M for no reason except being overenthusiastic in his duties. ""American Beauty"" director Sam Mendes now riding a streak of five bad movies borrows heavily from ""The Dark Knight"" giving Bond a Bruce Wayne back story and a big silly shootout at a Wayne Manor-like estate. Silva becomes a Joker-ish master of disguise. But theres no wit or spirit to the action scenes (if youve seen the trailer youve seen all of the good stuff in this movie) and the imagination-free script keeps expressing amazement at these things called ""computers"" that can apparently wreak so much havoc. Bringing on Mendes and ""Shawshank Redemption"" cinematographer Roger Deakins turns out to be a bit like hiring Mark Rothko to paint your house and I dont mean that in a good way. ""Er Mark whats with the splotch of burnt orange here and the splotch of crimson there? I wanted it all the same color. Also that color was blue."" Mendes and Deakins are so busy trying to be visionary that they dont notice that characters are wandering too far from their roots and half the time you cant see whats going on. A sequence in Shanghai in which Bond fights a fellow assassin against a gorgeous giant screen of jellyfish images degenerates into two anonymous backlit shadows. Silva is introduced with a shot thats so ridiculously deep-focus the camera work becomes a distraction. The scenes at the country house (which feature an amusing cameo by Albert Finney trying his best to sound Scottish) are a bedlam of shadow and blasts of mustard-colored light. There is a nice symmetry between underwater scenes at the beginning and the end but just to summarize how perfunctory most of the movie has been Bardem chimes in ""All this running jumping around its exhausting"" Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Broadway takes big hit from Hurricane Sandy Read Next Broadway takes big hit from Hurricane Sandy Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 49014 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22927 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 19368 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

But to hear everybody in ""Skyfall"" debate whether after 23 movies James is now too long in the tooth for glamorous spy craft -- the leaping onto speeding trains the sneaking up behind a sexy lady as she showers -- you would think the star of this movie is Methuselah. ""Skyfall"" refers to Jamess boyhood manor. But really its what Chicken Little calls his action thriller not 007. At almost 21/2 hours the movie plays like a long familiar family conversation Should we put dad in a home or not? This idea of retirement comes up over and over and it does so at the expense of the actual fun of these movies their exaggerated interpretation of international politics -- warlords terrorists greedy pigs insane demands the pathological need of sex to be had. ""Skyfall"" which has a midnight showing tonight at the Jordans Furniture IMAX theaters in Reading and Natick doesnt feature much of any of that. The movie gives us Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) an evil former agent whos still mad about his treatment by MI6 and its ruthless director M (Judi Dench). He wants the British intelligence agency in general and M in particular to suffer so he steals a file with the names of NATO field operatives and begins to blow their cover one mission at a time. He also has a computer virus obliterate the headquarters and flash ominous messages on Ms laptop. Obviously she needs her precious 007 to stop the destruction. But before he can begin Jamess fitness for work is questioned. He was presumed dead after the films opening sequences and returns to London a drunken wreck. The security breach and Jamess resurrection prompt the new intelligence and security chairman Gareth Malloy (Ralph Fiennes) to question whether its time to put both the spy and his boss out to pasture. Its the dignified thing to do Malloy tells M. ""Oh to hell with dignity"" she spits Denchly. These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isnt worried about world safety. Its fretting over whether to start wearing Depends. After more than an hour Silva reveals himself among the vivid brutalist ruins of Japans deserted Hashima Island. The combination of Bardems slabby handsomeness and his newly yellow hair and orange eyebrows achieves unsightly alchemy Hes Frankensteins Ken doll. Silva ties James up to a chair and proceeds to fondle among other parts his Adams apple. Its quite a moment one that both deliberately echoes a grisly torture sequence in ""Casino Royale"" (a much livelier evening at the movies with Craigs maiden outing as Bond) and implies the characters bisexuality. Silva is flirting with Bond and sadly ""Skyfall"" is flirting with us. Silva brings bond to Hashima Island not for sex but to lecture him about what dinosaurs they all are -- Bond M the agency the series their technology their jet-set approach to intelligence. The script is credited to John Logan and two regular Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. The films been directed by Sam Mendes an Englishman with a high style that can either mask mediocre material (""American Beauty"") or find unexpected moral art in familiar subject matter (the first Gulf war in ""Jarhead""). I dont know what Mendes believed he could bring to the series that would have freed it from all that its obligated to do. It seems as if Silvas contempt for M -- his vengeance is like that of a spurned child -- and her discovery of an orphaned James might push the film into strange psychological territory that M might be some rethinking of the manipulator Angela Lansbury played in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" that the ""M"" might stand sardonically for ""Mommy."" But the misogyny in this movie doesnt extend that far. Its still mostly women as bait screw-ups and exercise. Watching the purposefulness of this movie the way Mendes argues for conversation and atmosphere over conventional incoherently assembled chases and fights I realized I was frustrated. ""Skyfall"" does every single thing these movies have to do (Bonds last-name/full-name introduction the shaking of the martini the sport cars and sport sex; the stunts deployment of gadgets and camped-up villainy) and theres little Mendes can do to enliven the familiarity. He has a set of instructions and straying too far from them risks rearranging an entire room when your assignment was simply to remove a chair. Once James finds himself behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Silva reveals his detachable jaw and the equipment specialist Q and the executive assistant Moneypenny are reintroduced to the series the movies self-defensiveness has atrophied into the kind of nostalgia that calls into question going on with this enterprise at all. Here we go again. Mendes opens things up. There are three exquisite set pieces one in MI6s vast new underground lair that -- austerity measures be damned -- features a chic interrogation hangar with a holding tank that Bardem fills with the high-minded arrogance of Hannibal Lecter and the musky perversion of his serial killer in ""No Country for Old Men."" Another is that Hashima Island interlude. The last is the films climax which has been orchestrated in and around the grand old Skyfall manse in the Scottish Highlands. Nearly every Bond movie has fabulous exterior sequences. The ones in Skyfall are the first to achieve theatricality. Mostly this is the result of ingenious art direction and production design but its also a result of the manner in which the camera and editing resist carving up all that open space. As much as he can Mendes wants you to appreciate the scale. These are sublime locations particularly the last two. Why waste them in a barrage of technical excess? I would love to see them again. That of course would mean watching this movie a second time and theres not enough here to make that worth doing even on HBO at 2 a.m. Mendes conducts things with such deliberateness and precision that often all you have is clockwork. There might be people excited by trains that pull into the station on time but thats the least a good rail system can provide. Mendes meets expectations and visually exceeds them but I didnt have much fun at ""Skyfall."" A kind of incompetence is the engine that keeps the franchise going. Professionalism should come more from MI6 than the filmmaking per se and all you notice with ""Skyfall"" is the professionalism. This is especially true of Craig who after three movies actually does look ready to retire. He has an actors dramatic heft but with the exception of ""Casino Royale"" these movies have given him very little to act which means you need a star with the kind of shameless unembarrassed charisma that Craig -- unlike Sean Connery Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan -- might be too self-consciously talented to deploy. ""Casino Royale"" gave him a psychology to play. Here hes best as a kind of solemn fashion model leaping from an excavator into the car of a moving train stopping only to adjust the cuff of his shirt. Craig is either playing a man whos psychologically firewalled or hes layered a lot of posing and grave expressions into a sophisticated illusion of instinct -- Richard Burton not drunk enough to let loose. For all of ""Skyfall"" I thought about the most recent ""Mission Impossible"" -- ""Ghost Protocol"" -- a movie that didnt need to exist and was seemingly delighted by its own extravagance. That movie had a star who loves loves loves being himself and a director who prizes coherence and was spared the assorted hassles that come with being responsible for a half-century-old franchise. The ""Mission Impossible"" movies as well as the ""Bourne"" films a generous handful of television series and almost anything starring Jason Statham breathe the cultural oxygen of the Bond franchise without having to contend with or maintain its legacy. What was special about these movies ideas of international politics and sexual indecorousness 40 and 50 years ago feels standard now; some of that specialty like Bonds suaveness (Tom Ford made the excellent menswear) has a dated allure. Weve absorbed these movies so fully that theres almost nothing left for them to say. The marketplace demands that the franchise exist and with that comes a kind of pressure not to trash things too much. This means James Bond could never have been a woman or have sex with a man that he must continue to battle craggy foes that hell be more beholden now to the demands of the ratings board than he was even a decade ago (like many of its predecessors the movie is PG-13 but this time the decorum is depressing) that hell never fully live in the 21st century because this series seems to say theres something undignified about how we live now. But if these movies are ever to matter again their makers have to be willing to say to hell with dignity. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

"Review Skyfall - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Skyfall James Bond still going at 50  1/2Thanks to Mendes Craig and Dench the Bond franchise stays current while still feeling its ageNovember 06 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDaniel Craig plays James Bond in ""Skyfall.""Early on in his stage career director Sam Mendes worked with Dame Judi Dench on a production of ""The Cherry Orchard."" Now they have reteamed for a slightly less Chekhovian project the 23rd official James Bond film (24th if you count the Sean Connery off-brander ""Never Say Never Again""). Its the seventh featuring Dench as M Bonds steely handler and more to the box office point the third featuring Daniel Craig as 007 the licensed and in fact bonded killer.This time our man James is charged with rescuing a rapidly shifting geopolitical world from a computer-savvy adversary who shares one trait at least with the Bond villains of the pre-digital Cold War era an ability to attract and retain a mini-army of machine-gun-toting minions ready to take the fall for their leader.The peculiar thing is ""Skyfall"" -- a terrific entertainment most of the way -- contains an undercurrent of loss and bitter nostalgia that wouldnt be out of place in Chekhov the motorcycle chase across the rooftops of Istanbul notwithstanding. This Bond suffers harsh setbacks physical and psychological and must get his mojo back (just like Austin Powers to name one of many Bond-dependent comic leeches) before his hard-won triumph and assertion through action that therell always be an England and very likely a British secret service to serve and protect.The actions often stunning in ""Skyfall."" This was the worry going in. Did director Mendes best known for ""American Beauty"" and the violent but hermetic ""Road to Perdition"" have any real facility for expansive explosive kinetic movement on screen? The answer was yes. He did. He does.The opening launches a frenetic chase -- Bond is after somebody with a list of agency operatives -- conducted in cars on motorcycles and then aboard a speeding train in and outside Istanbul. Its a gas. Not incidentally the sequence introduces Bonds field ally played with great relish and authority by Naomie Harris and ends with a surprising turnabout setting up ""Skyfall"" as a two-track adventure. One track follows Bond as he rehabilitates himself and pursues the shadowy rogue played by Javier Bardem the most singular Bond baddie in decades. The other track follows the fortunes of M the head of MI6 (Dench better than ever) as she fends off criticisms within her own government about the viability of the agency and of fighting terrorism the old-fashioned way.This is where we are now with this franchise which just turned 50 with a bang (""Skyfall"" has already made 300 million outside America). Bond and M and their ilk must justify their methods their very existence. The movie is serious business. But rest assured ""Skyfall"" doesnt feel like a 10-ton load of morbid self-seriousness the way ""The Dark Knight Rises"" did. Its reasonably grown-up escapism but with the swank and polish and movie smarts to deliver what Bond has always delivered death over and over by various means and in glamorously diverse locales. Early in ""Skyfall"" Craigs Bond undergoes a word-association personality test at headquarters. ""Murder"" says the examiner. ""Employment"" answers Bond through his teeth.The story trots from Turkey to London to Shanghai to Macao to Scotland starting with a conscious throwback (the train sequence) to ""From Russia With Love""-era Bond moving on to grim acts of 21st century-brand urban terrorism (London under attack from Bardems master sniveler) and culminating in a scene taking Bond and M to the wilds of Scotland. At this point ""Skyfall"" becomes a kind of Western albeit a Western with helicopters. This part goes on and while the protracted third act doesnt kill the two-hour 23-minute picture ""Casino Royale"" remains the best of the recent Bonds with ""Skyfall"" just a notch below it.The movie looks gorgeous. Roger Deakins one of the greatest cinematographers alive makes everything glow even in the Scottish mist. There are some swell character re-castings and updatings thanks to Harris (no spoilers here) and to Ben Whishaws officious young Q who issues Bond his rather meager spy equipment with the line ""Were you expecting an exploding pen? We dont really go in for that sort of thing anymore."" The script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade revised by John Logan displays some wit and manages to tell its story straight a nice improvement over the previous and mechanical Bond exercise ""Quantum of Solace."" In a Time Out London interview Craig acknowledged the previous Bond films weaknesses. ""We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers strike and there was nothing we could do"" he said. ""The rules were that you couldnt employ anyone as a writer but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it but only just.""""Skyfall"" is more like it.mjphillipstribune.comSkyfall -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense violent sequences throughout some sexuality language and smoking)Running time 223Opens 1207 a.m. Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesJames Bond soars in early ""Skyfall"" reviewsOctober 12 2012Chiwetel Ejiofor Eyed For James Bond VillainApril 4 2014Boosted by James Bond MGM to announce 650 mln debt dealJanuary 31 2013Days end McClane tale tapped out in final Die Hard...February 13 2013James Bond soars to box office record with ""Skyfall""November 11 2012Find More Stories AboutJames BondSkyfallNaomie HarrisTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1106-skyfall-20121107,0,3843615.column",200,skyfall39,skyfall,chicagotribune

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Bond reluctantly rejoins MI6 when a terrorist begins targeting M. BOTTOM LINE A super-suave but softer Bond with Craig barely wrinkling his gorgeous suits. Bardem as a dandyish villain works up a good greasy sweat. CAST Daniel Craig Javier Bardem Judi Dench LENGTH 225 Meet the new Bond same as the old Bond. ""Skyfall"" marks the 23rd James Bond film and Daniel Craigs third time wearing 007s suit but the big milestone here is the 50th cinematic anniversary of Bond first played by Sean Connery in 1962s ""Dr. No."" That semi-event has been duly celebrated in entertainment magazines and ""Skyfall"" sometimes seems overly concerned with its own publicity campaign. Its cool advertisement | advertise on newsday suave and stylish with Craig cat-walking around in Mod-era suits and Adele doing her best Shirley Bassey on the smoky theme song but ""Skyfall"" is so busy recapturing the past that it has trouble moving forward. The Bond of 2006s ""Casino Royale"" the one with newfound testicular fortitude (remember that torture scene?) is suddenly a Clint Eastwood-style relic barely passing the MI6 physical to re-enlist. The new Q (Ben Whishaw) is a baby-faced techno-fop but grizzled Bond still shaves with a straight razor. (""I like to do some things the old-fashioned way"" he purrs to fellow agent Eve played by Naomie Harris.) Even MI6s dependable leader M played by the ever-regal Judi Dench may be put out to pasture by an ambitious politician Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). If this Bond seems date-stamped 1965 his new nemesis Silva (Javier Bardem) is a vision from the early 70s an earth-tone dandy in checkered vest and cream-colored hair. Hes also a swinger who keeps a pretty sex slave (Berenice Lim Marlohe) but squeezes Bonds thighs hopefully. Playing Silva as a mincing terrorist/drag-queen combo Bardem campily steals the show. 223 VideoSkyfall Thats partly because director Sam Mendes indulges more in mood lighting than in fistfighting. He poses Craig like a Ken doll against various exotic backdrops (Macao Shanghai) but barely wrinkles the suits. The films climax which reinvents more than one origin story (and explains the films title) feels satisfyingly apocalyptic which may be a good sign. Perhaps the next Bond will do more shaking than stirring.

This is something of an existential problem and one that keeps Daniel Craigs third spin as 007 from being anything you need to take too seriously but the film goes down so smoothly this issue isnt worth getting worked up about. The movie starts big stays big looks gorgeous and concludes with an all-inclusive smooch to the audience straight out of the Marvel playbook. Anyone who exits the theater without a smile has true problems. Still those who ascribe it deep meaning may be letting the rallying score and Craigs piercing eyes get to them. We open in Istanbul where a hard drive containing the true identities of all known NATO agents embedded with terrorist organizations has been stolen. My wife diligently regularly shreds all her documents and refrains from using the same password everywhere. She clearly is more security-minded than MI6. Its no worry though because when M (Judi Dench truly terrific this time) has trouble she can always rely on 007. He may disappear to a tropical island to soak his weary soul in rum and cheap sex after he overhears her order to ""just take the bloody shot"" that may kill him collaterally but when domestic terror returns to Ol Blighty so does he. Much of ""Skyfall""s second act is devoted to looming forthcoming changes. M wont be able to shake the political fallout and is forced to make a transitory exit with pencil pushing Ralph Fiennes overseeing the proceedings. Furthermore Bond is aging a bit (oy we should all age like Daniel Craig) and at least by the book he may not be the one best suited to go out and retrieve the missing hard drive. However hes the one with the tagged shrapnel of enriched uranium in his shoulder and also hes James Bond. The hunt has all the glitz and glean we expect from this franchise and from a high tech movie made in 2012. (Indeed if one of the comments made about ""Goldfinger"" is ""so 60s"" and ""Goldeneye"" is ""so 90s"" the look and feel of ""Skyfall"" will one day read ""so 2012"") Theres a fight in a Shanghai skyscraper that is brilliantly rendered as well as an assassination-in-disguise attempt that is like ""Day of the Jackal"" on speed. Alas the escaping baddie has visual cues quite similar to Loki in ""The Avengers"" but Javier Bardem is so deliciously wicked as the rage-fueled vengeance machine that he makes sure all of his scenes pop. In the midst of this very taut and somewhat emotionally troubling terror-prevention thriller there are also... occasional nods to the fifty years of James Bond heritage. As a movie lover (and frankly a normal human being who likes things that are awesome) I enjoyed the light use of horn stingers catch phrases or recognizable cars but the fact remains that ""Skyfall"" doesnt NEED these things and the use of them may be considered by some to be a crutch. Worse than that is shatters the reality that the rest of the movie creates. That may however be a good thing because toward the end despite high excitement and dazzling camera work Q (Ben Wishaw) ostensibly becomes a magician that can interpret blobs on a monitor as ""intricate code"" while Bond and Bardem survive traumas that would kill a normal man ten different ways. The message is clear this is a 007 movie dont think about it so much. Still ""Skyfall"" has a resonance that few if any Bond films have. Much of this due to really milking Judi Dench for all shes worth. This is the first film where M is a rounded character and her political struggle affords her an opportunity to wave the cultural flag of Britain in a way few others could. There is also a decision to give James Bond some heavy psychological backstory. Weve had 22 films do we need to hear about his parents NOW? But before you start tsk-tsking give it some time and see how sharply ""Skyfall"" weaves this questionable element in a way that salutes the rest of the series. ""Skyfall"" concludes with a remarkable bit of fan appreciation business such that it puts all three Craig films in a new ""aha"" light. Far be it from me to spoil it here because Im certain youll go out and see this movie. The sun never sets on its fandom.

Bounding back four years after the sour stasis of Quantum of Solace and 50 years after Mr. Bond ordered his first martini on screen this freshly oxygenated entry -- the third starring the totally captivating cool cucumber Daniel Craig as Agent 007 -- is both an elegy and a mission statement. Its also a great long-lasting jolt of pleasure. ""Were under attack"" barks the iron-spined MI6 chief known as M once again played to silvery perfection by Judi Dench. She communicates that heads-up to 007 who doesnt need to be told twice Following a goggling hell-for-leather opening chase that climaxes in a shoot-out atop trains speeding through the outskirts of Istanbul a mission gone wrong results in the grave compromise of Ms entire British intelligence organization. And all clues lead to the cyberterrorist called Silva pale of hair and eyebrow but rich with delicious psychological mischief supplied by Javier Bardem. (As he proved in No Country for Old Men the Oscar-winning Spaniard loves a character with a mad hairdo.) The chase is on sometimes even in 007s original silver Aston Martin a relic rich with memories for so many who have watched the secret agents exploits over the years. Bond and Silva share a past. Bond and M share a past. At one point Bond digs even into his own childhood which allows for a deepening of dramatic color for Craig who has by now fixed his characters posture as his own. The most elegant feat in Skyfall though may be the way director Sam Mendes and screenwriters Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan bestow goodbyes and hellos setting the franchise up for an interesting future. Ben Whishaw (Cloud Atlas) fits in neatly as a skinny mop-haired bespectacled MI6 cyberwonk whos known as...Q. Ralph Fiennes occupies an important space (Ill say no more) as a government type. Naomie Harris steps up as a fellow agent both beautiful and brainy. Under the production design of Dennis Gassner even London itself displays symbols of past and present especially when MI6 moves into temporary digs as bare-bones as those of a Web start-up company. Skyfall teaches the cold fact that the world is now run by a new generation of wily players who are adept almost by birthright at manifesting both evil and its antidote with the flick of a finger on a computer keyboard. ""This is a young mans game"" says Bond. The future looks scary in an entirely new way. But M also offers her devoted employee even more valuable advice ""Dont cock it up."" Craig Mendes and Logan dont. On the contrary they keep calm. They carry on. And they save the empire. The James Bond empire.

Of course its not just any car its an Aston Martin DB5 the preferred Bondmobile since it made its debut a staggering 48 years ago in the third Bond picture Goldfinger.I wasnt among the applauders at a media preview of the new (and 23rd) Bond Skyfall but I did allow myself a chuckle when the shapely silver behemoth heaved into view because its appearance at a crucial juncture in the film was so smartly played. video Video New at the box office Bond is back In this publicity file photo provided by Sony Pictures Daniel Craig right appears with Eva Green in the 2006 James Bond film ""Casino Royale."" AP Film Licensed to thrill the Bond girls Actor Daniel Craig and actress Berenice Marlohe arrive for the royal world premiere of the new 007 film Skyfall at the Royal Albert Hall in London Oct. 23 2012. REUTERS video Video Royals join Craig at Skyfall premiere There are in fact a lot of smarts in Skyfall most of which Ill refrain from revealing here so as not to spoil the fun or the dropping of jaws or (perhaps) even the shedding of tears. Suffice to say Skyfall is one of the best Bonds in the 50-year history of moviedoms most successful franchise.Ably directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty Road to Perdition) it has all the babes bullets blasts high-energy fisticuffs and exotic locales (Istanbul Macau Shanghai Scotland - Scotland?? Yes Scotland) you expect.But what it really has going for it is the unexpected. A past-haunted story for one that owes a lot to of all things the Harry Potter movies. A genius of a villain for another played by a blond () Javier Bardem with a blend of camp menace and pathos thats equal parts Hannibal Lecter Heath Ledgers Joker and No Country for Old Mens Anton Chigurh.And a final 30 minutes - often the weakest stretch in the Bond narrative arc - so crammed with great twists and turns that they in effect recast the foundation of the franchise and all but guarantee its health for at least another 10 20 hell maybe even another 50 years. Skyfall in fact may be the single most important Bond since the mania began with Dr. No in 1962.Of course Mendes his trio of screenwriters and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson didnt have to do this. Fifty years on people arent going to Bond flicks for the shock of the new; they got that when a cantilevered Ursula Andress rose from the sea in her white bikini and affirmed the heterosexuality of millions of adolescent males the word over. No theyre going for the comfort of familiarity for the tropes and traditions - tweaked from time to time of course but never overturned.Skyfall in short could have satisfied by hewing tightly to formula. What it represents instead is the fulfilment of the wisdom shown six years ago in casting Daniel Craig as the sixth James Bond (or perhaps more accurately as the first anti-Bond Bond in a lineage held for 11 films by Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan). Skyfalls his finest 007 outing.Yes even when hes scarred and bruised he looks ridiculously buff (indeed his pectorals are bared more often here than those of his female co-stars). Yet theres a compelling woundedness and soulfulness to him. In contrast to say Roger Moore he gives the viewer the sense that there is a toll to be paid when you kill 14 or 15 persons per movie - a psychic toll as opposed to what the drycleaner charges you for removing the bloodstains from your tuxedo.

""Skyfall"" begins as all James Bond movies must in the middle of a story less relevant than the action sequence that results from it. The very first shot centers on Daniel Craig in his third 007 outing fitting comfortably into the iconically suave character as if it were a sturdy bodysuit freshly cleansed for another bout in the field.

""Who wants to see that kind of stuff?""  Indeed Two decades ahead of ""Dr. No"" Sturges movie sarcastically predicted a key ingredient of the action genres appeal Sometimes a train fight is just a train fight. With ""Skyfall"" echoing this prognosis the franchise has come full circle. No longer attempting to reconstruct the character as in 2006s ""Casino Royale"" ""Skyfall"" avoids reinvention in favor of surface pleasures at every turn. Making his first foray into the action arena director Sam Mendes has carefully latched onto the familiar formula with a film that competently represents many of the familiar Bond ingredients that have the franchise with such monumental staying power as well as the reasons why even at its best the series remains tethered to familiar ground. Studios craft product to suit the needs of an imaginary audience (in ""Sullivans Travels"" one of the moguls tacks ""with a little sex in it"" onto the end of virtually every pitch) so it comes as no great surprise that ""Skyfall"" mostly plays by the rules. If however you seek a wholly original unexpected dosage of action ingenuity look no further than ""Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning"" available on VOD platforms this week ahead of its November release. The bizarrely inventive fourth entry in an unorthodox franchise with a greater capacity for taking risks ""Day of Reckoning"" explores the action genre with a grab bag of possibilities Writer-director John Hyams litters his second entry in the rejuvenated ""Universal Soldier"" series with daring long takes dizzying speed and unruly tonal shifts all of which inject the excessive violence with an otherworldly Rube Goldberg-like quality that invites comparison to animation. In my estimation a movie weighted with ludicrous twists delivers far more excitement than another by-the-numbers Bond triumph. READ MORE Fast and Furious Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning Is One of the Best Action Movies of the Year Shifting the outlandish sci-fi premise to the perspective of a Unisol (which in this installment refers to a clone developed exclusively for the battlefield) ""Day of Reckoning"" revolves around the experiences of a clone-gone-rogue named John (Scott Adkins) pitted against the advances of two menacing Unisol leaders (Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren). The sole remaining ingredients of the comparatively simple-minded 1992 original Van Damme and Lundgren lurk in the shadows of this entry like menacing phantoms of the brutal masculine archetypes they always represent.The movie sports a peculiar alchemy of influences Film noir body horror and martial arts all come into play. The sole consistent ingredient is an emphasis on the element of surprise which Hyams delivers in the context of a relentless pace always one step ahead of our ability to process it. A high-speed freeway chase quickly segues into a duel between two snarling men wielding baseball bats and concludes with one of them missing half his head. The punchline? A cutaway shot to astonished onlookers implying that even in this made-up universe these events push the boundaries of reality. The fourth wall doesnt just break; it explodes in calculated mayhem. For those more enticed by the prospects of playing it safe you could do a lot worse than ""Skyfall."" Mendes treatment of the material lacks that same ingenuity found in ""Day of Reckoning. However as pricey tentpoles go its still a satisfying cut above for the sheer elegance of its visuals due in large part to cinematographer Roger Deakins. A newcomer to the Bond series Deakins work with the Coen brothers ranks among some of the best American cinematography of all time so if ""Skyfall"" holds any weight during the current awards season it should go straight to him. Possibly the most evocative Bond movie of the 23 that have been made it frames the succession of showdowns in wondrously expressionistic terms. Two scenes of nighttime combat find Bond silhouetted against a ominously dark backdrop first surrounded by the deep blue of a skyscraper and then later dashing through a flame-soaked field caked in yellow. The poetry that Deakins brings to these images transcends the limitations of the material and almost -- not quite but almost -- makes it feel fresh. That ""Skyfall"" looks strikingly beautiful may explain why it has already generated waves of positive buzz. At two hours and 25 minutes the movie runs far too long but has been artfully rendered to obscure its fundamental simplicity. A long string of incidents only watchable enough to keep the pace in flux the premise finds Bond briefly going off the grid much to the chagrin of his maternal supporter M. (Judi Dench weirdly underutilized despite her elevated role in the story). A full hour goes by before the arrival of a defected former agent played by Javier Bardem. With his absurdly out-of-whack blonde do and curiously flamboyant delivery Bardems character is weighted with innuendo. Creepy enough for the standards of the material he faces down Bond on two drawn-out occasions before the explosive (yet oddly anti-climactic) finish. The movie staggers forward with episodic surges that may reflect an evolving commercial pressure to import television sensibilities in the feature-length form. The result is paradoxically enjoyable and tiresome (enjoyably tiresome?) but does the trick for a formula that needs only to stun startle and titillate its audience to gain acceptance. Even so a fatigue hangs over the entire picture. ""Were both played out"" Bond tells M. and you can see why. By the time an end credit acknowledges the anniversary and promises further sequels the very idea of more Bond movies arrives like a predetermined mandate. If were lucky that will yield further opportunities to use the franchise as an excuse to keep heating up the genre with unbridled energy. Lets hope so because it will take more than a martini to shake Bond up. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? ""Skyfall"" opens in the U.K. this week and in North America on November 9 when its likely to perform well at the box office for several weeks due to little large-scale competition Craigs continuing appeal and the ongoing marketability of the Bond franchise.

In our culture of hype the currency of praise has been so devalued that no one credits it even when its deserved. The truth is SKYFALL is impressively an uncompromising thriller. It feels plausibly seated in the real world which is testament to the talent involved. Reply arthur May 12 2016 300 pm eric great piece.

Reply tom May 12 2016 300 pm Good review. Thanks Reply Rohan May 12 2016 300 pm As a reader I believe that I have the right to comment and express my opinion on what I read. IndieWire is one of my favorites websites and I enjoy thoroughly what writers bring to this site. I have lots of respect for Ms. Thompson and to some other blogs as well. But this morning as I sit and commenced reading this piece written by Eric Kohn almost made me puke my guts out over my keyboard. Your review of the film begins with giving away the prologue of the film step by step; while instead of giving away the details you could just say Sam Mendes SKYFALL begins with the traditional Bond intro. We all know how a Bond film begins. And then this review says towards the end of the article that it is far too long. See I bet you Eric if Skyfall would be 2 hours long you would say a bit too short for a Bond film. The weakest part of this review is that you sit there and compare Skyfall to Universal Soldier Days of Reckoning. - I dont know Mr. Kohn. My mind is telling me to type Give me a break - You gave away too much plot in this juvenile review of yours. I am sorry. This is not a review. Should I take this to Sony? I would love to see their reaction. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

(Francois Duhamel) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Monday October 22 2012 1242 PM Title Skyfall Talk about hitting the heights. ""Skyfall"" the 23rd James Bond adventure is a great high-voltage thriller that wears oh-so-lightly the grizzled grandeur 007 has earned. A half-century after the superspys cinematic debut -- and six years since Daniel Craigs bow -- the Bond films are again the movies preeminent macho-pop myth. And ""Skyfall"" -- which makes its world premiere Tuesday in London and opens Nov. 9 in the U.S. -- rewards Bond aficionados and new fans alike filling in the blanks of 2006s ""Casino Royale"" while setting the template seen in 1962s ""Dr. No."" Impossible? No because ""Skyfall"" gets nearly everything right. It opens with the films best pretitle sequence ever. Bond and MI6 operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are hot on the trail of a target in Istanbul. Theyre after a disc that contains the real name of every British Secret Service agent. Leaping from a van Bond chases the guy across rooftops on a motorcycle which leads to a rollicking fight on a train -- until a gunshot knocks 007 into a river. With Bond presumed dead M (Judi Dench) and MI6 suffer deadly attacks. When 007 resurfaces with a chest wound and a shaky trigger finger he finds the agency has gone underground. Enid Alvarez/New York Daily News Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe of the new James Bond movie ""Skyfall."" Bond -- still rough around the edges from his wounds -- is issued a Walther PPK and tracking device by the new twenty-ish Q (Ben Whishaw) and heads to Shanghai. There sexy Severine (Berenice Marlowe) leads 007 to Silva (Javier Bardem) an ex-agent with a grudge and hydrogen cyanide scars. As Silva goes after M Bond revs up the Aston Martin DB5 (with the license it had in ""Goldfinger"") and takes his boss ""back to the past"" -- that is to Skyfall the Scottish estate Bond grew up on before he was orphaned. Its here that the fiery finale takes place and the classic Bond world is born. (Ralph Fiennes ministry official? More than just a crank.) While the callbacks are a treat you neednt know every 007 detail to see ""Skyfalls"" smart moves. Yet ironically the problems here are also rooted in the past. The first is the noticeable lack of a mid-film set piece. A fight in a shadowy office looks terrific (the sterling cinematography is by Roger Deakins) but the often chunky midsection needs more. More critical is Bardems choice to make Silva fey and lisping. In an already buzzed-about scene Silva not very subtly comes on to a captive Bond. Craig -- the best actor the 007 series has ever had -- provides a teasing counter-taunt but Bardem gets campier recalling Louis Jourdans prissy baddie in ""Octopussy"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"" henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Maybe the Oscar-winning Bardem feared echoes of his killer from ""No Country for Old Men"" yet Silva is a bizarre throwback. Still itd take more than that to kill ""Skyfall."" Sam Mendes the first Oscar winner (""American Beauty"") to helm a 007 flick adds elegance and intelligence. Slugfests are staged like dramas and personal confrontations crackle. Even Adeles soaring theme ranks with the Bond films finest. Though a notch below ""Royale"" ""Skyfall"" follows that reboots lead making a now 50-year-old icon as cool as when he began. jneumaiernydailynews.com Watch the ""Skyfall"" trailer here Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

We dont really go in for that anymore. Thats Ben Whishaws Q to Daniel Craigs James Bond in Skyfall - a Bond movie that boldly struts forward while looking back over its shoulder to the past. Thats what the 007 films are all about - an evolving mix of tradition and progress - and here we have director Sam Mendes (American Beauty Revolutionary Road) bringing to the franchise a stately look sombre mood and ample room to breathe. Saying that the fiftieth anniversary of the 007 movie project demands the odd knowing wink to the likes of the classic Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger and even the crocodiles that Roger Moore hops across in Live and Let Die. The Bond films are savvy magpies smartly pinching the shiniest newest jewels of moviemaking for themselves. 2008s Quantum of Solace came a cropper by putting its hand too obviously in the till of the Bourne films. But Skyfall much more subtly takes its cues not only from the current moodier breed of superhero movies but also from the world around us. There are nods to terrorism data theft hacking and even attention-grabbing government inquiries - but nothing is specific or exact enough to mean anything significant. This is a Bond movie atmosphere is all. The appearance of contemporary relevance is enough. The story sees Bond in an emotional crisis after a failed mission to Istanbul leaves the names of secret agents in the hands of an unknown villain. Trips to Shanghai and Macau follow as 007 pulls himself together and tries to find the culprit for Judi Denchs M and Ralph Fienness Mallory her Whitehall superior. Theres trouble at home too as a bomb explodes in the MI6 building in London and it becomes clear that M is under threat. Meanwhile a delicious foe emerges in Silva (Javier Bardem) a camp creepy and smooth character who dares to challenge Bonds masculinity in an arresting scene in which his hands run up 007s legs. But the films many commercial sponsors can rest easy Craigs harried stern Bond is as inscrutable and wordless as ever. He has plenty of welcome one-liners (Im just changing carriages he quips leaping from the roof of one train car to the next) but delivers them like someone cracking gags at a funeral. Skyfall is a highly distinctive Bond movie. It has some stunning visual touches motorbikes racing along the roof of Istanbuls Grand Bazaar; the neon playing off the precipitous glass of a skyscraper in Shanghai; the Scottish landscapes of its bleak finale. Also it mostly manages to convince us that theres something at stake by giving a hint of Bonds emotional life beyond this story rooting his crisis in his relationship (or lack of) with his parents without coming on too heavy-handed or pleading with the psychology. Mendes knows theres a risk of coming over po-faced by omitting the traditional pleasures of a Bond movie and his approach seems calculated to stick to the formula while moving things forward. Still the role of the Bond girls played by Naomie Harris as a MI6 colleague and Berenice Marlohe as a femme fatale feel token and underwhelming. The tourism element of Skyfall - especially the Macau section - is awkward too. Its only in the second half of the film which takes place entirely in the UK that you get the feeling that Mendes has played the compulsory 007 cards that any Bond director has to. Now hes properly able to get stuck into a more punchy more unified mix of action emotion and story that climaxes in a fittingly isolated and lonely final showdown between Bond and his latest nemesis.

Brilliant acting strong directing interesting locations and a good script has resulted in the best Bond film ever for me personally.

Just a load of nonsense silly plot poor acting. Do we really want to go out and leave our TVs showing stuff like Homeland Kiling I The Bridge to watch car chases and men in rooms with automatic weapons shooting at each other for several minutes and always missing.

Even the one-liners arent what they were. Notwithstanding some heroic work by the stunt team most notably in the opening sequence it was pretty uninvlving and much too long.. Its an interesting comparison that its running time is about the same as the first half of Lawrence of Arabia yet that film positively speeds by.

Ok there were one or two good action scenes but we have seen them before and the script was poor and thin. What let it down most of all was the lack of plot. Daniel Craig was also not up to scratch - the only really telling part of the film was when he was declared to be past his sell by date. Hopefully that will be dealt with in the next Bond film. Skyfall was reasonably enjoyable without being rivetting - but unfortunately you dont have to think hard to think of something better to do with your time.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 21 2012LefterisFeaturedAs an old fan of Bond films i found this film very disappointing. As other reviewers pointed out already the cars the girls the exotic locations the gadgets are all missing. But whats missing the most is Bond and a plot. Craigs Bond lacks charisma and charm self-sarcasm and cosmopolitan feeling whilst his physique  is more appropriate for an aging night club bouncer than a suit from Savile Row. He struggles to deliver his one -liners and convince. And what can i say about the script it is just plain stupid. Bond is given a radio transmitter so that his position can be located as if the signal from his mobile phone is not good enough; Bond choses to take M to some deserted castle in Scotland cause hey there is no better place to protect her than in the middle of nowhere with shotguns for shooting pheasants; M the head of M16 is trying to hide in the night with a torch in her hand...and the list is endless. Oh did i mention that Bond  for the first time in all films fails his mission in the end? Or that he previously admits a homosexual experience? I bet thats Craig own contribution to the script. I have seen some bad films in my life that were somehow entertaining to watch. This was just painful and boring.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 20 2012NILES CRANEFeaturedOh and for the record 3....(and forgive the typing errors...)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 20 2012derekFeaturedAbsolutley BONDHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 20 2012derekFeaturedAbsolutley BONDHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 18 2012umit yaylaFeaturedIf you are below 11 and your dad is the strongest man in the world then dont miss it boy for the remaining rest just a waste of time.

I must be wrong because Albert Finney playing an old retainer clearly calls Daniel Craig ""James Bond"" when he has no idea that he is a British agent and is clearly using it as his real name. Does this mean that every Bond from Connery onwards is actually the same Bond? And I always thought that ""00s"" had a short lifeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 16 2012critiqueFeaturedEmmmmm hits the nail right on the head in describing this as a ""comic book"" movie. It is competently styled popcorn nonsense nothing more. Charmless unengaging and for my eyss downright tedious.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 15 2012GortFeaturedThe movie is utter garbage. Villain is obviously based on Julian Assange so the whole movie is a propaganda against him. Its sad to see a man who outed video (among other stuff) US soldiers killing innocent children and civilians as this perverse monster while real perpetrators are still not just being unprosecuted but also paying for this movie. The other thing is the total superficial thing going about this movie about rich and muscly guy seducing women from the covers of the magazines. Bah I felt like someone took a dump on my brain after watching this awful movie.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 14 2012NumptyFeaturedA Derivative reboot of the franchise that borrows huge chunks from the likes of Bourne Dark Knight Rises Silence of Lambs etc. etc. etc. The formula is implemented well enough but for all the run-arround theres not a spark of whit intelligence sexual chemistry or intrigue. After half an hour I was just plain bored . Javier Bardem makes a decent baddie who tastefully blows up MI6s arrogant Thameside headquarters (hurrah) . There are a couple of decent stunts in the best tradition. . The new M and Q are unmemorable and characterless. . Whilst still impeccably suited Craigs rugby player build is too chunky for Bond.. and the addition of his new buzz cut hair-doo and ear-coms.device makes him look more like a night club doorman. . The Scotish manor house at the end is an emotiveless CGI effort (Ala Woman in Black). So no suspension of disbelief . Did I mention I was bored..?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 14 2012EmmmmmFeaturedIf you like spys and spying Homeland has more relevance and excellent acting and a pretty good relevant script than this in its little finger. God knows what happened to Bond on this movie. They wee actually getting back on track with contemporary issues and spying in the last two films and then suddenly this load of nonsense. I genuinely hate all comic book movies so this was just a horrible mess of a film that has nothing to do with classic British spy movies or fiction. Genuinely horrible movie.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 13 2012JayFeaturedBond is Back I found the direction by Sam Mendes (surprisingly) adroit. After Marc Forsters disatrous attempts at bringing Bond forward this does heal the wound somewhat. Flawed? Of course - but one heck of a good night out at the cinema. Nice to see that Daniel Craig has fully honed in on the character. Just please if you will bring back the gunbarrel It is the franchises iconic trademark - one seems to forget that.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 12 2012Filmy BobFeaturedI went to this film in Reading last night and most of the audience were grumbling on leaving the cinema. I really did think it was a waste of money and not entertaining. I have seen positive reviews and respect those who make the and are genuine customers. But looking at the dissatisfied cinema customers on this site and others who felt that Skyfall was not a very good movie I wonder at either the weighting or the sources of comments which have bumped this film up. The plot if there could be said to be one was flimsy and almost incomprehensible. The Bond themes action women cars were all missing. Even the Bond character was missing. This was a dull dull film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 10 2012SamuelFeaturedSorry folks but found this a cliched badly written mess from the start - no wonder theyaEUR(tm)ve thrown so much money at marketing it.

Putting the ""intelligence"" in MI6 ""Skyfall"" reps a smart savvy and incredibly satisfying addition to the 007 oeuvre one that places Judi Denchs M at the center of the action. Its taken 23 films and 50 years to get Bonds backstory but the wait was worth it. In Sam Mendes hands the franchise comes full circle revealing the three-film Daniel Craig cycle to be both prelude and coda to the entire series via a foxy chess move that puts these pics on par with Christopher Nolans ""Dark Knight"" trilogy as best-case examples of what cinematic brands can achieve -- resulting in a recipe for nothing short of world domination. This time its personal so to speak only the character seeking revenge isnt our secret-agent hero -- though he has good reason shot in the chest and left for dead in the Istanbul-set opening sequence -- but Silva (Javier Bardem) a character from Ms past who resorts to cyberterrorism as a way of reconciling an old score. Refreshingly unlike the first 20 Bond installments and yet completely of a piece with the franchises core values ""Skyfall"" continues the stripped-down approach introduced in ""Casino Royale"" completing Bonds transformation from kiss-kiss-bang-bang action figure to full-fledged character. This Bond bleeds he hurts and he just might suffer from unresolved mommy issues dredged up when he sees M thrust into a position of extreme jeopardy. Far more than her life is at stake however Amid a breakneck chase involving trains motorcycles conspicuously product-placed Range Rovers and at least one upended fruit cart Bond valiantly tries to retrieve a hard drive containing a list of nearly all the NATO agents who have successfully infiltrated global terrorist organizations only to be sniped by a fellow agent (Naomie Harris) at Ms orders. In the impressive yet decidedly unfamiliar opening-credits montage that follows images of tombstones skulls and other deathly totems supplant the usual gyrating next-to-naked girls while Adeles sultry cabaret-style theme song echoes the throaty Shirley Bassey tunes of old. Though M gets right to work writing Bonds obituary the film doesnt allow audiences to believe him dead for long calling him back to London with a televised report of a bomb going off in MI6 HQ. Whatever parallels it shares with the Bourne series or Nolans astonishingly realized Batman saga ""Skyfall"" radically breaks from the Bond formula while still remaining true to its essential beats presenting a rare case in which audiences can no longer anticipate each twist in advance. Without sacrificing action or overall energy Mendes puts the actors at the forefront exploring their marvelously complex emotional states in ways the franchise has never before dared. Back in Britain Bond submits to a battery of tests that reveal him to be mentally and physically unfit for the assignment before him; even his aim is abysmal. All this makes the subsequent mission more gripping than usual as it introduces a high potential for failure into his typically flawless pursuits -- a view more consistent with the novels where Bond regularly endures his share of damage. This weakness also gives Silva a chance to get inside his head (much as Sean Beans double-crossing 006 attempted in ""GoldenEye"") trying to turn Bond against his country. Taking full advantage of Bardems gift for cold-blooded derangement Silva has even greater plans in store for Bond though the particulars are best discovered onscreen. Suffice to say ""Skyfall"" pushes the character into uncharted realms in terms of both psychology and action. Bond behaves as if coded for loyalty while the remarkable script -- the work of Neal Purvis Robert Wade and John Logan -- invites a level of Freudian analysis entirely absent from previous pics especially as it pertains to protecting M who emerges a surrogate mother of sorts. Though Denchs M was kidnapped once before in ""The World Is Not Enough"" this film gives the actress by far the most dramatic opportunity to explore the character. Whereas she famously dubbed Bond ""a sexist misogynist dinosaur a relic of the Cold War"" in Denchs first appearance in the role M now faces the prospect that her own methods may be extinct. Calling the shots from a control room 2000 miles away she not only nearly got Bond killed but allowed for the top-secret list to fall into Silvas hands placing every embedded agent in immediate jeopardy. Enter Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory a rival national-security suit crying for Ms resignation and an intriguing addition to the plots trust-no-one dynamic. Only Q (played a generation younger than Bond rather than the other way around by dapper young Ben Whishaw) appears fully dependable and even then the lads computer-hacking skills backfire spectacularly triggering an intense mid-movie setpiece beneath Londons streets. While M stands before a disciplinary board Bond goes about his usual blend of drinking gambling shooting and seducing -- all of which Mendes editor Stuart Baird and ace d.p. Roger Deakins render so freshly youd think you were seeing it for the first time. As Severine Silvas fear-stricken mistress Berenice Marlohe puts up little resistance to Bonds charms. While Severines fate may be familiar the film casts Silva in such an unforgivingly cruel light the result feels closer to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or equivalently ruthless R-rated thrillers than to the series typical PG-13-rated 007 romp. In perhaps its most welcome deviation from tradition ""Skyfall"" visits the villains lair early leaving the finale to unspool at a surprise location -- one that reveals intriguing new depths of Bonds personal history while also offering a hearty role for Albert Finney that must have been written with Sean Connery in mind. When asked about her evidently outmoded intelligence tactics M argues that her methods work because the worlds enemies have moved into the shadows. The same could be said of the Bond film series since ""Casino Royale"" with its new willingness to explore what lurks in the shadows of Bonds murky past.

TWITTER Daniel Craig returns for his third turn as the British secret agent in a new James Bond story from director Sam Mendes. The movie James Bond is now 50 years old and wearing his years very well in Skyfall. The most significant reset of the 23-film series thats unconnected to a change of the actor playing 007 this long-awaited third outing for Daniel Craig feels more seriously connected to real-world concerns than any previous entry despite the usual outlandish action scenes glittering settings and larger-than-life characters. THR Cover How the Bond Franchise Almost Died Dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor this beautifully made film certainly will be embraced as one of the best Bonds by loyal fans worldwide and leaves you wanting the next one to turn up sooner than four years from now. Bond watchers have been especially eager for Skyfall to arrive for several reasons particularly to see if the Craig sequence of films can bounce back from the crushing low of Quantum of Solace after starting so high with Casino Royale and to evaluate what fresh perspective might be delivered by such big and unexpected talents as director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The answers are ""yes"" to the first proposition and ""quite a bit"" to the second. Whereas Casino Royale tasted like a fine old vintage served in a snappy new bottle Skyfall seems like a fresh blend altogether one with some weight and complexity to it. Much of this to be sure stems from Mendes who with series veteran writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade along with John Logan yanks Bond M and MI6 out of the world of colorful megalomaniacal villains and into the vexing world of shadowy terrorists and cyber warfare. In the process they also give Bond not only a few aches and pains but a sense of mortality exemplified by a credits sequence festooned not by silhouetted naked women but by images of the secret agents tombstone and of his being sucked to his doom underwater. Since it happens in the 10-minute action opener its giving nothing away to say that -- after an elaborate and logistically outrageous chase through the streets and bazaars and over the roofs of Istanbul and then on top of a train into the countryside -- M is seen writing her veteran agents obituary. PHOTOS The Making of Skyfall Bond is Back Better Than Ever He has survived of course but his brush with death has been so close that Bond goes Jason Bourne for a while holing up anonymously on a tropical beach with a babe and drinking himself to oblivion. But when the modern new London headquarters building of MI6 explodes in a terrorist attack Bond reports back for duty to a boss who herself is being none too gently being shown the door by intelligence and security committee chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). In fact all British agents embedded within terrorist organizations have been compromised and are beginning to be killed making M look incompetent and Bond seem a bit of a dinosaur whose wits and brawn are no match for high-tech warriors. ""So this is it were both played out"" he says to her -- prematurely as it turns out though Bond still is put through some arduous tests to re-earn his old job back. Bond never has endured so many rude remarks about his physical prowess since Sean Connery made his middle-aged one-shot return to the role in the ill-advised Never Say Never Again. For her part M plays a more central role here than she has before and Judi Dench as usual makes the most of the opportunity investing her authority role with great dignity undercut with a sliver of insecurity. The globetrotting continues to Shanghai where the striking high-rises make a terrific nocturnal backdrop to Bonds stealthy pursuit of the assassin/hard-drive thief he narrowly missed in Istanbul. From there its on to Macau where the old Bond re-emerges in a tuxedo to drink his martini (very smartly shaken not stirred by a deft lady bartender) in a casino where he gets hot and heavy with the striking yet nervously neurotic Severine who is given a distinctive preoccupied edge by Berenice Lim Marlohe. Trailing along behind to keep an eye on things and trade dry banter (and perhaps more than that) is field agent Eve very engagingly played by Naomie Harris. Qamp;A Skyfall Star Daniel Craig Reveals the Downside of Being James Bond It is Severine who can take Bond to the man whos causing all the trouble. In a scene of surpassing beauty and weirdness by yacht the two approach a strange island city from which the entire population has just fled. It has just been taken over by a strange tall man with dyed blond hair insinuating humor and heavily armed henchmen. At the 70-minute mark Javier Bardem makes his fabulously staged entrance as Silva who like many Bond villains of the past is half persuasive and half lunatic has delusions of exceptional grandeur and is partial to explaining many things to his captive before he means to kill him. He also has a theatrically sexual side that brings something new to the gallery of Bond villains. In all events Bardem makes him a riveting and most entertaining figure. Even if Bond is able to turn the tables on Silva and bring him back to London as a prisoner thats far from the end of it as Silva is one resourceful chap whose advanced computer skills test the expertise even of the new Q the MI6 weapons and technology guru now reimagined as a very young man and wonderfully played in full geek drag by Ben Whishaw. The scene in which he and Bond meet for the first time in an art gallery is an instant mini-classic. Ultimately there is a very conscious even articulated effort to balance the old and new the traditional and the modern in Skyfall -- stylistically dramatically and thematically. Longtime series producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli never have gone so far as to hire a full control-demanding auteur to direct one of their films and while Mendes certainly is the most distinguished outside director theyve ever brought aboard hes one as tradition-minded as he is innovative. Many of the dramatic scenes would do justice to a nongenre film and the same can be said of the quality of the acting. The traditional quips surface at times in low-key form; some of them are quite good and theyre never corny. The action much of it presumably staged by veteran second unit director Alexander Witt is consistently strong (even if a motorcycle-and-jeep chase through the jammed streets of Istanbul reminds as did a recent one through Manila in The Bourne Legacy that motorized chases through thick urban crowds are never entirely convincing). VIDEO Inside THRs Skyfall Cover Shoot With Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem Tonally the fundamental seriousness of the film places Skyfall at the other end of the Bond spectrum from the monkeyshines of some of the silliest Roger Moore entries such as Moonraker and A View to A Kill. The long climax set at an isolated old house in Scotland presided over by a thickly bearded Albert Finney plays out partly like a highly elaborated version of Straw Dogs albeit with far heavier artillery. The moving and highly satisfying ending nicely tees up the ball for the next round. Deakins cinematography is dense colorful and impactful noticeably a notch or two above the series norm. Production values are similarly at the high end of things and Thomas Newmans score is far from generic finding many moods while delightfully allowing room for Monty Normans immortal Bond theme when the moment calls for it. And oh yes theres Daniel Craig. He owns Bond now and the role is undoubtedly his for as long as he might want it. Perhaps a tad less buff than in Casino Royale and certainly more beat up he entertains the ladies less here than perhaps any Bond ever has. But two other women his boss and the queen have first call on his favors and he repays them for their confidence many times over -- as he does the audience.
