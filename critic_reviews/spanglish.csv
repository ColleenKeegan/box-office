Brookss ""Spanglish"" has a lot on its mind. This culture-clash comedy is about parenting; Latin and Anglo notions of masculinity femininity and family; the lure and perils of assimilation as well as the dangers of getting a four-star restaurant review in The New York Times. The man who made ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"" can always be counted on to explore crannies of upper-middle-class life that Hollywood usually ignores. ""Spanglish"" isnt Brookss best (a tall order) but it feels like one of his most personal.Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni are the Claskys whose shaky marriage becomes even more unhinged when Flor (Paz Vega) and her smart 12-year-old daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) enter their lives. Deb (the spectacular Leoni) is a self-loathing self-absorbed neurotic. Shes the sort of clueless mom who thinks shes being helpful buying clothes for her heavyset daughter (the terrific Sarah Steele) a size too small. John (Sandler) on the other hand is a soulful self-abnegating master chef who expresses himself forthrightly only in the kitchen. Hes drawn to the vibrant Flor and she to him but they spend most of the time sublimating their feelings which creates a sweet unexpectedly sexy chemistry between Vega and Sandler.Brooks creates rich quirky roles--Cloris Leachman is a hoot as Leonis alcoholic live-in mom--but the discrepancy between the sizzle of his writing and the flatness of his camera work has never been so noticeable. ""Spanglish"" feels hemmed in visually monotonous. There are signs that a lot has been cut and in trimming his film Brooks may have squeezed too tight his movie needs breathing space. The recipe is gourmet but this cake never fully rises.

This changes slightly when a pal recommends her for a job cleaning the house of neurotic designer Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni) and her successful chef husband John (Adam Sandler). The wealthy welcoming couple are its soon clear having problems of their own - which apart from the pleasures and pitfalls of parenthood is about all they have in common with their pretty proud and fiercely private employee... A smile a tear a smile... Ever since Terms of Endearment and Taxi James L Brooks has specialised in quality comedy-drama - smartly written superior sitcom stuff that aims to treat in an adult intelligent sensitive way serious issues. Here he touches on economic disparity class divisions social integration parenting marital conflict communication skills culinary fame and so forth all in a characteristically well-meaning but inadequate way. My colleague Jessica Winter has rightly written elsewhere of Brooks regrettable tendency to portray his women as problematically volatile - Deborah especially is quite monstrous - but actually Sandlers all-round nice guy is equally implausible in many respects. Its less a matter of poor casting than of performers made to act up between the admittedly nifty one-liners; this is Hollywood liberal humanism as muted join-the-dots melodrama all carefully calculated colouring broad outlines and no room for fruitful digression. Other examples of Brooks TV mindset drab direction gently probing but painless ethical inquiry and a reassuring insistence that life and people (viewers included naturally) are good.

Hes never on screen. But you can feel the writer-directors touch behind every note. Thats the assured vibe of ""Spanglish"" his latest work about the burst of fresh air a Mexican housekeeper brings to an affluent Los Angeles home. Above all the movies funny and wicked fun. Flor (Paz Vega) a smoldering beauty from Mexico enters the pool area of the wealthy Clasky family. She has come to be interviewed for the job of housekeeper. Tea Leoni and Adam Sandler in""Spanglish"" another bright feather in the cap for that maestro of comedy-drama James L. Brooks.

""She didnt mean it as a compliment"" says Deborahs mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) leaning forward to Flor. ""Its more of an accusation."" An illegal immigrant with a bright teenage daughter Cristina (who narrates the movie) Flor gets the job and more entree to a gilded Los Angeles home where the gate has a punch code the two children go to private school and no one speaks Spanish. Flor speaks no English which means the Claskys -- including Deborahs husband John (Adam Sandler) -- are reduced to sign language and clumsy gestures. Fasten your seat belts gringos its going to be a bumpy cultural ride. Flor soon gets the lay of the land. Deborah who makes no attempt to roll the final ""r"" of Flors name is archly self-absorbed. But she thinks shes the best-intentioned person in the house. Deborahs teenage daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) has a weight problem but is a sweet soul. Theres a younger son Georgie (Ian Hyland) but well hardly hear from him for most of the movie. Flors appalled at Deborah whose idea of encouraging Bernice to lose weight is to buy her daughter a bag of clothes that are about one size too small. But shes gradually drawn to John a milquetoast angel who is the childrens real emotional guardian. Hes an inspired chef by day a doting father by night. Although Johns bumbling stammering utterances are hard enough to understand for English speakers (this is Adam Sandler remember) Flor appreciates his gentleness and sense of empathy. Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) comes fully into the story when the Claskys take a Malibu house for the summer which isnt convenient to Flors bus route. The housekeeper reluctantly agrees to move in with the family along with Cristina. At which point everyone gets to blow their horn bang their drums and make volatile music even soft-spoken John. At one point Flor (using Cristina as a translator) berates John for slipping her daughter 640 for finding him a bag full of sea glass. So John counter-accuses her of crossing the line with his own daughter; she fixed the buttons on Bernices undersized coat so it would ""fit."" When Flor agrees with him John -- married to the imperial Deborah -- is floored. ""Its pretty wild to say something to somebody and have that person concede the point"" he says. Ill let you have the pleasure yourself of hearing the choice lines Evelyn gets to lay on her daughter. It should be said Brooks fixes the fight in Johns favor. Deborah is an all-American harpy a modern obsessive neurotic. Shes fun to hate but you feel as if youre cheating to do so. Perhaps aware of this Brooks and Leoni soften up Deborahs potential caricature as much as possible; she comes through with human warmth in the later stages. But its pretty clear whos wearing the designer black hat. The story isnt Deborahs however. This is about Cristinas perception of her mother and how she came to this house and underwent significant changes. And thats the charm and the sheer blast of it. Beyond all that gorgeousness the Spanish-born Vega is assured and alert a fine comedian. And Sandler proves his touching performance in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was no fluke. And what a joy it is to see Leachman given room to maneuver. As Evelyn shes a pistol carrying that over-filled glass of wine in one hand but never spilling or missing a comic beat. Perhaps ""Spanglish"" doesnt reach the high notes of ""Broadcast News"" which interwove comedy and romance as perfectly as any film since the days of Hepburn and Tracy. But Brookss flair is on full display. The film historian David Thomson once said of Billy Wilder hes ""our last link with the merry wicked talk of the golden age."" Well maybe he wasnt the last.

Its all he can talk about and he leans in close inappropriately intense and hes so convinced hes at last making it all clear for you and youre thinking Get this guy into a nuthouse. Thats the James L. Brooks who wrote and directed the screed called ""Spanglish"" with an unfortunate cast of victims including the luminous Paz Vega the baffled Adam Sandler the wondrous Cloris Leachman and the betrayed Tea Leoni. Adam Sandler and Cloris Leachman are wasted as the wronged husband and his mother-in-law.

Two of them are at least benign if deeply unbelievable Vega a Spanish actress of great beauty and dignity is the Noble Housekeeper Flor Moreno. Noble servants are a Western tradition of course dating back at least as far as ""Gone With the Wind"" in which Butterfly McQueen and Hattie McDaniel patented the role. Whoopi Goldberg further developed it in ""Corrina Corrina"" but at least 75000 actresses have been burdened by its saccharine virtue. Sandler normally a vigorous screen presence no matter the crudeness of the vehicle is the Wronged Husband. He too is noble he too is understanding compassionate a superb father a well-remunerated professional (hes a chef in his own four-star restaurant) a committed caring individual who longs to share his love with his family his community -- and his beautiful housekeeper though of course hes too darn good for anything so base. Both of them however are betrayed by Her. Or should that be after H. Rider Haggard ""She."" She the devil she the monster she the selfish she the vain. Poor Leoni caught hopelessly in Brookss spider web the brunt of his wrath the focus of his hatred the creature from the dark lagoon of his nightmares. This is both an astonishment and a disappointment. Brooks after all invented Mary Richards that icon of American spunk. In movies hes known for his ability rare for a male artist to evoke sympathetic female characters He directed Holly Hunter in ""Broadcast News"" and Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger in ""Terms of Endearment."" But that complexity of character that compassion for flawed humanity completely deserts him here; hes out for blood. Leoni plays Deborah Clasky chef Johns wife and mother of his daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele). Boy does her creator hate her. Whomever shes based upon -- rumor suggests an ex-wife -- I pity. Honey call your lawyer. Are there libel laws in California? The portrait of the marriage is so lopsided it disturbs. Nobodys that bad nobodys that good. Brooks goes after the poor spouse hammer and tongs Shes a terrible mother whos continually mashing the tender ego of her daughter (Bernice is too fat for her taste) shes a bad cook a slovenly housekeeper a deluded narcissist who cares far more about her body -- jogging endless yoga pedicures manicures -- than her family. Shes not supportive when John wins that fourth star. Deborah is also a bad daughter -- shes driven her mother (Leachman) to drink. When Deborah encounters a child she likes better than her own -- that would be Cristina Flors daughter -- she seizes that child essentially attempting to usurp her mother by bribery buying the poor thing new clothes getting her a scholarship at a fancy school. Oh did I mention She cheats on her husband. You know this can be kind of fun. I mean ""Medea"" wouldnt be a laff-riot without a real bad gal in the title role and where would film noir be without its femmes fatales? But the moment where ""Spanglish"" sails into uncharted waters is when Brooks takes us into the bedroom -- dont go there Im thinking please -- and shows us the sensitive male view of bad sex. Again its all her fault. She takes her pleasure from him in a second -- despite his pleading -- then is off at once for a shower and a shopping trip. The movies shame is the performances it squanders. Leachman an old Brooks hand from the ""Mary Tyler Moore"" days plays Deborahs wise if usually drunken mother with a great deal of warmth and wisdom. Shes a great actress and the movie perks up every time shes on-screen. Vega is another great actress and the movie seems set up to explore her character -- its cast in the form of Cristinas memoir as a part of a college entrance essay -- until it loses its way in its fury over Deborah. I kept wondering what she could do in a real role. The kids -- Steele and Shelbie Bruce as Flors daughter -- are superb. But these people seem to be in a different movie from the ugly sitcom adventures of bad Deborah and perfect John. Spanglish (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo and profanity.

Brooks cant guide to a stellar performance. But he or she isnt in this movie. Unspoken attraction Spanglish features stunning performances by Paz Vega as a housekeeper and Adam Sandler as her employer. Columbia Pictures Spanglish is a performers showcase. While the pleasantly sentimental comedy doesnt bowl you over with cinematic technique its likely to make audiences happy. Brooks has directed four previous features and three of them are Terms of Endearment BroadcastNews and As Good as It Gets. Audience-friendliness is something he knows. Of the half-dozen strong performances in Spanglish some are headline stories. Above all this is a Paz Vega movie -- remember that name -- but first you must take the Sandler leap. A lot of people are going to look at the ads and go ""Wait its Adam Sandler."" Yes it is but its in the mold-breaking manner of 2002s Punch-Drunk Love a big-screen beaut that was geared to specialized audiences the way Spanglish is more for the masses. Sandler is the best he has ever been playing the best chef in Los Angeles. About the movie Spanglish    1/2 (out of four) Stars Adam Sandler Tea Leoni Paz Vega Cloris Leachman Shelbie Bruce Sarah Steele Director James L. Brooks Distributor Columbia Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language Opens Friday nationwide Vega is single mom Flor a kind of every mans dream who doesnt know it. Unable to speak English but with a bright daughter Cristina who can (a terrific Shelbie Bruce) shes hired as a domestic by Sandlers palpably neurotic wife (Tea Leoni in a very brave performance). Leoni the best shes been since 1996s Flirting With Disaster cannot ask the time without sounding gauche. She has alienated her adolescent daughter (Sarah Steele) and is probably one of several reasons her mother (Cloris Leachman) is a high-class sot. Reaction to the film may rest on whether you regard Leoni as impossible to be with or a fascinating case study (my own opinion). Otherwise Sandler and Vega are smashing as an obviously attracted couple trying to behave but also just trying to communicate. Theres one superb scene where Cristina has to keep deciding on the fly just how much of a chef-mom altercation to translate when its to her own benefit to be a little selective. Its striking how much emotion that Vega in what looks like a star-making performance is able to convey without benefit of English or subtitles. You watch her in the early going really eager for the language barrier to crumble so you can finally ascertain whats been on her mind. And though Sandlers character blows his stack a few times hes basically a paragon of decency. Interestingly the angry aggression thats always just beneath the surface in his standard comedies is transferred here to Leoni. As for temptation Vega is a babe in any language but she and Sandler struggle to keep it clean. In a memorable bit shes standing in a blouse and skirt on the beach at night as the wind is blowing both it and her hair in profile and he has to ask her to just get out of the breeze and please sit down. Spanglish is the one movie families search for every Christmas for an outing the way Somethings Gotta Give was last year and Jerry Maguire was in 1996. This is all well and good for Grandma but it may inspire Dad to make a DVD run for the unrated version of 2001s steamy Sex and Lucia -- where as fortune would have it Vega plays Lucia.

Brooks latest comedy ""Spanglish"" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures) less In this photo provided by Columbia Pictures Adam Sandler and Ta Leoni as John and Deborah Clasky a married couple having difficulty in their relationship in James L. Brooks latest comedy ""Spanglish"" (AP ... more Uneven Spanglish has good moments 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Spanglish Drama-comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Tea Leoni Paz Vega Cloris Leachman. Directed and written by James L. Brooks. PG-13. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) James L. Brooks that deft chronicler of neuroses has lost his way with the fitfully entertaining patently false ""Spanglish."" Brooks once gave his maddening characters a cushion Shirley MacLaine s Aurora in ""Terms of Endearment"" smothered because she loved and Jack Nicholson s obsessive- compulsive in ""As Good as It Gets"" brayed out of fear. Their counterpart in ""Spanglish"" however is thrust upon us without context an insecure self- obsessed woman (Tea Leoni) acting up because she can. Characters dont have to be likable but they ought to be relatable even if youre just relating to a hit mans need to kill somebody to keep his job. But Leonis character the stay-at-home wife of a celebrity chef (Adam Sandler) is a bad spouse a bad mother and a meddler who tries to commandeer the affections of her housekeepers daughter. She wants the kid as a replacement for her own daughter who doesnt meet her fitness standards. Why she requires a housekeeper is less clear since her mother (Cloris Leachman) lives with the family and helps with her two kids. Mrs. Brady of the Brady Bunch had a lot more use for Alice than this woman does for Flor played by Spanish actress Paz Vega. Leoni is a very attractive woman and she should be credited for giving a brave performance but her character starts to produce involuntary shudders when she appears onscreen. It doesnt help that Leoni must share scenes with Vega a luminous Spanish actress made more luminous by her characters perfection. Written with more than a whiff of condescension the Flor character is the stereotypical noble immigrant whose only concern is her daughter. Flor left Mexico for Los Angeles years ago but she hasnt picked up a lick of English. This isnt supposed to matter because she speaks the international language of good parenting with Sandlers character. Hes an unassuming chef worried about the fuss attending his restaurants four-star rating in the New York Times. In other words his character has the same relationship to reality as a gorgeous selfless housekeeper who doesnt speak English but understands everything happening around her. But theres fun to be had if you can accept ""Spanglishs"" dubious relationship to the actual universe. A hurried sex scene between Leoni and Sandler is a riot and Leachman gets some funny lines. But the Leachman-Leoni moments are disjointed as if portions of their subplot were cut from the final product. The grandmother hasnt misbehaved enough to merit telling Flor ""Thanks for putting up with me."" Scenes of her bad behavior might have helped to explain her daughters callousness. Better yet they might have been fun to watch. Sandler radiates decency capitalizing on his boyish quality as a man who has trouble standing up to his wife. The actors voice rises an octave as the chef reacts to news of a particularly heinous act committed by his wife. ""Really?"" he asks imbuing a single word with years of shared history and a deep trust betrayed. Sandler and Vega mesh well with the children playing their offspring. Sandlers moments with the sweet-faced Sarah Steele as a girl hassled by her mom but loved unconditionally by her dad brim with familial warmth. Young Shelbie Bruce shines in a scene in which Flors child interprets for her mother the daughter using all her might to translate the frustration of a woman taken for a sucker -- or worse yet a saint -- because she doesnt speak the language. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

Spanglish Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spanglish-2004,200,spanglish13,spanglish,rogerebert
"Brookss Spanglish tells its story in a language that you can relate to - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Brookss Spanglish tells its story in a language that you can relate to By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 17 2004 Spanglish"" the new James L. Brooks movie is centered on a laid-off Los Angeles wife and mother named Deborah Clasky (Ta Leoni) and Flor (Paz Vega) the Mexican single mom she hires to be her housekeeper. Neither woman is perfect but both strive to be and the movie thrives on the antagonism among the two of them and Deborahs husband John (Adam Sandler). Brooks is a poet a realist and a wizard when it comes to creating characters who could pass for real people. Here he has reconsidered cultural melodramas such as Stella Dallas"" and Imitation of Life"" in an age of Wife Swap."" What hes come up with is one of the most humane works ever made about the lives of working mothers.The movie is also more than that. Brooks wonders how an immigrant and her American daughter can maintain dual identities without the identities dueling. Its about the invisible scars a mom can leave on a vulnerable kid. Its about class race success parenting ambition pride disappointment -- oh I give up This movie is about life. But not with a capital l.""Brooks weaves his concerns and ideas in his characters without their becoming ciphers or symbols and without insisting on kempt narrative conclusions. Characters are however idealizations for him Deborah is the perfect model of a career woman but in Brookss script and in Leonis fearless performance you also see how big complicated and surprising that model can be. Deborah is willfully oblivious insensitive and casually racist in the way that some privileged liberals can be. But shes always risking vulnerability too.From his days as a writer and creator of The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and Rhoda"" Brooks has never been afraid of headstrong high-strung women. The movies hes built around them --Terms of Endearment"" Broadcast News"" As Good as It Gets"" -- chip away the Teflon to reveal the aching people beneath.These are all characters Brooks wrote after the height of the feminist movement but Deborah is the first of his creations to evoke a generation of women who mightve run out of workplace battles and found themselves ruling their homes like dictators the way were led to believe Hillary Clinton or Martha Stewart might. Parity now seems quaint. Deborah instead is a slave to perfection physical domestic sexual. Passive-aggressively she pushes her chubby young daughter Bernie (Sarah Steele) to lose weight by buying her new clothes that are too small. Deborah actually prefers Flors skinnier prettier 12-year-old daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce).Temporarily jobless Deborah is without an identity. She runs her home like a small business bulldozing John (Adam Sandler) her sensitive chef husband her two kids and her chronically drunk mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) into seeing the world her way. When John finds himself drawn to Flor its only partially because shes beautiful; he also doesnt hear his wifes barking. But Brooks is shrewd in how he allows us to glean how alike the two women are. Flor for one thing is just as turned off by Johns emoting. She thinks hes more like a Mexican woman.""Sandler is at his best when hes matched with a woman who challenges him into submission which Leoni more than does. We see him do something we normally dont listen -- and hes very good at it.Brooks tells Spanglish"" from Cristinas point of view -- or rather he tells it from the point-of-view of the essay shes included in her application to Princeton which is all about her mother. This is a bold move for Brooks whos a 60-something Jew to open his movie in the voice of a 17-year-old Chicana and Im not sure it always works It might be too much like something the essayist Richard Rodriguez would try. But Brookss commitment to identity politics never feels political and its a sign of his confidence that you find yourself lost in the characters hes building.The essay (read by Aimee Garcia) explains that Flor and Cristina left Mexico for the barrios of Southern California where for years Flor works odd jobs never leaves her neighborhood and refuses to learn English. The sight of a boys hands on her daughters derriere makes Flor realize she needs to be home at night and lands her at the Claskys where Flor brings her cousin to translate and Evelyn and Bernie interpret Deborah for Flor. Once Deborah conscripts Flor and Cristina into moving to the Claskys summerhouse the movie flexes its melodramatic muscles without turning to sap.Deborah absconds with Cristina for a day of fun leaving her own daughter at home and striking panic then outrage in Flor. And you get the sense from Vegas patient reactive performance that Deborahs lack of consideration leaves a bruise on this woman. Once Cristina shows up its evident that fragile but loving Bernie will get even shorter shrift from Deborah. (Steele is emotionally boundless without being as showy as Bruce and shes sweet and heartbreaking.)Part of the movies brilliance is the way it shows how Deborahs questionable mothering drives Flor crazy with determination not to lose her daughter. But the frippery of the Claskys bourgeois life is too strong for Cristina to resist. On the car ride home from their afternoon of girl power Cristina tells Deborah Youre the nicest white woman Ive ever met"" turning a century of Hollywood racial condescension sideways. The girls not passing for white shes passing for well off which I guess you could equate with a sort of cultural whiteness.Occasionally mostly in the early going Spanglish"" feels like it might be a tonal disaster. Theres too much fidgeting gawking and stuttering. From a directing standpoint it lacks the crisp social and occupational rhythms of Broadcast News"" the finest comedy ever about work as a window into peoples souls. Spanglish"" is always percolating but its timing is sometimes off.I felt the same way about As Good as It Gets"" but a lot more so. Shtick had replaced the subtlety in Brookss filmmaking and the conversations sounded speechy sometimes preachy. But unlike most American directors Brooks really rewards an audiences perception. And in Spanglish"" the characters are always in dialogue with each other and with the larger evolving world we live in transcending easy demographics. Im not an uptight white woman or a struggling Mexican single mom. Im neither 12 nor as venerable as the fearsome Leachman. But I am human and with Brooks thats really all anyone needs to be.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Brooks enlisted famed French Laundry chef Thomas Keller as the ""culinary consultant"" on his latest movie and even based one of its sets on the design of Kellers restaurant. Maybe Keller should have directed the movie while he was at it. Stuffed with random ingredients spewing random bits of character and story across the screen for more than two hours Spanglish is Brooks unqualified kitchen disaster -- a desperate shapeless overreaching big-screen sitcom of a movie that just wants to be loved. Is that so wrong?In a word yes. Loosely structured as a study of how people do (or dont) cope with success (or lack thereof) Spanglish focuses on the lives of the Clasky family star chef John (Adam Sandler) paralyzed by the fear that a four-star review will transform his cozy bistro into an SRO nightmare; his shrewish wife Deborah (Tea Leoni) recently downsized from her job as a commercial designer; their two young children; and Deborahs liquored-up mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) who pines for her former glory days as a jazz vocalist. Not content with these Brooks keeps piling on the ingredients Flor (The Other Side of the Beds Paz Vega) a Mexican woman who emigrates to Los Angeles along with her bright teenage daughter (Shelbie Bruce) and eventually comes to work as the Claskys live-in maid. Those might have been the makings of exactly the kind of sprawling ensemble comedy-drama Brooks orchestrated deftly in his earlier Terms of Endearment Ill Do Anything and Broadcast News. Here every hesitation that caused the Spanglish shoot to drag on for a Kubrickian six months (with an equally protracted postproduction period) is evident onscreen. The movie never gels it has no focus and whatever Brooks thought he was saying about success or about class differences in America gets lost in translation. The actors fare little better -- particularly Leoni apparently playing Brooks idea of a Bel-Air housewife with too much time on her hands but coming across more like someone with a severe undiagnosed case of manic depression. Only the ebullient Vega (making her English-language debut) carves out something close to a believable full-bodied character. And Sandler has one terrific confrontation with Leoni in which its possible to see what a fine force of reason and calm he might make at the center of some tidier movies seriocomic storm.SPANGLISH | Written and directed by JAMES L.

A problematic attempt at contempo social comedy from an insular point of view ""Spanglish"" feels several drafts away from a lucid piece of storytelling. At its core a sympathetic look at a young Mexican mother in Los Angeles desperate not to lose her daughter to the temptations of a rich and flashy culture James L. Brooks first film in seven years is short on real drama and incident and long on tedium thanks to one irredeemably neurotic central character. Its never wise to underestimate the drawing power of Brooks and star Adam Sandler here in his most straightforward screen performance and mainstream auds probably wont mind Brooks bright and bland TV-style direction. But critical and public reactions will be mixed with B.O. likely to be good if not as good as it gets. Its difficult to engage with a picture when a major character is so out of control emotionally as to require immediate institutionalization even if no one in -- or behind -- the film seems to notice. So it is with Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni) a Bel-Air matron whose complete self-absorption has obliterated any personality and interests she once might have had. A clenched fist of knotted nerves tightened by constant workouts Deborah cant relate to anyone on a human level only in a manner she imagines is appropriate or prescribed. It is into her lushly appointed but emotionally frayed manse that lovely Flor (Paz Vega) comes to work. Having toiled for a pittance but at the same time having provided a safe and nurturing home for her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce very good) since moving north of the border single mom Flor now intends to earn more -- and hits the jackpot with Deborah who unwittingly agrees to overpay her extravagantly. On the other hand little does Flor know shell earn every penny putting up with Deborah whose every well-meaning gesture and comment comes off as hysterical and ill judged. Tale is related by Cristina in the form of a Princeton college application essay which offers the reassurance that things worked out pretty well for this daughter of an illegal immigrant. With mature observational skills the teen recounts the twists and turns that created potential ruptures between her and her single mom who displays a resilient combo of smarts and intuition. The connection between Flor and Cristina provides ""Spanglish"" with its only tangible emotion and sole recognizable theme as everything surrounding it is ill conceived and sketchily worked out. Overreacting just a tad to being newly jobless Deborah flails and flops like a wild garden hose. She deliberately buys too-small clothes for her chubby daughter Bernice (an audience-friendly Sarah Steele) to get her to lose weight and in a very bizarre impromptu sex scene satisfies herself quickly with no regard to her husband John (Sandler) when she was supposed to be congratulating him for being anointed best chef in America. Indeed nothing about the Claskys marriage makes sense. While Deborah is impossibly needy and demanding John is a laid-back guy who likes to hang out with the kids (theres also a young son whos rarely seen) and seems undermotivated to pass as a high-powered star chef of a hot new upscale restaurant (his ambivalence in the face of a four-star review is genuinely amusing). Brooks would have done well to provide a smidgen of backstory about the connection between husband and wife since at this point none exists. Far too obvious motivation for Deborahs craziness is provided by the live-in presence of her mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman in enjoyably grande damish Elaine Stritch mode) an alcoholic former jazz singer whose own promiscuity and irresponsibility has in a schematic formulation caused her daughter to go into maternal overdrive. Having staunchly resisted assimilation for several years by living among other Mexicans and refusing to learn a word of English Flor maintains her distance from the Anglos shenanigans until she and the now-12-year-old Cristina are obliged to move in with them for the summer in Malibu. Cristina who speaks perfect English takes like a duck to the watery luxury and becomes tight with Bernice. Assuming for the umpteenth time that she knows better than Flor what Flor wants Deborah gets Cristina a scholarship at a 20000-a-year private girls school which throws Flor into a crisis of indecision about her daughters destiny; pics central thesis spins on the notion that if Flor allows Cristina to enter the world of Anglo privilege her daughter will become estranged. As this predicament plays itself out a bond begins to grow between the ignored John and Flor made possible by Flors decision to take a crash course in English. Sandler who hasnt had all that much to do up to this point is saddled with some curious dialogue in moments of encroaching intimacy but handles his assignment affably enough while Vega (""Sex and Lucia"") negotiates the hurdles of English with more charm and naturalness than has her glamorous Spanish predecessor in Hollywood Penelope Cruz. Nevertheless their scenes as written and staged lack any tension or audience desire however ambivalent for them to get together despite a convenient moral opening; as viewers will agree with the filmmakers that any physical relationship between husband and housekeeper would be wrong there is hardly any energy or rooting interest charging these key scenes of their developing rapport. Ending does have a nicely rounded feel that will send audiences out in a good mood. Although it attempts to adopt the perspective of outsiders to American society ""Spanglish"" actually feels like the work of someone trying to escape the Bel-Air bubble in an academic way but remaining trapped within it all the same; except for brief moments early on devoted to Flor and Cristinas arrival the action never leaves the Brentwood/Bel-Air/Malibu axis of exclusivity and neither does the mindset. Stylistically pic is devoid of interest as its almost random selection of unimaginatively composed and generally lit shots startlingly resembles the results of multiple-camera television. In stark contrast to Sandlers unassuming ease Leoni acts up a storm and in the process exacerbates Deborahs irksome abrasiveness. Normally funny and appealing Leoni is willing to be vastly unappealing here both behaviorally and physically but unfortunately for her not in the service of illuminating a character written as worthy of examination. Production values are adequate but unexceptional. For Johns restaurant production designer Ida Random has recreated the look of the French Laundry no doubt in homage to the films culinary consultant Thomas Keller owner of the celebrated Napa foodie magnet. Industry insiders will note the presence of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" creator Phil Rosenthal as Johns second-in-command in the kitchen. Hans Zimmers score trades on Astor Piazzolla-style Latin-flavored charm. SpanglishProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Gracie Films production.
