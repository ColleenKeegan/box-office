"Meet Dave | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; meet-dave ) Meet Dave (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Back in the 1980s it wasnt uncommon to hear Eddie Murphy referred to as a ""comic genius."" 20 years later the man who once made a concert film called Raw has become a purveyor of PG-rated pabulum. At one point Murphy could deliver while collecting a big paycheck. These days he seems to have given up on the former in the service of the latter. Meet Dave Murphys latest lackluster ""family comedy"" is a step up from Norbit but thats damning with faint praise. (Meet Dave is helmed by Norbits director Brian Robbins - not a good sign.) After the early 2007 misfire which some pundits believe cost Murphy an Oscar theres nowhere to go but up. With Meet Dave that trajectory is achieved but it doesnt go far enough to avoid disappointment. Meet Dave is movie-making by the numbers. Murphy mugging for the camera check. Obligatory bathroom joke check. Flaccid romance check. More mugging for the camera with physical comedy thrown in check. Painful melodrama trying to tug at the heartstrings check. Feel-good ending check. This is the kind of movie any half-talented actor could do in his sleep and one gets the feeling that Murphy is counting sheep (either that or the dollars added to his bank account). There arent even the occasional ""clever"" moments that many mediocre comedies like this offer unless you count the various retread Star Trek parodies. (Any sci-fi comedy apparently must take time to lampoon Star Trek even though Trek hasnt been culturally relevant for 15 years.) Once again in what has become a trademark Murphy plays multiple roles. This time however he avoids fat suits and cross-dressing. With Shatneresque mannerisms he plays the Captain of a spaceship he has piloted to Earth on a mission to save his home planet. Unfortunately to do so requires draining the oceans of their water thereby making concerns about Global Warming rather insignificant. Key members of the crew include the warlike and by-the-book Number Two (Ed Helms); the attractive Number Three (Gabrielle Union) who wishes the Captain would notice her; the security officer (Pat Kilbane); and the Engineer without a Scottish accent (Judah Friendlander). All these people are about an inch tall and they inhabit a ship (called ""Dave"") that appears from the outside to be a human-sized replica of their captain. Dave lands in New York City more a fish out of water than Crocodile Dundee and is taken in by a single mother Gina (Elizabeth Banks) and her nerdy son Josh (Austin Lynd Myers). Once the Captain determines that humans arent all bad he must decide if saving his planet is worth destroying another. It would be unfair to lament that there are no funny sequences to be found throughout the whole of Meet Dave. Murphy is a gifted enough performer that even when hes on auto-pilot he can convey the occasional mirthful moment. His co-stars however are marooned. Every half-hearted chuckle comes as a result of one or another of Murphys antics. No one else is remotely amusing - not Ed Helms as the second-in-command with a broomstick up his butt not Pat Kilbane as the A Chorus Line-obsessed security officer and not Elizabeth Banks as the woman coping with Daves odd behavior. This is not Murphys first fish-out-of-water comedy but its vastly inferior to his previous such endeavor 1988s Coming to America. Murphys re-visit to the genre two decades later is considerably less fresh and funny although the PG rating may have something to do with that. Coming to America was unapologetically raunchy; Meet Dave is neutered. Sex jokes have been replaced by quips about Google Yahoo and Old Navy. Rather than making Meet Dave seem new and relevant they merely highlight how tired this entire production is. This is made-for-TV material dressed up by Eddie Murphys participation into a theatrical release.

Whats the logic of that design? The logic is that the whole expensive movie was built in the image of Eddie Murphy a still-talented star who still commands kings ransoms to make comedies that still attract gleeful audiences no matter how arbitrary erratic perfunctory illogical ramshackle or grotesque those movies may be. And this new one is only some of the above -- dumbfoundingly erratic for the most part but smart and funny from time to time especially when Mr. Murphy in the pseudo-person of the spaceship tries to imitate earthling behavior. That means learning to walk the walk (though Vincent DOnofrio did a wilder version as a discombobulated alien in ""Men in Black""); talk the talk (calibrating the right pitch is as much of a problem as finding the right words) and eat the eats (meatloaf which the spaceships database confuses with the singer Meat Loaf then hot dogs 85 of which the spaceship consumes while posing as a contestant at a Manhattan street fair). Above all it means that the puppeteer orchestrating these behaviors -- the pompous pedantic captain inside the strutting machine -- must learn to navigate the bafflements of earthling emotions starting and ending with love. See a clip from the film ""Meet Dave."" Video courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox. If some of this sounds familiar its because ""Meet Dave"" is nothing if not derivative. (Brian Robbins directed from a script by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett.) You name it and the filmmakers have borrowed from it not only ""Men In Black"" but ""Mork and Mindy"" ""Fantastic Voyage"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (which Mr. Murphy is remaking) and ""Horton Hears a Who"" among others. (The spaceship wears a white suit because the aliens had intercepted an episode of ""Fantasy Island"" and figured everyone on earth wore white suits.) Elizabeth Banks plays an earthling who becomes the object of the captains love; shes likeable and attractive though awfully earnest. Gabrielle Union as the ships culture officer isnt earnest at all; shes dynamic and increasingly alluring as she like the captain and the rest of the crew takes on the most alien behaviors of the host planet. When certain members of the crew abandon ship for terra firma ""Meet Dave"" changes radically -- neither for the better nor worse since those terms dont really apply -- and the whole dramatic contraption self-destructs well before the end of its 90-minute running time. Yet the spectacle is seldom boring. Mega-budget grotesque is an art form of its own. See a clip from the film ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. Hellboy II The Golden Army If you didnt know that theres a Troll Market underneath the east tower of the Brooklyn Bridge you need to brush up on your monstrosities with the help of Guillermo del Toros hugely inventive -- and smashingly beautiful -- ""Hellboy II The Golden Army."" Like the first Hellboy feature four years ago this film was based on Mike Mignolas Dark Horse comic and stars Ron Perlman as the red-faced cigar-puffing kitten-and-candy-loving working-class do-gooder who was born a demon but wants to fit in as a human. In that previous episode Hellboy battled a mad monk plus hordes of tentacled egg-laying creatures that had infested our society. Now hes our bulwark against an indestructible robot army that waits to be released from the bowels of the earth. While it waits (for quite a long time actually) Mr. del Toro and his lavishly gifted colleagues -- among them the cinematographer Guillermo Navarro the production designer Stephen Scott and the creatures-and-effects specialist Mike Elizalde -- trot out the most spectacular assortment of life forms since ""Star Wars"" opened its cantina. ""Hellboy II"" From Concept to Creation Indeed ""Hellboy II"" is best savored as a bestiary one that includes an eyeless Angel of Death a legless Bethmoora Goblin (whos a long way from Glocca Mora) and some extremely unpleasant Tooth Fairies -- their most prominent feature being their teeth -- who feed diabolically on calcium. The pace isnt always brisk; this film seems more dependent than its predecessor on set pieces. But the pieces are impressive and Hellboy is accompanied once again by Doug Joness aquatic empath Abe and Selma Blairs melancholy pyrokinetic Liz. She keeps trying with mixed results not to set herself on fire. Journey to the Center of the Earth ENLARGE Brendan Fraser Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem in Journey to the Center of the Earth. New Line Cinema Surprising as it may be given an unpromising trailer the 3D update of Jules Vernes ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" turns out to be perfectly charming as well as predictably eye-popping. 3D movies have an ironclad obligation to scare the audience with water squirted from hoses or tossed from buckets and this one observes the convention with a vengeance. (Watch out for spittle spit both by man and beast.) Beyond that though the illusion of depth enhances the imaginative treatment of an extremely simple story -- even simpler than the one in the much beloved 1959 version that starred James Mason and played out by a smaller cast. See a clip from the film ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Video courtesy of New Line Cinema. A cast of three principals to be precise Brendan Fraser as a scientist looking for traces of his vulcanologist brother who may have gone down a volcanic tube (the geological counterpart of Alices rabbit hole); Josh Hutcherson as his young nephew and Anita Briem as their Icelandic mountain guide. Mr. Fraser hits a silly symphony of right notes; hes lightly amused by the preposterous surroundings but never self-amused. And what surroundings they are giant dandelions that scatter their seeds all over the theater giant Venus fly traps magnetic rocks floating in a void mine shafts with roller-coaster tracks a bio-luminous bird that hovered like Tinker Bell over the row in front of mine. The film marks the auspicious directorial debut of a special effects expert named Eric Brevig. My only quarrel with his direction is that he didnt give Anita Briem enough to do. An Icelandic beauty who speaks English with a barely perceptible but enchanting lilt she has a few brisk dialogue scenes near the beginning after which her character is mainly in danger. In those early scenes though Ms. Briem reveals a vivid spirit and a gift for comedy. She needs to be seen much more prominently on the Earths surface. DVD TIP ENLARGE Guillermo del Toro is best known for ""Pans Labyrinth"" the dark and remarkable fantasy set in Spain during the civil war that won three Oscars last year. At least as remarkable and perhaps superior as an allegory of that war is his 2001 horror film ""The Devils Backbone."" The time is the late 1930s and the setting is a Spanish orphanage a place of shelter and learning thats haunted by more than standard spooks. The orphanage and its school are emblematic of civilized Spain menaced from within by fascist violence. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

"Eddie Murphys Meet Dave a pleasing summer flick | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentEddie Murphys Meet Dave a pleasing summer flickIts going to take a lot to get us to forgive them for Norbit  but Eddie Murphy and director Brian Robbins have atoned for some of their cinematic sins with Meet Dave .By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. July 11 2008 Meet Dave (out of 4)Starring Eddie Murphy Elizabeth Banks Gabrielle Union and Ed Helms. Directed by Brian Robbins. 90 minutes. At major theatres. PG Its going to take a lot to get us to forgive them for Norbit but Eddie Murphy and director Brian Robbins have atoned for some of their cinematic sins with Meet Dave.The summer popcorn flick manages to deliver more than the standard sci-fi send-up thanks to a solid supporting cast - most of whom come from TV - that help bolster Murphys average work.(In this Murphy doubleheader he seems content to skim the best of his resume - Axel Foleys laugh from Beverly Hills Cop and Prince Akeems Coming to America accent.)And the script by Rob Greenberg (Frasier) and Mystery Science Theater 3000 alum Bill Corbett manages to get some good yuks in amid the now-standard bathroom jokes.An orb has been sent from the planet Nil to drain Earths oceans to power Nils salt-starved dying world and its teeny-tiny inhabitants follow to try to track it down travelling in a spaceship thats a human-sized replica of their captain (Murphy) dressed in a white suit that looks like it was lifted from John Travoltas closet circa 1977.The ship crash-lands beside the Statue of Liberty actually a spectacular face plant and the invasion is on.The gigantic head is the bridge (feel free to make an ego joke at Murphys expense here) and various bodily functions are controlled by 100 wee crewmembers inside predictably right down to the posterior.Behind the eye-socket windows the captain runs the show giving commands to various body parts with the help of Cultural Officer No. 3 (stunning Gabrielle Union in a sweetly pleasing performance) who advises him on how Earth runs with the aid of ""the planetary database Google.""Making contact with the primitive Earthlings is the only answer to finding the AWOL orb. Widowed mom Gina (Elizabeth Banks) makes the first move by running over the mysterious guy in disco finery.Blend in and mimic No. 3 advises. So the captain ends up with the Earth name Dave Ming-Chang and a devoted new friend in Ginas 10-year-old son Josh (Austin Lynd Myers) who also happens to know where the orb is.Dave does his best to fit in. He goes shopping for more acceptable threads in Old Navy but ends up in a tussle with a turtleneck. And as much as he wants to learn the local lingo he ends his evening with Gina with a stilted ""Time for me to exit into the night."" Is he just an average New York weirdo?Meanwhile a cop who is ready to believe and his doubting-Thomas partner are investigating the mysterious crash site and are on the lookout for the visitor.Dave is suddenly finding Earth to be a lot more hospitable than he first imagined and hes enjoying Ginas world - complete with mojitos and salsa dancing - and Joshs hero worship. Maybe he shouldnt suck up the oceans and destroy the place after all.Back on the good ship Dave the crew are changing as theyre exposed to the pleasures of the blue planet. The monochrome little people of Nil are growing personalities. 30 Rocks Judah Friedlander is especially good as the nerdy science officer who discovers the wonders of online dating. None of this sits well with by-the-book No. 2 (The Offices Ed Helms) who thinks that Dave should be relieved of his command. And No. 3 is starting to wonder if the captain will ever see her as anything more than an interstellar workmate.Meet Dave owes much to Honey I Shrunk the Kids and a passing nod to Men in Black Inner Space and even Fantastic Voyage. And for such a big-budget outing - rumoured to be 100 million - the CGI is wobbly at times.But theres enough to like in this one to make it enjoyable and theres an underlying message about the good side of human nature that is delivered along with the popcorn. Cheaper than extra butter and better for you too.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Eddie Murphy Elizabeth Banks Gabrielle Union and Scott Caan. Directed by Brian Robbins. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Dreamgirls"" came along at a critical juncture in Eddie Murphys career. A series of bad choices in movie roles had led people to forget how supremely talented he is. His new comedy ""Meet Dave"" isnt likely to win Murphy another Oscar nomination. But at least it allows him to do what he does best - loads of physical comedy - and doesnt rely principally on special effects for its humor. The story line is hardly original Dave is a visitor from another planet let loose on Manhattan. But its a perfect setup for Murphy who must show Dave attempting to imitate New Yorkers. His elastic features especially his mouth allow him to contort his expressions. Theres a very funny bit at the beginning of him mimicking a mime. His legs keep shooting out missing the mark on each step. It wouldnt be an Eddie Murphy movie if he didnt get to play a couple of roles. Besides being an alien Murphy also is the captain of an unusual vessel from outer space Dave himself. Within him are dozens of Lilliputians each 2 inches tall scurrying around trying to make sure Dave is shipshape. Unfortunately the ships limited research bank gets him off to a shaky start by dressing him in a white disco suit right out of ""Saturday Night Fever"" - supposedly still the rage among earthlings. When Dave walks out into the street against the light and is hit by a car the spaceship repair shop sets to work straightening out his appendages. All these tiny creatures make a great visual interacting with humans. One of them travels through Manhattan in a shirt pocket. Theyre subject to everything Dave eats and drinks - his first sip of water nearly drowns the lot of them. Murphys ship captain is suavely self-assured and oblivious to rumblings of a mutiny. Hes also unaware that his cultural officer (Gabrielle Union) is attracted to him. Union wins laughs by playing her role completely straight. Screenwriters Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett create an amusing hierarchy in this world within a world. But they seem to have run out of gas when it came to regular-size people. Dave hooks up with Gina (Elizabeth Banks) the single mom who accidentally hit him with her car but their feelings toward one another go unexplored. Banks who radiates warmth is such an inviting screen presence you wish she were given more to do. ""Meet Dave"" would have been a far better movie if Gina and Daves relationship had been fleshed out along the lines of Tom Hanks passion for a mermaid in ""Splash."" Dave might have seemed almost human. Instead director Brian Robbins keeps going for easy laughs. When Gina asks him to make the eggs for breakfast he mixes the shells in. You cant have a creature from outer space jaunting around town too long without arousing the suspicions of New Yorks finest in this case Officer Dooley (a jittery Scott Caan) who believes in space aliens. When a miniature one jumps from Daves ear into his coffee cup Dooley sees it as vindication. Pay close attention at the beginning for an explanation of why Earth is being visited by this spacecraft. It appears their planet is in desperate need of salt and they have come to steal ours probably causing Earths annihilation in the process. Thats not the real reason though. The spacecraft lands so that Murphy can play a visitor from another planet. -- AdvisorySexually suggestive humor.

The good news is that ""Meet Dave"" isnt a totally mirthless disaster on the order of ""Pluto Nash"" which could have ended the movie career of a less resilient and talented comedian. The bad news is that Murphy has fallen back into the comfortable rut of sloppy family comedies that are low on laughs and high on toilet jokes. ""Meet Dave"" actually has a decent premise - one of Murphys roles is as a man-size starship that crash-lands on Liberty Island. The first 10 minutes as the white-suited starship wanders mutely around Manhattan are among the movies funniest. The laughter ends when Murphy starts talking in the worst British accent since Madonna in his other role the captain of a crew of 2-inch-high extraterrestrials who are operating the spaceship. Things get rapidly dumber from here. The starship which calls itself Dave Ming Cheng starts dating artist Gina (Elizabeth Banks) a single mom with an 11-year-old son named Josh (Austyn Lind Myers). The captain wants to retrieve an orb that Josh found that will enable the crew to suck all the water out of the Earths oceans so they can use the salt to save their own planet Nil. Its your basic fish-out-of-water-trying-to-suck-away-the-water plot with far too many subplots for a 90-minute movie. Besides the least convincing interracial romance since ""Hancock"" theres another romance between the captain and his adoring cultural officer No. 3 (Gabrielle Union a rare Murphy leading lady whom you havent forgotten before the end credits roll). Theres also Dave providing self-esteem coaching to the relentlessly boring Josh whose soldier dad the movie seems to imply was killed in the Iraq war; the crew of Starship Dave going native in the most stereotypical ways imaginable (Kevin Harts No. 17 turns into a screaming queen after a glimpse of ""A Chorus Line""); a couple of bumbling cops (one played by Scott Caan) on Daves trail; and a mutiny led by the anal No. 2 (Ed Helms of ""The Office""). There are some laughs here and there but this is badly edited hack work. Director Brian Robbins (""Norbit"") does an especially poor job of combining Manhattan locations and scenes obviously filmed on studio sound stages (like Daves participation in the Nathans hot dog eating contest). Except for one sequence in which the captain and No. 2 dodge traffic in Times Square the effects are subpar. Like its namesake ""Meet Dave"" is a noisy hollow vehicle that even contains an unwitting apology for itself in a line of dialogue ""Sorry Earth sometimes No. 2 happens"" Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next WITTY MARITAL BLISS Read Next WITTY MARITAL BLISS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 35133 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22493 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19071 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

""Norbit"" and ""The Nutty Professor II The Klumps"" define him now which the edgy comic-turned-family film staple probably prefers over ""Daddy Day Care"" and ""The Haunted Mansion."" Maybe he feels too exposed when its his own face out there.Whatever the reason seeing ""Meet Dave"" and its spotty but distinct pleasures shows what a pity it is to lose Murphy to those makeup-heavy roles. Not that this sci-fi comedy is good; its premise - a spaceship shaped like a human lands on Earth as tiny aliens inside control his actions - seems derived from a segment of Woody Allens 1972 ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)"" in which parts of a guys body are manipulated by small futuristic-looking crewmen. Its a fun but limited idea and this movies attempts to find new angles ultimately land with a thud. But then Murphy makes goofy expressions to New Yorkers on the street or walks robotically through a door or finds a dozen ways to say ""Welcome to Old Navy"" and something clicks He may be sleepwalking through another medium-sized hit but its a lie to say he has lost his mojo entirely. In the movie what the inch-tall ""Nilians"" have lost is an orb that will suck up the Earths water needed to save the planet of Nil so they land an Eddie-looking craft at the Statue of Liberty. On the ships bridge behind the eyes the haughty captain (also Murphy) deals with his power-hungry ""No. 2"" (Ed Helms) and gorgeous ""No. 3"" (Gabrielle Union) who like the whole team becomes more emotional the more time she spends in the Big Apple. Meanwhile the ship happens upon a hippie mom (Elizabeth Banks) and her son and they - of course - learn from the odd man who says hes ""Dave Ming Chang"" and whose feet can unscrew to become tiny space shuttles. Dumb idea? What was the giveaway? The ""Star Trek"" gibes feel especially lazy since the movie ought to be ""Men in Black"" kicky not sketch-comedy dusty. And Murphy should be even more physically unrestrained; one of the best things about his Oscar-nominated turn in ""Dreamgirls"" was how he inhabited his body during the musical numbers. As Dave in his white suit learns to silly-walk like a man it calls to mind Steve Martin wrestling with himself in ""All of Me."" Murphy may want to disappear whenever he can but if he let loose some more he might not need a facade to hide behind ever again.Joe Neumaier Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Peter Rainer July 12 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Eddie Murphy is one of the most alarmingly gifted comic actors America has ever produced but he persists in making comedies that are beneath him. Im thinking most recently of ""Norbit"" but of course the list goes on and on. Hes also alarmingly versatile. Anybody who could play the chubster in ""The Nutty Professor"" and the junkie crooner in ""Dreamgirls"" with equal success can do just about anything.In ""Meet Dave"" Murphy is once again however lucratively marking time. Dave is an alien spaceship shaped as a human entity - it looks like surprise Eddie Murphy - that crash-lands in New York. The ship is piloted by a miniature captain also played by Murphy.The human-sized Dave has numerous comic encounters in New York and some of them such as the scene where he dances salsa or attempts to mimic a couple kissing in Central Park are laugh-out-loud funny. But theres a sappy subplot involving Elizabeth Banks as a single mom that seems designed to inform us that yes spaceships are people too. When will Eddie Murphy think as highly of his talents as we do? Grade C (Rated PG for bawdy and suggestive humor action and some language.)

Comments Meet Dave Eddie Murphy indulges his penchant for dual roles in this sci-fi comedy playing both the captain of a crew of tiny aliens and the humanoid spaceship they pilot to earth. Aimed squarely at the family audience this is squeaky clean--even the toilet humor is sanitized--but so enervated it feels like a bad case of jet lag. The insipid gags fail to exploit Murphys gift for physical humor Elizabeth Banks and Gabrielle Union are merely decorative and Ed Helms (The Office) playing a character called Number 2 looks appropriately constipated. The key image is a close-up of Murphys gleaming choppers but aside from that the movie is toothless. Brian Robbins (The Shaggy Dog Norbit) directed. PG 90 min.

(20th century fox) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / July 11 2008 In ""Meet Dave"" Eddie Murphy doesnt sound like himself. He sounds like Tina Turner accepting all her 1985 Grammys - a post-colonial Caribbean queen. He wears a three-piece suit as white as Ryan Seacrests teeth and the skin on his ageless face is milky but tight like the top layer on a cup of pudding. Hes either required to stand with his eyes abug or make sudden robotically stiff gestures. Murphy is supposed to be playing Dave Ming Chang a spaceship controlled by microscopic humans but he looks like an escapee from Madame Tussauds.An hour in a wax museum would provide a slightly better time than this movie which has Murphy also playing the tiny captain controlling his human-size self from a control deck in the spaceships head. Its mostly harmless. Its also entirely dumb as dumb as anyone could hope a movie that ends with a flying wingtip shoe to be. The plot has the captain and his crew in New York City looking for an orb to save their distant planet. Its ""WALL-E"" for nincompoops and somehow Elizabeth Banks Scott Caan and Caans radioactive-looking tan get mixed up in it.Surrounded by a mixed-nuts crew (Judah Friedlander from ""30 Rock"" Ed Helms from ""The Office"" and Gabrielle Union from ""Tyler Perrys Daddys Little Girls"") Murphy tries to keep the worship-bee comedians from stealing his show. But things on that space bridge seem like ""Star Trek The Public Access Years."" If Helms wants to stuff that under his shirt Murphy should probably let him.But he cant say no to any of the gags in this movie not even the one that requires him - as the well-dressed spaceship - to drink a bottle of ketchup or another in which he backs out of a room like Mork might have done to Mindy. The movie has giant toy sets meant to represent the stations in Daves body. Friedlander for instance handles the buttocks so when money rains from between Daves legs it presumably is he whos released the valve.The director Brian Robbins oversaw Murphys criminal offenses in last years ""Norbit"" and exhibits even less wit here. Hes encouraged the actors manning the mouth regions to slip and slosh around grabbing the big molars like theyre on a Universal Studios ride Honey I Shrunk My Dignity. The movie has the amateurish earnestness of a school play and the sad overnight construction of certain science projects. The special effects here may as well be done by Mattel.Theres a tremendous possibility that Murphy has no friends. What kind of pal would let the star of ""Pluto Nash"" near another science-fiction comedy? Its as if he and Mike Myers are in a race to see whose ingenuity can run more flagrantly aground until the next ""Shrek"" picture comes along. To be fair to Murphy ""Meet Dave"" is no ""Love Guru."" Hes not trying nearly as hard as Myers was so the movie is scarcely as excruciating. On just about every occasion in ""Meet Dave"" Murphy appears to be on the verge of cracking himself up. This is good news. At least someone found him funny. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

Cynics may expect the worst of another Eddie Murphy vehicle involving extraterrestrials -- insert joke about ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" here -- but that only makes ""Meet Dave"" all the more pleasant a surprise. Aimed at the same family audiences that flocked to Murphys ""Doctor Dolittle"" comedies this lightly amusing and sweet Fox release should score midrange summer B.O. numbers despite competition from other kidpics in theatrical circulation and later enjoy a long shelf life as homevid fare. Dave Ming Chang (Murphy) is a man who falls to Earth and winds up wandering the streets of Manhattan. Decked out in a disco-era white suit and proceeding with the stiff sudden movements of a disoriented stork Dave appears to be the epitome of a fish out of water. But thats only because he really isnt a man at all. Rather Dave is a spacecraft meticulously constructed in the image of its tiny Captain (also Murphy) and filled with an entire crew of similarly miniscule space invaders. These strange visitors from the planet Nil arrive with spotty and largely outdated ideas about Earth language and customs. (The white suit? Blame it on the only TV rerun ever to reach Nil.) Theyre confused and intrigued by the oddities they encounter -- why for example do Earthlings amass vast repositories of vital information then give these invaluable resources such silly names as Google and Yahoo? But the Captain and his loyal No. 3 (Gabrielle Union radiant as always) must do a little Googling of their own to complete their mission finding a missing baseball-sized device that will do something good for their home planet and something very bad to the oceans on Earth. The hunt leads Dave to Gina (Elizabeth Banks) a pretty single mom and her young son Josh (Austyn Lind Myers) a bullied grade-schooler in need of a father figure. ""Meet Dave"" works best when helmer Brian Robbins working from a clever script by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett uses the f/x trickery relatively sparingly and allows Murphy to shine as the pics most special effect. His gracefully awkward body language in Daves early scenes recalls Steve Martins herky-jerky hilarity as the spiritually possessed lawyer in ""All of Me."" But even after the man-shaped spaceship adapts to ambulating Murphy remains amusing as Dave does his best to mimic the expressions and understand the language of Earthlings. Murphy works in a lower key but to good effect as the Captain a vaguely Brit-accented commander whos too busy to notice No. 3s romantic overtures. Love blooms only after they and other Nillians aboard Spaceship Dave are ""infected"" by the emotional and psychological characteristics of Earthlings. (As a security officer who gets in touch with his inner queen Pat Kilbane takes the sting out of a swishy caricature through sheer force of uproarious overplaying.) ""Meet Dave"" hits a speed bump in the third act when a humorless No. 2 (Ed Helms) wrestles command away from the Captain leading to a sequence that involves bright lights loud explosions and f/x flash. It seems entirely out of keeping with the rest of the pic but fortunately it doesnt last long. Production values are first-rate. But ""Meet Dave"" demonstrates the benefits of emphasizing a human touch over hardware when it comes to funny business.

That the man who can apparently do anything chose to do the deliberately offensive Norbit (a choice that lost him the Oscar so richly deserved for Dreamgirls) is a mystery beyond solution.Less mysterious is his follow-up. In Meet Dave family-friendly as a Fourth of July picnic Murphy and Norbit director Brian Robbins redeem themselves with a performance and scenario that might have been developed for Steve Martin.Its a charmer about inch-high salt-starved space aliens from planet Nill and their attempts to navigate New York and understand earthlings. They are led by Captain (Murphy) who pilots starship Dave a human-scale marionette (Murphy again).Operated by the Captain and a crew including the fetching Gabrielle Union Daves mission is to deploy a meteorite-like sponge that will suck up all salt in the Atlantic.To Gina (Elizabeth Banks) a widow he encounters and her son Josh (Austyn Myers) who has found the meteorite the stranger seems a little . . . strange. His delayed responses are interpreted as thoughtful or dreamy. Murphy is frighteningly funny at suggesting that Dave is a sophisticated piece of machinery occupied by a crew at cross purposes.The films warm humor relies on the physical comedy of this creature whose limbs and mouth are run by remote control. Wearing a a three-piece white suit that makes him resemble both a disco prince and Martin in his 70s stand-up act Murphys Dave stutters and stammers and herks and jerks and charms. Trying to smile he overdoes it and looks like a barracuda with an underbite. Trying to dance he underreaches and looks like a spastic robot.Murphys Captain a British-colonial version of Capt. Kirk sports a dove-gray Chairman Mao uniform clipped diction and a growing appreciation of all things human. For beneath the surface slapstick of the emotionless-aliens-on-a-mission Meet Dave is an endearing fable about how the species whose resources the aliens want to deplete inadvertently enrich the extraterrestrials lives. Meet Dave isnt great but its good enough. And it proves once again that Murphy can do anything - even a PG comedy in which he isnt a donkey.Meet Dave 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Brian Robbins.

That makes him perfect to play the robot hero of Meet Dave. Wandering through Manhattan (hes an alien machine searching for salt to save his planet) Murphy makes his face a blank slate but those popped eyes are almost iridescent and theres a hint of deviltry in his stone-featured Buster Keaton gaze. Meet Dave resurrects the gambit of the inside-the-human-body segment of Woody Allens 1974 Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex...But Were Afraid to Ask Murphys robot who picks up the name Dave is a spaceship run by tiny technicians each devoted to one section of the body -- and led by a captain played by Murphy with an absurdly proper British accent. When the captain speaks his words come out of Daves mouth and this leads to some funny scenes like when Dave imitates the handshakes and smiling ""Yeah""s of the guy hes meeting -- an acid send-up of fake American bonhomie. Dave is such a good mimic he becomes touching in his literal-minded innocence. Meet Dave leaps between the nimble and the crude (yes there are colon jokes) and when the crew members discover they have feelings it grows formulaic. But this unfairly maligned sci-fi comedy testifies that Eddie Murphy still has the gift of surprise.
