Comments (1) click to enlarge Everest 3D Recommended Video Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2015 Screenwriters William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy dramatize an ill-fated 1996 climbing expedition up Mount Everest (previously recounted in Jon Krakauers nonfiction book Into Thin Air) in which two teams encountered an unexpectedly severe blizzard and eight climbers died. The first half chronicles the climbers careful preparation for the ascent the measured ensemble drama showing how strangers can come to trust each other with their lives. For all the natural spectacle the characters are what hold ones attention and the large able cast includes Josh Brolin Jake Gyllenhaal Jason Clarke Emily Watson John Hawkes and Keira Knightley. The movies sense of group dynamics finely tuned suspense and attention to technical detail reminded me of Robert Aldrichs Flight of the Phoenix. Baltassar Kormakur (Contraband) directed.

By Anthony Lane Baltasar Kormakurs new movie is based on a 1996 expedition to the Himalayas.   Credit Illustration by Matt Taylor Climb every mountain. Such is the impulse that drives the dramatis personae of ""Everest"" who spend their days and their dollars tramping uphill until they run out of air. The bulk of the movie grounded in fact is set on and around Mt. Everest during an attempt on the summit in 1996. The man in charge is Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) who heads a company called Adventure Consultants. Leaving his pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) at home in New Zealand he leads a bunch of climbers to Nepal and onward to their destination--or as they might think of it their destiny. Theyre not rookies by any means but neither are they professionals and one strength of the film is the tension that springs from this uneasy status. If youre nearing the top and the clouds are closing in like an army and all your instincts are telling you to turn back but the fellow beside you has paid sixty-five thousand bucks and is damned if hes giving up now what do you do? The mountaineers are a mixed bag. We have Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a scrawny type who almost conquered Everest once before and who treats this effort like a high jumper as his final go. Asked what he does the rest of the time back in Seattle he says that he delivers mail. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is a Texan so mountain-mad that he hasnt even told his wife where he is just as a boozer will deny his presence at the bar. Then there is Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) who has climbed six of the Seven Summits (comprising the highest peak in each continent) and has left the tallest till last. Any of them could merit a whole movie as could Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) a friendly rival of Robs who is conducting his own clients toward the roof of the world. The one thing they all have in common I noticed is an indomitable urge to use the word ""summit"" as an intransitive verb. That takes guts. The dilemma of ""Everest"" is that the director Baltasar Kormakur cant quite decide which of these people--some brave some deluded others both--belongs at the heart of the tale. I wanted more of Boukreev (Ingvar Sigurdsson) who is so coolly acclimatized in body soul and breath that he can amble up the mountain without oxygen. Other viewers I suspect will be crestfallen to get so little Gyllenhaal for their money not only because hes the brightest star in the cast but because his dudeish character--the Imperturbable Snowman shaggy but chilled first seen sunbathing at seventeen thousand feet--has so much more to give and therefore so much to lose. Just to add to the pile Knightley and Emily Watson who plays the coordinator at base camp are given substantial scenes on the telephone during which their expressions betray a dread of mortally bad news plus the intense concentration required to maintain a New Zealand accent. ""Everest"" in short suffers from the same problem as Everest overcrowding. If Rob and Scott join forces melding their groups for the climactic ascent its because of the crush on the slopes with not enough gaps in the roster to reach the top. There is plenty of material for tragedy here yet the impression given by the film is less one of suffering and sorrow than one of sheer implacability and we are left as it were with a caution never bank on any hero for long because Everest will glance at human beings with their baggage of presumption and dust them off like crumbs. At one point a small herd of them comes to a crevasse. A steel ladder only just long enough is placed across it. The spikes on their boots slip on the frozen rungs. Below waiting to eat them is the void. If that sounds almost unbearable to watch get this ""Everest"" is in 3-D. The high priest of ""Black Mass"" is James Bulger (Johnny Depp) who ran the Winter Hill Gang in Boston from the mid-nineteen-seventies until he went on the lam in 1995. The core of Scott Coopers film is the rapport between Bulger known as Whitey and an F.B.I. agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who under the shroud of night proposes that Bulger become an informant for the bureau. This entails a delicate balance of power Bulger will lead Connolly and his fellow-agents to the prize they crave the Mafia and in return Bulger will be left alone to run his rackets. He likes the arrangement. There are complications. Bulger has a brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is a state senator and the proximity of government to organized crime is though occasionally useful something to be handled with care. Closeness indeed is a running theme of the movie. Associates of Bulger like Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and Steve Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) become as time rolls by men who know too much and although its great if Bulger keeps you near and trusts you it also means that he can reach out and shoot you in the head. Then there is his wife (Dakota Johnson) and son (Luke Ryan)--an angelic kid who admits to having hit another boy at school. The mistake his father tells him was not the hitting but the presence of observers the moral being ""If nobody sees it it didnt happen."" That sermon over the breakfast table may be the best thing in the movie. Its funny plausible harmless yet spiky with hints of danger and it doesnt outstay its welcome. So much else in ""Black Mass"" bows beneath the weight of the lugubrious and the dialogue by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth strains too hard for earthiness ""Youve got two weeks. And thats fucking it."" The profanity far from toughening the line trips up the beat. At the other extreme we get to watch Bulger as he helps an old lady with her groceries. Please. As with Martin Scorseses ""The Departed"" which also prowled the Bostonian badlands the question is How much longer must we subscribe as moviegoers to the sentimental brotherhood of violence? In its pomp stretching from ""The Godfather"" to ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and concluding with ""The Sopranos"" such kinship was thrilling to behold and the marriage of family values to corporate corruption was performed with a flourish of dark wit. The protestations of allegiance in ""Black Mass"" however have the hollow sound of a rote ""The streets taught me that you give and you get loyalty from your friends. And loyalty means a lot to me."" That is Connolly who grew up in the same neighborhood as the Bulger boys explaining his modus vivendi to his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). You cannot miss the skeptical scorn on her face and its true that the female characters do their best to put the moral brakes on the men but theres no mistaking the movies obsession with that loyalty or the cunning with which many scenes are designed--even rigged--to show the criminal fraternity as a closed loop. Look at the streets for example. Theres nobody on them. Thugs cruise around either to meet with other thugs or to be pulled over by a cop bearing a message from opposing thugs or to allow the thug whos driving to beat the bejesus out of the thug in the passenger seat. Where are the shoppers? Where are the noncriminal citizens out for a walk? Are they really affected by the internal jousting of the Mob any more than they would be by doctrinal disputes within a church? We are told that the Winter Hill boys planned to wrestle control of the local vending machines away from the Italians. Whoo. So now you know if you bought a Snickers in Boston in 1981 chances are that some of it belonged to Whitey Bulger. What you get from ""Black Mass"" finally will depend on what you make of Johnny Depp. His hair is pale and thin like dry grass and combed back over his crown. The eyes of gelatinous blue seem barely to belong to him; maybe Whitey stole them from the sockets of a guy he didnt like. His thin-mouthed meanness is on constant display yet I felt not threatened or cowed so much as impressed by an actor giving a master class in threat. Its pure Oscar bait. The comparison here is with Cagney--another compact figure more ebullient but equally fond of hopping from one genre to another. Depp fans will be amazed to see him drop the sweet eccentricity of Jack Sparrow for the sake of Bulger the brute but Cagney was more of a piece the savage slugging in his Warner Bros. gangster flicks was meted out with the verve of a song-and-dance man. The hoofer was present in the hoodlum. When he bunched a fist at Loretta Young in ""Taxi"" (1932) then kissed her lifted her chin and lightly pushed her face aside the whole thing took under a dozen seconds but all of him was packed into that space whereas the comparable scene in ""Black Mass"" when Whitey issues a warning to Marianne stroking her cheek and turning the caress into a throttle goes on and on as if we were too dumb to get the point. The movie is often absorbing and skillfully played but along with its snarling hero it doesnt have much time for ordinary folk. By the end like Marianne we are left gasping for air.

Despite the IMAX 3-D promotional gloss this is a movie that gets down to eye level with its characters -- a movie not of expanse but of close-quarters despair. Even when people plummet to their deaths the film treats it quietly modestly; the horror is in the no-big-deal-ness. As such Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again. Everest recounts the true-life tragedy in 1996 when a deadly blizzard and other mishaps led to what was then the deadliest day in Mt. Everests history. Numerous books and articles have retold the story including Jon Krakauers best-seller Into Thin Air. Those who know the events well -- and who remember the specific fates of the climbers involved -- may have a different response to the action of the film than those coming to it with little advance knowledge. The initiated may feel like theyre watching a sad deliberate march toward the inevitable; for others it may feel more like an adventure story gone horribly horribly tragic. Actually we have a term for those. Everest feels more like a disaster movie than anything else. And true to that genre this isnt about one or two guys trying to make it against the odds (as with Kormakurs wonderful 2012 film The Deep) but rather a whole group of people from different walks of life each dealing in his or her own way with a situation spiraling from bad to worse. So we start off with some conventional introductions Theres Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) the dedicated and ambitious entrepreneur who turned helping ordinary climbers scale Everest into a cottage industry with his company Adventure Consultants; theres Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) the stereotypically laid-back American (and Halls friendly competitor) whom we first see soaking up some sun at base camp; theres Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) the brash gung-ho Texan with a Dole for President T-shirt; and Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) the mild-mannered mailman whos climbing to inspire elementary-school kids back home. Thats just part of the dramatis personae. We also get Robs wife Jan Arnold (Keira Knightley) who would ordinarily be climbing with him but is now pregnant and stuck back home; and Becks wife Peach (Robin Wright) whose initial coolness toward her husband seems almost cruel. Then theres Krakauer himself (played by House of Cards Michael Kelly) who has come to write a magazine piece on Adventure Consultants. The promotional value of that article gives additional impetus for Hall to soldier on with the climb even though the weather forecast seems increasingly dire. Then of course theres the mountain itself. Throughout Everest is treated as both another character and an existential fact and the dialogue captures the foolhardy romantic fatalism of those who brave the elements for sport. ""The mountain makes its own weather"" were told. And ""The last word always belongs to the mountain."" Also ""We dont need competition between people There is competition between us and the mountain"" In fact that the mountain will always win is a constant. As the climbers go farther up were told theyre literally dying because ""human bodies werent meant to exist at the cruising altitude of a 747."" Even before the true chaos starts these men and women are already starting to fall apart -- moving thinking and talking slower. This isnt a journey of heroism; its a journey of faster and faster decay. Kormakur has a tough task here juggling an impressive number of characters at different stages of the climb. Compounding the difficulty is the fact that the film has to struggle with the elements almost as much as the people onscreen Its often hard to see the climbers faces and we have to make out who is who based on the color of their outfits. Kormakur shot in authentic locations -- both in and around Everest as well as the Italian Alps and Iceland -- dragging his actors and crew to some of the most remote places on Earth. But he hasnt turned that search for authenticity into a fetish The setting bears down on the performers and the characters and when the director shows us a vast expanse or a deadly cliff or an eerily approaching storm he always does it in context making sure to keep the actors in the frame. In his hands Everest becomes a film of intimate menace.

Photo Credit AP / Jasin Boland advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1996 dozens of competing climbers scale Mount Everest with disastrous results. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE A white-knuckle survival film with an outstanding cast. Shot partly on location. CAST Jason Clarke Josh Brolin John Hawkes Emily Watson LENGTH 201 The ill-fated 1996 expedition up Mount Everest is the subject of ""Everest"" Baltasar Kormakurs IMAX-sized adventure epic. Shot on location with a stellar ensemble cast its full of roaring avalanches screaming storms and white-knuckle moments set against an awe-inspiring backdrop. Its big-screen entertainment that packs a visceral punch. Its emotional impact though may sneak up on you. ""Everest"" recounts the same story as ""Into Thin Air"" Jon Krakauers best-selling book and though it isnt cited as the movies source the characters will be familiar to readers. Jason Clarke plays Rob Hall leader of Adventure Consultants whose latest clients are an intriguing mixed bag the wealthy Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) the humble mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) and Krakauer himself (Michael Kelly) among others. Thanks to Halls track record of success rival guides like Scott Fischer (a laid-back Jake Gyllenhaal) are starting to crowd in. It doesnt bode well A 29000-foot-tall mountain is not the best place for free-market competition. advertisement | advertise on newsday In many ways ""Everest"" is a throwback to the grand old disaster films of the 1970s like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Airport."" Occasionally it stumbles into some of the same pitfalls With so many characters jockeying for screen time -- Emily Watson and Sam Worthington play Halls base-camp commanders while Robin Wright and Keira Knightley play helpless spouses at home -- we can lose track of whos who. And spectacle of course takes precedence over all. Still what a spectacle Shot partly at the magnificent Himalayan mountain itself ""Everest"" puts you squarely in the ice-cold hell of it all. (It was also filmed in the Italian Alps and though youd never notice on stages at Englands Pinewood Studios.) And what a cast -- particularly Hawkes as the underdog Hansen and Brolin as Weathers whose big-money swagger hides a hole in his soul. They and others provide the movie with crucial human-scale moments. Krakauer once said his journey up Everest left him shaken for years suffering from something like PTSD. After watching ""Everest"" you may feel the same way.

"Everest | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; everest ) Everest (U.S/U.K./Iceland 2015) September 18 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mount Everest has been conquered. Since the day in 1953 when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first men to stand atop the summit thousands have successfully climbed the mountain. Their reasons for making the ascent are as varied as the climbers themselves but often have to do with proving something (to themselves or others) fulfilling a dream or inflating an ego.  Sometimes more than one of those things. On May 11 1996 however the dream became a nightmare from which eight climbers didnt awaken. Directed with powerful verisimilitude by Icelandic filmmaker Baltasar Kormakur Everest provides a condensed partially fictionalized chronology of how the mountain became executioner and tomb for five of those eight people. Everest is more disaster film than adventure yarn although it relies heavily on the man-versus-nature aspect of the situation. Unfortunately as is often the case with productions that focus on the struggle to survive against impossible odds the human elements are often shortchanged. In this case character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like were on the mountain. Unfortunately our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed. (The events chronicled in Everest were previously depicted in a 1998 documentary of the same name. David Brashears whose images comprised the earlier account is a minor character in this movie. Comparing the two - to the extent its fair to compare fiction and non-fiction - theres little doubt that the documentary is the better film both in terms of its visuals and its immediacy.) Everest opens with a sluggish first act characterized by the introduction of too many underdeveloped characters. For the most part they are identified by a defining trait or two. New Zealander Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is the leader of the expedition. He has a loving pregnant wife (Kiera Knightley) waiting at home for his return. His clients include Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) a wealthy Texan in a troubled marriage; Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly) a writer; Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a postman who has scrimped and saved to afford the trip; and Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) a woman who has previously achieved six of the Seven Summits. Also headed for the mountain is Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) the leader of a rival climbing group. Everest takes an inordinate amount of time to get the pieces in place. However once the group departs base camp and begins the ascent the film sloughs off its slow pace and transforms into a gripping tale of survival life and death. The movies final two-thirds detail the torturous difficulties encountered by the climbers as they strive to reach the so-called Death Zone and what happens to them on the descent when a blizzard sweeps in. There are several deaths one seemingly impossible survival and a harrowing helicopter rescue. The screenplay credited to William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy tries to tweak the audiences emotions by introducing some sentimentality but these efforts are largely ineffective. The mountain dominates everything including the existences of those who made foolish decisions in attempting to surmount it. Everests triumph lies in its ability to convey the difficulties and dangers of the journey. Climbing the mountain which stands at more than 29000 feet in height is no pleasure jaunt. Through a combination of on-location footage digital chicanery and in-studio filming Kormakur is able to replicate the climb with startling effectiveness. The big screen is helpful in amplifying Everests majesty - the visuals wont be as impressive viewed on a television or (worse) a tablet and/or phone. The 3-D on the other hand although not detrimental isnt used to good effect.  Its simply there an unnecessary add-on that does little beyond inflate the ticket price. Too bad its not available in 2-D IMAX. That would be the preferred format. Everest boasts an impressive cast but aside from Josh Brolin and Jason Clarke no one is tasked with giving an Oscar-worthy performance. Character-actor Clarke doesnt overwhelm with a memorable performance but his role is central and he has enough screen time that were likely to remember him. Brolin on the other hand brings energy to a thinly-written role. Everyone else does what theyre asked to do - Kiera Knightley Emily Watson (as Robs business partner) Jake Gyllenhaal and John Hawkes. Sam Worthington (as a climber involved in the rescue effort) and Robin Wright (as Becks wife) are superfluous. Everest may be many things but its not a showcase for the respected actors who appear in it. Everest is a different animal from a garden-variety disaster movie. Although some of the beats are the same the symphony is darker and more haunting. The true story aspect is one reason; the lack of reliance on genre tropes and cliches is another. Everest is not replete with hard-to-believe acts of heroism annoying kids and plucky pets. It also doesnt feature an unnecessary human bad guy; the mountain is sufficiently implacable adversary. And if Everest serves no other purpose it functions admirably as a deterrent to answering the age-old question of ""Why [climb the mountain]?"" with a glib ""Because its there.""

"Mob Deep Johnny Depps Black Mass and Climbing Everest << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Mob Deep Johnny Depps Black Mass and Climbing Everest Warner Bros. Movies September 18 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print I dont know what a murderous crime lord is supposed to look like but its not Johnny Depp. Can Depp be delicate? Yes. Frisky? Melancholy? Sure. Likely to enter an outdoor parking lot near the Boston Harbor with a shotgun and fire until two men are very dead? I dont think so. The makers of Black Mass seem to understand that theyve got a prettiness problem with Depp. They also want to be careful that in dramatizing the dirty doings of James ""Whitey"" Bulger they dont romanticize him. To that end theyve given Depp pale skin tight enough that it could flake at the merest expression of much beyond menace. Bulgers thinned hair has been slicked back into a shell and his crooked teeth appear to cast shadows on themselves. When he laughs -- barely half a hand is required to count the times -- youre staring into a cave. The color has even left his eyes. When the light catches them they sparkle like fish scales. Despite recent evidence to the contrary -- think junk like Transcendence and Mortdecai -- Depp isnt an ""I just sent you a fax"" sort of actor. But the movie doesnt take any chances; it makes Bulgers monstrosity literal. He looks like a supervillain who never got to finish transitioning to evil. Bulger was apparently a psychopath but he didnt look like he was ready to wreak havoc in Avengers 6. But the hair and makeup are smart. Theyre used to set apart the bad from both the worst and everyone else. One evening not far into the movie Whitey pays a visit to his little old Irish lady of a mother (Mary Klug). They play gin and his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) a state senator is there cooking her dinner. Youre searching the dining room for some sign of resemblance among these three and there is none. Cumberbatchs clammy but attentive beauty has nothing to do with the talking corpse at the head of the table. That doesnt feel accidental. Neither does the conception of Bulgers two closest henchmen Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane) who here is rotund and baleful and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) whos got prosthetic-looking skin big hair and a dogs loyalty. They could be in Abbott and Costello Meet the Wolf Man. The movie focuses on the years Bulger worked as an FBI informant from the mid-1970s until he fled Boston in the mid-1990s. A slickster agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) seduces him into the role. At the time the feds wanted to rid the city of the Italian mafia and Connolly sells his reluctant bosses -- one is Charles McGuire played inevitably by Kevin Bacon -- on Bulger. A happy (and not entirely accidental) consequence of these consultations for Bulger was that the demise of the Italian mob cleared a path for his Winter Hill Gang to dominate not only the vending-machine racket but to run drugs and arms too. Connolly and another agent John Morris (David Harbour) reap the most intimate spoils in money and trips and time with Whitey but you get the sense that the men are just two prominent for-examples of corruption within the agency. As the years pass theres comedy in McGuires flipping his lid whenever he wants to bring charges against the Winter Hill guys but realizes he cant because Bulgers protected. Theres more in Connollys almost adolescent prevaricating about the turpitude of his source. I have to say the acting here is much stronger and more soulful than I would have expected and not only from Depp. Hes played so many of these walking zombies that its surprising hes found yet another way to do it the daylight bogeyman. Hes not out for sympathy. People blanched after a premiere screening in Boston this week when Depp tried to make what sounded like a case for Bulgers humanity. And that may be how Depp got through this part but whats onscreen is cold-blooded. Flemmi was as brutal as Bulger but I really like what Cochrane does with his body here. One of the darkest moments involves Bulger strangling to death someone Flemmi claims to care about. When its over Bulger makes Flemmi and Weeks dispose of the body and Cochrane darkens Flemmis demeanor which was never bright to begin with. Theres a part for Peter Sarsgaard as the sort of jittery disposable two-bit crook these movies always cough up. Sarsgaard is among the last actors youd cast in a part that requires him to say ""I make my living in the streets."" But hes so wrong that hes almost right. Meanwhile the women here have nothing to do but hang around houses and hospitals. But Dakota Johnson Juno Temple and especially Julianne Nicholson -- as a baby mama floozie-junkie and a long-suffering FBI wife respectively -- apply themselves to thankless canned roles of actual people. (Nicholsons accent works but like spoken palimpsest; as U.S. attorney Fred Wyshak Corey Stolls suggests a 51st state only he knows about.) Edgertons physicality takes the movie. When hes strutting and strolling around the office or virtually floating to heaven as a cluster of agents sit in a conference room listening to a mafioso incriminate himself or speaking in a treble accent that exists in Boston but that Ive never heard in a movie because the degree of difficulty is high its like hes inventing some new kind of machismo. Hes a bull-cock. Who knows where he found that accent (hes from Australia) but hes found one of the most entertaining performances Ive seen all year. And more than anyone else in Black Mass hes free to stay on a cloud since the movies depiction of Connollys employer is nothing short of scathing. The coolness and detached sense of horror that director Scott Cooper furnishes comes right from the source material the 2000 book Black Mass The Irish Mob the FBI and a Devils Deal by Dick Lehr and Gerard ONeill two former reporters for the Boston Globe. Most of the lighting is sepulchral and the pacing is funereal. Death is just about everywhere in this version of Boston which makes it close to almost every version of Boston filmed in the past dozen years. (The Heats an exception; its also a law-enforcement comedy.) The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi keeps its head lurking slowly to and fro. This is a leap forward for Cooper whose last movie was 2013s Out of the Furnace a testosterone-soaked tour de force of working-class phoniness. Hes decided to be a stylist -- which is something to be grateful for -- but Out of the Furnace was full of bad style. This time the declarative script which has been credited to Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk keeps the film on a moral tether. Theres only so far over the top his shotmaking can go before things turn glamorous before all of the allusions start rushing in. All the slow motion tracking moves and framing and wide and long shots are hauntingly descriptive In that strangulation sequence a shot in an apartment hallway with Bulger and his victim in the foreground slowly accommodates in the background one out-of-focus henchman then another. Takayanagi wants you to feel the sin. If youre going to dance with the devil the tune had better be a dirge.  Lionsgate It takes real balls to open your gangster movie in the same month that Martin Scorseses Goodfellas turns 25. But the sense of consequence of doom in Black Mass rebukes the high voltage and fun of Scorseses movie which is still an achievement of rhythm and tone. The camerawork and editing and framing still zing. The violence still shocks and time hasnt diminished the dread say of watching Karen Hill experience deep second thoughts about walking into an alley for a free coat -- no director has been more attuned to the importance of unnatural cinematic beats for even the possibility of murder. Even when you can anticipate a gun to the skull or a bag over the head youre surprised anyway. The movie remains this tremendous living breathing organism a fireman who turns out to be a stripper a jack springing from his box yeast. Its a classic but a distastefully besotted one. I could watch it every day of my life and thats not not a problem. Its unassailable as pop art but somewhat indefensible as a love story between a director and organized crime. But the level of stress at which this movie operates has never been topped by any crime opus and becomes its own form of caution. The movies legacy lingers quietly in some of the visual devices in Black Mass and boastfully shamefully on something like Narcos a show about the DEA and the Medellin cartel that began streaming last month on Netflix. Scorseses trapeze acts are tough to follow. Very few directors move the way he still can. He swings and pirouettes. Denis Villeneuve who also has a drug-war movie (Sicario) opening today pumps iron. Villeneuves movie is set on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border and tells the story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) whos been recruited by a beachy government asshole (Josh Brolin note-perfect) to help bring down a drug lord. On their side is a former prosecutor from Ciudad Juarez (Benicio Del Toro). Naturally the lady agent drowns in the moral murk while the dudes never lose sight of how the game is played. Looking like a man who has let go of himself as a survival tactic Del Toro really scares you. Hes got a speech at the end that points to the better movie this could have been. Aside from that performance and Roger Deakinss cinematography which is full of desert sizzle and searchlight-generated shadow Im not buying this movie; and Ive seen it twice. Mostly because Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan arent selling more than a tautological action movie with the dread and body count of a horror film. A friend and I were just saying about Villeneuve the other day that he really doesnt care what hes directing as long as it shows off his abs.  Universal Pictures Thats almost true of Baltasar Kormakur but he also seems capable of yoga or Krav Maga. Hes directed Everest which also opens today. (People the gym is crowded this week) Hes from Iceland and his Hollywood action thrillers include the enjoyably nasty Contraband and the proudly cynical 2 Guns. Written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy the movies based on the 1996 disaster at Mount Everest and was shot in 3-D and is worth seeing in that format. It puts you dizzyingly close to impossible vistas but also right beside staggering death. It has a cast that operates at just the right levels of starriness to be credible. Brolin John Hawkes Naoko Mori and Michael Kelly playing the journalist Jon Krakauer whose bestseller Into Thin Air was based on this trip are the civilian climbers. Jason Clarke is the New Zealander Rob Hall whose company is leading them up the mountain. Sam Worthington and Martin Henderson work with him. Emily Watson runs the base camp; Elizabeth Debicki is by her side as the camps physician. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hotdog leader of a rival expedition group and he acts with less mustard relish and sauerkraut than youd predict. And on wife duty are Keira Knightley (for Clarke) Down Under and in Texas Robin Wright (for Brolin). Knightleys character is pregnant. Wright wears some of the most atrocious clothes youre ever going to see -- even for mid-90s Texas. The film devotes the first half to preparation for the climb and most of the second to the disaster. Throughout the filmmakers keep you aware of the elevation and the time of day and how much reaching the summit means for the civilian climbers. Mick Audsleys editing proves as crucial to your absorption as what the daring cinematographer Salvatore Totino and the stunt and effects teams come up with. The toggling between the base and various points along the way to the summit becomes stressful then heartbreaking. Macho-ness doesnt preoccupy Kormakurs two other American films as much as money and the criminal motivation to acquire and spend it. Motivation starts to matter here just less crudely and more majestically. Within 30 minutes of everyone meeting each other and sharing their stories I became fascinated by what could have drawn them up there. Krakauer even asks this one night before things turn grim and never receives a truly satisfying answer. Kormakur makes you feel the existential wonder relentless risk and spiritual exaltation of the climb. When one character gets a hand on the summits peak he doesnt want to leave. Hes done something close to impossible and achieving that might be better than living to tell people you did. But I left feeling a Werner Herzog kind of churlish. Failure always feels inexorable in this movie and the mystical touches toward the end suggest that Kormakur doesnt disagree. Nature never loses.

But getting to the top is only half of it. Maybe even less. Thats what Rob Hall tells the groups of mountaineers he leads on pricey expeditions. You dont pay me for getting you up there he explains. You pay me for getting you down again -- alive. And this year man are some of them going to be glad they spent that money. And is he going to earn it. Based on the same trek Jon Krakauer wrote about in ""Into Thin Air"" ""Everest"" is the story of a fateful expedition up that impressive natural wonder. Its full of ice and snow pain and frostbite. Death too. And survival. What its not rich with are characters. Director Baltasar Kormakur - who filmed the movie in Nepal the Alps and various soundstages - gets some inspiring shots. And while he doesnt use the 3D to full effect theres one great vertiginous sequence with Josh Brolin trying to get across a very spindly bridge. But what gets us invested in a movie like this are the people and they never become more than sketches. Jason Clarke - who even playing a good guy gives off a creep vibe - is the paternal guide. Brolin - coasting on his accent from ""W"" - is a bullheaded Texan. John Hawkes looking as consumptive as ever is a climber with shaky health but determination. Jake Gyllenhaal is a groovy rival guide who sports a man bun and loves his whiskey. You get the feeling that all of them - Gyllenhaal in particular - have created rich backstories for their characters but little of that comes through on the screen. (Of course it doesnt help that between their oxygen masks - and the howling wind - we often cant tell whos talking or even what theyre saying.) ""Everest"" is one of the first of a long-line of big Fall movies that are based on true stories. Perhaps thats its chief problem. If it had the freedom of fiction we could get a real rivalry between Clarke and Gyllenhaal. Or a female protagonist (although two women are on the climb most of the actresses here spend their time on the phone crying silently). Or anything but one scene after another of guys in parkas trudging through the snow. Instead its forced to stick to the facts - and while theyre tragic ones theyre not very dramatic ones. A lot of people go on a dangerous adventure for not very clear reasons. Things go wrong. Some of them dont come back. Theres a story here to be sure; Krakauer certainly found it. But ""Everest"" is nothing but a long slow climb. Without any peaks. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and graphic images. Everest (PG-13) Universal (121min.) Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. With Jake Gyllenhaal Josh Brolin Jason Clarke. Now playing in New Jersey.   Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Baltasar Kormakur Written by William Nicholson Simon Beaufoy Starring Jason Clarke Emily Watson Keira Knightley Jake Gyllenhaal Classification PG Country U.K. USA Iceland Language English There are those for whom Mount Everest has become a symbol of folly its ascent an act of extreme hubris unnecessarily endangering human lives. And there are those for whom its there.Wisely Everest is a movie that doesnt take sides. Indeed if it werent for the looming score and breathtaking mountain scenery (shot in 3-D of course) this film might seem like an almost clinical approach to the infamous climbing season of 1996 during which eight climbers died in one day. Step by ominous step it takes the sweaty-palmed viewer through the series of miscalculations mishaps and misfortunes that stranded oxygen-deprived climbers in a snowstorm on the way down from the summit. There is not so much suspense here as there is very high anxiety. Video Video Jake Gyllenhaal lends his star presence to Venice Film Festival Jake Gyllenhaal Getty Images for Grey Goose Vodka Multimedia Shinan Govani Having Jake Gyllenhaal at the party may beat actually rubbing elbows with him Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star in Star Wars The Force Awakens which comes out Dec. 18. Fall Film Preview Whats on offer this fall on the big screen Many people know the story from Jon Krakauers bestseller Into Thin Air although this film is not affiliated with the book and there are several other (sometimes conflicting) first-person accounts of the events of May 10 and 11 1996. The script by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy prunes out details (and climbers) to focus on a few key figures in the team lead by Adventure Consultants and Rob Hall the New Zealand guide who pioneered commercial climbing expeditions on Everest.Sympathetically played by Jason Clarke Hall is portrayed as a natural leader and expert climber dedicated to the safety of his clients even at great risk to himself but the film does not lionize him making it clear that commercial climbing is the culprit in the disaster as much as weather The narrow route to the summit was so crowded that day that climbers lost precious time at bottlenecks.And as rival guide Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) points out in one key exchange Hall is hand-holding on Everest. His group includes clients who have limited experience with high altitude climbing and lack his physical stamina but still have expectations - at 65000 (U.S.) a head - that he will deliver the summit to them. Beck Weathers the brash Texan who goes partially blind on the way up but proves surprisingly resilient in the end typifies the problem Josh Brolin plays him as the quintessential American tourist determined that every locality should bend to his will and his wallet.Theres also Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) just an average American mailman who is working three jobs to pay for this trip - and who didnt quite make it to the top the previous year adding extra pressure for Hall. Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) is the one female climber a surprisingly modest Japanese woman who has already notched up the other six of the worlds top seven summits.And then there is Krakauer himself (Michael Kelly) on assignment for an adventure magazine. He asks the why question early in the film and doesnt get many good answers.Even if viewers dont remember the exact details most will recall the expedition went badly The first half of the film is excruciatingly tense with our foreknowledge. Director Baltasar Kormakur and cinematographer Salvatore Totino deliver the jaw-dropping mountain scenery and vertiginous overhead views but theres little emotional space to enjoy the grandeur especially as Dario Marianellis overwrought score keeps intruding.The music often seems out of sync with the otherwise restrained direction of the film Kormakur keeps a powerful ensemble working as an admirably integrated whole. By the time things are going wrong in the second half there are moments when its hard to follow the thread of events as desperate climbers bellow at each other through driving snow but the narrative line is crucially supported (as are the climbers themselves) by the folks back at base camp where Emily Watson delivers a particularly solid performance as the highly efficient head of operations Helen Wilton.Its a star-studded film with little room for star turns or sentimentality with the possible exception of Halls satellite call home to his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) - an actual occurrence that was always the most horribly sad detail of the disaster. There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave Everest is just there.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For those of us who dont even like to sit in the nosebleed seats at a theater for fear of toppling into the orchestra pit Everest is the closest were ever going to get to scaling the worlds largest mountain. Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie it does an effective job of conveying what its like to climb the mountain the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude. It takes a certain kind of person to want to risk their life--and strain their relationships and drain their savings--just to go through the physical and psychological torment of climbing Mount Everest. And while this movie explains the pain it doesnt do as good of a job explaining why its worth it. At one point a journalist played by House Of Cards Michael Kelly asks a group of climbers ""Why Everest?"" and gets a series of non-answers; if you get it you get it apparently. And if you dont this thrilling tale of survival might feel more like a death march.Everest boasts a whos who of scruffy white-guy actors including Terminator Genisys Jason Clarke as Rob Hall a friendly reassuring New Zealander whose company Adventure Consultants guides climbers to the top of Everest for 65000 a pop. From the start of the film--which dramatizes the disastrous May 1996 ascent documented in Jon Krakauers book Into Thin Air--emphasis is placed on three team members Doug (John Hawkes) a struggling mailman on his second attempt; Beck (Josh Brolin) a slow-talking Texan; and Yasuko (Naoko Mori) a Japanese woman who has climbed six of the worlds highest mountains. (Everest will be her seventh.) Under the Reality TV Principle the amount of humanizing screen time devoted to these characters means that they will either lose (die) or win (emerge as a hero) by the end of the movie. This principle is not inaccurate.Hall has become somewhat notorious among his more macho counterparts represented here by hippie daredevil Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and gruff Russian Anatoli Boukreev (Ingvar Sigurdsson). The other guides feel that Rob is cheapening the Everest experience by shepherding weak climbers who otherwise wouldnt be able to make it to the peak. But after some persuasion from Rob Scott and Anatoli agree to cooperate and the two teams make their final ascent on May 10 1996. That ascent begins with triumph in an emotional scene where the climbers plant their flags on the famous peak. But then disaster strikes--and oh how does it strike and strike and strike again--in the form of a freak snowstorm that strands several climbers atop the mountain. The blowing snow and cold-weather gear make whos facing which mortal danger obscure at points a problem director Baltasar Kormakur cleverly solves in the form of camp ""Mom"" Helen (Emily Watson) whose radio conversations help viewers follow whos where and in what state. At first with the fates of the different climbers unsure Everest is unbearably tense. But as the true consequences of the disaster become clear that tension dissolves into pummeling sadness amid tearful goodbyes and frozen corpses.The best argument in favor of what otherwise would be a pointlessly cruel loss of human life are the sweeping heart-stoppingly beautiful mountain vistas. (See this one in IMAX if you can.) Beginning with a helicopter shot of tiny hikers crossing a flimsy rope bridge over a huge canyon Everest boasts a handful of spectacular shots that show how small the climbers really are usually by panning from a team of struggling hikers to the vast craggy expanses beneath them. But those shots are relatively scarce and one of the most effective uses of IMAX comes early in the film where Beck nearly falls into a terrifyingly deep ice chasm while trying to cross it on a wobbly ladder. So while the mountain is referred to as a character in its own right--""The mountain makes its own weather"" Rob says at one point--its towering physical presence is ultimately overshadowed by the human drama. Maybe if we experienced less of the climbers suffering and more of the mountains majesty their sacrifices would be easier to understand.

Among an ensemble of fine actors including Josh Brolin and Keira Knightley the main focus is on Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal as expedition leaders Rob Hall and Scott Fischer. The two would count five fatalities between their parties by the end of the trip.There are gripping scenes of peril in the early going as an avalanche strikes and climbers cross icy crevasses on shaking strings of aluminum ladders. Theres a certain lack of buildup in these early scenes but thats because Kormakur is merely setting the table for the symphony of disaster that comes once the climbers reach the summit.If you werent already enthralled by the danger and natural splendor depicted in the first hour or so of the film the back half will rivet you as the fateful storm rolls in. The leads acquit themselves well in major emotional moments effectively underpinning a descent sequence already fraught with suspense as the climbers face down the possibility of death.Shot partly on location in Italys Dolomite Mountains this is one of those very very rare movies worth the price of an IMAX 3D ticket. Youll feel the sting of the snow shudder at the rumble of the wind and marvel at the audacity of the people insane enough to make this climb. ""Everest"" is a truly spectacular experience that deserves to be seen on the grandest scale possible.EverestGRADE A-Rated PG-13 for intense peril and disturbing imagesRunning time 121 minutes 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Kkl76W MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/17/movie-review-everest-avalanche-snowstorm-hiking-expedition/72372020/,200,everest(2015)10,everest(2015),detroitnews
"Review Everest gives an Imax-close but confusing account of 1996 disaster. - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Everest is a close look at 1996 disaster. Maybe too close. Everest Jasin Boland / Universal Pictures Jake Gyllenhaal left Michael Kelly and Josh Brolin in ""Everest."" Jake Gyllenhaal left Michael Kelly and Josh Brolin in ""Everest."" (Jasin Boland / Universal Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter The tale of mountaineering derring-do told in ""Everest"" would seem ideally suited for presentation in Imax 3-D and it is. Up to a point.Starring Jason Clarke Josh Brolin John Hawkes and Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur in that immersive format this story of a day in 1996 that was one of the deadliest in climbing history showcases both the splendors and the limitations of that big-screen presentation. As shot by cinematographer Salvatore Totino ""Everest"" is rife with spectacular mountain vistas photographed either in Nepal or the Italian Alps (where much of the filming actually took place).SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Astonishing images of situations such as fixed ladders extended over bottomless crevices and aerial shots of flimsy bridges hovering above daunting chasms make the experience of high-altitude climbing look as terrifying as it is exhilarating which seems just about right. ""Everest"" definitely puts you on the mountain no questions asked. For Beck Weathers Everest takes me apart but a sense of humor keeps him together Josh Rottenberg Nearly 20 years later Beck Weathers speaks of May 10 1996 as ""the day that I died."" About 6 that evening Weathers a hard-charging 49-year-old Texas pathologist and experienced mountain climber became stranded in a blizzard on Mt. Everest at 26000 feet. Nearly blinded from the effects of... Nearly 20 years later Beck Weathers speaks of May 10 1996 as ""the day that I died."" About 6 that evening Weathers a hard-charging 49-year-old Texas pathologist and experienced mountain climber became stranded in a blizzard on Mt. Everest at 26000 feet. Nearly blinded from the effects of... (Josh Rottenberg) But as it turns out Imax 3-D works better for yaks than it does for people. Enormous close-ups of actors feel intrusive instead of involving as well as having the odd effect of underlining that the re-creations of the harrowing events on the mountain are not the real thing.Not helping is that the script by veteran screenwriters William Nicholson (""Gladiator"" ""Unbroken"") and Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""127 Hours"") is standard issue in terms of both drama and characterization with lines like ""Go or Ill cry"" making frequent appearances. Everest trailer Watch the trailer for ""Everest."" Watch the trailer for ""Everest."" See more videos And this despite the fact that ""Into Thin Air"" Jon Krakauers bestselling book about being a climber on that ill-fated 1996 expedition was noticeably well-written. Though Krakauer is a character in the film (hes played by Michael Kelly of ""House of Cards"") ""Everest"" is based on other source material and not on Krakauers book. Krakauer is in fact on everyones mind when ""Everest"" opens in New Zealand with the team from Adventure Consultants getting ready for the 1996 climbing season in the Himalayas.Headed by Rob Hall Adventure Consultants was a pioneer in getting amateur climbers (Krakauers book calls them ""Walter Mittys with Everest dreams"") to the top of the mountain.Hall excitedly tells Helen Wilton (Emily Watson) his base camp manager that Outside Magazine writer Krakauer who was previously going to describe an Everest climb with rival company Mountain Madness has switched firms and is going to climb with them a reversal that should be good for business.Clarke an Australian actor known for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" does some of the best work of his career as the capable and solicitous Hall a man who worries about his clients and Dr. Jan Arnold (Keira Knightley) the pregnant wife he is leaving behind to lead the Everest climb. ""Be back for the birth"" she tells him and he replies ""Try and stop me."" Yes its like that.First stop for everyone is Katmandu in Nepal where we meet the paying customers Adventure Consultants hopes to take to the top. These include the wonderfully named Beck Weathers (Brolin) a cocky Texan with an unflappable wife named Peaches (Robin Wright) back home and Doug Hansen (Hawkes) a completely ordinary mailman who just missed getting to the summit the year before.Because the amateur climbing business has skyrocketed Everest base camp is as busy as Times Square so much so that Hall decides to temporarily team up with his rival at Mountain Madness the ultra-charismatic but laid-back Scott Fischer (who else but Gyllenhaal).On that fateful May day on the mountain some problems like a terrible storm are acts of God but others are the product of human error and personality. Ego has led these climbers to Everest and ego ultimately makes it difficult for them to get back down safely.The real story ""Everest"" is based on is a complicated one and the film attempts to touch a lot of those bases maybe too many -- for instance giving a nod to climber Sandy Hill Pittman who became infamous for bringing an espresso machine to base camp.Once the push to the summit begins ""Everest"" suffers not only because it gives screen time to too many secondary characters but also because it becomes hard to tell all these people apart once they are bundled into their gear and covered in snow.Though there is heroism as well as love here because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about ""Everest"" is finally a sad story though not always a dramatically involving one. If youre looking for great mountain climbing films documentaries like ""Meru"" and ""The Summit"" will take you higher than ""Everest"" world-class visuals and all.Twitter KennethTuran------------EverestMPAA rating PG-13 for intense peril and disturbing imagesRunning time 2 hours 1 minutePlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Josh Brolin Jake Gyllenhaal Climbing Jason Clarke Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-everest-review-20150918-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,everest(2015)11,everest(2015),latimes

Denis Villeneuve Jake Gyllenhaal team up again for Enemy Everest is total bull says author Jon Krakauer Dont look down. There are perils ahead for theatre-goers who are afraid of heights - in IMAX 3D no less. Down the road is The Walk in which Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the French wire-walker who traversed the World Trade Center twin towers in the 70s. And this week theres Everest based on a 1996 expedition up the worlds highest peak that turned into one of the most disastrous in its history. In Everest a remarkably-stacked cast tells the story of a fatal event that seems to have been inevitable given the clusterfutz of expedition companies that had sprung up to take advantage of the short window of weather that makes the 30000 foot ascent even possible. For 65000 each these tourist/climbers bought the right to cross bottomless ice chasms on shaky horizontally-placed ladders sleep in tents on windy ice shelves begin a days ascent just after midnight if the weather dictates and suck on bottles of oxygen with increasing desperation as they inch ever closer to their insane dream. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) makes brilliant use of film tricks and footage in the lower altitudes of Everest itself as well as stand-in footage from the glaciers of Italys Val Senales to give those of us wholl never get there a convincing thrilling and disconcerting proxy experience of being literally on top of the world. With a harrowing story to tell and this many characters its a given that character development will be sketchy. The good news is that this cast is capable of turning a little into a lot. Jason Clarke (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) plays Rob Hall known to his fellow expedition guides as ""the best hand-holder on the mountain."" Josh Brolin is the thrill-seeking family man Beck Weathers (not a made up name). Rob and Beck are the only two characters whose families we actually meet. Theres also Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a blue-collar worker whose expedition fee was paid for by a fund-raising drive in his home town (and who is intent on planting a flag for some school kids) and Jake Gyllenhaal as guide Scott Fischer sort of a ""dude"" who climbs mountains rather than surf. Theres a lot of wasted talent on the formidable female side of the cast with most of them given nothing to do but worry. These include Emily Watson and Keira Knightley as the worriers down at the base camp and Robin Wright as Becks wife who worries back at home because Beck seems worried for the first time in his climbing career. The only woman climber in the ill-fated expedition Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) is similarly short of lines in her case ostensibly because of the language barrier. As harrowing as are the events depicted Everest doesnt point a lot of fingers beyond how the danger was compounded through sheer numbers (Were told as many as 20 expedition companies operated there. The deaths affected two groups that merged mid-climb to alleviate the bottleneck). But flashlights radios and oxygen tanks aside as Clarkes character warns ""the mountain has the last word.""

So now you know whats coming. The first part of Baltasar Kormakurs version of the events recounted in John Krakauers bestseller Into Thin Air serves to introduce the players in general there is a direct proportion between how much you learn about someone and how much they are destined to suffer. (Its easier to care about a guy who needlessly risks his life when you know what hes chasing and what he stands to leave behind.) Also to lay out the various Things That Can Go Bad failed bodily systems frayed ropes depleted oxygen supplies bad weather etc. Also to introduce some interpersonal complications -- though none of them matter much in the end. As a Russian guide notes its the mountain that always has the last word. The second part covers the frustratingly slow ascent. The third is where the wind picks up and the bad stuff starts. Through it all the women wait by the phone.

Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures via AP Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com A feeling of tragic inevitability hangs over the peak of true-story action thriller Everest (B+) Sep. 17 2015 339pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh A feeling of tragic inevitability hangs over the peak of Everest accentuated by our knowledge that this wont end well. You dont need to have read Jon Krakauers nonfiction classic Into Thin Air to know this 1996 Everest expedition was ill-fated.As audience members were left to mentally check off the moments that sealed the climbers doom as they unfold onscreen No dont go up there Turn around You dont have to make it to the topIn this sense the handsomely mounted Everest plays like a horror movie with the part of the monster played by human hubris and nature red in tooth and claw. Its also a descendent of the big-budget disaster movies of the 1970s the ones with star-studded casts and sequence after sequence of tested mettle.Along for the journey are Josh Brolin (playing Dallas Beck Weathers) Jake Gyllenhaal Jason Clarke Keira Knightley John Hawkes Robin Wright Sam Worthington and Emily Watson. The climbing sequences which take up the bulk of the movie pack a visceral punch. Even before things go bad you feel every blast of wind and gasp for breath. Director Baltasar KormA!kur conjures an urgency that makes you realize how much you take for granted necessities like oxygen and rest. Everest reminds us how small we really are especially when you see it in Imax 3-D (the format in which Everest will be released on Sept.18; the standard version arrives next week).The actors manage to etch their personalities into the mountain no mean feat when youre covered in climbing gear and icicles. Clarke brings a fatherly pragmatism to expedition leader Rob Hall; he knows Everest is no place for sentimental gestures and you wince when he makes one that will clearly prove costly. Brolins Weathers is a cocky rogue with a personable side. Michael Kelly who plays political henchman Doug Stamper on House of Cards brings to Krakauer a wry writerly distance that cant withstand the panic and anguish that overtakes the entire enterprise.Its Krakauer who asks the question that must be asked the question that provoked the famous retort ""Because its there"" from Everest climber George Mallory. Why would you possibly want to do this? Different characters have different answers; Weathers hints at the black dog of depression that disappears when he climbs.Aside from this moment Everest is less concerned with the why than the what the hour-by-hour race against a nasty storm the desperate need for oxygen the brutal sting of frostbite. At its purest Everest delivers the lean naturalism of Jack Londons short story ""To Build a Fire."" Before long survival is all that matters. Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers in the film aEverest."" Universal Pictures via AP Away from the mountain tucked away comfortably at home but twisting with anxiety we find the loved ones. Wright and Knightley are the surrogates for those of us who feel right at home on the ground. They feel no compulsion to cheat death and they fret over what drives their husbands to do so. (The expedition includes one woman Yasuko Namba played by Naoko Mori.)Everest like nature passes no judgment. It shows us what these people did the price they paid and leaves us to wonder if those who didnt make it back might have had any regrets. EVEREST (B+)Directed by Baltasar KormA!kur.

"Everest is the lead actor in Jake Gyllenhaal nail-biter review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEverest is the lead actor in Jake Gyllenhaal nail-biter review The worlds highest mountain rises out of the 3D screen of Everest like a massive digit waved at the audience taunting who would dare to challenge its fearsome slopes of ice and rock.From left Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fischer Michael Kelly as Jon Krakauer and Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers in the film Everest.  (Jasin Boland / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 17 2015EverestStarring Jake Gyllenhaal Jason Clarke Josh Brolin John Hawkes Keira Knightley Emily Watson and Robin Wright. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. Opens Friday on IMAX screens throughout the GTA; expanding Sept. 25 to include regular screens. 121 minutes. PGThe worlds highest mountain rises out of the 3D screen of Everest like a massive digit waved at the audience taunting all who would dare to challenge its fearsome slopes of ice and rock.Mount Everest is really the unbilled lead actor of this nail-biting IMAX spectacular by Baltasar Kormakur (The Deep) a moody thespian at that and woe to any human who attempts to steal the spotlight.Article Continued Below""The last word always belongs to the mountain"" a character ominously says in this highly involving but occasionally frustrating dramatic retelling of a tragic 1996 alpine assault doomed by a snowstorm that left eight climbers dead and many others seriously injured and forever changed. So imposing is the mountain and so realistically rendered by Salvatore Totinos camera (plus CGI imaging) it threatens to dwarf any attempt to bring a human element to the tale.Jake Gyllenhaal and Jason Clarke play rival climbing pros who are attempting to turn a profit on leading wealthy climbers not all of them expert up the 29000 feet of the planets biggest bragging right. Gyllenhaals Scott Fischer is a bit of a daredevil an American cocky in his assurance that hes personally selected only clients with the right stuff to take Everest the type of guys who scoff at the need for bottled oxygen at an altitude were reminded is the cruising level of a 747.Clarkes Rob Hall is more serious and by-the-book dismissed as a ""hand-holder"" by Fischer who despite his conservative nature has perhaps unwisely taken on high-risk customers in the unsteady persons of Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) a defiant and irritable Texan and Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a postal worker making his second attempt at Everest who seems far from ready for extreme physical and psychological tests.Both men are angling to look good in the Outside magazine cover story planned by journalist/climber Jon Krakauer whose subsequent bestselling book Into Thin Air informs the screenplay by William Nicholson (Gladiator) and Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours).Women are supporting characters in this most macho of sagas although Halls team includes Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) who needs only to conquer Everest to complete her goal of climbing all seven of the worlds highest mountains. But good casting provides performances remembered beyond scant screen time Emily Watson as Helen Wilton Halls business partner and base camp manager; Keira Knightley as Halls pregnant wife Jan Arnold; and Robin Wright as Peach Weathers Becks disapproving but resourceful wife.The men may have the more dramatic moments of Everest but part of the wonder of the film is marvelling at how the mountain defeats even the strongest of actors. Hindered by equipment and face masks that make them appear as astronauts on the moon its very hard for them to fully register as individual characters.Its easy to lose track of people when the camera is revealing the most realistic and stunning of moments such as when the peak is revealed to be a tiny garbage dump of flags and other debris left by all the climbers who have followed the trail blazed by Everest pioneers Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Everest also serves as a blockbuster reminder of human hubris and lack of respect for Mother Nature.Small wonder that the mountain seems so hostile to humanity and so eager to upstage it on the big screen.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What defines a brave person? Deciding to climb the planets highest mountain? Making a career of guiding those optimistic high-altitude mountaineers? Staying married to people who make those wildly risky choices? In ""Everest"" a 3-D re-creation of the 1996 disaster that struck climbing teams pushing toward the Nepalese summit the implications are many. The questions are hard and the movie doesnt avoid them. The result is a man vs. nature epic more realistic than most. Under Baltasar Kormakurs assured direction ""Everest"" is a heart-pounding version of the old ""Jack and Jill"" poem that mothers often use to warn their children about heights. A crew of fine actors play the ascent teams -- mostly men -- making a shaky climb in pursuit of adventure. The film presents the ordeals of that dangerous sport vividly. Anyone troubled by images of vertigo snow blindness and hypothermia should proceed with caution. Everests peak a region above 26000 feet with scant oxygen murderous storms and free-fall cliff faces is called the Death Zone and not flippantly. The film documents the details of the tragedy in gripping detail. It treats the events which killed eight climbers without a touch of melodrama. Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal play expedition leaders Rob Hall and Scott Fischer. Hall is a wise and circumspect instructor for less-experienced climbers Fischer a skilled easygoing party animal rarely short of a grin or a whiskey. When we encounter him at the climbers base camp hes enjoying the summer sun shirtless as if it was his natural habitat. The two are among the leaders of the small industry devoted to bringing Westerners to the top and back down in safety. That camp itself is a reminder that there are no guarantees. Stone tombs are constructed there at the base as memorials for those whose bodies were lost too high for retrieval. Preparation for the journey involves weeks of acclimatizing planning and practice with pickaxes and aluminum work ladders serving as bridges across bottomless gorges. During that period we are introduced to the new arrivals in Katmandu some for the recognition it will bring them others for a sense of thrill or mastery or escape. They are real-life individuals who are lightly penciled in but compellingly played by interesting screen presences. Josh Brolin plays the Texan of the group Beck Weathers who sounds very Tommy Lee Jones and feels better climbing than hanging onto his troubled marriage by his fingers. John Hawkes is Doug Hansen a postman and veteran climber who worked three jobs and saved for years to climb Everest a privilege usually reserved for the very wealthy. Michael Kelly plays Jon Krakauer a journalist on assignment for Outside magazine whose account of the climb became the bestseller ""Into Thin Air."" One of the films best moments comes when Krakauer asks the others why they came there to walk to the top of this bleak treacherous terrain. A few chorus ""because its there."" Others offer confused smiles. What fascination does it hold for them? How could someone ask such a silly question? After a sacred ritual at a Nepalese monastery the climb begins in good weather proceeding -- slower than planned -- to the top. The blessings do not hold and a sense of moody slow-boiling anxiety begins to mount. The teams create traffic jams use incorrect routes slide and collide. A massive storm thunders on the mountain. They are hit by a brutal blizzard. They need oxygen canisters that the outfitters stationed along their route; a guide his judgment suffocating at that high altitude insists that the supply is empty. The lucky ones claw their way to life. Eight others cannot. Some die quickly some slowly. In one case death wins yet life deals another chance. Universal Pictures Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) leads an ill-fated expedition. Kormakur whose most notable films to date have been sophisticated police thrillers moves up a level here. ""Everest"" is an extraordinary true story told in a way that is exciting and cinematically flawless heartbreaking and soulful. It is stunning and saddening all at once. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Director Baltasar Kormakurs film ""Everest"" chronicles climbers attempts to reach the summit of Mount Everest under harrowing conditions. (Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan September 17 2015 In ""Everest"" climbers are shown trudging past the frozen corpses of the mountains previous victims some 200 of which remain along the route to the top of the worlds highest peak. We also see them walking past fellow climbers who are doubled over in agony as they vomit up blood. And thats just during the dry runs -- the preliminary partial ascents in which high-altitude mountaineering enthusiasts acclimatize themselves to the cold temperatures and thin oxygen in the weeks before they attempt the summit. Things dont get better only bigger more in-your-face and more stomach-churning in director Baltasar Kormakurs dramatization of the 1996 disaster that claimed eight lives on Mount Everest. Filmed in Imax 3-D the movie is an orgy of suffering a powerfully affecting experience that you feel with your gut more than with your emotions. Im not sure whether that is a good thing or whether the feeling constitutes enjoyment. Even if you didnt know the outcome of the controversial climb -- which involved too many competing commercial expeditions hubris judgment lapses bad weather and communications failures -- the movie plays out like a foregone conclusion as things move from bad to worse with the steady dirgelike drumbeat of a funeral march. There are movies about hair-raising exploits that end well but this isnt one of them. A foreshadowing of doom hangs over the film like the bulge of glacial ice that came crashing down from Everests West Shoulder last year killing 16 sherpas. ""Everest"" focuses mainly on two of the many teams that were being led up the mountain 19 years ago one captained by New Zealander Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) a by-the-book guide and the other by American Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) a long-haired mountain hippie with a more laid-back attitude. As in life Halls group includes the outdoor writer Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly) who wrote a 1997 bestseller about the tragedy ""Into Thin Air"" and several other amateurs a blustering Texan (Josh Brolin); a soft-spoken small-town mailman (John Hawkes); and a Japanese woman (Naoko Mori) who had previously scaled the other six peaks in what are known as the Seven Summits the highest mountains on each continent. [Scaling Everest] Although the screenplay by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy makes a perfunctory effort to turn those characters into people we can care about that quickly falls by the wayside of this tale which is more concerned with missing rope lines empty oxygen canisters and injections of dexamethasone a steroid used to prevent potentially fatal conditions common among high-altitude climbers. Its an impressively technical film with a visceral impact that is not interested in -- or at least not capable of -- moving the audience deeply despite side stories about Halls pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) or the schoolkids back home who are rooting for the mailman. In any event once the action gets underway its nearly impossible to tell who is who or even what theyre saying as the characters are buried under parkas and visors. Many of the climbing sequences which are truly harrowing are shot either at night or in howling winds and their location on the mountain is unclear. Because several of the characters -- who also include a Russian some South Africans and several Nepalese sherpas -- have thick accents the dialogue is often unintelligible. Despite frequent radio updates given in the script courtesy of Emily Watson who plays the base camp manager ""Everest"" will be confusing to anyone who hasnt read Krakauers book or the many other accounts of the disaster. ""Everest"" gets several things right but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain. Krakauers character asks several climbers why they are doing what theyre doing but the answers he gets -- because its there; because its rare; because it cures depression -- seem as unsatisfactory to us as they do to him. ""He might as well be on the moon"" says Knightleys character about her husband when Rob is stranded by the storm just below the mountains summit. Thats true of everyone in this rousing but ultimately unreachable adventure story. I walked out of the theater with a knot in my stomach the size of a fist but with a dry eye. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains scenes of intense peril and disturbing images. 122 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal Jason Clarke John Hawkes Josh Brolin Robin Wright and Keira Knightley. The film is about the 1996 story of when several climbers climbed Mount Everest. It is the story of their adventure. This powerful film opens on September 18 2015. (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Baby its cold outside. It sounds bizarre considering ""Everest"" -- a fairly good extremely grueling movie as far as it goes -- tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesnt go far enough.In May 1996 eight climbers died on Mount Everest three on the north face under circumstances less known to the outside world and five others on the south face in a far more extensively documented series of unfortunate events. (They were hardly alone; at least 35 climbers died in 2014 and 2015.) One of the best-known accounts of the 1996 disaster is Jon Krakauers ""Into Thin Air""; Krakauer himself who was writing about the experience for Outside magazine emerges as a supporting character played by Michael Kelly. The script by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy hangs its telling on the peg of expedition leader Rob Hall a New Zealander portrayed by Jason Clarke in a rare sympathetic role. Halls company Adventure Consultants was among the first expedition outfits to turn Everest into a weirdly crowded destination for extreme-risk and extreme-cost climbers. In the film one of Halls eight clients a Texan in a Dole/Kemp T-shirt named Beck Weathers played by Josh Brolin grumbles about the 65000 price tag.Along with Weathers Halls group includes star journalist Krakauer (Kelly); Seattle mail carrier Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) whose coughing spells indicate serious troubles ahead; and from Japan Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) whos already claimed six of the seven continental summits and has one more to go. Jake Gyllenhaal takes the role of another climbing company leader Scott Fischer of Mountain Madness. In one of a series of prologue title cards we learn that 20 expeditions were attempting to summit the peak in the same two-week window. The screenplay as directed by Icelandic native Baltasar Kormakur (""2 Guns"" ""Contraband"") lays out the perils and the geography efficiently and well. Expedition coordinator Helen Wilton handled with warm concern by Emily Watson monitors the increasingly horrific weather from the base camp while Hall and company cope with oxygen deprivation insufficient hiking ropes and worse. Once above the ""death zone"" at 26000 feet its pure bodily hell for the climbers even in optimum conditions. But a freak storm enters the scene and every so often someone reminds us of Everests indomitable ability to kill.

(Entertainment Tonight) Everest crew fought avalanches while filming movie about worst tragedy ever on mountain. The cast got a taste of just how challenging Everest can be while making a movie about the worst tragedy in the mountains history. Aug. 25 2015. (Entertainment Tonight) See more videos Shot in Nepal and the Italian Alps the film does several things right. It doesnt pump itself up with triumphalism when someone makes it to the top. Nor does it treat the deaths of the climbers in baldly melodramatic terms; twice we see characters slip out of frame down down down but its bracingly matter-of-fact scored by composer Dario Marianelli in somber mournful tones. The actings consistently solid.Yet even before the air gets fatally thin the thinness of the characterizations presents a liability. Screenwriters Nicholson and Beaufoy were after a lean purposeful procedural even as they occasionally drop in on the predicaments faced by Halls pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) and Weathers spouse (Robin Wright) back home. Director Kormakur is smart not to turn this story into a gorgeous Imax travelogue. But the results feels timid afraid to express a strong viewpoint or opinion or contrasting viewpoints on what went wrong.Theres a much better movie also dealing with traffic jams on Everest and the whole business of insane-risk tourism making the festival rounds Jennifer Peedoms ""Sherpa."" Vividly and with a sure sense of intimate human drama it pays attention to the mountaineers barely acknowledged in movies such as ""Everest.""

(Universal Pictures via AP) Photo AP Everest visuals soar as storytelling enters thin air 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The 1996 Mount Everest disaster made for a harrowing book Jon Krakauers ""Into Thin Air"" which took a cold and clinical look at one of the deadliest days in mountain-climbing history. The feature film ""Everest"" provides soaring visuals but its a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact. In their attempt to keep the facts straight yet still tell a mainstream-friendly story the filmmakers are forced into compromises. The Everest tragedy was full of drama but nothing about it was tidy. ""Everest"" follows members of the Adventure Consultants climbing team one of several jammed on Everest in 1996 when a rogue storm materialized as many in the group were summiting the mountain. The leader is Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) whose charges include Texan doctor Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) a mail carrier (John Hawkes) and journalist Krakauer (Michael Kelly). Real-life accounts have differed about exactly what went wrong and who if anyone contributed to the tragedy. ""Everest"" writers William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy take the safest passage offering only the vaguest explanations and then trying to compensate for those gaps with standard disaster movie heroic turns. But the choice to frame the film in inspirational terms is problematic too as some of the most selfless acts in the 1996 disaster were arguably punished. Moviegoers who think the makers of ""Everest"" were leading them to a Hollywood ending may walk away disappointed. Director Baltasar Kormakur masters the visual aspects of the film; the special effects are mostly seamless. The 1998 ""Everest"" Imax documentary remains the most striking account of the 1996 disaster but this new ""Everest"" feature successfully uses several locations (including the real thing) to build a realistic Mount Everest. The ""Everest"" story team successfully leads an Everest 101 course in the first 30 minutes explaining the risks and motivations of the climbers. Clarke is a reassuring force as the meticulous Hall while Jake Gyllenhaal offers counterpoint as the shaggier guide Scott Fischer. Most movies of this caliber would only offer one top-flight actress whose talents are wasted standing by the phone fretting or weeping. ""Everest"" gives us three Robin Wright Emily Watson and Keira Knightley. (More time should have gone to Naoko Mori as Yasuko Namba the pioneering female climber from Japan who got caught in the storm.) As the situation quickly turns deadly Kormakur never quite latches on to the dramatic momentum. The pacing problems are compounded by some confusion over mistakes that were made and a difficulty identifying actors through the blizzard. Much like the survivors back at base camp its hard to tell which of the characters weve invested in are living or dying. In the end theres a desire to run to Krakauers book and other sources about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster to fill in the gaps. Thats probably where we all should have started in the first place.

(Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures via AP) AP Everest is a harrowing spectacle that lacks emotion By Lindsey Bahr Associated Press Sep 17 2015 (...) Jasin Boland (From left) Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Kelly and Josh Brolin in ""Everest."" (Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures via AP) Jasin Boland Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers in the film ""Everest."" (Jasin Boland/Universal Pictures via AP) ""Everest"" is not an easy movie to watch. No entertainment that contains such tragedy should be.The truly breathtaking spectacle and technical achievements can make you feel like you too are on a vertical slope at 29000 feet. But this awe-inspiring movie is also one thats laced with dread little triumph and even less perspective as you wait with a knotted stomach for the disasters to manifest.""Everest"" recounts the events of and leading up to May 10 1996 when a series of controversial decisions and a heap of bad luck led to the deaths of eight climbers -- then the deadliest day in Everest history. It is not however based on the most famous account journalist Jon Krakauers book ""Into Thin Air."" Its an amalgamation of stories reports and never-before-heard tapes from the day focused mostly though on Adventure Consultants lead Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Texan climber Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin).Krakauer is a character in ""Everest"" (""House of Cards"" Michael Kelly) but a peripheral underdeveloped one. His presence as a journalist covering the expedition frames the growing tension between customer service and safety inherent in the commercialization of adventure. The script also uses him as a ""why climb"" observer. He can bluntly ask what the audience is thinking and he does at one point. The scene goes nowhere though. The other characters crack wise or choose silence as though the desire to climb Everest is so unexplainable. ""Because its there"" they say.So when a handful of climbers makes it to the peak its harder to feel their euphoria. All we see is looming death. Thats part of the problem of ""Everest."" All the elements are there but the emotions never land -- even with the inclusion of previously private conversation between Rob Hall and his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) as his plight atop the mountain becomes direr.Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (""2 Guns"") wrangles the story characters and beastly natural setting as best he can. The film trots along briskly and hits beats with sitcom precision as we go from sea level to base camp to the ultimate ascent. There is some levity too thanks to Jake Gyllenhaals earthy expedition leader Scott Fischer but mostly blunt foreboding. Fictionalized accounts of real tragedy are not impenetrable. James Cameron made us feel for a ship full of characters wed never met. ""Everest"" cant break that seal and its a handicap. Maybe theres too much reverence. Maybe the story and the truth are supposed to be enough and anything else would have seemed exploitative.

VPCBaltasar Kormakurs film about the doomed 1996 expedition of Everest is a visual wonder. But despite a great cast the film lacks character development and a stronger narrative.Josh Brolin plays one of the climbers in ""Everest"" which is based on a true story.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Baltasar Kormakur is good at depicting the enormity of nature.All the actors are accomplished enough to at least try to do a lot with a little. Good thing.""Everest"" is a sprawling mess of a movie one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good.Its certainly visually stunning with director Baltasar Kormakur ably showing us the harrowing journey that ended in disaster for the groups trying to make the summit of Earths highest peak in 1996. Yet for a film based in fact its strangely light in the humanity department. A huge cast of characters that includes Jason Clarke John Hawkes Emily Watson Sam Worthington Josh Brolin Jake Gyllenhaal and Keira Knightley struggles to gain traction -- theres too much of everyone to go around.Rob Hall (Clarke) we learn pioneered the idea of leading tours up Mount Everest and he was good at it. By 1996 however it was a crowded field with logjams at various points along the climb causing delays that arent just annoying but dangerous -- or deadly.Hall and his group Adventure Consultants have targeted May 10 as the day they want to make the final ascent. The trouble is several other groups including Mountain Madness led by the more free-spirited Scott Fischer (Gyllenhaal) have selected the same date. Narrow passages and a limited climbing window wont accommodate crowds but thats basically what forms on the mountain.Reaching the top is just the beginning for the climbers in ""Everest."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Among Halls group Beck Weathers (Brolin) a boastful Texan whose braggadocio serves as a mask for different feelings; Doug Hansen (Hawkes) a mailman who just missed the peak the year before and has scrambled to get the money for another try; Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) trying to complete the Seven Summits (the highest peaks in all seven continents); and Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly) the journalist who chronicled the trip in the bestseller ""Into Thin Air"" (though the film is not based on his account).Meanwhile Halls wife Jan (Knightley) also a climber waits at home several months pregnant.With so many people theres no time for full character development so what we get we get in bite-size chunks. All the actors are accomplished enough to do a lot with a little or at least give it an honest effort. Good thing as theyre not given much to work with.AZCENTRALEverest An IMAX 3D Experience (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe story unfolds as the climbers arrive in Kathmandu Nepal. They mount shorter climbs to acclimate to altitude before beginning their final ascent. Hall and Fischer have agreed to work together for the final ascent. The climb is tricky enough by itself but some of the group is running behind schedule. A blizzard hits and the descent becomes the deadliest part of the expedition.Kormakur does a good job of portraying the immenseness of the storm of the mountain -- of nature and how man is dwarfed by it. Thats man in the universal sense. Men and women individually are difficult to identify in the chaos which robs the film of some of its power. We care about the group in a general sense of course; imagine how much stronger our feelings would be if we were more fully invested in each of the climbers.As it stands ""Everest"" succeeds somewhat as a straightforward adventure epic. Beyond that however it never quite reaches its peak.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

EntertainmentMovies Everest Conquering the beast at 26000 feet Originally published September 17 2015 at 100 am Updated September 17 2015 at 429 pm Jason Clarke plays climbing guide Rob Hall in ""Everest."" The film is based on the 1996 disaster in which eight climbers died. (Universal) With its rigorous attention to the technical details of mountain climbing and its sensitive handling of the characters relationships ""Everest"" has a you-are-there immediacy unmatched by previous movies about the highest mountain in the world. Rated 31/2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Its an unforgiving place Everest. Its a magnet for the daring drawing climbers from around the world who want to stand at the top of the world at 29035 feet and thereby prove to themselves they have the distilled essence of the right stuff. But up in the death zone above 26000 feet where oxygen is scarce temperatures are numbing the weather is treacherous and a single misstep can be a climbers last step thats where the mountains true nature manifests itself. Movie Review 1/2   Everest with Jason Clarke Josh Brolin John Hawkes and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur from a script by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. 121 minutes. PG-13 for intense peril and disturbing images. Several theaters. The mountain says New Zealand climbing guide Rob Hall (Jason Clark) in ""Everest"" is a ""beast."" ""The last word always belongs to the mountain"" another character declares. And it could be that director Baltasar Kormakurs feature ""Everest"" is the last word in movies about the mountain.

But Kormakurs ""Everest"" being shown in IMAX and 3-D at some locations is unique in the way it combines breathtaking visuals (some shot on the foothills of Everest itself others captured on the Senales Glacier in northern Italy) with the personal stories of those who challenged the mountain and in a number of cases died on its slopes. With its rigorous attention to the technical details of mountain climbing and its sensitive handling of the characters relationships it has a you-are-there immediacy unmatched by previous Everest movies. The cast is large and the picture is essentially an ensemble piece though the trials and travails of Hall Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a mailman making his second attempt to reach the summit and Texas physician Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) who suffers grievously from frostbite are prominently featured. Less prominent in the story is Scott Fischer founder of the Seattle-based Mountain Madness mountaineering service portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal with a sly ebullience thats in sharp contrast to Halls steady-as-she-goes nature. Halls devotion to his pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) and his careful shepherding of his climbing clients Hansens determination to realize his longtime dream of summiting the mountain and Weathers headstrong nature all make the characters memorable. When a huge sudden storm sweeps across the peak the picture becomes intensely riveting as the characters struggle to survive the mountains fury. In those scenes Everest truly becomes an implacable beast. Soren Andersen asoren7575yahoo.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

(Jasin Boland/universal) Jason Clarke as Rob Hall in ""Everest."" (universal) Jake Gyllenhaal goes for the peak as Scott Fischer in ""Everest."" (Jasin Boland/universal) BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday September 16 2015 219 PM Title ""Everest"" Film Info A mountain climb goes badly. Director Baltasar Kormakur (201). PG-13. Area theaters. In Imax where available. Like the mountain for which its named ""Everest"" is rock solid. Its big its beautiful its terrifying and its merciless to both its characters and the audience. Based on a real 1996 expedition that claimed eight lives Baltasar Kormakurs film spends its first hour making a trip up the tallest mountain on Earth look like the adventure of a lifetime. It then spends its second hour convincing audiences to stay home and play checkers. No kidding There are shots here so convincing that youll feel like you have frostbite. Jason Clarke stars as Rob Hall an expert mountaineer leading a new batch of adventure tourists up the worlds highest peak -- and a deadly storm shows up at the worst possible moment. With their oxygen tanks empty the exhausted climbers must retreat down the already deadly mountain in whiteout conditions. As you watch you are reminded of the movie posters advisory ""Human beings were not meant to survive at the cruising altitude of a 747."" As individuals fall victim to the elements the climbers must make a choice Do they hunker down and try to survive or risk death to save others? Not everyone gets out alive. The actors playing Halls customers and colleagues -- including an eccentric Jake Gyllenhaal a cocky Josh Brolin a gentle John Hawkes and the usually blank Sam Worthington -- all get a chance to try out their best ""freezing to death"" faces. The ladies in the cast unfortunately have less to do with wives and girlfriends Keira Knightley Emily Watson and Robin Wright spending the bulk of their screen time looking worried while standing next to telephones. Kormakur (""Contraband"" ""2 Guns"") takes his time getting to the tragedy and chaos. Its only after the characters have been thoroughly briefed on the details of scaling a 29029-foot mountain that things start to go wrong. This slow-burn approach works wonders for tension -- you dont notice just how badly the situation has unraveled until its too late. Jake Gyllenhaal (l.) and Jason Clarke on the mountain. (universal) Michael Kelly plays author Jon Krakauer in ""Everest."" (universal) Jason Clarke leads a climb in ""Everest."" (universal) The film is so harrowing that its easy to overlook its transgressions With a cast this big only a handful of performances are allowed to truly blossom. And the brutal deaths of certain characters will have audiences wondering ""Wait who was that guy again?"" The good news is the film is intense enough to numb the entire body. The bad news is that its not emotionally deep enough to freeze the heart. But it earns its fourth star because its so harrowing and intense. At the end of the day ""Everest"" is an old-fashioned meat-and-potatoes cinematic adventure aided and abetted by the best CGI money can buy. Make sure to bring a jacket.

Thats one question that wont be answered by Icelandic filmmaker Baltasar Kormakurs 3-D true-life climbing-disaster epic Everest which details -- from another point of view -- the tragic 1996 expedition previously chronicled by Jon Krakauer in his 1997 mega-bestseller Into Thin Air. (Krakauer appears as a character in the movie though his book is not the source for the script written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy.)Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal play rival guides who team up to lead climbers -- each of whom has paid a hefty sum -- right up to the tippy-top of this terrible invincible mountain. An unanticipated storm spells disaster. Who will die and who will survive? Whose pregnant wife will be hanging on the telephone waiting for word of whether or not her husband will survive? (Shes played by Keira Knightley.) Everest is visually splendid though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals. But as a picture about tragedy despair and snow its pretty effective The superb 3-D effects -- including craggy vistas clad in frosty white icing dangerously seductive in their beauty and yawning cracks that seem to drop into oblivion -- are likely to make you feel very small and insignificant in the context of nature and her merciless whimsy.If youve ever dreamed of climbing 29000 feet of mountain in unpredictable weather see Everest before you strap on those crampons.

Everest is an unrelenting real-life disaster movie that strands you near the top of the worlds tallest mountain and dares you to imagine what it must be like to be part of an expedition to the top going horribly horribly wrong. Its screenwriters William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy respectively have Gladiator and 127 Hours to their names and Everest combines the muscular sometimes sentimental force of the former with the sense of being party to an extreme physical endurance that made the latter so successful. Like Gravity another spectacle involving a conflict between humans and a hostile environment never meant for us Everest relies heavily on awe special effects and 3-D. Director Baltasar Kormakurs camera appears to glide just above the highest ridge of Everest a mass of rock snow and ice just as terrifying and mysterious as the vast blackness of outer space itself. Based on an actual trip to the summit in 1996 that ended in tragedy an air of doom hangs over Everest forcing you to wonder which of its endearing ensemble cast will make it down alive. The inevitability of death makes it all the more tough to watch. Who as mountaineering jargon has it will finish up ""gone""? Maybe John Hawkess gentle unassuming postman whose trip is part-funded by school kids? Or Josh Brolins millionaire family man from Texas? Or Jason Clarkes affable team leader? Or Jake Gyllenhaals extreme-sports dude? Hes emblematic of the mid-1990s globetrotting outsider culture which still saw Starbucks as cool and led to an explosion of commercial outfits operating on a crowded Everest. When were not squirming at the sight of deathly drops or feeling whipped by the weather were plunged into the emotional distress of those left behind wives played by Robin Wright and Keira Knightley and base camp coordinator Emily Watson whos manning a satellite phone halfway down the mountain. The film crosses into soppy territory when it forcefully begs our tears but Kormakur creates such a convincing world--the craft of this film is astonishing--that youre willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favor of a totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend to a place thats heaven one moment and hell the next.

But sneaking in right after the Labor Day deadline is Everest--a relentless 3-D workout where something is truly at stake the lives and deaths of real people. Its been almost two decades since the 1996 tragedy on Mount Everest when eight climbers died trying to return from its summit. That story was indelibly recounted by one of the expeditions survivors Jon Krakauer (played here by Michael Kelly) in his best-seller Into Thin Air. Krakauers book was harrowing cautionary and heartbreaking as it painted what it was like to fight for survival at 29000 feet. It was also full of the kind of human complexity and rich technical detail that no two-hour movie could reasonably match. Jason Clarke the ruggedly sensitive Australian star of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes heads up the films large cast as Rob Hall--the Kiwi mountaineer who ran a climbing outfit called Adventure Consultants which essentially made a business out of lugging weekend warriors with deep pockets up the tallest and deadliest peak on earth. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Halls rival guide Scott Fischer a macho laid-back American leading his own team up Everest in what would turn out to be a dangerously unpredictable and overcrowded season on the mountain. Kelly John Hawkes and a rootin-tootin Josh Brolin are just some of the cargo each with his own reason for wanting to reach the top that goes deeper than ""Because its there""--especially Hall who had a pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) waiting at home. It may sound cold to say that while all of the performances are solid its the danger of Everest thats the films primary lure. But no one pays IMAX ticket prices for nuanced human drama and the films dizzying climbing scenes and vertiginous dont-look-down moments are what give it its heart-quickening power. Shot in Nepal and Italy Everest makes you feel how mismatched and exposed even the strongest climber must have felt when a blizzard kicked up during this groups descent leaving them stranded and doomed. Baltasar Kormakur the director of the underappreciated 2 Guns stages all of the high-altitude chaos effectively if a bit too chaotically. At times its confusing (especially if you havent read Into Thin Air) whos where and whos still alive. Theyre just a sea of parkas. Maybe thats the point--that Mother Nature doesnt discriminate. But I doubt it. Plus it shouldnt be. When the lights come up you dont want to feel like youve watched a better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy youve just watched. Yes you want to be entertained but you also want the icy whipping wind of reality to sting.

Everest Avalanche One of the Great Loves of My Life Director Baltasar Kormakurs adventure epic has breathtaking moments of peril but too many characters make for an unsatisfying docudrama In collecting my impressions about ""Everest"" which opened this years Venice Film Festival I started thinking not about other epic adventure movies but about HBOs ""Show Me a Hero"" the recently-completed six-part miniseries about the battle over low-income housing in Yonkers New York. The two couldnt be further apart in terms of genre but both projects are true stories adapted from non-fiction. (Even though Jon Krakauer is a character in ""Everest"" this movie isnt an adaptation of ""Into Thin Air""; the credited sources are Beck Weathers ""Left for Dead My Journey Home from Everest"" and Peter Wilkinsons article ""The Death Zone."") In the case of ""Hero"" the lengthy running time allows us to get to know a variety of characters from the politicians and lawyers involved in creating public-housing policy to the residents of Yonkers (inside and outside of that public housing). See Video Jake Gyllenhaal Jason Clarke Fight for Survival in Everest Trailer ""Everest"" doesnt have the luxury of spreading out; in just about two hours screenwriters William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy have to bring to life some 20 major characters -- climbers support staff worried spouses rival expeditioners -- many of them spending big chunks of the movie covered in snow and wrapped up in parkas and sunglasses. This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character might have resulted in tighter storytelling. As it is the film feels like what happens when a studio exec barks ""Get me a Gravity"" That Oscar-winner -- like ""127 Hours"" ""Into the Wild"" and ""The Grey"" before it -- falls into a new category we might call the Intimate Disaster Epic. Whereas those movies all focused on one person caught up in extraordinary circumstances and fighting for survival ""Everest"" tries and fails to spin too many plates with more than a dozen characters desperate to make it down from one of the worlds most treacherous slopes. Each of those real-life climbers no doubt had an interesting story to tell but when shoved together like this theyre all reduced to types rather than people. We meet expedition leader Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) who we are told pioneered the idea of taking guided tours up the mountain. By 1996 when the film takes place there are any number of rival groups all competing to take Everest during a narrow window in May when ascent is even relatively possible given the severe weather in that part of the world. Leaving pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley struggling with a New Zealand accent) behind in New Zealand Rob troops off to Nepal with a team that includes Guy (Sam Worthington) Helen (Emily Watson) and doctor Caroline (Elizabeth Debicki shedding her couture glam from ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""). Also Read 25 Fall Movies Were Dying to See From Everest to The Hateful Eight Among the climbers in Robs group are Krakauer (Michael Kelly ""House of Cards"") Weathers (Josh Brolin) Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) and Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori). Each of these folks gets a mini-narrative -- Weathers only feels alive on a mountain peak but hes promised wife Peach (Robin Wright) that this is his last one; mailman Doug got close to the summit last year and is determined to go all the way; Yasuko has climbed six of the seven summits of Everest and wants a clean sweep - not unlike the all-star cast of something like ""Airport 1975."" Because of the logjam of mountaineers Rob teams up with American excursion leader Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) to share resources and experience but a perfect storm of impediments (including an actual storm) gathers to turn this trip into chaos. Soon everyone is clinging to life (and the mountain) and viewers not already informed about this story wont necessarily guess who lives and who dies. Also Read Jake Gyllenhaal-Naomi Watts Drama Demolition Set for 2016 Release That relative unpredictability is one of the strong suits of ""Everest"" along with making Knightleys and Wrights characters more than just wet-eyed wives sitting next to the phone. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino (""The Da Vinci Code"") knows how to move his camera around the 3D IMAX space to make audience members clutch their cup-holders as climbers teeter over treacherous crevasses and narrow cliffs. (One of his sweeping helicopter shots of the summit however gets used twice for no apparent reason.) Its when ""Everest"" stops trying to take our breath away and starts wanting us to care about the relationships between the characters that it falls short with at least one major player getting an off-screen death that undercuts any emotion we might feel about it. This fine ensemble of actors works hard to make individual moments land but once the wind whips up each character gets lost in a blizzard and is reduced to the color of their protective gear.

""Never let go"" pleads the tagline for ""Everest"" a bracing depiction of an ill-fated 1996 expedition to climb the Himalayan mountain. While that likely refers to the risky exploits depicted onscreen it could just as well serve as a mantra for woozy audiences enduring their own traumas through Baltasar Kormakurs nausea-inspiring adventure. Equal parts spectacle and harrowing survival tale ""Everest"" also serves as a kind of bid for the survival of the ever-imperiled moviegoing experience with the 3D IMAX-enhanced thrills masterfully engineered to bring its mountain-climbing fears to horrific light. Released in the same window of time as the documentary ""Meru"" another depiction of climbers struggling through the vertical Himalayan landscape ""Everest"" may not be the foremost realistic portrait of such a high stakes undertaking. However Kormakur -- aided by an unnerving and largely unsentimental screenplay by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy -- has undeniably magnified the visceral qualities of the trepidatious climb to great effect. Until now the Icelandic-born directors shift from eccentric character studies (""101 Reyjavik"" ""Jar City"") to studio projects suggested his interests had shifted to slick but disposable genre fare (""Contraband"" ""2 Guns"").  ""Everest"" is a far more ambitious attempt to fuse Hollywood wizardry with a genuine sense of dread. In the pantheon of recent brainy blockbusters it lacks the same constant surprises of last years ""Gravity"" or the visual poetry of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" but Kormakurs movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling. Much of the movies grim atmosphere stems from the source material In 1996 eight climbers died in the midst of a grueling unexpected storm that swept through the mountain with unyielding force. From that starting point Kormakur builds an engrossing depiction of the mountains unsympathetic terrain. The drama centers on a pair of competing tour groups one led by the stoic New Zealand mountaineer Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and the other by Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhaal grinning beneath a frosty beard). As an opening title card and ensuing conversations make clear the success of Hall and other foreign groups yielded a boom in commercial tours littered with amateur climbers plunking down thousands of dollars for the opportunity to reach the worlds highest peak. Among their clients Cocky Texan Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin on autopilot but a natural fit) an eager and pompous adventurer intent on getting his moneys worth and mailman Doug Hansen (an underutilized John Hawkes) intent on conquering the summit he failed a year earlier. In an early briefing session the men are warned that once reaching the top of the mountain ""you start to die."" But such freakish trivia only increases their eagerness. Until the sky grows dark and the wind picks up its hard to blame them Seamlessly blending green screen technology with sweeping mountain views ""Everest"" brings the ferocious climate to life in engrossing detail. That scale is a natural fit for hulking proportions of the IMAX screen. At times in fact Kormakur seems almost too enamored of the extraordinary vistas to spend much time with his characters. ""Everest"" constantly flits between terse expedition and the visual splendor of the snowy terrain. However those elements are mostly complimentary as tension builds. A perfunctory scene at the start of the movie when Hall leaves behind his pregnant wife (Keira Knightley) as he jets off for his dangerous mission winds up setting the stage for an emotionally draining third act. Similarly the obnoxious attitude of Texan climber Weathers suggests a discardable side character when in fact his unlikely resilience figures heavily in the hectic finale. Despite its behemoth scale ""Everest"" strains to juggle its massive ensemble. Most of the other climbers land hardly more than a line or two of dialogue. While Gyllenhaal gradually fades into a minor role Robin Wright -- as the stern wife of Brolins character -- barely lands more than a few minutes of screen time (though she makes them count). But the actors that do find opportunities to capture the sheer anxiety of their situation make them count. As the trenchant base camp operator Emily Watson conveys the helpless nature of the groups situation with her mounting looks of frustration as the clouds rush in and her walkie talkie can only do so much. Oscillating between expansive outdoor scenery and expressive closeups ""Everest"" maintains a clear-eyed cinematic depiction of dread. That tone has its limits reaching overwhelming proportions as the body count rises and rescue missions go awry but the movie remains an audiovisual marvel. The whooshing and crumbling effects go a long way toward enhancing the ongoing suspense unique to the setting where fleeting lightheadedness or the loose rungs of a latter can mean sudden death (some of the tilting camerawork means viewers should be wary of dizzy spells). Eventually the story finds its way to a tear-jerker finish enacted with sufficient restraint. With so many lethal factors in play its ironic that ""Everest"" features just one fleeting after hours scene where several mountaineers discuss their rationales for seeking the summit. During the brief moment of unsubtle banter ""Everest"" shows its commercial boundaries -- it couldnt simply get away with letting the ambiguity of the climbers motives dangle there like those ominous clouds circling the peaks. But thats exactly where it goes with the haunting images that comprise the movies inspired conclusion. While it pays homage to the sacred dimensions of the mountain ""Everest"" falls short of acknowledging its locals relegating the sherpas on the voyage to anonymous background figures. Beyond a brief early scene set at a Tibetan temple the movie shows little regard for the native culture. But that in itself taps into its traumatic aspects of the narrative imbuing it with shades of a horror movie where reckless kids venture into the woods and never return. In ""Everest"" the kids are backpack-clad thrill-seekers giddy with excitement about conquering the world until they get buried by it. Grade B+ ""Everest"" opens the Venice Film Festal today. It opens nationwide September 18.

Following the 2014 and 2015 avalanche disasters that killed more than 35 people trying to scale the highest mountain on Earth the timing is either wildly inappropriate or grimly right for ""Everest"" though it would be awfully hard to argue that its too soon. A properly grueling dramatization of the ill-fated May 1996 expedition that saw eight climbers expire in a blizzard this brusquely visualized choppily played epic serves as the latest cinematic opportunity for Mother Nature to flaunt her utter indifference to human survival. Achieving fitful flurries of emotion amid an otherwise slow agonizing descent into physical and dramatic paralysis director Baltasar Kormakurs latest and biggest U.S. studio effort should ride its Imax 3D event-picture status to decent theatrical returns worldwide aided by a topical resurgence of interest in the movies subject. Still with its more stolid than inspired execution its unclear whether the Sept. 18 Universal release can reach its desired commercial apex. With little still known about the three Indian climbers who died on the mountains north face on May 10-11 1996 ""Everest"" understandably focuses on the more widely documented experiences of the five who perished on the south face. No single source is cited as inspiration for the screenplay by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy (who know a thing or two about wilderness survival stories having co-written ""Unbroken"" and ""127 Hours"" respectively) though the press materials mention books written by two American survivors of the climb Jon Krakauers bestseller ""Into Thin Air"" and Beck Weathers ""Left for Dead My Journey Home From Everest."" A few other accounts were also published including ""The Climb"" by the Russian Kazakh mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev who disputed key details in Krakauers version of events. Still its Boukreev (played by Icelandic actor Ingvar Sigurdsson) who concedes the silliness of arguing about who did or said what. As he notes staring up at the 29029-foot-high colossus that awaits him and his fellow daredevils ""The mountain always has the last word."" Sharing that fundamental respect for the danger of their undertaking is New Zealander Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) the cautious leader of an expedition guiding company called Adventure Consultants which helped popularize the climbing of Mount Everest in the early 1990s. In April 1996 we see Hall bidding farewell to his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) and heading to Kathmandu to meet the eight clients hell be leading up Everest. They include Weathers (Josh Brolin) a Texas native who seems determined to conquer Everest on cocky charm alone; Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) a Japanese woman whos already got six of the Seven Summits under her belt; and Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) a humble Seattle mailman whos taking another stab at Everest having made it within a few hundred feet of the summit in 1995. Theres also Krakauer (Michael Kelly) a high-profile journalist whose presence is a source of some early tension between Hall and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal sporting a real nightcrawler of a beard) the leader of a competing expedition company called Mountain Madness. Hall tries to broker a truce and suggests the two teams join forces during the climb; much discussion ensues about important barely comprehensible matters involving fixed ropes and oxygen tanks. Meanwhile as both teams make their ascent from one mountain camp to the next the movie spits out so many rapid-fire destination names and altitude statistics that you wonder if any of it will be on the final. On a certain level though its clear that the shallowness of the character interplay and the sketchiness of the details hardly matter The mountain will settle everything soon enough. As the climbers acclimatize to conditions at the South Base Camp (17598 feet) Adventure Consultants coordinator Helen Wilton (Emily Watson) briefs them on the potential perils of their journey which we see illustrated in an effective bit of B-movie foreshadowing Climbers can lose motor function cough up blood and even succumb to a form of stealth hypothermia that makes them feel as if theyre burning up. A step above 8000 meters (26246 feet) will take them into the ""death zone"" a realm of pure entropy where their goal is to make it to the summit and back as quickly as possible lest they succumb to frigid temperatures tricky terrain and dangerously thin oxygen levels. ""Why climb Everest?"" Krakauer asks his teammates before they begin their big push upward and though we hear a few of their responses (i.e. ""It would be a crime not to"") the grim developments to come feel all but designed to frustrate a satisfactory answer. There is to be sure the impossible thrill of reaching the summit planting your flag and taking in the unbeatable view. But getting to that point will require a person to cross rickety bridges over staggering thousand-meter drops navigate treacherous mountain passes with poor visibility maintain their balance when unexpected avalanches strike (which is distressingly often) and deal with an ever-waning oxygen supply. Is the sheer level of danger an enticement for some? Kormakur never sufficiently individuates his characters to answer that question. Hes too busy setting some of them on a course for death to fully tap into the obsession that gives them life. And in a way this proves to be a thoroughly reasonable even refreshing dramatic strategy. This is a movie not about a few human beings who tried to conquer a mountain but rather a mountain that took no notice of the human beings in its midst. Kormakur doesnt make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. ""Everest"" is blunt businesslike and -- as it begins its long march through the death zone -- something of an achievement. The specifics dont get any clearer but editor Mick Audsleys cross-cutting among the different climbing factions creates its own propulsive logic. We get to know the characters not just by their appearances and personalities but by their different positions on the mountain where many of them find themselves trapped as a freak storm sets in. Death seeps into the picture slowly practically on tiptoe. At times it proceeds with an almost merciful swiftness but for most of those who succumb the process is brutally slow and drawn out Their steps get shorter and slower their breaths quickening into futility and eventually the camera plants itself next to them and watches slowly as all blood sensation and feeling drain away. With the exception of one miscalculated sequence involving a sun-dappled hallucination ""Everest"" is strikingly unsentimental; under such cruelly elemental circumstances the usual platitudes about perseverance and love winning the day simply cease to apply. There is only death and survival here and the human spirit it turns out has little to do with any of it. The mountain in question is no stranger to the bigscreen and viewers hoping to see it in all its glory might do well to start with a documentary like the landmark 1998 Imax film ""Everest"" or 2010s ""The Wildest Dream Conquest of Everest."" For all the resources that Kormakur and his crew have expended on persuasively re-creating a Himalayan climb (shot on location in Nepal and the Italian Alps) their ""Everest"" seems more concerned with verisimilitude than visual rapture. Kormakur working in the quick-and-dirty style he demonstrated in his earlier Hollywood outings (""Contraband"" ""2 Guns"") isnt one to linger on even the most staggering images that pass before his camera; while the landscapes do benefit from the eye-popping quality of the 3D the overall aesthetic strategy here might be boiled down to ""Beauty is for wusses."" (There were points at the Imax screening attended in which certain details of Salvatore Totinos generally crisp cinematography looked weirdly indistinct.) The most transporting element of the technical package may be the superior sound design and mix in which the ever-present howl of the wind and the scrape of boots on snow are kept in just the right balance with the characters voices. If the film is weak on characterization the actors provide strong links nonetheless. Clarke typically cast in roles that take advantage of his gift for brutish menace does some of his most appealing work as a patient meticulous and unfailingly loyal team leader. Brolin and Hawkes are superb as two climbers whose abilities arent entirely equal to their ambitions while Sam Worthington provides a sturdy anchor as Halls friend Guy Cotter a seasoned climber who helps try to navigate the climbers to safety from base camp. Moris Yasuko the lone female climber on the Adventure Consultants team stands out as a figure of sweet yet unshakable determination while Watson is heartrending as the teams coordinator and den mother; beyond the mountain Knightley and Robin Wright give deeply felt performances as women haunted by the possibility that they may have seen the last of their husbands. Given that the cast of ""Everest"" includes 11 real-life Sherpas its a shame we dont see more of them in action or learn more about their crucial underappreciated role in helping climbers realize their goals (audiences looking to learn more would do well to seek out Jennifer Peedoms ""Sherpa"" a documentary thats presently making the fall festival rounds). Likewise those hoping for a critically nuanced inquiry into the downsides of Himalayan tourism wont find it beyond the movies fairly unambiguous cautionary tale. David Breashears who co-directed the 1998 doc of the same title wore many hats on the set of Kormakurs film Hes credited here as co-producer second-unit Everest d.p. and yak wrangler and indeed they are nothing if not well wrangled.

Ratul Roy says May 26 2016 at 103 am In the movie the writer and the director did a huge mistake in terms of selecting local musical appearance. They put a hindi song of the movie kabhi khushi kabhi gam which started from the 6th minute of the movie. Though the story of the movie is based on the year 1996 but the song the selected was from that movie which was released in 2001. It might be a minor fault they would say but to many extent it is a huge mistake from the film makers perspective. I really think they should make the necessary correction thereby. Reply mika577 says October 1 2015 at 727 pm I think this subject is much too complicated to be properly explored in the feature film format. As such anyone familiar with the already widely reported events of that day will find the film superficial and unsatisfying. I also question the filmmakers decision to completely whitewash the story of fellow climber Gau Ming-Ho (Makalu) from the film and find it hard not to believe that this decision was based on the fact that he is not a westerner. This kind of cultural imperialism is deeply troubling as anyone viewing the film without being aware of the larger story will not even know that such choices have been made. David Breashears 2008 documentary remains the essential filmic account of the disaster. Reply Rackman 2001 says September 21 2015 at 203 pm It would really be a great idea to read INTO THIN AIR and THE CLIMB before seeing this movie. INTO THIN AIR is amazing THE CLIMB is good but both give so much insight to the conditions and the physical and mental state of the climbers. Krakauer and Boukreev where experienced climbers Boukreev at the time was regarded as one of if not the best climber and had summited Everest on a number of occasions without supplemental oxygen. Reply Peter Millican says October 2 2015 at 1218 am The film appears to be based on two books giving the true causes behind the tragedy Left For Dead and A Day To Die For. The facts touched on by the film had up until recently been kept from the public domain. To truly understand the 96 Everest disaster these two would bring you much nearer to the truth. It is interesting that Into Thin Air is not credited by the film...speaks volumes Reply Ana Assis (anitcha0411_ana) says September 21 2015 at 1033 am This is one of those movies that deserve another movie just to explain how it was shot and produced. I was blown away. Reply Weston DeWalt says September 2 2015 at 535 am Anatoli Boukreevs respect for the mountains he climbed and his dedication to training was what led to his hiring by Scott Fischer of the Mountain Madness expedition. That decision resulted in all of the Mountain Madness client-climbers being able to return home to their family and friends while many of those associated with the Adventure Consultants expedition fared less well. There is ever so much more to be told about the events of 10 May 1996. Perhaps one day the totality of the story will be told.

Daily Edition Login to download Everest Venice Review 230 AM PDT 9/2/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A gripping and immersive dramatization of a tragic trek. TWITTER Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin headline an international cast in Baltasar Kormakurs big-screen account of the disastrous 1996 trek along Mount Everest. For the 99.999 percent of us who will never climb Mount Everest the new 3D Imax drama Everest provides plenty of vividly illustrated reasons to rationalize leaving it off ones bucket list. However there are quite a few good reasons to see this robust dramatization of a 1996 assault on the worlds tallest mountain that went disastrously wrong beginning with the eye-popping you-are-there visual techniques that make you feel glad indeed that youre not actually up there at 29029 feet but also including multiple characters sufficiently humanized to create real concern for their fates and an attention to realistic detail that gives the film texture. Universal should be able to add this one to its impressive list of 2015 box-office successes. This autumn seems to be the season for vertigo-inducing 3D Imax releases what with this and the World Trade Center tightrope-walking drama The Walk in the offing. All the same Everest doesnt go in for cheap shots or sensation for sensations sake remaining close to the men and women who have journeyed to the Himalayas for different reasons but for the same purpose to get to the top of the world. With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals -- some of whom are destined not to make it -- you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term but it doesnt feel like one. And thats a good thing. Telling the same story as but not officially based on Jon Krakauers best-selling book Into Thin Air (perhaps changing things up because the book was already officially adapted for a 1997 TV movie Into Thin Air Death on Everest) the film hinges on the freakish conditions that led to the deaths of eight climbers on May 10 1996. Krakauer is present as a character (played by House of Cards Michael Kelly) there to write an article for Outside magazine. The fact that some engaging friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organizers and guides may account for a good deal of the films immediate accessibility; theyre the competent reassuring type youd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition. Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) a seemingly all-around great guy runs Adventure Consultants and hes helped out most importantly by logistics coordinator Helen (Emily Watson) and guide and close friend Guy (Clarkes fellow ex-Terminator Sam Worthington). Read more Jake Gyllenhaal Signs Production Deal With Bold Films Aside from Krakauer among those arriving from distant places are Beck (Josh Brolin) a big-talking Texan; Doug (John Hawkes) a mailman who failed to make it up on a previous attempt and Yasuko (Naoko Mori) a Japanese woman who has scaled the highest mountains on every other continent. Two competing guides who will be leading groups up on the same day are stark opposites American hippie Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Russian Anatoli Boukreev (Ingvar Sigordsson) a military-style tough guy so macho that he refuses to use supplementary oxygen. The starting off point for summit seekers is Katmandu and Everest earns early points for its unblinking glimpses of the Nepalese capitals almost grotesque squalor a characteristic that now spills over to the sites of the ascent base camps where no one gives a thought to cleaning up. Krakauer had initially thought to focus his Outside piece on the downsides of Everest tourism and to its credit the film doesnt shy away from highlighting the unseemly effects of overcrowding not only at the camps but on the path to the summit. Based on weather forecasts all the tour guides have decided to make the final ascent on the same day and theres no one to arbitrate or tell someone they cant go whenever they want. Cooperation is useful up to a point but once you get up to Hillarys Step the final 40-foot wall approachable only by a narrow passage where one slowpoke can cause a major logjam overcrowding becomes an issue at a location where until 43 years earlier no one on Earth had ever set foot. But the very fact that climbing Everest had become by this time if not simple at least somewhat commonplace is part of what led to the disaster that has been effectively condensed into such a dramatic but not melodramatic screenplay by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. Theres a lulling sense of certainty that everything will be okay a feeling reinforced by the patient ever-helpful Aussie personnel. Its key that Clarke is so thoroughly likeable as Rob Hall; as soon as you meet the guy you feel youre in good hands a sense reinforced by Worthingtons and Watsons characters. Read more Critics Notebook Fall Fest Lineups Stoke Fear of Weak Awards Season In a way that is engagingly welcoming rather than just informational the film provides a snappy account of the 40-day prep period; the groups proceed to ever-higher elevations to acclimatize to the altitude camaradaries develop foibles and fears are exposed and anxieties and anticipation mix in equal measure. Becks Texas braggadocio becomes kind of a gag masking real vulnerabilities (its also startling to learn hes paid 65000 to make the climb and this was nearly 20 years ago) while Doug refuses to let some alarming physical symptoms deter him from his quest. For his part Rob is distracted by the pregnancy of his wife (Keira Knightley) back home; reasonably reliable if expensive phone connections facilitate cutaways to her as well as to Becks wife (Robin Wright). This is the hokiest stuff in the film. The second hour is devoted to the final ascent and its aftermath and its all quite intense. A perfect entirely unexpected storm howls in as the first climbers arrive on the tiny precipice while many more are lined up single file on the narrow path waiting their turns. While its sometimes impossible to identify whos who under all the coasts hoods goggles and masks director Baltasar Kormakur does a very good job given the gusts of whooshing wind and blinding snow of keeping the action coherent and involving; the consequences of over-exposure to the elements are made plainly and painfully evident. It is in the end as sad and tragic a film as the story warrants. For the past several years Kormakur has juggled projects in his native Iceland with mid-range Mark Wahlberg-starring Hollywood action fare. His last homemade feature The Deep in 2012 was also a true-life death-or-survival tale but Everest bigger and more complex than anything hes done before vaults him into a new spot professionally. The cast is rock-solid and the only thing one might have wished for is the foregrounding of one or two of the sherpa guides who are around but not much integrated into the main action. Some filming was done in Nepal with further mountain location work based in Italy and studio scenes shot in Rome and London.
