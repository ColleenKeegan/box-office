You could say shes played the ruthless manipulator already - in Election devastating the decent on her upward climb with perfectly judged lethal seductiveness. Now here she is in full regency fig with a Whos Who of the British acting profession and the result is long-winded blunt and flat. Whats gone wrong? It may be the reallocation of the screenplay from Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet (whose long labour of love the project was) to the marketable Julian Fellowes best known for his cloth-eared sense of period in Gosford Park where he made Ivor Novello sing (the real Novello notoriously couldnt and wouldnt even in his own musicals). It may be director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) taking revenge for decades of Western misrepresentation of the subcontinent - Thackerays (and come to that Brighton Pavilions) Indian references get wildly out of proportion and a nautch-girl routine for the Prince Regent is grotesquely out of style. Hollywood plus Bollywood influences dont leave much room for any sense of British society discovering greed is good while paying lip service to conventional morality against the seismic political upheavals of the Napoleonic wars. An opportunity lost.Witherspoon is basically too nice as Becky as if frightened of losing our sympathy and a host of sterling players (Jim Broadbent Bob Hoskins Geraldine McEwan) exude a sense of occasion longing for better roles to get their teeth into. By no means unintelligent it looks good; but the impression remains that its all dressed up with nowhere to go.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

In an engaging propulsive performance as the strong-willed social-climbing English governess who aspires to enter high society by any means Witherspoon moves director Mira Nairs version of Thackerays social satire forward at a good clip making Beckys rising and falling fortunes an intensely watchable spectator sport. Unfortunately Nairs film doesnt so much end as fall off a cliff the ultimate victim of viewers heightened expectations that this briskly paced story will take them someplace -- other than around the block in a horse-drawn carriage. Becky (Reese Witherspoon) climbs her way to the top of the social ladder with husband Rawdon (James Purefoy) in ""Vanity Fair."" (Frank Connor -- Focus Features) _____More in Movies_____  Vanity Fair Details  Watch the Trailer  Feature Mira Nairs Vanity Project  All Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  Todays Headlines amp; Columnists See a Sample  |  Sign Up Now  Breaking News Alerts See a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Set in the early years of the 19th century when the rungs of English society were even more sharply defined by class (on the upper echelons of which Thackeray cast his jaundiced gaze) ""Vanity Fair"" is not the kind of story with a conventional hero and Beckys behavior which might charitably be called expedient is far from something to root for. Still Witherspoon cant help making her heroine far more likable than Thackerays ever was. Which means that when all is said and done we want more for her than she ever deserves or gets. Trading on her beauty cleverness and what one character calls her ""talent for life"" Becky rises from near poverty to comfortable -- if borrowed -- wealth over the course of the film thanks to such benefactors as a smarmy nobleman named appropriately enough Steyne (pronounced ""stain""). Played by Gabriel Byrne with a jaded half-smirk Steyne is on the one hand a kind of villain seeing as he ultimately demands something unseemly from Becky for all his social introductions and unsolicited financial assistance. And it is Steyne after all who arranges for the military posting that puts Beckys handsome if rakish husband Rawdon (James Purefoy) in harms way after Rawdon walks in on Steyne attempting to collect his due. Yet Steyne is also a stand-in of sorts for Thackeray. An observer of hypocrisies who is both of and above the world he criticizes he mocks the upper crust even as he partakes of its nourishment. If Steyne is the bad guy however Becky isnt quite the good girl we -- or Nair and Witherspoon -- might like her to be. For one thing shes an indifferent mother and her palpable pain when her son is taken away from her late in the film is tempered by our memory of how little she seemed to care for him when for example he was taking his first steps. Thanks to Witherspoon we may find ourselves wanting Becky (a true survivor) to make it at the same time that we feel disapproval for the ways in which she does and the toll those ways take on our esteem for her. Where ""Vanity Fair"" succeeds is in its indelible depiction of the lively central character who makes us both care for her and disapprove of her flawed moral outlook. Yet this is also the movies failing. Shouldnt a character this appealing and this smart be able to learn the error of her ways over the course of her journey? That she doesnt isnt really Thackerays fault so much as Witherspoons. She is in a way too good. After all the author doesnt care all that much for Becky except as a literary device with which to make his sharp points about the haves the have-nots and the wanna-haves. The actress however has gone to such lengths to breathe life spirit and soul into Becky that it only seems reasonable for the audience to hope for a redemption for the character that never comes.

Ever since William Makepeace Thackeray created her more than 150 years ago she has been the universally recognized embodiment of the social climber in her case trying to rise out of poverty to a respectable position in a society -- Georgian England -- more rigidly stratified than any we know. In that delicately poised world speaking the wrong word using the wrong fork could mean disaster and the suspense in Vanity Fair derives largely from our anxious observation of Becky navigating a vast sea of swells. We have to like Becky and thanks to Reese Witherspoons perky performance we do not least because we have all been in her position desperate to impress our betters. Moreover director Mira Nair has created a pretty panorama -- populated with solid actors like Bob Hoskins and Gabriel Byrne -- of English life in the Georgian era for Becky to master. It is more exotic than Thackerays more laden with the booty of a burgeoning colonial empire but Nair Indian by birth is entitled to her opinions about the exploitations on which Englands wealth was based. Yet theres something about her Vanity Fair that doesnt quite work. There is no depth beneath its bright surfaces no potent emotional undercurrents. One thinks of Stanley Kubricks Barry Lyndon also based on a Thackeray novel about an ill-born social outsider on the rise. It too was a beautiful film but it did not merely record a lost world; it peered at it -- as if the fold of a dress or the knot of a cravat might possibly contain the secret of life. Or at least a useful clue to correct behavior. Then too it was touched by an ineffable sadness. Its vanities were all in vain. Thackeray said he was writing about pompous self-satisfied people trying to live without God or humility. It makes no difference if you see their furious scurryings existentially or traditionally. You must impute some larger resonance to them. Otherwise you are left with only a twittering among the teacups -- or a vanity fair.

"Vanity Fairs dull Becky Sharp. Slate Sign In Sign Up Vanity Fairs dull Becky Sharp. Vanity Fairs dull Becky Sharp. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 2 2004 725 PM Alls Foul In Vanity Fair The conniving Becky Sharp becomes a dull martyred mope. By David Edelstein Not so flippin Sharp after all Its always touching when liberal antiracist feminist artists take it upon themselves to rescue incorrect classics from the prejudices of the authors age. Nutty but touching. I remember seeing a nonsensical production of The Merchant of Venice in which Shylock was the one honorable man amid some horribly decadent anti-Semitic Venetians (they acted more like Venusians) and one of King Lear in which Regan and Goneril were two good daughters doing their best with a patriarchal monster of a father. (Dumb as that sounds Peter Brook made something compelling of the concept and in A Thousand Acres Jane Smiley recast Lear along similar lines to surprising effect.) But I never thought Id see a Becky Sharp the near-demonic schemer of William Thackerays Vanity Fair turned into a martyred ingenue--a gifted young woman driven to overcome the arbitrary restrictions of a sexist and fiercely class-driven society. What a fascinating topsy-turvy idea. But the resulting Vanity Fair (Focus Features)--directed by Mira Nair and starring Reese Witherspoon as a Becky far more sinned against than sinning--makes absolutely no sense. If you see this downbeat movie without having waded through Thackerays interminable but often archly amusing dissection of the English upper class at the dawn of the 19th century youd have no notion that Becky Sharp is one of the great comic female characters in literature--a woman whose take on the society that has shunned her is too deeply cynical to allow for trust or love who is attractive for her boldness yet repugnant for the way in which she uses people without conscience. A gifted improviser shes able to keep her emotions in check and generate tears on cue (only servants and children--especially her own son--see her true nastiness); and when a kind of decency peeks through--as in her affection for her guileless friend Amelia Sedley--its a rare event. But in the rethinking of Nair (and her hapless screenwriters) that decency is the rule rather than the exception. And so were left with an increasingly weak-willed protagonist and a narrative with no driving force--no motor. Advertisement After Election and even Legally Blonde Witherspoon seemed like ideal casting that big sharp--Becky Sharp--jaw line; that crack comic timing; that laserlike stare. But her Becky is a complete dud. In the late stages of pregnancy when the movie was shot she has been costumed to conceal her body; she moves tentatively; and her twittery voice sounds flat and inexpressive beside the great English stage actors who round out the cast. Always taking an extra beat to weigh the pros and cons of her actions (the brow furrows the eyes move back and forth the jaw sets) she emerges a mostly passive little thing preyed upon by assorted rich men and unjustly accused of being a conniver. A conniver The average contemporary-soap heroine has more commanding wiles. Witherspoon cant even bring off the scenes in which her singing is supposed to melt the resistance of her fiercest drawing-room adversaries They seem to be listening to her reedy soprano out of pity. So while Vanity Fair is extremely faithful to the novels incidents and dialogue its meaning has been altered by 180 degrees. Characters who on the page are wise to regard her as poison on the screen become the unthinking instruments of societys repression. As Nair demonstrated in Monsoon Wedding she has an eye for primary colors and swirly spectacle and in Vanity Fair she composes frames in which youre distinctly aware of the menials serving at the pleasure of their ""betters"" but refrains from ramming that caste system down your throat. However Nairs simple-minded take on Beckys trajectory kills all the drama. After a lively opening 45 minutes the narrative grows more and more perplexing. Perhaps the worst-directed acted and written scene of the year is the one in which Jonathan Rhys-Myers as Beckys best friends husband George Osborne puts the moves on Becky at a dance before Napoleon invades Belgium. Hes callow and effeminate shes sexless and the exchange comes out of nowhere The adapters have cut all the stuff in which Becky has flirted outrageously with him. At that moment Vanity Fair disintegrates--and never fully reassembles itself. Mores the pity because well probably never see better casting in the supporting roles--almost all of them. Rhys Ifans is mysteriously reluctant to make Dobbin the klutz he is in the novel but James Purefoy is every inch the decent but lazily rakish Rawdon Crawley and Romola Garai makes an outrageously pretty Amelia. (Is she too pretty? Maybe but in the movie Amelia has acquired more stature as Becky has plummeted.) Jim Broadbent is vivid as Osborne Sr. a father unnaturally warped by the desire to buy his family a title; and Bob Hoskins as the slovenly aristocrat Pitt the Elder delivers an unprecedentedly nuanced portrait of dissolution. Eileen Atkins and Gabriel Byrne steal the first and second halves of the film respectively. She plays the rich spinster Matilda Crawley with regal impudence and the screenwriters do full justice to Matilda--a woman who loves a good romance-novel elopement but cant abide such a thing in her own life. And Byrne is a magnetic Marquess of Steyne a dark lord whos more dangerous as a friend than as an enemy A scene in which he cruelly taunts his wife daughter and daughter-in-law is the films most chilling (and Thackeray-esque). Its too bad that in the scheme of this movie Steyne is no longer a monstrous co-conspirator but a leering Count Dracula who exploits our poor innocent Becky. I wonder if anything could have made this misfire work. Maybe Nair could have hired Charlie Kaufman to make Thackeray himself a character--the biographer of Becky who will do her the final injustice of misinterpreting her motives? No Thackeray gave us an antiheroine who has endured in the collective imagination for 150 years. The dull feminist victim of Mira Nair and Reese Witherspoon wont linger in the mind past Labor Day.

At the far end of the room concealed in shadow behind a bit of tattered curtain lurks the sinisterly leering Mrs. Crawley herself dagger (or is that a scarf?) in hand. Thackerays caption reads ""Beckys second appearance in the character of Clytemnestra."" No such Becky Sharp and no such inkling of malicious intent appear in Mira Nairs turgid melodramatic travesty of Thackerays gimlet-eyed satire. Nor does the pretentious silliness of the party charades that occasioned that ruthless climbers first appearance as Clytemnestra; they have been replaced by a wholly anachronistic Bollywood kootch dance. And when Rhys Ifans Colonel Dobbin describes Becky as having about as much feeling for her child -- and by extension anyone else -- as ""a cat does for its litter"" again we have been introduced to no such character. On the contrary we have just watched this supposedly indifferent parent tearfully press her fingers to the glass of the carriage that is to cart a fragile Rawdon Jr. off to boarding school. Whence the transformation -- from satire to melodrama from ""novel without a hero"" to portrait of a bighearted if vaguely disreputable lady? Perhaps more urgently how does a stroke of casting genius -- Reese Witherspoon as Becky Sharp a matchup not so much inspired as pre-ordained since she played a teenage Becky in Alexander Paynes Election -- end up conveying so little of whats at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair?

Sep. 13 600pm It certainly may have something to do with Witherspoons own vanity with an Oscar-less young stars need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the ""real"" Becky Sharp. It absolutely does have something to do with Witherspoon laboring under the same generic if fine-tuned English accent that has at one time or another afflicted the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. (Meanwhile Natasha Little the British actress who played Becky so credibly in the excellent 1998 BBC miniseries is here consigned to a thankless supporting role.) Yet the deeper problems with this Vanity Fair lie with the extent to which Nair and her screenwriters (among them Gosford Parks Julian Fellowes) were at liberty to turn Thackerays black-comic panorama of London society -- of ""people living without God in the world . . . greedy pompous mean self-satisfied"" -- into a mere backdrop to the instructive saga of one sympathetic and resourceful young womans spirited if doomed rebellion against hypocrisy and social caste. (From the relentlessly P.C. director of Mississippi Masala and Monsoon Wedding this was predictable.) Wiser producers might have insisted that Nair import (as Kubrick did for Barry Lyndon) a clarifying dose of the authors one-wit-skewers-all narration. Nair apparently found it antithetical to her purpose.   Setting aside the question of fidelity to its source -- no mean feat when it comes to assessing an expensive literary adaptation -- what of those who havent had the pleasure of a prior acquaintance who arrive at the theater primed for a lively two-plus hours of fancy-dress wit and scandal another helping of Pride and Prejudice or Nicholas Nickleby? If one makes further allowances for a saccharine score leaden direction murky lighting and the waste of Bob Hoskins (as the seedy Baronet Pitt Crawley) this Vanity Fair is not without its pleasures. The set pieces and costumes are sumptuous if overbearing. Eileen Atkins (as the wealthy spinster Matilda Crawley) Gabriel Byrne (as the corrupt Marquess of Steyne) and James Purefoy (as Rawdon Sr.) bring any number of scenes -- and happily Ms. Witherspoon -- to unexpected life as do the many Indian or India-tinted scenes intended presumably to enlist Thackeray in the service of a backward-looking anti-colonial agenda but nonetheless full of color and zest. Still even those who havent read Vanity Fair may find themselves questioning Becky Sharps right to an ending as happy as the one provided for her by Nair amp; Co. -- and wondering what the devil is she doing on the back of that elephant?

Well Becky Sharp climbs for the same reason Sammy Glick ran and all those other strivers strived and hustlers hustled Need. Hunger. Anger. And most of all the furious desire to be somebody. But the larger point is that as she climbs she penetrates and as she penetrates she illuminates and in the end her creator William Makepeace Thackeray has exposed a whole society. The novel of course is ""Vanity Fair"" an example of 19th century genius at its finest one of those big fat sprawly books with a thousand characters and a battle a ball lots of parties and celebrations usually a duel or two and sometimes a deathbed declaration and at least 17500 semicolons. Too bad they dont write them anymore. But heres Mira Nairs fine movie version of the 1848 book in all its glory and scope and wit. _____More in Movies_____  Vanity Fair Details  Watch the Trailer  Feature Mira Nairs Vanity Project  All Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert It goes everywhere it sees everything in Regency England and at the center of it all is bold brash opportunistic and yet wonderfully gifted Becky Sharp. Youd think that such a creature would be a natural in movies and yet on the big screen only Myrna Loy (in 1932) and Miriam Hopkins (in 1935) had played her and neither the movies nor the performances are much remembered. What a pity. Was there ever a role better made for the young Bette Davis? In the 40s tough little Barbara Stanwyck would have been perfect. After the war the movies flattened out the women made them softer and bustier and more neurotic and the possibility of a zingy ""Vanity Fair"" vanished. Thus its no surprise that the role of Becky in post-feminist 2004 goes to the one modern actress with a classic 30s face and zest the American Reese Witherspoon who makes a far far better Englishwoman than Renee Zellweger did in ""Bridget Joness Diary."" Witherspoons simply terrific and its amazing how quickly and easily she sheds speculation that she was too modern for the role. Somehow Witherspoon makes Becky likable as well as admirable. You sense this young woman born in poverty in the slums understands the hypocrisies of her age more acutely than do those who are a part of its system and you respect the way she plays its vanities off against each other to engineer yet more prosperous relationships until at last she comes to be the favorite of the Marquess of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne). Witherspoon is perky but never simply perky; you see a wicked gleam in her eye and a sense that she enjoys the game of climbing even when it deposits her ever so briefly at the shabby estate of a country squire noted for both his stupidity and his greed. But thats all right hes not very clean either. The plot is set up neatly by Thackeray to parallel the rise and fall of two young women the good Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai) and the bad Becky Sharp. But of course we like Becky far better because shes active dynamic and ambitious while poor Amelia is long-suffering and sanctimonious and a perpetual victim frequently of herself. Is there anything duller than a good girl? One of the clever tricks the movie plays is a gambit at movies end when Becky saves Amelia from Amelias worst enemy Amelia. In any event Becky the daughter of a starving artist and a somewhat dubious French woman (stories conflict) grows up a poor orphan in a Miss Pinkhams posh finishing school where she learns the ways of the aristocracy under the stern mandate that she can never be one. But that doesnt stop her. She sets out to win her way on charm and guile and up and up she goes. The trip takes her primarily into the tribe of men for it is men who control society while the women only remark upon it. Beckys love life -- or since actual sex probably never occurs her network of ties and flirtations and respites of favor and deserts of disfavor -- are immensely complicated. Briefly when shes visiting friend Amelia she meets Amelias betrothed sexy George (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who is quickly smitten with her wit and beauty a disturbing development. Meanwhile poor Amelia is being earnestly wooed by the noble worship of clumsy Captain Dobbin (Rhys Ifans). Then Becky steals the heart of another officer Rawdon Crawley (handsome James Purefoy) who happens to be the favorite nephew of her new employer the wealthy Miss Matilda Crawley (Eileen Atkins delicious as the tart-tongued old biddy). When Rawdon marries Becky the two are cast out and disinherited by Miss Matilda. Along comes Napoleon that nasty man who escapes from Elba and heads for his Waterloo at a place called er Waterloo where all the men fight after a fancy ball at which all the women and all the plots counterplots intrigues heaving bosoms golden ringlets thigh-high cavalry boots (really cool by the way) are present. Some survive the epic fight some dont; Nair re-creates it in a tableau of the fallen in just a few seconds. Its reminiscent of that scene in ""Gone With the Wind"" when Victor Flemings camera cranes backward farther and farther and the shot gets wider and wider until the whole world seems filled with the dead and the dying. Its one of Nairs frequently brilliant images that sums up incisively a moment or an event. After the war with Regency decadence in full blossom and debauched George IV on the throne (so much fun before dour grim Queen Vicky doused it all in a cold shower of rectitude) Becky catches the attention of Steyne a bounder and cad himself as it becomes evident that poor Rawley just isnt going to make it in civilian life (hes a gambler). You have to give it to Becky She seems to become what might be called a professional mentee less than a mistress yet more than an assistant. Its a delicate transaction but negotiating it is her genius Shes always got a mentor a believer in her who sponsors her until she trades up. Shes always the outsider on the make; love seems only a distraction something for the well-born. Which itself brings us to another curious issue. This is totally an outsiders view of a decade of English history. Nair is an outsider herself even more so than the climber Becky Sharp and the American Reese Witherspoon. Shes Indian by birth and has always been fascinated by the interface of cultures. Her first non-documentary film was the widely praised ""Salaam Bombay"" and her best film was probably ""Mississippi Masala"" which watched a young Indian woman and an African American have an affair in the modern American South. She has a profound sense of her own culture even as she so effortlessly evokes Western culture. This gives her ""Vanity Fair"" an unusual spice -- you might even call it a curry. Her vision of English society in the early 19th century is positively alight with the flavors of India. Theres very much a sense in this picture of the omnipotence the power of the abiding Eastern culture over the usurping Western one. In some sense India is the mother-healer of the British empire as ever so frequently people go there for a sort of spiritual repair or healing. This dichotomy is particularly expressed in the cinematography (by Declan Quinn) India is hot and bright and lush and vivid while old blighty is greenish and wet and dank. Without a word being spoken you feel the directors preference in the photography. Thats an irony that runs all the way through Nairs vision of ""Vanity Fair""; the original book was set at the high-water mark of empire in the British century when Britannia ruled the waves pip pip what ho and all that jolly old fun; yet in this movie makes the point that even as England was capturing its empire the empire was capturing England. Vanity Fair (137 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo and battle violence.

Unlikely concoction Reese Witherspoons Becky Sharp is a spunky version of the novels venomous vixen. Focus Features Director Mira Nair has taken generous license with the story. A lot of the nuance subtlety and intricacy of the classic novel is lost in trying to whittle it down to a two-hour format. But to be fair Thackeray is not easy to adapt to the screen though Stanley Kubrick managed it beautifully with 1975s Barry Lyndon. Vanity Fair leaps disjointedly over a couple of decades introduces characters without developing them sufficiently neglects to age them visually and bogs down under the weight of the interwoven story lines. But its biggest flaw lies in failing to capture the novels sharply satiric and ironic tone. (Related video Watch the Vanity Fair trailer) Reese Witherspoon plays Becky Sharp the orphaned daughter of an English artist and a French chorus girl. Making the most of her British education she sets out to find fortune if not fame. It is the early 19th century and Becky is not content to merely climb the social ladder; she wants to race to the top skipping rungs en route. Though Witherspoon does an adequate job of playing a cagey and clever coquette she possesses a wholesomeness that doesnt allow her to fully capture the more vicious qualities of Thackerays character. Its as if Beckys immoral siren has been sanitized for the preteen fans of Legally Blonde a scheming Becky Sharp leavened by the cheerful pluck of the ditzy-yet-brainy Elle Woods. At times she nearly comes off as a feminist heroine rather than the pathological and promiscuous social climber she was in the novel. Though Witherspoon showed she could play unlikable characters convincingly in Election portraying a vain vixen in this multilayered period piece proves a challenge. Thackerays book is a commentary on British imperialism social order and aristocracy but much of that is lost in the film which deals with these themes in only broad and predictable ways. Fortunately some of Thackerays sharp wit has made its way into the screenplay in lines such as one characters assessment of Becky ""I had thought she was a mere social climber but I see now I was wrong Shes a mountaineer."" Nair adds lively elements of her native Indian culture. Thackeray was born in Calcutta and some of his characters spend time in India so the creative license Nair takes makes some narrative sense. But a musical number with contemporary-sounding Indian music and belly dancing feels jarring more Bollywood than Victorian Britain. Thackeray said that he wanted ""to leave everybody dissatisfied and unhappy at the end of the story."" Nair may have had other intentions but by films end audiences are bound to be left dissatisfied with the choppy and confusing storytelling style and unhappy about the missed opportunity.

A pale slender creature with alluringly downcast eyes the orphaned Becky emerges at age 19 from Miss Pinkertons academy for young ladies -- where she worked for her keep -- into early 19th-century England ready to use her smile and her wits to ascend to the upper classes by whatever means necessary. She is in other words a player and ""Vanity Fair"" -- both the Thackeray novel and the Mira Nair movie opening today -- is a play in the very best sense of the world. The book written several decades after the period in which it is set is a gloriously clattering pageant a tale spun by an all-knowing opinionated narrator who calls himself Manager of the Performance and populated by a bevy of flawed but irresistible characters. Its 800-plus pages crammed with description reflection and enough plot to sink a less skillfully steered ship present a daunting challenge for feature-film adaptation. And indeed nobodys tried it since the 1930s (though there have been several television miniseries based on the novel which have the luxury of more screen time). Perhaps it was just waiting for Mira Nair the India-born (like Thackeray) filmmaker known for the colorful swirl of her films such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Kama Sutra."" Along with screenwriter Julian Fellowes an Oscar-winner for ""Gosford Park"" (who did a rewrite on the original screenplay by Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet) shes created a pared-down but wonderfully cluttered rendition of Thackerays work beautifully acted by a dream troupe of performers. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Vanity Fair"" with Reese Witherspoon Eileen Atkins Jim Broadbent Gabriel Byrne Romola Garai Bob Hoskins Rhys Ifans Geraldine McEwan James Purefoy Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Directed by Mira Nair from a screenplay by Matthew Faulk Mark Skeet and Julian Fellowes based on the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sensuality/partial nudity and a brief violent image. Several theaters. Reese Witherspoon the lone American in the cast struggles a bit with her accent but is otherwise delightful as Becky -- with her determined chin and never-miss-a-thing gaze shes got just the right sort of angelic naughtiness. (Even her teeth look sharp.) Though Becky is an actress Witherspoons performance never feels actressy; shes found a tiny core of vulnerability in her anti-hero heroine and built a fortress around it. ""I could be good for five thousand a year"" says Becky in a dazzling blue gown and she almost believes it. Romola Garai as Beckys hopelessly sweet friend Amelia is winsomeness personified; with her slight lisp and adorably goofball air shes like a British Joan Cusack. The casts young men (James Purefoy as Rawdon Crawley; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as George Osborne) are perhaps a bit contemporary in their look and delivery but are nonetheless dashing. And the supporting cast is packed with splendid turns. Eileen Atkins as shrewish spinster Matilda Crawley displays an uncanny gift for freezing in horror (""A tradesmans son?""). Jim Broadbent as Georges father bracingly blusters. Nair fills the screen with color and richness; with peacocks strolling across the lawns alongside the vibrantly costumed cast. (At an elegant party late in the film the ladies resemble those very birds with their long elegant necks and elaborate plumage.) And while a Bollywood dance number performed by Becky in the films final act feels a bit out of place the films charm has already taken hold; by this point were Beckys (and Nairs) willing admirers ready to go along with whatever she wants. Make no mistake; ""Vanity Fair"" the movie takes many liberties with ""Vanity Fair"" the book as indeed it must. But the sense of Beckys long man-by-man climb up the ladder of ambition -- and the narratives ultimate ambivalence toward the journey -- shines as brightly as the jewels she finally wears. Theres a lovely moment early in the film not from the book that sold it for me sad-eyed Becky still a child (played by Angelica Mandy) arrives unhappily at Miss Pinkertons school. She wanders away from the adults and finds herself in a large empty room -- perhaps a ballroom perhaps a place where dreams someday might come true. She wanders in the room lost in possibility. The journey begins and were on it with her.

Focus Features Photo Reese Witherspoon plays Becky Sharp in Mira Nairs adaptation of William Makepeace Thackerays ""Vanity Fair."" Focus Features Photo Witherspoon makes a strong sly Becky Sharp in Nairs upbeat feisty take on Vanity Fair 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Vanity Fair Comedy-drama. Starring Reese Witherspoon James Purefoy Romola Garai and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Directed by Mira Nair. (PG-13. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Vanity Fair"" is a conscientious adaptation of the William Makepeace Thackeray novel. A lot of things happen all of it fairly absorbing some of it rendered vividly. Theres a nice languorous economy about the movie -- scenes have time to breathe and environments are inhabited even as the story never flags. Yet somethings missing in director Mira Nairs treatment -- specifically a point of view about the material a compelling reason for this historical excavation beyond the fact that Reese Witherspoon makes a convincing Becky Sharp. She certainly does that. With Witherspoon in the role we understand without requiring any explanation that ""Vanity Fair"" is an essentially upbeat story even though its about a 19th century orphaned girl forced to live by her wits in a culture that would just as soon toss her into the gutter. Witherspoons feistiness intelligence and resiliency allow us from the beginning to put our money on Becky. Witherspoon is in many ways like Miriam Hopkins who starred in the 1935 ""Becky Sharp"" a ""Vanity Fair"" adaptation remembered today only for being one of the first color features. Like Hopkins Witherspoon is American and Southern little smart and loquacious with a smile thats engaging without being entirely reassuring. What she lacks is the edge of malice Hopkins brought to the role the anger under the high spirits that served Hopkins particularly well in the first scene in which Becky is released from a girls school that has exploited her for years. In the new ""Vanity Fair"" that scene is a pale shadow. But Witherspoon has her own approach to the part and it wears well. Her Becky is not just shrewd and hungry. She has also an instinct for life a quality that encompasses a gift for survival but is bigger than merely that. Witherspoons Becky has the gifts of extra confidence extra energy extra strength extra drive extra instinct. She operates on a level that others cant touch and sometimes she gives the impression that instead of rolling over other people shed really rather share her gifts and have some company in these higher reaches of human function. The movie is the tale of Beckys adventures an episodic saga that covers a couple of decades and includes many opportunities and reversals. In sentimental novels 19th century heroines want love security and a decent husband. Becky wants what heroes want money success and glory. She has no specific talent just a lot of personality and a sense of mission. She gets her first foothold in the home of a childhood friend Amelia (Romola Garai) and soon meets the people shell be dealing with over the years. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers gets one of his patented roles as Georgie Amelias fiance the posturing son of a rich merchant. No one can play rich scowling snobs as well as Rhys-Meyers who has a talent for making audiences hate him and yet feel for him at the same time. He suggests a vulnerability within Georgie whose aristocratic ambitions have all to do with wanting to escape the shadow of a cruel greedy father (Jim Broadbent). Beckys trajectory allows her to witness the upper reaches of London society from the merchant class all the way to the king. Along the way she meets Pitt the Elder a slovenly fellow with an estate in disrepair (lustily played by Bob Hoskins). On the other end of the spectrum she gets to know the icy Lord Steyne whose salon is at the center of London society. Its Gabriel Byrne as Steyne who gets off one of the films best lines. He turns on a member of his family and yells ""Theres no one in this household who doesnt wish you dead."" A good all-purpose putdown. Besides Witherspoon the strongest impression is made by James Purefoy as Rawdon Crawley a manly and sincere soldier who in peacetime is just as manly and sincere but rather useless a gambler whos not all that lucky. But then hes lucky in love. Crawleys leave-taking of Becky before the battle of Waterloo is the films single most heartfelt moment by far the one place where the movie becomes more than clever and goes to a more human place. ""Vanity Fair"" is inevitably a feminist tale because Becky will not be kept down. But theres another way of looking at the story which doesnt preclude the feminist treatment and which seems potentially richer. Thats to acknowledge the storys dark side its inescapable revelation that in 19th century England a woman had to be a genius to achieve success -- or even to fight life to a draw. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and scenes of battle.

(CNN) -- William Makepeace Thackerays classic 19th-century serialized story ""Vanity Fair"" ends with the words ""Ah vanitas vanitatum (vanity of vanities) Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? Or having it is satisfied?""To put that in todays much blunter vernacular ""Be careful what you wish for baby because you just may get it."" That is the story of Becky Sharp the heroine of ""Vanity Fair.""Reese Witherspoon 28 and the mother of two is all grown up and making a serious bid for a best actress nomination with this role. She turns in a mature and engaging performance as Becky Sharp -- despite the disturbing fact that while her character supposedly ages from her mid-teens into her mid-thirties her appearance barely changes. Beckys hairstyles change and her cleavage increases but overall not much suggests physical aging. But the character does age emotionally thanks to Witherspoons carefully layered performance.Becky is a surprisingly modern --and stunningly ruthless -- character. Witherspoon who packs a lot of punch in her 5-foot-2-inch frame manages to provoke sympathy even as she leaves a wake of ruin. She climbs from the lowly position of the daughter of a starving artist and a French chorus girl to the peak of Londons high society during the first quarter of the 19th century only to fall -- and fail -- in a spectacular flameout of public scandal.Beckys success is all the more impressive given the long-standing and rigid class structures of the time. Yet when it comes right down to it she did it all the old-fashioned way -- sleeping her way to the top.The film is directed by Mira Nair a native of India and former documentary filmmaker who is best known for her highly praised independent film ""Monsoon Wedding"" (2001).Its interesting to note that the author of ""Vanity Fair"" was born in Calcutta in 1811 and was sent to England at the age of six. Both Nair (who left India to study at Harvard University) and Thackeray have a keen eye for finding and portraying the sharp cultural and socially satirical edges of everyday life.The films authenticity sweeps viewers away into another time and place particularly in the London scenes and at the battle of Waterloo. The audience can almost taste the dirt and grime sweat and smells of 19th-century London making it evident that regardless of station -- whether beggar or king -- harsh conditions were a fact of life.The attention to detail and the eye for color and textures by production designer Maria Djurkovic (""The Hours"" and ""Billy Elliot"") and costume designer Beatrix Aruna Pasztor (""The Fisher King"" and ""Music Box"") are remarkable.All the supporting players are excellent including but not limited to Bob Hoskins Gabriel Byrne Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Romola Garai.The movie is adapted by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes(""Gosford Park"") along with Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet who also serve as associate producers on the film. Adapting this 809-page novel to the screen was no mean feat but the main plot points and story structure have remained intact.The result is a highly satisfying period-style soap opera with heaving bosoms elaborate hairdos and a sweeping look at history.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

The joke of course is that there is nothing at all polite about Thackerays portrait of a woman aboil with vices among them greed avarice and heartless opportunism. Her kind of grasping self-advancement played out against the authors big canvas of class warfare in England during the time of the Napoleonic wars cant simply be explained away by the circumstances of Beckys impoverished roots or the limitations then regularly imposed on her sex. The dismaying switcheroo in director Mira Nairs adaptation with a final script by ""Gosford Park""s Julian Fellowes that Botoxes Thackerays riotous unruly masterpiece is that this ""Vanity Fair"" is indeed genteel and inoffensive. In fact it borders on perky - a duller safer tonal choice for the story of a conniving go-getter whose fall is as precipitous as her rise. Nair the multicultural conjurer of ""Mississippi Masala"" and ""Monsoon Wedding"" may dress her film in the vibrant jewel-toned colors of her native India and indeed spice up the proceedings with a dusting of Bollywood production values. But this ""Vanity Fair"" remains sedately pastel turning demurely away from an explanation of Beckys behavior as anything other than a spirited expression of female empowerment. Girl power my slippered foot In fact the prevailing tone is pink - the kind of pink that Reese Witherspoon who plays Rebecca Sharp made her trademark color as Elle Woods in ""Legally Blonde."" Its impossible to know whether the elfin Witherspoon - with her hard chin and soft grin her Sally Field gumption and Mary Tyler Moore spunk - chose this interpretation after considered literary study or whether after her star-making turn as ambitious Tracy Flick in ""Election"" she bumped up against the ceiling of her abilities to play a more formidable woman. Perhaps Nair let her actress (who was evidently pregnant and pregnanter during production despite the efforts of costumers) enjoy herself while the director devoted her energies to creating the handsome East-meets-West colonizer-meets-colonies visual stews that have become her trademark. Just because theres no earthly Thackerayan reason to include a dreamy upbeat Indian travelogue as a coda for Becky doesnt mean the scene isnt very pretty and suitable for a photo spread in that other Vanity Fair the one that sits on coffee tables. And the dance sequence Witherspoon performs with undulating dancers dressed like pretend slave girls at an Eastern-themed gentlemens club is as fetching as it is nutty. But whatever the reason something essential is lost defeated in this production; theres visual luster but theres no real lust. And the dampness becomes contagious particularly among the younger players. Beckys good-hearted friend Amelia Sedley (a creamy Romola Garai from ""I Capture the Castle"") is supposed to be as naive as Becky is scheming but not a dullard. George Osborne (""Bend It Like Beckham""s Jonathan Rhys Meyers) the cad Amelia loves sticks to petulance as his trademark while William Dobbin (Rhys Ifans) the kind army man who suffers an unrequited love for Amelia is (as so many Ifans characters are more usually for comic effect) a spongeblob. When Gabriel Byrne isnt playing the sinister Marquess of Steyne (who makes Becky an offer she almost cant refuse) as a kind of creepy Zelig hes playing him as a kind of Snidely Whiplash. Most indistinct of all British stage and TV actor James Purefoy plays Beckys husband Rawdon Crawley - a rakish gambler who sees her for what she is - like Mr. Cellophane. Against such bedraggled antagonists the older well-seasoned character actors - among them Bob Hoskins Jim Broadbent and Geraldine McEwan - come on bright but loud like gangbusters or perhaps like players who think theyre in ""Gosford Park."" I love every delectable whoop Eileen Atkins produces as snobby Aunt Matilda Crawley. But when her hilarious performance becomes its own Maggie Smith-ish sideshow there is surely something amiss. ""The beauty of Mira Nairs direction"" Ms. Witherspoon has said to that contemporary chronicler of vanitas vanitatum Liz Smith ""is that this is not a judgment of Becky or any of the characters. There is no good or bad."" Ah but there is my dear or ought to be when the pink - er rose-colored glasses are removed. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Tale of a scheming social climber provides a meaty role for Reese Witherspoon. Stars name and a strong push by Focus toward the large middle rather than the upper end of the specialized market should spell good domestic B.O. An essential 19th century English novel has become a colorful but dramatically just serviceable film in the hands of director Mira Nair. William Makepeace Thackerays tale of a scheming social climber during the Regency period provides a meaty role for Reese Witherspoon who acquits herself capably. But Nairs approach never entirely convinces and the adaptation of the 900-plus-page book becomes increasingly episodic making this ""Vanity Fair"" more a collection of intermittent pleasures than a satisfying emotional repast. Stars name and a strong push by Focus toward the large middle rather than the rarefied upper end of the specialized market should spell good domestic B.O. returns for this accessible but unremarkable costumer. Serialized in 1847-48 Thackerays drolly incisive account of an orphan girls ambitious journey through the English class system 200 years ago has served as the basis for five silent films including an Indian one ""Bahuroopi Bazar"" made in 1932; three British miniseries the last of them in 1998 and one previous major Hollywood sound feature Rouben Mamoulians ""Becky Sharp"" which was notable in 1935 as the first three-color Technicolor production. Given the rich societal setting vibrant heroine and enough personal triumphs and setbacks to fill the bible of a daily soap opera for several seasons -- and also offering choice supporting opportunities most notably for Eileen Atkins and Gabriel Byrne -- it would be hard to make ""Vanity Fair"" a dull affair. Just to make sure Nair has juiced it up with a strong dose of Eastern exoticism that not only reflects the directors own Indian background but those of the rebounding cultural currents of the British imperial project that was then in the ascendant. But there are deficiencies at the very heart of this adaptation penned initially by the team of Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet and rewritten by ""Gosford Park"" scribe Julian Fellowes which serve to deprive the story of a strong spine. This Becky Sharp is endowed with more humanity and well-rounded qualities than is the norm which increases her dimensionality as a character. But this decision also dulls Sharps blade replacing her calculating ruthlessness with in Witherspoons interpretation something closer to mere determination. The change removes much of the breathless astonishment out of the characters rise and eventual fall. And whether as a result of lack of actor chemistry or abridged storytelling or both Beckys marriage to an irresponsible aristocrat remains largely a cipher here serving to slip the rug out from under the feet of one of the storys central relationships. Poor but well schooled young Becky takes her first important step into the moneyed world when she becomes governess to the children of Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins) head of a family of musty Hampshire aristocrats. A lesser woman could easily die on the vine in such stultifying environs but beauteous Becky engages the interest of handsome family heir-apparent Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy) and in another way that spiky old Aunt Matilda (Atkins) who relishes Beckys frank wit and eventually invites the self-confident young redhead to join her in London. Thus Becky arrives on the major stage for which she fancies she was made. Her best friend from school Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai) is seeing a dashingly snide young man George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who has the audacity to peg Becky thus ""I had thought she was a social climber; I can see now shes a mountaineer."" While both are involved with impressive young army officers the two friends are on opposite social tracks. Unlike Becky who thinks she is assuring herself of security and status when she marries Rawdon and bears his son the comfortably raised Amelia isnt driven to push herself ever-upwards although her modest status compels Georges merchant father (Jim Broadbent) to insist his son break with Amelia and marry into great wealth. This demand is illustrated in one of the films more amusing scenes of George and a prospective arranged bride bluntly getting down to the nitty-gritty. Several of the best sequences hinge on characters boldly speaking their minds in contrast with the mannered politesse and hypocritical posturing that defines much of the social intercourse; its Beckys plain speaking that piques Matildas interest and when the mighty Marquess of Steyne (Byrne) who ultimately becomes Beckys benefactor brutally puts his ghastly wife and daughters in their place its like the pronouncement of a god from Mount Olympus. At the halfway point the action shifts to Brussels in 1815. With Napoleons forces converging on Waterloo the English enjoy a final dress ball on the eve of the fateful battle. The death of Amelias husband sets the widow into a steep decline while Beckys descent is more gradual with Rawdons gambling and dissolute ways only slowly taking their toll. Tremendous story compression makes it unclear why a woman like Becky her eye always on the prize would stick with a man like Rawdon through thin as well as thick and lack of visible aging for many characters makes time-jumping hard to gauge. Pic takes on a very disjointed feel in the second half and with the exception of Beckys compromised relationship with Steyne the thread of the personal dynamics becomes frayed. Although it can be justified by the minor presence of Indian elements in the novel (Thackeray was in fact born in Calcutta) the emphasis on Eastern motifs nonetheless seems like an affectation as often as not. Still this is not nearly as serious a problem as is the generally lackluster direction. Redressed streets in Bath double marvelously for Mayfair and production designer Maria Djurkovic and costume designer Beatrix Aruna Pasztor make a point of filling every frame with color. But with the exception of the exchanges involving the shamefully entertaining Atkins and the reservedly insinuating Byrne even the sharper dialogue falls somewhat flat. What style the film possesses seems applied rather than innate. Having broken in her English accent two years ago in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" Witherspoon acquits herself honorably on that score as well as in her interpretation which emphasizes intuition and intelligence over brazenness and cunning. Approach makes Becky less distasteful than other incarnations but also perhaps less emblematic of what Thackeray had in mind. Other thesps including Hoskins Meyers and Rhys Ifans as a long-suffering suitor of Amelias have their moments. Natasha Little who appears here in the supporting role of Lady Jane Sheepshanks portrayed Becky Sharp in the well-regarded 1998 BBC miniseries.
