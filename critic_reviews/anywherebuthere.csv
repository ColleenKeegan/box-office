And having tried demise last year in Stepmom with little payoff Susan Sarandon plays it larger than life in Anywhere but Here. Wayne Wangs vanilla version of Mona Simpsons best-selling 1986 novel centers on an irrepressible single mother who could stand a little tamping down; her anxious overly mature teenage daughter who could stand a little lightening up; and the resilient love between the two that allows each to find equilibrium without losing their bond. And Ive got to say noisy liveliness suits Sarandon far better than stoic suffering. The actress is far too forceful too erotically charged and too confrontational to play out her Oscar hopes on a sickbed--even if the dying woman is allowed a special moment to dance around the house with the kids singing ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" into a hairbrush. Sarandon is also at a great point in her career to play mothers whose sexual motors are still very much in gear. (The beauty of her performance in 1994s Little Women was that her Marmee while covered up in crinolines clearly knew marital happiness with Father and conveyed the value of that satisfaction to her girls.) Remember when Roseanne was gassing on about redoing Absolutely Fabulous for an American public in no need of a remake? Sarandon would have made an awesome Edina. Come to think of it Sarandons Adele August is Edina in Anywhere but Here -- blithe pushy not a little foolish but also brave. And Ann (Natalie Portman) is akin to Edinas put-upon conservative daughter Saffron -- patiently and often resentfully watching out for Mom while Mom expresses herself in grandiose gestures of youthful risk taking. Adele (who shows all the early symptoms of aging into a devouring Terms of Endearment-al Aurora Greenway including an overweening fondness for scarves) removes Ann from Bay City Wis. where Ann was very happy with her granny (Eileen Ryan) and her adored cousin Benny (Shawn Hatosy from Outside Providence) and brings her to glamorous Beverly Hills because Adele feels stifled surrounded by such unimaginative squareness. (She also leaves a kind dull husband behind.) In L.A. living in a sparse apartment but with lush dreams -- she gives the place a peachy coat of paint for emphasis -- mother urges daughter to become an actress; mother has a one-night stand with an unctuous dentist (Hart Bochner) and decides hes her dream man even though hes clearly just a cute weasel; mother fights with daughter about the girls desire for stability security and the right to separate from the person she loves and hates most in the world. And with each tussle and reunion Wang steps back way back and lets the women have the floor. Its almost as if he wants to get out of their way without getting whomped. With The Joy Luck Club the Hong Kong-born director proved that he can choreograph a company of women with great refinement. But two generations of hot-wired all-Americans require a different kind of maintenance than a corps of Chinese and Chinese-American mothers and daughters. And Wangs tendency to steer clear of extremity -- to stage even painful battles with exasperating neutralizing ""fairness"" -- mutes Sarandons exciting brassiness and leaves 18-year-old Portman in her first extended non-Amidala role far too much on her own. The agreeable self-possessed young actress acquits herself nicely against her famous starry colleague but at a price Shes too agreeable and self-possessed. Portman in effect looks out for Sarandon in the same ways Ann accommodates Adele. In the end indeed whats missing from this by-the-numbers drama is a sense of abandon. Everything were ever going to know about Adele and Ann is evident from the start; there are no surprises not even in the creamy precision of Roger Deakins lambent cinematography. (Hold this thought for a few weeks until the release of Tumbleweeds a strikingly similar story told strikingly differently.) Adele August is a large presence in Anywhere but Here but the picture is unnecessarily small. On the bright side her health is never in jeopardy.

"Anywhere But Here - Here Heartfelt Well-Crafted Weepie | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Anywhere But Here - Here Heartfelt Well-Crafted Weepie Emanuel Levy 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 20 1999 | 1200AM PT Centering on the turbulent but loving relationship between a single mother and her rebellious teenage daughter Wayne Wangs ""Anywhere But Here"" is a sumptuously crafted but extremely old-fashioned comedy-drama made in the manner of Hollywood weepies of yesteryear. Natalie Portman whos rapidly becoming one of the most accomplished young screen actresses working today lends excellent support to Susan Sarandons turn as her eccentric but ultimately self-sacrificing mother. Targeting the same audiences who went for ""Stepmom"" Sarandons last foray into maternal fare this heartfelt film which exploits two of Hollywoods most reliable formats --- the road movie and the intergenerational meller --- should do above-mid-range numbers somewhere between the B.O. of Wangs 1993 ""The Joy Luck Club"" and ""Stepmom."" Centering on the turbulent but loving relationship between a single mother and her rebellious teenage daughter Wayne Wangs ""Anywhere But Here"" is a sumptuously crafted but extremely old-fashioned comedy-drama made in the manner of Hollywood weepies of yesteryear. Natalie Portman whos rapidly becoming one of the most accomplished young screen actresses working today lends excellent support to Susan Sarandons turn as her eccentric but ultimately self-sacrificing mother. Targeting the same audiences who went for ""Stepmom"" Sarandons last foray into maternal fare this heartfelt film which exploits two of Hollywoods most reliable formats -- the road movie and the intergenerational meller -- should do above-mid-range numbers somewhere between the B.O. of Wangs 1993 ""The Joy Luck Club"" and ""Stepmom."" As he has demonstrated in previous work particularly ""Joy Luck"" and ""Dim Sum A Little Bit of Heart"" Wangs sensitive humanistic approach is best suited to emotional stories about women. Though new pic is set in 1995 and is based on Mona Simpsons 1986 novel a good deal of the film registers as an updated version of the King Vidor version of ""Stella Dallas"" with Sarandons crude working-class woman reminiscent of Barbara Stanwycks role in the 1937 film. Pic also will draw comparisons to Scorseses 1974 ""Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore"" and Gavin OConnors upcoming ""Tumbleweeds"" both of which are more interesting pictures than Wangs; these moralistic sagas revolve around ""irresponsible"" or immature middle-aged women who hit the road with their children in search of a better more meaningful life. In the first scene Adele (Sarandon) and 14-year-old Ann (Portman) are zooming down the highway in their 1978 Mercedes heading toward the promised land of Beverly Hills. Against Anns will theyre leaving Bay City Wis. a provincial town Adele finds stifling. Through endless bickering and brief flashbacks crucial background is conveyed how Ann has never met her Egyptian biological father how Adele walked out on Anns stepfather how the big car was recklessly bought and so on. Ann is furious over losing the cozy family and social life she enjoyed in Bay City with her grandmother Lillian (Eileen Ryan) cousin Benny (Shawn Hatosy) and intimate friends. While not quite a stage mother Adele is pushing her daughter into acting hoping that life in sunny Los Angeles will fulfill her dreams. Their first stop is the Beverly Hills Hotel a symbol of Adeles quest. But they cant afford it and instead settle into a Travelodge motel. A random meeting with a real estate agent Gail (Caroline Aaron) leads them to an apartment in Beverly Hills and over the course of a year they move from one shabby place to another. Whenever shes down Adele forces Ann to go shopping with her or join her for a meal in an expensive restaurant. Theres a basic role reversal Ann is more realistic and pragmatic than her flighty mom. Indeed Ann is quicker to realize that her mothers one-night stand with Josh (Hart Bochner) is just that while Adele keeps calling him hoping hell take her to the opera. Ann goes through a painful coming of age underlined by her studying in a new school and her eager desire to meet her father. In a touching scene Ann calls her dad but he misperceives the gesture as a request for money. Turning point in the central relationship occurs when Adele sneaks into an audition that she had forced upon her daughter and is shocked to see Ann deliver a monologue that mimics her words and gestures. Throughout Alvin Sargents scenario recalls quintessential scenes and characters from Hollywood tearjerkers. The motif of a daughter embarrassed by her moms behavior and tasteless attire is reminiscent of ""Stella Dallas."" The tough character of real estate agent Gail who becomes Adeles buddy is similar to the roles played by Eve Arden in ""Mildred Pierce"" and by Diane Ladd in ""Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore."" Pics first hour is unexciting and Sarandons broad rendition makes the material unbearably familiar; this is one of her least subtle perfs. But the story improves as it unfolds and the tension between mom and daughter when latter decides to attend an East Coast college is particularly well handled. Even so it may be telling that some of the most emotionally honest scenes involve interaction between Ann and other young characters. Theres a priceless scene in which Ann and Benny candidly talk about their feelings and sexuality. There are also several deftly and humorously observed scenes in which Ann is courted by a handsome classmate (Ray Baker). Sarandons acting gets more multi-shaded and refined in the last reel but the revelation here is Portman whose casting was reportedly Sarandons condition for making the movie. With half a dozen roles to her credit Portman is a natural performer who brings rough edges to any role she plays -- the movie is inconceivable without her. Wangs staging is less astute than in his other work but he directs with clarity stressing crowd-pleasing and tear-jerking moments. This kind of manipulation with at least four scenes in which the protagonists themselves burst out crying has always been integral to the genre. Pics main modernist touch is Roger Deakins crisp widescreen lensing which elevates the story a couple of notches above the conventional sensibility of its source material.

And having tried demise last year in Stepmom with little payoff Susan Sarandon plays it larger than life in Anywhere but Here. Wayne Wangs vanilla version of Mona Simpsons best-selling 1986 novel centers on an irrepressible single mother who could stand a little tamping down; her anxious overly mature teenage daughter who could stand a little lightening up; and the resilient love between the two that allows each to find equilibrium without losing their bond. And Ive got to say noisy liveliness suits Sarandon far better than stoic suffering. The actress is far too forceful too erotically charged and too confrontational to play out her Oscar hopes on a sickbed--even if the dying woman is allowed a special moment to dance around the house with the kids singing ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" into a hairbrush. Sarandon is also at a great point in her career to play mothers whose sexual motors are still very much in gear. (The beauty of her performance in 1994s Little Women was that her Marmee while covered up in crinolines clearly knew marital happiness with Father and conveyed the value of that satisfaction to her girls.) Remember when Roseanne was gassing on about redoing Absolutely Fabulous for an American public in no need of a remake? Sarandon would have made an awesome Edina. Come to think of it Sarandons Adele August is Edina in Anywhere but Here -- blithe pushy not a little foolish but also brave. And Ann (Natalie Portman) is akin to Edinas put-upon conservative daughter Saffron -- patiently and often resentfully watching out for Mom while Mom expresses herself in grandiose gestures of youthful risk taking. Adele (who shows all the early symptoms of aging into a devouring Terms of Endearment-al Aurora Greenway including an overweening fondness for scarves) removes Ann from Bay City Wis. where Ann was very happy with her granny (Eileen Ryan) and her adored cousin Benny (Shawn Hatosy from Outside Providence) and brings her to glamorous Beverly Hills because Adele feels stifled surrounded by such unimaginative squareness. (She also leaves a kind dull husband behind.) In L.A. living in a sparse apartment but with lush dreams -- she gives the place a peachy coat of paint for emphasis -- mother urges daughter to become an actress; mother has a one-night stand with an unctuous dentist (Hart Bochner) and decides hes her dream man even though hes clearly just a cute weasel; mother fights with daughter about the girls desire for stability security and the right to separate from the person she loves and hates most in the world. And with each tussle and reunion Wang steps back way back and lets the women have the floor. Its almost as if he wants to get out of their way without getting whomped. With The Joy Luck Club the Hong Kong-born director proved that he can choreograph a company of women with great refinement. But two generations of hot-wired all-Americans require a different kind of maintenance than a corps of Chinese and Chinese-American mothers and daughters. And Wangs tendency to steer clear of extremity -- to stage even painful battles with exasperating neutralizing ""fairness"" -- mutes Sarandons exciting brassiness and leaves 18-year-old Portman in her first extended non-Amidala role far too much on her own. The agreeable self-possessed young actress acquits herself nicely against her famous starry colleague but at a price Shes too agreeable and self-possessed. Portman in effect looks out for Sarandon in the same ways Ann accommodates Adele. In the end indeed whats missing from this by-the-numbers drama is a sense of abandon. Everything were ever going to know about Adele and Ann is evident from the start; there are no surprises not even in the creamy precision of Roger Deakins lambent cinematography. (Hold this thought for a few weeks until the release of Tumbleweeds a strikingly similar story told strikingly differently.) Adele August is a large presence in Anywhere but Here but the picture is unnecessarily small. On the bright side her health is never in jeopardy.

Starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If Natalie Portman had to be judged by her performance in ""Star Wars Episode I -- The Phantom Menace"" no one would have any idea what a brilliant actress she is. Intergalactic spectacles arent exactly kind to actors -- unless you count the exposure -- and Portman was in equal parts underused and overdressed as Queen Amidala. ""Anywhere But Here"" which opens today is another species. Playing the sensitive daughter of a flamboyant unstable mother Portman gives one of the best performances of the year. Shes not just good; shes phenomenally good in the way that Jodie Foster was as a teen and preteen. Portman seems to draw from some creative well that most actors only dream of Shes incapable of giving a line reading thats less than honest and she makes acting look perfectly easy. She raises the bar for other actresses and she almost upstages her formidable co-star Susan Sarandon. Based on the novel by Mona Simpson and directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"") ""Anywhere But Here"" stars Sarandon as Adele August a restless soul from Bay City Wis. who wants a better zestier more brilliantly Technicolor life for herself and her daughter. It doesnt matter that her sensitive 14- year-old daughter Ann (Portman) is perfectly happy where she is and so attached to her cousin Benny (Shawn Hatosy) that the thought of leaving home is excruciating. Off they go in a 1978 Mercedes through the Southwestern landscapes that Sarandon explored in ""Thelma amp; Louise"" landing in Beverly Hills. Wang is no stranger to mother-daughter stories having directed ""The Joy Luck Club"" and the wonderful ""Dim Sum"" be fore that. In ""Anywhere But Here"" he explores the sort of role reversal that ""Absolutely Fabulous"" spoofed so broadly a mother whos vivacious exasperating and desperate to remain young and a daughter whos precocious grounded and running out of patience. Sarandon has played mothers in the past including the angelic Marmee in ""Little Women"" but never a character as selfish or obtuse as this. Adeles the kind of woman whos fun at first and progressively more irritating each time she appears. In clinical terms shes probably a narcissist determined to have her way full of self-delusion and oblivious to the impact she has on other people. Adele wants Ann to be an actress but Ann thinks thats ridiculous. Adele makes a play for a good-looking orthodontist (Hart Bochner) but blows it by coming on too strong. The power goes out in their shabby apartment and Adele thinks the solution is to go out to a fancy restaurant they cant afford. ""When life gets rough and you only have a dime in your pocket"" she chirps ""go get your shoes shined."" Sarandon and Portman work beautifully -- together negotiating a range of emotional keys that blend comedy and drama in the same moment. Movies about moms and daughters frequently turn mushy and manipulative -- think ""Terms of Endearment"" -- but ""Anywhere But Here"" with a strong script by Alvin Sargent (""Julia"" ""Ordinary People"") has more class than that. The film is full of terrific scenes but one in particular stands out Portman and Sarandon have gone to the airport to drop off a relative when Portman just to see what will happen ducks behind a pillar. Sarandon panics and Portman watches and in that moment we learn more about the complexity of her feelings for her mother and her awareness of her mothers love than any dialogue scene could have told us. Wang has such a great way with actors and scores so solidly with ""Anywhere But Here"" that it seems almost a shame to point out a technical flaw that he repeats Every time Sarandon is driving through Beverly Hills she spends all her time looking at the lush homes or her daughter in the passenger seat -- never at the road. ..
