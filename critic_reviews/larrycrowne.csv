Its a namby-pamby adjective a lackluster word one that conveys nothing more specific or more urgent than a sort of warm all-approving glow. ""Larry Crowne"" the new comedy that Tom Hanks has directed and co-written (with ""My Big Fat Greek Weddings"" Nia Vardalos) is ... nice. Too nice in fact. Also read Paul Greengrass May Direct Tom Hanks in Somali Pirate Movie This is Hanks second try at directing a feature film his first being 1996s ""That Thing You Do"" in which he had only a supporting role. In ""Larry Crowne"" he puts himself front and center as the title character. ""Thats Crowne with an E "" his character keeps telling people. Larry a friendly convivial guy is a retired Navy cook who has made a second career for himself as a sales clerk at a big box Walmart-ish store. When hes called in by management he figures hes about to be named Employee of the Month for the 10th time. Instead hes fired. His lack of a college degree means hes not on the management track and so bye-bye. Rather than stew over this Larry enrolls at the local community college and signs up for a course in public speaking taught by Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts) an academic with advanced degrees whos trapped in a lousy job and even lousier marriage. (Her husband amusingly played by ""Breaking Bads"" Bryan Cranston is a stay-at-home writer who wastes his days surfing on-line porn.) Larry does well in school. Larry makes new friends. Larry learns to dress better and acquires a gas-sipping scooter. Larry finds a new part-time job. Larry becomes the teachers pet. All of which is fine and dandy. But hey a movie needs a little conflict now and then. ""Larry Crowne"" is so flaccid -- and so kind to all its characters -- that it feels like it was written with a Q-tip. And then there are all those gaping holes and undeveloped plot threads. If Larry was in the Navy for 20 years doesnt he have a pension? For how long was he married - and when exactly did he get divorced? And how did Mercedes get stuck in this crummy job? Jokes are set up but theres no build or payoff. Theres an amusing scene where Mercedes while driving in her car sings along loudly to ""Im Called Little Buttercup"" from ""H.M.S. Pinafore."" Is she a Gilbert and Sullivan fan? Did she once perform in the comic opera? Does she fancy herself a singer? The movie provides no answers and never returns to the topic. With so little going on this rom-com depends heavily on the skills and charm of its leads. Fortunately Hanks and Roberts are both savvy performers and they deliver here -- at least to the extent that for the 90 or so minutes youre watching the movie youre not too unhappy to be there. But this is for both of them an exceedingly minor entry on already impressive resumes. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

A pinch of cinnamon a dash of sugar or a drop of Tabasco has enhanced many a disastrous dried-out holiday feast but even the combined flavors of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts cant salvage a turkey like Larry Crowne. During a surfeit of vampires vulgarity 3-D action comic books CGI effects and worse I applaud Mr. Hankss effort to write produce and direct a harmless romantic comedy that exists for no other reason than unpretentious entertainment but even with nothing else on its mind a so-called ""comedy"" should engage the senses on some level besides the funny bone. This one just lays there like road kill. The title character is a middle-aged man who works in a chain store opening boxes and pushing long links of used shopping carts through the parking lot. Hes likeable and hard-working hes been voted Employee of the Month nine times and hes in line for a promotion. Instead he finds himself a victim of corporate ""restructuring"" a modern term for ""Youre fired"" Why? Because he never went to college. How could he? He spent 20 years in the Navy instead. On top of that his wife leaves him and takes his assets he cant get a loan because his house is not worth what he owes and he has to dispose of everything including his treasured old record collection exchange his gas-guzzling suburban S.U.V. for a moped and put his house on the market. Humiliated and hurt with no job and no prospects he cheerfully (hes always cheerful even when life kicks him in the gonads) enrolls in a community college. Its not Harvard but neither are the teachers. Julia Roberts plays a disillusioned sour-faced public-speaking professor named Mercedes Tainot (where do they get these names?) who teaches students to give lectures on ""pop topics"" such as the difference between Star Trek and Star Wars. She hates her job convinced shes wasting her time but Larry knows that underneath that pickle puss is a gooey Julia Roberts grin and a honking Julia Roberts laugh just waiting to explode. Before it does we get a glimpse of her home life (too much alcohol marriage to a slacker geek who spends the day watching internet pornography inevitable divorce). While waiting for her to thaw Larry works as a short order cook in a greasy spoon diner mastering the art of French toast and with his new haircut and the alias ""Lance Corona"" joins a motorcycle gang with a passion for feng shui. Would I lie to you? Who could make these things up? In an endurance test of 99 minutes that feels more like running a marathon on the Equator nothing ever happens in this movie. There is no conflict. The characters are dead on arrival. Except for a walk-on by Rita Wilson (better known as Mrs. Tom Hanks) Ive never heard of anyone in the supporting cast for reasons that become instantly clear. This is odd since Mr. Hanks knows so much about acting that I expected him at the very least to coax a few memorable performances out of his fellow players through osmosis if nothing else. But nothing rubs off. Theyre a dull lot. Nothing sparks to life. Told in short vignettes the film lacks shape the lazy jokes take too long to set up and the pauses following the punch lines seem to be waiting for a laugh track. Even the stars fail to muster much personality. When teacher and student finally kiss its both unconvincing and preposterous. Who is to blame? Is it the star who rarely makes mistakes in pulling the strings of his own career? Or was it his co-writer Nia Vardalos who concocted the dreadful farce My Big Fat Greek Wedding? Somebody must be held accountable for clunky unspeakable dialogue like ""Youre whining like a goo-goo ga-ga baby."" Explaining her drunk scene the night before Ms. Roberts says ""I was worked up and under the influence of the demon rum."" I mean who talks like that outside the pages of paperbacks for hyper-thyroidal teens sold in airport departure lounges? I wouldnt go so far as announcing that Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have passed their prime but even if you wander into this congealed mess with nothing more demanding in mind than to spend a little time with two charming favorites do not expect Forrest Gump or Pretty Woman. Congenial is the word for Larry Crowne but its as flat as an ironing board. rreedobserver.com LARRY CROWNE Running time 99 minutes Written by Tom Hanks and Nia Vardalos Directed by Tom Hanks Starring Tom Hanks Julia Roberts 1/4 Comment Filed under College Comedy Degree Julia Roberts movie News amp; Politics Review romance Romantic Comedy Tom Hanks Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/07/movie-review-larry-crowne-offers-an-affair-to-forget/,200,larrycrowne3,larrycrowne,observer

Henson George Takei Watch Clips Its Larry Crowne Its Larry Crowne Credit Universal Studios Take Off Your Pants Take Off Your Pants Credit Universal Studios In the lumbering new dramedy Larry Crowne Tom Hanks directs and plays a Gump-ishly good-hearted salesman whose fondest dream is to rack up yet another Employee of the Month at the Walmart-like megastore where he has worked ever since retiring from the Navy. Instead Larry finds himself abruptly terminated on the trumped-up excuse that he is insufficiently schooled to qualify as management material. Divorced with no kids and saddled with a mortgage he cant afford Larry must reinvent himself and as you will already have guessed it takes a village. Inspired by Hanks experiences as a community college student Larry Crowne takes its square hero back to school where a multiracial rainbow of good-humored kooks -- among them Cedric the Entertainer as Larrys yard-sale-obsessed neighbor and George Takei as a compulsively laughing economics professor -- stands ready to loosen him up and stiffen his spine for a post-plenty world. Equipped by an ebullient young classmate (British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw) with a used Vespa and a thrift-store sartorial makeover Larry emerges retooled as a pretty cool self-starter. There is no union strikes or rioting in the streets for Larry and friends. This being America there will be gobs of can-do enterprise and the promise of a rejuvenating romance with Teacher. Given the times theres ample room for a rollicking comedy a serious drama or both about life after layoff. Neither fish nor fowl Larry Crowne skitters between pathos and shtick wasting abundant acting talent as it goes. When the pacing falls slack Hanks turns to veteran composer James Newton Howard for a boost but his overbearing score is sprinkled liberally with treacle. Hanks wrote Larry Crowne with Nia Vardalos of My Big Fat Greek Wedding fame and this is a similarly chipper empty vessel whose creaky script laden with one-liners goes hand in hand with a host of fatigued sight gags. Buried beneath the leaden bromides touting the virtues of the scaled-down life there lurks a genuinely urgent question about how working people will rebuild their lives out of the wreckage of an economy that has destroyed not only job security but very likely the full-time job as we know it. i Cedric the Entertainer (from left) Tom Hanks and Taraji P. Henson demonstrate the virtues of thrift stores and garage sales but the films design for living doesnt connect. Bruce Talamon/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Bruce Talamon/Universal Studios Cedric the Entertainer (from left) Tom Hanks and Taraji P. Henson demonstrate the virtues of thrift stores and garage sales but the films design for living doesnt connect. Bruce Talamon/Universal Studios Where the far more unsettling 2009 movie Up in the Air debated that question and showed a willingness to confront real desperation Larry Crowne sews it up neatly with a smug faux-populism that talks down to the very people it seeks to address and champion. Which may be why the only performance remotely worth rooting for among Hanks cloying gallery of adorables is Julia Roberts quietly enraged turn as Larrys jaded professor a woman stranded in a rotten marriage and a precarious job who has all but lost interest in motivating her students to become effective public speakers. Being the kind of film that it is Larry Crowne will in due course regress her into the dewy-eyed hair-tossing mode Roberts is so clearly chafing to leave behind. But not before she has squeezed in a potently unsettling portrait of grit-your-teeth despair laced with simmering fury. With any luck it will secure for Roberts a big ol Meryl Streep of a career after 40.

Although the story quickly proceeds through familiar hallmarks of recent years -- the fruitless job search the necessary yard sales and looming foreclosure -- this is not a recession story. Hanks who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay with his friend Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) isnt trying to bring anyone down. Larry Crowne is a reinvention tale at times cloying but not without small charms. Its about as substantial as a pep rally and serves the same function. Larry has long been U-Marts most conscientious employee. In the morning he scans the empty parking lot with happy anticipation of another day in retail sales. But as they let him go his bosses explain that since Larry didnt go to college he cant advance in management. (Should he have joined a class action suit? Oh right -- no point.) He joined the Navy right out of high school cooked his way around the world on ships for 20 years. Hes humble and kind a swell guy. In another era Jimmy Stewart could have played him. On the advice of his jovial neighbor Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer) who runs a perpetual yard sale on his front lawn with his wife BElla (Taraji Henson) Larry enrolls at a community college. He tells the dean he wants to make sure hes never downsized again (and no one squashes his hopes by telling him that college provides no such protection). Part of his plan is to downsize his own lifestyle; he leaves his gas guzzler in the driveway and uses a scooter courtesy of Lamar to get about the San Fernando Valley. Brave man. (See ""Tom Hanks Americas Chronicler-in-Chief"") The prop speaks volumes about the movie. If there is a cuter peppier mode of transport than a scooter I havent seen it. Its the careful placement of the feet that does it dainty a little mannered the mechanized version of riding sidesaddle. Arriving to school by scooter Larry immediately falls in with a cozy little campus clique of fellow scooter enthusiasts headed by bubbly Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Talia takes Larry under her wing she shows him how to text nicknames him Lance Corona and reforms his hair and wardrobe. She buzzes around him with such bubbly goodwill that his prickly public-speaking teacher (and love interest naturally) Mercedes ""Mercy"" Tainot (Julia Roberts) is prompted to remark ""What do men see in irritating free spirits?"" Thank you Mercy. Your bitterness is overdone but at least you provide the voice of reason here. Talia is sadly the only means Hanks and Vardalos came up with to get Larry from Point A (dorkiness) to Point B (worthy of wooing the hot teacher). The nine other students taking Mercys class ""Speech 217 The Art of Informal Remarks"" are an agreeable enough lot although wholly predictable. Theres the hearty athlete (Grace Gummer) the texting dope (Rami Malek) and the shy middle-aged lady (Maria Canals-Barrera). Larrys economics professor (George Takei) is cutely eccentric. The whole community-college gang is the diet version of the Danish movie Italian for Beginners a more charming tale featuring grown-ups going back to school. Hanks is endearing and Roberts is as deft as ever with unchallenging material; hes Tom shes Julia. Dont worry be happy. Id take Larry Crowne to task for its lack of tension but I dont believe Hanks or Vardalos ever had narrative tension on their radar. Casting Roberts as the love interest is a guarantee that Larry is going to be just fine. Theirs is a placid romance -- Mercy and Larry share one long kiss thats more like a wrestling match than anything sensual -- but then again this is a staid movie aimed at an older audience. Edgeless it takes a wistful hopeful approach to heartbreak and job loss. Thats sweet but when it comes to unemployment-themed cinema Ill take the greater realism of last years The Company Men or this years Everything Must Go over Hankss too rosy vision of life after the pink slip.

Plus the power of Project Nim. By David Edelstein Published Jul 1 2011 ShareThis (Photo Bruce Talamon/Courtesy of VendUme International) Even as I enjoyed the Tom HanksJulia Roberts comedy Larry Crowne I found it easy to understand why its trailer is so so lamethe tagline might as well be Come Smile Awhile. The cutesy bits of business need the edgier context of the film. Hanks who wrote it with Nia Vardalos and directed plays Larry a cheerful innocuous fellow who loses his job at a big-box store (U-Mart) cant scrounge up another and decides to take college coursesone of them in public speaking taught by the bitter brittle Mercedes Tainot (Roberts). The film is sometimes gentle to the point of blandness but its never flimsy. Its actually one of the subtler portraits Ive seen of middle-class life in the age of corporate capitalism and of people who survive without becoming zombie wage-slaves or pinko malcontents (not that some pinko malcontents arent convincing). The movie earns its hopeful vision. Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson brought Vardaloss My Big Fat Greek Wedding to the screen and Larry Crowne (which features Wilson as a chillingly chipper bank officer) centers on families biological and surrogate the kind that keep you warm in a mercenary and isolating culture. Rocked by the price of gas for his SUV Larry buys a vintage scooter from his neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer) who with his wife (Taraji P. Henson) maintains an ongoing lawn sale. So buying and selling can be neighborly. The bike makes Larry part of a larger community a darling scooter gang led by fellow student Talia (the vivacious Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who redesigns Larrys dweeby wardrobe. Larry Crowne is practically a personal-finance primerand wouldnt you know that Larrys other course is Economics 1 (taught by the hammily stentorian George Takei) whose textbook inspires him to dump the overmortgaged house and live more lightly on the Earth. See AlsoDavid Edelstein on Transformers Dark of the Moon For many viewers of course the suspense will come not from waiting for Larry to balance his checkbook but for Robertss big dour mouth to quiver and twist and then any time now here it comes Julia smiles And Julia is wonderful as she often is when she plays uptight. Watch her face as she enters her first class and sees ninenot the state-mandated minimum of tenstudents Its the relief of a sourpuss who truly would rather not deal with other human beings especially in the morning with a hangover. Mercedes is also fed up with her indolent porn-loving blogger husband played by Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston. The Internet blogging These arent healthy things in the personal-touch world of Larry Crowne. Mercedes needs a meetup. And as she watches Larry speak to the class her long legs angled demurely under her desk she begins to be interested. Its too bad that Larry as played by Hanks isnt especially interesting. In his U-Mart job he seems slow like Forrest Gumps slightly smarter brother. But then Hanks settles into a groove of easy acceptance. Is he so self-effacing because hes the director and wants to throw the spotlight on his leading lady and multiracial ensemble? Or does he think Larrys lack of remarkableness will make him more relatable? I almost wish Larry Crowne had been made by someone elseJonathan Demme say a producer on Hankss directorial debut That Thing You Do and someone whod have pushed him to be faster on the uptake. Hankss quickness is his gift the thing that made him a star but over the years he has taken too much off his fastball. Bump up Larry s IQ by twenty points and Larry Crowne would be an event instead of a pleasant humanist comedy thats also a paean to dullness. You get a bad feeling early in Project Nim the brilliant traumatizing documentary by James Marsh (Man on Wire). Nim was a chimpanzee whoI cant bring myself to use thatin 1973 became a test subject for Columbia psychology professor Herbert Terrace. The prof speculated that if a chimp were raised like a child and taught sign language a door would be opened into the animal mind to chimp thoughts emotions even dreams. Given the nature of a chimp brain Terraces ambitions seem a tad unrealistic but the problem is not that he was wrongits that when he was wrong he lost interest along with funding. Terrace returned Nim whod spent years romping around peoples houses and had learned 125 signs to a cage in the lab where hed been snatched from his mother. To the people involved Nim was a science project not a damaged soul. See AlsoThe Tragic Tale of a Chimp Raised As a Boy in Project Nim Project is a verb too and the bitter humor and sadness of Project Nim come from hearing how humans projected like mad on the poor chimp. His first human mother Stephanie LaFarge breast-fed Nim let him puff on a joint and worried about language constraining his animal nature. (You want to slap your forehead.) Taken from LaFarge and her family Nim spent his days with a nice pretty student who inexplicably went to bed with Professor Terrace and then explicably decamped. Later on Nim bit through the cheek of another gal and amid the blood and gore signed Im sorry. And that was before the cages the horrific NYU lab and the animal refuge funded by Cleveland Amory that turned out to be worst of all. Marshs documentaries are inspired fusions of content and style and here the artistry intensifies the pain. The reenactments are so convincing its a shock to see actors names in the creditsnot to mention names of animatronic designers Project Nim is emotionally exhausting and while its tempting to label Terrace the villain no one is totally bad or goodeven Nims best bud the Deadhead Bob Ingersoll smoked dope with him. Nim opened a door all right but to the human not animal mind. And were some crazy species. Correction An earlier version of this review stated that Nim went to a Columbia University lab after the experiment. It was actually a NYU lab. Larry Crowne Directed by Tom Hanks. PG-13.

"Larry Crowne movie review Unrelenting niceness is not an asset in improbable comedy |       NJ.com comments Larry Crowne movie review Unrelenting niceness is not an asset in improbable comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 01 2011 at 721 AM View/Post Comments Bruce Talamon Academy Award winners Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks come together for a romantic comedy in ""Larry Crowne."" MOVIE REVIEW There are a lot of times when nice is wonderful. You want ""nice"" in a preschool teacher. You want ""nice"" in a present for your elderly aunt. You want ""nice"" in the first meal you sit down to after a bout of stomach flu. Nice in a comedy though is -- well not so nice. Tom Hanks though -- who directed co-wrote and co-stars in the new ""Larry Crowne"" -- is pretty much the King of Nice. And family friend and co-writer Nia Vardalos is its queen or at least a lady-in-waiting. Not surprisingly what theyve come up with here is polite pleasant and unthreatening. But its about as close to real comedy as a cup of milky tea is to a real meal. Movie Review Larry Crowne (PG-13) Universal (99 min.) Directed by Tom Hanks. With Hanks Julia Roberts. Now playing in New Jersey. Directed by Taylor Hackford. With Helen Mirren Joe Pesci. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains some mildly suggestive humor and strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS The idea of the story is that our hero Larry -- a longtime sales clerk at a Walmart-style store -- is being fired because he doesnt have a college degree. (Which starts the story off on a false note -- isnt he exactly the sort of loyal minimum-wage employee that big-box stores depend on?) But no matter. Because then Larry decides to go to community college. Where he falls for his teacher who looks like Julia Roberts and sings Gilbert and Sullivan in her car. And where he falls in with a gang of kids who ride Vespas and go to yard sales for fun. Nice. But not terribly funny or rooted in recognizable characters. We see Tom Hanks rambling around Larrys overpriced suburban house and driving his gas-guzzling SUV and hear him mention an ex-wife. But what went wrong? What was his life like before we met him? We meet Julia Roberts playing an unhappy and hostile character as she often seems to in movies these days. (If she were any more brittle that famous smile would crack her in two.) But how did she get here? The script doesnt know or assumes we dont care; isnt it enough to just sit there and bathe in the warm movie-star glow of ""Tom"" and ""Julia"" as the big type on the posters advertises? Well no it isnt. Roberts has a few good prickly moments and Hanks has one sweet scene where he does the sort of impromptu joyous dance Snoopy used to break into. Theres also a great turn by George Takei of all people playing a decidedly eccentric economics professor. That earns the movie points. So does Vardalos long-held laudable refusal to stoop to dirty jokes (even when we see the internet ""porn"" that Roberts husband constantly surfs its merely women in bikinis). And hats off to Hanks own urge to do something uplifting (he described the movie to Entertainment Weekly magazine as ""a fight against cynicism""). Because yes not every movie needs to be a potty-mouthed ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Bad Teacher."" And boy could we use a new dose of Frank Capra about now. Except those modern dirty comedies have jokes quirky characters and unpredictable stories. And those classic Capra films have real conflicts dramatic twists and endings guaranteed to get you cheering. While all ""Larry Crowne"" has going for it is well a good attitude. Which is nice -- but not much more.

"Larry Crowne reviewed Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts need a better script. Slate Sign In Sign Up Larry Crowne reviewed Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts need a better script. Larry Crowne reviewed Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts need a better script. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 1 2011 318 PM Sleepless on a Scooter Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in the lazy rom-com Larry Crowne. By Dana Stevens Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks in Larry Crowne Im not going to lie I had high hopes for Larry Crowne (Universal Pictures) a romantic comedy directed by co-written by and starring Tom Hanks about a recently laid-off man who goes back to college and falls for his teacher. Some critics I know entered the screening room already scoffing in anticipation of these two middle-aged movie stars exchanging light banter on a scooter. I was primed for light banter on a scooter. Tom Hanks in comic mode can be a delight--his voicing of Woody the cowboy in the Toy Story movies counts as one of the great movie performances of our time. And Julia Roberts who got on my nerves in her Erin Brockovich Americas-sweetheart days has mellowed into an effortlessly self-assured leading lady. Her dry understated line readings can elevate even a mediocre script. But this script--a collaboration between Hanks and Nia Vardalos the writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- would need multiple punch-up sessions to attain mediocrity. Roberts and Hanks arent just prevented from playing their A games; theyre never even taken off the bench. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. My Big Fat Greek Wedding Vardalos wildly successful tale of a Hellenic family in low-stakes crisis took place in a comfortably familiar if cloying rom-com universe; Larry Crowne takes place in no recognizable universe at all. Neither the relationship of the two leads nor any encounter between any of the films other humans seems to proceed according to the emotional or sociological customs of our culture. In what isolated village of the San Fernando Valley do people behave like this and how can I be sure never to go there? Advertisement Larry Crowne (Hanks) works as a manager at a Target-like store called UMart. He loves his job as we learn in an opening-title sequence that shows him lovingly adjusting the product displays and policing the parking lot for litter. One morning his corporate-drone boss (Rob Riggle) calls him in and fires him spouting MBA-speak about how Larrys lack of a college degree is hindering his advancement. (Is a severance package offered? How generous or ungenerous is it? These questions are not just glossed over but ignored by the curiously detail-free screenplay.) Unemployed and recently divorced his mortgage underwater Larry goes into free-fall--but this being a relentlessly upbeat movie its a short fall onto a feather mattress. After a failed shot at applying for retail work he enrolls at a local community college to get his degree. His professors include Ed Matsutani Ph.D. (George Takei) a strict economics prof with a disturbingly sinister laugh and Mercedes Tainot (Roberts) a teacher of speech and English whos burned out on both her job and her marriage. (Ill give the script this Mercedes Tainot is a cool character name.) A young hippie-chick classmate Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) takes Larry under her wing the first day of school. She offers some fashion advice (""A tucked-in polo shirt makes you look like a cop"") then invites him along on a scooter excursion with her friends. (The near-broke Larry has recently downsized from a gas-guzzling van to a scooter.) This subplot about the scooter gang is a good place to examine where Larry Crowne goes wrong. Theres something off about the whole thing. First of all the sheer size of the group There must be 15 or 20 people buzzing by every time we see them scoot. Yet we never see the faces let alone learn the names or stories of any members other than Talia and her boyfriend (Wilmer Valderrama) who gets a few lines--one of them mildly funny--about how hes jealous of Larry. Secondly Why does this band of young multi-ethnic ""cool"" kids (theres a painful moment when they snap their fingers in unison to denote their shared cool) cotton to this dorky older dude? Larry is not without his charms--hes played by Tom Hanks after all--but theres never a scene in which the faceless scooter horde encounters those charms. The bond between Larry and the scooter crew feels synthetic contrived solely for the purposes of providing the character with a cheering section. Theres something undercooked about Larry Crowne a first-draft quality that makes me want to sharpen a red pencil and line-edit Hanks and Vardalos script. First editorial suggestion Scrap the scooter gang. Better yet scrap all the secondary characters and start from scratch. Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson play Larrys next-door neighbors who provide him with pep talks while holding a perpetual yard sale. Pam Grier plays Mercedes teaching colleague who supplies similar moral support dispensing you-go-girl bromides as Roberts jogs on a treadmill. (At one point the two white leads get back-to-back inspirational-black-friend montages making this movie a shoo-in for this years Magical Negro award.) Several early scenes hint that Mercedes is an incipient alcoholic--she rushes home from morning classes to fix herself fruity blender drinks--but this thread is entirely dropped as if falling in love were an addiction cure-all. And the character of Mercedes husband (Bryan Cranston) a lazy porn-surfing failed novelist has to be Julia Roberts least-nuanced cinematic husband since Sleeping With the Enemy. Still buried deep inside this thoroughly fake movie are a couple of tiny moments that gesture toward the film that couldve been had the original idea (which Hanks conceived more than a decade ago)been developed by better writers. Both come when Hanks and Roberts are alone on-screen far from the scooting crowd and the inspiring ethnic buddies. The scene where Roberts and Hanks first kiss on her doorstep--shes drunk and devil-may-care hes sober and terrified--contains a spark of genuine romance one or two laugh-out-loud lines and a funny bit of business involving a home alarm system. Later he stares at her over the lunch counter where hes working with a look that for the first and only moment in this blandly inoffensive movie clearly spells ""sex."" Yes the fiftysomething Hanks and the fortysomething Roberts are older than most rom-com stars but its not the stars age that makes Larry Crowne so discomforting. Its the movies lazy reliance on their veteran Hollywood charm. ""Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts fall in love"" is a pitch not a plot. Get me rewrite.

Welcome to Counter Programming Weekend at hundreds of multiplexes across this great land of ours. On a number of screens youll find two authentic movie stars at play. And if Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks arent exactly whetting their acting chops in the slight amiable dramedy ""Larry Crowne"" the pair do bathe the audience (likely female) in klieg-light wattage. Those lines of people with 3-D specs in their hands heading into the other shows? Theyre about to buckle into the FX-loaded noisy adolescent guy-tweaked ride that is the ""Transformers"" sequel. IMAX 3-D Wee-hah. This is of course a Mars versus Venus read on movie exhibition that often holds true. Younger Mars typically trumps the older Venus at the box office. This weekend is sure to prove that point. ""Larry Crowne"" doesnt come close to providing the rom-com satisfactions of films attached to the names Hanks and Roberts or writer Nia Vardalos for that matter. Nor does the PG-13 movie stoop to conquer with crass antics and ribaldry. Instead it makes for mildly pleasant night at the movies. Unless that is youre allergic to things described as ""nice."" If so youre gonna need a fast-acting antihistamine. ""Larry Crowne"" offers another example of how difficult it has become to strike the right tone of authenticity romance and contemporary life. Though Hanks directing his second feature tries mightily. This story unfolds amid unexpected layoffs underwater mortgages failed and faltering marriages. Yet it cant dampen its cockeyed optimism long enough to make us believe something real is at stake. Larry Crowne (Hanks) has enrolled in community college after losing his job at UMart where hed been a model employee. Teaching the sparsely attended introductory speech class is the well-coiffed very cranky Mrs. Tainot (Roberts). Hes as eager and open as they come. Not quite a bad teacher Mercy Tainot is less than present to her students. On the first day of class she underlines the word ""Care"" on the blackboard. You dont need an associates degree in psycho to know its not because her students need to give a durn but because she wants to. ""Breaking Bad"" Emmy winner Bryan Cranston plays her Internet-porn-surfing hubby. Larry tries to be hopeful. Mercy douses her frustration with margaritas. Can these opposite spirits click? Had co-writers Hanks and Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") shown chutzpah they might have thwarted this line of questioning. Just because theyre portrayed by movie stars doesnt mean Larry and Mercy belong together. And the stars chemistry feels decidedly platonic. Even so ""Larry Crowne"" is rife with appealing if contrived characters. Cedric the Entertainer plays Larrys neighbor Lamar. He dispenses wisdom from his lawn where he holds a never-ending yard sale. Colorado resident and 1970s genre-flick legend Pam Grier gives an underutilized but natural turn as Mercys friend and colleague Frances. George Takei plays Professor Matsutani an economics instructor with a dry mildly demented delivery. The real find is Gugu Mbatha-Raw (from the short- lived NBC series ""Undercovers""). Her character Talia and Larry meet cute. Both ride scooters. Talia and boyfriend Dell (Wilmer Valderrama doing amusing work as the not exactly jealous beau) lead a gang of scooter-riding friends. Talia is scripted to be a bit too footloose and bold. ""What do men see in irritatingly free spirits?"" grouses Mercy. But the British-born Mbatha-Raw has a magnetic quality.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 01 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA As producer director co-writer and star Tom Hanks has a lot of clout here and a good thing too. It takes tons of the stuff and an equal measure of arrogance to make a movie as formless and benignly vacuous as Larry Crowne. So to his impressive list of credits add the only one that matters culprit-in-chief. Movies Larry Crowne The official trailer The first frames offer a terrific sneak peek into that arrogance issue. Hanks believes so deeply in his innate likeability as a screen actor that it blinds him to what hes doing as a screenwriter. Just check out the opener. There we meet Larry clearly a relentlessly upbeat know-it-all employee-of-the-month type working at a Walmart-like store. As written Larry is damned annoying. But since the guy is played by Hanks he cant be annoying. He must be a likeable fellow. And when Larry gets canned in a typical corporate down-sizing manoeuvre he must be a sympathetic figure and a poignant reminder of a repressed economys random cruelty. Sorry but as the axe fell I could barely resist the urge to cheer. Right off then the firing scene backfires - theres just no earned drama. What follows is meant to be a romantic comedy yet guess what - no romance either and precious few laughs. Why? See above plus this exacerbating factor Tom Hanks the director. Way back in 1996 Hanks proved himself more than competent with his feature debut in That Thing You Do Now hes less than mediocre. Entire sequences plod by bereft of rhythm or pacing or any comic payoff. Oddly the emptiness also feels forced and manic like a sitcom without a situation. Not to worry though. The lucky director just has to shift himself from behind the camera to the front and presto hes a likeable commodity right? As for the amorous complications traditional in a romantic comedy the null-and-void theme continues There arent any. Larry decides to better himself by enrolling in East Valley Community College to major in Speech 217 The Art of Informal Remarks. Even as were swallowing our wonderment at the course title (and pondering Gertrude Steins famous dictum ""Remarks are not literature"") good apple Larry is taking a shine to his professor. Thats Mercedes allegedly a burnt-out case with a drinking problem but not so anyone would notice - certainly not Julia Roberts whose only real job here is to rapidly make the prof as thoroughly likeable as you-know-who. So dont fret over the booze - its not a complication. Neither is the fact that Mercedes is married since hubby is both a failed novelist and a hugely successful surfer of Internet porn. Expect his immediate removal which pretty much paves the way for amour and were barely into the second act. Luckily Larry has classmates. Like Talia who invites him and his vintage Yamaha scooter to scoot in her ""Scooter Gang."" Thats fun almost as much as watching her do a makeover on Larry. A trendy haircut spiffy jeans and some very colourful scarves give birth to a brand-new man. Yikes at this point Hanks is so likeable it hurts. Of course further amusement can be had by simply listening to the speeches in Speech 217 with ""How to Prepare Restaurant-Quality French Toast"" high on my list of favourites. Scintillating too is the dialogue which courtesy of a writerly assist from Nia Vardalos includes this exchange. ""Youre a great teacher"" says the student. ""Youre a great student"" says the teacher. Admittedly those remarks do sound a tad formal but theres no denying the artistry. Forgive me. I dwell ungenerously on the thorns in Larry Crowne. There is a rose the kiss that comes at long last when Hanks and Roberts finally pucker up. Oops forgive me again because even the climactic buss rates just another lacklustre grade in this sea of C-minuses. Next semester the stars should drop Speech 217 and enroll in Chemistry 101 - they dearly need some.

Julia Roberts plays one of his instructors. By Peter Rainer Film critic July 1 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Julia Roberts left and Tom Hanks are shown in a scene from ""Larry Crowne."" Bruce Talamon/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Tom Hanks has an affinity for playing affable ordinary guys which I guess makes him the Jimmy Stewart of his generation. Stewart however had a dual career playing characters - in ""Vertigo"" above all - stretched to the edge of doom. Hanks has been far less willing to tempt the dark side. If his new film ""Larry Crowne"" is any indication affability is still his calling card.He plays the eponymous title character a popular employee at a big-box retailer who is unaccountably laid off because he lacks a college degree. Dazed but resourceful he enrolls in a local junior college where his course work includes an economics class and a course in ""the art of informal remarks."" Its not clear how taking a couple of classes in a junior college is going to help a 50-plus man get a job but let that pass.The economics teacher played with straight-faced hilarity by George Takei is a martinet who confiscates Larrys cellphone. The other instructor Mercedes is played by Julia Roberts with a sashaying cynicism that almost matches Cameron Diazs in ""Bad Teacher."" This sort of thing must be in the air. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Larry supports himself in a diner as a short-order cook something he knows about from 20 years in the Navy after graduating high school. (Were supposed to feel good about the fact that Larry didnt go to college because he was too busy serving his country.) He also joins a biker club - biker gang would be stretching it - at the flirty behest of Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a classmate who revamps his dingy wardrobe and dubs him ""Lance Corona."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Larry is boringly practical. He uses the economics class to plot his financial future. Faced with Talias coy innocence he acts coyly innocent. The real romance is supposed to be between Larry and Mercedes whose husband (Bryan Cranston) a porn-obsessed layabout makes it conveniently easy for her to stray.Hanks and Roberts costarred once before in ""Charlie Wilsons War"" and once again they generate surprisingly little chemistry. Roberts isnt bad here but shes playing a character who by all evidence just wants to be left alone. Her fitful attraction to the gentlemanly Larry seems like a short-order romance cooked up by the filmmakers.Hanks who also directed co-wrote the script with Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") which may explain why the romantic angle seems shoehorned into a plot that could easily have done without it. Its enough that these two castaways are friends but I guess friendship doesnt cut it when youre trying to create a star-driven hit. It should though. Better a believable friendship than an unbelievable love affair. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual content.)

By John Anderson July 1 2011 Tom Hanks may not be Americas finest screen actor but hes got statuettes that say otherwise. When he won his back-to-back Best Actor Oscars in 1994 and 1995 for ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"" respectively he became the first actor to do so since Spencer Tracy (in 1937 and 1938) who was always considered the gold standard of classic Hollywood. Mr. Hanks has been compared repeatedly to James Stewart over the course of his three-decade career. Hes a distant relative of Abraham Lincolns mother; he fought long and hard to get a World War II memorial built on the Mall in Washington D.C.; if he were running for something it would be National Treasure. But as difficult as it is to dislike Mr. Hanks it takes no effort to all to develop an aversion toward ""Larry Crowne"" the alleged comedy being perpetrated today by Mr. Hanks; his director Mr. Hanks; his producer Mr. Hanks; and the co-writer Mr. Hanks. It is a distinctly painful experience On one level the story pushes all the Recession-Era buttons--Larry (Mr. Hanks) has been laid off from his managers job at a Wal-Mart-style budget store because he never went to college and he never went to college because he joined the Navy. That the film opens the same week as ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" could only have been a marketing calculation ""Larry"" being intended as the perfect counterprogramming to Hollywoods most callous exercise in soulless commerce. But so little effort has been exerted toward making ""Larry Crowne"" more than a class-warfare cartoon that the film generates its own sense of cynicism and the distinct sense that ""Larry Crowne"" is simply a sop to certain disgruntled theatergoers. Some may see it as a movie that strives to restore emotional warmth and simple human values to a medium that could certainly use a little more of both. But unlike the freshly matriculated Larry himself ""Larry Crowne"" gets a flunking grade in every discipline. Reuniting Mr. Hanks and Julia Roberts for the first time since the grossly underappreciated ""Charlie Wilsons War"" this is the first feature film directed by Mr. Hanks since ""That Thing You Do"" (1996) and establishes Larry immediately as the quintessential U.S. worker Hes enthusiastic hardworking honest cheerful and we have to guess trustworthy brave clean and reverent. Hes the antithesis of the very corporatized ethos that cuts him loose so brutally and nonsensically--since his educational shortcomings mean he cant advance in the company he must therefore be let go. It turns out to be a blessing of course Larry goes to community college where hes introduced to modern America the comic basso profundo of his weirdly disassociated economics professor Dr. Matsutani (""Star Trek"" vet George Takei) and Mercedes Tainot (Ms. Roberts) a leggy professor so weary and disillusioned she seems capable of extinguishing the spark of even the most eager knowledge-hungry student. But not of course Larry Crowne. The script by Mr. Hanks and Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") is one of those wonders of the cinema You wonder who thought any of this was funny. The fractious scenes between Mercedes and her stay-at-home husband (Bryan Cranston) are painful although they do give Larry the opportunity to provide a romantic palliative. Larrys adoption by a group of younger students--all of whom ride eco-friendly motor scooters--is cloyingly comically clueless; Gugu Mbatha-Raw who plays Larrys style tutor Talia is positively adorable but as directed by Mr. Hanks seems to be auditioning for her own Disney Channel program. The direction is generally awkward and given the coarsely written role Ms. Roberts is assigned to play the burden of charm is placed squarely on Mr. Hanks well-intentioned but sagging shoulders. Even a national monument will collapse under too much pressure. Watch a clip of Paramount Pictures ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"". Transformers Dark of the Moon A black hole of technology talent and time ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is a symptom of many things chief among them the fact that summer blockbuster movies dont really matter anymore. What matters is the propaganda. The sound and fury surrounding director Michael Bays third Hasbro-inspired sci-fi hallucination has been cranked up to such a volume that no consumer of any media can ignore it and no mere movie can possibly live up to it. And it doesnt matter Audiences wont come to ""Dark of the Moon"" to see it but to have seen it. The hype has outpaced the product. None of which is to say that ""Dark of the Moon"" isnt also a genuinely bad movie. Special effects god love them are intended to bridge the plausible and the fantastic. Yet at virtually no time amid the clinking clanking clattering collection of caliginous junk that rattles through ""Dark of the Moon"" is there the sense that such a gap has been spanned. Certainly there are well-defined worlds created by Mr. Bay and his scores of highly skilled craftsmen and other high-profile personnel (including the prolific producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and executive producer Steven Spielberg). These include the quasihuman reality of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) the unemployed college grad who cant get a job because he cant tell anyone that hes saved the world two times before. Parallel to Sam is the world of Sams intergalactic allies the mechanically mutating Autobots and their foes the Decepticons who some time earlier destroyed the planet Cybertron and will proceed to do the same to Washington and Chicago. Adjacent to these disparate universes is the world of erstwhile Victorias Secret employee Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who plays Sams girlfriend Carly and represents a species that may have originated on the planet Supermodeltron. And of course theres the action--the gleeful wholesale wanton relentless destruction that reduces entire U.S. cities to smoldering ruins and like Nascar sings the siren song of the morbidly amused. There is however no integration of these various elements no sense of immersion in consolidated fantasy and hence no suspension of disbelief. Hence no emotional engagement. Hence boredom. At 157 minutes ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" isnt just a movie. Its a sentence. ENLARGE The Autobot Bumblebee in Transformers Dark of the Moon. Paramount Pictures Dragooned into the service of this film are not merely the living but the dead. The conceit not a bad one is that the entire NASA space program was established to get to the moon and investigate the crash of an alien spacecraft in 1961 John F. Kennedy disinterred via Mr. Bays computer announces the effort; Richard Nixon similarly resurrected continues it. (The real-life Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin even shows up giving a rather sad validation to the entire enterprise.) What crashed on the moon those years before was a ship carrying the Cybertronian poobah Sentinal Prime (voice of Leonard Nimoy fittingly enough) and the key to world domination. What ensues or re-ensues is a battle led by the series principal Autobot Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) who will go metal-to-metal with the head Decepticon Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) furthering the ongoing effort to enslave the earth and establish a New Cybertron. Its all so very engaging. And unlike a good story requires too much detail in the telling. Theres barely a spark of humanity in ""Dark of the Moon"" although there are scattered about some very entertaining contributions made by actors not normally associated with alien space epics John Turturro repeating his role as the unctuous Agent Simmons is having his own fine time of it; John Malkovich used sparingly is delightful too. Ms. Huntington-Whitely making her first movie acquits herself admirably enough. You hate to point out how mechanical they are but the worst actors are the robots. One sounds like Bob Hoskins one sounds like the janitor on ""The Simpsons"" and Optimus Prime should he ever retire from the rubble could have a shining future narrating NFL highlight films. ENLARGE Jacob Wysocki as another title character this time in Terri. ATO Terri The disarming original ""Terri"" is a wry low-key comedy from director Azazel Jacobs (""Mommas Man"") that constantly monkeys with our expectations. An overweight loner a goofy sidekick the school siren--you can write the script yourself all about an insecure teenager adrift in a sea of adolescent anguish blahblahblah. And yet thats not quite what happens. Its true that Terri (the terrific touching Jacob Wysocki) has some not-quite-standard-issue problems including a demented uncle (Creed Bratton) absentee parents and a propensity to wear pajamas to school. But Terri also has a sense of himself that belies all the assumptions we make about kids in movies or for that matter kids. He knows hes strange but if someone doesnt like him he assumes its their problem. Hes also generous with his affections When a classmate (Olivia Crocicchia) gets caught in a rather public and compromising position Terri comes to her rescue. The other delight is John C. Reilly who as Terris attentive school principal may finally have found the perfect role for his peculiar and often misdirected gifts. The Perfect Host The less one knows about this perverse thriller from debuting director Nick Tomnay the better; a full appreciation of its delights lies in its revelations. Still it should be noted that baggage can be an advantage David Hyde Pierce who has proven his versatility and range in a number of Broadway successes remains for many that persnickety noodge of TVs ""Frasier"" Niles Crane. And having Niles in your head only makes Mr. Pierces performance as Warwick Wilson richer--a virtuouso turn that requires at least two personalities maybe more. Preparing dinner for an intimate group at his home in the Hollywood Hills Warwick is intruded upon by a fugitive bank robber named John Taylor played by Clayne Crawford who imbues his character with memorably authentic--and psychopathic--desperation. DVD FOCUS Charlie Wilsons War (2007) Its all about timing and the timing was all wrong for this first pairing of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Based on a book by George Crile the often hilarious political comedy had a script by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") was directed by Mike Nichols and co-starred Philip Seymour Hoffman (in a flat-out funny performance as a dyspeptic CIA agent). But the subject matter was too volatile In the 1980s the real-life Congressman Wilson had pushed U.S. efforts to aid the same anti-Soviet Afghan rebels who eventually morphed into the Taliban. All of which was bad box-office juju in 2007 and everyone more or less ran away from the movie. But it remains a gem ripe for rediscovery. The War of the Roses (1989) Danny DeVito directed this bleak black comedy starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner about a divorce so harrowing the film might have served as couples therapy. When they decide to part both Barbara Rose (Ms. Turner) and her husband Oliver (Mr. Douglas) decide to keep the house and each begins a campaign to force the other out. How far will they go? The teaser for the movie ""Once in a lifetime comes a motion picture that makes you feel like falling in love all over again. This is not that movie."" The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1968) Paul Newman is the incorrigible U.S. Army private who allows himself to be captured by the Italians during World War II so he can free five captured Allied military bigwigs (French British and American). All the POWs are one-star generals who refuse to take orders from each other; Harry is given two stars so he can wrangle the brass to freedom. Inevitably Harry gets involved with the Italian countess who owns the castle where theyre all being held but he still wins the war. ""Harry"" is perhaps more curiosity than classic but its hard not to be charmed by Mr. Newman. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Starring Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Director Tom Hanks Release Opened Jul 1 2011  Editorial Review Taking a familiar ride back to schoolBy Michael OSullivanFriday July 1 2011The tale of a broke unemployed and under-educated nebbish who transforms himself into a prince of a guy who finds his princess -- with the help of a scooter-riding fairy godmother and a cache of hip vintage threads -- ""Larry Crowne"" is a Cinderfella story for tough times. Its a light and breezy recession-themed romantic comedy; ""Up in the Air"" without all the angst and introspection.Tom Hanks (who also directed) plays the title character a squeaky-clean divorced man whos fired from his job as a salesman at a big-box store. (In this economy someones got to go and Larry doesnt have a college degree.)Without so much as pausing to feel sorry for himself Larry dumps his house -- he was underwater on the mortgage anyway -- switches from a gas-guzzling SUV to a more sensible if sexier second-hand scooter takes a part-time job as a short order cook and enrolls in college.His first course? A speech class called ""The Art of Informal Remarks."" Talk about unmarketable. At least the teacher -- played by an unhappily married and almost perpetually scowling Julia Roberts -- is hot.Key words here ""unhappily married"" and ""hot."" This is after all a romantic comedy. You can see whats coming even if Larry cant. Hanks plays his character with a slightly dazed deer-in-the-headlights grin. His outlook is an even more upbeat variant of Alfred E. Neumans ""What me worry?"" Larrys own naive catchphrase -- ""spectacular"" pronounced ""speck-tack-a-ler"" -- is telling.As for Robertss scowling the actress seems to have Botoxed her famous smile into submission for the first two-thirds of the film. Making Larry and the audience wait an hour before we see the whites of her teeth is a major miscalculation. When she and Larry finally kiss its hard to see why anyone would want to. But the script (co-written by Hanks and Nia ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" Vardalos) demands it.To compensate for the foolishness of taking a class in public speaking the script also has Larry sign up for Introductory Economics taught by an amusingly unhinged George Takei of ""Star Trek"" fame.Its in that econ class that Larry meets the free-spirited Talia (a delightful Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Like Larry shes a scooter rider and introduces him to her circle of scooter-aficionado college pals. Before you can say ""bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"" Talia has given Larry a magical makeover complete with new hair new glasses new tude and stylin clothes. Watching Hankss transformation from Larry Crowne to ""Lance Corona"" -- Talias nickname for his new persona -- is the films chief pleasure.But as romantic comedies go ""Larry Crowne"" is neither swooningly romantic nor howlingly funny. The films biggest laugh comes when Robertss character asks one of her students snarkily ""Are you clairvoyant?"" and he answers ""No Steve Dibiasi."" All thats missing is the rimshot.The film is comfortably familiar. Like the scooter gang thats central to the films plot -- and Larrys metamorphosis -- ""Larry Crowne"" putters down the middle of the road with its helmet strapped on tight.

Photo Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts come together for a romantic comedy about how the hard knocks from todays recession inspire one everyday guy to undergo a personal reinvention. ( ) Its been quite a few years since weve seen a vehicle for a pair of Oscar winners -- Hollywood prom king and queen Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts -- as disarmingly modest as ""Larry Crowne"" a romantic comedy about a newly downsized cook and the unhappily married community college teacher who changes his life. I really wasnt expecting much from Hanks belated second feature as a director -- after 1996s ""That Thing You Do"" And the fact that he wrote the script in collaboration with Nia Vardalos (Hanks and his wife produced her lucrative ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") did not inspire huge confidence going in. While this Capra-esque fable certainly has its schmaltzy aspects it does lightly engage social issues that star-driven Hollywood movies generally go to great lengths to avoid -- i.e. the Great Recession -- and in ways that reflect more of a recognizable reality than were used to seeing on the screen. Hanks has the title role as a 20-year Navy veteran whos stunned when hes abruptly sent packing by the Southern California superstore where hes long been the employee of the month. The legal excuse offered is that because Larry doesnt have a college degree he cant advance further in the company. Another guy might sue for age discrimination. But the divorced Larry sucks it up abandons his over-mortgaged house replaces his gas-guzzling SUV with a used motor scooter he buys from a neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer) and goes back to school. The scooter attracts the interest of a hot young student (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Interested on a strictly platonic level she recruits him for a group of riders decorates his new apartment and updates his wardrobe. The guileless Larry who takes a job as a short-order cook becomes intrigued by his sexy public-speaking teacher who is going through her own midlife crisis. Married to an unemployed Internet porn addict (Bryan Cranston) shes been showing up with hangovers for the 8 a.m. class with Hanks. Even in ""Charlie Wilsons War"" -- in which Roberts had a glorified supporting role -- it was clear she had terrific chemistry with Hanks. This is much rarer than youd think in contemporary Hollywood movies and something that shouldnt be undervalued. Hanks may not be the flashiest director but he has a far better idea of how to stage a scene than many helmers working today (see ""Bad Teacher"" or better dont). ""Larry Crowne"" isnt for anyone looking for edgy entertainment or with a low tolerance for the comic stylings of George Takei (hilarious as an economics professor) or Wilmer Valderrama (as the hot chicks boyfriend). But if youre looking for a movie you can take your parents or young children to without fear of embarrassment or the need for endless explanations this is the one. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next All My Children finale to air Sept. 23 Read Next All My Children finale to air Sept. 23 Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 31723 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 27400 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 16608 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Lackluster comedy in the Larry Crowne script - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Lackluster comedy in the Larry Crowne script By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Larry Crowne is both a dated lackluster comedy and a genial old-fashioned romance. By Bruce Talamon Universal Pictures Odd couple Julia Roberts and Tom Hank join the moped crowd in Larry Crowne. EnlargeClose By Bruce Talamon Universal Pictures Odd couple Julia Roberts and Tom Hank join the moped crowd in Larry Crowne. Though its lack of raunch and violence is commendable and there is a relaxed warmth to some scenes others fall resoundingly flat. The warmth can be attributed to Tom Hanks presence but the leaden jokes feel like pure Nia Vardalos who co-wrote the script with Hanks. After her broadly appealing My Big Fat Greek Wedding Vardalos lost her stride penning little-seen clunkers such as 2009s My Life in Ruins. Playing an affable Everyman Hanks has a rare talent for improving ordinary material with his inherent likability. He plays Larry a divorced Navy vet suddenly fired after many years on the job at a big-box store. He heads to a community college to start over selling his house and most of whats in it -- aided by next-door neighbors (Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson) who host daily yard sales. The banter between Cedric and Hanks provides the movies most genuine laughs. Larry also ditches his SUV in favor of a pastel-colored moped which grabs the attention of lively coed Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The scooter ""gang"" Talia travels with is about as believable as the Jets in West Side Story. Though he is a couple of decades older Larry is taken into their slow-moving fold. This subplot is the most forced especially Larrys cringe-inducing makeover. Larry enrolls in three classes including economics taught by George Takei (Star Trek) and speech. Julia Roberts plays Mercedes a public-speaking professor who has lost her passion at home and in the classroom. She doesnt appear to teach the subject as much as sit and smirk. Only drinking margaritas brings a bona fide smile to her face. Mercedes is married to a surly writer (Bryan Cranston) who spends much of his days ogling Internet porn. About the movie Larry Crowne  1/2 out of fourStars Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Gugu Mbatha-Raw Cedric the Entertainer Bryan Cranston George Takei Taraji P. Henson Wilmer Valderrama Pam Grier Director Tom Hanks Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual content Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Hanks and Roberts have an easy chemistry but isnt it far-fetched for the striking intellectual Mercedes to take up with Larry one of her adult students whose job is now flipping burgers? Chronicling an ordinary guy who reinvents himself is a noble idea as is filling the tale with a culturally diverse cast. But even set in an era where layoffs are sadly common it lacks cultural currency. In his second filmmaking venture (after 1996s That Thing You Do) Hanks directs with assurance. Perhaps if he had teamed with a more agile writer less given to cheesy yuck-fests Larry Crowne would be the nuanced adult love story it aims to be.

Photo Bruce Talamon AP Larry Crowne review College changes everything 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Larry Crowne Romantic comedy. Starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts left. Directed by Tom Hanks. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Spending 99 minutes in the company of Tom Hanks is never difficult and its easy to appreciate the ambition behind ""Larry Crowne"" and take some pleasure in that. The story of a nice guy who gets downsized - hes a veteran no less - the movie tries to distill a number of currents in modern-day American life including the recession and the housing crisis. The results are mixed but throughout there are moments of recognition. Hanks as a writer-director is talking about real things even if he isnt depicting them with complete honesty. Still if you want to really like ""Larry Crowne"" instead of just like it a little dont think of it as a Hanks movie. Think of it as a Julia Roberts movie because as a vehicle for Roberts ""Larry Crowne"" has a lot to recommend it. She plays a community college professor whose life is heading into complete professional and spiritual burnout and thats exactly how she plays it. Its a portrait in disgust and exhaustion teetering on the edge of hopelessness and the humor she brings to it is the humor of an appealingly cynical person with enough distance to marvel at how her life has gone off the rails. To see Roberts in ""Larry Crowne"" - and in recent movies good and bad such as ""Eat Pray Love"" ""Valentines Day"" ""Duplicity"" - is to see an actress bringing much more to the table in her 40s than she ever did as a young woman. She has several scenes in which she has to argue with her husband an author turned blogger turned Internet porn addict and her weariness is so lived-in and so complete that we get the whole history. Related Stories Larry Crowne When Roberts does smile these days its not the smile of someone who has been told too many times about her smile that she confers it only as a benediction. Its the smile of someone dazzled by absurdity. Shes not smiling at us anymore but for us. In ""Larry Crowne"" the title character (Hanks of course) finds himself middle-aged and broke with a big mortgage and no prospects and so he enrolls in community college hoping a degree will help. Hanks wrote the script with Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") and he gets credit for making a movie about whats going on. Alas it plays like something written by people who only heard whats going on but dont really know. Larry is a working-class guy - he had a job at U-Mart (read Walmart) - and yet the movie has him living in a house that must be 3000 square feet. Later he takes a small apartment and is able to support himself as a part-time short-order cook. Diners must be paying a lot these days. When Larry goes to college he is befriended - embraced really - by a group of twentysomethings who make him part of their posse. It doesnt ring true. And what can we say for Larrys life plan? There are kids graduating from Stanford who cant get a job in this economy. So how is being 50 with a community college degree going to make Larry irresistible to employers? Imagine if Hanks made a movie in which the protagonist had a debilitating stroke. And then imagine this afflicted character swallowing an aspirin and suddenly getting better. For such a film should Hanks be congratulated for bringing up a serious health issue or criticized for introducing it only to trivialize its gravity? Thats the situation here. ""Larry Crowne"" is a movie about having no money by people who genuinely sympathize but dont have a clue. Still its Tom Hanks. Its Julia Roberts. Theyre kissing. George Takei is in it loving the sound of his own voice - thats OK we love it too - and Pam Grier shows up in a small part as usual making a movie a little bit better just by being there. I had a migraine when I started watching ""Larry Crowne"" and by the end it went away. None of this quite adds up to a recommendation but its close. Very close. -- Advisory Strong language.

"Larry Crowne review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Hanks for nothing Larry CrowneOne star for tone-deaf look at economic realitiesJuly 01 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJulia Roberts and Tom Hanks in ""Larry Crowne.""The best romantic comedies have a blithe take-it-or-leave-it spirit. ""Larry Crowne"" has the opposite. Its the neediest movie of 2011 and one of the phoniest.Set in an American middle class only vaguely like the real one ""Larry Crowne"" co-stars Julia Roberts as a community college instructor of public speaking and English (I think; the script is vague) who rivals the Cameron Diaz layabout in ""Bad Teacher"" in aggressive slackerdom. The main star though is the co-producer co-writer and director Tom Hanks who has made all sorts of potential dullards on screen worth watching. So why does ""Larry Crowne"" go flooey?Co-scripted by Nia Vardalos (whose monster hit ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was produced by Hanks) the project grew out of Hanks story notion of a decent middle-age man thrown for a loop by economic circumstance and returning to community college to begin a new life. This is a fine idea for a screenplay; anyone who has attended (or taught in) community colleges knows the diversity of most student bodies goes every which way ethnically socioeconomically generationally.But straight off its clear Larry serves as a flat emblem of a situation rather than an interesting character in a situation. A recently divorced financially strapped Navy veteran with an underwater mortgage hes laid off from his team leader position at the local U-Mart big-box store. Reason? A wobbly one Hes told he lacks the college degree required for management positions.So its back to school somewhere in the Valley region of LA. When we first meet Larry hes in his comfort zone as a back-slapping hail-fellow hunk of niceness at the U-Mart. Yet in his first public-speaking attempt in class hes a different man stilted and tongue-tied bearing no resemblance to the Larry of the earlier scenes. This isnt complexity; its just inconsistency.The borderline alcoholic played by Roberts whose character is married to a porn addict (Bryan Cranston) has given up all hope in her romantic life and her career. Larry represents hope and resilience and Nice Guys Finish First. Scooter-driving Larrys fellow students who include a dishy scooter enthusiast played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw barely register as comic stereotypes let alone something richer. Most films make no bones about where theyre going and how theyre going to get there. ""Larry Crowne"" whose screenplay is too close to the quality level of Vardalos recent ""I Hate Valentines Day"" for comfort offers zero surprises but -- fatally -- no wit and only the thinnest sort of synthetic charm. Bleached of any real-world emotional wrinkles Hanks character coasts on the actors world-class likability. Larrys neighbors played by Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson are generic in the extreme which becomes the paradox of the film itself How can a generic product provoke such resistance?Had Hanks directed two unknowns in the leads rather than himself and Roberts its possible ""Larry Crowne"" wouldnt carry the same air of A-list slumming. Yet I wonder. I like these two both as actors and as movie stars. I doubt this script could be salvaged by any actor any director. I laughed when Roberts hung-over hacked-off educator underlines a word on her classroom chalkboard and cant quite hang on to the chalk long enough to finish the job. That bit I liked Its the films sole glimmer of take-it-or-leave-it.mjphillipstribune.comLarry Crowne -- 1 starMPAA rating PG-13 (brief strong language and some sexual content)Cast Tom Hanks (Larry Crowne); Julia Roberts (Mercedes Tainot); Bryan Cranston (Dean Tainot); Cedric the Entertainer (Lamar); Taraji P.

"Larry Crowne Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie Review Larry CrowneThis story of an ordinary guys Pygmalion-like midlife makeover may sound promising but in Tom Hanks hands its not. And Julia Roberts doesnt fare much better.July 01 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks in ""Larry Crowne."" (Bruce Talamon / Universal...)""Larry Crowne"" is an inside-out movie acceptable around the edges but hollow and shockingly unconvincing at its core. When that core is two of the biggest movie stars around a Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts a its an especially dispiriting situation. Hanks and Roberts topline this adult romantic comedy about supposedly real people the kind of movie that would be welcome were it not doomed by its tone of hopelessly contrived Hollywood sincerity. Hanks who also directed and co-wrote with Nia Vardalos (responsible for the cloying ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") has done himself no favors here. Though this story of an ordinary guys ""Pygmalion""-type makeover after a midlife crisis may sound like it has potential it plays more like a double-barreled vanity project than anything worth seeing. Which is a shame because Hanks is one of the few stars actually capable of playing ordinary. But saddled with a self-inflicted script that presents a character as chipper and gee whiz as Forrest Gump Hanks attempts at creating empathy invariably go astray. Hanks Larry Crowne is introduced as the ultimate company man an enthusiastic employee of U-Mart whos so devoted to his big-box store job that he cheerfully picks up trash in the parking lot on the way in to work. In years past the U-Mart nation had recognized Crownes ardor with numerous employee of the month awards but not today. Today our hero who joined the Navy right out of high school gets terminated because he doesnt have a college degree. That means he cant be promoted and that lack of opportunity is not the U-Mart way. Or something. Even in the scene where Crowne gets fired the bit players on-screen are more involving than he is and this trend continues with the introduction of neighbors and professional yard-sale merchants Lamar (Cedric the Entertainer) and BElla (Taraji P. Henson). Lamar convinces Crowne that he needs an education to be ""fire proof"" so Crowne buys a fuel-efficient scooter and putt-putts off to East Valley Community College (Cal State Dominguez Hills is the actual location) to meet his destiny. In the scooter parking lot Crowne pulls in next to fetching free spirit Talia (engaging British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a genial take-charge type who tells him he dresses too much like an ex-cop and introduces him to a ""gang"" of fellow scooter enthusiasts including boyfriend Dell (Wilmer Valderrama). Its a good thing that ""Larry Crowne"" is able to cast these and other peripheral characters so well (the veteran Jeanne McCarthy did the honors) because its right about now that Crowne connects with faculty member Mercedes Tainot (Roberts) whos reluctantly teaching a course in informal public speaking. Offering classes no one appreciates and trapped in a marriage with a writer (Bryan Cranston) who says hes establishing a beachhead in the new media though hes actually surfing the Internet for porn Tainot is unhappy in her life and doesnt care who knows it. Though nothing about her performance is inspired Roberts is most convincing when she treats Crowne and his fellow students with haughty disdain. Because even this movie knows that a Forrest Gump/Pretty Woman romantic pairing is not going to fly ""Larry Crowne"" spends much of its time detailing the changes Crownes new scooter-riding friends make in his appearance and personality. Changes we are led to believe that will lead to the blinding realization that you Larry Crowne are as Talia says ""way cooler than you appear."" Its all for naught because ""Larry Crownes"" love connection between student and teacher is one of the most unconvincing in memory. Not only is the on-screen chemistry between Hanks and Roberts less than zero the films feckless script cant be bothered to come up with a scenario for their getting together thats even a fraction as plausible as Tainots initial scorn. When we last see these lovebirds they are perched on Crownes scooter waving patronizingly to the wretched peons in the audience an act of self-satisfied movie star hauteur that would do credit to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. If this is the best Hollywood can muster for adult audiences were in for a long hard summer. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESScooter sales surge after two-year slumpJune 30 2011Dress-up in Tarajis closetJuly 25 2010{The End Game}September 10 2000Summer Sports Notebook / Steve Henson  No One Can Accuse...July 21 1988MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentTaraji P HensonTaraji P.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Tom Hanks is killing time in ""Larry Crowne"" an adult romance that is heartwarming uplifting and monumentally dull. The picture is designed to charm people and it does so by mechanical means eccentric characters repetitive visual gags and performances dusted with so much comic sparkle you could die from the twinkling. Hanks plays the title character a good-Joe naval veteran abruptly fired from his job at a big-box store because he lacks a college degree. The film seems as if it is onto something in a scene where Hanks pleads with his patronizing bosses eyes welling. The setup is the only moment of real dramatic complication in the film however. No sooner is Larry cut loose than we enter a magical world where one kiss causes a couple to fall in love and one semester of introductory economics sets a floundering job seeker on a path of economic independence. In the world of ""Larry Crowne"" all it takes to triumph over downsizing is a positive attitude; the script exists merely to steer the film to the next easy laugh. Larry enters the local community college where all the students are fun-loving ding-alings; develops a tame crush on his teacher (Julia Roberts) and gets his mojo back. This is basically a male makeover movie. Larry regains his confidence by getting a new haircut a more flattering wardrobe and a redecorated home thanks to Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a dazzling coed who becomes his guardian angel. Why she would take on dowdy Larry as her fixer-upper project and phone-texting best buddy is never explained. It is as big a mystery as why Hanks cast himself in a bland passive role that would not strain the talents of Tim Allen. LARRY CROWNE  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual content. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings Larry is less a character than a concept a generic Joe Average learning to cope with a recession-shrunk American dream. Were told that he has been through a ""blood bath"" in a recent divorce but we see no trace of his ex and no emotional scars on his ever-upbeat personality. Its hard to imagine a true Californian smiling through the indignity of trading down from a mastodon-sized SUV to an aged scooter but our Larry grins like a kid on his first merry-go-round. Only Roberts gets a scrap of back story in scenes with her layabout husband (Bryan Cranston) an out-of-work writer whose taste for adult websites drives her to make gigantic blender cocktails. Emotional friction makes its one and only appearance in a scene where they get tipsy enough to lay into each other. The only quality that gives the film any distinction is the cast. The most amazing people keep turning up. Blaxploitation queen Pam Grier and ""Star Treks"" George Takei play professors Wilmer Valderrama of ""That 70s Show"" plays Talias needlessly jealous boyfriend Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson play Larrys neighbors who operate a never-ending yard sale and former ""Daily Show"" correspondent Rob Riggle plays a smug suit who fires Larry but gets a magical comeuppance. Hanks hasnt always had a great nose for material (remember ""The Money Pit"" ""The Ladykillers"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities""?). This time though he has no one to blame but himself. Hanks directed this saccharine exercise in wish fulfillment and co-wrote it with Nia Vardalos (whose folksy smash ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" he produced in 2002). If he is vying for a late-career vocation as a Clint Eastwood-style jack of all trades he has a long way to go.

More about Larry Crowne >> Better than Michele Bachmann or Rand Paul President Obama or Ben Bernanke the man who won an Oscar for playing the fleet-footed simpleton Forrest Gump has figured out how to cope with unemployment underwater mortgages and rocketing prices at the pump. In Larry Crowne a recession-era romantic comedy in which Hanks takes on the title role and which he also directed and coscripted the almost-always-ingratiating star plays an impossibly nice middle-aged divorce who has to reinvent himself when he loses his job - as a sales clerk in a store that looks very much like a Wal-Mart. So how does he do it? By swapping out his gas-guzzler for a used Yamaha scooter walking away from the home he can no longer afford enrolling in community college and getting Julia Roberts to fall in love with him. Easy. Too cute for its own good Larry Crowne is nonetheless hard to dislike. Hanks who makes the transformation from an eager-beaver chain-store employee to a late-in-life college student with only a few face-quavering moments of angst along the way knows how to get audiences to like him. Its not even a conscious thing - like Jimmy Stewart before him Hanks can do American Everyman in his sleep earnest stalwart a little goofy perhaps but that just makes him all the more appealing. And Roberts who plays East Valley Community College professor Mercedes Tainot does that Julia Roberts thing she does She walks down hallways on amazing Julia Roberts legs curls her Julia Roberts lips in a sexy huff pops her Julia Roberts eyes wide open and turns on the high-beam Julia Roberts smile. Add a cast of supporting characters who all get their turn to crack wise and crank up the charm - Cedric the Entertainer Pam Grier Rami Malek George Takei and the criminally charismatic Gugu Mbatha-Raw - and you have a summer diversion that at least doesnt involve giant robots from outer space or misfit mutants plotting to nuke the planet. Larry Crowne like its unprepossessing name works on some kind of basic human scale. It may not be grounded in reality exactly but Hanks and Nia (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) Vardalos screenplay is still identifiable as emanating from a real place. (It would be instructive to put Larry Crowne and the similarly themed Everything Must Go on a double bill Like Hanks character Will Ferrells Nick Halsey loses his job and puts his possessions on the front lawn to sell but the latter film with its genuinely awkward painful moments and muted resolution feels a whole lot more honest. And its still funny.) So Larry who never went to college (a long stint in the Navy followed by a long stint at the U-Mart) gets made-over by Talia (Mbatha-Raw) a sunny spunky fellow student who IMs Larry and who tells him to untuck his polo shirt restyle his hair and get a man-bag. Cruising around town with Talia and her scooter crew Larry starts to see what he has been missing. And he starts to see his Speech 217 (The Art of Informal Remarks) instructress the doggedly unhappy Ms. Tainot. Shes married to a stay-at-home blogger and porn-surfer (Bryan Cranston) and so she spends her downtime downing drinks - until she finally dumps the deadbeat husband and finds herself on the back of Larrys old Yamaha. Only a good 45 minutes or so of wary misunderstanding and midterms stand between Larry and Mercedes eternal happiness. Cue Tom Petty and the Electric Light Orchestra. And be sure to follow Hanks strategic foreclosure advice. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

He turns his 20 years cooking for the Navy into a job at his buddys diner. At school he falls for his steely speech professor (Julia Roberts) and falls in with a multiracial gang of young scooter riders who commit such crimes of cuteness as makeovers and matchmaking. Larry discusses the glories of French toast wears a silk scarf to class and happily motors around the city with his new friends. Its ""Easy-Listening Rider.Hanks directed ""Larry Crowne and wrote the screenplay with his pal Nia Vardalos. Its the work of someone tired of scanning the show times seeing say ""Comic-Book Movie 7 and thinking golly there really is nothing out there for me. Hanks and Vardalos are taking on middle-aged multiplex starvation like its global warming. Some stars split themselves open to direct Something Important. To his credit Hanks isnt dancing with wolves or dragging Jim Caviezel to the Stations of the Cross (although his lighting is just this side of Streisand). He just wants to make another movie our grandmothers would see (the first was 1996s knowingly square 1960s rock-band comedy ""That Thing You Do). So when Pam Grier who plays one of Robertss fellow professors complains that Facebook and Twitter are ruining minds you can practically hear murmurs of approval. Blogs come in for a dis too.The movie isnt trying to tap into peoples economic concerns. It glosses over those. Vardaloss writing can be pleasingly broad and incisive as it was in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding and ""Connie and Carla. She knows how to fill a grown-up void with sentimentality and zaniness. But ""Larry Crowne isnt a movie for adults. Its a movie for adults who dont like things with screens and keyboards.Having George Takei confiscate cellphones during his economics law class is funny. But the head scooter urchin and Larrys classmate Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is an obnoxious feel-good idealization of youthful energy. She over-texts him (their conversation pops up on the screen). She gives him what she thinks is a cooler name (Lance Corona). She makes him buy better clothes (theyre vintage her favorite) flirts with him and causes adorable trouble with her leader-of-the-pack boyfriend (Wilmer Valderrama).The whole gang reeks of farmers market and craft beer. Theyre Alice Waters Muppets. When Roberts meets Talia she snipes ""What do men see in irritating free spirits? Yes thats rich coming from a woman who once played Tinkerbell. Still the line got a murmur of approval from me. Less time with the gang and more with Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson I say. They play Larrys yard-sale-fanatic neighbors. Its all a little ""Sanford and Son I know. But its as close to Redd Foxx as Cedrics comedy will ever come. Roberts is actually the best thing in the movie. She comes to class looking sour and hung-over. Her lines are delivered with a tang missing everywhere else in the movie. You wonder how much more interesting ""Bad Teacher would have been had conniving Cameron Diaz squared off against bitter Roberts who of course in ""Larry Crowne is Good Teacher. (The first word she writes on the board is ""care. Although when she does it the chalk breaks up and her emphasis comically peters out.)The smugness people say they dislike about Roberts is almost muscular here. Her snobbery and exasperation toward both her Neanderthal husband (Bryan Cranston) and her small and small-minded class are rigged in her favor but they work. Naturally the normal exceptionally average Larry will tame her nastiness and start her braying with joy. Hanks makes it all look so easy that theres no tension or wonder or fun. He clogs the soundtrack with lite guitar rock and is indifferent to matters of shot assembly.Conventionally ""Bad Teacher is a worse movie but Id rather watch that instead. It has a star luxuriating in her comfort zone. And despite its incoherence and viciousness and condescension it has snap and edge. Plus I think the kids actually learn something. ""Larry Crowne is no less condescending. Who knows what Professor Roberts instills in her adult students? Who knows why Larry says the word ""spectacular the way Tyler Perrys Madea might? The movie just feigns a kind of aw-shucks egalitarianism. Ultimately though no one here but Roberts is Hankss equal.In ""Punch Line from 1988 Hanks plays a moonlighting stand-up comedian. There was a wild manic need in that performance. He was acting out the please-love-me persona that now entombs him. In ""Larry Crowne that quest is redundant. Hanks is approved. Nonetheless he walks from scene to scene in a combined state of wonderment and confusion. Its as if Woody the Cowboy has awoken to find himself a 50-year-old divorce. Thats an earnest attempt at modesty that feels a tad false. Hanks keeps rearing his regality then apologizing for it. But its still a crown with the ""e or without.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Larry Crowne | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; larry-crowne ) Larry Crowne (United States 2011) June 30 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli A dozen years ago the prospect of a romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts - two of the most bankable actors of the late-90s and early-00s - would have created waves of anticipation. In 2011 this second collaboration between the two (they were previously paired in Charlie Wilsons War although not romantically) is having trouble generating ripples. Part of that is because it is being released as ""counterprogramming"" to Transformers 3. Another part is that this is intended for grown-ups and the summer season is not kind to such films. Finally some would argue (those who base their decisions solely on box office calculations) that both Hanks and Roberts are past their ""sell by"" date. This may be true but it doesnt stop Larry Crowne from being three things Transformers 3 is not light frothy and capable of being watched without generating a headache. The concept of a romantic comedy in which the leads are old enough to legally drink is something of a novelty these days. That wasnt always the case of course but the genre has gradually been perverted over the years to the point where not only are the stars in their teens but so are the expected members of the audience. One senses that group will avoid Larry Crowne like the plague - its too much like the gross-out consideration that their parents have sex. On the other hand those who appreciate the star quality and appeal of Hanks and Roberts may relish the opportunity to see what kind of chemistry these two can generate opposite one another. The spark is there and thats all actors of this caliber need to generate a little heat (although the result falls short of a conflagration). Larry Crowne should not be mistaken for a masterpiece. It is summer entertainment genial undemanding lightweight. But it has a heart offers winning performances from two genuine luminaries and (thank god) isnt available anywhere in 3-D. To experience Larry Crowne viewers will have to suffer through the indignities of paying less for a ticket being refused the chance to wear cheap plastic glasses and seeing every image clearly and brightly. And as obvious and predictable as this story might be it still works - in large part because we care about the human beings inhabiting this motion picture. In a nod to the harsh realities of today Larry Crowne opens with a layoff. Perennial Employee of the Month in a Walmart-type store Larry Crowne (Hanks) has been let go because he lacks a post-high school education. More bad news follows when he learns that his house is now worth less than his mortgage. Hes drowning in debt and theres no one to throw him a lifeline. So he gathers up the shreds of his dignity and enrolls in three courses at the local community college. One - a public speaking class - is taught by Mercedes Tainot (Roberts) who has become as disillusioned about her profession as she is about her dead-end marriage. It goes without saying that she and Larry will become attracted to one another and that their presence in each others lives will have beneficial effects. For Larry though theres another source of inspiration. A co-student in his Economics class (taught by a hilarious George Takei) Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) introduces him to a ""scooter posse"" (a group of students who commute to college on motor scooters). The openness and friendship of this group loosens Larry up so he can excel in Mrs. Tanoits course. Although the film follows the generally accepted arc of the traditional romantic comedy it thankfully avoids the pitfalls associated with artificial interpersonal conflict (something also known as ""romantic complications""). Larrys ex-wife doesnt suddenly want him back and Mercedes good-for-nothing husband doesnt undergo a personality transplant. The romantic aspect of Larry Crowne relates to two decent people tiptoeing their way into a relationship. This is part of a larger picture - Larry grabbing his runaway life by the horns and regaining control - but its by far the most important part. One disappointment is how bland and uninteresting most of the supporting characters are. Despite a relatively high billing Cedric the Entertainer has little more to do than play the ""helpful neighbor"" and throw out occasional one-liners. Hes irrelevant to the main thrust of the story and on hand to provide some background color. Ditto for the members of the motor scooter gang and the students in Mercedes class. Larry Crowne is not populated by a group of richly drawn engaging secondary personalities. Larry Crowne is co-written by Hanks and Nia Vardalos whose career is defined by the term ""one-hit wonder."" She struck pay dirt with her endearing 2002 sleeper My Big Fat Greek Wedding but has done nothing worthwhile since then. While its impossible to separate her contributions to the screenplay from Hanks she is not one to take chances or write with an edge; neither of these qualities are found in Larry Crowne. Like most romantic comedies this one is about wish fulfillment. In this case its the promise that there can be brighter days after losing a wife a job and a house. It is fair to argue that Larry Crowne isnt a lot smarter than the average summer movie but at least its quieter more sincere and mercifully shorter than most of its box office competition.

Comments click to enlarge Larry Crowne Video Rated PG-13  99 minutes  2011 Tom Hanks collaborated with Nia Vardalos on the screenplay for this middle-aged rom-com and it plays like one of her lonely-girl comedies (My Big Fat Greek Wedding My Life in Ruins I Hate Valentines Day) with the focus shifted to the male love interest. Hanks is a store manager who gets canned and enrolls in community college to earn a business degree and Julia Roberts takes the Vardalos role as the crabby professor who teaches him public speaking. Theres some cute stuff involving Hanks and some teenagers who tool around campus on scooters but an utter lack of chemistry between him and Roberts dooms the movie. Hanks directed; with Bryan Cranston Cedric the Entertainer Pam Grier George Takei and Rita Wilson. By J.R.

Larry Crowne Bad to fair Director Tom Hanks. Cast Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual content. This weeks new movie releases Teen movies Youre incorrect. Instead the movie which Hanks directs stars in and co-wrote with Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") falls flat playing like the best-cast bland romantic comedy youve ever seen. Its not charm-free exactly but it feels false coasting by on Hanks and Roberts easy appeal instead of earning its laughs - and its dramas. Hanks plays the title character who works in a big-box store. Hes an over- eager do-everything guy cleaning up trash from the parking lot on the way in to start his shift. And then one day his soulless bosses sit him down and break the bad news Hes done. Downsized. Fired. (As an example of the movies tone-deafness the scene is largely played for laughs.) Larry joined the Navy after high school and served 20 years never going to college; this prevents his rise up the company ladder (putting him behind even the dolt who grins and boasts ""Three years at Chico State""). Thanks for your service goodbye. Larry is crushed at least momentarily. He tries unsuccessfully to find work elsewhere. On the advice of his neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer) Larry enrolls in community college where he falls in with a gang of scooter-riding students. (Larry had bought a used scooter to save on gas money.) The effect on his life is immediate. In particular the free-spirited Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) changes him - his hair his clothes the layout of his home his attitude. Theres no hesitation on Larrys part no thinking it through. He goes along with everything and it all works. No false starts - the story has no use for them. Larry lands in a public-speaking class taught by Mercedes Tainot (Roberts). Shes nothing like Larry who remains an optimist at heart picking up a job as a cook in his friends restaurant. Mercedes whos cynical and unhappy - her author husband (Bryan Cranston) has devolved from published author to ""blogger"" which actually means porn surfer - drinks the day away after coasting through classes. And yet somehow she notices Larry (he certainly has noticed her) and one night after a drunken fight with her husband she kisses Larry who happened by the bus stop where she was sitting because that sort of thing is always happening in this film. They both know its a mistake but hope its not. Is it? Take a wild guess. These are characters with real problems problems affecting more and more people. Yet Hanks the director casts a warm glow over everything muting the impact of the characters trials. Im not saying this should be a deadly serious drama - thats not the movie Hanks was making. But his characters should have to work harder for their triumphs and they dont. This could have been a powerful movie as well as funny and yes charming. Instead it takes the easy way out and its poorer for it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Bruce Talamon Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks in ""Larry Crowne"" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Bruce Talamon) Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks) has often been employee of the month at the big-box retailer hes worked for since his stint in the Navy. So when the bosses call him in for a surprise meeting he assumes hell once again hear about the great job hes done.But instead of a pat on the back Larry gets a pink slip. Its devastating -- all the more so because hes in his 50s and his options are limited. What can he do now?Well theres always community college. And for Larry who makes friends easily that turns out to be a good move. Among his new acquaintances are a young hipster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who sees him as makeover material and an economics professor (George Takei) who doesnt tolerate cellphones in class. Larry also quickly develops a crush on Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts) who teaches a course in communication skills but has none-too-subtle anger issues. A guy like Larry may be just what Mercedes needs. But first he has to deal with issues of his own.""Larry Crowne"" is Hanks first outing as a feature director since ""That Thing You Do"" (1996). Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") Hanks delivers a likable and often hilarious film that doesnt pretend to offer profound insights about midlife romance or the state of the American economy. Its simply an opportunity to spend time with characters who may lack depth but are fun to watch. Hanks and Roberts generate more romantic chemistry than they did in their last collaboration ""Charlie Wilsons War"" (2007). And their comic interplay is spot-on. ""Larry Crowne"" proves that its possible to be funny without being crude. But more than that its as easygoing as the character for which its named.""Larry Crowne""Three stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 139  Content Brief strong language and some sexual content Entertainment Larry Crowne movie trailer Jun 30 2011 (...)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres little on the mind of Larry Crowne an almost proudly weightless romantic comedy directed by and starring Tom Hanks but that doesnt mean it will leave audiences without anything to think about. Above all the film offers a neat lesson in the pros and cons of movie stars whose presence can elevate even the slimmest material with sheer charisma then drag it back down when that charisma gets overtaxed. Hanks and co-star Julia Roberts are born stars--or at least extremely practiced ones--which serves them well here until it becomes apparent that the film has little going for it beyond their personal appeal. The story feels half-considered the relationships thin and the direction visually indifferent. (Those charges couldnt be leveled at Hanks previous directorial effort 1996s That Thing You Do) Its as if Hanks and co-writer Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) assumed that getting everyone in one place would be enough and didnt think much further. They should have. Hanks plays the title character a divorced Navy veteran and longtime employee of a Walmart-like chain whos fired because he never went to college thus cant advance any further in the company. Rather than filing what seemingly should be an extremely lucrative wrongful-dismissal suit Hanks follows the advice of the quirky next-door neighbors (Cedric The Entertainer Taraji P. Henson) and enrolls in a community college. There he strikes up a friendship with even-quirkier fellow student Gugu Mbatha-Raw who takes on the duties of a strictly platonic Manic Pixie Dream Girl giving Hanks a makeover enlisting him into her ""gang"" of moped enthusiasts and encouraging his interest in one of his teachers a bitter perpetually hungover English instructor played by Julia Roberts. Mbatha-Raws interest in Hanks life drives the action but the film itself keeps a curious distance from its characters. Hanks remains as effortlessly disarming as ever but beyond better opportunities at gainful employment the film never clarifies what he wants out of life in general or his relationship with Roberts in particular. Where his character feels undefined Roberts is painted in the broadest possible strokes We learn shes professionally disillusioned and in the final stages of a dying marriage to Bryan Cranston but little about who she is. She looks dour but occasionally bursts into the smile that made her famous and theres little to her character between those two extremes. A few of the supporting players have better luck Mbatha-Raw is charming Better Off Teds Malcolm Barrett has some nice moments as a goofy classmate and George Takei finds some of the films only real laughs as an eccentric econ professor. (Meanwhile a scene in which Cranston defends his porn-surfing habits by drunkenly barking ""I like big knockers"" seems destined to be on nobodys future highlight reel.) As a director Hanks allows his leads a couple of engaging relaxed moments together but they make the forced pleasantness around them that much more annoying. To be any flimsier Larry Crowne would have to be projected on Kleenex.

Im talking of course about the 1983 Yamaha Riva 180 scooter upon whose banana seat Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts perch like vibrant baby boomers who have just saved 15 percent on motorized-bike insurance. Well-loved Hanks and Roberts may be the human horsepower pulling in audiences for this middle-of-the-road recession-era Hollywood diversion. But when the credits roll after the predetermined happy ending all that is likely to remain in your memory is the retro cuteness of that four-stroke Riva 180 and the movies gang of even cooler Italian models into whose jaunty company the little scoot falls. Its always nice to get a visit from Tom and Julia (even if youre left wondering when the gentleman and lady became mature ambassadors from the land of gallant pre-Twitter celebrity). But just like the generic name of the title character they are too easily forgotten here. Following a high-saturation prerelease promotional campaign the premise of Larry Crowne is already known to millions Larry (Hanks) is fired from his worker-bee job at a big-box store on grounds that his lack of a college education has made him unpromotable. So he enrolls in community-college classes. (Never mind that the enthusiastic worker has been Employee of the Month nine times over and that hes got 20 years of U.S. Navy service behind him.) Anyhow -- and this is important -- for his college commute Larry garages his gas-guzzling SUV in favor of the aforementioned mini-wheels picked up at the permanent yard sale run by his zany neighbor (Cedric the Entertainer). In the way of the ever-so-faintly condescending upbeat big box of a script co-written by Hanks and My Big Fat Greek Weddings Nia Vardalos we learn random stuff that doesnt pay off Larry is divorced (with no kids) for unknown reasons from a phantom wife; hes carrying a hefty mortgage on his nice suburban house; he has a huge valuable collection of vinyl records; and his banker whose narrative job it is to explain to the audience the effect of our countrys current economic crisis on average folks like Larry is played by Rita Wilson Mr. Hanks likable actual wife. As it happens between the scooter and the inspirational American gumption to pick himself up and dust himself off life begins looking up for Larry. First the professor in his Welcome Back Kotter-like public speaking class turns out to be Julia Roberts -- or at least a wry pretty unhappily married burned-out teacher named Mercedes into whom the real Julia Roberts pours her iconic smiles giggles moues and adorable throat clearings. (Breaking Bads Bryan Cranston plays Mercedes lemon of a husband a belittled cartoon man given absolutely no redeeming qualities and thus safely audience-approved for ditching.) Then Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw from TVs short-lived Undercovers) a perky sexy classmate and fellow scooter enthusiast (she rocks a rare Italjet Bella Figura) adopts Larry as her own personal What Not to Wear project. She remakes his image so that shed of a dorky haircut dorky eyeglasses dorky khakis and a dorky tucked-in polo shirt the real Tom Hanks inside Larry can shine through. Thus does Larrys inner Hanks soften and brighten Mercedes inner Roberts. For added color Star Treks George Takei plays an economics professor who sounds like Mr. Sulu. Plus theres a motor parade Larry Crowne marks Tom Hanks first work as a director since his delightful That Thing You Do 15 years ago. And now as then the star demonstrates a generous instinct for calm steady pacing and cleanly framed scenes that acknowledge every characters place in the whole whether in the classroom on the streets or in the working world When for example Larry draws on his Navy skills to take a job as a short-order cook Hanks the director observes the work of every diner employee with genuine interest. Such classic decency counts for a lot making it easier for Hanks and his big-name costar to blend in as ""regular"" people each of whom is trying to get out of a rut. Its easy enough to accept the romantic-comedy luck of the two finding each another. Its much tougher and ultimately useless to buy everything else about this fairy tale of self-reinvention in a stalled economy.

Movie stars may be less valued than they used to be but its still puzzling to see Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts stuck in a romantic comedy as flat-footed and tone deaf as ""Larry Crowne."" The story of a middle-aged average Joe who goes to college finds love and befriends a veritable rainbow coalition of upbeat minorities Hanks first directorial effort since 1996s ""That Thing You Do"" is an insipid mid-recession fable in which every honest laugh and emotion has been sanitized out of the equation. Chemistry-free lead duo looks unlikely to energize long-term commercial prospects for this Universal release. It takes a particularly deft cinematic hand (Frank Capras ideally) to express solidarity with the working man without coming off as clueless condescending or in the case of ""Larry Crowne"" both. Striving to touch on current economic woes in a warmly humorous vein the screenplay by Hanks and co-scribe Nia Vardalos strikes the wrong note from its first scene in which likable blue-collar type Larry (Hanks) is rudely let go from the Walmart-like chain store where hes worked for years. With no bachelors degree and a mountain of alimony and mortgage payments Larry decides to start over and simplify turning in his SUV for a motor scooter and enrolling at his local community college. On his first day of class he meets Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a cute free-spirited thing who inexplicably invites him to join her friendly biker gang. Spouting perky life lessons like ""A man on a scooter can accomplish anything"" Talia gives her new friend a cool name (""Lance Corona"") and a makeover to match cutting his hair overhauling his wardrobe and going all feng shui on his living room. Not unlike Vardalos ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (which Hanks produced with wife Rita Wilson who has a bit part here) ""Larry Crowne"" is predicated on the notion that the average white guy is a nice bland personality-free dolt on whom wacky but non-threatening minorities can project their particular quirks. These include not just Talia but also her macho Latino b.f. (Wilmer Valderrama) a Zen-like Japanese economics professor (George Takei amusingly cryptic) and the black neighbors running a perpetual yard sale (Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson wasted). But the individual who really changes Larrys life is his icily beautiful speech professor Ms. Mercedes Tainot (Roberts) whos trapped in a miserable marriage to Dean (an ill-used Bryan Cranston) a layabout who spends most of his time surfing for porn (though its a measure of how squeaky-clean the film is that even Deans erotica collection is strictly PG-13). Husband and wife quarrel repeatedly in a series of unpleasant scenes whose sole dramatic purpose is to drum up sympathy for Ms. Tainot when her interest in Larry turns decidedly extracurricular. A creepy (if age-appropriate) student-professor romance would have at least introduced a welcome element of disreputability subverting the movies intended spirit of heartwarming character-building uplift. Instead the script waffles and rationalizes asking viewers to believe Larry and Ms. Tainot share a love that transcends any wrongdoing yet taking pains to reassure us that they havent in fact really done anything wrong. Its an awful lot of fuss to justify the faint pleasure of seeing Hanks and Roberts together onscreen (the two were previously paired in ""Charlie Wilsons War""). Tamping down her natural screen appeal Roberts has been instructed to act brittle short-tempered and irrationally man-obsessed. The result is a character who all but seethes with contempt some of which almost seems to be directed at the material. As helmer co-writer and star Hanks goes in the opposite direction courting viewer affection with dumb grins adorably un-hip postures and other busy cutesy tics. ""Larry Crowne"" could almost be called an anti-vanity project At this point in his career Hanks shouldnt have to strip down to his skivvies for a laugh. Recognizably shot in and around Los Angeles pic often features too much dead air around intended punchlines. Score and soundtrack never function in a less-than-obvious manner.

Daily Edition Login to download Larry Crowne Film Review 430 PM PDT 6/28/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A romantic comedy whose obsession with easy laughs undermines the dramatic opportunities in a story about a suddenly jobless man. TWITTER Tom Hanks film about a recently unemployed middle-aged man co-stars Julia Roberts Wilmer Valderrama and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Who knew that getting downsized could be such a ""laff riot?"" Where Company Men found stark drama even tragedy in losing a job Tom Hanks ever the optimist sees an opportunity for laughs and romance. The title character in Larry Crowne has his life go suddenly out of balance -- and the film experiences a similar problem. Sure the film is a romantic comedy starring Hanks and Julia Roberts but every scene is on the prowl for laughs at the expense of the inherent drama in the lives of its colorful characters. Fans of the two stars -- among the most popular actors in Hollywood over the past two decades-plus -- probably wont mind the light sitcom approach but there was a much more meaningful if somewhat darker movie in the story Hanks dreamed up with the help of Nia Vardalos. Positioned perfectly for a July 4th weekend release the film which sees Hanks performing multiple duties of director co-writer co-producer and star should be a winner at the box office. The problematic approach is evident in the films first key scene. Hanks Larry Crowne an affable middle-level manager of a big-box store gets fired when new ownership dislikes the fact that he never went to college. But the scene is played for comedy. Certainly you can see the pain in Larrys face but the managers doing the dirty deed are smug unfeeling caricatures. This continues throughout the film. Roberts character Mercedes a burnt-out public-speaking teacher is caught up in a disastrously crumbling marriage. Her husband (Bryan Cranston) has gone from a respected published author to a deadbeat who surfs the Internet for porn. What caused such a profound change in the man -- not to mention Mercedes sour attitude toward her job and students -- is never investigated but rather used as the source for further comedy. Larry Crowne mostly feels like the pilot for a sitcom that needs to set up several comic situations. Underwater with his mortgage and out of work Larry holds a yard sale which sets up the first situation His neighbors (Cedric the Entertainer and Taraji P. Henson) living off the earnings of a big game-show win hold daily yard sales where the comic banter bargaining and advice-giving fill several of the movies scenes. Larry then decides to go to a community college where the speech class taught by Mercedes and an Economics 1 course taught by George Takeis weirdly funny professor set up two more sets of characters. Finally when Larry trades in his gas-guzzling SUV for a motorbike he gets recruited into a motorcycle ""gang"" headed by the vivacious Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and her boyfriend Dell (Wilmer Valderrama). Indeed Talia -- a dangerously beautiful young woman who develops a flirtatious relationship with the middle-aged Larry right under the wary eyes of her boyfriend -- gives Larry a complete make-over She performs feng shui on his house redoes his entire wardrobe and threatens to completely distract the romantic comedy away from Hanks and Roberts. Even Mercedes assumes for much of the movie that theyre a couple. Hanks has a lot of good ideas for a comedy about a man remaking his life but he might have chosen the wrong writing partner in Vardalos. Her comic writing tends toward on-the-money scenes with her main characters and pure caricatures for all her minor ones. She got away with this -- boy did she ever -- in the hugely successful My Big Fat Greek Wedding which Hanks produced. But here the determination to go for easy laughs undermines any chance for meaty drama. This is especially true for Roberts Mercedes. If you didnt cast this role with a star who can bring her own charisma and personality to the role you might not even like this character. Shes closer to Martha in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? than the writers no doubt intended -- a drunk married to a drunk who seemingly lives to fight with her spouse. Plus her nastiness toward Larry and her hot-and-cold relationship with him make you wonder why hes even interested in her. But of course you do know because shes Julia Roberts and hes Tom Hanks. Somehow the movie keeps getting distracted from its own story -- how a man reinvents himself and in so doing finds the woman of his dreams. The key problem might be the totally passive nature of its protagonist. In the opening scenes Larry is shown as a proactive employee full of initiative. Understandably he loses some of that drive when he gets fired. But from this point on circumstances and other characters force him to change. He only goes along for the ride when Talia redoes his hair attire and household or when a drunken Mercedes comes on to him. Even when he does land a job as a short-order cook it isnt his idea. How long will it be before Mercedes is ridiculing Larry like she did her husband? Hanks gets good performances from his cast -- and that includes himself. He may if anything underplay his scenes to let others especially those playing the speech students get a chance to shine individually. Hanks crew does a fine if undistinguished job on various locations in the Los Angeles area. The junior-college campus and classrooms the homes streets coffee shop and offices all seem very pleasant which again somewhat undermines the grim reality of joblessness in America.

Directed co-written by and starring Tom Hanks in that title role the film seems to want to be some kind of post-recessional pick-me-up an ""It Gets Better"" video for the struggling aging-out American middle-class. And with its eager-to-please congeniality it almost works but with a pacing that is at once comfortably assured and frustratingly slack like holding exactly to the speed limit on a stretch of open road Larry Crowne never quite comes to life.As the film opens Larry seems content with his lot in life--at least in the few short moments he is on-screen before being abruptly fired for lacking a college education from his job at U-Mart a big-box store chain with the sneakily obtuse corporate culture of Walmart and the red-shirt/khaki-pants dress code of Target. This starts Larry off on a process of personal reinvention that finds him enrolling in community college as a way to better arm himself for the next job becoming a motor-scooter enthusiast and almost inadvertently wooing his age-appropriate teacher (Julia Roberts).There isnt much in the way of fresh-wound wallowing Larry quickly and simply gets to the business of starting over. Any dissatisfactions he may have before embarking on this new chapter in his life are glossed over quickly with just a mention of having been passed by for a promotion and a relatively recent rough divorce (his ex-wife never even gets a name). The film is so intent on remaining upbeat seeing the positive that it more or less forgets to acknowledge the negative.A film about a late-middle-aged man forced to start fresh would presumably get some mileage from a stuck-in-his-ways reluctance to try new things but Larry is immediately open and receptive to change adapting quickly to exchanging texts with younger students adopting a snazzy new wardrobe and even starting to wear a wallet chain. There is never a strong enough sense of what was missing from Larrys previous life--what he is changing from or any dashed dreams or paths not taken--to really appreciate who he is changing into.Despite opening with a fast-paced montage of Larry at work set to ELOs bouncy ""Hold On Tight"" (and ending with ELOs ""Calling America"") tonally Larry Crowne is actually more of a mid-tempo groover in line with the three Tom Petty songs it prominently features including a scooter-riding sequence set to ""Runnin Down a Dream."" Purposefully or not the film takes on the character of those songs and their titles--unassuming and craftsmanlike with a vague if vaguely unconvincing undercurrent of optimism.Roberts who seems to have settled permanently into her recent screen persona of always being vaguely pissed off plays a character with more obvious things to be upset about as a community-college English teacher. As her husband a struggling sci-fi writer who mistakes blog-reading and comment-leaving for actually being productive Bryan Cranston provides a needed jolt of energy. The scene that finds them both just soused enough to really let each other have it on the drive home from dinner has a sense of friction and spark that is missing from the rest of the movie.Larry Crowne seems to be in some sense about getting rid of your shit dropping the baggage be it physical or spiritual that bogs each of us down--a theme made literal with both Larry and Robertss Mrs. Tainot signaling forward movement by putting some stuff out front on the lawn. In trying to make Larry Crowne into a free-floating everyman Hanks turns the film into something disconcertingly untethered generalizing contemporary issues of downsizing and foreclosure and worries about gas mileage and accepting The New into something so blithely nondescript as to carry no real weight. If Hanks is even aware that Larrys wallet chain is less a symbol of hip rebirth than a signal of a geezer hopelessly chasing youth as a filmmaker he doesnt have the teeth to reveal it.

It is also further proof that craven Hollywood studios should never allow a major player to direct his or her long-cherished pet project. Never at any point does this movie touch upon reality. Ex-Navy cook turned U-Mart employee of the month Larry Crowne (Hanks) gets the sack swaps his gas-guzzling 4x4 for a secondhand scooter and signs up for community college where his public- speaking teacher turns out to be the jaded Miss Tainot (Roberts) who self-medicates with cocktails while her self-published loser husband surfs porn. Being an all-round good guy but also a fish out of water the innocent hard-working Larry is instantly embraced by his young fellow students receiving a sartorial and tonsorial makeover from the beautiful free-spirited Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and her scooter-riding pals before catching the eye of his equally lovely teacher.After the fizzy pop-tastic stylings of That Thing You Do this is a backward step for director Hanks whose co-writer Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) must share the blame for a script that is flat anodyne and littered with lazy coincidences. Hanks is as loveable as ever Roberts flashes her billion-dollar smile and - as in Charlie Wilsons War - they do make a funny charmingly mismatched couple. Scene stealer Mbatha-Raws Talia dreams of owning her own secondhand clothing store and this is like a well-worn vintage dress comfortable but a little threadbare.

Ok . . it doesnt quite deliver but its warm and engaging and has a subtlety and charm which is very refreshing the hard-edged fast-editing of rom-coms aimed at the 16-30 age group. Most successful is the link the film makes between the development of womens lib and the growth of the porn industry . .. The film doesn t develop this theme but it hits the nail on the head and is proof that this film is more firmly grounded in reality than one might think. . . . . .However the plot development follows the more formulaic . . . `she doesnt dig him then she does` which is the stock in trade of most rom coms. Fortunately youve got just class acts as Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts as leads who are both capable of giving the maximum depth to any screenplay . . . . I agree this film isnt perfect but its gentle humour and likeable characters make it pleasantly watchable . . .Those who liked Dustin Hoffman in `Last Chance Harvey` will like this. .

Id put it alongside other mid-life crises films like Dan in Real Life or Crazy Stupid Love - but whereas those films have nice moments of drama (alongside the comedy) and you can believe that Steve Carells characters are real (or at least realistic enough) Hanks Larry Crowne just seems too schmaltzy and too Hollywood. In some scenes Crowne acts a bit too much like Forrest Gump to be taken seriously. Its a shame because there are some nice scenes with a decent bit of underplayed drama (like the beginning part where Crowne loses his job). I really like Hanks as an actor (who doesnt?) so Ill always watch him in a film even when the film isnt the best. In the case of Larry Crowne this is one of those films. Its a two star film but Ill give it an extra star because Im a Hanks fan.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 10 2011heartofallenglandFeaturedDreadful. Disappointing. I would have walked out half way through but my film-buddy for the night had fallen asleep and I was too much of a gent to let her wake up all alone.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 7 2011kazFeaturedI am a huge fan of Tom Hanks but this failed to deliver on every level.The script was poor no depth to any of the characters what exactly did Julia Roberts character teach? Ive always found her annoying and over rated no chemistry between the 2 leads Hanks carried the film but he is capable of so much better than this below average rubbishFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 7 2011CarolineFeaturedIm usually easily pleased at the cinema but this was awful. Schmaltzy and self indulgent with a minimal plot. Pointless disconnected sub plots didnt contribute anything other than fill in time. I was grateful to fall asleep for a few minutes in the middle. Disappointing. One star for a nice idea.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 7 2011GSFeaturedAs somebody has already said this is a self indulgent fantasy for Tom Hanks. Pretty average fare  quickly forgotten.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2011EdFeaturedVery sweet and good-natured but light as a feather.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 4 2011bowen gregg latticeFeaturedWatchable tale but the 2 leading characters werent really credible or believable and had very little on screen chemistry which meant i couldnt care less whether they got together or notFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 3 2011MikeFeaturedIm surprised how wide of the mark I found Nigel Floyds Time Out review of Larry Crowne. Admittedly Hanks and Roberts have had their share of Oscar wins and complete flops. That said I dont see this film as either a flop or an Oscar winner. Its a very comfortable tale of the recession-hit times with Hanks character seeking the education he never had. Judging by the way no one walked out and the consistent chuckles throughout the rest of the audience though this film good entertainment. If as Floyd says this movie was made for 5 million itll make the studio and backers a few bob - the cinema in which I saw it was nearly full. Like ""Robert"" and ""John Wages"" (below) I enjoyed it. Recommended. Three stars or 7/10.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 3 2011RobertFeaturedDoesnt pretend to be any more than it is - just a couple of hours of fairly enjoyable  warm-hearted rom-com fluff.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89843/larry-crowne.html,200,larrycrowne37,larrycrowne,timeout
