""Return to Me"" Bonnie Hunts feature directorial debut is a simplistic highly contrived romantic comedy about the mysterious workings of fate -- in this case a love affair between a young widower and a waitress who unbeknownst to him has received his late wifes transplanted heart. How successful this harmless but unexciting confection will be at the B.O. will depend greatly upon whether David Duchovnys ""X-Files"" fans support the film. Beyond that however this serio-comedy does have a number of other commercial points in its favor a PG rating an amiable performance by Minnie Driver and a skillful senior supporting cast most prominently Carroll OConnor in his first studio feature in more than 25 years. As an actress Hunt has made her mark in mostly comic roles that recall the snappy delivery style of Eve Arden. But as a helmer and co-scripter she has opted for safe middlebrow and predictable fare -- pic is marketed as ""a comedy straight from the heart."" Taking its title from a Dean Martin song ""Return to Me"" strives to gain situate itself in the territory of ""Moonstruck"" which also exploited a Martin song and used several older characters as a Greek chorus commenting on the actions of the younger protagonists. As lightweight in ideas as ""Moonstruck"" was at least it boasted major stars and buckets of charm that ""Return"" lacks. First reel chronicles the happy marriage of Bob Rueland (Duchovny) a successful architect-engineer and Elizabeth (Joely Richardson) an ambitious zoologist who devotes herself to the construction of a new gorilla habitat at Chicagos Lincoln Park Zoo until her untimely death in an accident. Living a routine existence in the same city is Grace Briggs (Driver) a waitress at OReillys no doubt the towns only Irish-Italian restaurant. Living with her loving grandpa Marty (OConnor) Grace is a shy woman about to receive a new lease on life through a heart transplant. Since the audience knows that Graces new heart will come from Elizabeth pics only puzzles concern the specific circumstances under which Bob and Grace will meet and when will Grace tell him about her link to his wife. In the wake of his mates sudden death Bob sinks into deep depression his only consolation being the companionship of their dog. Matchmaking efforts by his veterinarian friend Charlie (David Alan Grier) prove fruitless as Bob is not quite ready to start over. That is until he meets Grace at her familys restaurant which he patronizes on what turns out to be a disastrous blind date. Shy Grace whos haunted by the tragic circumstances that took her mother from her when she was a child begins to blossom as Bob pays more and more attention to her. Lacking wit and sophistication ""Return to Me"" registers as a sappy life-affirming fairy tale whose only link to reality is Bobs sense of loss. About half of the yarn is set at OReillys a venerable joint where a lively clique of oldsters watch over Grace -- and dispense wisdom. Group includes grandpa Marty Italian uncle Angelo (Robert Loggia) lonely-hearts Emmett (Eddie Jones) Wally (William Bronder) and Sophie (Marianne Muellerleile). Very much in the spirit of ""Moonstruck"" though sans that movies canny intelligence pic panders aggressively to its senior citizens. Suffering from draggy pacing and excessive running time comedy occasionally comes to life in scenes set in the home of Megan (Bonnie Hunt) Graces best friend and a mother of five and her vulgar working class hubby Joe (James Belushi). That the saga ends happily with the wedding of two of its senior characters rather than that of the romantic leads smacks of political correctness as well as films intent to win the older demographics. Sights of Rome where aspiring painter Grace goes to rethink her life and art offer some delights though here too helmer cant resist being cute when she shows how some local nuns get excited and go for a euphoric ride on Graces red bike. Production values particularly lensing by vet Laszlo Kovacs are proficient and acting of Duchovny and Driver is decent though both thesps deserve much better material.

Starring Minnie Driver David Duchovny David Alan Grier Joely Richardson Robert Loggia Carroll OConnor Jim Belushi Bonnie Hunt. Directed by Hunt. (PG. 116. At Bay Area theaters.) The old trick of tugging at heartstrings warms a paper- thin story in ""Return to Me"" the sweet new romantic comedy that rides on a bit of fantasy and drama as well to attain a touching inspirational tone. For fans of anything Chicago this one will set well -- it emphasizes Second City as a cozy urban fairyland of old neighborhoods where salt-of-the-earth working-class people reside. ""Return to Me"" is the directorial debut of actress-comedian Bonnie Hunt who also has a featured best friend role and co- wrote the script with former comedy partner Don Lake. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny are the romantic leads. Driver in particular is a beautiful bundle of gushing energy as a waitress in her familys Irish-Italian restaurant and bar. Shes eager to find love and her doting Irish Catholic granddad (Carroll OConnor) and cronies are eager to help. Old-fashioned as all get-out ""Return to Me"" is swathed in an unabashed feel-good tone. Viewers willing to step into the sappy game plan are sure to walk away with the glow. On the other hand some will take it as flat trite treacly annoying and no place for Agent Mulder to hang out even if he does want to try different roles. Strong opinions on both sides are likely but just as sure is agreement that wonderful turns are given by a supporting cast that includes David Alan Grier (""A Soldiers Story"" TVs ""In Living Color"") Robert Loggia and Jim Belushi. The story opens with perfect young marrieds Bob and Elizabeth Rueland (Duchovny and Joely Richardson). Hes a successful construction company owner shes a celebrated zoologist working with gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo. A more attractive more loving pair has rarely been seen. With their bounding pet dog they live in a smart Near North apartment and seem to have it all. But before you can blink out a tear of joy the sunny Elizabeth is killed in an auto accident. Her heart is donated to an organ transplant pool. Bobs heart is crushed in a state of permanent grief. But heart is what makes this film tick. Drivers waitress Grace Briggs suffers from a congenital heart condition. She gets Elizabeths heart in a transplant operation. Move ahead in time and Grace is up and about like a champ the very picture of a pert young single ready to be scooped up by Mr. Right. Time also softens Bobs grief -- he thinks about dating again. And talk about Mr. Right. Romantic comedies rarely have believable situations going for them but this one has to be forgiven for pushing the envelope. The film is saved throughout by its inviting atmosphere and richness of characters. Driver lights up whole scenes with her great smile. Duchovny is solid as a construction type. Whats good is they play normal everyday people. Secondary characters stand out too. Zoo veterinarian Charlie (Grier) is a hoot making a mess as a matchmaker helping Bob get out again. Restaurateurs Marty OReilly (OConnor) Graces overly protective grandfather and his in-law partner Angelo Pardipillo (Loggia) are barons of a funny backroom social club of senior citizens (Eddie Jones William Bronder Marianne Muellerleile) slinging bull over card games. Hunt plays Graces best friend Megan mother of five. Her hubby Joe (Belushi) is a classic Chicago working-class type. In a memorable kitchen scene and a bowling-alley sequence Belushi comes across as a guy truly having a ball. And the fun rubs off. ..

Movies by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Posted April 7 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT The effortlessly appealing Bonnie Hunt who debuts as a feature director also costars as the stalwart best friend of the leading lady in Return to Me. Its a supporting role Hunt knows well kin to the snappy sister she played in Jerry Maguire. But as inevitably happens Hunt is so vibrant that the movie suffers when shes not around. That Return to Me is a frothy ethnic love story/medical triumph part Moonstruck part ER isnt a problem; the movie fulfills its contract as a fairy tale. That the glossy designated hero and heroine dim next to Hunts throwaway sparkle is. David Duchovny plays Bob a gifted architect whose zoologist wife (Joely Richardson) dies in a car accident. Minnie Driver is Grace a sunny but literally heartsick waitress at her familys homey bistro who benefits from Bobs tragedy when she receives his late wifes ticker. When Bob unknowingly plunks his heinie down in Graces diner her Irish grandpa (Carroll OConnor) her Italian great-uncle (Robert Loggia) and their melting-pot cronies do a matchmaking jig. Return to Me (cowritten with Don Lake) is Hunts doilied valentine to jump-starting love; its also a billet-doux to her native Chicago. (Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs saturates the city with ripe color.) But the director is stymied by the lack of flutter between the would-be lovers. The alluringly deadpan Duchovny -- his taste for light subversive comedy so often hidden by X-Files grimaces -- can make no headway with Driver who looks perpetually lacquered and ready for her In Style close-up. Which brings me back to Hunt. Theres more hotcha in one moment of flirty-comfy bantering between Hunt (as a mother of five) and marvelous James Belushi as her beer-drinking bare-bellied husband than in two hours of Duchovny and Driver revolving in their separate orbits around the Second City planet of love. Moonstruck? These two are movie-star struck.
