This action comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber builds a sentimental strain into its violent stunts; the window-smashing and car-crashing offer some giddy surprises but the ridiculous yet bland gunplay is as generic as the setup. Nonetheless Johnson commands the screen with his odd hesitations and deadpan line readings and the script gives him some wildly eccentric situations in which to shine; against all odds he lends real emotion to the flimsy artifice.

Privacy Policy or Movie review Johnson Hart save Central Intelligence (sort of) Katie Walsh Tribune News Service on Jun 16 2016 Published in Entertainment News Subscribe Subscribe Your email is safe with us. Privacy Policy or Did you know that America has two sweethearts? Obviously they are Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. This is a fact. So what happens when these two nuclear bombs of charm share one screen? Their sheer charisma manages to breathe life into a flimsy and forgettable action comedy. If ""Central Intelligence"" is worth seeing its only for the one-two punch of Johnson and Hart doing what they do best.Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"" ""Were the Millers"") who also shares writing credit with Ike Barinholtz (comedian/actor from ""Neighbors"" and ""The Mindy Project"") and David Stassen the script is powered by a healthy appreciation for internet memes and a rather thin rogue CIA agent plot wrapped around a high school reunion premise. The story isnt all that important to the enjoyment of ""Central Intelligence"" but it gives us the opportunity to enjoy Harts inimitably hilarious indignant sputtering playing the straight man to Johnsons weirdo comic stylings.Johnson plays Bob Stone formerly known as Robbie Weirdicht (hope youre not reading this review out loud) who was a chubby bullied kid in high school though a very good dancer with a thing for En Vogue. His brutal nude humiliation in front of the whole school at the hands of bully Trevor (who grows up to be Jason Bateman doubling down on his innate jerky qualities) opens the film. But ugly duckling Robbie blossoms into the swan Bob a strapping man of a singular physique and a very specific set of Jason Bourne-style combat skills.On the eve of their 20th high school reunion Bob Facebooks the one kid who was nice to him in those days the coolest guy in school Calvin Joyner (Hart). Straight-laced accountant Calvin married to his high school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) is in a slump and when the muscular strapping oddball Bob shows up its a welcome distraction for Calvin. Whats not so welcome is the CIA at his door led by Agent Harris (Amy Ryan) claiming Bob is a murderous psycho and rogue agent. Theres a bunch of spy stuff about faked deaths transaction numbers offshore accounts and Bob needing Calvin for his ""forensic accounting"" skills to get him out of this mess.But thats not what this movies about. This movie is about bizarre little jokes one-off riffs Bobs ubiquitous leather fannypack like the one Johnson sports in an early 90s photo widely circulated online; its about ""honeybadger"" jokes and Harts nervous nelly routine thats so tightly wound that the wheels start to come off the bus. At one point panicked he confesses ""my greatest weakness is that I cant make bird noises"" while ca-cawing futilely. Its so strange and yet so funny.In playing the straight man the guy who peaked in high school Hart finally gives a real performance not just his schtick. In fairness his schtick is effective its what we want to see and Hart parcels it out in just the right dosage. His turn eclipses Johnsons comedic one though theres no denying the weapons-grade charm and likability that the man exudes onscreen. While ""Central Intelligence"" doesnt have much going for it beyond its leading men the leading men just might be worth the price of admission.CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE2.5 out of 4 starsCast Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart Amy Ryan Danielle Nicolet Aaron Paul Jason Bateman Ryan HansenDirected by Rawson Marshall ThurberRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesRated PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.

Sometimes it counts for almost nothing. Comedies can be carried along on their spirit a little like Popeyes Wimpy being swept into the air by the aroma of a hamburger made visible in the form of a wispy beckoning hand. Thats more or less how Rawson Marshall Thurbers buddy comedy-crime caper hybrid Central Intelligence hangs together. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner a guy who was voted Most Likely to Succeed back in high school circa 1996 but whos now feeling oppressed by his going-nowhere Baltimore accounting job. Dwayne Johnson is Bob Stone an old classmate who used to be chubby but who somehow grew and solidified into--well Dwayne Johnson. Bob suffered a particularly cruel humiliation during senior year seen in an early flashback; Calvin stuck up for him in a very basic but kind way. Calvin forgot the episode but Bob never did. As the classs 20th reunion approaches Calvin embarrassed by the rut hes stuck in has no interest in attending. But Bob connects with him via Facebook and persuades him to come out for a beer. From there the new Bob Stone who looks nothing like the old Bob Stone but who has retained his high-school level of sweet embarrassing nerdiness--""Im big into unicorns. So magical right?""--lures Calvin into an adventure that involves stolen government secrets and a bunch of hotheaded CIA agents. The plot means nothing Its just a kiddie pool in which Johnson and Hart can mess around a chance for each to revel in the others particular mode of controlled craziness. Harts personal brand is built on his twitchy nervous energy. Compact and muscular hes a powerhouse of vitality wound tight like a pop-up snake coiled in a fake peanut can. You can almost see the Brownian motion of his anxiety building up. Part of the joy of watching him lies in waiting for the lid to blow off. Johnson is taller broader sunnier with an easy drawl and a quick smile. Theyre an unlikely duo a mismatched salt-and-pepper set but the contrast is goofily splendid. Johnson cools Hart down a bit; Hart pushes Johnson forward ever so slightly like a jazz drummer goosing the beat. Sometimes--often--Johnsons Bob will say something thats totally wrong as when he eagerly compliments Calvin on how well he looks in a new suit ""You look like a black Will Smith"" Harts face crumples as he registers the weirdness of this comment. ""I think that might be racist"" he says ""but Ill take it as a compliment."" It is racist probably but thats the genius of the joke Bobs spontaneous enthusiasm is so genuine that Calvin cant help but accept it--after all there are bigger battles to fight. Much of Central Intelligence works that way. Like all good comedies its dotted with things you think you probably shouldnt laugh at which only makes them funnier. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber working from a script he co-wrote with Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen keeps the story moving briskly so its flaws pass by in a blur. (Thurber also directed the 2004 Dodgeball A True Underdog Story an energetic and inventively silly comedy about everyones--or at least just my--least favorite phys ed staple.) The stealth ingredients of Central Intelligence include Amy Ryan as a stern CIA agent--Ryan is a terrific dramatic actress and its fun to watch her cut loose even as the straight woman in a comedy. But no one can steal the show from Johnson and Hart. Their dual rhythms alternately laid back and hyperactive end up in a glorious and ridiculous kind of syncopation unicornlike in its rarity and oddness. So magical right?

"Central Intelligence | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; central-intelligence ) Central Intelligence (United States 2016) June 17 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Note The review reveals the name of a couple of high profile actors who make cameo appearances. I think these are supposed to be surprises although theyre inconsequential. Nevertheless if you dont want to know dont read past the fourth paragraph. Action comedies are among the easiest films to make but the hardest ones to make well. To succeed they must not only contain enough laughs to tickle the funny bone but sufficient effective action to keep the pulse elevated. Central Intelligence fulfills neither of those criteria. With its canned predictable action sequences and mirthless attempts at humor it displays an ineptitude that is frankly shocking considering the talent involved. On paper it sounds like a workable idea a buddy movie featuring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart - two of the biggest stars in the action (Johnson) and comedy (Hart) arenas. A modern-day reworking of the Twins concept the problems start with the writing and end with the execution. Its hard to imagine a worse script. Central Intelligence isnt just hampered by a moronic storyline (suspension of disbelief be damned) but even Kevin Hart cant make the dialogue funny. I laughed once - during the end credits when an outtake breaks the fourth wall. All the best bits are in the trailer and its a terrible trailer. The movie begins ""20 years ago"" with lead characters Bob Stone (Johnson) and Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) in high school. Bobs a fat nerd who represents prime pickings for a group of bullies. The only one to come to his defense is the ultra-popular ""most likely to succeed"" Calvin. Cut to the present - Calvin married to his high school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) is slaving away in a dead-end job. On the eve of the high school reunion Bob - now a buff muscle-man - looks him up. The two go out for a drink and when a bar brawl erupts Bob shows Calvin his new moves. Turns out however that Bob isnt just a nice guy looking to reminisce - hes either a rogue CIA agent out to make a killing by selling dangerous secrets or a squeaky clean operative who has been framed. (Can you guess which one he is??) Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) doesnt seem to care whether Bob is innocent or guilty - she just wants to catch him and shell use Calvin to get her way. This sets up a lot of running around that culminates as expected at the reunion. Twins got a lot of mileage out of the chemistry between mismatched ""brothers"" Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. That movies story is forgettable - the only thing anyone remembers about it is the unlikely pairing. Central Intelligences attempt to mine the same vein of box office gold fails from the start when its evident that Johnson and Hart have all the interpersonal combustibility of two inert gases. They both seem like fish out of water. Hart neutered by the demands of a PG-13 script is uncharacteristically muzzled. Johnson forced to act like a gargantuan teddy bear is awkward throughout. The PG-13 is undoubtedly part of the problem. The movie is chock-full of bloodless violence. Perhaps 1000 rounds are fired from guns and maybe a half-dozen (max) find targets. Whats the point? Our knowledge that no one is going to be seriously injured (never mind killed) reduces the films ""action"" to routine filler. So we wait for the humor to kick in which doesnt happen. Even the inclusion of two ""name"" actors known for their comedy work (Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy) cant provoke more than a grimace. To add insult to injury the movie attempts to shoehorn an anti-bullying ""message"" into this mess. Like everything else in Central Intelligence it belly-flops. Giving a movie bully his comeuppance coupled with a line about how bullying is bad is borderline-insulting. Theres also something vaguely offensive about having the object of high school bullying turn into The Rock. Would that all of us could be so lucky. Instead of avoiding this minefield Central Intelligence foolishly tries to ""address"" it and the result is just another of many miscalculations. All of this adds up to one inescapable conclusion Just because a movie uses the word ""intelligence"" doesnt mean it has any.

Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson in Central Intelligence Claire Folger / Warner Bros. ID 8877408 Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays a former fat kid in Central Intelligence. It makes for an obvious visual contrast -- 20 years after bullied teenage outcast Robbie Weirdick (also played by Johnson digitally smoothed and plumped up) was humiliated in front of his whole high school he reappears having changed his name to Bob Stone and transformed himself into a bulging upside-down triangle. The scenario could have been the ultimate look-at-me-now revenge except that Johnson doesnt play the role with that sort of swagger. Bob is a CIA agent on the lam and while he may be 90% brawn now hes still a fanny pack-wearing unicorn-loving oddball. He also continues to idolize Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) the former high school star who decades ago was kind to him in a difficult moment and who in present day is chafing against his unexceptional adult life as a midlevel account.Central Intelligence -- which is directed by Dodgeballs Rawson Marshall Thurber off a script he wrote with The Mindy Projects Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen -- is a sloppy just-entertaining-enough comedy that keeps setting aside its more interesting reunion angst in favor of forgettably staged action. But the film has a firm grasp of Johnsons appeal as a leading man He is Hollywoods most imposing ray of sunshine a guy whose machismo is too cartoonish to be toxic; a dude who rather than flaunting his muscles as a sign of superiority presents them as an achievement that anyone can earn if one commits to a regimen that includes crushing pre-dawn cardio and devouring several pounds of cod a day. Johnson shares the physique of a bulked-up star from the 1980s but not the attitude. Hes at his best when he seems in on the joke of how silly tough-guy posturing can look (like that time when he flexed so hard that he broke the cast on his arm and healed his broken bones through the sheer force of will in Furious 7). View this image > Warner Bros. ID 8921100 And Johnsons unarguably in on the joke in Central Intelligence as he wears Kevin Smith-worthy jorts and stuffs himself into a borrowed pajama set that strains at the seams. Bob is enthusiastically deeply uncool despite how hes reinvented himself as a professional badass. He doesnt regret the person he used to be so much as the harassment he used to endure. ""I dont like bullies"" he announces to a group of would-be thugs he dispatches at a bar. He responds to one of their slurs by noting ""thats a lot of homophobia coming out of a very angry man"" and advising therapy. His is not a duckling-to-swan story so much as it is a fantasy avenger tale for outcasts everywhere Hes a lovable Sixteen Candles-worshiping dork whos been gifted with the skills of James Bond and the body of an action figure brought to life -- and whose external overhaul hasnt erased his internal scars.Johnson and Hart are a decent pairing their size differential a joke unto itself though the reliably funny Hart often seems a little aghast at his casting as the straight man as he seized every opportunity he could for some physical comedy. Hes saddled with Central Intelligences scattered moments of jarring bro-ishness though he fits in some memorable moments as hes dragged into the movies mire of nostalgia mixed with nonsensical spy intrigue. Calvins worried that he peaked in high school until Bob gives him more pressing concerns by enlisting him as an unwilling sidekick and the two avoid being arrested or shot. They end up on the run from a steely possibly evil agent played by Amy Ryan who insists that Bob is actually the untrustworthy party in this scenario. Central Intelligence turns over way too much time to its CIA storyline and indulges in slack set pieces that are never quite crisp enough to work as action and never quite funny enough to come together as comedy. View this image > Claire Folger / Warner Bros. ID 8921180 The movie is inevitably stronger when its dealing with the main characters high school baggage their former teenage selves casting long shadows over the thirtysomethings theyve become. Thats why the best scenes in the movie involve unbilled cameos during which some famous funny people turn up in the roles of Bob and Calvins former classmates. As Bobs gone from heavy to burly and Calvins stayed a little too steady their former oppressors and crushes have done their own growing up and the actors who play them fittingly contend with their onscreen images as nice guys or broad comediennes.Central Intelligence (and every other high school reunion movie) suggests that we never really leave behind the people we were in high school no matter how thoroughly we remake ourselves. But the movies final moment of triumph in which Bob revisits and redoes the worst moment of this life is a poignant instance of self-love framed as an act of outrageousness. The movie begins with Johnson as a chubby teen dancing to En Vogue by himself without a care and comes back around to that moment in a way that makes the meaningless twists along the way worthwhile. Bobs journey is not about changing the way he looks but about reclaiming the freedom he used to have.

Courtesy of Warner Bros. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The most surprising thing about the new buddy action-comedy Central Intelligence is the sight of Kevin Hart playing straight man to another actors antics. In previous comedies Hart has been the pint-sized fast-talking dynamo at the center of the action. Even in movies where hes the guy in over his head -- like the Ride Along series where he plays foolhardy novice to Ice Cubes veteran cop -- Hart remains the center of comic attention the one who generates most of the laughs. But in Central Intelligence hes initially subdued and reactive as Calvin Joyner an accountant whose no-drama life is shaken up by the sudden reappearance of his old school pal Robert Whierdicht (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) a former fat kid who after years of being mercilessly bullied has reinvented himself as a comically buff rogue CIA agent named Bob Stone.Hart might not be his usual motormouthed self this time but hes still got that edge of cynicism and snark Theres always been a kind of veiled contempt in his performances. And this time playing a former high-school hotshot whose life hasnt turned out the way he expected he gets not only some real motivation to put behind that subtle bitterness but a chance to develop it over the course of a film -- so that it becomes less about shtick and more about the characters psychology. The Rock who always seems to be a happy warrior in his movies playfully undercuts his persona as well Despite being a lethal killer drowning in his own muscles Bob Stone is also a sincere wide-eyed normie fond of fanny packs unicorns and Molly Ringwald movies. So here as Kevin Harts pissiness becomes ordinary the Rocks earnestness becomes weird. The confrontations and fights and chases in Central Intelligence are incoherent and slapdash as action scenes but theyre often hilarious as comic set pieces. When Bob the badass beats down and shoots people its mostly generic and confusing. But when the reluctant Calvin takes over -- accidentally kicking the shit out of CIA agents with his flailing arms or finding himself making an unwitting getaway with his possibly traitorous pal -- the energy picks up. EXPAND Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson in Central Intelligence Courtesy of Warner Bros. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber understands that the use of space is crucial to physical comedy Hell cleverly divert our attention to one part of the frame then surprise us with a sight gag elsewhere in the shot. He also understands the inherent humor in the physical difference between Hart and the Rock The latter can make anything look small but when he stands next to his diminutive and energetic co-star they look like a science experiment gone wrong. (Could a remake of Twins starring these two be far behind?)The plot is fairly disposable involving Bob getting in touch with Calvin on the eve of their high school reunion then whisking him away in pursuit of a mysterious international arms dealer code-named the Black Badger. (Bob needs Calvins accounting skills see.) But a group of CIA agents (led by an energetic Amy Ryan) are after Bob convinced that hes the Black Badger himself. That puts Calvin in the tough position of having to decide whether his cuddly jacked friend might actually be a sociopathic murderer in disguise. The setup works because the Rocks performance is just peculiar enough to keep us guessing and Hart proves adept at get-me-out-of-here bewilderment.The real danger with these types of buddy comedies is the over-reliance on predictable gags and comic tics. Audiences want to see Kevin Hart being Kevin Hart and they want to see the Rock being the Rock but they dont want to be too disturbed or challenged. So within that framework a smart director has to figure out how to play with the elements to bring spontaneity and surprise without completely upending expectations. Central Intelligence wont blow you out of the theater but you might be surprised at how well it works -- how genuinely funny it is -- given the familiarity of this concept.

This has a pretty good laugh quotient as far as big-budget action comedies go but who came up with the idea of making the pint-size Hart one of the sharpest comic actors working play straight man to the giant ham-fisted Johnson? (Big men are seldom funny onscreen--theres a reason Chaplin Keaton the Marx Brothers the Three Stooges Woody Allen and Hart all stand or stood about five-foot-five.) Amy Ryan lends able support as another CIA agent tracking the Johnson character whos gone rogue and Jason Bateman has two abrasively funny scenes as the former school bully now a self-righteous Scientologist.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Jun 17 2016 Culture The advertising campaign for Central Intelligence an uber-formulaic spy comedy starring the beefy Dwayne Johnson and the pint-sized comedy star Kevin Hart states that ""saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson."" When a movie has a tagline as outrageously snappy as that its hard not to speculate that the studio started with that pun and commissioned a script around it. Unfortunately the gag may be the cleverest thing about the entire film. Related Story Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising Is a Surprisingly Self-Aware Sequel That alone shouldnt write Central Intelligence off completely After all this isnt a film thats really shooting for ""clever."" The groan-inducing nature of the tagline underscores the larger point of the films existence Its an excuse to get Johnson and Hart two charming superstar actors together for two hours so that they can be delightfully silly on-screen. The plot is largely irrelevant the action mostly perfunctory but if youre a fan of either Hart or Johnsons usual movie shtick Central Intelligence is just about fun enough to recommend.The film is directed and co-written by Rawson Marshall Thurber a Hollywood oddity who seems to thrive more in silly territory than serious. His biggest hits have been Dodgeball A True Underdog Story and Were the Millers antic instantly forgettable comedies; his more serious efforts--like an adaptation of Michael Chabons novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh--fell disappointingly flat. For Central Intelligence Thurber is back in comedy mode--this is the kind of film to enjoy in a hotel room when theres nothing else on cable.Its highlights include Johnson whos a bona-fide movie star who rarely seems to find projects that match his magnetic screen presence. Perhaps its his next-level beefiness which usually slots him into a specific role as the stone-faced straight man in a comedy. Central Intelligence is wise enough to undo that stereotype having Johnson play Robert Weirdicht (yes its pronounced ""Weird Dick"") a high-school dweeb who looked up to star athlete Calvin Joyner (Hart) in his youth and became a hard-bodied CIA action hero in an effort to emulate his popularity. Hart meanwhile peaked in his teens and has become a pencil-pushing nobody though equipped with the manic energy Hart brings to all of his performances.In flashbacks CGI trickery turns Johnson into an overweight awkward fool of a teenager singing with abandon in the gym showers and getting publicly bullied in an early sequence that pushes both good taste and visual credibility (computer-generated teen Robert looks downright bizarre though not as strange as Johnsons turn as The Scorpion King). But the film pulls it off by staying resolutely on Roberts side and carrying his goofy personality over to adulthood where he gets to inhabit Johnsons chiseled form. Robert still loves unicorns singing En Vogue and sharing dated memes (he reconnects with Calvin on Facebook by sending him a link to the Budweiser ""Wassup"" commercial). But hes also an international superspy.The problem with this is that it forces Hart into the straight-man role which feels like a waste of his live-wire talents. A dull accountant who bemoans the loss of his glory days Calvin spends most of the film reacting to Roberts martial-arts and sharpshooting expertise with delight and horror while being dragged from one location to the next by a perfectly nonsensical plot. There are double agents encrypted codes and a CIA authority figure played by Amy Ryan whose trustworthiness is suspect but its hard to buy into any of Central Intelligences perfunctory twists. The story here is Robert and Calvins reconnection and the joke that you can never quite shake who you were in high school--the bullets whizzing around are almost beside the point.Still Johnson is a gifted enough physical comedian that he sells some of the set-pieces. Part of the joke with Robert is that hes utterly unflappable in the field dispatching assassins with delighted ease while Calvin contributes jittery yelps alongside him. Early on confronted with a knife-wielding enemy Robert picks up his only available weapon to counter with--a banana--and the audience is never in doubt as to who will win that showdown. Anytime Robert is in action mode the stakes are decidedly low.But when he reunites with his old high-school bully (played in adulthood by a sneering Jason Bateman) he freezes up and theres just enough pathos to the moment for it to land partly because the film never fails to celebrate Roberts goofiness. ""I realized high school was nothing like Sixteen Candles"" he confides to Calvin recalling his experiences with bullying. ""And Ill never be like Molly Ringwald."" Central Intelligence does its best to make Johnson its Molly Ringwald--and its that effort that makes it just memorable enough to recommend.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

""Central Intelligence"" is not that movie. Well except for the giant plate-glass windows thing. Instead its a mostly dumb but often weirdly sweet action comedy about bullies high-school friendships and grown men who still love John Hughes movies. Oh and who happen to be spies. MORE A few words with Kevin Hart Dwayne Johnson is the secret agent Kevin Hart the guy he knew back in high school. But when Johnsons operative is caught up in a complex conspiracy Harts accountant is the only one who might help him figure out the figures. Which is cool really because now in between dodging assassins they have all that time to catch up. The espionage plot isnt well thought out (in fact its the weakest part of the movie). But the casting - and the twist that puts on the characters - makes the film more fun than you might think or its own smirking posters might suggest. Were fully expecting - and hoping for - motor-mouthed outrage from Hart (who mixes panic and anger better than anyone). But here he plays a high-school star an alpha male whos depressed over his current very beta real life. Thats fresh. And refreshingly outrageous is Johnson. Yes in keeping with expectations he plays a physically imposing killing machine. But he also plays against type creating a sensitive over-emotional man whos still reliving the embarrassments of high school. And thats funny. There are two other nice narrative swerves both involving unexpected guest stars and while theyre not essential to the plot they are instrumental to the fun. (The one that comes towards the middle of the movie added a whole half-star as far as I was concerned.) Without those occasional outside-the-box choices - and particularly Johnson having a ball playing a fannypack-wearing unicorn-loving sweetheart - ""Central Intelligence"" would barely register. Its a little long the plot feels like an afterthought and although a fight in an office is inventively staged the other action sequences are generic. But every so often director Rawson Marshall Thurber -- who also gave us the out-from-left-field hit that was ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"" - smartly throws something unexpected into the mix. Johnson pulls a silly face. Hart slips in a little improv. Yes intelligence is hardly central to whats going on here. But this movie isnt nearly as dumb as it looks. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and brief nudity. Central Intelligence (PG-13) Warner Bros. (114 min.) Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. With Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart.

(Claire Folger) Kevin Hart left and Dawyne The Rock Johnson star in Central Intelligence which follows the exploits of an inept super spy.(Claire Folger) Central Intelligence - like The Rock himself - is silly and lighthearted Add to ... Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 17 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 17 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber Written by Ike Barinholtz David Stassen Rawson Marshall Thurber Starring Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2016 Country USA Language English In 1997 back when The Toronto Sun was running a male counterpart to its infamous Sunshine Girl spread a hulking slab of testosterone named Rocky graced the pages of the tabloid. Clad in a snug black turtleneck and coyly clutching a leather fanny pack Rocky told the newspaper that he loved to relax on the beach his favourite musical was The Phantom of the Opera and he would someday ""like to be one of the leading stars of the [World Wrestling Federation]."" Much has changed for Rocky in the ensuing two decades - wrestling dominance Hollywood superstardom serious Instagram game - but the man now known as Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson is still sporting the fanny pack at least in his new comedy Central Intelligence. The style relic - if it was even considered in style during the late nineties - is a small detail in the film but an important one.As the only consistent element to Johnsons cinematic wardrobe the accessory underlines the actors eagerness to embrace the self-deprecating goofiness of Central Intelligence which finds him playing a rogue CIA agent whos more than a bit insane. The fanny pack and Johnsons ultra-confident rocking of it represent everything you need to know about both the film and The Rock himself silly lighthearted and impossible to not inspire at least half a smile.Most films would be so lucky to have secured Johnson and the irrepressible cheeriness he brings to the screen and indeed Central Intelligence gets passing marks simply for having the prescience to cast the man. The film might have even been better off had it focused solely on Johnson and his exploits as an aesthetically inept super-spy.Instead director Rawson Marshall Thurber pairs his imitable leading man with the ever-frantic Kevin Hart creating a buddy comedy thats pleasant enough without ever reaching the full comic heights that Johnsons casting implicitly promises.The plot is preschool-simple On the run from the agency because of a McGuffin-sized plot device Johnsons secret agent recruits an old high school friend (Hart) to help him decode some forensic accounting gobbledygook before the world explodes or something along those lines. Its all just an excuse to have Johnson (so big so imposing) and Hart (so small so nebbishy) engage in odd-couple banter and fits of shrieking among whizzing bullets and Langley tough guys.For the most part it works. Hart and Johnson bounce off each other - both verbally and physically - with ease their chemistry pushing the rest of the film through its PG-rated paces. (There are hints of a more risque surreal script by writing partners Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen though most edges seem to be sanded off by Thurber.)Yet by the time the film reaches its obvious conclusion - by the time Hart expends more energy than Bugs Bunny by the time the espionage plot twists itself into corners too convoluted for even Homeland fans by the time Thurber exhausts the audience by unleashing cameo after cameo - its only Johnson who remains standing tall. With a simple wink and a pec flex the erstwhile Rocky proves that he has more charisma than any other action star working today. Fanny pack and all.

Entertainment Inc.)Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson brings a screwy wide-eyed loopy streak to ""Central Intelligence"" that is just nutty enough to work.As Bob Stone a hulking CIA agent who grew up a bullied fat kid Johnson has never been funnier or more unpredictable. He plays his role with a big-hearted warmth mixed with a lightning bolt of insanity and the combination elevates ""Central Intelligence"" past its standard action comedy pedigree.Not that ""Central Intelligence"" is high-level stuff. The storyline which finds Johnsons Stone hooking up with his high school pal Calvin ""The Golden Jet"" Joyner (Kevin Hart) and enlisting him into the world of international espionage is just a framework for Johnson to let loose and have Hart react to him.But they make a good enough duo and Johnson -- who can be a lug in by-the-numbers blockbuster fare such as ""San Andreas"" -- is a riot as a character whose bulging masculinity is softened by his love for unicorns (""Im big time into corns"" he brags while practically tearing through his unicorn emblazoned T-shirt) and John Hughes ""Sixteen Candles.""The script by Ike Barinholtz David Stassen and director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Were the Millers"") lets Johnson flex his comedic muscles more than any previous role. And Johnson is eager to please delivering every line like he woke up early that day and was the first person on set ready to go when cameras rolled. He beams.""Central Intelligence"" otherwise boils down to base-level hijinks with a stock anti-bullying message (and a handful of decent cameos). But Johnson brings the funny.

Picture Kevin Hart and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in ""Central Intelligence."" by Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Close icon Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Kevin Hart seems to have found a second career playing the goofy vertically challenged geek opposite tough guys in formulaic buddy action comedies (BACs). Mere months after he dropped his second BAC with Ice Cube the unbearably lame bombs-babes-and-bums-filled Ride Along 2 Hart has jumped into the sack with Dwayne Johnson for Central Intelligence. Its pretty much the same BAC except here the action star is a spy not a cop - and the tough guy is a geek at heart. There is one other difference Central Intelligence is actually funny. For one thing Central Intelligence is shot from a script that contains actual dialogue rather than stage directions for endless gun fights and sex scenes. And its humor isnt mass-produced and store-bought but seriously idiosyncratic - boy is it weird Thats down to the fearless uninhibited character work by Johnson as rogue CIA officer Bob Stone who has to be one of the oddest birds this side of a Looney Tunes cartoon. We first meet Bob in 1996 when hes a shy awkward friendless Baltimore high school senior. Decked out in a nude fat suit that makes him look to be at least 350 pounds Johnson shoves his derriere into the camera in the films opening shots as he struts in his schools locker-room shower. When his classmates play a horrific prank on Bob in front of the entire student body hes rescued by the schools popular big-man-on-campus Calvin ""Golden Jet"" Joyner (Hart) - class president smokin hot baseball and basketball star prom king and the dude voted most likely to succeed. (His inner geek surfaces later.) Bob who dropped out of school that very day suddenly pops up in Calvins life during the schools 20th reunion weekend. The blubbers gone and Bob looks like . . . well he looks like the Rock. (It didnt take much to lose weight Bob tells an astonished Calvin. ""I only had to do one thing work out six hours a day for 20 years."") Despite his bulging muscles and ripped abs hes the same goofball He wears a pink and powder-blue unicorn T-shirt he carries a fanny pack wherever he goes and he waxes poetic about Sixteen Candles - its his favorite movie because he identifies so intimately with Molly Ringwalds character. Bob and Calvin make for a nice study in contrasts Bob is a superspy who is propositioned by beautiful women wherever he goes while Calvin who peaked in high school now lives a boring life as an accountant. Central Intelligence moves into high gear when a team of heavily armed CIA assassins crashes Calvin and Bobs little reunion. Led by the sadistic Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan in a disappointing lackluster performance) who claims Bob has been selling secrets to the enemy the goons chase our heroes up the Eastern Seaboard. Theres gunplay a few close calls some hot stunts blah blah blah. We dont watch BACs for the plot but for the banter the heated back-and-forth the frisson between the (invariably mismatched) heroes. To its credit Central Intelligence doesnt try to outdo other BACs when it comes to banter Its dialogue isnt faster more profane or more hyped than other movies. Its simply better written and a lot weirder. True Central Intelligence is predictable formulaic and forgettable. Its not going to enrich your life. But if you have to see one BAC this summer let it be this one. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW Central Intelligence 2 1/2 stars (Out of four stars) Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber.

Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Guess its my turn to take out the trash again. ""Central Intelligence"" is one of those slick gunplay-riddled stupidly plotted aggressively loud buddy movies -- so formulaic and dumb even if you see it youll probably forget youve seen it by the end of the year. And if thats the case consider yourself fortunate. For about a half-dozen years now Ive been writing reviews of Kevin Hart movies in which I mention how likable Hart is and what a shame it is to see his talents squandered. Here we go again. As was the case with the ""Ride Along"" movies and ""Get Hard"" Hart is cast in the role of the likable everyman who is thrust into dangerous situations where he conveys great fear by cowering trying to talk his way out of peril running away from bad guys dodging bullets howling during chase sequences and accidentally getting the better of henchmen during quick-cut fight scenes. Oh and theres the obligatory domestic subplot in which Harts character has to make things right with his beautiful but clueless significant other who is always the last one to realize her mans life is in serious danger. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber with a screenplay from a team of three writers (including Thurber) ""Central Intelligence"" alternates intermittently funny exchanges of dialogue with depressingly familiar action sequences featuring dozens of gunmen who are incredibly poor shots and car chases and fight sequences that seem to take place in towns and cities where there are no bystanders and theres no media coverage. Things explode in a vacuum. Hart plays Calvin Joyner who in 1996 was the king of his high school a top student a superstar athlete prom king in love with the most beautiful girl admired by all including the principal who actually says at an awards ceremony if he were biologically capable of having a son hed want it to be Calvin.  (The equally cringe-inducing response from Calvin If his mom were into white guys shed go for the principal.) On the eve of Calvins 20th high school reunion hes not feeling so hot about the way things turned out. Hes a mid-level forensic account on the slow track at work -- hardly living up to his ""Golden Jet"" nickname from high school. Sure hes married to his high school sweetheart the lovely and successful Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) but even her success makes him feel lousy about himself. Enter one Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson). Back in the day Bob was a morbidly obese unpopular kid who was the subject of a horribly cruel prank in front of the entire student body -- but now hes a chiseled god involved in international intrigue as a spy or maybe hes a spy gone rogue but whatever hes doing its really badass and involves lots of serious people with serious weaponry wanting him dead. One kinda funny touch Even though Bob is so chiseled he looks like a statue come to life and hes capable of taking down four or five bad guys without breaking a sweat hes still a major dork. He loves unicorns and dumb commercials from the 1990s he wears jorts and a fanny pack and hes incapable of shielding his unabashed hero worship of ""The Jet"" as he calls Calvin. You cant help but laugh at Johnsons endearing performance especially when he has flashbacks to high school traumas and hes utterly vulnerable despite his hulking persona and his trained-killer skill set. The wonderful Amy Ryan is wasted in a cliched role as a CIA agent convinced Bob is the ""Black Badger"" an international bad guy trying to gain access to secret codes that will compromise national security. (It feels as if about a dozen characters from a dozen different recent movies are out there in pursuit of secret codes that will compromise national security.) Aaron Paul has too little screen time as Bobs erstwhile partner Phil. Far too many of the one-liners in ""Central Intelligence"" contain references to pop culture from Taylor Swifts love life to ""Road House"" to ""Sixteen Candles"" to Jake Gyllenhaal to Denzel Washington to a thuddingly unfunny moment in which Hart is told he looks like ""a black Will Smith."" You can practically see the screenwriters fingerprints on the dialogue. We get cardboard bad guys who are homophobes sexist pigs bullies or some combination thereof. Just because theyre the villains doesnt excuse the low-level humor. Theres never a moment when intelligence is central to the alleged humor of this film. 1/2 New Line Cinema/Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber and written by Thurber Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen. Rated PG-13 (for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language). Running time 108 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters.

You can pick apart the plot you can groan at the fumbling attempts to give the movie some emotional integrity and you can get antsy over the action scenes in which no one can shoot straight. Not even ""trained"" experts from the CIA. But you cannot help laughing out loud. Central Intelligence is a laugh-riot Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart are hilarious on-screen partners. So there that is a guilty pleasure in my world. Co-writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurbers movie starts with its worst scene a prologue set in 1996 at a high school graduation ceremony. The schools mega-fat super-geek is thrown into the assembly buck-naked as a cruel prank by bullies. The only student to help him is the schools superhero Calvin Joyner. Flash forward 20 years to 2016 Joyner (played by Hart) is disappointed with his life as an accountant after his glory days in high school. He is reluctant to join his wife and childhood sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet) at their forthcoming high school reunion. Cue the fireworks. Our crestfallen former hero is contacted by that geek. He is now a physical specimen of staggering proportions (as played by the mighty-muscled Johnson). The twist is that Johnsons Bob Stone is a rogue CIA agent on a big case. He just happens to need the help of an accountant and Harts Calvin is the only person he trusts. Meanwhile the agency thinks Johnsons Bob is the villain so a team led by ruthless Agent Harris (Amy Ryan) is tracking him with orders to shoot-to-kill. That is the set-up. The pay-off is the series of nutzoid scenes that put Johnson and Hart together as a comedy team trying to outwit both the CIA chase agents and the real bad guys they will encounter. This plot interests me not at all. It is just an excuse to have Johnson be a big mushyball teddy bear around Hart while Hart gets to be the freaked-out everyman who tosses off funnies about movies racial stereotypes and celebrity poseurs. Hart even pillories idiot celebrities who use nicknames as dumbass as The Rock. He slings this insult into the face of Dwayne Johnson Johnson gets his revenge referring to Hart as either a bite-sized or pint-sized Denzel (as in Washington). I dont remember exactly what he said because I was chortling at the time and it scrambled my brain. Seeing the giant Johnson diss tiny Hart over his height while invoking the name of an actual celebrity was the kind of joke you usually find in Family Guy not a Hollywood action comedy. Ditto for Johnsons obsession with the John Hughes teen classic Sixteen Candles from 1984 and its star Molly Ringwald. Talk about a kinky twist for a character played by a wrassler turned actor turned CIA agent on-screen. It makes Johnsons appearances as an agent in the Fast amp; Furious franchise even more amusing. So this is a long-winded way of saying I like Central Intelligence even when it is being stupid. As the poster says you need a little Hart and a big Johnson to save the world.

Credit Claire Folger/Warner Brothers To call ""Central Intelligence"" juvenile is to miss the larger point -- namely that juvenile was most likely the goal. A majority of studio comedies have been written at an eighth-grade level or lower for so long that its astonishing how resilient our hope for greater sophistication is. Video Movie Review Central Intelligence The Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis reviews ""Central Intelligence."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 16 2016. Photo by Claire Folger/Warner Brothers Entertainment via Associated Press. Yet hope we do even as the vulgar sight gags and plot inanities pile up. And when performers as sharp and engaging as Kevin Hart are involved the disappointment is especially keen. Here he plays Calvin a dissatisfied accountant and husband still mourning his high school athletic triumphs.""Black people dont go to therapists"" he tells his concerned wife. ""We go to barbershops."" In lieu of analysis Calvin reunites with Bob (Dwayne Johnson) the once-chubby victim of high school bullies whose gratitude to Calvin for a minor act of kindness has outlasted the flab. Transformed into a solid mountain of muscle Bob has a fanny pack full of government secrets and an abiding love for Molly Ringwald. For the purposes of the movie one is no more important than the other. Video Trailer Central Intelligence A preview of the film. By WARNER BROS. PICTURES on Publish Date March 18 2016.

But not even actors with the heft of Amy Ryan Jason Bateman and Aaron Paul can fortify a screenplay (by the director Rawson Marshall Thurber and two others) thats an incoherent muddle of stolen satellite encryption codes and messily staged gun battles. Or maybe Im just weary of comedies that seem to contain more bullets than jokes.Rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"Central Intelligence is a surprisingly smart bromance between Hart and Johnson that explores male insecurity - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Central Intelligence is a surprisingly smart bromance between Hart and Johnson that explores male insecurity ""Central Intelligence"" Claire Folger / Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Dwayne Johnson top and Kevin Hart in ""Central Intelligence."" Dwayne Johnson top and Kevin Hart in ""Central Intelligence."" (Claire Folger / Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) Justin Chang ""Central Intelligence"" is dumb in all the right ways and also a bit smarter than you might expect. It jams together two frequently incompatible Hollywood modes -- the comedy and the action movie -- and somehow doesnt wind up feeling like an oil-and-water exercise Its more like oil and paint thinner. Its a 90s nostalgia trip a rambunctious spy thriller and a knucklehead bromance rolled into one and as disjointed as that sounds the movie locates in all three stories a single unifying thread of male insecurity. But rather than drowning in macho self-pity -- or its natural byproduct crudely misogynist caricature -- it throws off a weirdly disarming sweetness.Thats due almost entirely to the movies stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson whose game and likable odd-couple pairing -- its a bit like casting a hedgehog opposite a refrigerator -- seems almost inevitable in retrospect. With Hart already having starred opposite Ice Cube Josh Gad Will Ferrell and Ice Cube again (none of them to particularly memorable effect) surely it was only a matter of time before the mountainous slab formerly known as the Rock wound up on his dance card. Happily there turns out to be more to this particular duo than their 13-inch height difference (though the gag where Johnson squeezes into a set of Hart-sized pajamas is pretty priceless). Not every screenwriter would have had the inspiration to have these two naturally appealing and well-established performers play against type making Hart the rational straight-arrow type and forcing Johnson to shoulder the lions share of the laughs. Its a dumb idea in the abstract that turns out to be surprisingly smart in the execution. (The script is written by Ike Barinholtz David Stassen and the movies director Rawson Marshall Thurber.) SNAP Video ""Central Intelligence"" trailer. ""Central Intelligence"" trailer. See more videos And so Hart plays Calvin a mopey accountant whos not looking forward to his 20-year high school reunion; once the smartest most athletic and popular guy on campus hes now happily married to his class sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet) but has otherwise fallen short of the ""Most Likely to Succeed"" designation conferred on him by his classmates. Those students were not quite as kind to Robby (Johnson) an overweight over-bullied outcast who was last seen being dragged naked onto the floor of their schools crowded gym the literal butt of a cruel senior prank. In that moment Calvin was the only one who showed him a moments decency an act that Robby clearly hasnt forgotten when he suddenly resurfaces two decades later -- now slimmed down sporting a big grin and an even bigger set of muscles and hoping to renew their friendship. The plot which is at once nonsensically busy and fairly predictable can be dispensed with quickly. It gives away nothing to note that Robby -- or Bob as he now calls himself -- turns out to be a rogue CIA agent who desperately needs Calvins mad accounting skills to track down a particularly lazy MacGuffin. Nor will it surprise anyone to learn that Bob drags Calvin kicking and screaming into a confusing labyrinth of intrigue and betrayal forcing the two of them to go on the run from the Agency (led by an excellent coolly ruthless Amy Ryan) which suspects Bob of having murdered his partner.See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >>More importantly it will spoil none of your amusement to hear that Bob spends a good chunk of the picture wearing a very cute unicorn T-shirt or that he stores his state-of-the-art spy gear in a fanny pack. (His regular costume changes are among the movies most reliable sources of humor.) Johnson may be enjoying a comic breather in between his contributions to the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise but here hes playing the rare character you might actually care to see in a sequel -- a professional undercover killing machine who deep down remains the same shy sensitive traumatized ""Sixteen Candles""-obsessed worrywart he was in high school.Having previously directed the hilarious ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"" (2004) and the not-so-hilarious ""Were the Millers"" (2013) Thurber has consistently showed a natural affinity for misfits and outcasts. He also seems to have figured out that Hart is easiest to take not when hes in manic motormouth mode but instead when hes cast as a smart competent but easily flustered individual -- someone who can be counted on every so often to unleash a monologue of ingeniously improvised rage. Perhaps the most disarming conceit of ""Central Intelligence"" is that Calvin and Bobs banter even at its most combative is predicated on a kind of mutual admiration. These two guys genuinely like even idolize each other and its telling that some of their funniest line exchanges -- ""Youre like Jason Bourne in jorts"" ""Youre like a snack-size Denzel"" -- are compliments rather than insults.That sets an appreciably convivial tone for the rest of this enjoyably thrown-together movie which scores laughs even in scenes that feel like complete non sequiturs. Theres the annoying co-worker (Ryan Hansen) who speaks in hashtags. Jason Bateman a master at playing smiling sociopaths utterly obliterates his one big scene as Bobs old high-school nemesis. The soundtrack is pure Generation X catnip -- yes there will be House of Pain -- but as with almost all the retro pop-cultural footnotes here it seems an honest and affectionate expression of the characters longing for their glory days.I cringed slightly at the violent shootout that lays waste to Calvins workplace; for obvious reasons the sight of an office getting sprayed with bullets while civilians duck for cover isnt the easiest spectacle to digest this week (even if Hart Johnson and company vary their arsenal using knives and coffee pots). Blame it on bad timing or maybe just bad filmmaking Even under ideal circumstances the third-rate action-thriller shenanigans would be by far the least intelligent aspect of ""Central Intelligence."" Fortunately the moment passes and the laughs continue. You can forgive a lot when a movies Hart and its Johnson are in the right place. ------------Central Intelligence MPAA rating PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesPlaying In wide releaseALSOSteven Spielberg developing Walter Cronkite film; can it defy war-correspondent movie odds?Catch Field of Dreams at the Crest for Fathers DayFinding Dory expected to jolt sluggish summer box office Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Dwayne Johnson Ice Cube Jason Bateman Josh Gad Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-central-intelligence-review-20160613-snap-story.html#nt=oft13a-2gp1,200,centralintelligence15,centralintelligence,latimes

Claire Folger/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart star in the new action comedy Central Intelligence. Claire Folger/Warner Bros. In the marvelous action comedy Grosse Pointe Blank a 30-year-old John Cusack played a depressed assassin whose personal and professional lives intersect at his 10-year high school reunion. That movie hit theaters in 1997 one year after the principal characters in the new not-marvelous-but-still-plenty-likeable action comedy Central Intelligence graduated from high school. The film splits Cusacks Grosse Pointe character into a decidedly asymmetric duo embodied by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson 44 and Kevin ""The Pebble"" Hart 36. On the eve of his 20-year reunion Harts Calvin Joyner is in a funk. Hes happily married to his high school sweetheart and gainfully employed as an accountant but this is not the grand destiny he imagined when he was Senior Class President. (His nickname was The Golden Jet for reasons that remain tantalizingly unclear.) Meanwhile Johnsons character -- whos adopted the nothing-to-see-here-folks nom de guerre Bob Stone -- has transformed himself into a surprisingly genial superspy revenging the many cruelties visited upon him as a chubby En Vogue-loving high schooler. (A set-in-1996 prologue convincingly face-maps Johnsons mug onto the Rubenesque body of dancer Sione Kelepi. Thank you for perfecting this technology Hollywood.) As if that were not burden enough he was saddled with the name Robbie Weirdicht. When the bullies attacked during a class assembly only Calvin showed him kindness. Calvin promplty forgot that impulsive act of charity; The Whup-Ass Artist Formerly Known as Robbie Weirdicht never did. If you guessed that Bob is going to clear up Calvins midlife crisis by drawing him into a web of intrigue spanning from Maryland to er Massachusetts you wouldnt get promoted to Double-Oh status for that. But what Central Intelligence lacks in depth or inventiveness it makes up for in personality steaming along on the robust comic rapport between Johnson and Hart. They make for first-rate company in a second-rate move about The Company. You can feel the movie rolling its eyes whenever it must service its ersatz espionage plot which involves Bobs attempt to draw out a possibly-imaginary terrorist while evading C.I.A. superiors -- led by the delightfully straightlaced Amy Ryan -- who believe he has in the venerable tradition of every spy ever to rate a sequel Gone Rogue. To complete his mission Bob has need of Calvins Very Particular Set of Skills Quicken. Tax-Deferred Annuities. Um. Sarbanes-Oxley? Other accounting words to that effect. Moving on. Rawson Marshall Thurber is not despite the name an 11-term senior U.S. Senator from Alabama but rather the co-writer and director of Central Intelligence. Hes no Billy Wilder but he does manage to highlight the physical disparity between the two stars to good effect. This sight gag never gets old nor does the sight of the powder-blue unicorn T-shirt stretched across Johnsons tectonic pecs. (""Im super into corns"" he explains.) The absence of vanity in Johnsons buffoonery is appealing. Hart has the tougher job by far and hes a generous scene partner. To its credit the movie doesnt use Harts panicky straight-man schtick to make Johnson look cool. It uses it to make him look really really weird. Which brings me to this observation Though it delights in referencing Sixteen Candles and it may appear to untrained eyes to be a buddy movie Central Intelligence in fact belongs to a more highly specialized sub-genre that we might call the Manic Pixie Dream Killer flick. This canon includes the James Cameron-Arnold Schwarzenegger joint True Lies (itself a remake of the French farce La Totale) the underseen Shane Black-penned The Long Kiss Goodnight and the hardly-seen-at-all The Matador which featured an actual ex-James Bond -- Pierce Brosnan -- as a weary hitman who helps decent boring Greg Kinnear realize that his tranquil life is actually a blessing. Central Intelligence is a more relaxed affair than any of those films Less violent less interested in its characters inner lives less fatalistic shaggier. The action half of this action-comedy is perfunctory; Thurber has no gift for it. Again and again supposedly highly-trained operators fire dozens of rounds at one another from 10 feet away and miss. Spy and The Nice Guys and Grosse Pointe Blank all had witty beautifully staged action so its not as though funny movies cant. The comedy half happily is in perfect working order. Its roster of beloved comedians who put in cameo appearances shall remain classified. I just hope you can remember the title of this movie when youre looking for it on Netflix four months from now. For most of this review I thought it was called National Security.

Its bad but not painfully so -- and in a bummer summer like this one thats high praise. The long and short of Central Intelligence is that the joke is all in the central sight gag A snack-sized Kevin Hart starring opposite Dwayne Johnson who wasnt called ""The Rock"" for nothing. Hart is a master of barely controlled hysteria and Johnson is a world-class charmer. Theyre innately appealing performers even if they dont achieve the buddy bliss of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in The Nice Guys. But their first screen pairing suggests a chemistry this movie only fitfully exploits. You root for them. More News Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Dwayne Johnson The Rock in a Hard Place Kevin Harts Funny Business All Stories >> Related How The Rock Turned Back into Dwayne Johnson Following the Central Intelligence stars career from wrestler to A-lister In a prologue set in high school 20 years ago computer trickery shows us that Johnsons character Robbie Weirdicht was a fat kid relentlessly bullied by his classmates. All except for Harts kindly Calvin Joyner the popular kid voted most likely to succeed. Guess what? In the space of two decades the tables are turned. Muscled Robbie is now the rock star a rogue CIA agent who radiates charisma. And Calvin is a loser accountant whose lawyer wife (Danielle Nicolet) unintentionally makes him feel like half a man. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber whose Dodgeball is one of my guiltiest pleasures Central Intelligence has a script by Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen (The Mindy Project) that gets off a few good zingers before the action assault drowns out all signs of clever. ""Youre like a black Will Smith"" Robbie tells a befuddled Calvin. The plot such as it is involves Robbie persuading Calvin to help him track down a secret nuke code capable of destroying the world. Should Calvin trust a school friend who still watches Sixteen Candles on a continuous loop or turn Robbie over to his CIA boss (Amy Ryan slumming and loving it) who insists the friendly giant is an evil mastermind? If youre expecting the story threads to cohere youre in the wrong multiplex. Central Intelligence always takes the lazy way out. You go along for the ride because Hart and Johnson promise something they cant deliver a movie as funny as they are.

Central Intelligence however despite featuring explosions car chases shoot-outs and muscle shirts explores a softer vulnerable side of the 44-year old. Johnson gives a surprisingly varied performance one which requires an obvious (albeit broad) range to come alive beneath the shallow layers of comedic stunts and kinetic action. While not necessarily a diamond-in-the-rough itself Central Intelligence proves that Johnson has always been at the center of his own ring in more ways than one. It just took the rest of us (and Hollywood) a little longer to notice. Johnson plays a bullied obese teen who fueled by a distaste for the cruel-hearted scum of the world ultimately blossoms into a tanned-and-toned lethal CIA agent. He returns home for his 20-year high school reunion thrusting his only friend (and former classmate) a hotshot-jock-turned-lowly-accountant (Kevin Hart) into a high-stakes mission involving a race for secret codes numerous double-crosses a slighted Aaron Paul and an epic cameo from an A-list actress in its closing moments. The hows and whys of the quest at hand arent exactly important as Central Intelligence is far more concerned with squeezing its leading men together--often literally--and kicking back to enjoy the juice and thats a wise move. Paired with the scrawny squeaky-voiced Hart Johnson feeds off the inherent comedy in the juxtaposition of their bodies making the films well-timed gags and physical humor work better than they should way more often than they should. With three screenwriters (including The Mindy Projects Ike Barinholtz) Central Intelligence often feels unfocused yet without sacrificing a certain tawdry charm held together by Johnsons magnetism as he connects with a different side of his persona one that makes him an appealing star and not so much a respected actor. When hes not puffing his chest and flexing his muscles as an everyman hero in films like last years San Andreas his comedic chops and warm charisma lend themselves well to featherweight material however superficial Central Intelligence. Still in its dutiful crusade against antagonists of all shades from school bullies to corrupt CIA agents Central Intelligence deserves respect for attempting to engage with timely thematic material as much as it wants us to surrender and chuckle at the gags. Its a straightforward flick hawking fluff in an unabashed way and especially at a time when it seems as if reality around us is overrun with insurmountable darkness sometimes all you need is to watch The Rock knock someone out with a banana.

Photo Credit AP / Claire Folger advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A former nerd now a CIA superagent ropes an old friend into his latest mission.CAST Kevin Hart Dwayne Johnson Amy Ryan Aaron PaulRATED PG-13 Crude humor action several bloody momentsLENGTH 154BOTTOM LINE Hart and Johnson make a terrific team though its the latter who really shines in this action-comedy. Fun cameos ice the cake. Every few years former wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson drops his action-hero scowl and flexes his comedic muscles. In movies like ""The Other Guys"" ""Pain amp; Gain"" and even ""The Tooth Fairy"" hes consistently great. So why is it so surprising that he steals the show in the new action-comedy ""Central Intelligence""? Maybe its because Johnson has never played a character quite like Robbie Weirdicht an overweight kid who spent high school as a punching bag for bullies. His only defender was the coolest overachiever in school Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) who despite his varsity jacket student council tenure and well-received ""Hamlet"" always treated Robbie with kindness. Twenty years later Robbie has transformed himself into a CIA superagent -- now played by the hulking Johnson we all know -- but as one character cruelly notes ""Once a fat kid always a fat kid."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Is that a role The Rock can convincingly play? You bet. ""Central Intelligence"" helps him along by introducing us to the young Robbie (a digitally altered Sione Kelepi) in an opening high school scene that is both funny and heartbreaking. Still its Johnson who makes us believe Robbie is real. Throughout the film he never misses a beat as he alternates between a pumped-up action hero and a fashion-challenged misfit. ""Youre like Jason Bourne"" Calvin marvels ""but in jorts"" Hart too is dependably funny and jittery as Calvin. Hes the classic average Joe whos pulled into a wild plot involving an arms dealer an encrypted database and a steely CIA honcho (Amy Ryan) trying to take Johnson down as a rogue agent. As always Hart also gives his character a heart Calvins promising youth has devolved into workaday adulthood so maybe a little adventure is exactly what he needs. This is standard stuff but director and co-writer Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"") proves handy with action sequences (Robbies spectacular decimation of Calvins office is a treat) as well as classic shtick (Johnson even gets to don a goofy disguise) and there are moments of real camaraderie between the two stars. Movies25 big movies out this summer ""Central Intelligence"" may be a buddy-comedy but its Johnsons movie all the way.

(Claire Folger) BY Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 16 2016 237 PM Title Central Intelligence Film Info With Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart (154) PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language. In area theaters. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber. It doesnt take a genius IQ to see what the brains behind the buddy comedy ""Central Intelligence"" were thinking. Its all about the odd couple. Just mix Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson whos big as a mountain and goofily charismatic with Kevin Hart whos pint-sized overanimated and squealy. And let the espionage plot take care of itself. Except that the story doesnt. Its sloppy and half-baked. Even romps must make sense and this Swiss-cheesy script has holes and slow stretches. Yes the appealing mismatched megastars earn their paychecks with game performances. But other than an occasional zinger hitting the mark laughs are in short supply. Kevin Harts home burglarized 500G of items reportedly stolen Kevin Hart is Calvin whos facing a high school reunion. (Claire Folger) Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Were the Millers"") tries to weave in a heartstring-pulling antibullying message. But the balancing act is beyond his reach. Beginning in 1996 the film follows chubby loner Robbie Weirdicht (Johnson with gobs of CGI) who is publicly humiliated at school. Only Calvin Joyner (Hart) the most popular kid with the brightest future helps Weirdicht (say the surname out loud its meant to be funny). Aaron Paul and Dwayne Johnson in ""Central Intelligence."" (Claire Folger) Flash-forward two decades. Calvins married to his high school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) and his superbright future hasnt materialized. Hes a mid-level number-cruncher. Dwayne Johnson confirms hes playing Doc Savage Cal frets about his life as his 20th high-school anniversary looms -- at least until Robbie re-enters. The former overweight misfit is now a CIA superagent whos lost a ton and packed on muscle -- but hes still out there. He now goes by the name Bob Stone and hes obsessed with ""16 Candles"" unicorns -- and Calvin whos pulled a wild spy plot by his old pal. Is Bob a good guy? Or a bad guy? Will Cal man up? All is revealed amid chases and blazing guns (no one ever seems to get killed as it happens) along with a couple uncredited starry cameos. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson play high schoolers who meet again years after attending high school together. (Warner Brothers/Claire Folger) By then youve stopped caring. Even the obligatory blooper reel after the film isnt as funny as it should be. Early in the film Calvin makes a nosedive noise as he tries to create the ""sound of crashing disappointment."" Dwayne Johnson rocking out with various animals as he turns 44 Turns out it sounds like ""Central Intelligence"" -- and looks like it too.

Thats largely because of the charisma of its two leads who wholly embrace the earnest goofiness of Ike Barinholtz and David Stassens (""The Mindy Project"") story about two guys at the opposite ends of the high school hierarchy. Theres more to it than that but at its heart - and yes this movie has a big beating heart - this story centers on a high school prince who grows up to be an ordinary guy (Harts Calvin Joyner) and the overweight outcast who sheds his flab and becomes exceptional (Johnsons Bob Stone) and what they learn from one another. Seriously The movie from ""Were The Millers"" director Rawson Marshall Thurber who also has a script credit opens on a flashback of a 1996 high school pep rally where Calvin offers an act of kindness to his less fortunate classmate when everyone else just sits there and laughs. Cut to 20 years later and ""most likely to succeed"" Calvin is married to his high school girlfriend (Danielle Nicolet) and working as a midlevel accountant whos just been passed over for a promotion that his former assistant gets instead. Its the eve of their high school reunion and hed rather not go at all. Hes feeling a little too average for the ""what are you doing now"" small talk. Thats when Bob comes back into his life. A random friend request from a mysterious fellow who claims to like guns pancakes and unicorns followed by a few enthusiastic Facebook messages lead to the two getting together for drinks. Bob is not the 300-pound pariah anymore. Hes The Rock. And yet despite the exterior upgrade though hes still an affable dweeb at heart rocking a fanny pack jean shorts a unicorn t-shirt. Hes genuinely thrilled to be hanging out with Calvin too. It just so happens that Bob is also a super spy who is on the run from his fellow CIA agents for mysterious reasons. Calvin of course gets entangled in all of this bringing the requisite wide-eyed WTF perspective needed in this sort of over-the-top comedy. Again its the actors who really bring ""Central Intelligence"" home. One of Johnsons great onscreen strengths is that he has a believable softness to him that belies his hard shell even in his more hardcore roles. Here that high-wattage charisma is turned up to 11. Hes almost daring you not to smile along with him. Hart in the straight man role gets to flex some muscles that not many comedies ask of him - relative subtlety. For a man who displays such unwavering confidence most of the time Harts Calvin is like a less depressed Louis C.K. In some past life this might have even been a Steve Martin role. ""Central Intelligence"" also boasts an impressive roster of cameos and bit parts from comedians like ""Silicon Valleys"" Kumail Nanjiani and a few others that I wont spoil here. The plot is pretty silly and not worth much discussion although in its nearly two-hour runtime some scenes drag on interminably and bits start to feel a little repetitive. Thurber should have trimmed some of that fat but he probably didnt want to throw out any even slightly amusing footage of his two superstars. And what didnt make it into the film can probably be found in the blooper reel at the end. Despite its shortcomings ""Central Intelligence"" is a satisfyingly sweet summer distraction that should only improve with time and repeat viewings. ""Central Intelligence"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language.""

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE Running time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence). There must be some bigger way to utilize the sheer likability of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Harness it for green energy? Appoint him ambassador to everything? The action-comedy ""Central Intelligence"" is one of the best vehicles yet for Johnson an uber-alpha male who really seems to relish tapping into his inner 11-year-old girl. ""Im big-time into corns"" says his CIA agent character Bob Stone with his Greek-god torso clad in a sparkly unicorn tee for a meet-up with his old high school friend Calvin (the diminutive Kevin Hart). Its a silly visual juxtaposition in a film built around them but theres such a genuine sweetness to Johnson you cant help digging the shtick. Likewise his partnership with Hart the verbose comedian who plays the yippy Chihuahua to Johnsons affable Great Dane. Its a dynamic (if not exactly original) pairing big and little confidence incarnate and hyperactive ball of anxiety. Their banter sustains this uneven film in which Calvin once the golden boy was the only person to defend then-fat Bob from school bullies. Twenty years later Bob still worships Calvin despite the latters deflation into mid-level accounting and Bobs having become a Bourne-like operative who enlists the very unwilling Calvin to crack computer codes. Too bad ""Central Intelligence"" whose empty title suggests the minimal work put into its plot mires its leads in the vaguest of storylines about purloined spy satellites. Sure no one was expecting Shakespeare but the best action-comedies manage wit even in the midst of mayhem a combo director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Were the Millers"") seems incapable of pulling off. Amy Ryan is a terrific actor stuck in a nothing part as Bobs humorless colleague; a cameo from Aaron Paul serves as a reminder that he needs to stop appending ""bitch"" to his lines. The very brief Melissa McCarthy appearance is a welcome surprise while Jason Bateman is the bully whose long hinted at comeuppance is oddly downplayed. Ultimately its all background noise; were here for the Johnson and Hart show and they deliver. But its the Rock whos the real heart of this film putting a chiseled face on the notion that bullying scars last long after schools out.

"Central Intelligence lacking in well intelligence review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCentral Intelligence lacking in well intelligence review For spy comedy Central Intelligence somebody decided it would be a good idea to put Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart together with the big guy as prankster and the little guy as serious dude. But they forgot the laughs and also the drama.Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart star in the buddy movie Central Intelligence.  (Warner Bros.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 16 2016Central IntelligenceStarring Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart Danielle Nicolet Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. Opens June 17 at GTA theatres. 107 minutes. PGJust a hunch but Im betting the script for Central Intelligence was another of those plug-and-play amusements Hollywood resorts to all too often.Someone decided it would be a good idea to put together Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart with the big guy as prankster and the little guy as serious dude. A generic spy story was dusted off and the lads were slotted in adding scenes where Johnson is manly and Hart is frantic as per usual.Article Continued BelowWhether or not it actually went down like that is beside the point since this committee-written movie plays like factory issue. Johnson and Hart actually do have potential as a comic duo -- better than Ice Cube and Hart in the already stale Ride Along franchise -- but Central Intelligence isnt smart enough to make the most of their pairing.Too silly to be taken as sober espionage drama yet too grim to properly tickle the funny bone and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were the Millers) with artificial exuberance the film exists in the queasy middle ground of unfulfilled expectations. The story such as it is begins in high school in 1996 where Johnsons bullied and humiliated ""Fat Robbie"" and Harts athletic and adored Calvin (a.k.a. ""The Golden Jet"") are evidently on vastly different life journeys. Jump ahead 20 years Robbie is now the man-mountain CIA agent ""Bob Stone"" out saving the world (or something like that) while Calvin is a frustrated accountant fearing an impending high school reunion. Calvins wife Maggie (Daniella Nicolet) a prom queen turned lawyer who is more successful than her hubby seeks marriage counselling.Contrivance will bring Robbie and Calvin together for predictably heroic hijinks along with running jokes about whether Robbie is or isnt really a good guy. (Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul join in the thankless task of attempting to make this potboiler a simmering mystery.) The quirks are similarly calculated Robbie loves unicorns cinnamon pancakes and 16 Candles; Calvin can do back flips except when he cant. All this plus star cameos and curtain-call stunting. The only thing missing is comedy and also drama. Somebody screwed up at the factory.

(Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictures) Dwayne Johnson is so winning in ""Central Intelligence"" that the action comedy is worth a watch despite its familiar buddy-comedy beats. The actors character is unlike any hes played before. He looks the same Hes a colossally muscular CIA agent. But hes also a complete dork. ""Im big-time into corns"" he tells a confused acquaintance while pointing to the unicorn riding a rainbow across his T-shirt above the words ""Always be you."" He wears a fanny pack even to bed and makes ""Twilight"" references. Hes earnest and guileless which may not make for a believable undercover agent but who cares? Its highly entertaining. [Summer Movie Guide Super heroes sequels mutants and more] Johnson plays Bob Stone a super spy who wasnt always so physically intimidating. Back in high school he was overweight with a mouth full of metal but he was no less sincere making him a prime target for bullies. In the flashback opening scene -- during which Johnsons face is impressively superimposed onto someone elses body -- we see a group of kids grab a naked Robbie (as he was called back then) from the locker room and throw him in front of a gymnasium assembly. Everyone dissolves into hysterics except Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) the most popular guy in school. Stricken with pity Calvin takes off his letter jacket and offers it to the tearfully mortified Robbie. Danielle Nicolet left stars as Calvins wife Maggie. (Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictures) Bob turns out to be a CIA Agent and tricks Calvin into helping him on a mission. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Fast-forward a couple of decades and Calvin is dreading his 20th high school reunion. Although he married the prom queen the lovely funny Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) Cal is otherwise embarrassed about his life. The kid most likely to succeed is now a boring accountant. Just then Bob resurfaces. One Facebook friend request later the two men catch up over drinks. The meeting is just a ruse though Bob -- now unrecognizable thanks to his daily multi-hour gym routine -- tricks Calvin into helping him intercept some valuable data from foreign spies and pretty soon the pair is on the run from all kinds of dangerous people including a CIA big shot (Amy Ryan) who believes Bob murdered his last partner. It doesnt take long for the panicky Calvin to start missing his banal former existence. Its refreshing to see the always funny Hart play the straight man for a change. Usually hes the one chewing the scenery and he does some of that here. But ""Central Intelligence"" is really a showcase for the Rock to flex his comedic muscles. Harts job is to react. The jokes are nonstop. Punch lines come so fast theyre hard to catch when the audience is still recovering from the last laugh. No doubt some of this was improvised but the script by Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen is also efficient and light revelling in its broad comedy complete with bathroom humor and pratfalls. The violence meanwhile is more cartoonish than that of recent action comedies which have gotten increasingly brutal. (Think ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Deadpool."") Guns might be involved but rivals end up scratched and bruised instead of bleeding out. The direction by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"" ""Were the Millers"") is more adept at comedy than action. Chase scenes and shootouts get confusing but theres an inspired choice to zero in on Harts face while Johnson spins him around an office in a mail cart which allows the audience to appreciate the actors hilarious facial expressions. The two actors have great chemistry and the movie makes the most of their very different heights. That joke might seem like low-hanging fruit and it is. ""Central Intelligence"" wont win any points for originality but that doesnt make it any less funny. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language. 107 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Warner Bros. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The arithmetic of comedy is not that difficult. If you produce logically linked laughs every five minutes in a feature film you have created a classic. Deliver random chuckles every 10 minutes and your movie is pretty good. Provide the best fun in a pile of outtakes shown in the end credits and you have a zero-momentum mess like ""Central Intelligence."" Its the kind of movie that sends you from the theater smiling because youre glad its over. No need to bother with the paltry excuse for a plot cobbled together by the films four screenwriters. Lets just say that Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart play high school acquaintances rejoining 20 years after graduation to cavort through a thicket of spy nonsense. Johnsons character an obese wallflower in adolescence has toned up to intimidating size but remains a pussycat at heart. Formerly king of the campus Hart has become an office drone. National security agents appear shots are fired the unmatched duo is on the run and an inexplicable running gag involving bananas is milked to exhaustion. Central Intelligence  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language Johnson and Hart are performers of trustworthy charisma but their personal appeal hits its limits when they are recruited to perform in a film that is hard to sit through. ""Central Intelligence"" is a chase movie that goes nowhere but from which theres no escape. Hart plays the stereotypical innocent everyman pulled into an espionage crisis blithering at his hapless best scene after scene and doing tumbledown slapstick but unable to elevate the mindless material. Johnsons character has two very slim dimensions -- is he a steroid-swollen version of the dork he once was or an amoral trickster? But even a physical juggernaut can only force so many gags. There are three funny moments in the film. Two come in the form of microscopic cameos from comic actors of undeniable mystique whose identities should be concealed. When they appear ""Central Intelligence"" quickly and briefly transforms into a solid enjoyment. The other arrives when TV regular Megan Park pops up as a bar-and-grill waitress so enamored of Johnsons bemuscled protein-and-steroids physique that she turns her table service into a blazingly ironic pickup attempt. She lightens up the badly constructed film every moment shes onscreen and when shes gone you wish shed return. Its not in every film you meet a petite asset bigger than The Rock but miracles happen. Unfortunately ""Central Intelligence"" needs lots of miracles. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Photo Claire Folger)Not as bad as youd think actually. Oh the story written partly by director Rawson Marshall Thurber is ridiculous stupid on purpose mostly (one hopes). But Johnson and Hart are kind of likable together a fair number of funny people show up in cameos and there are a couple of laugh-out loud jokes with some real bite a tease of what might have been. (""You remind me of a Black Will Smith."") As with many comedies like this it plays like an extended sketch that goes on too long (almost two hours in fact) when it would have been funnier as a leaner film. But its not out-and-out horrible.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceAnd with that the damning-with-faint-praise department is closed.The story starts 20 years ago when super student and school hero Calvin Joyner (Hart) nicknamed ""The Golden Jet"" receives an award from the fawning principal and is in the middle of delivering a speech when bullies toss an overweight naked kid (Johnson) out in front of the gathered crowd in the gym. Everyone ridicules him but Calvin offers him his varsity jacket.Aaron Paul (left) and Dwayne Johnson are featured in ""Central Intelligence."" (Photo Claire Folger)Cut to the present when Calvin has married his high-school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) a lawyer. Calvin is an accountant but hes unhappy. He feels like hes never lived up to the most likely to succeed expectations of high school where he could do no wrong.The day before the 20th high-school reunion (which Calvin has informed Maggie he will not be attending) Calvin gets a Facebook invitation from someone named Bob Stone. Yes its the overweight naked guy from high school going by a new name. Calvin meets him for a beer and is astonished to learn that the formerly chubby blob now looks like well the Rock.Kevin Hart plays Calvin an accountant in ""Central Intelligence."" (Photo Warner Bros. Picture)Theres more to it than that. Bob who is a kind of overgrown man-boy since the bullying in high school enlists Calvins accountant skills to help unlock some offshore accounts and the next thing you know the CIA is knocking on Calvins door looking for Bob. Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) says Bob is a psychopathic killer a CIA agent gone rogue who murdered his partner. Bob says hes not that he is out to find the real bad guy.The rest of the film is devoted to sorting this all out in the manner that films do -- shoot-outs double-crosses high-speed chases that kind of thing.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestIt doesnt matter really. You dont come to this movie looking for a complex plot. You come to this movie hoping that Johnson and Hart make you laugh. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they dont.

Twenty years later Joyner is an unfulfilled accountant and Weirdicht is ultrabuff CIA agent Bob Stone. Hes also socially bizarre possibly treasonous and completely fixated on Joyner as both friend and savior. Johnson is admirably committed to his characters sincere possibly menacing strangeness but the movie less so. Instead it chooses to rely on Harts extended freakouts over his involvement in an international conspiracy and that conspiracys attendant action setpieces. And the eventual resolution is entirely too neat n tidy in light of the (sometimes funny) crazy that precedes it what began as a dark comedy finishes as a cheerful action drama.

David Ehrlich Jun 16 2016 1153 am davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Central Intelligence"" Nearly (but not quite) redeemed by its good nature and the megaton charisma of its two stars ""Central Intelligence"" is a dopey blockbuster diversion that will surely keep United Airlines passengers entertained during the dog days of summer. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"" ""Were the Millers"") and shot with the safety on at all times this unambitious buddy comedy has all the biting wit and visual flair of a movie that already seems resigned to its final resting place on the tiny airplane screens where it will be interred. And yet ""Central Intelligence"" knows something that audiences will be delighted to learn -- or more likely rediscover -- for themselves Dwayne Johnson is a fucking national treasure. Our story eerily similar to that of Adam Sandlers recent Netflix disaster ""The Do-Over"" begins all the way back in a magical time known as 1996. An obese teenager named Robbie Weirdicht (Johnson his face plastered on to the body of an obese teenager as the result of the sophisticated uglification technology that allowed Brad Pitt to be an elderly dwarf in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") stands alone in his high schools locker room showers butt-naked and belting out his very own version of En Vogues 1992 pop masterpiece ""My Lovin (Youre Never Gonna Get It)"" which was definitely picked for its cultural specificity and extraordinary comedic value and not because it was the first thing that Thurber received clearance to use. Meanwhile in the packed gymnasium outside the locker room prom king Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) is enjoying the last of his glory days at the head of a pep rally for the graduating class. Alas his ""follow your dreams"" speech interrupted by a pack of sniveling bullies who heave Robbies naked body onto the hardwood basketball court floor for the entire school to see. Sure thats probably a serious criminal misdemeanor in the eyes of ""the law"" or whatever but boys will be boys. Calvin a mensch to the core rushes to help cover him up. READ MORE Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson May Star in Jumanji Remake Cut to 20 years later Calvin is a mid-level accountant whos disappointed with his life while Robbie -- now going by the name Bob Stone -- has evolved into a rippling half-Samoan demi-god whos strong enough to carry an entire movie on his back. And yet despite undergoing the most ridiculous physical transformation this side of Captain America Bob is still a total doofus. Reuniting with Calvin at a local bar on the eve of their class reunion Bob shows up rocking a fanny pack and a skin-tight t-shirt with a unicorn emblazoned across the chest. Viewers familiar with ""Pain amp; Gain"" know that Johnson is at his best (and most infectiously self-amused) when playing against type and he seems to be having the time of his life as he belittles his co-star into playing the straight man. Of course theres more to this story -- the artist formerly known as ""The Rock"" wouldnt just be a run-of-the-mill dweeb. Were talking about Hercules. Were talking about the Scorpion King. Were talking about a guy who fought an earthquake in last summers ""San Andreas"" and made that motherfucker apologize for every inch of its fault line. In other words Calvin is the only one whos even the least bit surprised when it turns out that Bob is a rogue possibly psychotic C.I.A. agent whos on the run from his boss (a thankless Amy Ryan) with a MacGuffin. ""Youre Jason Bourne in jorts"" yelps Hart in one of his few memorable lines. Calvin is the only guy Bob trusts (the movie is sweet like that) and the two get wrapped up in an explosively stupid adventure that -- thanks to a tight 50 million budget and the fact that Thurber directs with all the visual panache of a McDonalds commercial -- often feels less like Jason Bourne than it does Agent Cody Banks. Fortunately Thurber seems to have embraced his various limitations and ""Central Intelligence"" doesnt strain towards being a full-throated action-comedy. In fact its few shootouts and car crashes are so half-assed that the movie occasionally feels like a deliberate throwback to the middle-brow studio fare of the 80s and 90s which feels somewhat appropriate given that Hard and Johnsons archetype-based chemistry is pretty much just ""Twins"" all over again. The laughs are often just as limp particularly because Hart doesnt appear to be super comfortable with the idea that hes there to tee-up jokes for his co-star. In the ""Ride Along"" movies he and Ice Cube were a united front of unfunniness; here Hart is just nipping at Johnsons heels. Calvins default mode is ""scared shitless"" and while the character serves a necessary function he could pretty much be played by anyone (brilliant cameos from the likes of Jason Bateman and Kumail Nanjiani further emphasize how few of the one-liners land when Hart is left to deliver them). Perhaps the problem is that Hart no longer needs to be anyones foil -- hes excellently empathetic in the more dramatic moments when hes struggling to become the hero of his own story and the film leaves us with reason to believe that Johnson isnt the only one who should continue to subvert his image. And Johnson good as he is should only go further around the bend from here. For all the fun hes having hes only truly electric in the moments when Thurber entertains the possibility that Bob might be a delusional psychopath whos just flown over the cuckoos nest. With a tepid studio offering like this in which themes include such bold ideas as ""bullies are bad"" ""guns are fun"" and ""all those haters from high school would worship you if you werent so fat"" theres no hope that Johnson might dive off the deep end and create something special. And yet between ""Central Intelligence"" and ""Pain amp; Gain"" theres reason to believe that hell get there one day -- its still too soon to smell what the Rock is cooking but you can feel him firing up the grill. Grade C+ ""Central Intelligence"" opens in theaters on Friday.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were The Millers Dodgeball A True Underdog Story) whose style seems to consist of saying ""more"" and ""cut"" makes the least of a decent premise and appealing cast in Central Intelligence a shambolic high-concept farce that doubles as a cautionary tale of where studio comedies go wrong. In spots as indifferent and self-indulgent as any latter-day Adam Sandler production (complete with Sandler-esque marriage counseling subplot and teenage humiliation backstory) it switches back and forth from snail-paced to incoherently over-stuffed on a moments notice with no in-between mode. That it manages to score a good laugh every couple of minutes is mostly a credit to stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart who make for a better mismatched-buddy comic duo than the movie probably deserves. Toning down his motormouthed shtick for the first act Hart stars as Calvin Joyner a meek accountant who used to be the coolest and most popular kid at Central High. Anxious about his upcoming high-school reunion Calvin gets an out-of-the-blue Facebook message from Robbie Weirdicht the overweight class laughing stock he hasnt seen in 20 years. Weirdicht (Johnson) now known as ""Bob Stone"" has grown up to be a rogue CIA super-agent though he still idolizes Calvin for being the only kid at school who was ever kind to him. Through a series of a head-scratching plot holes he ropes Calvin into a plan to evade his former boss (Amy Ryan looking lost) clear his name and discover the identity of an arms trafficker named The Black Badger--all in time for the aforementioned reunion of course. As in Thurbers last movie Were The Millers there are hints of a much darker (and better) comedy buried throughout; a throwaway moment even suggests that Bob--who rides around on the same motorcycle Calvin had in school--might be manipulating the former prom kings over-inflated sense of his teenage glory days for his own gain. But instead of pursuing that angle Central Intelligence opts for everybody-learns-a-life-lesson schmaltz and the kind of listless feature-length-gag-reel vamping thats become a common viewer hazard ever since Hollywood convinced itself that anyone can direct improv. The casts energy level jumps from shot to shot and once the chases and stunts (both pretty bad) start Hart starts veering randomly from fidgety button-down everyman to a heartbeat away from shouting ""Laaady"" in his shrillest Jerry Lewis voice. Aside from an uncredited Jason Bateman who gets a smarmy bit role as Bobs childhood bully nobody seems to be playing a consistent character. Given that the movies bungled sporadic plotting ends up making less sense than a Now You See Me movie thats a minor problem. (Plus Johnsons beaming confidence works whether hes playing Bob as a globetrotting badass in awe of his own cool or a muscled superman with the mind and fashion sense of a painfully awkward teen.) But even when the actors manage to get on the same page they still risk being disrupted by Thurbers careless and occasionally perplexing direction and pacing. He even manages to mess up a surefire ""20 years later"" gag by inserting an inexplicably long opening title card sequence that looks like it was made for a community-college motion graphics class.

June 15 2016 | 0859PM PT Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart team up for a spy-game action comedy that could have used less fake intrigue and more laughs. The words ""action comedy"" go together not just because the movies they describe combine action and comedy. They go together because in a machine-tooled lark like ""Central Intelligence"" each one becomes the other. The dialogue as quick and aggressive as a punch to the face really is a form of action; the gun battles car crashes and hurtling bodies are staged with a more-mayhem-the-better lightness that turns violence into something to giggle at as if it were all transpiring in a Road Runner cartoon. At least thats the idea. In ""Central Intelligence"" when Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) a mild-mannered accountant coerced into becoming the partner of a rogue CIA agent jabbers on for the opening act or two about how he wants nothing at all to do with this scheme (""Im not in"" he keeps wailing; he just wants out) Hart lets his voice creep up into high Eddie Murphy dudgeon and the words tumble out so fast that it almost stops mattering what hes saying. Its the comedy of controlled hysteria -- the verbal equivalent of madly flailing fists. And when Dwayne Johnson as the agent in question gets out of a jam by slamming some guys head with an office refrigerator door setting off water sprinklers and a smoke bomb and pushing a mail cart (that contains Kevin Hart) through the plate-glass window of what must be the 20th floor its all just a joke slapstick with extra pain. Of course the downside of the action-comedy recipe is that it risks having almost no consequence. The danger of the form is that action and comedy instead of adding something to one another just cancel each other out. Thats sort of what happens in ""Central Intelligence"" though you couldnt accuse the movie of not hurtling along. It delivers -- on some basic giddy turn-off-your-frontal-lobes level. Its an action-comedy utensil like ""Rush Hour"" crossed with an old Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up with a few goofy added sprinkles of ""Romy and Micheles High School Reunion."" Its the sort of movie that in its highly formulaic way reveals a lot about what audiences are seeking today. A scabrous buddy comedy like ""The Nice Guys"" appeared to have a lot going for it but it didnt have the right action-to-comedy ratio (there wasnt a spatter of gunfire every eight minutes) and the characters were a tad too quirky for the genre. ""Central Intelligence"" goes back to basics Kevin Hart as talented a funnyman as he is squawks and rails and goes scaredy-cat on cue while Dwayne Johnson as the undercover agent plays a pumped-up friendly giant whos too sensitive for his own good. The joke of both characters is right on the surface and it stays there for an hour and 45 minutes. The movie in other words serves up just enough of the standard microwaved meat and potatoes of action comedy to have the potential to be a medium-size hit. The opening flashback strikes the films only note of over-the-top nuttiness In a high school gym in 1996 we see Johnsons Robbie Weirdicht as the blobby loser he was -- a dork who looks like Rob Schneider in a fat suit and who gets humiliated by being tossed naked into the middle of a year-end pep rally. Calvin the class superstar is the only one who doesnt laugh at him and twenty years later Robbie -- now under the pseudonym Bob Stone -- contacts him on Facebook and arranges a reunion. As Calvin discovers Bob after twenty years of six-hour-a-day workouts now looks like Dwayne Johnson but hes the same girly-man inside (sort of). He prizes hugs and unicorns his favorite movie is ""Sixteen Candles"" and whenever the subject of high school comes up he looks like he wants to crawl under a desk. But of course hes also a tattooed bruiser who will kick the butt of anyone he has to especially bullies. Johnson draws as much as he ever has on his ironic courtliness -- the side of him that doesnt just look like Barack Obama on hulk serum but talks like Obama with the articulate civility that has made Johnson into a gently disarming screen star. Bob gets tough when he needs to but hes always much sweeter than we expect and in ""Central Intelligence"" thats Johnsons version of the Schwarzenegger shuffle. Hart is a good match for him but he doesnt get enough good lines. After a fight when he says to Bob ""You were like Jason Bourne man -- but with jorts"" the moment has a snap to it. But though his delivery is ace hardly any of Harts dialogue surprises you; its mostly rote fear and ranting. Theres a halfway funny scene in which Bob pretends to be a couples therapist who keeps slapping Calvin and Jason Bateman in an unbilled cameo as Bobs old high-school tormentor has a stylish nastiness that momentarily steals the movie out from under the two stars. Its enough to make you wish that ""Central Intelligence"" didnt turn into a kind of straight-up thriller mostly out of laziness. Its easier to do variations on the same old cloak-and-dagger crapola than it is to elevate horn-locking irritability into true banter. Bob is out to nail the Black Badger a mystery agent who it seems has murdered his partner and plans to sell U.S. satellite encryption codes to the highest bidder. But Bobs boss played with brusquely appealing heartlessness by Amy Ryan thinks that Bob is the Black Badger and the way this plays out is just competent enough on a spy-game level to make you momentarily forget that you didnt buy a ticket to ""Central Intelligence"" to watch a third-rate Bourne film in jorts. You bought that ticket to laugh. You will not do it quite enough. Film Review Central IntelligenceReviewed at Regal Cinemas E-Walk New York June 15 2016. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 107 MIN.

TWITTER 6/17/2016 Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart headline Rawson Marshall Thurbers odd-couple comedy about two high-school acquaintances who end up on the run from the CIA. The bar for studio comedies has sunk so low that when one comes along and doesnt bludgeon you with its ineptness theres a temptation to lavish praise on it. With that in mind moviegoers looking for a quick fix of summer escapism could do worse than Central Intelligence in which an enjoyably matched Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson star as odd-couple partners in CIA hijinks. Fast funny-ish and moderately entertaining the film also is notable for what it spares us There are no penis jokes; no gags involving farts diarrhea or projectile vomit (not that Im categorically opposed to those); no faces getting smashed with basketballs or other flying objects; no shouty kids scolding wives or scantily clad sexpots; and only one brief slow-mo shot of the leads strutting toward the camera in smart suits as rap plays on the soundtrack. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Were the Millers Dodgeball) from a screenplay written with Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen (The Mindy Project) Central Intelligence demonstrates an above-average interest in story and character and tries if not always successfully to craft real comic situations and action sequences. Its been made with a certain level of polish and professionalism. And it capitalizes on the chemistry between Hart and Johnson who convey what seems like genuine delight in each others company -- something that gives this bromantic diversion a giddy kick. I dont want to overstate the case. The film doesnt come close to the heady high/low-brow brew of last summers exemplary espionage spoof Spy. Nor does it deserve to be cited in the same breath as seminal buddy movies like 48 Hrs. or even the irresistible 21 Jump Street reboot. But in a season of particularly joyless tentpole offerings Central Intelligence is at least a breezy watch and -- whatever its shortcomings -- doesnt reek of the utter cant-be-bothered laziness that has become the damning hallmark of the Hollywood comedy. The movie opens to the harmonies of En Vogues ""My Lovin (Youre Never Gonna Get It)"" -- still glorious after all these years -- as Robbie a hefty Maryland high-schooler busts a move in the locker-room shower. When he turns to the camera we see that Robbie is actually Johnson fattened up via CG trickery in the films most conspicuous bit of lowest-common-denominator laugh baiting. Before we can fully appreciate the inanity of this setup Robbie is being dragged away by bullies and thrown naked into the middle of a school assembly. Luckily his classmate Calvin (Hart) a popular and kind-hearted jock is there to hand Robbie his jacket so he can cover up. Cut to 20 years later and Calvins golden-boy shine has faded. Hes happily married to his high-school sweetheart (a sharp if underused Danielle Nicolet) but hes bored with his accounting job and hits peak frustration when hes passed over for a promotion (or a ""promosh"" as a smarmy co-worker played by the scene-stealing Ryan Hansen calls it). One day Calvin reconnects with Robbie -- who now goes by Bob -- over Facebook and meets him for a drink. Lo and behold the overweight sad sack has blossomed into an impressive specimen of beefcake (Johnson sans fat effects) and still idolizes Calvin for that moment of kindness back in the day. After a few beers some bonding (""Im a hugger"" the goofily effusive Bob notes clasping a helpless Calvin to his chiseled chest) and a bar brawl that reveals Bobs formidable fighting skills Bob cryptically tells Calvin that he needs accounting help. But the next day a CIA bigwig (the always welcome Amy Ryan) shows up on Calvins doorstep claiming that Bob is in fact a former agent gone rogue -- and turned psycho -- after killing his partner. A few beats later Calvin and Bob are holed up in Calvins office a law enforcement team on the other side of the door waiting to pounce. Their escape with Bob wheeling a hysterical Calvin around in a mail bin while calmly dispensing with adversaries is the movies highlight an example of how Central Intelligence at its best weaves its action and comedy elements -- the shattering of glass and crunch of bones punctuating the stars banter -- into a high-velocity whole. From there the plot thickens with lots of talk about encryption codes and the ""black badger"" (the CIA agent Bob claims is the real villain) as well as extended cameos from Aaron Paul Jason Bateman and a certain uncredited comedy queen. Thurber and the screenwriters have fun staging three different flashbacks of the same contested event providing further evidence that the film is a notch more narratively alert than many others of its ilk. That said no ones coming to Central Intelligence to see the director riff on Rashomon; theyre coming to see Johnson sausaged into Harts pajamas (dont ask) the two stars staring dewily into each others eyes as part of a couples therapy intimacy exercise (again dont ask) or Johnson kicking butt while Hart fusses at his side like a Chihuahua nipping at the heels of a Rottweiler. Im not sure the visual juxtaposition inherent in the central pairing is as amusing as the filmmakers think (Twins Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito spoiled us for life in that department). And the ""role reversal"" the movies marketers have been pushing is a stretch Calvin may register as the ""straight man"" on the page but Hart plays him at his usual manic endearingly irascible pitch; Bob is nerdy and neurotic on the surface but put a gun in his hand and an enemy in his way and hes every bit the cool charismatic Johnson weve seen in HBOs Ballers San Andreas and other films over the years. Still Harts shtick feels more focused and finely tuned here than in the slapdash Ride Along movies or last years dismal The Wedding Ringer and its a tribute to Johnsons growing versatility that hes credible as a man who could be either a cold-blooded killer or a lovable lug. The dialogue in Central Intelligence is hit-or-miss but there are chuckle-worthy touches throughout including a photo of a teenage Calvin as Hamlet in the school play and a recurring gag in which Ryans CIA agent nonchalantly tazes Hansens corporate kiss-ass (an example of the right way to wring giggles out of violence). The films anti-bullying message is obvious but never drags on the pace or tone. Moreover that message and the mindless laughs that Central Intelligence serves up along with it are things we could use now more than ever. Distributor Warner Bros.

EntertainmentMovies Central Intelligence Smart idea that goes awry Originally published June 16 2016 at 1201 am Updated June 17 2016 at 634 pm Dwayne Johnson top and Kevin Hart play high-school classmates who reunite and have an adventure in ""Central Intelligence."" (Claire Folger/Claire Folger) Movie review of ""Central Intelligence"" Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson team up for an uneven comedy about high-school classmates who reunite amid a top-secret CIA case. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Sometimes matches seemingly made in heaven end up somewhere closer to hell. Whoever thought up the idea of pairing Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart for a crime/caper/comedy was right on the money The blend of Johnsons laid-back hero-dudeness and Harts whippet-fast comic timing should have been good fun. But somebody alas had an idea though not a good one Make Johnson the comedian and Hart the straight man. The result is kind of like having ice cream for dinner and steak for dessert -- it seems like it might work but it doesnt. Hart his rat-a-tat-banter kept to a minimum plays Calvin a former high-school hero whos now a mild-mannered accountant. Johnson decked out in unicorn T-shirt (stretched to the max) and fanny pack is Bob a former high-school nerd who now according to an impressed Calvin ""looks like Hercules."" The two reconnect 20 years after graduation when Bob needs Calvins help with numbers on a top-secret case Bob it turns out is a CIA operative trying to save the world. Various antics ensue involving cars guns and Bobs uncanny way of disappearing and reappearing like hes a rabbit under a very big hat. Movie Review    Central Intelligence with Dwayne Johnson Kevin Hart Amy Ryan Aaron Paul Danielle Nicolet. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber from a screenplay by Ike Barinholtz David Stassen and Thurber. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude and suggestive humor some nudity action violence and brief strong language. Several theaters. The two men are likable and make a funny sight gag together (about a foot separates them in height) particularly in a shot where Johnson cradles Hart in his massive arms with the smaller man looking like a terrified baby. And Hart finds a few moments to jump out of the straight-man box particularly his panicked but precise delivery of the line ""Are you quite well?"" But the screenplays a disjointed mess the humors all over the map (do we really need another movie in which an overweight nude body is used as an endless visual joke?) and even the sudden arrival of a boa constrictor named Snake Gyllenhaal cant save things. Somebody get these two -- and that snake -- a better script. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Heres definitive proof that a single performance can make an entire film. The premise of Central Intelligence is simplistic and underwhelming a former high school star turned jobsworth accountant teams up with former bullying victim turned CIA agent to take down a terrorist mastermind. The script is equally lazy and leading man Kevin Hart as the office drone offers his usual tiresome overcooked LOOK AT ME IM BEING FUNNY schtick. So thank the movie gods for Dwayne Johnson who delivers a performance of such charm such unexpected goofiness that the screen practically glows every time he appears. It doesnt begin well we first meet Johnson in a creepy CG-enhanced fatsuit as a chubby teenage nerd Robbie whose horrible high school experience is relieved only by the kindness of Calvin (Hart) football hero and student-most-likely-to-succeed. But 20 years later its a different story Calvin is washed up and bored with his dead-end life while Robbie has become a globetrotting superspy with a fetish for unicorns. Theres literally nothing unloveable about Johnsons performance hitting a perfect balance point somewhere between traumatised adolescent unbreakable superhero and overexcited man-child (think a peak-form John Candy trapped in the body of well The Rock). And even more impressively he makes it all look completely effortless breezing through the movie while Hart jumps frantically up and down and stuff explodes pointlessly in the background.

Cameos were fun movie references were fun the movie is not funny. Its watchable but I found it uncomfortably not funny.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore5 days agocharlotte_sometimestastemakerFeaturedA surprisingly hilarious Summer comedyCentral Intelligence does not try to reinvent the wheel it has the typical rhythms and beats of a Summer buddy-movie but this is not a bad thing. Though it may have the cliches and lazy set-up it is a genuinely hilarious movie that works far better than youd expect. Plus some unexpected and on point Sixteen Candles references for the 80s movie connoisseurs among us (as in I started cry-laughing at one point..)In terms of storyline this film will not win awards for originality the school reunion as a concept is an overused plot point. As is the wrong man story arc. As is the generic misunderstandings and bland gunplay that occurs as a result. And yet in terms of execution Central Intelligence does an excellent job of standing out from the rest of the crowd. Itwill surprise you. It will make you laugh more than youd think and has a lovely feel good message. Plus for a mainstream Hollywood comedy it has a superb amount of oddness that makes it something of a rarity. Unpredictably delightful.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore13 days agoLeahTastemakerFeaturedFull disclosure - I love The Rock. Every film Ive seen Dwayne Johnson in is essentially a montage of him doing macho things jumping out of 20 story windows (why not) beating up multiple tough guys (of course) flying a plane (everyone can do that right?). Its a solid formula. In keeping with tradition this movie delivers all of that action on top of a genuinely funny script. Kevin Hart added an extra kick as the reluctant sidekick and having seen some of his stand-up before I was glad he was able to translate that presence onto to the big screen. Hey its not going to win any Oscars but I loved every minute of it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 10 2016Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedI love the Rock. Yup. I said it. I absolutely adore him. I think hes funny and charming and quite possibly the nicest wardrobe sized man Ive ever seen heard amp; watched. Seriously look up affable genial or likable in the dictionary and I swear therell be a picture of this Californian muscle mountain beaming out at you from underneath all of those words. This means that not only did I really enjoy San Andreas Im also actively anticipating Baywatch and I was full steam ahead ready to watch Central Intelligence...I know Im a movie snob with a hidden centre of pure cheeseCentral Intelligence is without doubt the perfect film to watch if youre so tired that you have no capacity for intellectual thought and thats not a slight I promise. Its good fun with a colour-by-numbers but above averagely written script from the team behind The Mindy Project and Dodgeball among others...that should give you an idea of the level were talking but dont let it put you off. It might be predictable but its also pretty sweet. Top dog in high school Calvin Joyner is now stagnating in an accountancy job while incessantly bullied Bob Stone is now working for the CIA and in dire need of help from someone good with numbers...see where were going yet?As Calvin Kevin Hart is great. Sure hes manic and a bit squealy at times but not to the point where youll want to bury your face in your bag of picknmix to escape hearing him...that is my preferred viewing stance for any Adam Sandler film I have the misfortune to find myself watching by the way. A solid cast easily supports the two leads with Amy Ryan Aaron Paul amp; Jason Bateman delivering watchable performances but make no mistake this is Johnsons film. His comic timing is pure gold and his partnership with the diminutive Hart is hilarious; neither attempts to be the star and both allow each other every opportunity to shine. Unicorn t-shirts Molly Ringwald a love for En Vogue...Johnson is uninhibited goofy and absolutely charming from the opening scene to the final reel - make sure you stay for the end credits too because this is a film that delivers exactly what audiences want and that includes the not-often-seen-anymore blooper reel.Is this film gonna set the world on fire? No. Is it gonna be on ballot papers come awards season? Probably not. Is it ninety minutes of action comedy with a positive message at its core about being true to who you are? Yes and thats more than enough for me. Now if youll excuse me Im off to wait for my first Dwayne The Rock Johnson fan club newsletter...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 7 2016Kirsty StastemakerFeaturedGenuine chemistry between Johnson and Hart make this film unmissable. There is not a single minute when you are not giggling away.The film gets a bit slow towards the end but it is very funny original and full of characterHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/central-intelligence,200,centralintelligence35,centralintelligence,timeout
