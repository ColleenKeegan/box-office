Paramount hide caption toggle caption Paramount Film critic Bob Mondello offers his opinion on the new movie Elizabethtown. Director Cameron Crowes romantic comedy set in Elizabethtown Ky. stars Kirsten Dunst Orlando Bloom and a large supporting cast. ROBERT SIEGEL host The film ""Elizabethtown"" would appear to have a lot going for it. It stars Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst who have starred separately in such popular hits as ""Lord of the Rings"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Spider-Man."" And its directed by Cameron Crowe who wrote and directed such romances as ""Say Anything"" and ""Jerry Maguire."" So a lot of people have been looking forward to ""Elizabethtown"" including our own Bob Mondello. BOB MONDELLO reporting The first words out of Orlando Blooms mouth are `As somebody once said theres a difference between a failure and a fiasco. Now I dont mean to be a pain about this but I dont think anyone once said that except maybe over coffee. This being a new romantic comedy from the guy who made ""Jerry Maguire"" I really wanted to say the movie had me at hello but it more or less had me arguing with it at hello and it keeps saying hello as if Drew and Claire the characters played by Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst will be more interesting if they dont get to know each other. They first meet on a plane as hes headed for his fathers funeral. Hes just lost his job as a shoe designer the failure or fiasco he was referring to and she is the flight attendant who simply will not leave him alone. (Soundbite of ""Elizabethtown"") Ms. KIRSTEN DUNST (As Claire) Louisville Kentucky huh? Mr. ORLANDO BLOOM (As Drew) Actually hes near Louisville (pronounced loo-ee-vil). Ms. DUNST (As Claire) Louisville (pronounced loo-i-vul). Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) Louisville (pronounced loo-la-vil). Ms. DUNST (As Claire) Vul. Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) Louis... Ms. DUNST (As Claire) Vul. Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) Hes in Elizabethtown. MONDELLO This is known in Hollywood as meeting cute and the director enjoyed it so much that he has them meet cute again on the phone. (Soundbite of ""Elizabethtown"") Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) Hello. Ms. DUNST (As Claire) Hello stranger. Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) I just wanted to call you and thank you. So you know goodbye thank you and... Ms. DUNST (As Claire) Ill hold. Mr. BLOOM (As Drew) OK. MONDELLO And they meet cute again as the call turns into an all-night marathon and again after they drive to see each other at dawn and then they separate so they can meet cute again at Drews hotel which they do a couple of times actually. All of this with Drews family tragedy in the background his fathers funeral and that other shoe tragedy thing. (Soundbite of ""Elizabethtown"") Ms. DUNST (As Claire) All right you really failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You--you think I care about that? MONDELLO No but the problem is that its hard for us to care either partly because the shoe failure is a dumb plot device. Drew supposedly designed a sneaker that lost the shoe company a billion dollars. Now excuse me this is his fault? They dont do market research? But even if you pretend it does make sense youll soon be questioning other things like the whimsical funeral arrangements for dad which include a tap dance and a rock concert or what it is that director Cameron Crowe thinks is so funny about cell phones or when he thinks Claire has had time to put together 41 hours of carefully chosen music for a road trip she plans for Drew. In fact by the time theyre meeting cute on the road trip you may even be wondering what the attraction is between these two. I mean hes dull and shes annoying but is that really enough to make sparks fly? It would not have been enough in Cameron Crowes earlier movies. He has a reputation for meticulous research and getting emotions right. He famously re-enrolled in high school before writing ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and he made ""Almost Famous"" about his own experiences as a teen-age rock critic. ""Elizabethtown"" is also supposed to be based on his own life but it feels as if he filmed his first draft without bothering to make things funny or touching or well interesting really. He did however helpfully include lots of death and disaster and getting lost metaphors making it almost too easy for folks who want to mock his film. Lets not stoop to the failure vs. fiasco imagery here but I will note that Claire says early on that the roads to Elizabethtown... (Soundbite of ""Elizabethtown"") Ms. DUNST (As Claire) ...are hopelessly and gloriously confusing. MONDELLO And as an epitaph for the movie well as somebody once said `If the shoe fits.

Comments Elizabethtown Cameron Crowes latest feature screened at the Toronto film festival as a bloated 135-minute work in progress; hes since trimmed it to 117 but its still an especially lame variation on his feel-good formula. Bland Orlando Bloom plays a rising young designer at a west-coast sneaker company whose new shoe has made a disastrous debut; after his father dies while visiting relatives his mother (Susan Sarandon) dispatches him to the title Kentucky town to take charge of the body. The heros nuclear family and kooky rural relatives are so sketchily conceived that none of the intended comedy works and the balance of the movie is given over to one of Crowes sugary romances between Bloom and a delectable flight attendant (Kirsten Dunst whos not given a character so much as served in a martini glass).

It saddened me because I realized watching the film the second time around how much I was hoping that Crowe would have pulled it off. ""Elizabethtown"" screened last month at the Toronto International Film Festival in a version that felt overlong and badly unfocused -- it told too many stories none of them well. Before last weeks screening word was that hed cut 18 minutes out. Alas it didnt help. And that hurts because Crowe is that rarity a talented filmmaker unafraid to show the warmth of his heart. In his best films (for me ""Say Anything"" and ""Almost Famous"") a genuine sweetness and generosity of spirit permeates drawing us close to the characters and investing us in their fates. And hes shown an uncanny eye for iconic images often with music John Cusack holding that boom box his chin clenched and his eyes steady outside the window of his true love in ""Say Anything;"" Kate Hudsons sweet lost Penny Lane whirling in the dust of an empty ballroom in ""Almost Famous."" ""Elizabethtown"" has plenty of glimpses of Crowes trademark warmth; the problem is that theyre not channeled into a coherent narrative. The first 20 minutes or so are quite promising Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) has just experienced a colossal business failure spearheading a new shoe at a Nike-like company that has gone wrong. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Elizabethtown"" with Orlando Bloom Kirsten Dunst Susan Sarandon Alec Baldwin Bruce McGill Judy Greer Jessica Biel. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual references. Several theaters. His boss (Alec Baldwin) tells him that he has lost the company 972 million. While hes at home contemplating suicide his sister calls sobbing Their father has died while visiting family in Kentucky and Drew must go bring the body home. Here the story changes and the movie veers off course. Drews business failure is more or less abandoned and ""Elizabethtown"" branches off into two other stories Drews chatty romance with a bubbly flight attendant (Kirsten Dunst) and his gradual orientation into his new Southern family. Other subplots pour in Drews mothers (Susan Sarandon) obsession with activity to quench her grief; his cousins (Paul Schneider) inability to control his young son. Crowes customary rock soundtrack becomes oppressive Were given story after story. And a road trip at the end with reverent stops at American monuments is ill-timed and excessive. Bloom (doing a perfect American accent) and Dunst make a charming couple and Crowe as always shows a careful sense of atmosphere; the movie nicely conveys that disorienting feeling of staying at a hotel where everyone else is part of a big party. But its as if after veering away from familiar territory with the thriller ""Vanilla Sky"" (an interesting attempt that deserved more praise than it got) hes returning to a greatest-hits format reprising themes and even scenes from his previous movies. (Dunsts spacey/wise character in particular is reminiscent of Hudsons in ""Almost Famous."") ""Elizabethtown"" isnt a fiasco on the scale of Drews but its definitely a big disappointment. Crowes capable of much better than this; lets hope he gets back on track with the next one.

Bloom (if ever there was a actor who doesnt deserve his status...) is a successful twenty-something workaholic trainer designer who loses his job in spectacular fashion. This personal calamity - hence the near-suicide - coincides with the death of Blooms distant father so prompting an unwelcome journey to Kentucky and a reunion with his distant fathers colourful Southern clan. A chance meeting en route with a pretty air hostess (Dunst) marks the beginning of Blooms re-entry to normal life and his realisation that theres more to life than work (how sage). Male wish-fulfilment drives the entire project not least its concerns with grief (why couldnt I love my father when he was alive) and love (why cant all pretty air-hostesses realise how warm and sensitive I am - and sleep with me). A long and rambling film the sentiment just keeps on flowing...

"Elizabethtown Way South of Garden State washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Elizabethtown Way South of Garden State Kirsten Dunst left pursues Orlando Bloom in the romantic comedy ""Elizabethtown."" (By Neal Preston -- Paramount Pictures Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 14 2005 To swallow ""Elizabethtown"" without experiencing a sharp tummy cramp of disbelief you have to accept Orlando Bloom as a tormented soul. Why the boy is so emotionally hobbled he cant respond to the blond uber-adorable Kirsten Dunst. Lets delve into Orlandos pain shall we? Hes Drew Baylor a shoe designer from Oregon whose latest creation has incurred company losses of close to 1 billion and led to his firing. Despondent he drives home and seats himself on a Rube Goldbergian suicide device -- an exercycle with a mounted dagger rigged to stab the rider. All one has to do is pedal furiously. This is not what your fitness instructor means by negative gain. This is exactly when the phone rings. No its not Blooms agent telling him to leave the set before his career implodes its Drews sister Heather (Judy Greer) who informs Drew that their father Mitchell has passed away. It happened while he was visiting his old friends and relatives in Elizabethtown Ky. Heather says Drews mother Hollie (Susan Sarandon) would like her son to fly to Elizabethtown cremate Mitch and bring his ashes home to Oregon. It would help too if he made nice with the Kentucky kin; theyre still mad at Hollie for stealing Mitch away oh 20 years ago. So Drew is off the suicide machine and onto the plane to Kentucky. Enter Dunst as Claire a flight attendant who judging by her wide grin seems to be lying in wait for him. Drews the only passenger on this flight (like that ever happens) which gives her time to talk to Drew about her obsession with the mystique of names the best way to drive to Elizabethtown and most importantly the road map to her big home-fried heart. Drew still mopey about the shoe catastrophe and thinking about his Elizabethtown mission isnt responsive at first. But not long after he meets his fathers people and checks into a hotel loneliness sets in. He reaches for the phone number Claire left him and . . . oh you know. Writer-director Cameron Crowes most recent stumble ""Vanilla Sky"" continues without interruption into ""Elizabethtown."" Its hard to believe the creative mind that gave us ""Almost Famous"" ""Jerry Maguire"" ""Say Anything"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" looked up with satisfaction after typing 117 pages of this. Speaking of killer exercycles ""Elizabethtown"" comes across as little more than repedaled ""Garden State."" In both films a prodigal son of sorts returns to the old home state because of the death of a parent gets caught up in a world of offbeat characters and is ultimately saved by the love of an eccentric young woman. The crucial difference? ""Garden State"" was a good movie. Writer-director Zach Braff made an appealing returning son and Natalie Portman was a charm as his nutballish savior. You really believed she could redeem souls. The locals (from New Jersey) were wonderfully memorable Remember Peter Saarsgard as the gravedigger who steals necklaces from the dead? In ""Elizabethtown"" the Kentucky contingent including Aunt Dora (Paula Deen) Uncle Dale (Loudon Wainwright III) cousin Bill (Bruce McGill) and Lynyrd Skynrd cover band singer Jessie (Paul Schneider) practically carries the word ""zany"" aloft on billboards. The movies best shot at wild-card endearment comes from Sarandons Hollie who makes the trip to Elizabethtown to deliver a heartfelt speech about Mitch. Her intended showstopper is a brand new tap-dance shuffle -- to ""Moon River"" -- and she brings the house down but only because the actors were paid to applaud. Blooms inability to convey convincing emotion is manifest; if he has any allure in this movie its got to be the hair gel. Dunst is an appealing presence in most movies but here shes reduced to a strangely ethereal stalker. Shes always appearing behind him and eventually he becomes happy to see her but the phrase ""restraining order"" comes to mind. For all the time she and Bloom spend together there is surprisingly little magic -- just the surface appeal of two attractive people making (or almost making) kissy face. The deepest banter exchanged between them in fact comes at the end of a mammoth cell-phone conversation. ""Should we hang up now?"" Claire asks. Definitely. Elizabethtown (117 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity and some sexual references.

"In `Elizabethtown love Blooms despite the saccharine - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Dad In `Elizabethtown love Blooms despite the saccharinemovies - reviewOctober 14 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticElizabethtown is a family-reunion potluck where the diners get distracted by the dessert table. This is a reminder that a movie can envelop us with sweetness and warmth and still not amount to much.Writer/director Cameron Crowe starts us off in Jerry Maguire-land with a young mans crisis of confidence after a colossal failure. Drew Baylor played with a modicum of charm by Orlando Bloom is a shoe designer who has just cost his Nike-like company (Alec Baldwin is the philosopher-king who runs it) a billion dollars. He tells everyone ""Im fine"" even as hes being fired and getting dumped by his co-worker girlfriend (Jessica Biel).He collects her ""last look"" the one people give you ""when they think its going to be the last time they ever see you."" And then he plans his suicide.But his fathers death during a vacation back at dads ancestral home in Elizabethtown Ky. interrupts Drews plans. As ""the responsible one"" he has to go to Kentucky collect dads body from the relatives have him cremated and bring him home to Oregon.On the plane a perky Southern stewardess (Kirsten Dunst at her perkiest) throws herself at him in a caring-to-the-point-of-smothering sort of way.He reaches Elizabethtown where everybody knows who the young man in the rental car is. Strangers see him and wave and point him toward the funeral home.And then Dads big Southern family swallows him whole. Drew doesnt know how to grieve. They do.""This loss will be met by a hurricane of love"" his goofy arrested-development cousin (Paul Schneider) tells him. And it is. An undertaker uncle (Gailard Sartain) plans a military-themed funeral honoring Dads service. An aunt (cooking-show maven Paula Deen) shows him scrapbooks and a veritable shrine to the family tree and Drews beloved father.Drew is smothered by Southern hospitality and struggles to get his ditzy mothers wishes carried out in the face of the traditions of his dads family.Of course the girl will re-enter the picture and this being a Crowe movie theyll court slowly and achingly in the best Say Anything tradition. We should all fall in love the way Crowes characters do.Of course therell be a funeral funny and sweet and sad.And eventually Drews business ""fiasco"" which weve all but forgotten will become public knowledge.Crowe has made a movie that passionately argues against its own flaws. Yes its meandering unfocused sometimes maddening -- Susan Sarandon as a whirling dervish of a widow has never been more infuriating. But its those eddies and sidetracks that are important he says if they get you where you need to go.Crowe traffics in Southern cliches but misses a huge one. All this stuff about open displays of affection commitment to family and country celebrating the dead and not a hint of Southern religion?He stops his movie in its tracks more than once and puts the brakes on the budding romance in most unnatural ways. Drews new love sends him on this road trip of self-discovery in the films third act that all but yanks the tears from our ducts.But as messy unfocused and rambling as this is fundamentally flawed as any movie about loss that doesnt let its characters or its viewers feel that loss its still a most-enjoyable mess to sit through a Southern-fried Garden State.If only Crowe our best writer-director of romance and movies of the heart had started at the meat-and-potatoes end of the buffet.

He selects soulful slightly obscure songs from voices you know belting out messages of melancholy and hope. As a moviemaker Crowe is losing his hearing. When he tries to wed images to the songs he has selected the screen goes up in flames. Literally. Couldnt someone on the set of ""Elizabethtown"" tell him that a rock n roll stage going up in flames hasnt been funny ever since the 2003 Rhode Island nightclub disaster? And as a writer Crowe has become nearly tone deaf. ""Elizabethtown"" doesnt attempt dialogue because his characters cant achieve that challenging intimacy of a sustained conversation. Instead he puts them on the telephone with each other for long segments and they spout quips from the fly-leaves of high school yearbooks ""Im impossible to forget but Im hard to remember."" ""No one is as mysterious as they think they are."" ""I think Ive been asleep most of my life."" ""Elizabethtown"" is the kind of bomb that makes Crowes previous movies sound worse in the collective memory. Was ""Almost Famous"" a realistic coming-of-age story about rock or a cliche-filled gloss-over that studiously avoided grit and pain? Was ""Jerry Maguire"" a deep movie about sports or a shallow movie about relationships? You too may start to question your memories after the disaster of ""Elizabethtown."" Crowe set out to write what some consider his forte a bittersweet coming-of-age story far more sweet than bitter. Orlando Bloom plays Drew Baylor a hotshot in an Oregon tennis shoe company that looks intentionally like Nikes personality cult for founder Phil Knight. Drews new shoe the ""Spasmotica"" has just bombed and will cost the company 947 million in losses. He contemplates suicide but no one in a Cameron Crowe movie seriously considers offing themselves. Not while that soundtrack is still playing and in a Crowe movie the soundtrack never stops. While Drew is trying to tape a butcher knife onto an exercycle in a manner that might do him harm the cellphone rings. Drew picks up - Bloom cant die at the start of the movie - and learns his father has just died in his hometown of Elizabethtown Ky. Here begins an absurdity that resonates negatively through the rest of this overlong romantic comedy His sister is calling to say Drew has to go retrieve his fathers body alone. They all loved dear old Mitch but Mitchs wife (Susan Sarandon) cant go because shes feeling a bit manic. Sis (Heather Baylor) cant go either because she has a toddler. Have they banned children from airplanes? Each such plot development in ""Elizabethtown"" comes purely because the script says it must not because the actors or the story make it seem probable. Drew has to be alone on the airplane so he can meet-cute with insufferably perky flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst) who might make you long for the icy stewardesses in ""Flightplan."" Drew drives into tiny peach-pie-perfect Elizabethtown to more Crowe-inspired silliness. Everyone knows he is coming though hes late and points him to the funeral home. Everyone is happy and funny even though its a wake. The real problem is that everybody loved the late Mitch and Crowe never tries to explain why. When another baleful reaction shot from the frequently baleful Bloom fills the screen instead of back story we get an Elton John song. Nice song but no depth. As the two-hour movie unfolds Bloom and Dunst will of course unite break up and unite again for no particular reason other than script-mandated whimsy. The eccentric townfolk will become Drews true friends. Drew will find his own soul somewhere between the Tom Petty song and the Patty Griffin song. And Crowe will try to borrow sentiment he cant manufacture on his own. Thus the scheduling of a wedding at the same hotel where Drew mourns his father. And thus far more offensively a late road-trip montage that tosses brutally serious subjects like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.s assassination and the Oklahoma City bombings into an otherwise featherweight movie. Finally topping off the absurdity mom and sis show up for the memorial service with no explanation. This gives us a show- stopping speech and dance by mom Susan Sarandon which might be nice except that it has nothing to do with anything. Rumors say Crowe has been cutting ""Elizabethtown"" furiously since poor receptions at premieres. It has that feel. Unfinished. Ill-considered. Doomed.

"Bloom is stranded in Elizabethtown - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bloom is stranded in Elizabethtown By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 14 2005 Watch out for smart perceptive filmmakers who make movies about their fathers. Big Fish"" was Tim Burton on Paxil vacant and even-tempered. Now sadly Cameron Crowe has decided to pay his filial respects. The movie is Elizabethtown"" and its his most nakedly square picture yet.He casts the English actor Orlando Bloom as Drew Baylor a designer of high-end mass-market sneakers. After his latest shoe -- the Spasmotica -- bombs costing his Nike-like company an improbable 972 million he heads home and tries to impale himself on a kitchen knife. But just in time his cellphone vibrates with news of another death his fathers. So the son postpones suicide and flies to the films eponymous Kentucky town (dad had been visiting his birthplace) to bring the body back to his mother (Susan Sarandon) and younger sister (Judy Greer) in Oregon. The trip plunks Drew smack in the middle of an endless boisterous family he hardly knows.For a stretch the movie shows promise. The bloviating narration recedes. The personalities push themselves at Drew who blankly takes in all the accents and affection and pictures and the camera noses around the corners of a crowded house. In short Elizabethtown"" feels authentically alive.Drew on the other hand remains frustratingly inert. Bloom may be a formidable actor but in movie after movie he looks misplaced. Crowe leaves Drew in a funk for so long that by the time the fog lifts weve stopped believing. The character lacks a philosophy. Hes also missing a soul.But Crowe ever the idealist has given Drew a savior the flight attendant he meets on the plane to Louisville (magically hes the only passenger). Shes a relentlessly down-home woman named Claire played by Kirsten Dunst who again requires us to bring our sunglasses. Things are grim for a picture when not even she can pick it up but thats what a saggy state things are in here for Crowe.Claire helps Drew realize he didnt really know his dad. And in a long sequence Drew and Claire share an epic conversation on their cellphones but we never feel the click between these two. Yet for the duration of Drews brief stay they speak to each other in whimsical pontifications while the soundtrack shuffles through Crowes iTunes playlist. Apparently what they have to say to each other is better expressed by Tom Petty and Elton John.Those arent cool artists. Not anymore. Neither is the Lindsey Buckingham acoustic number that plays in one scene good as it is. But no one will ever mistake a Cameron Crowe movie for a work of cool. This of course is Crowes charm. His movies dont sit at the same table as the Tarantinos the Wong Kar Wais or the Gus Van Sants. Crowes movies possess an unfashionable earnestness. They believe in the essential goodness of you and me. They believe that love can conquer everything. Crowes best movies Say Anything . . ."" and Almost Famous"" risked cool for idealism and sentimentality. He can make you embrace corniness because better than a lot of American directors he knows that at our most besotted corniness is an apotheosis of love. To wit Renee Zellwegers You had me at hello"" in Jerry Maguire."" Only when mockingly plucked from the film does that line sound like a Hallmark moment. In the context of the movie itself it was poetry and it got to your heart. Crowes other iconic movie moment was also romantic poetry John Cusack hoisting a boombox up to Ione Skyes window in Say Anything . . . ."" Romeo spoke Shakespeare to Juliet but failing that he would have used Peter Gabriel.The crying shame of Elizabethtown"" is that nary an ounce of it approaches that sort of emotional transcendence. There is one stirring sequence a road trip across the country that caps the film but boy does it come too late. What does Crowe intend for Elizabethtown""? In part this is supposed to be his see the world"" movie but it feels hermetic. His ideas about globalism and grief are unformed to the point that his optimism seems uncharacteristically naive. The movie feels long and strangely derivative of his other better work. For the first time he cant focus his romantic abstractions into fresh moments of insight or truth. What for example are we to make of the tragically embarrassing memorial service built around Sarandon and her characters personal growth?Audiences of a certain hipster disposition in fact will see Elizabethtown"" and pine for Zach Braffs Garden State"" the movie to which Elizabethtown"" bears an unfortunate and inferior resemblance. Both movies suffer from inert heroes who are awakened by bizarre lovelies. Obviously this is a Cameron Crowe film but his writerly instincts feel as if theyre jammed up and suffocated. Indeed too much of the film is set in Drews hotel. So its stale with still air and it takes far too long for Crowe to crack a window. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Recently fired shoe designer Orlando Bloom falls for perky flight attendant Kirsten Dunst in Elizabethtown. Paramount Pictures ""Failure is simply the non-presence of success"" says Orlando Bloom as shoe designer Drew Baylor in a voice-over. ""But a fiasco is a disaster of mythic proportions."" After drawing that distinction Drew who has fashioned a debacle of an athletic shoe scuttles through the offices of the footwear giant he works for avoiding the sad stares of his colleagues. ""Im fine"" he insists. About the movie Elizabethtown   (out of four) Stars Orlando Bloom Kirsten Dunst Susan Sarandon Alec Baldwin Director Cameron Crowe Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for language and some sexual references Running time 2 hours 3 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Sadly Elizabethtown written and directed by the talented Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous Jerry Maguire) is not fine at all. Though its no fiasco -- theres nothing mythic about its disjointed story -- it is a failure. The first 20 minutes of the film show such promise that the movies subsequent unraveling feels all the more disappointing. This meandering tale feels cobbled together rather than crafted. Bloom is charming in his first major contemporary role. Dunst is at best sprightly and at worst cloying. She has a particularly annoying habit of pretending to hold up a camera and snap a picture. Maybe she was trying to help the movie get back its focus. Dunsts character begins as a jabbering prying overly helpful flight attendant. She evolves into a love interest and proves helpful and wise but also a busybody. Bloom works for a company modeled not all that loosely on Nike. He creates an ugly silver athletic shoe called ""Spasmotica."" (Do the shoes get people around only spasmodically?) The shoes are so hideous that critics predict they will cause ""an entire generation to return to bare feet."" So Drew is fired and through a series of events his mother (Susan Sarandon) sends him off to his fathers relatives in Kentucky. Thats when the comic part kicks in though not at all seamlessly. It spins out of control into wannabe wacky mode or a wan imitation of a Frank Capra comedy. He is embraced by eccentric family members who welcome him into their fold. And Dunsts flighty flight attendant continues to pop in and out of his life. She believes in the healing power of road trips and urges Drew to take his first one meticulously mapping out his path and providing its soundtrack. Clearly Crowe was trying for tears and laughter a feel-good movie about contemporary Americana. But what ends up on screen is a jumbled if good-natured mess. Some insights about family emerge but the overall concept is executed as clunkily as Spasmotica.

There are superficial similarities in their use of music but it would be hard to find a pair of directors with temperaments as dissimilar as Cameron Crowe of Elizabethtown (Paramount) and Tony Scott of Domino (New Line). Scott is vulgar unscrupulous controlling with one hairy hand on the audiences throat. Crowe is--well I keep returning to that heartfelt archetypal scene in his directorial debut Say Anything in which Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) holds his boombox aloft blasting Peter Gabriels ""In Your Eyes"" for Diane (Ione Skye) the object of his affection. Like his alter ego Crowe doesnt seem completely confident that he can convey the depth of his emotion with mere words (or images). But as his autobiographical Almost Famous made clear he has a deep connection to rock music and he passionately hopes that it can help to usher the audience into his inner world. It can and it cant in the case of Elizabethtown but enough comes through to dispel the notion widely reported after Crowe screened a longer cut at the Toronto Film Festival that its a catastrophe. It certainly grows more floridly moist until it leaves a part of the audience behind. Perhaps you need to feel indulgent toward Crowe--as you need to feel indulgent toward Lloyd--to let the climactic sequence an inspirational American travelogue with music and narration carry you along. Its lucky that I am and I did. Mostly. Advertisement Elizabethtown is a story about coming to terms with public failure in an unforgiving culture a failure compounded by the death of one father and the disappointment and rejection of another--the capitalist patriarch. Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) has worked for years to create a revolutionary new running shoe. (This is shown via well-orchestrated flashbacks.) The hoopla surrounding its manufacture propels him to the top of his profession; its disastrous reception and recall (for reasons that Crowe doesnt specify) imperils the survival of the company and sends him spinning into the abyss. Youre hooked by the opening sequence long tracking shots both funny and awful in which Drew walks through corporate headquarters to the gallows (a meeting with the driven boss a stranger to failure played by Alec Baldwin) and his colleagues either look away embarrassed or fix him with eerily sympathetic gazes. The news that his much-loved dad has died suddenly while on a visit to his childhood home Elizabethtown Kentucky is the crowning blow--but at least it forestalls his suicide. (We learn what kind of artistic temperament Drew has when he constructs an elaborate machine to stab himself.) On the empty flight the morose young man is befriended/bothered by a bubbly flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst) who claire-ly has eyes for him. Wildly alienated in Elizabethtown from the aunts uncles cousins and sympathetic friends of his dad none of whom has yet heard the news of his spectacular crash-and-burn; hectored via phone by his neurotic sister (Judy Greer) and manic mother (Susan Sarandon); torn between burying his dad (his relatives wish) and cremating him (his mothers command); and waiting for the national magazine story that names him as the architect of one of the most momentous business disasters in American history Drew picks up the phone and calls Claire. Its no surprise that this action ends up saving his life Theres a romantic (vaguely screwball) formula at work. But the pairs rapport is fresh unpredictable and by my lights pretty sexy. Bloom has been criticized for his low-key demeanor but I loved his finely calibrated performance and soft face--open but with the emotion just a little way down so that you have to keep watching him. And Dunst with her willowy body and fanged smile is an endless delight. Her readings are light almost fleeting Even as she comes on to Drew a part of her seems elusive. The problem is that Elizabethtown needed a raffish Preston Sturges-esque ensemble to offset the corn; and apart from Paul Schneider as Drews scruffy at-loose-ends cousin few in the large cast make much of an impression. (Maybe they were lost on the cutting-room floor--hey does that cliche even apply now that everything is edited on digital video?) Advertisement For all sort of reasons I was disappointed that there is barely anything--beyond a good bounding entrance--of Bruce McGill as the familys hearty swindler. And there is too much of Sarandon whose big scene--a speech at her late husbands memorial service with jokes and a tap dance--is the movies most egregious misfire. Crowe goes out on a limb with the character Hes trying to depict a shattered woman rediscovering her will to live. (Weve probably all known widows who while devastated found resources and outlets that no one could have anticipated.) But we never register the characters grief and so she comes off as shallow self-centered even inhuman. Her act is supposed to move her husbands relatives and those teary/beaming reactions are Crowes clunkiest--the visual equivalent of tin-eared. That final travelogue complete with a stop at the motel at which Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated will strike many as tin-eared too Its an attempt to discover what is hopeful and ennobling in the American landscape and character as a counterweight to the shortsighted capitalist ideals that have driven our hero to despair. As I said youll just have to go with it. One impediment is the soundtrack--a different rock song for each setting one after another practically a double album. Youd be forgiven for thinking ""Turn off the boombox Lloyd Youve got us already. Lloyd turn it off. Lloyd for Gods sake this is embarrassing. Lloyd"" Domino will beat you over the head with its incoherence But better a 90-minute Cameron Crowe travelogue (in IMAX) than a minute of Domino. Watching Tony Scotts work here I felt like the Irish drunk in Hitchcocks The Birds looking up from his stool to declare ""Its the end of the world""Domino seemed to me the end of the world for movies--a glimpse of a future so excruciating that Id prefer to take my chances with Hitchcocks eye-gouging avians. Its based very loosely on the true story of the late Domino Harvey (daughter of the actor Laurence) a ferociously unhappy sort who captured the imagination of the media by becoming a bounty hunter. (Completed before Harveys death the film omits this bit of information--not surprising since the movie is structured to leave her on the road to a healthy happy life.) My powers of description are hardly up to conveying what Scott has done with every scene every millisecond. Why film an action--say the lighting of a cigarette--in one shot when you can do it in six? So you get match swipe match flare another angle (with a double exposure) on the flare tip of cigarette burning cigarette going between lips character inhaling in close-up ... And the film stock changes in each shot one green one black-and-white one overexposed ... And the sound of that flare is like a bomb going off ... and the cigarette isnt even a big deal. OK this isnt precisely the order of shots (I cant take notes that fast) but its close. Ive seen trailers cut slower than this movie. Advertisement Does Scott think his technique is ""gritty""? He brings the camera in so close and lights his actors so severely that you can measure their pores and their moles are practically 3-D. More important the shots are cliches. There isnt a fresh angle--something that brings out an aspect of a character that isnt in the dialogue. The only desire is to pummel you and give you the jitters. I remember seeing Abel Gances silent Napoleon back when it was revived (with a full orchestra) in the early 80s and watching the early snowball sequence a furious montage that was like a different more heightened more unfettered cinematic language complete with double exposures and thinking that maybe this would inspire a new generation of filmmakers to go back to the avant-garde and find new ways of transcending naturalism. And then along came MTV and all the twenty-somethings who grew up with montage--and as bad as most music videos are even the worst can suggest that in this medium anything is possible. Of all the young mainstream directors Darren Aronofsky in Pi comes closest to inventing a new cinematic language one completely in synch with the story being told. Once Tony Scotts audio-visual hullabaloo enhanced instead of detracted from the content of a movie Enemy of the State in which Will Smith was tracked by the government with multiple satellites and surveillance cameras. The technique made the paranoia more visceral. But Domino is perpetual motion in a vacuum. Its not the fault of This Years White Girl young Keira Knightley who sticks out her long jaw and acts wounded and defiant Shes not ridiculous. There are enough weirdly cool actors around (Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken in the same movie? Wow) to make you think that if Scott held on them for a second longer something would come through. Well Rourke as Knightleys bounty-hunter mentor does register and he looks healthier than of late (not too hard--if he looked less healthy hed be dead). But no matter how hard I tried I was constitutionally incapable of staying with Domino for more than a few minutes before wincing and shutting my eyes to ward off the horror. At key junctures Scott is so desperate for more graphic busy-ness that he runs big words across the screen Sometimes they tell you the setting sometimes they reinforce a plot point. And yet the audience is increasingly lost. So Domino manages the feat of literally spelling things out and being utterly incoherent. Its the end of the world.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 14 2005 Save for later Saved Cameron Crowe has made some charming and heartfelt films like that miniclassic about first love ""Say Anything"" the grunge romance ""Singles"" and especially ""Almost Famous"" which was autobiographical in the best sense - it was a serious film about not taking things all that seriously. He also made the overrated ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" - which took itself way too seriously. ""Elizabethtown"" is a Crowe compendium and thats the problem. Everything he does here has been done better before or else wasnt worth doing in the first place.Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is a shoe designer whose latest botched creation about to hit the stores is poised to collapse his company. (The CEO deliciously played by Alec Baldwin tells Drew the shoe ""may cause an entire generation to return to bare feet."")As an added bonus Drews girlfriend dumps him and he gets word that his father has suddenly died in his hometown of Elizabethtown Ky. Jetting in from the West Coast to plan the funeral he encounters a flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst) who is so perky that you wonder why she isnt hosting her own daytime cable TV show. Their live-wire connection continues on the ground first at a distance via marathon phone chats and then face to face for more jawboning. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Elizabethtown"" is scaled big but the experience is curiously uninvolving. Part of the problem is that Orlando Bloom is featured almost nonstop and yet he never seems to be in the movie. He was fine in the ""Lord of the Rings"" because he wasnt called upon to do much more than look defiant but here he stands around for long stretches acting mopey when hes supposed to be soulful. Bloom who also struck out in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" represents a cautionary tale for directors Just because someone looks like a movie star doesnt mean he is one. Pretty soon you forget his looks too; Thats what dull acting can do. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The mystery here is why Claire is so interested in Drew in the first place. For a while you think that maybe shes a scam artist but no - its true love. Dunst almost makes the ardor believable. Claire is so eager to please because deep down her chatter camouflages a massive insecurity. Dunst gets at the desperation coiled inside all those perky types and gives it a pinch of poignancy.Thats more than can be said for most of the other actors in ""Elizabethtown"" who are playing emotional wrecks. Susan Sarandon as Drews mother turns a memorial speech for her husband into a knockabout stand-up routine and you dont feel sorry for the character you feel sorry for the actress. Ill say one thing for ""Elizabethtown"" Like every other Crowe movie it has a very well- chosen pop/rock soundtrack. It may not be much of a movie but its a terrific concert.

"Elizabethtown | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; elizabethtown ) Elizabethtown (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Following scathing audience reaction to a ""work copy"" of Elizabethtown shown at several major late-summer film festivals writer/director Cameron Crowe went back to the drawing board paring down the 138-minute ""directors cut"" to a slightly more manageable 125 minutes. However having seen both versions I can state that the elimination of 13 minutes does not address the films chief flaws. At best its a cosmetic fix. The theatrical edition of Elizabethtown while shorter than its film festival sibling does not represent a significant improvement. The central problem with Elizabethtown is that by trying to cram too much into its two-hour running time it feels disjointed and poorly focused and ends up seeming a least twice as long as it actually is. Somewhere in there theres a good movie struggling to escape but Crowe has buried it under layers of family drama clichA(c)s and scenes that go on too long or dont work. Whats sad is that Elizabethtown contains two great sequences (an all-night telephone call between two people caught ""in the moment"" during the first blossom of new love and a road trip through the American South) but its tough to generate much enthusiasm because they are suffocated by inferior detritus. Several weeks after being the toast of his company hotshot Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) has been brought back to Earth. Hard. The pet project he developed for his footwear company the Spasmotica is about to cost Mercury Shoes 972 million. Needless to say Drew no longer has a job. At the same time his father dies while visiting relatives out east. Drew travels to Kentucky while his mother (Susan Sarandon) and sister (Judy Greer) remain at home in Oregon to deal with their grief in other ways. On the cross-country flight Drew strikes up a friendship with chatty stewardess Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst). Later after a trying day of meeting with his extended family members he calls Claire and they click in a more meaningful way than they did on the plane. Thus begins Drews healing - patching over romantic heartache with a new relationship and getting to know his aunt uncle cousin and the town where his father grew up. By connecting with Elizabethtown Drew re-connects with his dead dad. Remove the uncle and aunt. Cut out the sub-plot with the cousin. And as painful as it may be reduce Susan Sarandons part to that of a glorified cameo. Her ten minute standup routine brings the film to a screeching halt. It belongs elsewhere (probably as a deleted scene on the DVD). At 30 minutes shorter Elizabethtown might approach the level of his ""lesser"" efforts Singles and Vanilla Sky. Not his best work but better than a lot of whats out there in the marketplace. Crowes strength lies in developing romantic relationships whether its the two young lovers of Say Anything the ""You complete me"" pair of Jerry Maguire or the William/Penny Lane flirtation of Almost Famous. The best parts of Elizabethtown are those when Crowe is focusing on the growing attachment between Drew and Claire. That should be at the heart of the movie bookended by the scenes of Drews flameout (at the beginning) and his redemptive road trip (at the end). Everything else - the mending of family relations getting to know his cousin setting up his fathers memorial service - is padding. Its not original or well-written and it will cause less patient viewers to zone out. Orlando Bloom is ""vanilla."" He doesnt give Crowe much to work with. Kirsten Dunst is better but shes a little too ""innocent cute."" The pairing generates some lightweight romantic vibes but no serious sexual tension. I cant help but wonder what would have happened had two more intense actors - say Elijah Wood and Scarlett Johansson - been cast. Nevertheless I think Bloom and Dunst would have been fine had Elizabethtown resisted the urge to cut away from them every time things get interesting. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the soundtrack. In the past Crowe has been lauded for his ability to wed rock music to visual images and create memorable cinematic moments (Say Anythings ""In Your Eyes"" Almost Famous ""Tiny Dancer"" etc.). However Elizabethtown suffers from music overload. Its as if burdened by his reputation Crowe felt obligated to cram in as many music bytes as possible. Is this a movie or an advertisement for the soundtrack CD? Cameron Crowe has such a great track record that Elizabethtown has to be considered a major disappointment. This is far from a bad film but it is sloppily assembled and viewed optimistically represents a mixed bag. This is the kind of movie thats best watched at home on a DVD where the closeness of the fast forward button will prove comforting during some of Elizabethtowns long-winded and trying sequences.

Looking at an image the traveler recalls not only the names of the young couple he met from the hotel room down the hall -- Chuck and Cindy lovebirds getting married who favor bridal-party T-shirts blazing Chuck and Cindys special snookums slogan -- but also what the stale air felt like in that hallway. Those greeting the traveler and his indulgent video footage meanwhile look at pictures of Chuck and Cindy and think ""Jeez Im glad I wasnt there. Hey look a cornfield. Huh funny T-shirts. Gotta remember to wash a load of darks."" Think of Elizabethtown as Cameron Crowes rambling amateur travelogue one from a well-liked professional filmmaker momentarily so distracted by private notes scrawled on his souvenir map that he gets lost en route to telling his story of self-renewal. This undershaped overlong warmedy is an homage to the memory of his late father (just as Almost Famous was an homage to his mother) to the love of a good woman (just as Renee Zellweger completed Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire) and to the balm of extended family who really dont care whether youre a famous success in the big fancy world or not so long as you stay awhile eat a second helping and pause to enjoy a gander at the stars. Its an album of vignettes -- there actually is an encounter with a bridal couple called Chuck and Cindy and its clear that seeing their picture the filmmaker remembers how in love with love the two appeared to be so optimistic and full of American spirit and with such charmingly corny taste in T-shirts; their guileless hopefulness contrasted poignantly with the lone travelers own complicated despair on that specimen day. Theres also a very long uncomfortable tap dance (a literal tap dance) from Susan Sarandon as a life-affirming widow and a tonally jarring visit to the motel site where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. And from Crowe the famous former rock journalist who knows how potent pop sound can be theres an extended shuffle of songs as if he never wants the tunes to stop ever. In Elizabethtown they dont -- they work overtime and still theres a space where Crowes yearning to convey what matters to him isnt met by the viewing party he provides. Casting is part of the problem. Dreamy to preteen girls as he is Orlando Bloom reflects no light as Drew Baylor a young hotshot shoe designer and media celebrity who has just seen his new sneaker design flop in the market-place. (I suppose Crowe ""failed"" with Vanilla Sky but surely not with such grandiose consequence.) Blooms affect is so wan and passive that its difficult to believe this Drew could win big lose big or even sneeze big although I like that Crowe has situated his spiritually depleted hero at a high-rolling Oregon-based company transparently modeled on Nike. (Alec Baldwin makes brief fine mischief as the big boss Phil transparently modeled on Nikes Phil Knight.) Are we meant to conclude that moviemaking and shoemaking share similarities of product and process? We are Sometimes you make a hit and sometimes you make a wonton-shaped loser of an athletic shoe (or movie) that threatens to sink a company. But before Drew can commit seppuku proportion is restored by a tragedy bigger than dud footwear His mother (Sarandon) and sister (Judy Greer) who are also Oregon transplants inform him that his father has suddenly died while visiting the original family homestead in Kentucky and its up to Drew to fly out and accompany the body back to the Northwest. Death of a sole is trumped by death of a soul. The rest of Elizabethtown -- given a good remedial editing once-over since its unveiling at the Toronto film festival but still squirreling and sidetracking too often for the simple intimate size of the story -- is how Drew journeys from here to there and back again and what music he listens to on his journey. Oh and boy meets girl On the plane trip out Drew crosses fate with Claire a determinedly upbeat flight attendant played by Kirsten Dunst and she becomes part of the odyssey too. ""Im impossible to forget but hard to remember"" Claire peeps one of the many koans of nothingness she chirrups with Dunst smiling and shrugging frequently to suggest goodness of heart in the absence of concrete details of personality. The phrase is cute -- like a Chuck and Cindy T-shirt -- but what does it mean? Theres no time to consider Were on to another song.

However bash lasts too long and guests try too hard to have fun and pics busy neo-screwball script suffers from arch editing and a surfeit of whimsical subplots. Modest B.O. looks likely. A correction was made to this review on Sept. 6 2005. Returning to his romantic comedy roots after ""Vanilla Sky"" helmer Cameron Crowe throws a friendly party with ""Elizabethtown"" laying on colorful characters witty banter and a constant stream of vintage tunes. However bash lasts too long and guests try too hard to have fun and pics busy neo-screwball script -- about a shoe designer planning his fathers funeral in a Kentucky town while falling for a perky stewardess met en route -- suffers from arch editing and a surfeit of whimsical subplots. Modest B.O. looks likely. Although presumably in development for some time basic set-up sounds like a sunnier studio version of Zach Braffs indie hit ""Garden State"" which beat ""Elizabethtown"" to the punch by a year and a half. ""State"" was a similar tale of a depressed young man who travels back East for a parents funeral and ends up finding love with a gorgeous hip chick. But where Braffs pic was riddled with slacker angst and featured characters with jagged edges nearly everyone in ""Elizabethtown"" is as gosh-darn nice as a warm sunny day. The only real exceptions are a couple of meanies at the West Coast corporate headquarters of footwear company Mercury where workaholic protagonist Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom) is introduced. Much like the title character in the opening of Crowes biggest hit ""Jerry Maguire"" Drew is in disgrace. Alec Baldwin brings comic relish to the scene where his CEO character Phil coldly berates Drew for fashioning a sneaker that ""may cause an entire generation to return to bare feet."" On top of that Drews g.f. Ellen (Jessica Biel) dumps him. He prepares to commit suicide but is diverted by a phone call from his ditsy sister Heather (Judy Greer) Their father has suddenly died in his hometown Elizabethtown Ky. and Drew must go there to take care of the funeral. Heather meanwhile will handle their manic mom Hollie (Susan Sarandon) who deals with grief by learning to tap dance. From here on out its as if every character in the screenplay had the phrase ""...but lovable"" attached. For starters Drew meets cute with kooky stewardess Claire (Kirsten Dunst) an archetypal Cameron Crowe femme love interest. Like Kate Hudsons Penny Lane in ""Almost Famous"" Claire is beautiful slightly neurotic and has impeccable taste in rock and pop (like Crowe). In Elizabethtown Drew meets up with his noisy extended family including maternal Aunt Dora (cooking-show host Paula Deen) laidback Uncle Dale (country star Loudon Wainwright III) wily cousin Bill (Bruce McGill) and rowdy wannabe rocker Jessie (Paul Schneider). One of pics funniest lines has Jessie countering accusations that hes not raising his son right by solemnly asserting he wants the kid ""to know about both Abraham Lincoln and Ronnie Van Zant."" (Pic pays tribute to Southern icon Van Zant the late Lynyrd Skynyrd lead singer with an impressive cover of ""Free Bird"" at its climax.) Although rich in screwball silliness and sharp one-liners film lacks the narrative drive one finds in the classic comedies of Preston Sturges Frank Capra and Billy Wilder whom Crowe always seems to try to emulate. Crowded with amusing supporting turns and eccentric minor characters ""Elizabethtown"" becomes not so much character-driven as backseat-driven taking frequent detours from the budding romance between Drew and Claire. Love story is in fact pics weak spine. Most effective point in its dramatic arc comes early on when Drew and Claire bond through an all-night phone call that ends on a tart believable note. But although Bloom and Dunst look good together the grit that makes the pearl of a great onscreen couple is missing here. Partly its the scripts fault; partly its the stars. Dunst looks luminous as ever and holds up her end well although her Claire perpetually speaks too-slick movie dialogue. Shes just a breath away from seeming like a controlling nut or worse. Blooms Drew is mostly passive and the British thesp brings little to the table apart from good looks and a reasonable American accent. Its hard to know what Claire sees in him. Films running time is drawn out by everyone getting a moment or two. For instance Sarandons Hollie has a big five-minute speech that becomes a (not very funny) standup comedy routine at the final memorial service climaxed by a tap dance. In the end the whole shebang feels as if it started out not with the characters or the funeral-homecoming plot device but with a powerhouse mix tape of outstanding ditties around which Crowe then structured his story. Choices include less-heard tunes by w.k. artists (Elton Johns ""My Fathers Gun"" Tom Pettys ""Itll All Work Out"") balanced against hits by upcoming performers like Ryan Adams (""Come Pick Me Up"") and the kind of songs only proper pop aficionados and ex-Rolling Stone scribes like Crowe would have heard such as ""Hard Times"" by Eastmountainsouth. Editing by David Moritz feels nervous and drains comic potential in some scenes by favoring shot-reverse-shot where a simple well-played master would have sufficed. At 138 minutes running time is far too baggy despite signs of last-minute trimming in several strands that dont quite pay off.
