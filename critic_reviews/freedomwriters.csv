Woodrow Wilson High in Long Beach is a recently desegregated school in which the predominantly white honours students have been forced to mix with the local blacks Latinos and Asians. Gruwell (affectionately dubbed Miss G by her class) soon realises that imbedded racial tension is disrupting the learning process at all levels and (surprise surprise) it falls to her to impose some radical methods to get these kids into higher education. Hats off to the ever-reliable Swank who invests Gruwell with a goofy charm as she naively tries to connect with her students by basing poetry classes on Tupac lyrics and clumsily drops phrases like Whats the dealio? Theres also a great turn from Imelda Staunton as the officious deputy head constantly on hand with her trusty stifling rule book. However the well-worn themes of the importance of learning and dignity of social acceptance anchor the film in the familiar bracket of Capra-esque fluff. The story too wins no points for originality (see Goodbye Mr. Chips through to Dangerous Minds) with Gruwells dedication to her job leaving you in two minds whether to weep or gag. Often youll want to do both.

With Bruce Willis Justin Timberlake Emile Hirsch. (117 min.)When Jake Muzursky cant pay a drug debt to his teenage supplier Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) the young gangster takes Jakes teen brother hostage. The kid quickly falls in with the lifestyle and becomes a sort of mascot - and liability - to Johnnys gang. Director Cassevetes has a bit more than he can handle with this complex telling of a real-life tragedy but he elicits believable performances from the young cast with Justin Timberlake especially impressive as Johnnys tough-guy-with-a-heart lieutenant.

Some African warriors turn up and help him shrink into an inch-high animated character so he can go underground and save the kingdom of the Minimoys from the marauding despot who holds grandpas treasure.

(115 min.)Step dancing has been a traditional source of pride and identity for African-American college fraternities and sororities since at least the 1920s. When DJ (Short) a hip-hop dancer from Los Angeles goes to college in Atlanta his skills soon attract attention from rival frats hoping to compete for the national championship. Groan-inducing plot twists and unnecessarily jazzed-up editing aside this movie will serve as a rousing primer for a previously little known art form thats going mainstream at schools and even churches across the country. Grade C+ - M.K.T.Verdict on Auschwitz (Not Rated)Directors Rolf Bickel Dietrich Wagner. With surivors of the Holocaust. (180 min.)Directed by Rolf Bickel and Dietrich Wagner this is perhaps the fullest-scaled documentary on the Holocaust since ""Shoah."" Made in Germany in 1993 but only being released now in the US it chronicles the mid-60s trial of 22 SS men in Frankfurt and is divided into three parts ""The Investigation"" which introduces the defendants ""The Trial"" showcasing descriptions from camp survivors and ""The Verdict"" where 20 of the SS most of whom refused to testify were found guilty. As both historical document and human document this 180-minute epic is infinitely valuable. Grade A- P.R.Still in ReleaseFreedom Writers (PG-13)Director Richard LaGravenese. With Hilary Swank Patrick Dempsey. (123 min.)Hilary Swank plays a high school teacher in Long Beach Calif. who attempts to break through to her predominantly black and Latino students in this engaging but cliched inspirational drama set during the time of the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles. On some level just about any movie featuring never-say-die teachers is effective. But if youve seen ""To Sir With Love"" ""Dead Poets Society"" ""The Corn is Green"" or ""Stand and Deliver"" - to take a random sample - youve already seen much of this movie. Swank is good though and so is Patrick Dempsey as her suffering husband. Grade B - Peter RainerSex/Nudity one instance of innenudo. Violence 17. Profanity 32. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 5.

Freedom Writers is one of those movies -- square sincere and proud of it. Based on a book that teacher Erin Gruwell assembled out of her students diary entries this version dramatizes the real-life story of the idealistic young white Gruwell (Hilary Swank) at a Long Beach Calif. high school in the angry mid-1990s era following the Rodney King riots whose underserved lot of black Latino and Asian students have been marked to fail. (Vera Drakes estimable Imelda Staunton stumbles over the thankless task of representing the kind of cartoonishly cynical educator who gives up -- a crummy first Hollywood gig unstable American accent and all.) Swank is so earnest with her big white smile and pleading neck tendons that its hard not to embrace the decency and passion of the movie adapted and directed by Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King). And when the emphasis is off Gruwell and on the kids own words and lives so much the better for the dramas narrative energy. The recent shooting death of Armand Jones one of the charismatic non-pro actors cast as a student draws awful attention to the reality that anchors this Hollywood extra-credit project.

Freedom Writers Textbook case | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFreedom Writers Textbook caseOnly the most cynical of crusty-hearted sods could possibly consider Freedom Writers as anything less than stirringly inspirational.Hilary Swank stars in the real-life story of teacher Erin Gruwell in Freedom Writers. But once Hollywood gets its scrubbers on her gritty story it loses much in the translation writes Geoff Pevere.  (AP Photo / Paramount Pictures)  By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Jan. 5 2007 Freedom Writers (out of 4)Starring Hilary Swank Patrick Dempsey April Lee Hernandez Scott Glen Mario Jason Finn Hunter Parrish. Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese. 123 minutes. At major theatres. PG Only the most cynical of crusty-hearted sods could possibly consider Freedom Writers which features a coltishly eager Hilary Swank in a truth-based story about a hypermotivated Los Angeles teacher who almost single-handedly comes between her students and ghetto oblivion as anything less than stirringly inspirational.Say hello to that sod.Inspired by the inarguably admirable classroom exploits of Erin Gruwell a freshly certified newbie who motivated her seemingly unreachable Long Beach Calif. students - mostly poor black and Latino - by using The Diary of Anne Frank as a means of getting their own thoughts on the page.Published as the book from which the movie gets its title Freedom Writers confounds its own claims to veracity by coming across as a veritable textbook in itself - a textbook of earnest liberal white-woman-in-the-blackboard jungle cliches. Sometimes art imitates life. And sometimes life goes to Hollywood and disappears completely.Opening with the now-iconic images of the post-Rodney King verdict 1992 L.A. riots LaGraveneses movie immediately establishes a tone of underclass racial tumult - its also narrated by a Latino student (April Hernandez) terrorized by both domestic and gang violence - that practically screams for liberal intervention.Enter Swank with her big-chopper smile Bambi-sized eyes and hair that looks as freshly pressed as her natty skirts the very picture of good intentions in sensible shoes.(Her through-the-looking-glass inverse is the crack-addled teacher played by Ryan Gosling in Half Nelson - an entirely fictional blackboard-jungle movie that feels considerably more true.)Naturally Erins early encounters with the kidz n the hood are faltering as she maladroitly tries to lecture them on Tupac and gang-banging eventually to learn - yes to learn thats what makes a teacher great - that what these kids really need is to speak for themselves and be listened to for the first time in their lives. And their experiences are indeed harrowing punctuated by violence addiction abuse abandonment racism and general life-in-the-projects hopelessness.But so are Erins if in a slightly different way. Regarded with wary (and eventually jealous) condescension by her colleagues and increasing petulance by her neglected boy-man husband (Patrick Dempsey) Erin is compelled to crusade in strained isolation personally financing textbooks field trips and writing supplies and holding down three jobs to subsidize the lonely salvation business.But it pays off. Not only do her kids respond to the plight of Anne Frank (and a legitimately moving classroom visit by Miep Gies played by Pat Carroll who hid the girl from the Nazis) theyre sufficiently moved to create testimonies of their own.And this within this movies unfailingly decent middlebrow frame of reference is where empowerment thrives and hope begins when you can take charge of your own narrative. But thats precisely where Freedom Writers falters if only for those (of us) frozen-hearted enough to note the irony. By handing her narrative over to the Hollywood homogenizing machinery Erin Gruwell has permitted her own story to be almost entirely sapped of authenticity.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Freedom Writers"" with Hilary Swank Patrick Dempsey April Lee Hernandez Scott Glenn Mario Jason Finn Hunter Parrish Imelda Staunton. Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese based on the book ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" by the Freedom Writers with Erin Gruwell. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violent content some thematic material and language. Several theaters. Erin Gruwell whose story is told in Richard LaGraveneses movie ""Freedom Writers"" is a quiet American hero. An idealistic young teacher at Wilson High School in Long Beach Calif. she encountered on her first day a diverse roomful of sullen-faced supposedly unteachable teens many of whose lives were affected by gangs drugs crime and poverty. Determined to find a way to connect with them she encouraged the students to write in journals (which she provided financing extra supplies through weekend jobs) to talk about books and ideas to find hope. The result was a published book of the students writings ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" and many academic success stories. Gruwell now runs a charitable organization The Erin Gruwell Education Project that awards scholarships and works to bring her methods to classrooms nationwide. Its a truly inspiring story; pity the movie doesnt live up to it. Gruwells progress surely happened gradually over a period of months and years; in order to shrink it down to two-hour movie length LaGravenese seems to have removed most nuance. Gruwell earnestly played by Hilary Swank is a shining-eyed saint; the other teachers are nasty sorts who seemingly hate kids. ""You dont even like them"" Erin accuses a fellow teacher. The colleague eyes her suspiciously and replies ""What does that have to do with teaching?"" At home Erin must cope with a none-too-supportive husband (Patrick Dempsey lit beautifully) who complains a lot about how she never has time for him and about how their bathroom has only one sink. It is I suppose an achievement to make an audience dread the sight of Dr. McDreamy himself but hes a grim one-note character of whom we quickly get enough. And the kids many of whom are played by actors visibly past their teens (theyre supposed to be high-school freshmen and sophomores but many look like theyre past graduate school) transform almost overnight from surly troublemakers to eager learners. In making the process seem so simple the film belittles Gruwells great achievement She made her students feel that they and their writing mattered and thus transformed their lives.

Directed by Richard ... more Steely Swank inspires writers in moving true story 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Freedom Writers Drama. Starring Hilary Swank Patrick Dempsey and Mario. Directed by Richard LaGravenese. (PG-13 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Richard LaGravenese won a place in the screenwriters hall of fame a dozen years ago when he spun gold out of the tinselly novel ""The Bridges of Madison County."" His source for the inspirational movie ""Freedom Writers"" is far more inspired -- actual journals of disadvantaged students at a Long Beach high school who had been encouraged by an inexperienced English teacher to write about the violence and traumas in their lives. Their heartbreaking stories of becoming victims of random shootings and losing friends and family to gunfire and prison terms published as ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" are a natural for the screen. LaGravenese who also directs resists the temptation to focus primarily on their idealistic instructor Erin Gruwell even though shes played by two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank. This was the mistake of the similarly themed ""Dangerous Minds"" in which Michelle Pfeiffers teacher is too much front and center. ""Freedom Writers"" switches back and forth from Erins privileged life to the struggle of her charges giving the latter more weight as this is where the drama lies. Swank who hasnt always been wise about her choice of roles felt strongly enough about this one to sign on as executive producer. Nobody does grit better. She adds a layer of steeliness to her portrayal of Erin. Her determination to do things her way is evident early on when she ignores the advice of a veteran colleague to not wear a pricey pearl necklace to class. Erin shows up in it almost every day accessorizing a wardrobe more suited to ladies lunches. Her curriculum also is inordinately correct discussing Homers ""Odyssey"" until a local gang shooting helps her see the urgency of seeking out more relevant subject matter. Soon the classroom is studying the lyrics of Tupac Shakur and reading ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" to understand that they are not the only youngsters who were ever under siege. A scene of them meeting with Holocaust victims -- the same concentration camp survivors who spoke with the real freedom writers more than a decade ago -- is particularly poignant. Rap singer Mario whos appeared in a few movies is a standout as Andre a student headed for trouble after his brother is unjustly sentenced to 15 years. Andre stops showing up for class. When he returns ready to give up Erin refuses to let him. Mario matches Swanks powerful emoting as teacher and protege go at it fighting for Andres future. Most of his classmates are played by amateurs selected because they could personally relate to their characters traumas and setbacks. The realism they bring to the roles more than compensates for a lack of acting experience. The movie is a tad too neatly constructed. The kids fall lockstep under Erins spell while in real life there must have been a few dissidents. LaGravenese whose screenplay credits include ""The Fisher King"" and ""A Little Princess"" is a far stronger writer than director. While good with actors hes yet to master the art of transitioning between scenes. ""Freedom Writers"" often feels claustrophobic. Much of the action logically is confined to a classroom. But LaGravenese misses opportunities to capture ghetto neighborhoods by moving the camera quickly indoors. Erins problems with her husband (""Greys Anatomys"" Patrick Dempsey underwhelming on the big screen) are inadequately explained. He quickly goes from being supportive of her efforts to jealous of the time she devotes to her students. Overall however ""Freedom Writers"" is a noble effort. At a time when New Years resolutions to change already are falling by the wayside you cant help but be moved by a group of young people who followed through on their resolve. -- Advisory Mild violence and language.

With Hilary Swank Imelda Staunton Patrick Dempsey. Director Richard LaGravenese (203). PG-13 Violent content some thematic material and language. At area theaters. How many times must we endure dramas about rowdy racially mixed high school classrooms being brought together and made productive through the talent and determination of one exceptional teacher? I say bring em on if the stories can be told as well as convincingly and as inspirationally as Richard LaGraveneses ""Freedom Writers"" an educational fantasy that happens to be mostly true. This is the story of Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) a 23-year-old first-year English teacher assigned to the freshman class at Woodrow Wilson High a school in an affluent Southern California neighborhood that had - following the 1992 L.A. riots - been opened to voluntary desegregation. When Gruwell arrives 75% of the mostly white student population has left and been replaced by underachieving Latinos blacks and Asians bused in from many miles away. On the school grounds and in the classrooms they have formed tribal bonds and tense rivalries. Gruwell is helpless at teaching these kids and is discouraged by her administrator (a wonderfully passive-aggressive Imelda Staunton) from even trying. But one day when she catches giggling students passing a caricature of a black classmate she throws a spectacular tantrum. Holding the crude drawing up she recalls how Nazis in Germany used cartoon caricatures as they began their campaign to eliminate the Jewish faith. Afterward shes astonished to learn - by a show of hands - that while almost every student in the class has been shot at almost none has heard of the Holocaust. Gruwell assigns them to read ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and to begin diaries about their own feelings as minorities. Those diaries were published in 1999 and provided the source material for LaGraveneses script. The essence of Gruwells book ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" is that she got the kids to identify with the plight of the Jews in Europe. They wrote letters to Miep Gies the woman who had hidden Anne Frank in her Amsterdam store in 1944 and Gruwell eventually got them to raise money to have Gies come to Long Beach to speak with them. The scene where Gies (Pat Carroll) appears is borderline mawkish and LaGravenese pushes it a little too hard. But it happened and Gies is still around to confirm it. ""Freedom Writers"" is a little messy around the edges. Gruwells disintegrating relationship with her attention-starved husband (Patrick Dempsey) is not well developed and Scott Glenn is unpersuasive as her father a once firebrand civil rights activist. Swank is 10 years older than Gruwell was at the time but if theyd cast a really young actress (Scarlett Johansson? Lindsay Lohan?) no one would have believed the characters confidence.

Photo Paramount Pictures Freedom Writers 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Im a sucker for true stories -- theyre stranger than fiction"" Hilary Swank has said about playing educator Erin Gruwell in Freedom Writers. Yet Swanks film feels less like a strange truth than Hollywood fiction. Thats not because we cant buy a California English teacher broadening her students worldview from gang warfare to a grasp of history and the grace of humanity. Its because this film fails to earn what Gruwell earned in real life credibility. The record shows that she transformed a class of racially divided ""unteachable"" kids into an ad hoc family of social crusaders. By writing journals of their thoughts and experiences they came to grips with their lives and their journals became the book The Freedom Writers Diary on which this film is based. That remarkable success story has been hailed by the media and honored by educators. But even with two-time Oscar winner Swank in the lead Hollywood doesnt ace the test. Swank is reliably good. Wearing prim clothes and pearls she portrays Gruwell as a well-educated privileged woman fired by the spark of her fathers (Scott Glenn) youthful activism. But she also shows the naivete of Gruwells idealism. Gruwell must learn from her students before she can teach them. The youths have imposed segregation on themselves with Hispanics African-Americans and Asian-Americans showing active disdain for one another and keeping a distance. (Theres one white boy in the class.) So Gruwell confronts the problem -- intolerance -- by making education relevant to it. She takes the students to a Holocaust museum and has them read The Diary of Anne Frank. Soon the students get hip that the Holocaust stemmed from the hate and racism that haunt their own neighborhoods. Coupled with their confessional journals they raise their consciousness becoming a rainbow coalition of sunny harmony and tearful togetherness. But that transformation while true isnt fleshed out here. Basking in the glow of Swanks spirit and selfless dedication the film rightly lionizes Gruwell (apart from her neglect of her husband played by Patrick Dempsey). But it doesnt bolster a character arc for her students. One day theyre belligerent if not hostile. The next day theyre obedient and sensitive with more crying jags than on a week of Dr. Phil. We want to buy it. We want to share the heartfelt joys of dawning hope and moving acceptance. But too often this film feels pat if not preposterous serving as a star vehicle for Swank rather than a credible life lesson for desperate students played by relative unknowns. Though admirable and worthy their journey is torturous yet barely shown. Gruwell gets more static from her rigid superiors who resist her adventurous methods. If only such adventurousness infused this film. Instead it leans on familiar riffs about inspirational teachers while failing to credit a much bigger inspiration the real-life students who reclaimed their lives. By choosing hope over hate they are this storys true heroes. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook 17 cents + pickup at...

"Its familiar but Freedom still inspires - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Its familiar but Freedom still inspires By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 5 2007 The cynical half of the movie reviewers brain Would you look at that? Theyve gone and remade ""Dangerous Minds"" that Michelle Pfeiffer inner-city-high-school movie from 1995. With all the cliches intact no less.The earnest half of the movie reviewers brain Oh stop it. ""Freedom Writers"" isnt a retread.Cynical half Of course it is -- theres nothing here that wasnt in ""The Blackboard Jungle"" and ""To Sir with Love"" and ""Stand and Deliver"" and ""Finding Forrester.""Earnest half How can it be a retread when its based on a real teacher Erin Gruwell of Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach Calif. and her real students and their real accomplishments?Cynical half Because Hollywood knows how to turn an inspirational story into boilerplate. The troubled unreachable kids who come around in the last reel the hidebound school bureaucracy the doubts the breakthroughs. The Top 40 soundtrack.Earnest half Feh. You forget that the young audience ""Freedom Writers"" is made for hasnt seen any of those other movies. More to the point almost all films work from shopworn premises. Its the job of the cast and crew to pump them up with new life and meaning -- to make them matter all over again. And writer-director Richard LaGravenese and his actors do just that. The movie works.Cynical half All right Ill agree the dialogue is unusually well-written and that the young cast gets under the skin of their roles -- especially April Lee Hernandez Mario and Jason Finn as three worst-case gangbangers who pick up journals and start writing their way into the wider world.Earnest half Exactly. And the world theyre starting from -- the post-Rodney King LA of the mid-90s -- is believably depicted as a soul-killing war zone.Cynical half But what about Hilary Swank as Gruwell? Shes just so . . . so . . .Earnest half White?Cynical half Yes.Earnest half And bouncy and idealistic and upper middle class and completely clueless about her students lives. Refreshingly ""Freedom Writers"" doesnt sugarcoat the teachers own learning curve or its effect on her marriage to a handsome guy (Patrick Dempsey) who isnt as strong as she is. Gruwells whiteness her otherness becomes irrelevant as soon as the students see shes not lying to them. They never quite let her off the hook though and in a weird comical way that becomes a sign of respect. Swank starts as a Barbie doll and ends as a mother bear.Cynical half Imelda Staunton cant do much with her role The mean old teacher who resists the rule-breaking newcomer.Earnest half She does seem like a vague version of Judi Dench in ""Notes on a Scandal"" doesnt she? All the adult roles are underwritten. It doesnt matter. ""Freedom Writers"" is about the abiding love affair between a gifted teacher and her students. Gruwells job is to show how their struggles have precedent in other peoples lives and in history. She gives them context and teaches them to express themselves within it.Cynical half Thus the Holocaust history lessons.Earnest half Youve got it. Reading ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and meeting death-camp survivors (who play themselves) gives the kids a perspective theyve never had and an impetus to do something with it. Although I agree its a little odd seeing Pat Carroll cast as Franks protectress  Miep Gies who did visit the school at the students invitation.Cynical half And I agree the kids individual triumphs seem satisfyingly hard-won. That scene where the one boy who hasnt spoken all year finally reads his journal is a killer.Earnest half You were crying. I saw it.Cynical half Problem with my contact lens.Earnest half You wear glasses. Just tell people to go see the movie already.Cynical half Go see the movie already.Both halves of Ty Burrs brain can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

"School Story Repeats Lessons Often Learned washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies School Story Repeats Lessons Often Learned In ""Freedom Writers"" Hilary Swank (with Mario) brings formidable talent to a tired classroom tale. (By Jaimie Trueblood) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 5 2007 It doesnt matter if were watching a scratchy old videotape of ""To Sir With Love"" the 1967 Sidney Poitier movie or ""Freedom Writers"" the latest back-to-school drama the question on the chalkboard is always the same When will the students ditch their attitude and love the teacher -- the one trying so hard to reach them? Why do we keep falling for movies as cut and dried as these? How do we explain our perennial support for school-based films such as ""Lean on Me"" ""Finding Forrester"" ""Mr. Hollands Opus"" and ""Dangerous Minds""? Perhaps its because the perennial audiences for these films have all-too-recent memories of lunchboxes and lockers. And because these films reinforce our need to see teachers as sensitive heroes rather than the dweebs control freaks or buffoons we remember handing us back those flunked papers. Were suckers for meaningful mentor relationships. So is it a good thing or bad that ""Freedom Writers"" which stars Hilary Swank adheres so closely to the cliched syllabus? Do we call this an invigorating reaffirmation of the things that work so well in these films or the unimaginative reiteration of same? At any given moment both are true. By the simple force of her acting Swank (as real-life English teacher Erin Gruwell) is compelling as she faces the apparently insurmountable hostility of her Long Beach Calif. high school students -- most of them blacks Latinos and Asians -- who have been deemed unteachable because of their housing project backgrounds low scores and gang affiliations. But Erins strategic little victories at Wilson High follow excruciatingly familiar patterns ringing of the trite business we associate with ""Fame"" and other hokey classroom fables. At first her teaching methods are eager and cheesy -- she tries to explain the internal rhyme structure in a Tupac Shakur song and it leaves the pupils cold even laughing. But her determination to get their respect comes through. She works extra jobs to buy them books and take them on school trips. She makes them open up by encouraging them to write about their harrowing experiences at home where death drugs and depression are staples in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. And she teaches them to look beyond their immediate worlds -- introducing them to the Holocaust and to a young girl named Anne Frank who like them wrote about the terrifying oppression around her. All of these moments may be based on true events; they are retold in ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" a book by Gruwell and her students. But even the movies darkest and most affecting subjects -- interracial hostility in the classroom and schoolyard; the churlish resistance to Erins innovative teaching approach from a dour principal (a thankless role for super British actress Imelda Staunton); a deteriorating relationship between Erin and her husband (Patrick Dempsey) -- dont feel informed by history so much as heavy-handedly manufactured from it. This is not to say that -- for the audience looking for those reliable highs lows and eventual successes -- ""Freedom Writers"" wont be satisfying. But to these classroom-movie-fatigued eyes the satisfactions amount to feel-good pornography in which some base instinct is serviced without heft grace or subtlety. The performances by the younger actors including recording star Mario and April Lee Hernandez are full of verve and conviction. And the underlying messages about respecting students and expecting great things of them will surely warm the heart of any moviegoer. But the ultimate effect of ""Freedom Writers"" is only theatrical merely Pavlovian We respond to the performances as audience members but not as true believers. No sooner have we walked away from this movie than all those take-home pearls of wisdom rallyings of the spirit and courageous gestures by students who didnt know they had it in them to excel fade away. We have experienced a sort of Chinese food poignancy the kind that may seem satisfying at the time but ultimately leaves us hungering for more for something authentic. Maybe thats why we keep coming back. Freedom Writers(123 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence harsh themes and profanity.

Another movie about a well-meaning white-bread teacher thrust among the savages? No not by a long shot. Although ""Freedom Writers"" is the latest in a long line of saint-saves-students stories it takes the bold approach of being earnest honest and unafraid to be called naive. As a result its extremely affecting. Presided over by a sensitive open performance by Hilary Swank and blessed by a gifted group of young actors the drama could win hearts and dollars especially if Paramount pushes pics humanity over its presumed nobility. There are moments in this screenwriter Richard LaGraveneses third feature as a director that may require viewers to take shots of insulin but Swanks performance overcomes the shock of the sentimental As Erin Gruwell -- the real-life teacher who with her students wrote ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" -- she is a delicate piece of fresh meat for a school of young high schoolers who are better-versed in street fights than Robert Frost. Armed with ambitious lesson plans and dreamy ideals Erin arrives at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach Calif.thoroughly ill-equipped for a student body raised according to the ethics of urban tribalism. Swank portrays Erins awe panic and ultimately her very courageous resolve to be who she is and fight on. Better known for his screenwriting (""A Little Princess"" ""Beloved"" ""The Horse Whisperer"") helmer LaGravenese mixes stylistic maneuvers while hitting very few speed bumps. Starting out with footage of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 (the film is set in 94) he sets up the students psychology through an internal dialogue narrated by one student Eva (April Lee Hernandez) a Latina gang member whose worldview is shared by her peers Their streets are a war zone and school while relatively safe is an exercise in futility. Arriving at Woodrow Wilson for her first day Erin meets her soon-to-be nemesis Margaret Campbell (a terrific Imelda Staunton) who eyes Erins string of pearls with apprehension. Margaret -- and the audience -- just know those pearls are going to be ripped off Erins neck by some felonious student; they eventually serve as both MacGuffin and talisman. Well shot by Jim Denault ""Freedom Writers"" is a good-looking film although it treads on shaky moral ground. Why does it always seem that a well-to-do white teacher is towing minority kids out of the intellectual quicksand of their environment? In this case because the story is based on the real-life Erin Gruwell and her real-life class. More crucially ""Freedom Writers"" initially at least paints such a hopeless picture of underprivileged black and Latino teen lifethat many viewers would advise Erin to throw in the towel. Eventually however the desperation of their circumstances adds luster to Erins work in the classroom. Most of the movie takes place in that classroom where Erin hits upon ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" as a way into her students hearts and minds -- and as a motivation for their own journal writing a collection of which became the book on which the film is based. A visit to the school by Miep Gies (Pat Carroll) the Dutchwoman who helped hide the Franks (and still lives in the Netherlands) is virtually guaranteed to reduce even the most jaded viewer to a heap of weepy gelatin.

"Freedom Writers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; freedom-writers ) Freedom Writers (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The key to making a successful formula motion picture is to infuse it with energy and add a few original elements. The overall product might seem familiar but that doesnt mean it cant be an enjoyable viewing experience. This is true regardless of the formula underdog sports hero boy meets girl or unconventional teacher who makes a difference. Freedom Writers falls into the latter category and as often seems to be the case with movies of this genre it is based on a true story. Writer/director Richard LaGravenese (whose previous screenplays include The Fisher King and The Bridges of Madison County) does what competent filmmakers do with these Dangerous Minds tales - he takes the basic facts and massages them until they are suitably cinematic. The MTV imprimatur indicates the movie is being targeted at teenagers. The film is set in Long Beach shortly after the L.A. riots. Hilary Swank plays Erin Gruwell a crusading young woman who believes the way to stop racial hatred is to influence young minds. To that aim she applies to work in a forcibly integrated school where the students are divided into four camps whites Latinos Cambodians and blacks. Her lofty goals are not shared by her department head Margaret Campbell (Imelda Staunton) her ex-activist father (Scott Glenn) or her neglected husband Scott (Patrick Dempsey). Erins first few days in class are a rude awakening but a discussion about Hitler and the Holocaust opens unexpected doors and the teacher begins to connect with some of her students including the hardcore Eva (April Lee Hernandez) and the closed-off Andre (Mario). Erin then hands out composition books and has the teenagers make daily entries. In 1999 those ""assignments"" were published as The Freedom Writers Diary which is the source material for the movie. The bottom line premise - that Erin changes the lives of her students while they change her - lies at the core of every similar movie. But the means are refreshingly different. Erin finds ways to compare Hitlers actions against the Jews to instances of gang violence. Although it may seem to be a stretch making these similarities gives Erin an entrance into her pupils world. When she hands out copies of The Diary of Ann Frank the kids are engrossed. Erins assignment for them to write letters to Miep Gies (Pat Carroll) the woman who hid Ann from the Nazis results in a visit from the elderly lady whom one black student labels as his ""hero."" The structure is awkward. The emotional climax of Freedom Writers comes 90 minutes into the film with the arrival of Miep Gies and the life-altering choice made by one of the students as a result. However LaGravenese keeps things going for 30 more minutes and Freedom Writers begins to wear out its welcome. Theres another emotional moment at the end but it feels contrived. While the one at the 130 mark has a ring of authenticity the one at the films end feels like its all Hollywood. Theres also something strange going on with Erins pearl necklace. During the first 20 minutes an inordinate amount of attention is paid to that piece of jewelry. We are sure its going to be stolen. Then unexpectedly this plot element is dropped. Has the necklace been pilfered? Has she stopped wearing it? Is the fact that it isnt stolen proof that the kids arent thugs? We dont know because the movie doesnt tell us. Im sure something ended up on the cutting room floor but what remains in the final version is sloppy. LaGravenese should have either provided a resolution or found a cleaner way to assemble the theatrical print. Its not a big thing but it is annoying. The film mixes new young talent with experienced veterans. The best of the former is April Lee Hernandez who possesses a ""firecracker"" quality that could lead to bigger roles. Her Eva is part of a high school ensemble but she stands out. Thus far Hernandezs credits are primarily TV guest spots but theres no reason she couldnt graduate to more visible parts. (As might be expected the Ms. Gruwells ""freshmen"" are often played by actors in their early 20s. Work hours for actual teenagers are too restrictive.) Hilary Swank smiles her way through the early part of the movie then develops a harder edge later in the proceedings. Its nice to see Scott Glenn (who has primarily been doing TV since the turn of the century) although his role is of limited importance. Patrick Dempsey is underused; one suspects he took this role before Grays Anatomy boosted his image. Freedom Writers delivers the expected messages about hope and the ability to change ones destiny and does it in a manner that it is emotionally and intellectually satisfying. This isnt a great movie but it is effective drama where the big emotional scenes more often feel real than contrived. Through voiceovers LaGravenese uses passages lifted from the actual students diaries to provide the framework for the secondary stories (those of the teenagers) thereby lending a ring of authenticity. For those who see it the movie has a chance to connect. Freedom Writers is superior to what film-goers typically expect from an early January release.
