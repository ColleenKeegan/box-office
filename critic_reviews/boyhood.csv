Linklater filmed his leading actor Ellar Coltrane over 11 years beginning when Coltrane was 7 and ending on the far side of puberty when the boy was 18. So you see the actor go from cute and compact to a wee bit pudgy to long-waisted and deep-voiced and the ongoing transformation alters the way you watch. Time in cinema is relative and easily fudged but in Boyhood the realness of time is central -- and in context uncanny. You go ""Whoa he shot up"" And you might find yourself thinking as I did ""Oh right this is how it was when I was young and every atom was in flux when I felt something new every second of every day and didnt have a name for it."" Each moment is fleeting and for that reason momentous. When we meet Coltranes character Mason in 2002 his parents have separated. His father (Ethan Hawke) has taken off for Alaska and his mother (Patricia Arquette) is chafing against the strictures on her life--against the feeling that first she was ""somebodys daughter"" and now shes ""somebodys mother"" and that time is wastingA her. The early scenes in the familys small Texas home (Linklaters daughter Lorelei plays Masons older sister Samantha) are casual mundane not as ostentatiously transcendental as Terrence Malicks inA The Tree of Life but the telling details build and begin to resonate. Mason likes arrowheads -- hes already taking the long view of civilization -- and reads the latest Harry Potter and peruses a lingerie catalogue with a friend Tommy and sees a dead bird around the time his mom says theyre moving to Houston soA herA mom can look after them while she goes back to school. As they pack Mason scrubs his height chart off the wall. His sister tells his friend on the phone ""Sorry Tommy Mason cant come out today were moving"" and says ""Good-bye house ... Good-bye lawn"" and Mason sees Tommy bicycling toward them as their car pulls away; life already going going gone. I dont know how much ofA BoyhoodA Linklater mapped out a dozen years ago but Id like to think he watched his actors and his own life and let many of the details find him -- let the story come over time. But maybe hes just great at hiding the scaffolding. Nothing ever seems settled. When Mason and Samanthas father shows up in Houston for a visit hes nervous over-effusive probably stoned. He wants to be a good dad -- maybe even reconcile with his wife.A But hes plainly a screw-up with no job and no design for living. And then Mom marries one of her professors Bill (Marco Perella) and its on to the next phase the next chapter. You dont see Coltrane acting only behavingA re-acting his hair and face and body changing but his consciousness constant. Whats happening on the outside reflects some of whats inside but not all. Its not a one-to-one correspondence.A BoyhoodA is more open than that more amorphous. Professor Bill is a scary alcoholic but the fear doesnt come all at once. Feelings are usually one or two steps behind events. Later on Linklater tips his hand a bit when Mom -- now a professor herself -- lectures on Bowlby and Attachment Theory and were probably meant to wonder ""What part of Mason is the upshot of free will and what part a consequence of ruptures and bad parenting?"" Hes obviously working on that problem himself trying to figure out whats everybody and whats uniquely him. Parents lecture him teachers lecture him but Mason grows more inward more out of reach to grown-ups. And then when hes a senior in high school he meets a girl and begins -- of course -- to find his tongue. That parts genetically programmed. Linklater has always been prone to using time as a character. Its in the titles of hisA BeforeA trilogy featuring actors playing the same characters at different periods of their lives. InA Before SunriseA (1995) twentysomethings Hawke and Julie Delpy meet on a train and talk. InA Before Sunset made nine years later they meet again and talk. Nine years after that cameA Before Midnight in which theyre married with kids and not talking as much -- until halfway through when they finally hash things out. They have to reconnect in each film -- and fast because the clock is ticking toward sunrise sunset midnight. I love theA BeforeA films but theyre ... talky. Linklater is so literal about time that you never feel hes using the full transcendent resources of cinema. He does inA Boyhood. You cant call his touch glancing -- scene by scene hes tightly centered -- but he covers a lot of ground. You can feel the impact of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq via Moms next boyfriend whose ideals and actions seem dangerously far apart. Dad moves to Austin hes rah-rah Obama and then he marries into a good Texas family of God and guns and is suddenly stable not so gung-ho change anymore. CDs become iPods and iPods become iPhones and Mason muses about Facebook about a generation stuck in ""an in-between state not experiencing anything."" His worldview is evolving before our eyes. We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable the sister drops out as a dramatic character a| I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous. Arquette taps into her anger a the anger I suspect of an aging actress in this culture a and has never been so vivid. Hawke smoothes out Dadas hairpin psychological turns by having the character comment on them as if narrating his life for his son. Living with Mason and his parents over time you feel an intimacy an empathy a shared stake. Iam not saying Boyhood is the greatest film Iave ever seen but Iam thinking thereas my life before I saw it and my life now and itas different; I know movies can do something that just last week I didnat. They can make time visible. This article appears in the July 14 2014 issue of New York Magazine.

And with the cameras rolling wouldnt you know it -- the Astros hit a home run. How lucky you think that Linklater was able to incorporate a real-life homer into his scene. But as the film progresses -- at its own relaxed distinctive pace -- you soon realize that virtually every scene is a little home run of its own. And luck has very little to do with it. We already knew Linklater was one of our most accomplished independent filmmakers and anyone whos a fan of his ""Before"" trilogy -- ""Before Sunrise"" Before Sunset"" and the recent wonderful ""Before Midnight"" -- knows how eloquently he can portray the passage of time. But ""Boyhood"" is something different entirely. Filmed over 12 years for a few days each year the movie follows one family -- two parents two kids -- as they navigate love marriage divorce school work pain pleasure and everything else a family can go through. Yet the story isnt particularly dramatic -- certainly not by the standards of typical Hollywood storytelling. Indeed its utter simplicity -- some might say even banality -- is its strength. What happens to this family and specifically to Mason the main character over 12 years? Life. Thats what happens. While everything about ""Boyhood"" is done with extraordinary care the master stroke was clearly the casting 13 years ago of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane with a mop of light brown hair and dreamy eyes. Its hard to imagine Linklater could have known then that hed develop into such a soulful adolescent or such a thoughtful-yet-awkward young man perfect for the later scenes. But he did. We first meet Mason lying on the grass staring at the sky. He and big sister Sam (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) are living with their harried divorced mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette). Dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) is charming and loving but unreliable and hes been off finding himself in Alaska. Mom moves the family to Houston so she can go back to school and get her degree. She ends up marrying her psychology professor (an excellent Marco Perella) and its a catastrophe -- he turns out to be a dangerous angry drunk. (These scenes are harrowing.) Olivia escapes with her kids begins a teaching career makes another bad husband choice. Meanwhile Dad grows up remarries has a baby. Sister Sam morphs from a precocious young girl who sings Britney Spears ""Oops I Did It Again"" to an awkward preteen with braces to a cocky teenager who responds to a demand to dust the house ""I mean who DUSTS anymore?"" The films full of fun cultural markers. Cellphones become smartphones. Masons GameBoy becomes an Xbox. Political talk ranges from George Bush and the Iraq invasion to the Obama-McCain race in 2008 and later developments. The soundtrack carefully echoes the changing times. And in a prescient moment dad and son discuss whether there should ever be a ""Star Wars"" sequel. (They decide it wouldnt work. Ha.) The film shot entirely in the disappearing 35mm format feels so much like a documentary that occasionally pieces of clearly scripted dialogue sound forced. But thats rare. Mostly the actors blend seamlessly with Linklaters naturalistic style. Arquette is heartbreaking as a mom who tries so hard but always comes up short. Hawke continues to do his best work with Linklater seemingly his artistic soul mate. But the actor who will stay with you the most is Coltrane. Late in the film an adult who hasnt seen Mason in years squints and says ""Mason is that YOU?"" If youre like me you may find yourself smiling knowingly with even a tinge of pride. Because by this time we dont just know Mason; Mason is ours. Thats the simple brilliance of Linklaters achievement. ""Boyhood"" an IFC Films release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for language including sexual references and for teen drug and alcohol use."" Running time 166 minutes.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 17 2014 814AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 17 2014 428PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Richard Linklater Written by Richard Linklater Starring Ellar Coltrane Patricia Arquette Ethan Hawke Lorelei Linklater Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Language English Richard Linklaters Boyhood both a fictional drama about growing up and a wonder-rousing cinema experiment deserves all the accolades it has been receiving since its appearances at the Sundance and Berlin film festivals earlier this year. Presented in 143 scenes shot in 39 days over a dozen years with the same cast the film explores that permeable border between drama and documentary in a way that evokes recognition melancholy and joy while sticking to the mundane experiences of one boys life. Video Watch the Boyhood trailer The subject of Boyhood is played by Texas actor Ellar Coltrane and we see him travel from the age of six to 18 from a cherubic child to a pudgy uncertain adolescent to a bony deep-voiced man. His head and body pop and lengthen over the years along with the length and complexity of his sentences. Its like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.You could measure Boyhood against some similar projects - Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel film series starring Jean-Pierre Leaud as the same character over four feature films one short film and 20 years comes to mind or Michael Apteds documentary Up series - but Linklaters film is very much its own hybrid creature. While the dramatic scaffolding is lightly drawn it becomes apparent that Linklater has organized his material along certain themes most notably that of the passage of time and the dream life of childhood.When we first meet Coltranes character Mason his parents are getting a divorce. His father (Ethan Hawke) has gone to Alaska to look for work. His mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) is overwhelmed stuck in a dead-end job and raising Mason and his attention-demanding older sister Samantha (the directors energy-charged daughter Lorelei Linklater). Olivia starts from a position of disappointment a place where she repeatedly returns.Time is the subject matter Mason tellingly collects ancient arrowheads and dreams away the school days. His first descent from the world of innocence into experience comes when his mother announces theyre moving to Houston so she can return to school and find a better life for her children. Mason has to leave his house and best friend behind and before he goes he sees a dead bird - a small harbinger of death.Closely tied to this idea of time is the feeling of the vulnerability of childhood experience how dependent we all are on the choices and behaviours of adults. After the family relocates Mason Sr. (Hawke) comes to visit. Hes a motor-mouthed charmer with boundary issues (he stops by his ex-wifes house when hes expressly been asked not to). He wants Olivia back but its obvious that she is wary that shes been hurt before and not eager to wait for her husband to grow up.Mason Sr. really likes to talk - a characteristic of Linklaters characters - offering a kind of running commentary on his own life experiences trying hard to be the fun alternative to the stress-worn Olivia. By the end of the film Mason Jr. has grown into a more sensitive version of his father and another articulate dreamer mulling about his destiny in the world. That repetition is not just a function of the script but of some inspired casting in finding a kid who grows so persuasively into a moody intellectual. More amazingly the pudgy little cherub of the early scenes also develops the heavy brow and hollow cheeks of a young Ethan Hawke.The place where design meets happy accident is one of the films constant pleasures. The other is the beautifully observed social reality that the actors embody as they thicken mature and show the effects of gravity both physical and emotional. Olivia who wants to improve herself forges an upwardly-mobile relationship with a middle-aged psychology professor Bill (Marco Perella) who turns out to be an overbearing drunk. Among the patterns here Olivia repeatedly shows bad judgment about men The irresponsible Mason Sr. the scholarly Bill and later a nice-guy Iraq veteran who turns mean all chafe at their adult responsibilities. Boyhood it turns out is a lot about having disappointed older men take their frustrations out on you.The focus as in the Truffaut stories is on the resilience of children the adaptations and misadaptations when their world can suddenly turn dangerous at the dinner table. The small intimate touches here are the best Frightened by his angry stepfather Mason hides out in a bedroom and obsessively watches his favourite comedy video A 2007 Funny or Die sketch in which Will Ferrell is terrified by the girl toddler who is his drunken landlady. Pop music and culture moments serve as markers Loreleis sassy impersonation of Britney Spearss 2000 hit Oops ... I Did It Again; a 2005 night-time trek to buy the first copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince; the Nintendos and iPods and speculation about the future of Star Wars. The more conventional movie coming-of-age moments - an encounter with bullies high-school graduation the heartbreak of first love and betrayal (ouch) are heart-rendingly authentic and free from tidy resolutions.Linklater has already experimented with time in his Before trilogy with Hawke and Julie Delpy who play the same characters in three movies over an 18-year period each film set within a 12-hour time frame. The risk in Boyhood was obviously much greater though the quasi-documentary approach allows the freedom of not having to tie up all the narrative loose ends.At one point Olivia advises an immigrant gardener to go back to school and he pops up a few years later in a new role grateful for her advice. But those happy coincidences are as rare as they are in life. Other characters - including Mason and Loreleis unhappy stepsiblings - simply fall out of the picture as people sometimes do.Though photography and cinema have long made special claims for representing reality in the era of computer-generated imagery and Instagram home snaps we no longer assume that any film is an accurate record of life. Yet Linklaters experiment in temporal sampling reminds us how much film can serve as a gateway to a larger reality. Throughout Boyhood we recognize one moment after another and those moments trigger our own sense of the patterns in our lives.Boyhood opens July 18 in Toronto and in other cities throughout the summer.

Boyhood a triple winner at New York Film Critics Circle Awards Ethan Hawke juggles bombs and barbecues in Good Kill Boyhood is not just the best film of Richard Linklaters 26-year filmmaking career in Texas. It is simply and elegantly the best film seen so far in 2014 -- and it stands a good chance of staying in the No. 1 position to the end of the year. Oscar beckons. As storytelling Boyhood is a superbly conceived drama about one boys life as he grows up through his 12 years of schooling prior to college. As cinema Boyhood is a quiet revolution in technique. Linklater filmed his story in yearly increments over the 12 year-period that it covers. He did so with the same core cast on screen. So we watch Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke who play the divorced parents as they age gracefully gaining or losing weight changing their hairstyles and gradually pushing from their 30s into their 40s. Given that we have seen all those stages unfold in the public eye through other films and TV shows there is nothing radical about it. But it is still worth noting because the first time-capsule glimpse of each is startling as the film begins. Ellar Coltrane is an entirely different matter. Linklater pulled off a filmmaking miracle. He cast Coltrane a fellow resident of Austin when the boy was just six years old. Coltrane is now 19 (and soon to be 20) as the film rolls out slowly in its staged release this summer. He was 18 when filming wrapped and Linklater plunged into the editing process. In Coltrane Linklater managed to discover a charismatic youngster who as he aged managed to stay as mesmerizing on screen at 18 as he was at six. Despite doing other films in the interim Coltrane stayed pure never becoming a Hollywood brat. In the character we see with startling clarity the essence of growing up. Here is a boy who reacts intimately with the tidal changes in his household as his part-time dad asserts himself as a new step-father turned alcoholic and violent as another step-dad becomes sullen and manipulative as his sister (effectively played by the directors daughter Lorelei Linklater) affects him with her maturation as his own girlfriends come and go as schooling proves to be a challenge as his interests in life morph in surprising ways. By the time we get to the slightly silly purely naive and ultimately profound final scene Boyhood has illuminated a real life being well lived to the brink of manhood. The story Linklater created with his actors is highly specific. But the emotional content is universal. I for one among many feel that the film is actually about my own youth. This transformational quality is exactly what makes Boyhood a masterwork because the film speaks directly to us with veracity with honesty and with quiet enthusiasm. A word about the films epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting so much a thing of wonder that it could run forever and I would still keep watching. bruce.kirklandsunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

Big ScreenMovie Reviews A boys life 1 0 By Scott Marks July 16 2014 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it ""Twelve Years in the Making"" Sounds more like a tagline from a Hollywood biblical epic not Boyhood the latest commendably ambitious film from director Richard Linklater. I know what youre thinking. Would it really have made that much difference had Boyhood been filmed over a period of three months with a range of actors playing the leads at various stages of their lives as opposed to a 12-year shoot that affords its cast the relatively unheard of luxury of literally aging before our eyes? I say relatively because two similar cinematic experiments immediately come to mind Francois Truffauts 20-year 41/5 film Antoine Doinel cycle (The 400 Blows Stolen Kisses etc.) starring Jean-Pierre Leaud as the directors alter ego and Michael Apteds continuing series of Up documentaries which starting at age seven began chronicling its subjects growth in seven-year increments. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) are the product of good people (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) who couldnt make their love work. With dad temporarily out of the picture we begin to follow Mason on his journey through age 5 to 18 passing from family to family in one Texas town or another. Known only as ""Mom"" Arquette could qualify for parent of the year were it not for the bad romantic choices she made. Coltrane is the donut hole in a box containing an otherwise delectable assortment of performances. Once he gets caught using his teachers pencil sharpener to turn rocks into arrowheads not much initiative is provided and his soft-sell reactions to events around him take on even less command. Its doubtful that Linklater had a finished shooting script tucked under his arm the first day he called ""Action"" Much of the films appeal stems from its structured commitment to chronicling growth without relying on improvisation as a crutch. It would have been impossible for Linklater to divine what events would unfold during the great shoot and the film stumbles only in its clumsy attempt to depict a shift in political tone. While Ethan Hawke is out stumping for Obama he instructs his son to pull a McCain poster from a neighbors lawn. Years later and a second marriage lands him squarely in Bush territory made blatantly obvious by a birthday party where Masons new set of grandparents gift the 16-year-old with a Bible and a gun. Boyhood  Linklater doesnt take the easy way out by simply compiling an ironic checklist of technological advancements or padding the score with wall-to-wall recognizable tunes. And blessedly there is not a trace of sentimentality. The dialog is refreshingly honest; for a change the kids counter their parents exhortatory counsel with equally invasive questions of their own. Linklaters casual hand at storytelling dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce.

Filmed over 12 years it traces the development of Mason Evans (Ellar Coltrane) a pensive boy growing up in a series of central and south Texas towns. The story--of parents struggling to raise children in a wondrous conflict-ridden world and the young ones grappling with forging their identity in it--is a universal one.The bildungsroman is a common trope in literature and the coming-of-age story is not unique to film. But Masons growth is not scripted; he grows up before our eyes in real time. Boyhood was filmed over two weeks every year for 12 years tracing the actors life from the age of 6 until 18 when his character drives off to college. Coltranes development as both a human being and an actor makes Boyhood less a capital-F film and more like spending hours thumbing through old photo albums in the basement marveling at the memories materializing from the stills.The boy moves constantly with his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) from a small town in Texas to Houston and then San Marcos often to escape the trail of violence from Olivias various alcoholic husbands. He weaves through cul-de-sacs with friends on bikes and stares at his family as a teenager aching for a sliver of understanding that isnt there. The poignancy of his nomadic childhood is rooted in Linklaters obsessive attention to detail like the sound of cicadas humming in trees or a joyous afternoon rolling down the big hill at Houstons Hermann Park. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Mason possesses a rare clairvoyance for a young man. He sees things that others dont--he is the one who overhears many of his parents fights and teachers instruct him to stop daydreaming in class. Later on he pours himself into photography often locking himself in his high schools darkroom where he finds the ability to craft his own perspective and in turn his cynical worldview.The introverted boy (and actor) is the quietly radiant star of Boyhood but Arquettes and Ethan Hawkes emotive roles as his parents both instigate and assuage the conflict that inevitably shapes their son. Arquettes and Hawkes characters are fiercely dedicated to their children but are just as vulnerable as the kids are especially at the beginning of the film. We see them evolve too Olivia moves from struggling to pay the bills to becoming a successful college psychology professor while amateur musician Mason Sr. (Hawke) quits making excuses and becomes a dedicated father with a positive influence on both Mason and Samantha.The passage of time is fascinating in Boyhood. Olivias third husband mentions being sent home from Iraq after 9/11 while a scene depicts Mason with wizard cape and taped-bridge glasses excitedly awaiting the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince at a bookstore. The music flits from punchy (the Hives) to moody (Aaliyah) to Arcade Fires The Suburbs a conceptual record about the turmoil of growing up in the woodsy Houston suburbs. Yet time is a flighty character in the film. You blink and there Mason is--slightly older increasingly hell-bent on understanding the world around him and by association himself.Linklaters films focus on folding and unfolding lives in lethargic Texas. He is less focused on riding out a riveting plot than he is with obsessing over a perfect milieu. Linklaters previous films especially Waking Life and Slacker were driven by dreamy characters coming to understand themselves through philosophical interactions with others often other lonely people. Early on in the film Mason sadly tells his father just as theyre about to go to sleep ""Theres no real magic in the world is there?"" Mason Sr. a part-time cynic struggles to answer in a way that is truthful but not devastating. Masons question burns with the viewer especially given a hopeless week of trying world tragedies. Yet if only for a few hours on a Saturday night Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.

"Boyhood | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; boyhood ) Boyhood (United States 2014) August 09 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli One thing becomes clear upon watching Boyhood director Richard Linklater is fascinated by the concept of following a fictional character through real time. Most filmmakers lack the patience to attempt something like this. In spirit if not in the particulars Boyhood recalls Linklaters Before trilogy Before Sunrise Before Sunset Before Midnight. Those movies follow two lovers over an 18-year span catching up with them at nine year intervals across three films. Real time passage equals screen time passage. Boyhood does something comparable tracking characters across a dozen years visiting them once a year but putting everything together into a single film rather than spreading the moments across multiple installments. Still the basic concept is similar allowing the aging of the actors to inform and enhance their portrayals of the characters. If that was all Boyhood had to offer it could be seen as a gimmick. Fortunately this is also an exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story. The experience of watching an actor grow up on screen is so fundamentally different from what were used to that it shifts how we watch the movie. To be sure were used to films in which characters age but this is typically accomplished by using computer imagery or employing the services of different performers. The way in which Linklater has accomplished this is radical enough to be noticed. (Its also not a trend likely to be widely adopted; it took 12 years to make Boyhood. In an era of immediate gratification few studios are going to be willing to wait that long.) Theres a documentary aspect to the production. Not only do we watch lead actor Ellar Coltrane mature from age six until young adulthood but were accorded the same privilege with Linklaters daughter Lorelei. (According to the director Lorelei demanded the part lost interest after a few years then became bullish again.) Were accorded the opportunity to see familiar faces Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke change over an equal period although the effect isnt as dramatic because both actors remained in the public spotlight throughout the period when they were making Boyhood. Coltrane plays Mason and Lorelei Linklater is his older sister Samantha. When we first encounter them theyre living with their single mother (Arquette) who is struggling to make ends meet on a menial salary. Their father (Hawke) isnt in the picture having gone to Alaska in search of work. Over the course of the next dozen years Mom marries and divorces for a second time Dad spends time with his kids every other weekend and during summers Mason and Samantha go through puberty discover the opposite sex drink and smoke pot. Mason experiences the heartache of a break-up and the bittersweet freedom of moving out on his own. Watching Boyhood is like peering through a portal into the intimate details of the lives of others. Sometimes the simplest stories can be the most moving because theyre so easy to relate to. The characters in Boyhood could be your neighbors your friends or you. Theres no melodrama; its not needed. Without flourishes or seeming to be intrusive Linklaters camera captures the minutia of everyday living. Nothing is overblown. The ""biggest"" incident is when Moms second husband under the growing influence of alcohol loses his temper at the dinner table and smashes a few things. Soon after Mason and Samantha are rushed out of the house; we never see the alcoholic or his children again. As in life the stories of others are often incomplete. We see how fleeting and fragile life is. The year-to-year transitions are seamless and because there are no changes in actors everything blends realistically. During the course of its nearly three-hour running length Boyhood takes us on a journey. This is a chronological road trip rather than a geographical one. When its over the sense is one of deep satisfaction - of having gotten to know a family in a way few motion pictures allow. Because of the dedication and effort involved in making something like Boyhood we probably wont see its like again in the near future but Im glad for this opportunity to view the results of Linklaters bold and rewarding experiment.

(AP Photo/IFC Films) In his song ""Beautiful Boy"" John Lennon said ""Life is what happens to you while youre busy making other plans."" For a beautiful boy named Ellar Coltrane life is what happened while he was making a movie.Starting when he was 7 every summer for a dozen years Coltrane spent weekends on a unique production with director Richard Linklater. At the end of 12 years the secret project bloomed into ""Boyhood"" the closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.Like life this long movie unspools in mundane moments. And as with so many American kids Mason (Coltrane) takes the fissures in his family for granted. It seems as if half the film takes place in the back of a car as his divorced mother (Patricia Arquette) leaves another abusive relationship or his out-of-town father (Ethan Hawke) arrives for another weekend adventure with contemplative Mason and hyperactive sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater daughter of the director). While the father drives a vintage muscle car teaches Mason about the latest music and encourages the kids to emote the mother bears the unglamorous burden of raising them while juggling jobs and night school. Yet one of the advantages of Linklaters time-lapse format is how a years difference can redirect the winds of change. The penniless mother becomes an honored teacher; the maverick father finds himself married into a family of Bible-thumpers.Unlike the Michael Apted documentary series that started with ""7 Up"" in 1964 the narrative ""Boyhood"" proceeds in a straight line without flashbacks to underscore the passage of time or the ravages of aging. Some of the important moments and recurring themes do not become clear until years later as when the lonesome mother makes the same mistakes thrice. Nor are there glowing mileposts to mark significant events in history. Although one of the mothers suitors is an Iraq War veteran the movie unfolds from a kids-eye view and the new ""Harry Potter"" is more important to him than the latest headlines. The film would be incalculably different if the lead role had been divided between two or three young actors for a conventional shoot. But Linklaters patience allows us to see a thoughtful personality being formed both on and off the screen. As Mason arrives at college discovering a cast to co-star in his young-adult adventure the sun sets on ""Boyhood"" and a world of possibilities opens up for Ellar Coltrane.What ""Boyhood""  Four stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 245  Content Strong language including sexual references and teen drug and alcohol use Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Boyhood (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Boyhood (R) Richard Linklaters miraculous stunt of a movie is one of the years best. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/24/2014 Editor rating 4 Contrary to most Hollywood dramas about ordinary people which tend to dwell on traumatic or seismic events Richard Linklaters Boyhood argues that life is a compilation of small everyday moments an accumulation of the feelings and thoughts and emotions we start to gather from the time we are children. Shot over the span of 12 years with the cast getting together for a few days annually to shoot some scenes the movie charts the growth of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from the ages of 5 to 18. Mason has an older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) and he has two loving parents Mom (Patricia Arquette) and Dad (Ethan Hawke) who are divorced and live apart. Their relationship can be contentious at times but they both care deeply for their kids. Linklater has worked in various modes before -- straight-up studio pictures (The Bad News Bears School of Rock The Newton Boys) experimental animation (Waking Life A Scanner Darkly) even a combination of documentary and fictional narrative (Bernie). But the approach he uses in Boyhood is the same one he took for his Before trilogy (Before Sunrise Before Sunset and Before Midnight) a subtle inobtrusive style that makes you feel as if you were peering into the lives of real people going about their humdrum business. There is no score in Boyhood no title cards or montages nothing to come between you and the film. We notice Masons growth by his changing hairstyles and loss of baby fat and upgrading of video game systems (his sisters sudden growth spurt is another indicator). Gradually this pear-shaped little kid becomes a tall lean kind teenager. Theres nothing extraordinary about him which is what makes him so intriguing. Hes not a stand-in for the audience -- hes his own distinct person -- but youve probably met people like him in real life which is what gives the picture its transfixing power. You are literally watching a young man grow up before your eyes. Coltrane who is chatty and eloquent in real life plays Mason as a quiet observant kid who absorbs elements of his parents personas His dads arrested-development lets-have-fun enthusiasm (he still drives a GTO) and his moms sense of responsibility and duty. The movie could have easily been called Motherhood because Arquettes journey -- going back to school to earn her degree so she can get a better job enduring two bad marriages preparing herself for the inevitable day when her kids will leave the nest -- is just as arresting as Masons. Arquette taps into the same sort of natural non-acting Hawke helped perfect in the Before movies so you never feel like youre watching movie stars pretending to be parents. They feel like a real couple with a rocky history behind them trying to work out their differences for the sake of their children. Boyhood understands the tumult of puberty and adolescence as well as it does the hurdles and satisfaction of raising children. The miracle Linklater pulls off is that the picture (which runs almost three hours) will fascinate viewers of all ages whether its reminding you of your parents or evoking what its like to nurture a family. The movie is filled with seemingly inconsequential moments that make you smile in recognition such as Masons quiet tantrum when his father tells him hes not giving him his GTO or a scene in which Mason and some friends find a sawblade and start throwing it around (boys play such potentially dangerous games its a wonder so many of them grow up to become men). The movie isnt all warm hugs and nostalgia. Linklater reminds you that growing up has plenty of unpleasant hardships too. But he avoids all the expected cliches -- Masons first crush his first kiss the loss of his virginity -- in favor of dinners and outings and the sort of simple moments that mysteriously stick with you for no apparent reason other than the way you felt at the time. When a mopey Mason asks his father what life is all about his dad replies ""Were all just winging it. The good news is youre feeling stuff you know? And youve got to hold on to that. You get older and you dont feel as much your skin gets tough."" This remarkable wonderful movie helps you remember. Cast Ellar Coltrane Patricia Arquette Ethan Hawke Lorelei Linklater.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A boy of 6 grows into a young man of 18 over the course of a single film. Rated R for sexual references and teen drug and alcohol abuse. BOTTOM LINE Richard Linklaters latest feels more like living a life than watching a movie. Its a one-of-a-kind experience. CAST Ellar Coltrane Ethan Hawke Lorelei Linklater Patricia Arquette LENGTH 244 Early in Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood"" little Mason Evans Jr. played by Ellar Coltrane bids farewell to his small Texas hometown and moves with his family to Houston. Upon arrival something has changed. Mason suddenly looks taller bigger older. What happened? Where did the time go? If youre a parent you probably know the feeling. ""Boyhood"" filmed bit by bit over 12 years with the same principal cast follows Masons journey from a wide-eyed first-grader to a thoughtful young man entering college. The characters and events are fictional but the transformations are real. Mason and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors scene-stealing daughter) grow in leaps and bounds over the course of the film while the actors who play their separated parents -- Ethan Hawke as Mason Sr. and Patricia Arquette as Olivia -- become grayer heavier slower. As the film rolls forward the effect is breathtaking and heart-wrenching and the power only increases after its over. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Scene for scene ""Boyhood"" can feel modest even underwhelming. Compelling story lines begin (Marco Perella plays Masons troubled stepfather) but are never resolved. Little vignettes like the bullies in a school bathroom never spell out a consistent theme. In any other movie this would be a weakness but here its a strength. This is how life goes first in one direction then another. Sometimes life seems to have no direction at all as a teenage Mason discovers when adults start using high-pressure words like ""future"" and ""job."" A proper narrative would make ""Boyhood"" feel false contrived. Its absence feels real. There has never been a movie like this (Britains ""Up"" documentaries which have tracked the same subjects since 1964 come close) and given the scope of the project there probably never will be. ""Boyhood"" is an ambitious artistic undertaking but its also the rare movie that could resonate with nearly anyone of any age. Its the sight of a life literally flashing before your eyes.

On the contrary it stays light on its feet and unceasingly curious about its central figure--Mason (Ellar Coltrane) a Texas kid whose fortunes we follow from first grade to the dreamy start of college. It is chastening to be reminded just how rough that ride can be physically as well as emotionally; now and then as we jump from one year to the next and as Masons height or his haircut makes a similar leap he barely seems like the same person. Other figures jostle and nudge him along principally his sister (Lorelei Linklater) his devoted (if finally exhausted) mother (Patricia Arquette) and his semi-absent father (Ethan Hawke). Linklater delves into detail and yet as so often in his movies the fundamental things apply How does somebody grow? Whats on the ledger of loss and gain? Do we live and learn or is the living hard enough on its own? Pals teachers sour stepdads and early girlfriends come and go caught up like Mason in times current. What a relief to find him emerging intact at the end with happiness still in reach.      --Anthony Lane Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Twice--in 2004s Before Sunset and 2013s Before Midnight--he revisited the star-crossed lovers of his best film 1995s Before Sunrise cataloguing at nine-year intervals the evolving stages of Jesse and Celines relationship and the ways circumstances pulled them together and apart.With Boyhood Linklater has conducted a related experiment but he has done it across the span of a single film. He began shooting the picture in the summer of 2002 in his hometown of Austin Texas and he gathered his cast back together for a few weeks every year until completing the project in 2013. Ellar Coltrane plays Mason the titular ""boy"" whom we watch grow from ages six to 18; Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke play his divorced parents; and the directors own daughter Lorelei Linklater plays Masons older sister. As with the Before Sunrise sequels the principal actors played an active role in writing the script which unfolded like the filming itself over the course of 12 years.Related Story The Real-Life Moments That Made Boyhood The result is a fascinating exercise in fictive filmmaking one that cannot help but be compared to the seminal Seven Up documentaries directed by Paul Almond and Michael Apted. Indeed like a great many of Linklaters films dating back to his 1991 debut Slacker there is a powerfully documentary-like feel to Boyhood an immersion in ordinariness that is itself extraordinary. Many moments in the film conjure with tactile immediacy the experiences both of childhood and of parenthood.Over the course of two hours and 45 minutes we watch as Masons baby-fatted cheeks gradually hollow as his voice deepens as his limbs extend into a lanky adolescence. (That last shift is so dramatic in the jump between two of the ""installments"" that the film momentarily seems almost to have changed actors.) Wisps of facial hair appear a dabbling in photography flourishes a girlfriend enters the picture--it is as if we are watching Mason grow up before out eyes because of course that is exactly what we are doing.More compelling still are the life changes undergone by his parents Olivia (Arquette) and Mason Sr. (Hawke). When we first meet the former she is a single mom struggling to balance work kids and the education she knows will enable her to get a better job. Mason Sr. by contrast breezes into the film in a black Pontiac GTO freshly returned from a year and a half in Alaska where he was working fishing boats and writing music. The striking (and I fear all too customary) imbalance between the realities of single-motherhood and single-fatherhood are presented pitilessly and will only grow starker as the film progresses.Indeed if theres a critique to be made of Linklaters film it is that it has a great deal more to say--or at least more interesting things to say--about grownups than about growing up. Remarkable as Mason Jr.s physical transformation may be socially and psychologically hes not all that different at 18 from at six a taller more articulate version of the dreamy aimless boy whose teacher complained that he spent his time ""staring out the window all day"" but one whose life has developed in a relatively straight line--insofar of course as its had the opportunity to develop at all. Moreover it is obviously a tricky thing to cast an actor so young and commit to his development over the next dozen years and Coltrane never quite develops the gravitational pull to tether the movie. Yes his character is meant to be an unfocused youth but occasionally his comes across as merely an unfocused performance.Theres a powerful socio-cultural critique embedded in the film and its a shame that it is largely confined to the margins.Arquette and Hawke by contrast are deep in their comfort zones (the latter arguably a little too much so at times). Arquettes Olivia navigates parenthood like a maze in which there is no right path her options constricted at every turn her life never fully belonging to her. (As she complains to a boyfriend early in the film ""I was somebodys daughter and then I was somebodys fucking mother."") Hawkes Mason Sr. by contrast drifts along in absentee cool-dad mode to such a degree that the movies title could almost be a reference to him--until that is he belatedly decides hes grown up enough to trade in the GTO for a minivan and try it all over again. Indeed theres a powerful socio-cultural critique embedded in the film and its a shame that it is largely confined to the margins. Boyhood is a unique and worthy addition to Linklaters oeuvre. But I cant help but think there may have been a better movie still lurking in his accumulated footage one that with a mild shift in emphasis might have been titled more ambitiously Adulthood.

Twitter previousHow Colors SmellnextThe Rise of the Wedding Drone Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Mason (Ellar Coltrane) age 7 in Richard LinklaterOs BOYHOOD. Photo Matt Lankes IFC Films Boyhood review Linklater changes the game 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Boyhood Drama. Starring Ellar Coltrane Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. Directed by Richard Linklater. (R. 166 minutes.) Few filmmakers ever make a great movie. Fewer still ever make a movie that expands what movies can express. Richard Linklater does both with ""Boyhood."" This film is so different it really needs to be described. Its a fictional drama about a boy in Texas from age 6 through 18. Conceived from the outset as a 12-year-project it was filmed between 2001 and 2013. You see kids grow up. You see the adults get older. You see the phones and video games get more sophisticated. Nothing is flashed onto the screen to indicate the year. The film plays out like life one day flowing into the next. If great art consists of finding an ideal balance between planning and improvisation ""Boyhood"" is one of the cinemas glorious examples. Going in Linklater knew the general outline of his story but he didnt know that 9/11 would happen or that Lady Gaga would become famous or that Ellar Coltrane who plays the central character would become a handsome teenager. He worked with the actors he had and with the world as he found it. Nobody had ever done this. Other filmmakers most notably Francois Truffaut and Linklater himself (in the ""Before"" series) have filmed the same characters over the course of many years in various movies. But these were always snapshots of the current moment. Its a totally different experience to see characters aging scene by scene or to watch a brand-new movie and feel like you know more than the actors. More in Movies Sex Tape review Clever setup fails to reach climax Siddharth review The high price of poverty in India The Purge Anarchy review Bloody whack at social commentary Wish I Was Here review funny touching soul-searching Planes Fire amp; Rescue review OK for kids not so hot for parents This makes for a different kind of movie experience one that brings a sense of mystery and awe to routine moments. Patricia Arquette as the mother of two kids shows up in the first scene looking barely out of her 20s. Ethan Hawke gets out of a car and breezes up to a house younger than he looked in ""Before Sunset"" (2004). The most poignant aspect of movies has always had to do with time the way film seems to stop time but cant because nothing can. In ""Boyhood"" that poignancy that power is built into the design. The movie begins with life in progress. Mason is a 6-year-old living with his divorced mother and his precocious 8-year-old sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) who loves to torment him. The dramas are the dramas of daily existence not movie-scale drama but then normal life offers enough stress the tension of listening to Mom and her boyfriend argue in the next room or the agony of being uprooted from one city to another. Through boys eyes In one scene as Mason and his family drive away forever from the house he grew up in he looks out the car window and sees his best friend in the distance riding a bicycle and you get the full impact of that moment. The friend is in the carefree world of life-going-on while Mason has just been expelled from the garden. As the movie proceeds life plays out mainly though not exclusively through Masons eyes with men showing up at regular intervals - men who will become part of Mason and his sisters household if his mother so chooses. Its a catalog of disappointed and disappointing fellows lost in the world and lashing out. ""Boyhood"" is a reminder of how powerless it feels to be a kid standing to the side watching. Rare adult As the breezy father who comes in every other weekend bringing nothing but fun and acceptance Ethan Hawke is a delight showing how the journey from youth to responsibility doesnt have to be soul-crushing after all. Hawke talks to the kids with the same energy and enthusiasm that he brings to his conversations with Julie Delpy in the ""Before"" movies. He gives us that rare adult who can be natural and honest around kids. What a wonder to think these actors had these brilliant performances hatching in the can for years and no one knew about them. Theres an excruciatingly embarrassing scene between the father (Hawke) and his 15-year-old daughter in which he tries to advise her on the subject of contraception while she buries her face in her hands and cringes. Its a classic of its kind filmed five years ago and yet nobody is seeing it until now. Likewise consider Patricia Arquette. She has not been a major name in movies for about a decade and yet there she was year by year giving a great performance in a flat-out masterpiece and who knew? I suppose she knew. But what an extraordinary thing to be in possession of such knowledge years before anyone else. Watching Arquette here is like watching a generations hopes and struggles presented by an actress with a fullness of emotion and yet with utter matter-of-factness. As though in passing Arquette offers her physical self to the camera too - every fluctuation in weight; every new haircut fortunate and unfortunate; every new line on her face - with the openness and generosity of a true artist. The kid can act As for the boy Ellar Coltrane ... well Linklater got lucky. The kid can act. He also has a rare poise which you can see start to emerge when hes 12. When hes a teenager theres a memorable moment in which he comes home and his mother asks if hes been drinking. He says yes. She asks if hes been smoking pot. He says yes. She looks at him with amused appreciation - a kid whos not afraid to tell the truth. Anyway Im as reluctant to stop writing about this movie as I was to stop watching it At 166 minutes it flies by and you dont want to leave that world. But one thing is certain This isnt the last word. People will be writing about this film for years - and looking at it to discover the lost history of our time.

Related links Boyhood director Richard Linklaters big risk 25 best Texas movies of all time By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 416pm on Thursday Jul. 17 2014 Thursday Jul. 17 2014 Friday Jul. 18 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The one thing many first remark about Richard Linklaters Boyhood the Austin directors joyous and life-affirming love letter to adolescence and family is how he filmed it over the course of 12 years with the same cast. That is no easy feat but whats even more remarkable than the technical accomplishment is how he has managed to elevate the ordinary to the extraordinary the mundane to the magical turning everyday life into something worth celebrating.On paper not much happens over the course of the films sprawling 166 minutes. First-grader Mason (a remarkable Ellar Coltrane) like most kids his age is struggling to make sense of his world. His biological dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) is away in Alaska his single mom (Patricia Arquette) is struggling to make ends meet in Texas suburbia and older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) is simply annoying with her Britney Spears imitation.Mom moves down to Houston for a better job. Dad comes back in the picture looking for a way to reconnect with his family but shes soon dating a new guy Bill (Marco Perella). And so it goes over the next dozen years as little Mason struggles to find his way in the world and grows up in front of the audiences eyes trading the safety of boyhood for the mysteries of manhood.But theres no big epic event to push the plot forward. Theres no crisis to solve no movie-of-the-week illness. Instead there are haircuts and Harry Potter. Sure the outside world -- the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan the presidential election of 2008 -- intervenes occasionally but Boyhood is less about the international and more about the interstitial those small moments between the big ones.That shouldnt come as a huge surprise since Linklater from Slacker and Dazed and Confused through the ""Before"" movie series ( Before Sunrise Before Sunset Before Midnight) has long shown a gift for being able to convey the daily grind of life and getting older with wit and sensitivity. In that regard Boyhood is his greatest accomplishment. Linklater doesnt always go to expected places. Its perhaps no accident that Bill a professor lectures about Pavlovs dog because there are times when the audience may expect one thing and Linklater gives them something else. Supposedly free-spirited non-religious Mason Sr. is a big Obama supporter so later in the film when his girlfriends socially conservative church-going parents are introduced -- they give Mason Jr. a Bible and a gun as gifts -- it might be expected that were supposed to laugh at them.Yet thats not how it all plays out -- and Mason Sr. turns out to be pretty familiar with guns himself.The performances are for the most part impressive with Arquette especially capturing the whirlwind of a woman trying to keep her family together while simultaneously aiming for a career. But its the previously unknown Coltrane whos in nearly every scene who is a revelation. Whether as a curious child or a more taciturn yet thoughtful teen he makes Mason someone whom we feel we know. Its not just the acting and the writing that give Boyhood its lived-in authenticity. Music plays a big part in that as well and from the films opening moments using Coldplays 2000 hit Yellow through the Flaming Lips Do You Realize? and Gotyes Somebody That I Used to Know Boyhood sparks with the familiar sounds of the last decade.Despite the movies length the audience is left wondering whats going to become of this family theyve befriended over the preceding 12 years condensed to two hours and 46 minutes. So while its tempting to say that nothing happens in Boyhood that would be wrong. What happens is everything.

IFC Films Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Shot over 12 years aBoyhooda is a stirring reminder to cherish the passages of life (A) Jul. 17 2014 100am Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Theres a scene near the end of Richard Linklaters remarkable Boyhood that brings home the films cumulative emotional impact. A mother (Patricia Arquette) is sending her youngest (Ellar Coltrane) off to college and facing an empty nest. She breaks down then lashes out What happened to her life her dreams? How could both her kids be grown up?As the magnificent Arquette lets loose we feel the brunt of her pain because we feel like weve been there every step of the way.In a sense we have. For 12 years Linklater shot a linear story with the same cast encompassing the hopes fears and gloriously mundane passages of an early 21st-century Texas family. We see Mason (Coltrane) age before our eyes from 5 to 18. The result is a loosely worn wonder as close a facsimile to lived life as Ive ever seen in a narrative film. If the title werent already taken for the Roger Ebert documentary Boyhood could be called Life Itself. Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane in a scene from ""Boyhood."" IFC Films To say Boyhood wouldnt be that special if it were shot in a conventional manner is kind of like saying that elephant in the zoo wouldnt be so big if it werent so big. When you see Mason enter junior high school you gasp with recognition Good lord did he get tall all of a sudden. Boyhood overflows with such moments but theyre never stunts. In steering his characters and cast through more than a decade of setbacks and triumphs musical trends and fashion statements Linklater climbs into the mechanism of time and somehow condenses it and stretches it.Linklater has always had a thing for the gift of gab and the passage of time from the rotoscoped philosophical musings of Waking Life to the epically intimate trilogy of Before movies. But his vision has never felt as organically grounded as it does here. The magic is seamless. Theres no onscreen text to tell us what year were in; snatches of dialogue current events and the shifting pop culture landscape from Britney Spears to Lady Gaga clue us in.The movies time capsule moments can be unintentionally funny Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) takes the kids (Coltrane and Linklaters daughter Lorelei) to an Astros game and marvels at Roger Clemens defiance of Father Time. But the scene wasnt some kind of in-joke when it was shot; the allegations about performance-enhancing drugs hadnt yet surfaced. Only time could tell. (Well maybe some of us assumed it back then.)In other words it feels like a spontaneous moment the kind that gives Boyhood its quiet but deeply felt spiritual credo. Many of the storys big life events including marriages and divorces take place off-screen. Characters enter and exit. (Dallas actor Brad Hawkins gets a longer stint than most as a dad stand-in.)Its the small stuff that Linklater holds sacred and uses to show us that no moment is really small. Its no accident that the carefully chosen soundtrack includes the Flaming Lips ""Do You Realize??"" which reminds us ""everyone you know someday will die."" Like that song Boyhood gracefully reminds us to inhabit every single moment before it fades into the next.Boyhood (A)Directed by Richard Linklater.

Comments (9) click to enlarge Boyhood Recommended Video Rated R  162 minutes  2014 Filming periodically over 11 years writer-director Richard Linklater follows a Texas boy from first grade to high school graduation noting along the way how his mothers unhappy relationships with men color the boys own interaction with the opposite sex. The movie is being hailed for its novel production though in fact British director Michael Winterbottom beat Linklater to the punch with his superb little-noticed Everyday (2012) chronicling a working-class family over five years. That movie progresses more naturally than this one which cant afford to introduce a single character unless theres a significant payoff later. But Linklaters writing is typically warm and insightful and the cast is uniformly excellent including Ellar Coltrane as the quiet down-to-earth hero. With Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. By J.R.

That sounds like a load of pretentious hyperbole. But its not. Richard Linklater has taken an idea at once so simple yet so complex and turned it into a stunning movie about life nothing less.Again this sounds pretentious. Again its anything but.Linklater took 12 years to make the story of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) taking him from age 6 to age 18. Yes The director got the cast together every year for a dozen years shooting footage then sending everyone their separate ways only to reconvene the following year for more.Qamp;A Coltrane reflects on his 12-year roleThus when we see Mason hit puberty Coltrane is hitting puberty. As his parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) and sister (Lorelei Linklater Richards daughter) age its not a trick of makeup or special effects. They really are a year older thinner heavier different hair changing faces whatever kinds of transitions real people undergo during the passage of time.AZCENTRAL12 years in the making Boyhood earning rave reviewsAnd thats the thing This could have been an interesting parlor trick and not much more. Instead it is so much more. The temptation in shooting like this would be to tie each development to some sort of major life event a cliff-hanger to move the audience from one age to the next.Instead Linklater does nothing of the sort. Things happen of course -- the movie is almost three hours long. But they are the sorts of things that happen to many of us. This took great patience on the part of Linklater along with a lot of trust in his audience. Boy does it pay off.AZCENTRALWhen Boyhood began News from 12 years agoOlivia (Arquette) is divorced from Mason Sr. (Hawke) when the film begins. She will weather more stormy relationships but thats about as melodramatic as things get. Mason Sr. is the type of dad in divorces who cruises up occasionally in his black Pontiac GTO to take the kids out for something fun. Hes a rogue charmer perfectly willing to let Olivia do the heavy lifting of parenthood.AZCENTRAL5 essential films Richard LinklaterThat she does earning degrees and losing relationships while keeping the family afloat. Arquette like the rest of the cast is fantastic. There is a scene in which Mason is leaving for college. Olivia is obviously proud of Mason but instead of being outwardly happy she is angry and crying and says ""This is the worst day of my life.""AZCENTRALSomething for everyone 52 Fall films for 2014Exactly She captures the contradictions of parenthood in one sentence. Its like when Bart Simpson hurt himself while defying his parents order not to jump over a car on his skateboard. Marge comforts him while Homer shouts ""Marge Were mad at him""Mason is a sweet boy with soulful eyes. One of the pleasures of the film is how unpredictably he and by extension Coltrane changes. He becomes interested in photography finds a girlfriend loses a girlfriend gets a part-time job develops a deeper more complex relationship with his mother -- recognizable moments that are remarkable only for their ordinariness particularly in this context.Ellar Coltrane stars as Mason in the epic ""Boyhood."" (Photo IFC Productions)Mason simply grows up in other words. Linklater draws us into this boys life this young mans maturing and it is captivating. Were immersed in it almost as deeply as the characters. We are so accustomed to gotcha moments in movies that at first its difficult not to expect one to rise up and smack us in the face. That feeling passes however as we return the trust in Linklater that he has shown in us.Thats a gift. ""Boyhood"" doesnt tell us how to think or how to feel. It simply lets Mason live his life and allows us to be a part of it.

The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday reviews the film saying the result is ""monumental."" (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post) By Ann Hornaday July 17 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In the movie ""Boyhood"" we watch as a kid named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) grows up from a little boy into a nearly grown young man living with his mom and sister in a series of Texas towns solidifying his relationship with an unsteady father struggling through schools and step-parents and girlfriends and himself until in the films final scenes he starts college. Audiences might think theyve seen this kind of coming-of-age story before. But theyve never seen a film like ""Boyhood"" which in the hands of writer-director Richard Linklater turns from classic cinematic portraiture into something epic transcendent and monumental. Filmed for a few days every year over 12 years ""Boyhood"" breaks open a brand new genre a fictional drama contoured and shaped by reality; a lightly scripted ensemble piece executed by both professional and non-professional actors; an experiment in time narrative and cinematic practice that utterly transforms the boundaries of what film can look like and feel like and achieve. Perhaps the most amazing thing about ""Boyhood"" is that it draws no attention to its own lofty ambitions. Working in his signature style of observational understatement Linklater simply allows viewers to eavesdrop and watch unnoticed as Mason and his family go about their daily business. But within that simple premise Linklater discovers multiple emotions and meanings the film equivalent of a world in a drop of water. When ""Boyhood"" opens 6-year-old Mason -- dreamy easily distracted watchfully quiet -- is being harangued by his mom Olivia (played by Patricia Arquette) about his behavior in school while his bossy older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the filmmakers daughter) annoys him by singing Britney Spears over and over. When Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) shows up from working in Alaska he comes bearing gifts and the loosey-goosey aura of the circus coming to town. But as ""Boyhood"" progresses Dad begins to embrace fatherhood more seriously. One of the films most touching and funny scenes occurs in a bowling alley where the hapless father tries to engage Mason in a just-buds chat about the facts of life (""We can do this""). Indeed much of ""Boyhood"" has to do with how Mason becomes a man -- under the tutelage of his own childish but earnest father by watching the problematic men his mom becomes involved with and even within the context of the sexist epithet-laden rhetoric of his peers. By the time Mason now a deep-voiced teenager affects an earring blue nail polish and an artistic interest in photography viewers get the feeling that hes dodged at least most of the misogynist conditioning of a boys life. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Keep tabs on the films that received top honors from Post critics over the last year.

Ann Hornaday writes ""...Captain Fantastic leaves viewers with the cheering deeply affecting image of a dad whose superpowers lie in simply doing the best that he can."" Read the full review. Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Seamlessly constructed by Linklater and his longtime editor Sandra Adair ""Boyhood"" unfolds with the flowing unforced rhythms of a river or real life. The film moves with such fluid spontaneous ease that it takes a while to realize how overwhelming an enterprise it really is. Elaborating on the familiar time-lapse tropes of Michael Apteds ""7 Up"" documentary series and countless YouTube videos Linklater has refined that rhetoric to create not just a stunt but also a bona fide piece of cinema that works both as art and mesmerizing entertainment. Coltrane a non-professional from Linklaters adopted hometown of Austin is the clear star of ""Boyhood"" but Hawke and Arquettes performances are among the finest in both of their careers In many ways the movie is as much about their characters changing self-conceptions and complicated relationship as it is about Masons own blink-and-youll-miss-it youth. Because it was filmed in real time ""Boyhood"" organically reflects the material culture and political touchstones of the 90s and early 2000s -- the Iraq War the Obama-McCain campaign of 2008 Harry Potter. Over time the music changes from Spears and Weezer to Cee Lo Green and Daft Punk becoming a vividly compressed time capsule of social history tastes and pop signifiers. But mostly ""Boyhood"" is about someone finding himself -- or perhaps more accurately a self finding him. Linklater took a chance on casting Coltrane as a 5-year-old there being no guarantee that he would be as cute or charismatic as an awkward college freshman. Luckily hes watchable at every age encountering milestones big and small with watchful reflective intensity. Some of those milestones are obvious such as the 15th birthday when Mason receives a Bible a blue suit and a 20-gauge shotgun from his family. But most are small -- those fleeting quotidian interludes that no filmmaker other than Linklater would deem worth noticing let alone valorizing as worthy of narrative attention. Like his fellow Austinite Terrence Malick Linklater is interested in philosophical questions about time and family and identity and consciousness. But unlike Malicks similarly themed ""Tree of Life"" ""Boyhood"" is free of fussy auteurist gestures and self-conscious grandiosity. What makes Linklater great is that he possesses the modesty and confidence to simply observe banal otherwise forgettable non-events then invest them with scale and sweep and deep significance. As a film that dares to honor small moments and the life they add up to ""Boyhood"" isnt just a masterpiece. Its a miracle.     R. At Landmarks E Street Cinema and Landmarks Bethesda Row Cinema.

"Review Boyhood a compassionate cinematic gift about growing up - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Boyhood a compassionate cinematic gift about growing upBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News contributorPosted 07/17/2014 120000 AM PDTUpdated 07/23/2014 055747 PM PDT Related StoriesJul 21Boyhood director Richard Linklater discusses the making of his 12-year indie epicJul 15Richard Linklaters 12-year film project Boyhood""Boyhood"" is a cinematic gift a compassionate and sometimes amusing drama about growing up that extracts truths out of what appear to be lifes most random moments. Richard Linklaters revolutionary epic -- filmed in real time -- allows audiences to become like long-distance relatives who drop in every so often to see how Mason Jr. (newcomer Ellar Coltrane in a tone-perfect performance) is doing. Over the years we get to know this soft-spoken kid from Texas as he transforms from a wide-eyed 6-year-old to a questioning cynical 18-year-old. We also become fully enmeshed in the hopes dreams and problems of his estranged parents Mason Sr (Ethan Hawke) and Olivia (Patricia Arquette) along with his more demonstrative and trouble-prone sister (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter).The family basically becomes our own reminding us of similar experiences feelings and circumstances from our own pasts.Understandably much has been made about how Linklater took the bold some might say crazy step to film ""Boyhood"" using the same cast over a 12-year span. That Linklater received a green light for such a project is amazing; that this risk-taking venture works so well demonstrates why he is one of our most treasured filmmakers.Advertisement What Linklater has pulled off could be categorized as a revolutionary cinematic experiment. But its the seamless result that elevates its status to a landmark achievement one that gracefully deploys its technique without ever feeling contrived. There are no title sequences that pop up to decree ""four years later"" no obvious conversations in which some secondary character strategically blurts out ""My how big youve gotten."" It all unfolds so naturally none is needed. ""Boyhood"" is plotless yet full of purpose capturing the experience of growing up with honesty and humor. In short its one of the best most observant movies ever made about an American family.At the start ""Boyhood"" appears to be little more than an engaging series of mundane events strung together. It opens with 6-year-old Mason gazing up in the sky (remember that image) then relates ordinary events that range from squabbling with sister Samantha (Linklater) as she sings a horrendous version of Britney Spears ""Oops ... I Did It Again"" to Mason playing video games and looking at images of underwear models in catalogs. But as Mason grows up and moves from home to home with his mom and sister so does the movie. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) age 6 in Boyhood. (Matt Lankes/IFC Films) If youre looking for sentimentalized resolutions idealized relationships and romanticized musings about losing ones innocence youll be disappointed. Linklaters film is subtle as it acknowledges the importance of those in-between parts of living like a camping trip with dad or attending a college course with mom that make up a life. Linklater reminds us of the importance of embracing all those experiences even during those uneventful stretches that might not seem to hold much resonance.The elliptical road ""Boyhood"" travels might sound like the one Terrence Malicks more esoteric ""Tree of Life"" took us down. In a way some of the same turf is covered but dont let that scare you off. ""Boyhood"" never resorts to ill-conceived sweeping gestures that leave you scratching your head. No dinosaurs appear and theres ample dialogue that binds everything together.As in all of Linklaters films from ""Dazed and Confused"" to the Hawke-Julie Delpy relationship trilogy that began with the luminous ""Before Sunrise"" theres a documentary-like authenticity that heightens every scene from heated sometimes explosive exchanges between family members to surprise conversations that at first seem simply incidental but later carry greater weight. To make a gamble like this work you need a cast that doesnt overact a dedicated crew and the ability to create a look and feel that conveys a time and place. Music plays an essential role and were transported over time by a diverse and time-targeted soundtrack that sprinkles in songs from Coldplay to Arcade Fire.As for the cast Linklater always draws out Hawkes personal best and the actors endearing performance as a wandering dad who stumps for Obama and is surprised to find himself driving a minivan fits him well. Arquette reveals just how underrated shes been as she nails her role as the often exasperated overworked single mom with dreams of becoming a professor and bad judgment when it comes to men. Coltrane is an unfussy actor and never overplays his mumbly teen while Lorelei Linklater evolves naturally from being just a kid to a young woman.To show the advance of time the characters wardrobes and styles change but not in outlandish ways. Hawkes hair gets jelled back. Arquette wears more professional-looking clothes. Lorelei Linklaters hair changes color. Coltranes nails have polish on them.It all adds context delivering yet another existential point that ""Boyhood"" shares with us that we are all no matter our age still in the process of growing up and sorting out our place in the world. And given that we might as well fully embrace the fact there is no reliable road map to show us the way.Boyhood     Rating R Cast Ellar Coltrane Ethan Hawke Patricia Arquette Lorelei LinklaterDirector and writer Richard LinklaterRunning time 2 hours 45 minutesOpens In very limited release July 18 wider on July 25Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Boyhood Deliver Us From Evil Life Itself and More << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Boyhood Deliver Us From Evil Life Itself and More IFC Films Movies July 16 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Boyhood directed by Richard Linklater As Richard Linklaters family drama makes its way around the country the accompanying stories of its making will lure the curious -- stories about the dozen years he his crew and cast devoted to shaping and shooting of this movie. It was made off and on loosely adhering to the personal growth of the actor playing the boy at its center. Ellar Coltrane was in or near the first grade when his performance as Mason Jr. began. In the final shot hes a college freshman. The formal device sounds like a gimmick -- filmmaking that is holistic sustainable organic. The farm is the table the table is the farm and on and on. But to sit with this movie and witness the concentrated passage of time is to watch in a true moving way your life unspool before your eyes without fanfare or idealism or romance. The years pass with a simple cut as gradual and seamless as evolution itself. There is nothing quite like the brightness in Masons 5- or 6-year-old face when Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) finally comes to Texas to visit him and Masons sister Samantha (Linklaters daughter Lorelei). Its the face of Christmas mornings and surprise birthdays a face of innocence. Eventually you notice the lighting leaving it. Somewhere toward the middle of the movie a teenage Mason bounds down a flight of stairs -- his hair oily his face pimpled the pudginess that gave him a cherubs adorability having melted off his lanky frame -- and I gasped. Where did the time go? The audacity of the format belies the modest ambition of the story on display. Boyhood is actually the story of a single mother who wants the best for her children but also for herself. Masons father and mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) had children when they were very young. The relationship didnt work out. Mason Sr. went off to work in Alaska and drive cool cars. Olivia raises a family puts herself through college and twice marries poorly. The children are not the center of her universe. Theyre two enormous planets. Her children are growing and changing. So is she. Theres a moment when she looks at her young-adult son and says through tears something so deeply honest that it hurts not to be able to hold her. Mason Sr. enjoys the relative luxury of the non-custodial parent Hes aspired-to hes awesome and he gets to grow up and into fatherhood taking the kids camping and to post campaign lawn signs for Barack Obama in 2008. The breezy cool-guy routine Hawke does so well here is the opposite of Arquettes extraordinary micro-climates pride anger fear resentment surprise wonder disappointment and unconditional love sometimes right there in one reaction shot. The movie is called Boyhood but the world Linklaters conceived is grand enough to include the most poignant depiction of a single mother I can think of. The form here is the content. Linklater is almost philosophical about becoming who you are. His filmmaking tends to veer in and out of shagginess. Strong images dont come naturally to him. He is as they say a people person -- a man of places too. Mason Jr. Samantha and Olivia seem to tumble across Texas and as they do you wonder how the upheaval has wounded and strengthened them. Mason Jr. develops oddball distrust of systems and social conventions. Spiritually at least hes the son of Linklaters Slacker. He sits in the desert a plaintive pontificating unambitious teenager looking more or less for the meaning of life. The light in his face is gone. Twelve years later its moved to his soul. Land Ho directed by Martha Stephens and Aaron Katz Andrew Reed/Sony Pictures Classics Are you tired of death and insurrection and monkeys and machines of Jolie and Cruise? Do you wish you could experience some far-flung place that requires an actual passport? Does the idea of 90 minutes with a horny old Texan stoner and his milder-mannered Australian ex-brother-in-law having the time of their lives for a few days in Iceland appeal to you? Then by all means run to Stephens and Katzs comedy. Its one of the best happiest movies of the year. Youll exit better than high. Youll leave on a trampoline. The premise fits on a beer coaster. Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson) has a big body big money and a big mouth. He also has a big heart. Hes planned a trip to Iceland for him and his buddy Colin whos still sad about the end of his marriage and plans to sulk. But Mitch wins and to some extent so does Colin (Paul Eenhoorn). They experience the natural wonders of the country. They get drunk high laid and lost. They do some deep thinking. They dance. What Stephens and Katz achieve is done with a high degree of difficulty. They find the comedy in the odd-couple pairing of personalities and nationalities and tastes without losing the human thread that keeps Mitchs larger-than-life-ness from leaving the planet. Its funny when his volubility gets under Colins skin. But Colin too is human and he cannot resist his friends charisma. Neither can a lot of the respectfully drawn women whose paths Mitch and Colin cross. One of them a Canadian photographer (Alice Olivia Clarke) is so richly magnetic that you want to see the movie of her travels. Often a buddy movie has to find a dramatic gear to get an audience to care. But the scenarios arent pushed too hard and the filmmakers have worked out a number of bits for Nelson and Eenhoorn to improvise their way around. You always feel a blowup coming between them. But theyre having too much fun for Colin to stay mad. Yes this is yet another bromance but for people who remember when that was just called friendship. Life Itself directed by Steve James Magnolia Pictures Boyhood and Land Ho feel very much like the sort of introspective affirmation of existence Roger Ebert wouldve admired toward the end of his life. His film criticism had achieved an enviable capacity for empathy. His favorable opinions swelled after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2005 and they werent fashionable. But to read him was to read a man communing with movies at a higher emotional register particularly during the final years. James was present with a camera during this period. The resulting documentary adapts Eberts 2011 memoir and chronicles his Illinois childhood his years as an alcoholic Chicago journalist his professional marriage to Gene Siskel and his romantic marriage to Chaz Hammel-Smith. For James the movies less formally rigorous than a landmark like Hoop Dreams or an epic masterpiece like The Interrupters. Its an elegy a eulogy and a valentine one that honors some of the warts of Eberts character and presents Chaz as a pillar of loving reason. James skips the aftermath of Siskels death in 1999 -- the many attempts to fill his seat. We dont hear a peep from Eberts second partner Richard Roeper for instance. But it is generous enough to make Siskel a fully developed character. The passages about his rivalry with Ebert are the films strongest. They shared a complicated ambivalence with each other. Their fame simply compounds your fascination with their mutual fascination. Many people learned how to watch movies by watching them talk about what they watched myself included. Some of those people write about movies because Ebert empowered them to do so. Life Itself makes clear how much Ebert meant to moviegoers and moviemakers (like Martin Scorsese Gregory Nava and Ramin Bahrani) -- a lot. It also makes clear that Ebert didnt want to partake in a movie that sweetened who he was. Hed be proud to know that the movie of his life is sugar-free. Begin Again directed by John Carney Andrew Schwartz/The Weinstein Company So let me get this straight. The owner of an independent record label that once had a hand in discovering and distributing cutting-edge music is fired from his company. One night hes drunk facedown at a bar when suddenly he hears the music that saves his life. Its a young Englishwoman a guitar and a song. This is music so good that he peels himself up has a gander at the stage and envisions the unused instruments suddenly supplying accompaniment by playing themselves so the movie audience just sees a pair of floating drumsticks and levitating violin bow. After decades at the vanguard of cool this guy finds the woman so irresistible that he risks what little cachet he has left to record her debut record in alleys and apartments and rooftops. Those who arent amazed by his commitment and her integrity are laughing at the sheer preposterousness of it all. His attraction to her sound is like Mario Batali falling in love with a bowl of brown water and vegetables that he plans to sell to the world as minestrone. Keira Knightley plays the songwriter who happens to sing. For the first time this good actor really is just a bowl of water and celery. And Mark Ruffalo is the music veteran. He spends the movie careening around Manhattan in his vintage Jaguar a brown cigarette dangling from lips most of the time. The only other actor Ive seen play such a stupid part with this kind of admirable but ridiculous passion is well Mark Ruffalo. Who would flip for songs that would make Starbucks throw up its hands? Knightley has her heart broken by her old writing partner turned pop star (Adam Levine). Ruffalo is trying to fall back in with his estranged wife (Catherine Keener bitterly coupled again) and daughter (Hailee Steinfeld truculently teenaged once more). Neither woman is very good; both look miserable. Carney also made Once the most redundant musical romance in the history of the art form. It was the equivalent of ordering a replacement cable and having it come in a three-foot box of packing peanuts. The new movie is worse. Theres no cable. They play songs in open spaces as double acts of ingenuity and rebellion Screw the studio But we seemed to be hearing at least a partial recording of these sessions so the production conceit remains just that. And would Knightleys optimistic busker friend (James Corden) really pause his own stalled musical career to do sound and throw parties for her? The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you dont trust its priorities. Right before it cuts to Ruffalo squabbling with Knightley theres a cut to the act who follows her. Hes just a dude with a guitar but his voice is chowder by comparison. How can you respect a movie whose protagonist believes that Knightleys thin flat singing and her characters dear-blog lyrics are good one who envisions either the future of music or college tuition payments? Even Levines nasal bleat has charisma. With him and Corden and the dude with the guitar theres too much evident talent to take seriously the movies endorsement of Knightley. But after two weeks the movies on its way to becoming a hit in part Im guessing because of pop music-geek draws like Levine and Corden and partly because Knightley is meant to represent authentic artistic integrity. The putative villain is Ruffalos business partner whos played by Yasiin Bey the former Mos Def. Its utterly surreal to have a rapper be The Man. His terms differ from Knightleys. She wants to sell the album only for what its worth which is 1. Needless to say the people behind Begin Again are selling both the soundtrack and the film for many times more. But after only 20 minutes of this movie even her price feels steep. Deliver Us From Evil directed by Scott Derrickson Screen Gems Desperate to re-create the sensation of last summers The Conjuring this exorcism horror-thriller swears its true. If youve seen the posters the tag line is so enormous that youre free to think the words ""inspired by the actual accounts of an NYPD sergeant"" are the star of this movie. As it is you have to work hard to find Eric Banas name. But he and his not-terrible Bronx accent are in almost every scene. As Ralph Sarchie hes the very fit cop who pokes around crime scenes unaware that his penchant for hearing and seeing what others cannot are a calling against Satan. Sarchie gets mixed up in a lot of paranormal activity that walks right up to his doorstep where his wife (Olivia Munn) and daughter (Lulu Wilson) spend a lot of time without him. Thankfully theres a sexy demonologist priest (Edgar Ramirez) to help out wearing leather jackets drinking alcohol and taking deep drags on cigarettes. These two discuss Sarchies renunciation of God and the priests old life as a junkie. Together they uncover weirdness that leads to soldiers in the Iraq War. But its a conspiracy unworthy of your intrigue. Sarchie and his smart-ass partner (Joel McHale whose performance here was all done at the gym) are in one eye-rolling scenario after the next. Derricksons been here before -- he made 2005s The Exorcism of Emily Rose which is the best-worst demonic possession movie Ive seen and 2012s Sinister a pale The Shining knockoff in which evil body-snatches Ethan Hawke. This movie appears to have saved all of its money for the exorcism itself whose exhaustiveness is something to see. Its like watching two men try to put out a fire with water balloons. But this is cheap horror with none of the parental angst or memorable imagery that gave The Conjuring its kick. Deliver Us From Evil is content to be sick (hey self-cannibalism) and cheap. This is the sort of movie that leans hard on a sludgy hissing sound design to work your nerves (they just got on mine) and animals that leap out of nowhere to make you leap from your seat. If you didnt know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie the boot prints on your eardrums wouldve clued you in.

"Review Boyhood celebrates one boys life - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Boyhood  Video Boyhood feels like an American masterpiece Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Richard Linklaters 12-years-in-the-making ""Boyhood."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews Richard Linklaters 12-years-in-the-making ""Boyhood."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune By the midpoint of writer-director Richard Linklaters gentle marvel ""Boyhood"" the round-faced young Texas boy played by Ellar Coltrane has become a lanky plaintive teenager. Already an hour or so of screen time has floated by. Linklater made the film with a core group of actors over a 12-year period starting with the kids played by Coltrane and Linklaters daughter Lorelei Linklater at ages 7 and 9 respectively.They change so quickly these two. As the characters become teenagers before our eyes you find yourself wondering What became of the younger versions? You miss them already not because theyre extraordinary but because they are exquisitely ordinary which is another sort of extraordinary. Midway through youre struggling to remember what Coltrane looked and acted like on screen an hour ago before he stretched out before his voice changed before all those hours of video gaming when he was asking his father about the existence of elves. Along the way from boyhood to young adulthood in ""Boyhood"" the audience travels through the narrative with these characters named Mason and Samantha. They weather a good deal of churn in their home lives in between doing what millions of kids were doing the last few years. Listening to music. Arguing. Wondering if their blended family will ever really blend. Staying up until midnight dressed as Hogwarts wizards in training to buy a copy of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Its a series of eye-blinks from lower school to college.Everyone knows how precious life is and certainly the movies keep telling us that usually in a series of tidily constructed falsehoods designed for maximum extraction of tears. The plain-spoken magic of ""Boyhood"" shows rather than tells. It allows us to feel the passing formative years and the slow-drip accumulation of experience without going for the throat emotionally without amping up the conflicts the crises or resolutions. In the first scene Linklater shows us Mason on a school day afternoon waiting for his mother to pick him up. Hes lying on his back looking at the sky. Twelve years later hes still looking this time with someone next to him on the verge of a new chapter. When ""Boyhood"" begins Masons parents are long divorced. Patricia Arquette plays Olivia and her lack of pretense or affectation as a performer is perfect for this project. Packing up to relocate to Houston to be near her mother Olivia -- who eventually becomes a college professor -- enlists her kids in cleaning out their soon-to-be-ex-house. At one point Mason paints over a door frame the one with all the different heights and different dates marked in pencil. The moment is tapped just so.Masons father Mason Sr. (played by Ethan Hawke) is a glamorous sometime presence in their lives. At first he seems like a write-off a weasel and an eternal adolescent with a cool car (a GTO) and not enough money or sense of responsibility. Then like so much of ""Boyhood"" he changes on you reveals new colors adds on the years and even some wisdom. He remarries and has a baby boy; Olivia throws the dice on one alcoholic control freak of a new husband and then another. Yet she is not crushed by the machinations of the narrative; shes allowed some space to be a person as opposed to a pathos dispenser.""Boyhood"" does without the usual trappings of coming-of-age movies It contains no voice-over narration no ""Six Months Later"" on-screen signage. When we see Mason driving a car its a pleasant shock; hes driving already? Lectured and largely misunderstood by a string of temporary father figures Mason explores his interests through photography. ""Boyhood"" can be seen as Linklaters photo exhibit in motion fictional but true and honest on the theme of what it is was like for him growing up. The movies unusual gestation represents a significant portion of the directors life. He spent it well.Linklater has capitalized on time distance and intimate moviemaking throughout his career notably in the ""Before"" trilogy of ""Before Sunrise"" ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Midnight"" starring Hawke and Julie Delpy made between 1995 and 2013. Earlier Francois Truffaut introduced actor Jean-Pierre Leaud in the semiautobiographical role of Antoine Doinel in ""The 400 Blows"" in 1959 and they made four more Doinel films together across the next 20 years. The heavyweight in this long-term cinematic division remains Michael Apteds ""Up"" series documentaries made between 1964 and 2012 following the same group of British children (now well into middle age) beginning at age 7. Perhaps by chance this is where Mason begins the ""Boyhood"" story. Its a mosaic of Texas life encompassing Obama supporters and Bible- and shotgun-wielding Christians alike. I love ""Boyhood"" and I fully expect many people either to merely like it or actively not like it. There are moments when you wonder if Linklaters tact can be read instead as timidity. For all the ingrained talk and examination of divorce and its ripple effects theres very little raw emotion expressed even in the hairiest sequences. Coltrane and young Linklater are genial and touching screen company but audiences should not expect dramatic fireworks from them or the film itself. (By contrast Hunter McCracken and Laramie Eppler made the boyhood sections of Terrence Malicks ""Tree of Life"" a showcase for a more startling level of acting talent.)The way Linklater rounds out Olivias story feels vaguely patronizing or at least dismissive though clearly this wasnt the filmmakers intention. The idea I think was to remind us that wed better appreciate what and who we have in our lives while we have them. And while we can still remember what they looked like when they were very young.Some films fill 164 minutes with sound and fury signifying nothing. ""Boyhood"" (one minute shorter than the 165-minute ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" for the record) opts for a different approach. In completing this simple beautiful project Linklater took his time. And he rewards ours. mjphillipstribune.com""Boyhood"" - 4 stars MPAA rating R (for language including sexual references and for teen drug and alcohol use)Running time 244Opens Friday at AMC River East 21 Landmarks Century Centre Cinema Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Gaming Ethan Hawke Before Midnight AMC Networks Up (movie) Latest movie reviews Summer box office slump Review Sex Tape  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-boyhood-movie-review-20140716,0,6742342.column",200,boyhood23,boyhood,chicagotribune

Grade B+ Filmed over the span of a dozen years as its lead actor aged from 6 to 18 and his co-stars went through similar 12-year odysseys writer-director Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood"" is ambitious engaging fiction that aims to convey times mysterious effects on character. The film concentrates on a shy imaginative Texan named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) who becomes an artistic photographer and to a lesser extent his older sister Samantha (played by the directors daughter Lorelei Linklater). She morphs from a juvenile chatterbox into a wary assured observer who knows when to keep her mouth shut. The movie nimbly and often wittily trots through cultural progressions great and small. The Harry Potter saga builds from bedtime storytelling to cultural phenomenon. Digital devices invade each corner of the characters lives starting with eMacs at school and culminating in smartphones everywhere. If you glide on its airy flavorful surface and home in on its main strength - a father-son tale of uncommon humor and sensitivity - ""Boyhood"" can be a lovely affecting experience. The spectacle of watching Coltrane as Mason and Lorelei Linklater as Samantha grow by erratic leaps in a single feature possesses an innate fascination like glaciers thawing and meadows springing to life in time-lapse cinematography. Does it enhance the movies humanistic power? Not for me. ""Boyhood"" lacks cumulative oomph and climactic revelations. Even when scenes play out with fetching woozy humor or unconventional edge they dont often cut deep. We spend a lot of time with Mason - the movie runs for 164 minutes - but we rarely get beneath his skin. The film lacks a visual style to make us see things as he sees them. That would be a drawback for any one-man character study; its a double deficiency when that man is a photographer. As drama the film is often sketchy especially with its women. Masons mother is the prime catalyst for his lifes many changes. She evolves mostly off screen. Zoe Graham brings a fresh bright presence as Masons first serious girlfriend. Too bad we must guess what it means for her to break up with him. In interviews Richard Linklater talks like an avant-garde Seinfeld from the Lone Star state contending that nothing happens in his narrative. In fact a lot happens some of it hackneyed. Near the beginning Masons mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) uproots him and Samantha from an unnamed suburb and goes to college in Houston. That occurs shortly after their father her ex-husband Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) returns from living in Alaska where he mostly hung out and tried to write songs. Olivias remarriages and pursuit of an academic career buffet her children around. Mason Sr. becomes a steady if limited presence in their lives. Before long you feel that Hawke is coming to the rescue of the kids and the movie whenever his vintage GTO roars into view. Early on he blurts out his intention to develop an authentic rapport with his children and Hawke fleshes out just how he does it often with fun and games. This dads musical ambitions may fade when he starts to sell insurance but they pave the way for scenes that are at once humorous and exquisite - like a G-rated family singalong with his kids and second family including devout Christian in-laws. Hes supremely likeable when he unveils the ""Black Album"" CD that hes burned for his son from the former Beatles solo work. He wants Mason to imagine the band back together its members still balancing and supporting each other. Linklater a Tolstoy fan contradicts the masters dictum from ""Anna Karenina"" ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Mason Sr.s happy new family is individual. The men in Olivias unhappy house may change but the results are catastrophic in the same way. Her boys gradual acquisition of a sturdy sense of self - as a young man and an artist - stems partly from his resistance to the alcoholic threats of Olivias second and third husbands. But the movie is at its melodramatic worst when her husbands conflicts fill the screen. Its disappointing that the director of movies as wonderful as the ""Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight"" trilogy and ""Me and Orson Welles"" would caricature Olivias spouses. Arquettes performance as Olivia is full-bodied and vibrant; shes equally passionate though not always equally focused as a mother and a teacher. Where Linklater excels is in offhand statements and gestures that reveal the roots and growth of personality. The youthful Mason is magnetic because of his open wonder-filled expressions and his obsessions with artifacts and fantasy. As a tyke hes drawn to relics of the past like Indian arrowheads and determined to create something timeless all by himself. Hawke and Coltranes father-and-son chemistry is the glory of ""Boyhood."" They stir unruly brews of in-the-moment bliss nostalgia and inchoate yearning. At the movies peak the 16-year-old Mason is appalled to learn that his father sold the GTO to pay for a minivan. Because of a stray comment the boy overheard eight years before he thought his dads car would be his when he turned 16. Their disagreement is funny sad and troubling; it conjures an entire universe of longing regret and miscommunication. ""Boyhood"" at its best boasts qualities that are usually under-valued in avant-garde work tingling observations unforced comedy and quirky enduring charm.

This movie meant so much to me. I know that Linklatter took a big chance on this movie but yes a tap measure home run indeed. And in the midst of so many not so good movies these days. I am hoping you will add me to your email list. Thanks. maziesaid on Wednesday September 10 2014 75846 AMsmall movies such as these go unnoticed in my little town but somehow it made it here...and I for one am glad it did. its like watching him grow and struggle to understand who we are and what might be as we enter into our futures. the director doesnt sugar coat anything and the ensemble -- faults and all -- bring together what movies lack nowadays a lasting impression that sticks with you after the credits are over. the best movie not just for the year but the decade and beyond. Lensaid on Saturday August 23 2014 53557 PMI continue to be touched by this movie. Just out of the blue I will have intense feelings about it. I have never felt this way after seeing a movie and I have seen a ton A friend of mine saw it and didnt come away that impressed. I just now read your review and feel comforted that my impressions are not off base. DCWhatthesaid on Monday August 18 2014 105936 AMWow. Holy s How many movies are this long but you feel like the story is incomplete that you want more? It has elements of Reality TV without the narcissism. Plays something like a documentary but with an absorbing narrative and characters you care about. Real characters real challenges of growing up with actors who were able to pull it off. It truly doesnt get better than this at least so far. My favorite movie of the year as of August.

"Boyhood - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Boyhood Posted by Christy Lemire on July 13 2014 1 Comment IFC Films R for language including sexual references and for teen drug and alcohol use. Running time 162 minutes. Four stars out of four. Simply as a piece of experimental filmmaking ""Boyhood"" would have been fascinating. What Richard Linklater did was so inspired so risky and it could have gone so many different ways. Linklater shot this Texas coming-of-age tale using the same actors over a period of 12 years -- checking in with them between such disparate projects as ""Before Sunset"" ""Bad News Bears"" and ""Bernie"" shooting several minutes at a time in order to create the sensation of watching a life unfold on screen. Cast members could have pulled out changed their minds not wanted to be actors anymore gotten tied up with other projects. The biggest gamble of all was the young man at the films center and the subject of its title Ellar Coltrane. Chosen when he was just a chubby-cheeked little boy he could have been a bust as the years passed. Instead he blossoms vividly into a young man with ambitions and a particular worldview going through all the awkward adolescent stages and maturing right before our eyes. And by the end with his lanky frame chiseled cheekbones and facial scruff he bears a striking resemblance to Ethan Hawke Linklaters longtime friend and frequent collaborator whos been playing his father all this time. Its just one of many elements that make this film so quietly miraculous. We witness as Coltranes Mason goes from a first-grader to a college freshman and experiences myriad recognizable rites of passage moving away from friends he knows hell never see again; struggling to fit in at a new school; suffering that first bad haircut; savoring late-night kisses in the back of a car; enduring his first heartbreak; wondering what to do with the rest of his life. Its all the prosaic stuff of daily existence but its presented in such keenly detailed unadorned fashion that we find ourselves drawn in and emotionally invested. The cumulative sensation of caring deeply for this young man and the people around him ultimately sneaks up on you with a surprisingly profound punch. You truly feel as if you have gotten to know these people and that they are real. ""Boyhood"" begins with its signature image Mason lying on the grass in front of his elementary school looking up at the clouds and daydreaming while waiting for his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) to pick him up. A divorced single mom shes raising Mason and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) alone while the kids largely absent father Mason Sr. (Hawke) seeks work in Alaska. Sassy and scene-stealing Lorelei Linklater is a total natural the annoyed voice of reason but never in a way that seems studied or precocious. We follow this family as they struggle to make it in middle-class America from about 2001 to 2013 -- moving to Texas cities including Houston and San Marcos living in apartments and houses of various sizes studying at several different junior high and high schools. The choices Olivia makes are clearly always in the interest of improving her childrens lives -- of seeking a future for them thats better than the ones she and Mason Sr. ended up with for themselves as young ill-prepared parents. This includes aligning herself with a series of boyfriends and husbands who probably seemed like good ideas at the time but eventually reveal their true flawed selves. (Marco Perella as the divorced psychology professor who moves the family into a suburban Houston McMansion with his own two kids plays one of the most skeevy and sadistic characters Ive seen on screen in a long time.) While shes the hard-working anchor Mason Sr. is the cool dad -- rumbling into town in his muscle car taking the kids to the bowling alley or a baseball game all the while secretly acknowledging that hes not the most responsible reliable father in the world. But much of the beauty of ""Boyhood"" comes from its lack of judgement. Linklater is kind to his characters -- hes curious about them he cares about them so we end up feeling the same way as well. They make mistakes and enjoy minor successes along the way without the dramatic milestones that mark more traditional narratives which makes the entirety of the films arc feel relatable and true. Yes I said ""entirety."" Dont feel daunted by the running time you see at the top of the page. ""Boyhood"" is nearly three hours long but it breezes by and by the time the credits roll you actually wont want it to be over. Youll want to continue following these people to learn how their lives turn out. The sense of naturalism that permeates ""Boyhood"" is reminiscent of Linklaters groundbreaking 1991 debut ""Slacker"" with its shaggy vibe and easygoing pace. Its filled with conversations that dont necessarily further the plot but rather provide a slice of life some relevant pieces of political and pop culture and a glimpse into the way people communicate with each other. Linklater even returns to Austin for a segment when Mason is in high school walking the music-filled streets all night with his girlfriend whos planning to attend the University of Texas the next fall. In many ways ""Boyhood"" feels like a richer more emotionally mature ""Slacker"" -- a ""Slacker"" with ambition if youll pardon the contradiction. But even making that comparison seems insufficient. ""Boyhood"" is a singular masterful work of art. Linklater and his team have done something incredibly difficult and made it look effortless. The result is easily one of the best films of the year.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 11 2014 Save for later Saved Boyhood character Mason and actor Ellar Coltrane both came of age during the dozen years over which the film was shot. IFC Films          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I have long maintained that Richard Linklater is the most gifted and audacious director of his generation. His new movie ""Boyhood"" which runs 2 hours and 44 minutes is a stunning reconfirmation. Shot during 39 days over a stretch of 12 years it dramatizes the life of a Texas boy Mason as he ages from 6 to 18. Mason is played by Ellar Coltrane who had never acted before. He grows up before our eyes. No CGI no trickery of any kind - just the stark serenity of observing aging at work. The featured actors all went along for the 12-year ride Patricia Arquette as Olivia and Ethan Hawke as Mason Sr. the boys divorced parents; and Lorelei Linklater (the directors daughter) as Masons slightly older sister. Much could have gone wrong here - the financing could have fallen through; Linklaters scenario could have meandered nowhere interesting; actors could have dropped out of the project or even died. The fact that the film for the most part is a triumph owes something not only to luck and Linklaters tenacity but also to the very nature of the project itself. Linklater has always been captivated by the mysterious passage of time in his movies no more so than in his great ""Before"" trilogy filmed over 18 years and starring Hawke and Julie Delpy. But ""Boyhood"" is something else again a movie about times passage that is itself an expression of that passage. Its the ultimate time-travel movie into the future a ""flowing time sculpture"" in Linklaters own words. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time It would have been discordant if Linklater had ginned up the film with melodramatic twists. He is after something far more elusive - the way drama plays itself out in the mundane dailiness of its characters lives. He wants us to recognize that it is the small moments and not the big engineered ones that impart a larger meaning to the whole. The film in a sense is a rebuke to the way Hollywood traditionally manufactures its entertainments and yet it doesnt come across as artier-than-thou. This is simply (and most profoundly) Linklaters way of seeing. For him the resonance of life resides in the quotidian. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The films exposition is linear but there are large elisions in the story line. Olivia single and seeking college-teaching credentials moves her family around Texas from Houston to San Marcos to Austin acquiring and ditching two post-Mason Sr. abusive husbands along the way. (The adults in this movie are just as confused as the kids.) Mason goes from first grade to first love as a college-bound high school senior. Scenes glide into each other as the actors looking somewhat older at each turn pick up at different points in their characters lives. This technique keeps us off guard but the progression is purposeful. To take just one example The film begins with Olivia reading the first ""Harry Potter"" book to her two young children in bed. Some years later the kids are lining up at midnight to buy ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" After Mason having in the interim acquired a sullen watchfulness morphs into a teenager his literary tastes turn to Kurt Vonnegut.Linklaters risks in this film are as much aesthetic as practical and occasionally they dont pay off. Sometimes banal is just banal. There are boring stretches during which I would have welcomed a little Hollywood hoo-ha. (Potential ""big"" moments such as Olivias physical abuse at the hands of her alcoholic second husband played by Marco Perella happen off-screen.) Linklaters dramatic technique here isnt necessarily any more revelatory than more conventional methods employed by such film artists as Francois Truffaut who in his ""Antoine Doinel"" series could transmit the passage into adulthood without taking 12 years to record one film. And for all the fascinations of seeing Coltrane come into his own there were times when I wished a trained actor had played the maturing Mason. His performance unlike those of most of the others has documentary rather than dramatic power.Linklater is certainly smart enough to recognize these aesthetic pitfalls. When he has a high school photography teacher chew Mason out by telling him that any jerk can take pictures but ""its hard to make art"" Linklater is also implicitly throwing down the gauntlet for this film. Its faults are inseparable from its virtues and are niggling beside them. There are moments that are extraordinarily affecting out of all relation to their brief time onscreen such as the scene when Mason before moving out of his childhood home paints over the height marks on his bedroom wall. ""Boyhood"" is a movie that will I expect seem an even richer experience as it marinates over time in my mind. This has often been true for me with Linklaters films and I think its because his artistry is all about overtones - about the sounds we hear and the images we hold after the large chord has been struck. This movie is saying that in the end what is fleeting is what stays with us. Grade A (Rated R for language including sexual references and for teen drug and alcohol use.)

IFC Productions hide caption toggle caption IFC Productions Ellar Coltrane -- pictured here with screen family Ethan Hawke and Lorelei Linklater -- grows from boy to man on-screen in Richard Linklaters new Boyhood. IFC Productions Filmmaker Richard Linklater breezed through plenty of genres in his career establishing that hes comfortable making loose comedies like Slacker animated sci-fi thrillers like A Scanner Darkly and even messing with longer-form studies in time with his Before trilogy Before Sunset Before Sunrise and Before Midnight. Still its safe to say that hes never done anything even remotely like Boyhood his latest film because neither has anyone else. It sounds like the most ordinary of stories just a boy growing up. Whats not ordinary is the way its told. We meet Mason as a cute 7-year-old in Texas rambunctious giggling with a friend over the busty women in his moms lingerie catalog and played by youngster Ellar Coltrane. We will leave Mason almost 12 years later by then slender tall a serious young man -- and still played by Ellar Coltrane. Linklater started filming in 2002 and finished in 2013 shooting just a few days each year (39 in all about what hed have shot for a more conventional film) with Ethan Hawke playing Masons dad Patricia Arquette playing his mom and Ellar Coltrane not just playing but more or less living the boy whose boyhood gives the film its title. Initially little Masons got a sweetly natural innocence and vulnerability when his mom for instance lets him and his sister Samantha (played by the directors daughter Lorelei Linklater) know theyll be moving to Houston and that Dads not coming with them. Dad does however want to be part of their lives even if every second weekend when he shows up in his vintage Pontiac GTO to take them out hes playing catch-up. Queries he puts to the kids get answered in monosyllables and he does not want to be the biological father who gets polite conversation when he drives places and buys stuff so he pulls the car over and begs the kids to talk to him. He even suggests what they might say -- about arguments theyve had on the playground trouble theyve had with schoolwork. You can hear him projecting. And so can 7-year-old Mason. ""But Dad I mean why is it all on us though?"" he wonders. ""What about you? How was your week? You know who do you hang out with? Do you have a girlfriend? What have you been up to?"" Dad concedes he has a point and agrees to try to connect ""more naturally."" And for the balance of the film thats pretty much what happens. Life happens -- scripted according to a plan the filmmaker laid out at the beginning and unscripted according to a plan nature lays out in real time. As Mom and Dad grow thicker Mason grows taller more angular. His face loses its baby fat. And on a camping trip around the films midpoint with a casualness that is likely to choke up every parent watching his voice changes. Now the usual way to show a kid aging a dozen years in a movie is to use several actors -- one for childhood another for adolescence a third for late teens. But Linklaters managed something enormously richer and more resonant with what sounds like a stunt until you actually see it. Sure other characters have grown up on-screen -- in documentaries and on TV shows that hang around forever. But not like this. Not sculpted and controlled with a dramatic arc that must have given everyone fits as they filmed across more than a decade hitting milestones that deepening of the voice a passion developed in school for photography Mason flirting with a girl at his first job and getting his heart broken at 15 not by her but by his dad. When he asks why theyre cruising in a minivan rather than the GTO his father says he sold the car hed long since forgotten hed promised to give to his son when he turned 16. So much pain in one accusative phrase ""You dont remember?"" It seems almost odd to talk of performances when theyre as natural and unforced as they are in Boyhood but theyre fascinating with the adults nearly as physically altered by time as the kids. So are the offhand glimpses the film gives you of a decades worth of music video game consoles and cellphones. The picture is so unassuming and understated as it wends its way through a dozen years in the life of this family -- in all our lives really -- that youre likely to be surprised at how invested you feel -- how proud and conflicted -- when Mason finally stands on the brink of adulthood. The film gives every appearance of happening exactly the way life does. And exactly the way life does it makes you care.

You really do. Summer escapism baby But sometimes movie buffs want -- no need -- a break from the ear-splitting bonanzas. (And if nothing else a movie that doesnt run the same length of time as a trans-Atlantic flight). For a blockbuster tonic try these five nifty gems. Theyre all bright and heartfelt and theyll whet your appetite for the upcoming Oscar season. (Just two months to go Not that were counting. But we are For real Gone Girl better be good). PHOTOS Summer 2014 movie preview 1. BoyhoodIn theaters Friday July 114 stars (out of 4 stars) Director Richard Linklater spent 12 years filming his actors for this slice-of-life drama -- and oh is it ever worth the wait. The laid-back epic chronicles Mason (Ellar Coltrane) a curious first grader who grows up before our eyes into a confidently cool college freshman. Theres mastery in the way his journey unfolds Instead of flashy contrivances we watch Mason and his divorced parents (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette also aging in real time) and sister (Lorelei Linklater the auteurs daughter) organically take on day-to-day highs (graduations birthdays) and lows (sour relationships) in one seamless whirl. Anyone can relate to the familial themes; everyone will be moved by the experience. This is more than a groundbreaker Its a new American classic. 2. Life ItselfIn theaters now and Video on Demand3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) For decades Roger Ebert was one-half of the most famed and influential movie critic teams in the country. Yet as this riveting documentary proves two thumbs up made up only a small part of the total man. Director Steve James (Hoop Dreams) not only highlights the proud Chicagoans colorful career he takes his camera inside Eberts hospital room as he gets treated for salivary gland cancer. Though he cant speak or eat Ebert uses his dry humor (he types about the joys of being fed via ""suction"") to persevere right until his death in 2013. His heroism is the stuff movies are made of. PHOTOS TV to movie stars -- then and now 3. Begin AgainIn theaters now3 stars (out of 4 stars) Sometimes all it takes to recover from the depths of despair is one meaningful song. Thats the premise behind this soulful outing from the writer and director of Once. In a dingy NYC bar a drunk newly fired Aamp;R exec (Mark Ruffalo) snaps to it when he hears a songwriter (Keira Knightley) strum a ballad about loneliness. After she agrees to record an album with him the pairs creative juices ignite. The dramas overt earnestness is sure to please music lovers (isnt that everyone?). As for the music its a bit coffeehouse wisp -- until Adam Levine (playing Knightleys pop star ex) takes the stage to belt a soaring number called ""Lost Stars."" Bravo. Keira Knightley and Adam Levine in Begin Again (c)2014 The Weinstein Company PHOTOS Adams hottest pictures 4. They Came TogetherIn theaters now and Video on Demand3 stars (out of 4 stars) Lovelorn ""handsome in a non-threatening way"" Joel (Paul Rudd) and adorably klutzy Molly (Amy Poehler) bump into each other on the street fall in love split before the holidays and then make up via a grand public gesture. If it all sounds familiar thats the point. Starting from the glistening aerial shot of Manhattan this film knowingly and cleverly spoofs every rom-com cliche this side of When Harry Met Sally. . . (Naturally the two kibbitz in a bookstore too.) The irreverent jokes are often fiercely funny -- and prodded along by the sparkling gung-ho leads. Well have what theyre having. PHOTOS Most successful SNL cast members ever 5. Obvious ChildIn theaters now3 stars (out of 4 stars) Its okay if the only thing you know about this indie is that Lena Dunham recently criticized NBC execs for refusing to air an ad for it. Beyond the controversy lies a wonderfully offbeat film about yes an abortion. Jenny Slate plays a stand-up comic who in short order gets dumped by her boyfriend and loses her job. Her life unravels further after a drunken one-night stand (Jake Lacey) leads to an unwanted pregnancy. To be sure this is indeed a romantic comedy and Slate has a low-key self-deprecating charm about herself. The delicate subject matter meanwhile is handled with humor and heart. Just one issue Why didnt anyone cause a ruckus about the excessive poop jokes? Icks.

Literally (IFC) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 11 2014 at 128 AM updated July 11 2014 at 1022 AM comments ""Be in the moment"" acting teachers tell their students and the most dedicated try earnestly. Yet it has the tricky twist of a Zen koan As long as youre thinking of being in the moment you will never truly be in the moment. And ""Boyhood"" is about being in the moment -- not as actors (although there are some fine performances here) but as human beings. Your child is proudly showing you his arrowhead collection; thats a moment. Your nasty second husband is forcing a crewcut on the kid; thats a moment too. Our lives are made up of moments and if we dont see those small pictures well never see the big one either. Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood"" is a marvelous minimal epic of a movie that was literally 12 years in the making; using the same small core cast (plus other actors who come in and out) it follows a boy through childhood beginning in first grade and ending on his first day in college. Other films -- like the sublime ""7 Up"" documentaries or Francois Truffauts fictional features with Jean-Pierre Leaud -- have revisited characters. But I dont know of any other single film thats done this compressing a maturation into not quite three hours of incident and reflection. It begins when Mason -- Ellar Coltrane in a truly unique performance -- is simply on his back staring up at the clouds. Quickly the facts are sketched in -- he has a single mom an older sister and lives in a not-great rental in Texas they cant quite afford. But slowly the rest of the portrait emerges in flashes -- and its even more messily real. His self-sacrificing mother is devoted to her children (but has terrible taste in men). His would-be rock musician father is undependable -- yet loving easy with his kids and full of real concern. There are no nags or wastrels here. Just decent people who might have had a great and wonderful life together if they met at 30. But they didnt. They met too young and started too young and now shes a college drop-out unable to get a good job and hes wandering wondering trying to recapture the roaring 20s he put on hold. Linklater doesnt use titles or obvious cuts to indicate the passage of time but he doesnt really need to and young audiences will pick up every cue (I saw the film with my 20 year-old who recognized every fashion style every pop song). Its nostalgia for millennials. And the cast is superb because -- filmed over a dozen years -- they are so honest so unselfconscious. Patricia Arquette playing the mom gets a bit stocky; dad Ethan Hawke has grey creep into his hair. And newcomers Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter survive acne bad haircuts and outre piercings. What happens to these folks? Nothing much actually except life -- although a lifetime of Hollywood movies puts us on edge. As you watch -- and see one drunken character get behind the wheel or another unwrap the birthday present of a shotgun -- you begin to wait for the tragedy. The melodrama. The hand of the scriptwriter. Instead people go on. The worst things that happen are some bad marriages and one brief (offscreen) bit of domestic violence; the best are the sort of small triumphs we all too easily take for granted. A happy camping trip with a child. The second prize in an art show. A new job. N.J.

As the story begins to pull to a quiet and yet fully satisfying -- close Arquettes character begins to fray a bit at the edges. Shes single again. Her children are off living their own lives. She looks back at a life of moments -- a wedding a childbirth a graduation -- and tearfully announces that the next big event in her life will be the end of it. Mom her son says I think youre rushing things by about 40 years. She is. And those 40 years will be filled with even more moments -- some happy some sad most inconsequential yet still the tiny incidents that make up our days. Which is why in the end everyone needs to live in the moment. Because its the moments that make up life. Ratings note The film contains substance abuse and strong language. Boyhood (R) IFC (166 min.)

It has been substantially revised and rewritten.You may be better off seeing Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood"" without much advance preparation the way I did at Sundance last January. But given that this 12-year mini-epic of family life has been widely pronounced as the independent film of the year I think the cats out of the bag. Theres always considerable danger in proclaiming the greatness of a work that presents as modestly as this one does. ""Boyhood"" wants to sneak up on you and steal your heart but its fundamentally a story about ordinary life in nondescript Middle American suburbia. Were a long way from the terrain of ""Citizen Kane"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Vertigo"" - works of supreme craftsmanship that sweep you up with their first shot or opening scene.There isnt anything else quite like ""Boyhood"" in the history of cinema although that wouldnt matter one-fifth as much if it werent a moving and memorable viewing experience in the end. It was added to this years Sundance and Berlin lineups at the last minute largely because Linklater didnt finish shooting it until October of 2013. That marked the end of a remarkable production process that went back more than 4000 days to 2002 -- but included only 39 days of shooting. The idea was dramatically simple but logistically so close to impossible that no one had ever tried it before Follow the life of a boy and his unexceptional Texas family from childhood to adulthood but do it in real time bringing the cast back together every year to film new episodes.So during the making of ""Boyhood"" young actors Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater -- the directors daughter now an adult -- went from being elementary school-kids to college students just as their brother-and-sister characters do. As their parents Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke visibly change too going from impulsive attractive and self-destructive ex-spouses going through a painful split to all the compromises devils bargains and minivan purchases of middle age.I felt nearly as crushed as teenage Mason Jr. (Coltrane) when he learns near the end of the film that his dad Mason Sr. (Hawke) now remarried with a new baby has sold the vintage black Pontiac GTO that defined him as a younger man. (I was grateful to learn that in real life the GTO belongs to Richard Linklater who hasnt sold it and doesnt plan to.) In fact -- and this is the beauty and the emotional range of ""Boyhood"" -- I felt I was experiencing that moment from both guys perspective at the same time. Of course the upgrade to a Toyota Sienna or whatever makes sense in the context of Mason Sr.s real life. (And he made a killing from selling that GTO) Still its a painful moment of disillusion and one the quiet and introverted Mason Jr. will carry with him deep into adulthood.""Boyhood"" runs long - more than two and a half hours - and while Id hate to lose a minute of it I realize that poses a legitimate obstacle to many potential viewers. As has always been the case in Linklaters independent features from ""Slacker"" onward he doesnt want to cut to the next scene right on the emotional beat. After the family blowup or whatever hes willing to hold the scene for another minute or three while someone pours a bowl of cereal or waters the plants or starts to consider what the hell theyre having for dinner. Im not here to tell you how to feel about that but capturing the texture of ordinary life - the moments that would be excised from any normal movie - is pretty much the point. Taken cumulatively those moments contain the movies magic. You Might Also Like Thats how Linklater makes this tale of ordinary American family dysfunction -- a tale of divorce and remarriage of families blended and broken of first love and heartbreak and awkward ballgame outings and camping trips that go unexpectedly well -- into something transcendent and universal. This movie contains almost none of the things that are considered ""dramatic"" in motion pictures. Nobody dies or commits a felony and nothing blows up except Fourth of July firecrackers. As a Texas chronicle of joy and tragedy and loss and time this movie is at least as profound as Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" and a whole lot easier to wrap your head around.Mason Jr.s transit from boyhood to manhood provides the narrative spine of the film and Ellar Coltrane matures into a moody dreamboat-handsome young actor who holds the cameras gaze. But ""Boyhood"" is covertly a story of parenthood about the quite different maturation process of the two adults Mason Sr. and Olivia (Arquette). Theyre a couple who got married too young and have already hit Splitsville by the time we meet them and both are flawed and complicated characters for whom we feel immense compassion. Hawkes Mason Sr. is an essentially likable dude and in most respects a better dad than the sequence of abusive alcoholic husbands Olivia tries out later. But for most of the journey hes also a semi-employed and unreliable deadbeat with a cool car who wants to experience all the most fun and dramatic parts of fatherhood without putting in the work.Our sympathy flows more naturally toward Olivia an undeniably heroic single mom with a pattern of dubious decision-making. Part questing spirit and part nesting instinct she keeps pushing her kids around the Lone Star State in quest of an elusive dream of normalcy and stability before understanding she must create and define those things for herself. Arquette gives a wonderful fearless performance and has been very funny about facing the challenges posed by playing the same role as she herself went from her early 30s to her late 40s. In some alternate universe where a compassionate God suspends all the rules we can imagine Mason and Olivia finding their way back to each other; they seem to like and respect each other more at the end of the story than the beginning. ""Boyhood"" isnt a documentary but it includes pieces of real history a midnight Harry Potter book-sale the Obama election of 2008 an otherwise unmemorable Houston Astros game featuring a perfectly timed home run. If you find yourself on this movies wavelength youll feel as I do that it comes awfully close to a masterpiece of American moviemaking and an entirely new use of cinematic time. One of the precedents I suppose is the love-and-marriage trilogy beginning with ""Before Sunrise"" that Linklater has made with Hawke and Julie Delpy across 18 years although those tell discrete stories separated by many years. ""Boyhood"" is something else again almost a combination of Michael Apteds ""Up"" documentaries Ingmar Bergmans ""Fanny and Alexander"" and Orson Welles ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" but translated into Linklaters Texas-Zen aesthetic and the world of the 21st-century American family. In its own quiet way its a world of marvels.""Boyhood"" opens this week in New York and Los Angeles with wider national release to begin July 18. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Review Boyhood an intimate portrait of child growing into a man - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Boyhood a startling intimate portrait of a child growing up Boyhood review Matt Lankes / IFC Films Ellar Coltrane left and Ethan Hawke in ""Boyhood."" Ellar Coltrane left and Ethan Hawke in ""Boyhood."" (Matt Lankes / IFC Films) Richard Linklaters Boyhood was 12 years in the making capturing a young boy growing up There is a telling scene deep inside ""Boyhood"" that gets at the essential core of the emotional appeal of Richard Linklaters startling new film. It takes place in a rural church with a pastor sermonizing about doubting Thomas and faith and those who believe without seeing.That ability to believe without seeing most certainly guides this film. Writer-director Linklater couldnt have known where 12 years of shooting this story would lead following a boy and his family -- and the actors who play them -- across time. But we are blessed that he did because it has resulted in an extraordinarily intimate portrait of a life unfolding and an exceptional unconventional film in which not much else occurs. Never has so little meant more. Though the list of players expands and contracts through the years the central family unit consists of Ellar Coltrane as the boy Mason Jr.; Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter as older sister Samantha; Patricia Arquette as single-mom Olivia; and Ethan Hawke as Mason Sr. the father who is finding his way back into his kids lives as the film begins.Oscars 2015 Full coverage The process was an unusual one to say the least. Starting in 2002 each year Linklater would begin the conversation with the cast starting with Coltrane talking about life and change. Then the filmmaker would write next he would gather his cast for a few days of shooting. Finally Linklater and his longtime editor Sandra Adair would edit the footage and store it away. Year after year the movie moved forward taking shape growing up alongside Mason. It can sound like a gimmick but its anything but; Linklaters leap of faith has given us an experience as much as a film.

Boyhood director Richard Linklater talks about the challenges of casting a film that would be shot over 12 years. See more videos There is wonder to be found in the very ordinariness of ""Boyhood"" from the clouds 6-year-old Mason watches in the opening scene to the rock ridge where as a new college freshman he is perched and pondering life in the films final moments. It is a credit to Linklaters facility with long-form storytelling that even after nearly three hours I didnt want the movie to end.Though it has mythical qualities ""Boyhood"" is framed by specific realities and perpetual ambiguity. Olivias first major decision -- to move the family to Houston -- is rooted in the stack of bills in front of her the dead-end job. Houston is the promised land where her mother can help with the kids she can go back to school make a better life. Dreams propel her forward into a future she cant foresee.

Patricia Arquette talks about shooting ""Boyhood"" for 12 year as Tilda Swinton Laura Dern and Emma Stone join in during a ""Hollywood Sessions"" panel. See more videos For the kids its a constant uprooting. They feel the change differently though the framing is the same -- leaving everything they know for everything they dont its harder for them to see the promise. That motif of movement is one of ""Boyhoods"" constants. Stepparents blended families girlfriends teachers divorces interests ideas disruptions flow through the years and provide the narrative structure. The time transitions are remarkably seamless -- Mason walks down a hallway at one age turns a corner and is a few years older. It works especially since all the details shift as fluidly the difference embedded in the clothes hair video games music and of course the faces.Mason and Samantha Coltrane and young Linklater literally grow up in front of us. But in their own way the changes in Olivia and Mason Sr. Arquette and Hawke are just as marked.Though the themes are serious the film is filled with a lightness. Mason sprawled on his bed rolling his eyes as a 9-year-old Samantha makes him a captive audience to her singing and dancing says everything about the way siblings rely on relate to and test each other.A few scenes later after Dad has blown back into town his reconnecting with the kids spills into a bowling alley. After a few gutter balls Mason wants bumpers so he can get a strike like his sister. Dad resists a laid-back admonition to his son essentially to forget the bumpers toughen up take the knocks. Inside that moment is a father pushing his son toward adulthood but it is also a man taking that first step into actual parenting. Mason Sr. will get better in time growth comes to everyone in the film.Because Linklater has wrapped the family around time and time around that family ""Boyhood"" allows you to see the dynamics from all sides. The way childhood innocence shifts into an increasingly informed state. That fusion of unconditional love and insistent worries about inadequacy that is parenthood.There is a great balance between humor and pathos in each of the performances. Arquette and Hawke are masterful in following the arc of adults maturing in the wake of their mistakes. The actors whove done so much fine work in their careers bring a humanity resilience and vulnerability to the roles that weve not seen quite as fully realized before. And Lorelei Linklater makes Samanthas transition from delightful youngster to petulant teen absolutely believable.But Coltrane is the films emotional glue. He is remarkable on-screen at every stage. Early on hes a young boy of few words but even at 6 enough of a performer that he absorbs everything in ways that allow you to sense and see. As Mason grows the dialogue and the emotions become more complex and Coltranes performance follows in kind.The moody teen who turns to photography to express his artistic inclinations caught in an insolent glance at a disapproving teacher. The growing sense of care and understanding he quietly extends to his mother. The esoteric notions about existence emerging along with serious feelings for the girl he is sharing them with. All this Coltrane makes real. And out of the Coltrane-Mason connection an actor emerges.For all of its uniqueness ""Boyhood"" is exactly the kind of film we should have expected Linklater to do. Over the span of his career the filmmaker has proved to be as much a cultural anthropologist as writer-director ever curious about how things will work out. His collaboration with Julie Delpy and Hawke in the brilliant ""Before"" trilogy -- ""Sunrise"" ""Sunset"" and ""Midnight"" marking out a couples various emotional states -- extended over nearly two decades the director and his stars creating an intimate expression of love and relationships.There is also a veracity that infuses all of the directors work. If God is in the details then Linklater is contemporary cinemas god. From the people that populate his films to the places they unfold he threads that needle perfectly. In ""Boyhood"" it lives in everyone Mason encounters the professor/stepfather (Marco Perella) descending into alcoholism and abuse. The remarkably gentle torch-passing in Grandpa Cliffs (Richard Jones) graduation gift to Mason -- a rifle and a lesson on how to shoot. Every scene can be deconstructed in that way broken apart into many small truths. Along with the cast and the creator is ""Boyhoods"" equally adept crew. Cinematographers Lee Daniel and Shane Kelly work as seamlessly as the film. Production designer Rodney Becker and costume designer Kari Perkins ensure Linklater gets the period changes right. Music supervisors Randall Poster and Meghan Currier are behind a soundtrack that sings of the passing of time from Coldplay to Arcade Fire.I cannot remember when a film has moved me more or captured so well all the colors and shadings of the personal yet universal process of becoming. It is tempting to pile on a thousand more superlatives. But I wont. Because the best way to experience the film is to do exactly that experience it.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 822 p.m. EDT July 10 2014The main character in ""Boyhood"" Mason was played by Ellar Coltrane starting at age 6.(Photo IFC Films)Like many groundbreaking works of art Boyhood is deceptively simple. ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities)One of the most extraordinary films in decades this family drama is also one of the most ambitious in scope having taken more than a decade to shoot. Yet it comes across as effortless and unassuming. Boyhood is an epic masterpiece that seems wholly unconcerned with trying to be one.Shot in sequence over the course of 12 years -- filming 3-4 days each year -- director Richard Linklater chronicles the life of a Texas boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) in the formative years from age 7 through 19. His maturation is complicated often funny sometimes painful but always credible.Linklater is the ideal filmmaker to pull off such an immense and intimate project given his well-observed and witty Before Sunrise/ Before Sunset/ Before Midnight trilogy.STORY Boyhood faces all the ups and downs of growing upMORE Boyhood made with trust hope and film magicREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesHere Linklater employs the same actors to play estranged parents Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) and Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and their children Mason (Coltrane) and Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter). Over the course of 164 minutes audiences watch as two children grow into young adults. The result is a profoundly moving clear-eyed and glorious meditation on the human condition.The films accomplishments are richly varied. The audience feels privy to the details of a familial story over an extended period as if watching a family photo album come to life. Linklater infuses his film with empathy humor and soulfulness. We emerge almost shaken with a breathtaking sense that we have witnessed something authentic uplifting and profound.Its exceedingly rare in a movie to see children (or their parents) physically mentally and emotionally change in such a visceral way.This kind of evolution is more the province of television. But even in TV change is incremental as it occurs over the course of several seasons in a series not all in one sitting.Evoking a sprawling sense of real life and the passage of time Boyhood is masterful storytelling that feels astonishingly seamless.The films consistency of tone focus and continuity dazzle. With a year elapsing between shoots it would be understandable if the story occasionally felt disjointed. But it never does. We not only believe these four people are a family we become immersed in their individual sagas.The four actors emotional investment is palpable. Coltrane and young Linklater are hugely appealing with very specific identities established early. The performances of all four lead actors are understated and outstanding but Coltrane especially is a revelation.Over time Masons emotional intelligence evolves and the audience gets a vivid sense of the man hell become. By the films conclusion we feel as if Mason can safely go off to an independent life without our watchfulness.The story is told from his perspective. It captures the behavior of parents as seen through the often-mystified eyes of a child and beautifully conveys youthful resilience.Mason is artistic wry and philosophical. A bit of a dreamer hes usually kind with a slow smile that must be earned. He has an almost uncanny internal alarm for critical moments in his parents lives.The overall arc of his youth is recognizable to anyone who remembers being a child or has raised one. Nothing is particularly extraordinary or earth-shaking in Masons life and yet its all enthralling.Easily the best movie of the summer Boyhood is much more than a coming-of-age tale. As mesmerizing as a great novel it brilliantly captures the ineffable bittersweet process of growing up as seen through the prism of a childs lens.. 222 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1mkeLKj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/10/boyhood-movie-review/10636501/,200,boyhood34,boyhood,usatoday

Watch a clip from the film ""Boyhood"" starring Ellar Coltrane Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. (Photo/Video IFC Films) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 10 2014 154 p.m. ET 2 COMMENTS On rare occasions a movie seems to channel the flow of real life. ""Boyhood"" is one of those occasions. In its ambition which is matched by its execution Richard Linklaters endearing epic is not only rare but unique. A boy--and his family--grow and change over the course of a dozen years in ways weve never seen because the film was made over the course of a dozen years with the same actors. No lookalikes plugged into the central role just one kid caught time and again in the mysterious act of becoming a young man. The passage of time is almost palpable and the growth spurts are as every parent knows unfathomable. Drama always depends on character development. This one develops its hero Mason (Ellar Coltrane) with a documentarians steadfastness and an artists devotion. When the film begins Mason is a wide-eyed and dreamy first-grader. When it ends hes a strikingly self-possessed--and slightly dreamy--high-school graduate. The whole spectacle is heart-swelling. More Reviews Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Land Ho ""Boyhood"" which is set in Mr. Linklaters native Texas has a counterpart in the documentary realm Michael Apteds ""Up"" series a fascinating enterprise spanning almost half a century that has been checking in on its British-born subjects every seven years since they were 7-year-olds in the 1960s. And the most recent of Mr. Linklaters own ""Before"" films--""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Midnight""--have revisited the lives of their fictional hero and heroine played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy at intervals of a decade since they first met in ""Before Sunrise"" on a train bound for Vienna in the mid-1990s. Related Reading Boyhood A Movie Grows Up With Its Actors A Time Warp for Cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood Boyhood Premieres at MoMA Still no filmmaker until now has embarked on a venture quite like this one a production that would have set a brisk pace--only 39 shooting days--if those days hadnt been spread across more than a decade. Fortunately Mr. Linklater was joined in his commitment by Mr. Hawke who plays the boys wayward father Mason Sr. and by Patricia Arquette who plays his divorced and struggling mother Olivia. (Neither actor required a contract; both are superb.) Remarkably the boy cast for the title role--the home-schooled son of Austin artists--turned out to be an inspired choice though in saying that I cant imagine the smart and soulful Mason being played by anyone else. Mr. Linklaters daughter Lorelei is Masons older sister Samantha; shes terrific too even though Sam of necessity in a film called ""Boyhood"" gets less attention than her kid brother. The narrative structure is straightforward or at least straight-line but with a crucial difference thats illustrated by a moment when Masons dad skips a stone across the surface of a stream. Some of the storys skips from one year to the next are imperceptible until you realize that the boy has suddenly changed into someone else a plausibly new version of who he was only a moment ago. Its the sort of realization that takes a parents breath away and each time it happens in the film you may find yourself breathless too. Similar skips--and growth spurts--mark the lives of Masons parents. Suddenly you see that his mom has moved herself and her children beyond a dangerous situation or that his dad may be moving himself beyond his fantasies of making it as a musician. Flux is their lot yet fidelity to their kids is unflagging. A rich subtext is the nature of the gifts the parents give. Olivia is there for Mason and Sam notwithstanding her misadventures with men. Mason Sr. isnt there very often but when he does show up in his black GTO hes a wonderfully warm and funny source of fellowship even wisdom along with some nonsense. ""Were all just winging it"" he tells his son who in adolescent dejection has asked about the point of it all. ""The good news is youre feeling stuff you know? And youve got to hold on to that. You get older and you dont feel as much your skin gets tough."" This quietly gorgeous film--shot on 35 mm film by Lee Daniel and Shane Kelly--lets us feel stuff that many features try to reach but few celebrate so stirringly the sweetness and pain of family life the joy of the now the evolving wonder of personhood. When Mason is still a tender kid verging perilously on puberty he asks his dad an urgent question ""Theres no like real magic in the world right?"" Youll have to see the movie for his fathers answer but I can tell you that ""Boyhood"" is as real as magic gets. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE Boy (2010) Instead of boyhoods full sweep the New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi gives us Boy an 11-year-old played engagingly by James Rolleston. The time is 1984. The setting is a poor Maori community on tribal lands in the unspoiled East Cape region of New Zealands North Island. Its the town where Mr. Waititi grew up and he plays Boys father a goony stoner shameless prevaricator and scuzzy crook who has come home after years of absence to dig up a bag of money that hed buried in a nearby field.

Director Richard Linklater (244). R Language. Lincoln Plaza IFC BAM Rose Cinemas. Richard Linklaters terrific ""Boyhood"" is a transporting experience about the simplest of subjects. The movie telescopes artfully -- but never pretentiously -- the process of growing up. Filmed for a few weeks every year from 2002 to 2013 the film is like nothing youve ever seen. The closest mainstream equivalent is watching the cast grow up in the ""Harry Potter"" films.(Earlier Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel films followed one actor and character over 20 years.) But the magic here is real life and how it happens while youre busy doing other things. They say that when raising a child the days are long but the years go fast. When this film opens 6-year-old Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) live in Texas with their mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette). Olivia whos divorced is moving the kids to Houston so their grandmother can help out. Then its a year later -- we never see dates onscreen but haircuts change and we hear of news events. The childrens dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) shows up with gifts and a shaggy but affectionate energy. Hes moved back from Alaska and wants to be a presence in their lives. The next year Olivia goes back to school to get a bachelors degree. She soon marries her professor Bill (Marco Perella) a jerky drunk. A few years on Olivia leaves Bill as she and her kids move to San Marcos Tex. near Austin. New schools and new friends become an issue again. As a preteen Mason sees his dad go from hopeful musician to insurance salesman with a new wife. Olivia marries and divorces yet another husband. In high school Mason becomes interested in photography while dating -- and breaking up with -- his first girlfriend. When he moves into his dorm at UT-Austin we feel like we know this thoughtful young man. Ethan Hawke (center) Lorelei Linklater and Ellar Coltrane filming Boyhood (IFC Films) Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane in Boyhood (ifc films) Ellar Coltrane in Boyhood (ifc films) And not just him though. Lorelei Linklater is droll and funny whether shes being a sassy sis or a cool collegian. As they go from their 30s to mid-40s Hawke (in his 12th collaboration with Linklater) and Arquette allow themselves to age on camera providing an honesty few performers would achieve. Coltranes progression is part of the films poetry. Linklater couldnt know when filming began if his leading man would become a good actor. Indeed when Mason is 12 and 13 Coltrane is fittingly awkward. Its tough to accept that this surly youth was once that guileless grade-schooler; we worry how hell turn out. Yet as Mason (and Coltrane) starts his second half of high school he develops a quirky wry likability. This bold movie may sound like a stunt but its so much more than that. Linklater is an effortless genial auteur and his passions are woven through ""Dazed and Confused"" ""School of Rock"" and the ""Before Sunrise"" trilogy. Here his mellow groove becomes an everyday rhythm. Toward the end of the film Mason wonders aloud about transformative experiences. One of the beauties of ""Boyhood"" is that we know hes in one.

The biggest shock though not unexpected is when the leading mans voice changes. Leading boy really. Weve been watching Mason (Ellar Coltrane) since he was an adorable six and the onslaught of puberty strikes us as forcefully as it does him. Our little boy is becoming a young man. Linklaters gimmick -- actually his genius -- was to visit the same core cast of fictional characters played by the same actors for a few days each year. Rounding up Lorelei Linklater (his own daughter) as Masons elder sister Samantha Patricia Arquette as their mom Olivia and Ethan Hawke their dad Mason Sr. the writer-director began in the summer of 2002 when its star actor was turning six and concluded last autumn when Mason is shown going off to college. Linklater eventually distilled these dozen years into a 160-minute movie that spends 10 or 15 minutes on each year. You might wonder if he made a 12-hour directors cut for DVD release; he didnt. But the seasons pass so fluidly with Mason and Samantha maturing before our eyes as if through gentle time-lapse photography that the movie could be much longer to afford the audience the pleasure of spending more time with people worth caring for. (READ Katy Steinmetz reports on the making of Boyhood) Thats the seductive magic of Boyhood. Watching it gives viewers a protective possessive feeling about Mason. We have the intense rooting interest of surrogate parents or doting aunts and uncles on an annual family reunion. We hope that Mason will survive his mothers broken marriage and later involvement with other men. We want him to grow out of that bad haircut overcome his siege of acne emerge intact from the heartbreak of first love. A home movie of a fictional home life an epic assembled from vignettes Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie. Films marking the development over the years of a single young character usually employ different actors at different ages as Maleficent does for the child and teen gestations of Angelina Jolie. Among the very few notable exceptions is Francois Truffauts 1959 The 400 Blows which focused on the restless 14-year-old Antoine Doinel and grew into a five-film series spanning 20 years all starring Jean-Pierre Leaud; its available in the Criterion DVD set The Adventures of Antoine Doinel. One unique documentary project Michael Apteds Up series has traced the separate lives of about a dozen English people every seven years from school kids in 1964 (Seven Up) to late middle age in the most recent installment (56 Up). (READ Corliss on Michael Apteds Up documentaries) In fiction films though directors cant wait years for their young actors to grow up; most pictures need to be finished yesterday. Who would gamble on a first-graders star quality his sheer screen watchability that can be sustained and enriched until hes a college freshman? Linklater -- who also hatched the same-time-next-decade romantic trilogy with Hawke and Julie Delpy that was capped last summer by Before Midnight -- took that risk with the young Coltrane. And no he didnt sign the six-year-old to a 12-year movie contract; reenlistment was voluntary. ""My hope"" the filmmaker told The New York Times ""was that his parents and him would see this as a positive thing in his life and a fun thing to be involved in every year."" (READ Mary Pols review of Richard Linklaters Before Midnight) A beautiful child who goes on to endure a naturally gawky phase and grows up to resemble a slimmer much taller Peter Dinklage Coltrane has the gift of visible introspection; the subtle play of his face provides a window into Masons mind. As his sister Lorelei Linklater is a natural showboater with preternatural poise; her closest pop-culture sibling would be Mad Mens Sally Draper (always played by Kiernan Shipka) who in the shows seven years has sprouted from a lovely six-year old into a willful teenager. Arquette ages as well puts on a few pounds and persuasively inhabits a woman fighting for her own identity and finally locating it as a child psychologist. And Hawke who has appeared in nine of Linklaters 16 fiction features plays fair with Mason Sr. -- a man who creates a new family while trying to keep unbreakable ties with the one he left. Since no title cards establish each new year viewers must infer the period from references to Fallujah (2003) or the publication of the sixth Harry Potter book (2005) or the 2008 Presidential campaign when Olivia recklessly has her kids plant Obama material on neighbors lawns. Gradually you learn to go with the flow and to enjoy the privileged moments as they unfold a bowling date or a camping trip or an Astros game (Roger Clemens manhandles the Brewers) with Dad; a conference with a sympathetic high-school teacher that points Mason toward pursuing his love of photography. The brief scene of Mason in class pledging allegiance to the Texas flag underlines the 53-year-old filmmakers affinity to his home state where he shot his first two features Slacker and Dazed and Confused before following the elaborate itinerary of his later films. (READ Richard Linklater on his Dazed and Confused pal Matthew McConaughey) Olivia is no globetrotter. Though she moves her family from one Texas town to another she feels cramped by having gone directly from being ""somebodys daughter"" to being ""somebody elses f-king mother."" This woman needs a man usually the wrong one. After her break with the kids dad she marries Professor Bill (Marco Perella) whose geniality masks an alcoholic belief that his new wife and stepchildren are his students and his home a classroom that becomes a prison. Hes a horror -- providing the films one potent flourish of domestic melodrama -- but Mason would probably prefer his real dad to any pretender his mom hooks up with. ""Whyd you even marry him?"" the young Mason asks his mom about Professor Bill. Later as a teenager he tells Mason Sr. that he wishes the parents whatever their abrasions had stayed together. ""It wouldve saved us from a parade of drunken assholes."" Masons life has its difficulties but few extremities; it unfolds rather than exploding in reality-TVs manufactured traumas. To sit through Boyhood is to page through a family album of folks you just met yet feel youve known forever. Each picture tells a poignant story. In the first year Samantha tries to entertain or annoy her kid brother with her grinding rendition of ""Oops... I Did It Again."" Before leaving the home he grew up in Mason applies paint to cover the pencil marks measuring the heights of him and his sister. After Professor Bill insists that Mason get a buzz cut the boy is humiliated -- until he reads a note passed from a pretty girl in his class ""I think your new hair looks kewl."" Poor wistful Mason he might be any of the Texas boys raised by a tough dad (Brad Pitt) in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life. (READ The cinematic vision of Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life) At one family gathering were startled by the presence of a mother and daughter we last saw seven or eight years earlier (about an hour in screen time) befriending Olivia at a critical moment. For being there when Olivia when she most needed them and for staying in her life these two women deserve a big hug of gratitude. For his 17th birthday Mason receives plenty of hugs and several presents a 12-gauge shotgun and a red-letter Bible from his moms folks and from Mason Sr. a personally mixed ""Black Album"" of songs by Beatles members after they left the group. Dads mighty proud of that gift but what Mason really hoped for was the battered old GTO his father had offhandedly promised to give him when the kid was old enough to drive. Dad forgot about that. Parents forget; kids remember. Or is it the other way around? We all recall what is or was important to us and are astonished when it slips other peoples minds. Perhaps we dismiss as irrelevant matters of crucial concern to those we love. Thats life as most of us experience it and which few movies document with such understated acuity as Boyhood does. Embrace each moment Linklater tells us because it wont come again -- unless he is there to record it shape it and turn it into an indelible movie. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Shot over a dozen years and running just over two and a half hours long it stretches out in that dimension in a way that no other film has outside of maybe the Up documentary series. In showing 12 years in the life of Mason Jr. an ordinary Texas boy making his way toward young adulthood it also captures how star Ellar Coltrane and the movies other cast members change and age entering teenagerdom or middle age over the course of the film ending it as both the same and very different people from who they were when it began. But Boyhood which opens this Friday in New York and L.A. and in more cities the week after also brings to mind a six-minute YouTube video. A specific one -- ""Everyday"" in which photographer Noah Kalina took a daily snapshot of himself and compiled six years of results into a viral sensation. Set to a moody piano track composed by Kalinas then-girlfriend the video uses the most mundane of materials -- selfies taken against backdrops of cluttered New York rooms -- to summon a sensation thats melancholy and profound. Its a look at how time works on one person and a reminder that its doing the same to us all. ID 3306544 Video available at http//youtube.com/watch?v=6B26asyGKDo. Noah Kalinas ""Everyday."" Noah Kalina ID 3306583 Kalinas continued the project -- in 2012 he released a new longer version that encompasses 12 and a half years which is about the span of Boyhoods production. Its labeled ""A Work in Progress"" a promise of more and a reminder that the point of the video is to document a process that only stops when its creator does. Theres a similar feeling of open-endedness to Boyhood which begins with Mason as a 6-year-old and ends when hes heading to college a lanky teenager giving off glimpses of the man hell eventually be. Boyhood doesnt really follow an arc though it catches the ups and downs that would describe anyones life. In its opening shot it pulls out to reveal its protagonist lying on the grass on an unexceptional but beautiful day and when it comes to a close its not after something major has happened to Mason or because hes reached a particular moment of understanding. It ends because leaving home is as good a time as any for the film to bow out just as its subject is beginning a next step in his life. ID 3306549 IFC Films IFC Films ID 3316578 In the storytelling sense nothing major happens to Mason -- Boyhood deliberately skirts most of the typical milestones of a coming-of-age story Theres no first kiss no epiphany about what hes going to do with his life no air-clearing showdown with his parents. Its not a collection of best-of moments on the theme of adolescence. In fact the moments in which you can most feel the hand of a director are the films least satisfying -- the ones in which theres suddenly a feeling of a story that needs to be navigated as when Masons first stepfather turns out to be an alcoholic and a real prick or when a bit of advice one character gives pays off later on. But those are small quibbles about a movie that otherwise manages to inhabit the moment with zen-like consistency and the zoomed-in specificity of Masons experiences only make the end result more universal. Mason plays Dead Man Come Alive on a trampoline and deals with a family move to Houston he bickers with his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) in the backseat of a car and attends a midnight Harry Potter book release party. Hes shorn of his long hair by a disapproving stepparent and receives questionable advice about girls from some older kids while going from pensive round-faced child to angular artistic teen. ID 3316113 IFC Films IFC Films ID 3316552 Divorced before the movie even begins Masons parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) do their own share of maturing demonstrating in different ways that you dont stop growing up just because you have a child. Arquettes Olivia carves out a satisfying political path for herself but cant seem to stop making the same repeated mistakes in her personal life. And Linklater clearly has a connection to Mason Sr. the well-meaning but initially immature dad who really needed another decade of bouncing around before attempting parenthood. Mason Sr. can be unreliable but hes also loving and charming and like most of the characters in the film cant be pinned down. ""I will not be that guy -- you cannot put me in that category"" he tells his kids on a weekend visit when they try to fend him off with small talk insisting they share with him real details about their lives instead of polite conversations. He wants to be the cool dad to cut through the bullshit shell of social interactions to get to whats actually important. But Boyhood is a testament to how momentous those seemingly unimportant times are the instances that get cut out of anecdotes but that are just as essential a part of ones personal history. Its a collage of ordinary fragments that in the end add up to a greater whole.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres never been a movie quite like Boyhood and it may be years before anyone works up the gumption to match its achievement. The process in which this sprawling coming-of-age story was created is uniquely ambitious Richard Linklater the Texas slacker-poet who made Dazed And Confused shot the film over a dozen years reconvening with his cast and crew for a few days annually. As a result two of the stars--Ellar Coltrane as the boy of the title Linklaters daughter Lorelei as his sister--literally grow up on-screen changing over the course of the movies lengthy running time from grade-school-age performers to college-age ones. Seeing them mature in fast motion physical hallmarks of childhood melting away every few minutes is a truly remarkable experience.There is to be fair some precedent for what Boyhood attempts. In a sense the film is a spiritual cousin to Linklaters Before movies which similarly chart the physical (and emotional) changes its actors undergo across a vast expanse of time. Also worth noting are Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel movies the ongoing Up series and the Harry Potter franchise; furthermore anyone whos been watching Mad Men The Walking Dead and Game Of Thrones since their respective pilots has borne witness to some rather dramatic growth spurts. Boyhood though is grander and more adventurous than all of those works because it crams an entire real adolescence into one three-hour narrative. Sometimes the age shift is so sudden that its comical One cut for example finds Coltrane instantaneously transforming from a prepubescent child to a lanky deep-voiced teenager.Using pop music technology and changes in its casts appearance to denote each temporal leap forward Boyhood tells the years-spanning saga of Mason (Coltrane) a sensitive and laid-back American kid who lives with his mother (Patricia Arquette) and sister (Lorelei Linklater) in suburban Texas. Masons father played by Linklater muse Ethan Hawke is an inconsistent presence floating in for weekend visits but disappearing from his offsprings lives for months at a time. The film charges forward through the years as the family changes cities hard-drinking stepfathers come and go and both children inch slowly but inexorably into adult life.Some of Boyhood is eventful as when Masons mother is forced to abruptly yank her children out of a bad living situation. (Though somewhat clumsily executed these scenes accurately convey the difficulty of living under the rule of an abusive drunk.) Mostly however the movie is composed of non-events devoting entire passages to the ordinary stuff of modern life a camping trip a high-school party the discovery of a dead bird in the backyard. What Linklater is after here is a mundanely meaningful vision of growing up a childhood told in fragments and minutiae. The seminal moments in our lives the ones that shape who well become arent always the expected ones. Notably the film skips past Masons first kiss his first beer and the loss of his virginity. Its less interested in typical milestones of youth than in the deceptively forgettable stuff that happens before and after them. Because of how it was filmed in piecemeal from 2002 until 2013 Boyhood exists in a constant present tense providing a snapshot of recent history as it unfolds. Conversations about Obama and Bush were written and delivered without the hindsight the audience now possesses as was an unexpectedly funny moment of Mason and his father discussing the possibility of more Star Wars sequels. (Ah the innocence of 2008.) The movie also functions as a chronicle of its creators artistic evolution The filmmaking becomes more confident and relaxed as Mason gets older Linklater increasingly letting go of his plot aspirations in favor of a loose conversational hang-out vibe. He too seems to blossom before our eyes gestating incrementally into the director he is today.As drama Boyhood can be a little patchy. Some shapelessness was always going to be a consequence of the filming method possibly an intentional one; life after all fits no easy arcs or structures. And some of the movies passages are more compelling than others with Linklater using the aimless nature of the narrative as an excuse to indulge in some of his signature Lefty sloganeering and stoner philosophizing. (The writing talents of Hawke and Julie Delpy who co-authored the last two Before films are sometimes missed here.) But Boyhood doesnt lack for a thematic framework nor for rich insight into what its like to be young and powerless every move dictated by adults who dont necessarily know best. Stifling authority figures orbit Mason throughout; his journey it becomes clear is not just a rite of passage--its a dawning realization that if hes not careful adult life will become just a different set of rules and restrictions. Despite its title Boyhood is also about what it means to be a parent to square ones own life against that of a son or daughter. Theres great poignancy in seeing Hawke and Arquette age too in parallel to their young co-stars. The latter delivers a moving late-film monologue an explosion of feeling from a character whos been relegated to a supporting role in the way most children eventually relegate their own folks to the sidelines. Mason can hardly wait to escape into the long sprawl of post-teenage existence. What he doesnt understand but his mother does is that time will eventually fly faster than hell desire. In condensing a quarter of a life into three languid hours Linklater comes close to capturing how most people remember their childhoods as a series of random occurrences some big and some small all given meaning by their proximity to each other. Theres a cumulative power here that transcends any rough patches. Boyhood isnt perfect but its an astonishing one-of-a-kind accomplishment--and further proof that Linklater is one of the most daring ambitious filmmakers working today.

"Boyhood starring Ethan Hawke Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane and directed by Richard Linklater reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Richard Linklaters Boyhood As Transcendent as It Is Ordinary--Just Like Life Richard Linklaters Boyhood As Transcendent as It Is Ordinary--Just Like Life Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 9 2014 857 PM Boyhood As transcendent as it is ordinary--just like life. By Dana Stevens A scene from Richard Linklaters Boyhood Courtesy of IFC Films Among the arts cinema has a unique relationship with time. Like photography film captures a moment in permanent reproducible form; but like music and dance it also moves through time itself requiring the listener or viewer to invest some portion of her allotted hours on Earth in accompanying its unspooling. Film cant help but show time passing; that might be thought of as its most irreducible function whether the object in frame is the Empire State Building in Andy Warhols Empire or Alida Valli striding coldly up the boulevard past Joseph Cotten at the end of The Third Man. Something (or in Warhols case nothing) happened; a camera was there to record it; and though you can rewatch that past moment as often as you like it will never take place again. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power and the melancholy of films intimate enmeshment with time in the way Richard Linklaters Boyhood does. Theres Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel series in which we watch that character a truant kid played by Truffauts onscreen proxy and eventual quasi-adopted son Jean-Pierre Leaud age from around 12 to around 32. But since those five films were made over a period of 20 years the shock of watching Leaud grow up comes at us serially in chunks. Michael Apteds extraordinary Up documentaries which check in every seven years on the progress of the lives of a group of British schoolchildren first filmed in 1964 are even more widely spaced; visiting each new installment is like attending a family reunion wondering who will show up and what condition he or she will be in. But Boyhood which traces the life of Mason a fictional Texas boy (Ellar Coltrane) from age 7 to age 18 does something with film and time that neither Truffaut nor Apted did--something thats at once conceptually simple and logistically half insane. Filming once a year over a course of 12 years Linklater built a story around the real-life passage through time not only of Coltrane but of the entire cast (including his own daughter Lorelei Linklater who plays Masons bossy older sister Samantha). Condensing a dozen years of growth and change into a two-hour-and-40-minute-long narrative Boyhood reimagines the coming-of-age film as family album longitudinal character study and collaborative artistic experiment--a mad risk that paid off in a movie thats as transcendent as it is ordinary just like life. Boyhood reimagines the coming-of-age film as family album longitudinal character study and collaborative artistic experiment. Advertisement Nothing that happens in Boyhood breaks new ground in the history of drama--if anything Linklater is at pains to keep surprising incidents to a minimum. (When his daughter then a teenager tired of returning to her dads pet project every summer asked him to kill off her character the director refused He wanted to avoid any such tragic twists.) Mason and Samanthas stressed-out single mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) squabbles with their father and her ex the charming but flakey Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke). After moving the children to Houston so she can study for a psychology degree Olivia marries her professor (Marco Perella) which proves for reasons Ill let the film unfold for you to be a huge mistake. Fleeing that nightmare she heads to San Marcos Texas where she takes up with a younger man an Iraq vet who may or may not also be iffy husband material. All the while Mason Sr. retains regular contact with his kids gradually maturing into a more present if less glamorous dad--by the time Mason and Samantha reach high school hes the happily remarried minivan-driving father of a baby boy. Though Masons parents struggles and loves provide a scaffolding to hang the story on the real stuff of Boyhood consists in the consecutive isolated moments of childhood we experience through Masons eyes--listening to his parents fight downstairs getting a note from a crushed-out classmate for the first time being dragged to get a crewcut against his will by his strict new stepfather shouting at his annoying sister to stop singing Britney Spears. (Linklaters use of contemporary pop music as background sound--which kept the final soundtrack on hold for months while music-licensing issues were worked out--is only one of the ways he deliberately but subtly situates Boyhood in its historical time frame. A scene that takes place in the headily idealistic days of Obamas first presidential campaign plays now with a tincture of second-term irony.) Without flashbacks flashforwards explicit time markers (""two years later"" etc.) or other explanatory devices Linklater trusts his audience to hang on for the ride as Mason grows--at first imperceptibly then suddenly with shocking speed--from a round-cheeked imp on a bike into a lanky thoughtful teenager with piercings acne and a fast-food summer job. In order for the gradually unfolding miracle that is Boyhood to come together a lot of collaborators had to be on the same page over the course of a long and much-interrupted period of time. (Linklater has called it the longest scheduled shoot in film history.) There are inevitable rough patches in the end result most of them having to do with inconsistencies in the performance style between the professional and nonprofessional actors. Arquette and Hawke are both superb doing the best work of their careers as they throw themselves into their characters satisfyingly long and inclusive arcs. Over the course of the dozen years the film covers they get the chance to crack jokes; read Harry Potter aloud; flirt; offer advice; lash out; break down; and in Arquettes case deliver a late monologue about the heartbreak of becoming an empty-nester thats at once devastating and humorously over the top ""You know whats next? My funeral"" Like Hawke and Julie Delpy in Linklaters Before series--another example of the longitudinal cinematic study described above--Arquettes and Hawkes low-key but acutely observed performances seem to effortlessly incorporate decades worth of backstory; they arent so much acting as behaving within a context. And because Linklater lucked out--or is preternaturally gifted at casting child actors--the quiet focused Coltrane matches them beat for acting beat whether hes a middle-schooler asking his dad if elves are real or a 15-year-old admitting to his mom he just smoked pot. But Linklaters daughter Lorelei charmingly uninhibited in the early scenes seems increasingly stiff and uncomfortable in her role. And Marco Perella as Olivias authoritarian and eventually dangerous second husband lays on the menace with a gardening trowel; he seems to be scaling his acting for a different film than the one hes in. But Boyhoods irregular handmade quality and occasional intersections with everyday reality (like the moment when a home run at a real Houston Astros game is incorporated into the story) are a part of the films unique texture its status as both narrative and document. Were all familiar with the convention wherein a vaguely lookalike child actor is cast to play the younger version of a films lead and with that moment of disruption and disconnection when the adult actor appears for the first time and we must accept the characters existential continuity with the kid who came before. In Boyhood theres never a question of Ellar Coltranes continuity with himself yet the changes he undergoes before our eyes require an even bigger leap of faith. Compressed into the space of under three hours growing up seems as inexplicable a feat as a magic trick. ""Its always now"" the college-aged Mason marvels near the end of the film tripping on mushrooms with some friends in West Texas Big Bend National Park. (If Boyhood has a recurring theme beyond the mystery of times passage its Linklaters Proustian memory for the scruffy sunbaked landscapes of his home state.) Masons epiphany about the ever-renewed ""nowness"" of the present moment may be hallucinogen-induced but the audiences own epiphany has been brought on by something else the profound funny beautiful film weve just to our surprise spent nearly three hours (or was it 12 years?) inside of.

Im always skeptical about films that emerge from the thin mountain air of the Sundance Film Festival wreathed in rave reviews -- especially if they have a gimmick -- but Richard Linklaters remarkable ""Boyhood pretty much lives up to the hype at sea level. Linklater ambitiously shot his new effort over a period of 12 years with the same cast showcasing what turns out to be an astonishing performance by newcomer Ellar Coltrane who grows up from 6 to 18 before our eyes over the course of 164 minutes. Ethan Hawke (center) stars alongside Lorelei Linklater (left) and Ellar Coltrane (right) in ""Boyhood.""Photo Matt Lankes/IFC Films He plays a young man named Mason whose bittersweet passage toward adulthood is filled with potholes. As the journey begins back in 2002 his struggling single mom Olivia (a terrific Patricia Arquette) decides to uproot Mason and his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) from their home and school to Houston. Its the first of several moves as Olivia pursues a career in teaching and romantic choices that turn into disasters (a college-professor second husband who turns out to be an alcoholic martinet) or quietly implode (a seemingly sympathetic Army veteran who in the end cant cope with Masons rebelliousness). Mason can also seem lazy unfocused confused and selfish -- like many an adolescent -- but underneath it all he has a good heart and talent as a photographer. One constant in Masons life is his father Mason Sr. played by Ethan Hawke -- an unsuccessful musician who at first seems like a variation on the self-centered jerk that Hawke played in Linklaters overpraised ""Before trilogy (1996-2013). Ellar Coltrane as Mason age 6.Photo Matt Lankes/IFC Films But as the years roll on and Mason Sr. gets a job remarries and starts a second family we see hes very serious about the time he spends with his son and Samantha -- working hard to give them experiences and emotional support they cant always get from their often hard-pressed and sometimes flaky mom. Hawke gives one of his best performances here and Lorelei Linklater is such a live wire she tends to overshadow Coltrane in the very early moments. But Coltrane grows remarkably as an actor and a screen presence over the course of the decade. ""Boyhood is highly episodic and probably could have benefitted from (and found a larger audience with) some tightening. Thats a niggling complaint for a such a heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the United States over the past 12 years -- and one that makes you care such much about the struggles and foibles of its imperfect characters. Its one of the years best.

No other movie I can think of captures the wistfulness of those days full of waiting than Richard Linklaters Boyhood an ambitious and clever undertaking that could easily have turned into a filmmaking disaster. Instead Linklater ends up with a quiet stunner of a movie that yields to time rather than try to bend it to its will. Boyhood had the curious effect of making me feel lost uneasy a little alone in the inexorable march forward -- and also totally emphatically alive. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - See also Our interview with Richard Linklater about BoyhoodLinklater began filming Boyhood in the summer of 2002 planning to follow one character from age 6 to 18 As Mason a small-town Texas kid being raised by a single mom Linklater cast an unknown 7-year-old named Ellar Coltrane a thoughtful-looking lad with hair that keeps skewing in the direction of a punky Dennis the Menace cowlick. Linklater assembled his cast and crew for a few weeks every year -- you could call it a 12-year shoot -- tracing Masons story through childhood and adolescence culminating in his first day at college. He had no idea what kind of a kid or man Coltrane would turn out to be a gawky preteen or one of those rare confident princely ones? At what point would Coltranes voice change? How tall would he get?Film DetailsCritics Pick Boyhood RatingR GenreDrama Running Time160 More Info Trailer Over the course of Boyhoods nearly three hours Mason grows up before our eyes in what can feel something like real time. One minute hes giggling with a friend over the brassiere pages of a mail-order catalogue. (Notably its from Spiegel or JCPenney not Victorias Secret a reminder of the time when boys felt exceedingly fortunate to see live models in those workaday white Cross Your Heart numbers.) The next hes tangled in conversation with the high school girlfriend (Zoe Graham) whos just broken up with him trying to understand exactly what he did wrong unable to see that he did nothing wrong. Hes getting his first taste and surely not his last of the careless barbarism of love. Masons confused suffering has a you-are-there immediacy. In moments like these he doesnt seem like a fictional character; he feels like a refracted version of us.The people around Mason change too His mother (Patricia Arquette) becomes slightly thicker around the middle though her snaggletooth vaguely careworn smile simultaneously becomes more radiant. His sometime-absentee father (Ethan Hawke) doesnt change much physically though bits of his boyishly optimistic aura fall away through the years. His older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) starts out as a bossy mite -- an enthusiastic Britney Spears impersonator -- and grows into a self-possessed young woman wending her way toward the end of college and the beginning of real adulthood. As kids Mason and Samantha observe the behavior of their separated parents like junior scientists of humanity At one point their dad drops them off after an outing (they go bowling and eat forbidden food) and they watch from an upstairs window as their parents argue outside. ""Think hell spend the night?"" Mason asks hopefully. They barely know what ""spending the night"" means but they know enough to see it as a way of securing the life they want or recementing the life they had before their parents split up. Its a kids-eye-view of marriage so sharp it cuts through you.Linklater recently told The New York Times that as he was making the film ""People would ask So what happens? "" Hed have to answer ""Not much."" Thats true and its not. Working with two cinematographers Lee Daniel and Shane F. Kelly and editor Sandra Adair Linklater connects the experiences of Masons childhood adolescence and young adulthood so seamlessly that we barely notice the joins. We see Mason and a bunch of other kids eagerly queuing up in costume for a new Harry Potter book the kind of generation-specific cultural event that the senior citizens of 2072 will remember with great fondness. Later his mom remarries a bullying drunk (the first of two) who forces Mason to get a military-style buzz cut the sort of thing thats adorable on kids younger than 6 but just looks wrong on a rapidly sprouting 9-year-old. Before we know it -- and before his parents know it because thats just how it goes -- Mason has become a lanky serious kid with an artistic bent and an ear gauge. Hes given to philosophical ramblings about not wanting to be a slave to a computer or cellphone screen.By this point the still-boyish (and rather tall) Coltrane has settled so deeply into the role of Mason that it hardly seems like a role at all. Youre likely to forget youre watching an actor which is the whole point. Coltranes Mason is a quiet and observant young man and because weve been watching him all this time we know how he got there. In one of the movies simplest and most affecting moments Linklaters camera takes the measure of a dead bird splayed on the ground. Were seeing it through the very young Masons eyes and even if his curiosity is partly a snakes-and-snails-and -- puppy dogs tails sort of thing it also suggests an awareness that nothing lasts forever -- not even childhood which seems to stretch on forever when youre in the middle of it.Linklater once something of a wunderkind and now a respected filmmaker at midcareer has made so many different types of movies (and so many good ones) that hes hard to pin down. At his best -- as with for example the trio of pictures that began with the rapturous Before Sunrise -- hes a transcendent poet of everyday stuff. With Boyhood which will stand among his finest work hes given us a cinema verite illusion of the endless days and nights of growing up like a time-lapse movie of a flower opening up. It just so happens that this flower is a man.

""They endured"" is the famous post-script to William Faulkners ""The Sound and the Fury"" and thats precisely what Linklaters characters do after a dozen or so tumultuous years. What makes the storytelling of ""Boyhood"" unique is that Linklater made the movie in 40 days stretched out over 12 years so that we see the characters age before us. See video Ethan Hawke Watches Son Grow Up in First Trailer for Richard Linklaters Boyhood (Video) It might sound gimmicky like Alfred Hitchcocks extended takes in ""Rope"" but theres more at play here that just watching hit songs and technology change bit by bit with each passing year. (Linklater a studied connoisseur of pop culture interweaves those milestones with the facility of Armistead Maupin in the ""Tales of the City"" novels.) When we meet young Mason (Ellar Coltrane) hes a bright-eyed six year old who collects arrowheads and snake vertebrae squabbles with his bratty older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) and loves his devoted mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and his oft-absent dad Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke). As the years pass Mason will discover a talent for photography find good mentors (his father a schoolteacher his boss at a fish joint) and bad ones (Olivia picks two seemingly upright husbands who turn out to be alcoholics) learn about the opposite sex (from the lingerie section of the Sears catalog via the internet and by actually talking to them) and before our eyes evolve from boyhood to manhood. Hes not the only one Samantha starts the movie singing a Britney Spears song and ends it as an eye-rolling undergrad Olivia blossoms from student and single mom to professor and even Mason Sr. must trade in his beloved bad-ass GTO for a far more functional mini-van. By the time young Mason is off to college and Olivia finds herself feeling sentimental about his impending departure we feel those same pangs about ""Boyhood"" coming to an end and about watching this child weve seen mature going out on his own into the world. Weve seen people age onscreen before but usually in documentaries like Michael Apteds ""Up"" series or the long-ranging ""Hoop Dreams."" For Linklater to space out the production of a narrative movie over such a long period of time gives the material genuine heft; most films would never dare feature performers clearly going through their awkward years of adolescence -- braces wispy mustaches growth spurts and all -- but Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater make us privy to their every phase up to their emergence as fully-formed young adults. Also read The Real Killer From Bernie Is Free and Will Live in Richard Linklaters Apartment A story with this kind of scope needs room to breathe but even at 160 minutes  ""Boyhood"" never drags. You can feel director Linklater and his frequent editor Sandra Adair rejecting the beats weve come to expect from commercial filmmaking in favor of a more organic flow one that reflects the fits and starts of life itself. (There are recurring conversations throughout the film regarding Pavlov Skinner and the science of human conditioning and the filmmakers are too smart to ring the dinner bell exactly when we think they will.) As he has throughout his career from ""Slacker"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" to the lovely ""Bernie"" to the ""Before"" trilogy Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters. Theres a scene well into the film where Mason Sr.s new in-laws who live in rural Texas give a teenaged Mason Jr. the gift of a Bible and a shotgun and theres nothing snarky or ironic about the moment. Read also Will Ferrell Zach Galifianakis to Star in Larrys Kidney for Richard Linklater The director gives those older characters their sincerity and their kindness and the teenager the understanding and the politeness to accept those gifts even if neither is the sort of thing that fits with the life hes creating for himself. Its a small moment but a telling one -- ""Boyhood"" ultimately understands maturity and adulthood in a way that most man-child comedies never will. Rewatching ""Boyhood"" six months after reviewing it at Sundance I found the experience even richer and deeper. If Linklater and his collaborators have the time and patience to spend the next dozen years making a sequel called ""Manhood"" so much the better. Characters this fascinating deserve to endure.

In a Word Yes. Review Was Richard Linklaters 12 Year Production Worth the Wait? In a Word Yes. Eric Kohn Jul 7 2014 1032 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Twelve years ago Richard Linklater started production on a movie following the development of a child from the age of seven through the end of his teenage years. If there was ever project that demanded to be informed by the history of its making ""Boyhood"" is it. Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout Linklaters incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling -- the closest point of comparison Michael Apteds ""Up"" documentaries dont represent the same singularity of vision. Shot over the course of 39 days spread across more than a decade ""Boyhood"" is an entirely fluid work that puts the process of maturity under the microscope and analyzes its nuances with remarkable detail. The key to ""Boyhood"" lies with the smallness of its story which revolves around the plight of Texan native Mason (Ellar Coltrane) along with his older sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) and their divorced parents Mason Sr. and Olivia (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette). As we watch this quartet consistently age during the movies justifiable 164 minute length the subtle qualities of change become steadily crystallized. At its center Masons growth allows Coltrane to fully inhabit his character through the accumulation of his experiences and their recurring impact on his expanding awareness. As a child he and his sister witness their parents unruly separation from a limited perspective before getting whisked away by their mother to a new life in Houston. That shift marks the first of several transitions that find the broken family unit moving from place to place while their desperate mother veers from one ill-fated relationship to another. In between their free-spirited dad crops up for occasional visits leading to a sharp contrast between the adults meandering lifestyles and their kids regular attempts to comprehend the fractured world around them. Alternately sweet and melancholic ""Boyhood"" slowly unfurls with an enthralling trajectory relying on the changes in its characters physical appearances to connote the advancing years. Beyond the inherent intrigue of this structural gimmick however ""Boyhood"" maintains a consistent focus. During Olivias second marriage to her graduate psychology professor Bill (Marco Perella) the children observe a far more upsetting breakup than the preceding one with Bill growing dangerously moody under the influence of alcoholism. While this chapter constitutes the narratives darkest hour it also plants a seed of understanding that enables an increasingly self-reliant Mason to resist similar oppression from his mothers third and equally reckless husband. ""Boyhood"" owes much of its power to this network of cause and effect spread across its plot with fascinating nuances. As his voice deepens and he blossoms into a long-haired deep-voiced pot-smoking teen gains a first love and develops a promising interest in professional photography Mason embodies the rite of passage indicated by the title. Watch Boyhood Director Richard Linklater and Star Ellar Coltrane Discuss Their 12-Year Collaboration But ""Boyhood"" leaves ample room for its supporting characters to define the conditions of Masons growth. Lorelei Linklaters assertiveness makes her character an equal source of interest for the way she quietly remains the familys backbone. Hawkes Mason Sr. a freewheeling lefty musician crops up just frequently enough to offer a rich commentary on the advancing challenges faced by his kids. While their relationship never becomes strained its clear by the movies later years that Mason has learned to view his fathers nuggets of wisdom with a healthy dose of skepticism. Hawke who undergoes almost as much of a dramatic physical change as Coltrane provides a nifty counterpoint to the soul-searcher he portrayed in Linklaters ""Before"" trilogy He has muddled passion and politics to spare (in one hilarious sequence presumably shot in 2008 he encourages his kids to nab John McCain flyers off his neighbors lawn; in 2002 he fills their heads with anti-war ideology) but not much to show for it. Among the focused ensemble only Arquette strains from certain unmistakable one-note aspects in the role of the flimsy put-upon woman but eventually gets the chance to show her assertiveness once her children stop being high maintenance. While continually astute ""Boyhood"" gets particularly engrossing during its final third when Mason starts to pursue his professional interests and contemplate his future in light of the possibilities he has witnessed at home. A central conversation with his girlfriend during a visit the duo pay to his sister at her college illustrates his emerging cynicism about the next stages of his life. Even here however ""Boyhood"" leaves room for few more revelations that impact Masons thought process. An ideological prequel to the ""Before"" movies Linklaters sprawling approach tracks the evolution of Masons intellect. Surrounded by expectations and vaguely worded advice from his confused elders he finally obtains the ability to operate as a wholly independent thinker willing to push back. Linklater masterfully foregrounds the juxtaposition between Masons inquisitive younger self (""Theres no such thing as real magic in the world right?"" asks the 10-year-old) and the college-aged thinker in the closing act who rationalizes his increasing worldview. Despite keeping its tantalizing premise in constant focus ""Boyhood"" does feature the occasional lapses in quality awkward lines of dialogue and some broadly scripted supporting characters come and go but theyre generally forgivable in light of the larger tapestry that never wavers in the slightest. Linklater glues together the discombobulated proceedings with distinct ingredients that define each period changing video game consoles flip phones music cues that range from Coldplay and Weezer in earlier scenes to snippets of the recent Daft Punk album. These signposts are helpful for the sake of orientation but rarely over-pronounced. Instead the movie constantly sublimates its widening ideas into passing exchanges.  ""Any dipshit can take pictures"" one of Masons teachers tells him when hes been lapsing on his studies. ""It takes a real genius to make art."" One assumes that Linklater felt similarly when he started ""Boyhood"" though the result hardly contains any indications of presumptuousness. Instead Linklater relishes the small moments that epitomize Masons flow of experiences. During a camping trip with his dad clearly shot years ago the pair have a hilariously prescient exchange about the ""Star Wars"" franchise and determine it could never accommodate additional movies. Retroactively a sly commentary on the upcoming sequels the conversation implies that not all ambitious filmmaking must be tethered to commercial intensions. Its one scene among many rendered insightful by the passage of time surrounding them -- the central tenet at the heart of ""Boyhood"" that makes it Linklaters shrewdest accomplishment to date and a de facto celebration of his ongoing commitment to moving forward.

Deep ones tend to be glum. ""Boyhood"" fills you with openhearted happiness and awe at its scope and daring. Its a low-key masterpiece a wistful comedy that never forgets to keep genuine emotions foremost. Richard Linklaters domestic epic looks at the common things in life in an uncommon way. It traces the youth of a good suburban Texas child over the course of 12 years. Linklater shot the movie in chunks from 2002 to 2013. We watch Mason Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) evolve from a dreamy tadpole first-grader to a lanky college freshman. Within this cozy focus Linklater contends with the ways we come to terms with our lives practically culturally economically theologically and emotionally. Its a bold undertaking yet ""Boyhood"" wears its novelty lightly. It never feels contrived or though it tells a universal tale predictable. Our heros pest of an older sister Samantha (Linklaters daughter Lorelei a real firecracker) grows into an independent confident young woman. Their divorced parents Mason and Olivia (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) add wrinkles and imperfect new partners and pounds. Looking backward one can usually discern a trail find a design in what at the time seemed to be spontaneous decisions. Seen in reverse a glib storyteller can force a certain unity on lifes random moments. Linklater delights in the improvisatory raggedness of daily existence. The usual mile markers of a coming-of-age tale -- the first kiss the big touchdown the funeral -- are notably absent. The events that punctuate ""Boyhood"" are small-scale and sweet love songs to moments and sensations. Scenes flow casually. The film is astutely observant of compelling little moments. Early on young Mason Jr. and Olivia repaint his bedroom before moving to a new apartment. When he brushes over the door frame where pencil marks charted his height you feel the twinge of something irreplaceable being lost. Linklater has not only a directors eye for detail but a generous soul that makes him share all his characters inexpressible feelings. Matt Lankes  IFC Films Audiences watch Mason (Ellar Coltrane) grow from a young boy into a young man in Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood."" Coltrane is an actor of exceptional promise. In his early scenes hes sort of a background player in his own life dutifully following the dictates of adults who seem to have things all figured out. Hes beyond touching in a sequence when hes trying to figure out whether Harry Potters magical kids exist in the real world. His dad gently lets him down but tells him that there are miraculous creatures like whales. Just to be certain and maybe hoping to hear of a supernatural being his father ignored the boy follows up ""But right this minute are there elves?"" Few questions yield such certain answers. Over time he realizes grown-ups are bluffing most of the time. They have no idea whats coming next. One day theyre cheering Roger Clemens on the Astros pitching mound then theyre indicting him in a steroid scandal. No wonder he grows up to be an inquisitive young man whimsically vexed by the lack of logic in the universe. The adults grow alongside the children. Hawke is disarming as a man who became a father before he was done being a child himself. Arquettes character strong and careworn and prone to falling for the wrong kind of man anchors her every scene in honesty. Her reaction to Mason becoming the kind of man she needed but 20 years late is all too uncomfortably real. As is her frustration that her kids childhood with all its tribulations was over so damned fast. Linklater knows when were expecting drama and playfully uses our instincts against us. At one point in Mason Jr.s adolescence he hangs out at a construction site with older boys. These louts drink beer boast about probably fictional sexual adventures and throw circular saw blades into Sheetrock like ninja throwing stars. Images of severed fingers and slit arteries dance in our imagination. Linklater teases our anxieties disarms our fear then turns our sigh of relief into a joke. The final shot of Mason meshing with his new surrogate family of college friends feels like the most perfectly natural place to leave it on a reward that the lead character has genuinely earned. ""Boyhood"" moves you to laugh to think and best of all to feel.

Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Richard Linklaters long-forming project charting the growth of its subject Mason in real time from age six to eighteen is not entirely unprecedented; Michael Apteds ""7 Up"" documentaries revisited the same British children every seven years as they grew older Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel series cast the same actor as the eponymous character over the course of four feature films and Linklaters own ""Before"" trilogy caught up with its protagonists every nine years much as they caught up with one another. Rare though is the opportunity to see a cast age naturally over the span of a single film and yet Linklater had the incredible patience and foresight to reunite with lead Ellar Coltrane parents played by Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and Lorelei Linklater his own daughter on an annual basis to capture piecemeal Masons growth from a hapless child of divorce into a young man of promise. The result is a movie made up of unlikely moments -- I dont believe we see a single wedding or funeral a welcome contrast to the carefully dictated milestones of last years supposedly life-affirming ""About Time"" -- that marks the passing years much as anyone does with changes in pop music fashion technology politics and entertainment. For instance Olivia (Arquette) is shown early on reading the first ""Harry Potter"" novel to her children Mason (Coltrane) and Samantha (L. Linklater) and in due time we watch as they eagerly line up at midnight to purchase the sixth volume. Its a constant in their lives even as Mom moves them all around Texas from Houston to San Marcos to Austin and even as Mason Sr. (Hawke) makes sporadic appearances in their lives. In the meantime Mason Jr. grows up -- fighting bullies dating girls fearing stepdads finding hobbies (graffiti) developing passions (photography) and gradually becoming his own man. To that penultimate point a teacher tells Mason that ""any dipsht can take pictures its hard to make art"" and to his credit R. Linklater is not merely taking pictures over a carefully prolonged photo shoot. The story grew as his lead did and the writer/director is wise enough to know that life tends to be both experienced and recalled with a certain fluidity. The passage of time in ""Boyhood"" often arrives casually as we realize that Masons family has found a new home or that our young man has a new haircut or that ostensibly significant moments have already taken place off-screen. After all memories themselves arent tidily restricted to emotional highs and lows; theres a whole lot of in-between and its in this space that the film thrives with its funniest tensest saddest exchanges. (In some of the films savviest moments Linklater wisely plays against our expectations of potential injury from other more calculating films. Mistakes are sometimes made by the characters but ""accidents"" arent simply tossed into the narrative in order to drum up suspense and sympathy. Enough of both is earned simply from these tumultuous relationships and the uncertainty of daily existence.) Hawke and Arquette are expectedly excellent throughout and the directors daughter brings a charming sense of antagonism and eventual respect to scenes with her on-screen brother but this is inevitably Coltranes film to carry. Even when hes surrounded by somewhat stilted teenage line readings the maturing actor manages to give a convincingly unaffected performance entirely in line with the cameras casually observational approach. Whether or not this leading man has the chops (or interest) to star in another film remains to be seen but as the emotional anchor of his own story Coltrane pulls off an unenviable feat in nearly every scene. The most singular image of the film comes when a pre-teen Mason is asked to paint over the growth marks in a doorway as Mom packs up their things. Just because the lines and dates are gone doesnt mean that he and his sister will somehow stop growing and much of what follows comes from a place of wisdom and perspective almost entirely unseen in American cinema (if anything this project merits comparison to the likes of everyday epics ""Yi Yi"" and ""The Best of Youth""). Like the best of fiction it conveys greater truth about coming to terms with the world at large and regardless of whether each individual scene is ultimately justified in its inclusion the cumulative impact of seeing something resembling a life unfold over a mere two hours and forty minutes is overwhelming. ""Boyhood"" is Linklaters third masterpiece in the past decade and it should only affect anyone whos ever been someone elses sibling child parent lover or friend.

TWITTER Richard Linklaters latest film is an epic about growing up banal family life and forging an identity. A unique work in American cinema shot in 39 days over the course of 12 years Boyhood is an epic about the ordinary growing up the banality of family life and forging an identity. Everything here has been seen in movies and on television countless times before -- marital spats a divorced dad trying to connect with kids he sporadically sees teenagers acting out parents having to let go -- but perhaps never has the long arc of the journey from childhood to college been portrayed as cohesively and convincingly as Richard Linklater has done in a film that can be plain on a moment-to-moment basis but is something quite special in its entirety. IFC Films faces a tough challenge with this theatrically since other than serious film buffs and Linklater fans its very hard to identify the audience that will come out for a two-and-a-half-hour observational chronicle of childhood; its not really a film for kids although they would relate to much in it and many adults will shy away due to a perception that it is. Still there is little doubt that over time Boyhood will be seen and deeply appreciated by viewers young and old on various formats and in different ways with the end result that it will endure. Every single aspect of the subject here has been grist for dramatists through the ages as well as for endless sitcoms -- the bickering small joys misunderstandings wedlock fissures adolescent rebellions first loves the birth of artistic inclinations and emotional growth through pain and disappointment. Eschewing melodrama and farce Linklater approaches all these subjects and many others in the same straightforward unblinking manner as parts of the grand fabric of life. What seem like huge issues for a moment can often be quickly forgotten while tiny incidents can remain in the mind forever; its the selective but cumulative use of seemingly arbitrary but significant experiences that gives Boyhood its distinctive character and impressive weight. Linklater shot in short spurts periodically between 2002 and 2013a"" calling the name actors to Texas to join the locals playing the dozensa"" of characters who come and go. This approach clearly involved some a""real risk as over such a long period some participants could havea"" died become unwilling to continue or somehow evolved physically a""and/or emotionally in ways that might have been unsuitable for the a""story as the writer-director roughly conceived it in advance.a"" The film moves along from one time period to another withouta"" warning or announcement and watching the aging process of the a""performers is inevitably fascinating. The two major professionals in a""the cast Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette who play the divorced a""parents Mason Sr. and Olivia thicken and mature gracefully over the a""course of the years. But where Linklater was really lucky was witha"" Ellar Coltrane a local kid whos cute as a little boy and in his a""midteens sprouts into a cool thoughtful slim and quite attractivea"" guy. In a typical fictional film it would normally require three a""different young actors to portray the same character over this agea"" range; to see this one young man inhabit all these stages of Masons a""life is unique and quite astonishing to behold.a"" PHOTOS Exclusive Portraits of Aaron Paul Kristen Stewart Keira Knightley Zoe Saldana and More at Sundance The only comparison that comes to mind for this sort of extended a""real-life chronological continuum is Michael Apteds still-ongoing Up series which has followed the group of original participants a""(with one or two drop-outs) over the decades. But thats a a""documentary. What takes a little getting used to in Boyhood is that a""in fact it is not a documentary. The initial passages with Olivia a""picking Mason up from school and driving through town Mason spray-painting graffiti on a wall and his older sister Samanthaa"" (Lorelei Linklater the directors daughter) being sassy appear soa"" verite-like that the written dialogue sounds rather stilted. This a""impression is forgotten once the kids long-absent dad returns froma"" Alaska only to be assaulted verbally by the still-wounded Olivia (the a""reason for their breakup goes unspecified; Mason Sr. does come offa"" like a tomcat while he informs the kids that their mom is ""a piece of a""work"").a"" Living hand-to-mouth Olivia moves the kids to Houston so she can a""go to college; they hate changing schools as they will again down the a""line; Olivia marries again to an overbearing professor with children a""of his own who turns out to be a violent alcoholic; the kids line up a""with hundreds of others in costume one midnight to buy Harry Potter a""and the Half-Blood Prince; big Mason turns up again takes them to an a""Astros game (Roger Clemens mows down the Brewers) and shakes his kidsa"" out of their sullenness by insisting they talk to him about reala"" stuff; dad dragoons the kids into helping him campaign for Obama in a""2008 (the ""hope"" is tangible); Samantha has her first boyfriend at 15a"" and Mason Jr.s voice is suddenly deep when his old man takes him on a""a summer camping trip.a"" The smallest moments can be the most telling The kids wondering ifa"" their dad is sleeping with a redhead who chats him up in a restaurant; a""Samanthas understandable embarrassment upon her dads prying abouta"" her first romance; father and sons bonding over their agreement that a""the Star Wars franchise was finished with Return of the Jedi; Dads advice to his son about how the best way to succeed with girls a""is to ask a lot of questions and then genuinely listen to them; and a""young Masons crushing disappointment that his father has sold the GTO a""that when he was kid hed promised to give him on his 16th birthday.a"" PHOTOS The Scene at Sundance Film Festival 2014 There are other more overt milestones Olivia becoming a successfula"" teacher; the kids adjusting to yet another step-father -- an initially a""impressive and buff Iraq War vet who like his predecessor becomes ana"" abusive drunk -- as well as a step-mother whose mother is a a""Jesus freak and father is a gun nut (both of whom could not be nicer);a"" Samantha leaving for college while young Mason develops a passion for a""art photography as well as for the most beautiful girl at school (Zoea"" Graham) whom hes lucky enough to have as his first girlfriend buta"" who will also certainly break his heart.a"" With all the geographic educational parental and emotional a""adjustments Mason and Samantha are forced to make they do pretty wella"" all things considered which brings to mind the overriding theme ofa"" Francois Truffauts films about children which was their resilience.a"" With all the childhood traumas extreme behavior and tragedies thata"" have been depicted in both narrative and documentary films over thea"" last couple of decades its both bracing and refreshing to see morea"" normal (if far from ideal) youthful experience represented in such aa"" nonmelodramatic and credible way.a"" There are many indelible passages in Boyhood along with a fewa"" stretches that are less than compelling even boring.

Filmed in sequence across 12 years this unprecedented experiment in long-term storytelling attempts to capture child actor Ellar Coltranes coming-of-age on camera while stubbornly resisting the impulse to impose artificial drama on his relatively typical Texan adolescence. The tradeoff is a nearly three-hour film with little narrative thrust beyond the inevitable passage of time. Thats plenty for Linklater who has had years to digest and accept creative decisions that might elude first-time viewers. Critical support coupled with audiences natural curiosity about the stunt should translate to reasonable business for this brave IFC-backed project which challenges popular notions of dramatic development. These days Hollywood mostly subscribes to Alfred Hitchcocks philosophy ""What is drama after all but life with the dull bits cut out?"" By contrast Linklater embraces those dull bits treating milestones and banal moments with equal weight and relying on the cumulative effect rather than rigging any one of the films 143 scenes to supply its emotional impact. (Lets not forget to whom Hitch was speaking at the time either His interviewer French director Francois Truffaut went on to make one of the great naturalistic films about childhood with ""Small Change."") With ""Boyhood"" Linklater has created an uncanny time capsule inviting auds to relive their own upbringing through a series of artificial memories pressed like flowers between the pages of a family photo album. But he is equally invested in creating new ones as we come to know Coltranes fictional Mason and his slightly older sister Samantha (Linklaters daughter Lorelei) via scenes that span nearly a dozen years (requiring only 39 shooting days during that time). Mason is just 7 years old at the outset doing all those things East Texas boys his age might spraying graffiti on walls studying the lingerie section of a mail-order catalog with friends squabbling with his sister. Each of these memories might be expected to fade in time but not the move to Houston that wraps this opening stretch as Mason watches his best friend bicycling after their departing car. SEE MORE Richard Linklater Ethan Hawke on the Making of Boyhood (VIDEO) Linklater manages to incorporate such scenes with minimal sentimentality building a life through naturalistic vignettes talking contraception with Dad (Ethan Hawke) doing chores around the house being pushed around at school flirting on the first job and so on. The director would allow approximately a year to pass between shoots picking up to find the characters slightly transformed each time. In Houston Masons father re-enters the picture back from Alaska and determined to be a ""fun dad"" Hawkes character comes loaded with presents taking the kids out for bowling and junk food. Mason wants to know whether he and their mom Olivia (Patricia Arquette) will get back together and such questions press on our imaginations as well. The expectation -- early on at least -- is that the film will conform to other stories where every detail holds significance as part of some grand design. But life doesnt come neatly divided into distinct dramatic acts and Linklater wants to capture the experience of childhood as authentically as possible even if it means sacrificing the sort of inciting incident or long-term goal that typically sustains audience interest across a narrative. Here the stakes are those of any parent We are concerned for Masons well-being and want to see him turn out all right. But in the absence of traditional exposition we are also desperate for context flailing to reposition ourselves each time the film jumps forward. Lovers come and go in both parents lives. Whenever Olivia finds a decent man she marries him until such time that his temper becomes too much to bear. The first of these separations brings dramatic fireworks early in the film rendered all the more intense by the fact that Mason and Samantha are forced to leave their new siblings behind with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather (Marco Perella). The next one disappears without so much as an explanation just one of the innumerable influences on the shaping of Masons emerging identity. Its not until Masons 15th birthday that the young man fully emerges as a Linklater character -- that is someone inclined to express his personal philosophy aloud even if it means alienating his too-pretty-to-last high school g.f. (Evie Thompson). The film could conceivably have been more effective had it opened with the character in his midteens perhaps flashing back to glimpses of a younger Mason (peering around a corner while his mom argues for example) but Linklater commits to a linear approach that inches forward from elementary school until his arrival at college. Parents with grown kids in the audience will likely be the most affected emotionally by ""Boyhood"" which culminates with Mason leaving the nest as seen through the eyes of all those who watched him grow up. As the moment sinks in Olivia cries ""I just thought there would be more"" and she may as well be speaking on behalf of all the younger viewers Mason is 19 when the film ends and those his age will recognize many of the same cultural touchstones -- from videogame systems to favorite pop songs to vague memories of 9/11 and Obamas first election (as something important to their parents generation) -- even as they struggle to grasp why a story that lacks conventional conflict or melodrama still deserves their attention. For them ""Boyhood"" must be given time to sink in. Like so many of Linklaters projects ""Boyhood"" will no doubt ripen with age. Certainly theres an enormous difference between the film as it is experienced at the moment of projection and the one that will settle in the days and months to follow. Nearly all the helmers pics so thoroughly reflect the moment of their creation that it would be fascinating to screen the film alongside a retrospective of the other work hes created over the past 12 years. Somewhat counter-intuitively sticking to the same young actor (instead of casting the character with lookalikes of various ages as other movies do) doesnt necessarily solve the problem of working with kids Coltrane is still stiff and somewhat unconvincing for the first few years of the project but gradually grows more comfortable oncamera as he matures into a remarkably self-assured young man. Meanwhile Lorelei Linklater has the opposite effect making a stronger impression than Mason early on then retreating into the background as her screen brother comes into his own. Of course in the span of time it took to make ""Boyhood"" Linklater and Hawke also decided to follow up their 1995 swooner ""Before Sunrise"" adding sequels nine and 18 years later. Apart from documaker Michael Apted (who checks in with 14 British kids every seven years for his ""Up"" series) these two time-lapse dramas position Linklater as the director most attuned to the effects of time on characters. Theres a rough-edged organic quality to ""Boyhood"" that recalls the work of those European helmers Linklater so admires Fassbinder Bergman Bresson. On one hand both the casting and decision to shoot on 35mm (right up to the formats demise) give the project a uniformity of appearance and yet even though he claims to have decided on the last shot two years into the project nothing feels predetermined. Linklater allowed the script to evolve as Coltrane did which explains why it feels less organized than we might want or expect. Barely finished in time for Sundance (with end credits and music clearances still incomplete) ""Boyhood"" was conceived as a chance to discover -- rather than impose -- a fate on Masons character. Now after a very long wait audiences finally have the chance to do the same. BoyhoodReviewed at Sundance Film Festival (Premieres) Jan. 19 2014. Running time 162 MIN.

Movies | Inside Movies Sundance 2014 Richard Linklaters entrancing Boyhood captures the Zen of growing up by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Boyhood Posted January 20 2014 -- 600 AM EST Richard Linklaters Boyhood which premiered at Sundance last night is an entrancing one-of-a-kind act of dramatic storytelling a beautiful stunt of a movie. It was shot over a period of 12 years beginning in 2002 and it takes two hours and 40 minutes to tell the story of a boy named Mason as he grows up in Texas. The hook of the movie - and if it is a stunt its a visionary one - is that Mason is played throughout by a young actor named Ellar Coltrane who we literally watch grow up year after year on camera. That makes the film a kind of cousin to Michael Apteds series of Up documentaries but Im not sure if this sort of thing has ever been attempted in a work of cinematic fiction before. Linklater of course is a storyteller who reveres the art of naturalism and Boyhood though its a genuine movie full of bustlingly staged scenes and performances and motifs and arcs has the feel of a staged documentary about a fictional character. Its lively and boisterous and very entertaining to watch because stuff keeps happening but the film also rolls forward in an almost Zen manner so that everything that occurs - an angry family dinner a camping trip a haircut an afternoon of videogames - carries the same wide-eyed you are here significance. The film has that deadpan Linklater tone of slacker haphazardness but you could also say that its almost Joycean in its appreciation of the scruffy magic of everyday life. Nothing about Mason on the surface is all that remarkable. He starts off as a cute quiet downy-haired boy with chipmunk features living with his mom played with increasingly intense and fulminating ferocity by Patricia Arquette and his slightly older very spunky sister played by Lorelei Linklater (the directors daughter). The parents are divorced and the childrens father played by Ethan Hawke starts off as an amiable quasi-deadbeat who shows up once in a while in his black GTO to take them out for junk food and bowling. The shifts from year to year dont happen with any fanfare. There are no titles and the episodes arent set off from each other. For a while its fun identifying what moment were in from the little cultural signifiers that Linklater has scattered into the action (look its an old blue iMac The use of a catchphrase like ""Awk-ward"" The video for Lady Gagas ""Telephone""). Yet every 13 minutes or so (on average) well notice that Mason looks a little older with occasional jarring my-how-youve-grown leaps as he moves into adolescence. Part of the excitement of the movie is that Linklater by definition could not have had any idea who Ellar Coltrane would turn out to be - what he would look like how his personality would evolve - as he got older and as Mason grows up Coltrane though he is most definitely an actor here (and a fine one) effectively merges with the character. Mason turns out to be an angelically good-looking kid with dirty-blond hair falling into his face. Girls are drawn to him because hes handsome in that thick sensual way that adolescents have and hes got a slightly downbeat dreaminess about him a passivity that results from his impulse to lay back and soak up the world. We can see when Ellar Coltrane is very young that passivity is simply his temperament; its what his DNA made him. But as Mason gets older his slightly recessive hanging-back observational quality begins to sync up with something in the air of the culture. Mason is a Linklater hero all right not just because he becomes an art-minded shutterbug but because he enjoys living without really doing anything. As a teenager he starts to get called on the carpet for it (by teachers by the manager of the restaurant where he buses tables) and when his high-school photography instructor corners him in the darkroom and gives him a reprimanding speech about how its not enough to have talent youve got to have discipline too we know the teacher is probably offering him good advice yet what Mason does - going with the flow working at the things he loves and letting everything else slide - is as the movie sees it the special grace of youth. Were not meant to be that disciplined when were young and so just maybe the film suggests its wrong that we now expect our children to be that way. Early on when Mason is around 9 or 10 his mother who has moved the family to Houston so that she can finish college winds up marrying her psych professor and that turns out to be a dastardly mistake Hes a drinker with anger issues and for a while he makes their home into a nightmare of reckless ""discipline."" These scenes are highly charged especially when the addict stepdad turns violent and they set us up to think that the movie inside its one-thing-after-another framework is going to provide some real meat-and-potatoes drama. But once Arquettes fraught responsible mom ditches this mistake the movie grows more laid-back. Theres another lout of a husband this one an Iraq War veteran (you have no idea what draws her to these men) but the teenage Mason isnt fazed by him just as he doesnt harbor too much concern for the future. There are funny and intriguing felicities throughout Boyhood whether its Mason doing a walk of shame into school wearing the crewcut his stepdad gave him only to get a flirty note from a girl saying that she thinks the buzzcut looks ""kewl""; or the great speech that Ethan Hawkes hipster dad delivers to Mason about a mixtape of tracks from the Beatles solo albums that merges the artists who recorded them into a group again making the songs sound that much more Beatle-like; to watching the way that Lorelei Linklater as Masons sister grows up into a lovely girl who learns to fashion her brattiness into something elegant. I would say that the movie is in fact a little too long. Yet it remains throughout an agreeably casual epic. It touches something deep and true which is that we grow up to be the people we are by letting every moment form us.

"Sundance Watching a whole life unfold in Richard Linklaters Boyhood | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSundance Watching a whole life unfold in Richard Linklaters BoyhoodReal magic came to Sundance 2014 Sunday night in the form of Richard Linklaters spellbinding child-to-adult life story Boyhood which had its world premiere at the festival.The film ""Boyhood"" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival; it was filmed over the course of more than a decade.  (Courtesy Sundance Institute)  From left to right cast members Ethan Hawke Ellar Coltrane Lorelei Linklater Patricia Arquette and writer and director Richard Linklater attend the pose premiere of the film ""Boyhood"" during the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on Sunday Jan. 19n Park City Utah.  (Danny Moloshok / Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticMon. Jan. 20 2014PARK CITY UTAH--Early in Richard Linklaters masterful new film Boyhood a young boy asks his father if there is really such a thing as magic in the world.The father stumbles over the answer but the truth was plain to see on the big screen during a world premiere late Sunday evening in a packed Eccles Theatre.Real magic had come to Sundance 2014 in the form of a spellbinding child-to-adult life story running 160 minutes that Linklater began filming in 2002 and barely completed in time for this years festival.The top draw of Sundance this year and in fact for any year in recent memory Boyhood is still awaiting a release date expected later in 2014.More Sundance coverage on thestar.comArticle Continued BelowMitt Romney Ethan Hawke and Zach Braff Highlights from Sundance Film FestivalThe Skeleton Twins a hit at Utah filmfestCanadas Eh Team of Sundance volunteersFor almost 12 years beginning exactly 4207 days before Sundays premiere Texas writer/director Linklater followed the growth of a young actor named Ellar Coltrane who was just 6 years old when the camera started rolling. He was 18 when the final scene was shot last October.Boyhood is a narrative drama but it unfolds like documentary truth. Coltrane plays a Texas boy named Mason who is trying to grow up normally in a family tested by divorce alcoholism and other life stresses.Actors Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play Masons estranged parents while Linklaters daughter Lorelei plays his sister Samantha.They also worked on the film for 12 years just part of the incredible commitment and faith in Linklater that people demonstrated in the making of Boyhood from the producers on down.Every year for several days Linklater would shoot up to 15 minutes of film which he would edit and compile as he went along.It all comes together on the screen in a manner than is hard to describe but the effect is almost overwhelming. You see Coltrane age from child to adult before your very eyes as well as the other actors and in the process its like watching your own life unfold.Linklater uses musical cues beginning with the early 2000s Coldplay hit ""Yellow"" and concluding with the 2013 Daft Punk smash ""Get Lucky"" to help subconsciously guide us along.We watch as technology changes from relatively primitive cellphones and video games into smartphones and high-definition online games.There are also topical references to the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama but Linklater thankfully doesnt put us through a chronological march step.He said during the post-screening Qamp;A that he was originally using ""more abrupt transitions that were kind of clever"" in early assemblies of the film but he decided to dispense with most of them to make the aging process more organic.It certainly works. The viewer is totally engaged not only in following the steady growth of Mason as he navigates the victories and defeats of life but also looking for subtle clues that reveal what year it is.Actor Coltrane now 19 stood shyly on the Eccles stage next to his castmates and Linklater and talked of what being in Boyhood meant to him.""Around 12 or 13 it began to gradually dawn on me what was actually happening ...""I think early on it was more of a challenge and later on the character started to merge more with my actual life. It became much easier.""Boyhood seems like a summation of Linklaters incredible career. The film works on a stream-of-consciousness level like his earlier Waking Life but also expresses deep thoughts about life and love similar to his 16-year Before trilogy romantic series -- Before Sunrise Before Sunset and Before Midnight -- the latter of which premiered at Sundance last year.""I wanted to do something about childhood and when I really sat down to write I couldnt pick one moment in childhood ... and so I just got this eureka moment why couldnt you just film a little bit and encompass all of it?"" Linklater said.But it was quite the awesome time commitment for the actors which his daughter never let him forget.""I remember about year three Lorelei came to me and asked me Could my character like die? ... but she got back into it Linklater said to roars of audience laughter.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsWhen and why Sophie Gregoire Trudeau accepts designer giftsFive fashion gifts given to Sophie Gregoire Trudeau have come to light recently with some people criticizing her acceptance of them though the items fall within Canadian conflict of interest guidelines.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Teenage voices drop waists thicken and in one turn nobody could have predicted moppet Ellar Coltrane playing the younger child of a divorced couple develops into a magnetically internal student and heartbreaker. Cool as it sounds this long-game gimmick doesnt automatically guarantee profundity. Linklater the least pretentious and most relaxed of American filmmakers would probably say so himself. But amazingly depth is what he achieves by letting the years play out in an uninterrupted three-hour flow and lingering on moments that most films would cut for pace. Boyhood feels unprecedented in its intimacy; the process is quietly radical (with a hat tip to Francois Truffauts 20-year Antoine Doinel series that began with The 400 Blows in 1959) but the unassuming script even more so. Were introduced to the clan in impressionistic bursts. Olivia (Patricia Arquette) a single mother heading back to college preps her kids for relocation to Houston while cool dad Mason (Ethan Hawke) shows up in a muscle car on weekends for trips to the bowling alley. You root for their reconciliation but the plot has other plans bringing on a procession of new boyfriends for Olivia most notably a college professor who becomes a vicious alcoholic (Marco Perella). Hawkes character meanwhile drops the attitude and the wheels eventually marrying a sweet conservative from a religious family. Both Arquette and Hawke turn in understated portrayals of long-term compromise Linklater steering them to the kind of parental wisdom that can only develop over time. Just as vividly the kids experiment with various musical phases (Britney Spears to Bright Eyes) and small acts of rebellion growing into independent thinkers. Is Boyhood the most nuanced home movie of all time? Not quite and calling it that would diminish Linklaters achievement. Better to say that it retrains us to let go of melodramatic expectations and simply let life unfold a remarkably sophisticated ambition. To some degree thats what Linklater has been doing with his Before Sunrise trilogy created over an 18-year period. But Boyhood has a scope thats more thorough and epic. Unshakable witty and deeply felt the film will be paying emotional dividends for a long long time.
