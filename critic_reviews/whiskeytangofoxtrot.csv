The movie directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Focus I Love You Phillip Morris) offers some light modifications to Barkers experience Kim (now surnamed ""Baker"") is a television rather than newspaper reporter; the setting for the action is abbreviated into simply ""Afghanistan""; people have been blended together to create efficient composites.The basic premise though is the same Kim (Fey) unsatisfied by her desk-jockey job--and just as unsatisfied by her relationship with her ""mildly depressive"" boyfriend (Josh Charles)--volunteers to cover the war in Afghanistan for her news network. Initially clueless about the chaos shes been plunged into (she angers the locals loses her money gets scammed by a kid confuses ""Afghans"" and ""Afghanis"" etc.) Kim gets her bearings with the help of her fixer Fahim (Christopher Abbott) and of the rowdy expat community she finds in Kabul. The Westerners--war correspondents war photographers bodyguards--are fueled by a cocktail of sex and drugs and actual cocktails; they are in Afghanistan but in another sense they are very much not. They call the space theyve carved for themselves ""the Kabubble.""Whiskey Tango Foxtrots plot revolves around the thing most any movie about war correspondents (including yes that one) will the tension presented by people who are on the one hand heroes risking their lives to tell important stories and on the other the framework goes self-indulgent adrenaline junkies. Kim in short order discovers the dangerous romance of war that is not ones own She falls a little bit in love with the conflict shes covering.Just as the movie is about to make a point ... it instead makes a joke.This makes for a war comedy in the tradition of MASH and Catch-22 and Tropic Thunder and Wag the Dog but that differs from its predecessors in an important way Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is oddly enough a rom-com. And while Kim may engage in an inevitable flirtation with a lascivious fellow-expat (a dashing Martin Freeman) the real lover here--sensitive and seductive and complicated and impossible--is war itself. Kims suitor is the ongoing quagmire that one Marine she interviews refers to as the ""forgotten war--capital F capital W."" The conflict excites Kim and fulfills her and saves her from herself. It completes her. It has her at hello. At one point she pretty much chases it down in an airport.And as in any good rom-com much of the dramatic tension in the movie stems from romantic uncertainty Kim being an American she always has the option to change her mind and break things off.Its a morally messy premise. Afghanistan is not Colin Firth. War is not Love Actually. And that is the problem with Whiskey Tango Foxtrot which is overall a charming comedy about a terrible war It is a charming comedy about a terrible war. It flirts with the big ideas implicit in its story--the dangers of casual colonialism the limits of cultural relativism the failings of American interventionism--and then just as it seems ready to make a point ... it instead makes a joke. At one moment a joke about Kim and her ignorance. (Mocked by a colonel--the scene-stealing Billy Bob Thornton--for bringing a bright orange backpack on an embed she protests ""The girl in the North Face store said it was like military grade"") At another a joke about Kims 40-something-single-lady status. (She first gets assigned to Afghanistan because as her assigner puts it she is one of the few ""unmarried childless people in this bureau."") At another a joke about Kim and her privilege. (Kim explains why she took the Kabul assignment to a fellow expat. ""That is officially the most American-white-lady story Ive ever heard"" the expat replies.)Theres also A joke about Afghan men thinking that Kim ""would make a handsome boy."" A joke about burqas. (Donning one for the first time Kim exclaims ""Its so pretty I dont even want to vote"") A joke about the many challenges and ironies of a Western woman navigating a Muslim country. (Woman on the street ""Cover your head you shameless whore"" Fahim Kims fixer ""She says uh welcome to Afghanistan."")And on and on. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot--we might as well refer to it as WTF--was adapted for the screen by Robert Carlock and produced by Fey and Lorne Michaels. And it is in many ways tonally similar to that teams other productions among them the Fey-Carlock-Michaels collaboration of 30 Rock and the Fey-Carlock one of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The film like its small-screen predecessors marries big themes and small. It is witty and wry and gimlet-eyed. (Though to be fair tequila seems to be the booze of choice for the expats in the ""Kabubble."") It is cartoonish in its satire. It is full of classic gallows humor--the kind that has long helped people to cope with the most inconvenient and most horrific aspects of being people in the first place.That makes some sense Carlock wanted WTF he has said to walk the tightrope that its war-comedy predecessors have. He wanted to create a film ""that dealt with horror and absurdity at the same time."" And indeed WTF achieves some of that. As an Eat Pray Love-esque travelogue and a Wild-style bildungsroman it is laudably interested in humanizing war the worlds most animalistic institution. Its heart is well-placed.And Tina Fey finally playing a character rather than a caricature proves once again that she can ably carry a film. While there are moments when Liz Lemons sour self-deprecation leaks through Feys Kim is for the most part subtle and warm and human. She makes you care whether her decidedly un-quiet American will stay in her relationship with war or whether she will--like so many of her compatriots--leave it behind forgotten.But fighting against all that admirable nuance are the not one but many jokes (jokes that are bafflingly familiar when it comes to Fey) about Kim ""looking like a boy"" and about Afghan womens burqas--uniformly blue--looking like ""IKEA bags."" There is the peppy music--a-has ""Take on Me"" Alvin and the Chipmunkss Christmas song--serving as a soundtrack to war. (In one particularly egregious moment Harry Nilssons cheesy ballad ""Without You""--I cant liiiiiiive ... if living is without youuuuuu--plays while people are being shot to death. Its the alienation effect unnecessarily ironized for the big screen.) And then there is the really? in 2016? fact that white actors Girlss Abbott and Alfred Molina play the films two principal Afghan characters.There is also the fact that WTF takes a complicated set of problems--war poverty betrayal love--and in place of making a statement about them throws up its hands. What does it think actually about the quagmire in Afghanistan? Unclear. The film suggests that it might have Things to Say about world politics and feminism and the pulsing connection between one small human and the lot of us; ultimately though it says very little. This is made clear when its heroine in a fit of self-realization talks about her need to tell stories about ""the real world""--her implication being that Afghanistan her Afghanistan does not belong to it. WTF may not be ""a political movie"" but it does as Tina Fey explained it ""make the point that people have been going to this part of the world trying to fix it for 1000 years and it is what it is. No ones ever going to get a handle on [it].""The movie claims the amnesty of satire without fully clarifying who in the end is the butt of its jokes.WTF for all its heart and ambition suffers rather than benefits from tonal ambiguity It is earnest one moment and sarcastic the next Platoon one moment and Under the Tuscan Sun the next. In part certainly that is evidence of nuance. In part too it reflects the chaos of the war it portrays. (Life is messy; movies about it should be too.) But if youre going to engage in successful satire about things like IEDs and drones and cultural imperialism and intersectional feminism and war and poverty and you get the idea you are walking a very narrow tightrope. You need to acquiesce to the demands of Poes Law. You need to convey to your audience that you--and thus by extension they--are in control of the joke. You need to reassure them that your repeated references to ""white lady problems"" are the subjects of mockery rather than endorsement.So WTF is compromised in the end by the same thing 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt have been at times before it It gets lost in its own hall of mirrors. WTF despite and by way of its casual humor shirks. It ducks. It NIMBYs. It claims the amnesty of satire without fully clarifying who in the end is the butt of the joke. Everyone is in some sense. Which also means that no one is.Call it warientalism. WTF does not engage in explicit romanticism or explicit isolationism or that thing sometimes shorthanded as ""war porn"" but it does treat war with an eye that is both gimlety and glib. Here is the soft bigotry of no expectations applied to a country and its conflicts It is what it is as Fey says. And here is the logic of the rom-com too applied to politics and human lives. To frame Afghanistan as an answer to an American womans great search for meaning is also to frame it as a place that can be disposed of when its utility to her has reached its expiration date. Kim has made no commitments to her temporary home. She can swipe left whenever she wants to. The country at that point will have given her her self-awakening; she will have given it very little in return. Comfortably returned to ""the real world"" she will have gotten what she needed from her stay in the Kabubble. All while the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan are left waiting yet again for their punchline.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Review Whiskey Tango Foxtrot looks inside war reporting | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Whiskey Tango Foxtrot looks inside war reporting By SANDY COHEN Mar. 2 2016 1029 PM EST Journalism is having a moment at the movies.Days after the journalism procedural ""Spotlight"" won best picture at the Academy Awards Paramount is releasing ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" a comic drama about war reporting with Tina Fey as a rookie correspondent finding her way.Fey plays Kim Baker a 40-something New York TV producer summoned to a meeting of ""unmarried childless personnel"" to consider a three-month assignment embedded with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Three months becomes three years 2004 to 2006 as Baker evolves from clueless newbie to savvy reporter navigating the countrys repressive cultural norms and the off-the-clock lifestyle of drunken debauchery shared by her expatriate colleagues.Longtime Fey collaborator Robert Carlock (""30 Rock"" Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"") based the screenplay on former Chicago Tribute reporter Kim Barkers memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan.""If ""finding yourself"" in your 40s is a cinematic cliche ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is guilty. And it will surely be criticized for casting white actors as key Afghan characters. But the film offers a fresh look at the adrenaline-laced lifestyle of war correspondents and a timely criticism of TV news. And it delivers some laughs too.Feys Baker is sorely unprepared for her new circumstances. Its like shes even lost her New York smarts when she takes out a wad of American cash on a busy Kabul street. She forgets her headscarf and barges into places where women arent allowed.Her translator Fahim (Christopher Abbot) tries to protect her in the field while fellow journalist Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) guides her through the rowdy ex-pat social scene.As Baker adapts to her new cultures she develops a professional relationship with an Afghan official Sadiq (Alfred Molina always outstanding) and a romantic one with fellow reporter Iain (Martin Freeman). Both test the limits of how far shes willing to go for a story.Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (""WTF"" get it?) may be more drama than comedy which suits the subject matter. Many of the laughs come from subtitles translating the local language Baker inevitably misunderstands. Others come from Feys bumbling and Col. Walter Hollaneks (Billy Bob Thornton) no-nonsense intolerance for such behavior.Ultimately Baker faces two challenges in the film the farfetched one of rescuing her boyfriend from Taliban kidnappers and the more realistic one of not finding an audience for news from what one soldier she interviews describes as a ""forgotten war capital F capital W.""""Everyone loves the troops"" a TV producer tells Baker but no one wants to see them on TV anymore.As newspapers have closed and news conglomerates grown realistic portrayals of the people who gather news are critical to the survival of journalism as a democratic institution. Like the HBO documentary ""Jim The James Foley Story"" WTF"" explores what motivates war correspondents that pursuit of adrenaline and truth. Like ""Spotlight"" which follows four investigative reporters uncovering the Catholic Churchs child-molestation scandal ""WTF"" shows the tenacity characteristic of reporters on any beat.So let journalism have its moment ""WTF."" Oscar and Tina Fey are fine representatives.""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""pervasive language some sexual content drug use and violent war images.""

"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot shows Tina Fey at her best review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWhiskey Tango Foxtrot shows Tina Fey at her best review Dont let the trailer fool you. Tina Fey has her best screen role yet as a Kabul-based TV reporter in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. March 4 2016Whiskey Tango FoxtrotStarring Tina Fey Margot Robbie Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. 111 minutes. Now on at major theatres. 14AOK so its not Spotlight.But Whiskey Tango Foxtrot offers another kind of insiders view of the workings of daily journalism with Tina Fey in her best screen role yet as an Afghanistan-based TV reporter.Article Continued BelowIts tough not to hear Feys voice when reading the source material Chicago Tribune reporter Kim Barkers 2011 engaging memoir The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Writer and actress tilt between insecurity and bravado employing dry observational humour tinged with occasional sentimental flashes only outwardly out of character.Tina Fey is Kim Baker in the journalism tale Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.The trailer does WTF (only thing missing is a hashtag in this marketers dream title win) no favours erroneously making it look like 30 Rocks Liz Lemon in frat-house-meets-war zone goof around.Theres more to this likeable comedy-drama. Most of that is down to Fey as the slightly renamed Kim Baker. She softens her well-loved funny skills to play a character seeking to know -- and perhaps be comfortable with -- herself and since Kim fumbles these tasks regularly it makes her pretty relatable.A stagnant relationship combined with a broadcast newsroom that views Afghanistan as a second-tier war that doesnt merit first-string on-camera reporters gets the underused writer to her first conflict zone in 2003.Shes no pushover but Kim isnt ready for much of what follows whether its the culture shock her general unpreparedness or the stunning revelation that a ""six"" back home is a solid ""nine"" here. That information comes from reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) whos delighted to have a sister in the guest house the international news crews call home and party palace.Gradually Kim learns to navigate strict military rules and the innuendo-laced double speak of a high-ranking Kabul politician (Alfred Molina one of two white actors cast as Afghans).Coping with living in the ""kabubble"" -- the sheltered Westerners world -- annoys her but not as much as the fact the New York news desk sees Afghanistan as a boring war nobody cares about. But Kim does growing fond of the powerful jolt of adrenalin from working under fire while embedded with a Marines unit helmed by a sarcastic general (Billy Bob Thornton).Martin Freeman is solid as flirtatious Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie although screenwriter Robert Carlock (SNL 30 Rock) unfortunately seems to bow to demands to go for a neat resolution in the final reel especially when it comes to Iains part in the story.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; whiskey-tango-foxtrot ) Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (United States 2016) March 04 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli As a satire about the absurdity of war and the way the news media covers it Whiskey Tango Foxtrot has surprisingly dull fangs. Coming from Lorne Michaels and Tina Fey this is especially surprising since neither is known for pulling punches. Nevertheless this dramatic comedy is as close to cuddly as one could imagine from a story set in 2006-ish Afghanistan. Aside from the usual messages - war is hell bad things happen to good people and the American public has a short attention span for overseas conflicts - theres nothing of substance to be found in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. At times its amusing but the jokes rarely provoke full-bellied laughter and the attempts at drama are uneven. At its best this movie recalls Robert Altmans MASH without equaling it but Whiskey Tango Foxtrot often isnt close to that level. The films appeal to the extent that it has appeal comes mostly as a result of Tina Feys inherent likeability. As written her character is underdeveloped but Fey brings a life and energy to the performance that elevates it above the lines found on the screenplays pages. Of Feys co-stars only Martin Freeman has enough screen time to qualify as a solid supporting character. Margot Robbie is underused as a fellow female journalist. Alfred Molina hidden under a bushy beard comes across as a sit-com weasel whose comeuppance although deserved isnt credible. The push-pull of comedy and drama in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is uncertain. On more than one occasion the movie cant decide whether to go for the easy laugh or the jugular and many acceptable narrative shortcuts and cheats that might be acceptable in an overt satire feel artificial in a quasi-dramatic situation. Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa occasionally stumble when trying to weave a seamless tapestry that accommodates humor tragedy and moralizing. Although the movie is comprised of easily digestible morsels none of the characters (with the possible exception of Feys Kim Baker) attains anything close to three-dimensionality. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot opens in 2003 after the war in Afghanistan has been ""won."" With media attention now focusing on operations in Iraq news stations scramble to find personnel to cover the tail of the earlier campaign. Baker a TV news copy editor looking for a new career path agrees to become one of the new faces in Afghanistan - a task that would be difficult enough if she also didnt have to grapple with the rabid gender discrimination evident in the culture. It takes a while for her to get her feet under her but after a period she earns the admiration of her fellow journalists including Brit Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) and Scot Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) as well as the respect of U.S. Marine General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton). But Baker is concerned about the decreasing support shes getting from her network. In a face-to-face meeting with a programming executive shes told that viewers no longer care about Afghanistan and unless she can deliver something attention-getting things arent likely to change. The films goal isnt that different from MASH which used comedy to mask a serious message about the inhumanity and absurdity of war. Robert Altmans scalpel however was considerably sharper than the one wielded by Ficarra and Requa who soft-pedal their points to avoid challenging viewers. ""Edgy"" isnt a word one would use to describe Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. The films secondary mission statement exploring the ""newsworthiness"" of events (at least insofar as the public is concerned) is presented in a perfunctory fashion. The production isnt saying anything new when it (correctly) observes how easily the American public loses interest in a story. Beyond a two-minute exchange between Baker and Cherry Jones executive Whiskey Tango Foxtrot doesnt do anything with this. The movie works so hard not to offend viewers that it ends up offering up a story with all the qualities (positive and negative) of a TV sitcom. I think the film wants to be thought-provoking but its hard to find anything here thats new controversial or interesting. At best Whiskey Tango Foxtrot can be seen as a mildly amusing fish-out-of-water tale about an untrained newswoman thrust into a dangerous situation. Tina Fey is the biggest asset but even shes not sufficient to make it worth more than a marginal recommendation and a suggestion to wait until it shows up on home video.

Bored TV newswoman Kim Baker (Tina Fey successfully and rapidly alternating between aggressively smart and emotionally vulnerable) gets the opportunity to do all that and advance her career the chance to be on camera as a war reporter in Afghanistan What follows is a raucous randy journey of self-discovery in the Kabul ""Kabubble"" where a stateside 4 can be a 10 and an unfulfilled woman can shed her self-doubt and ask an Afghan minister the tough questions. There are perhaps too many descents into wartime slapstick an otherwise excellent Billy Bob Thornton chews out a soldier for wasting an expensive rocket on the enemys beater of a vehicle; Fey dons a burqa and goes sashaying to a bossa nova soundtrack. And yes American existential angst takes center stage in the midst of tremendous human suffering. But directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa move things along fast enough to keep that from sinking in too deeply and Fey holds the spotlight with aplomb. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Frank Masi/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Frank Masi/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Evan Jonigkeit plays Specialist Coughlin and Tina Fey plays Kim Baker in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Frank Masi/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Based on The Taliban Shuffle a 2011 memoir by Chicago Tribune reporter Kim Barker Whiskey Tango Foxtrot opens many fronts on the war in Afghanistan Its a fish-out-of-water comedy with 30 Rocks Tina Fey fumbling through a different brand of chaos; a satirical riff on the absurdities of Americas military presence in the Middle East; a feminist statement on the marginalization of women in journalism and fundamentalist pockets of Afghanistan; a love story in the heightened arena of Kabul (called ""the Kabubble""); and a scathing critique of American commitment to an increasingly forgotten war. Being all these things at once isnt impossible but the degree of difficulty on this particular high dive would be enough to make Greg Louganis tremble on the platform. Written by Robert Carlock Feys partner on 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Focus Crazy Stupid Love) the film does everything just well enough to make you wish it were better. Maybe a rewrite or two a few dropped subplots a couple of different casting choices a little more comedy some bolder direction -- any number of combinations might have given Whiskey Tango Foxtrot that elusive tonal balance its trying so earnestly to strike. The laughs are scattered the emotions are muted and the politics are largely toothless. Yet it still doesnt take much squinting to see the MASH that might have been. With name ever-so-slightly changed to forgive some tweaks to Barkers story Fey stars as Kim Baker a network news desk jockey who seizes the opportunity to report from Afghanistan in 2004 but comes to the field with little experience. Her naivete lands her in immediate trouble -- if she knew the language she would have understood a woman screaming ""Cover yourself you shameless whore"" for not covering her head -- but Fahim (Christopher Abbott) her interpreter and fixer patiently steers her in the right direction. She gets help too from Col. Hollanek (a terrific Billy Bob Thornton) a cantankerous Marine who protects her as an embedded reporter and offers up a colorful array of unprintable quotes. What was originally supposed to be a three-month stint turns into something closer to three years and as Kim establishes solid contacts on the ground including a highly placed Afghan official (Alfred Molina) the downtime ensnares her in the rowdy frat-house culture of other press embeds. She gravitates toward the glamorous and aggressive reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) one of her few female colleagues and soaks in the party atmosphere of hookahs and hookups leading to a relationship with Iain (Martin Freeman) a roguish photographer from Scotland. But as the years drag on and the American public loses interest her scoops get ignored and her presence in Afghanistan becomes red ink on the ledger. Any one of these angles is compelling in isolation The surreal disconnect between journalists quarters and the streets of Kabul suggests a cultural gap that reporters can never bridge despite their best efforts. The relationship between Kim and Tanya when considered alongside their reporting in Kabul and the much more restrictive Kandahar reveals a broad spectrum of women trying leverage power in male-dominated worlds. And theres satire and tragedy in the truth that the same media that amplified the U.S. governments case for war in Afghanistan find their interest waning once it turns into a quagmire. At its best Whiskey Tango Foxtrot turns Kabul into a purgatorial no mans land for American reporters and troops who are stranded in a war zone without a mission or an exit strategy. But that creeping apathy infects the film too which is never as sharp as it needs to be. Carlock and Fey cant fall back into their old 30 Rock rhythms lest they turn Kim into too much of a self-deprecating bungler and undermine her professional bona fides. And the busyness of the films agenda leaves several subplots undernourished particularly the casual ""Kabubble"" romance between Fey and Freeman which bleeds into search-and-rescue action climax that strains credulity. Then again credulity is already strained past the breaking point by casting Abbott and Molina two conspicuously non-Middle Eastern actors in the two most prominent Afghan roles. Abbott and Molina are brilliant performers and at least a glimmer of the sensitivity and emotion of Abbotts beautiful turn in last years James White is on display here. But in the year 2016 as Hollywoods struggles with diversity have come under increasing scrutiny the casting not only strikes a sour note in the culture but actively harms the films mission. If audiences are to believe that Whiskey Tango Foxtrot reveals the true face of our misadventures in Afghanistan it has to better reflect the faces of those who are there.

Simon Houpt The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 04 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 04 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Written by Robert Carlock Starring Tina Fey Classification 14A Year 2016 Country USA Language English In military terms the fog of war is a cloud of confusion that descends on the battlefield preventing fighters from clearly seeing their targets. There is also a fog of filmmaking and it appears to have affected those responsible for Whiskey Tango Foxtrot a war-set comedy-drama as messy and ineffective as an Afghan suicide donkey. Tina Fey and Margot Robbie dish on Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (AP Video) The absurdity of an explosives-laden ass alas doesnt make the leap from the pages of The Taliban Shuffle Kim Barkers 2011 memoir as a newbie war correspondent to the film screen; but then neither does most of the rich absurdity she chronicled. Instead we get familiar Tina Fey blowing up her desk-jockey life to become a TV reporter and watch things blow up on the other side of the world.Veteran showrunner Robert Carlock has written sharp female-centred TV comedies before (30 Rock Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) but they depended on a quirky hothouse rhythm that seems to have escaped the grasp of co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. The dialogue is sour the politics problematic (Broadway veterans as Afghan locals? Why not?) and the sentiments sometimes eye-rolling. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot indeed.

She dives head first into the world of embedded reports and finds the rush of war to be its own intoxicating drug and winds up chasing the next big high.At her home base she forms a family unit with fellow reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) a Scottish photographer (Martin Freeman dropping the nerd guise and playing a convincing cad) and her aide Fahim Ahmadzai (""James Whites"" Christopher Abbott in yet another promising performance).Billy Bob Thornton also is on board as a stern Marine colonel as is Alfred Molina as an Afghanistan government official who wants to get to know Barker on a very personal level.But its Barkers story and Fey delivers a strong performance that calls on her dramatic chops more than her comedic skills. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is mis-marketed as a comedy; while its got some fish-out-of-water and learning curve laughs its mostly about Barker navigating her new surroundings and figuring out her station in life. She and her fellow reporters are in what the movie refers to as the ""Kabubble"" -- the holding pattern in Kabul where even though theyre constantly in harms way theyre safe from the outside world and particularly their lives back home. Theyre all there to escape something.Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who made last years con caper ""Focus"" (also with Robbie) and 2011s overstuffed ""Crazy Stupid Love"" bring Barkers true story to spry life. (The screenplay is based on Barkers book ""The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan."") The movie is apolitical mentioning the war in Afghanistan only as a ""forgotten war"" and a ratings dud and deals more with the cultural aspects of an American living in the Middle East. (New Mexico convincingly stands in for Afghanistan.)Fey going through the motions in Decembers comic loser ""Sisters"" finds her groove here. Its her most significant film role yet; to date her screen work has mostly been in movies that partner her with friends (Amy Poehler in ""Sisters"" and ""Baby Mama"" Steve Carell in ""Date Night"") or in small roles (as the teacher in ""Mean Girls"" a prison guard in ""Muppets Most Wanted"" and a member of a large ensemble in ""This Is Where I Leave You"").Yet shes one of the most respected talents in Hollywood due mostly to the years she spent on ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""30 Rock"" properties in which she was intimately involved on the writing side. She hasnt connected as well to projects she didnt pen but ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" alters that trajectory.Thats in large part due to her nonglamorous every-woman persona We believe in her because we can relate to her whether shes playing a character in a TV studio or on the front lines of war. Here shes taking on a lot of heft but she pulls it off. Shes worth following into battle.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaWhiskey Tango FoxtrotGRADE BRated R for pervasive language some sexual content drug use and violent war imagesRunning time 111 minutes 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1oTGWUL TOP VIDEOS Oakland County Sheriff car chase052East Detroit Schools CEO superintendent ready to work together333Trump denies he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton emails035Donald Trump discusses pulling out of NAFTA tariff for Ford123Zoom Gas Station029Surveillance video of breaking and entering029Highland Park eco village brings basics back to Avalon Street2572016 Festival of Chariots parade154Debbie Dingell adresses unity town hall meeting118World Peace mural135 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/adam-graham/2016/03/03/movie-review-tina-fey-goes-war-whiskey-tango-foxtrot/81300902/,200,whiskeytangofoxtrot8,whiskeytangofoxtrot,detroitnews

Apparently someone else noticed too. And so now we have its movie adaptation ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" in which Barker has literally become a Tina Fey character a slightly kvetchy TV producer named Baker who leaves Manhattan to find awkward social moments and fashion disasters in Kabul. Also bloody bombings. Theres certainly room for a pitch-black comedy about our never-ending war on terror and one spiced with bitter observations on modern media. Unfortunately there still is. Given the chance to do an Afghani ""MASH"" ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" settles for a middling ""30 Rock the Kasbah."" Its a bit surprising because Fey is a sharp writer and the directing team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa previously made the bouncy ""Focus"" and punchy - if oddly punctuated - ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Except they and Fey didnt write this one. A long-time scripter for her ""30 Rock"" show (and ""Saturday Night Live"") did. And while thats understandable - Fey produced this project and certainly wanted collaborators who knew her comfort level - dont the best comedies trade a little in discomfort? In daring? Instead even with its occasional shifts between high-tension drama and slightly snarky comedy this movie (like Sandra Bullocks similarly de-fanged political satire ""Our Brand Is Crisis"") plays it safe. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" - the title is radio-speak for a certain rude acronym as well as confusingly the title of a different unrelated war memoir by Ashley Gilbertson - starts in 2003. Strapped for resources a national TV network has no other choice but to send Feys unprepared Baker to Afghanistan to cover the U.S. occupation. Its a sharp learning curve. Leaving behind her cushy New York desk job Baker suddenly has to navigate a place where no devout man will come near her no government official will talk to her and every night is interrupted by blackouts and bullets. Oh and the network wants hot stories and lots of them. Eventually Baker settles in and so to be fair does the movie. Billy Bob Thornton equipped with another improbable hairpiece is fun as a grimly unimpressed Marine officer; Margot Robbie discovers an inner edge as a celebrity journalist and Martin Freeman and Alfred Molina add smiles as a drunken Scots photographer and a flirtatious Afghan official. There are also some nice rare human moments with Christopher Abbott as Bakers translator the shy and genuinely religious Fahim - although the scripts plea for understanding and tolerance might carry more weight if the film actually cast some of its Arab and Afghan characters with Arab and Afghan actors. Frankly if unfairly it also might have a little more heft if it starred someone besides the woman who put this project in motion. Fey is a very winning performer and lately - ""This Is Where I Leave You"" ""Admission"" - shes tried to add some drama to her comic roles. But its too little here. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" cries out for at least one hugely dramatic scene - one in which we not only believe this persons become a great reporter but understand the toll the war has taken on her - yet the film never really goes there. (Even the kidnapping of a friend is played out with heavy-handed irony to a lilting pop song.) And while some of the jokes are fine - particularly the films knowing take on the dont-ask dont-tell adulteries of far-flung correspondents - it too often targets Fey for mildly patronizing putdowns. Why cant the humor come from her being super-competent like Holly Hunter in ""Broadcast News""? Why does it have to come from an idea of women as disorganized devious (and of course lousy drivers)? Fey has her moments and so does ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" But for a performer who still deserves some big-screen respect her war-movie comedy still feels a little small-screen a little timid a little safe. Its as if shes so worried about whether or not well still like her shes forgetting what it is we truly love. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations brief nudity strong language violence and substance abuse. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (R) Paramount (111 min.) Directed by Glenn Ficarra John Requa.

Slideshow Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Bored journalist experiences life during wartime Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Whiskey Tango Foxtrot >> So shes taking a risk in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot her first lead role in a semi-drama. She took a risk last year too playing against type in Sisters in which she was the loud daring sibling opposite best friend/soul mate Amy Poehlers staid boring sis. Fey seemed miscast in Sisters. But she fits right into Whiskey Tango Foxtrot playing first-time war correspondent Kim Baker who makes the rash decision to leave a staid life in New York for a post in Afghanistan in the early 2000s. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is based on the memoir The Taliban Shuffle by former Chicago Tribune South Asia bureau chief Kim Barker. (One letter has been removed for the fictional Kims name.) The role is not that much of a stretch for Fey at the fundamental character level. Her Kim Baker is sardonic and quick-witted funny and relatable. Essentially this is a woman who could be friends with Feys greatest creation Liz Lemon. Baker immediately regrets her decision to pack up and move away. Shes ignorant of the culture she has just embedded into and does not speak any language other than English let alone Pashto. But soon she gets hooked on the adrenaline of reporting from a war zone. She befriends gorgeous Brit correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie a woman who can make a correspondents uniform khakis and button-down shirt look chic and sexy) and starts a relationship with a roguish Scottish photographer (Martin Freeman). Fey does her best giving her character the dark humor thats reflected in Barkers memoir. But the script written by Robert Carlock Feys partner in crime from 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt never gives us a sense of who this woman really is or who any of the characters are beyond their thirst for the story. The movie lacks the emotional heft Fey can bring to a role. She did some excellent dramatic work in the flop This Is Where I Leave You so shes capable of working outside of her character type. Her Baker character also has this habit of saying that living in the ""Ka-bubble"" as the correspondents call their Kabul home is not normal that she wants to go back to the real world. It ignores the fact that for millions of Afghans this is normal this is the real world. They dont get to go back home. And most of them dont get the partying perks that Kim and her friends enjoy. But Fey is an inherently watchable actress and that makes the movie inherently watchable. Beyond its ""Liz Lemon in the desert"" jokes Whiskey Tango Foxtrot makes interesting points about Afghanistans ""forgotten war"" and how the media pay attention to foreign news. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot isnt a great movie but it is something rare and important a womans story of self-discovery - having nothing to do with her finding a husband - that has gotten room on the big screen. She takes a risk is independent and ultimately succeeds. meichelphillynews.com 215-854-5909mollyeichel Published March 4 2016 -- 105 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > HBO confirms end to Game of Thrones but spinoffs still possible Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

Credit Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures Based on Kim Barkers memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle"" ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" contains the fondly proudly recalled details of battle-tested experience. Kim -- last name ""Baker"" in the film -- goes from typing TV news in an office to a tour of duty as a journalist in war-ravaged Afghanistan. She dashes into a shootout to get video parries the clumsy advances of an Afghan government official and frequents the hormone-addled expat party scene.[ Read an interview with Tina Fey ]Somewhere along the way she also finds herself and cracks a few jokes. Thats not entirely unexpected because Kim is played by Tina Fey an old hand at portraying the self-deprecating nerdy workaholic getting a handle on her personal life. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" suggests a serious extension of Ms. Feys best-known comedic persona on more treacherous terrain and with an Afghan culture clash. Instead of walking the absurdist halls of ""30 Rock"" Ms. Feys character is sucked into the grueling but addictive pursuit of war journalism. Video Movie Review Whiskey Tango Foxtrot The Times critic Nicolas Rapold reviews ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date March 3 2016. Photo by Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed Kim embeds with the military to chase stories half-reluctantly hooks up with a foul-mouthed British journalist (Martin Freeman) and generally gets her groove back. Bouncing on and offscreen like recurring TV characters are her protective traditional-minded young fixer Fahim (Christopher Abbott); her frenemy news colleague Tanya (Margot Robbie); and that goofily forward government official (Alfred Molina).As written by the TV veteran Robert Carlock Kims rise-and-fade arc is sympathetically rendered with humor and the urgency of an underhand pitch. The frazzled editing of Kims arrival in Kabul as a naif subsides early replaced by a narrative glide that hints self-knowledge will emerge from the chaos. Kims achievements are swiftly packaged as personal wins such as when she proves her savvy to a top Marine officer (Billy Bob Thornton) shes reporting on.To an extent the films shortfalls feel bound up with high expectations for Ms. Fey. As Kim she wants to show how the risky search for scoops in Kabul feeds something within her without really sustaining her. But somehow the effort translates into this talented performer holding back a little too much losing the expressive verve that firing on all pistons as a comic seems to give her. It also doesnt help that Ms. Feys sharpest past work has simultaneously skewered the archetype of the neurotic single professional and complicated it with a self-conscious edge that this film could use.

(The Afghan setting streamlines the book; Ms. Barker now an investigative reporter for The New York Times also went to Pakistan.) But the films directors arent as sure-footed as they were with the manias of ""I Love You Phillip Morris."" The Afghan portrayals bend between affectionate understanding and cheap shots. Some of the films shorthand reflects the cut-to-the-chase caricature of someone forced to adapt to frequently hostile surroundings (in which Kim is harassed as an independent woman in the streets). But the film also rests in a tidiness thats at odds with the messiness of the milieu. And even when we are exposed to glimpses of wartime violence and menace its undercut by fuzzy platitudes near the end of the film. Ms. Barker seems to have earned the reward of such a reassuring conclusion but its not clear the movie has.""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language sexual content drug use and images of war.

Cut to 2016 and ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" an adaptation of Barkers book starring ... Tina Fey. The main characters name has been changed from Kim Barker to Kim Baker. Other than that ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a scene-by-scene note-for-note 100 percent faithful adaptation of the book. KIDDING. As is the case with nearly every transition from non-fiction book to fictional movie the changes are vast and varied from turning Kim Baker into a TV reporter to eliminating the Pakistan element (and hence the ""Taliban Shuffle"" a term used to describe reporters constant shuttling between the two war zones) to composite characters and wholly invented situations and drastically altered versions of scenes described in the book. RELATED Tina Fey talks about going to war in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" And yet somehow the essential truth and the overall tone of Barkers terrific book shine through thanks in large part to Tina Feys winning performance as the smart well-intentioned and initially naive Kim Baker who plunges into her assignment with great gusto and a resolve to change the world quickly learns she knows nothing sees firsthand the horrors of war -- and comes to think of Afghanistan as her home and her reality while New York and civilian life becomes a distant disconnected fantasy world. Though rated R for a steady stream of violence drug use sexuality and language ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" follows a conventional and familiar path as a fish-out-of-water tale with Feys Kim playing the enthusiastic well-meaning white woman who arrives in Kabul with a brand-new orange backpack only a passing knowledge of the local culture and the intricacies of the political machinations -- and no idea of how to comport herself as an embedded reporter. Kim encounters myriad archetypes in Kabul. Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast as the non-nonsense Gen. Hollanek who tells Kim he couldnt care less about her getting the story; he just wants to make sure she doesnt get any of his men killed. Alfred Molina chews up the screen as a corrupt Afghanistan official who has a thing for Kim. (In one of the films best scenes Kim fends off his advances with an angry but hilarious outburst. Its a fine piece of acting from Fey who knows as well as anyone how to deliver a zinger but also conveys a real sense of anger mixed in with a little bit of genuine fear during the confrontation.) Martin Freeman is the rogue/good-guy Scottish photographer who falls for Kim. Margot Robbie is a sharp-tongued hoot as Tanya a gorgeous and well-respected international correspondent who bluntly tells Kim shes gone from like a five or a six (on a scale of 1-10) in New York to an eight in Kabul. Christopher Abbott is a standout as Kims handler and interpreter Fahim who becomes like a brother to her and helps Kim see theres so much more to Afghanistan and its people than the nearly ceaseless sights and sounds of guns firing bombs going off and loved ones mourning. The script by Robert Carlock (a longtime collaborator of Feys) features some smart dialogue and a few legit moments of drama and peril though a few really bright characters do some really dumb things in the interest of creating dramatic tension. Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who previously teamed up for ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""Focus"") do a credible job of turning New Mexico into Afghanistan. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is also to be commended for not turning every Middle Eastern character into a stereotype. The politician played by Molina and the handler/interpreter played by Abbott arent mere caricatures. (Billy Bob Thorntons general on the other hand is ALL caricature but Billy Bob knows who to make a role like that sing.) Fey is such a likable and funny screen presence but shes no lightweight when it comes to playing subtle honest drama e.g. a scene where Kim is stateside and she visits a wounded soldier who might have been put in harms way because of her reporting. If this role isnt remembered as THE signature moment when we came to think of Tina Fey as an award-level dramatic actor as well as an iconic comic force its a substantial step in that direction.  Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Robert Carlock. Running time 111 minutes. Rated R (for pervasive language some sexual content drug use and violent war images). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Photo Credit Paramount Pictures and Broadway / Frank Masi advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A deskbound journalist volunteers to report on the Afghanistan War.CAST Tina Fey Martin Freeman Margot RobbieRATED R (language suggestive sexuality some violence)LENGTH 152BOTTOM LINE A scattered comedy-drama with few laughs and even fewer insights. War is hell but the parties are killer in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" starring Tina Fey as a deskbound journalist who throws caution to the wind and volunteers to report on the war in Afghanistan. Based on Kim Barkers 2011 memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle"" the movie presents the stories of two crises -- one personal one international -- but both get superficial treatment. A New York Times review of Barkers book noted ""She depicts herself as a sort of Tina Fey character"" and lo it has come to pass in the film version. Baker (no longer Barker oddly) is a perfect role for Fey who excels at playing the intelligent ambitious attractive everywoman. On the hottie scale Baker may be a 6 in New York but shes a rare 9 in Kabul says Tanya Vanderpoel a stunning blond anchor played by Margot Robbie. Fey reacts to this with an expression of dignified humiliation; her beleaguered persona remains endearing even as the movie tests our patience. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" spells out a salty acronym that signifies general bafflement. Thats Bakers default mode as she attempts to navigate Afghanistans restrictive culture her colleagues permissive sexuality and the unwanted advances of eccentric power broker Ali Massoud Sadiq (an excellent Alfred Molina). Billy Bob Thornton is enjoyable as a Marine colonel whose attempts to help the locals almost literally blow up in his face. Vignettes and observations can carry a memoir but they dont add up to a movie-quality narrative. Robert Carlocks script tries to compensate by linking several small subplots. One involves a lukewarm romance with Scottish photographer Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman miscast as a hard-drinking womanizer). Elsewhere Baker faces various moral dilemmas and dire emergencies that feel contrived. Only Bakers friendship with her dedicated fixer Fahim (Christopher Abbott) strikes a note of genuine emotion. Directed in a scattershot style by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and co-produced by Lorne Michaels ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" treats the Afghanistan War with a level of sensitivity but offers no new insights. Nor does it make us care much about Baker. ""Thats the most American-white-lady story Ive ever heard"" one character tells her and its hard not to agree.

Itas not so much bad as dismayingly bland. 192 Shares Share 170 Tweet 20 Share 2 Share Email Print Share Tina Fey in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Photo Paramount Pictures The war sort-of comedy Whiskey Tango Foxtrot stars Tina Fey as an Afghanistan-based news correspondent which means that if nothing else she now has more foreign-policy experience than Sarah Palin. Damn I hoped it would be great -- harsher and ""sicker"" (in the Terry Southern National Lampoon sense) than all the over-earnest War on Terror films of the last decade. Behind the camera are Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Saturday Night Live and gonzo-comedy vets writer Robert Carlock co-producer Lorne Michaels and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote Bad Santa. The source material is Chicago Tribune South Asian bureau chief Kim Barkers barbed memoirA The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There was the potential here for another MASH (Robert Altmans movie not the aggressively humanistic TV series). A I know what youre thinking ""Dream on."" Maybe that kind of movie would be made for premium cable or Netflix or Amazon these days but Whiskey Tango Foxtrot turns out to be a weak broth. I was rooting for it so hard that I told myself I liked it even as it missed one mark after another. But in the end its just shapeless and apolitical. Well there is a watered-down feminist message if thats your idea of political. Feys Kim Baker -- the loss of an ""r"" from Bakers name strikes me as symbolic as if the writer were telling us the jokes would be more family-friendly -- is now a lifestyle-news TV producer instead of a newspaper reporter. Shes tapped for Afghanistan because the big-deal correspondents have moved on to Iraq and because shes single and without kids. Pretty humiliating right? When she arrives in Afghanistan shes doesnt know the language so she cant hear the Afghans ridicule. Shes also a klutz. And shes quickly reminded of her not-hotness -- the movies view not mine -- by the presence of a conventionally gorgeous Aussie blonde TV reporter played by Margot Robbie. Still Baker is told a ""4"" or ""6"" at home is given the paucity of Western women a ""10"" in Afghanistan. I have a female colleague who gets annoyed that Fey seems to go out of her way in her movies to deride her looks as if she werent such an attractive woman. So the movie makes hay out of the way an Afghan government official (Alfred Molina) whose job is to crusade against alcohol and immorality constantly puts the moves on her. Presumably for commercial reasons Whiskey Tango Foxtrot needs a love story so Martin Freeman turns up as a Scottish photographer who starts out sleazy and evolves into a puppy dog. Hes adorable but by the time he starts talking about getting serious the helium has gone out of the movie. You might have winced when you read that Molina plays an Afghan official. You might again when you read that Christopher Abbott -- best known from Girls but revelatory in last years film James WhiteA -- is Bakers fixer and translator Fahim. So its another movie in which non-Westerners are played by Americans and Brits with ruddy makeup. For the record Molina is amusing and Abbott on his own terms entirely credible. But the response on social media has been justly fierce. Doesnt Hollywood ever learn? Reading Barkers book I was struck by how incisive it is and how the carnage is not just tragic but the product of chaos and misdirection. Its packed with episodes that would have been startling onscreen and with crazy-scary characters whod have burned a hole in the screen. Barkers descriptions of U.S.-endorsed president Hamid Karzai and his murderous corrupt family are brutal. But Karzai isnt in the movie and criticism of how the occupation is being managed is confined to exasperated looks by a general (Billy Bob Thornton whos superbly caustic). The only real criticism is reserved for higher-ups at Bakers TV network who dont think Americans care about the day-to-day outrages of life in Afghanistan. That seems rather hypocritical given how much is left out of this movie I liked watching Fey whos learning to be a real actress -- to stop pulling sitcom faces and just be. Its fun to watch her go from helpless to hard-charging mastering the language and trying to see past the propaganda on all sides. But the part isnt filled in and the movie has a huge omission When Baker announces that she has gotten too used to the madness of Afghanistan -- that shes worried its starting to seem too normalA -- the sentiment comes out of nowhere. Her dramatic arc like the films disintegrates. How did Whiskey Tango Foxtrot go wrong? My guess is in the usual way. The people holding the purse strings probably said that Americans dont like politics that theyd be offended by absurdist comedy when American soldiers are dying in Afghanistan and that the heroine had to be ""likable"" and meet a cute guy. Those calculations are in the name of selling more tickets in the multiplex but the odds are the movie will bomb anyway for having no distinct point of view. Its not so much bad as dismayingly bland. Its WTF for all the wrong reasons.

Photo Frank Masi MOVIE REVIEW Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Running time 111 minutes. Rated R (profanity sexuality drug use war violence). There arent enough movies in which Tina Fey fires an AK-47 while grinning maniacally. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" turns out to make excellent use of her established skills while revealing new ones Its ""30 Rock Me to the Casbah."" Episodic loose and observational ""WTF"" is more a magazine article than a movie -- its based on a memoir by a war correspondent who spent several years in and around Kabul Afghanistan -- but its brilliantly told. Its funny odd and endearing as drenched with detail as Afghanistan is with craziness (typified by the Islamist fanatics who are seen ""executing"" old TV sets by shooting them). Fey plays Kim Baker a bored TV producer (the real Kim was then a Chicago Tribune reporter) who volunteers to become an embed in Kabul. Immediately she loses an envelope full of money at the airport and spends a TV interview being blinded by her own hair as it whips around her face in the wind. A friendly but hard-charging general (Billy Bob Thornton wearing a mustache that makes him look more like a member of the Eagles than a Marine) introduces her to the 4-10-4 rule Ladyfolk who might be rated a 4 back home seem like 10s to the men starved for female companionship but then revert to being 4s upon returning home. Turning to a comely fellow war reporter (Margot Robbie) Kim says ""What are you like a 15?"" Without playing up Feys tendency to whine and call it feminism the script by Feys longtime collaborator Robert Carlock makes it clear that war particularly in a Muslim country is a much more complicated experience for a woman. Peeing amid a crowd of men isnt an option but on the other hand Kim is welcomed by some village women for a secret chat in which they inform her that they not terrorists have been the ones blowing up the village wells built by the Marines. The women would rather walk to the river for water because its their only opportunity to share gossip. All of this is funny fresh and convincingly reality-based but it isnt until the second half that the movie begins to form a plot. Kim takes friendly fire from New York (a producer tells her that Afghanistan reports are starting to suffer from ""chronic same s - - t different-day-itis"") at the same time that she is liaising with an acerbic but kind-hearted Scottish photographer (a priceless Martin Freeman) who winds up with a very different war experience than the one for which he signed up. Directors John Requa and Glenn Ficarra (recovering from last years so-so ""Focus"") score the Scots big scene with Harry Nilssons light-rock classic ""Without You"" and its weirdly great. I dont expect the ""Deadpool"" audience to get this but Movies used to be about something besides fantasy and other movies. Its a vast interesting world out there that few writers bother to go out and bring back. ""Whiskey Tango"" isnt just a sharp and engaging film. Its almost miraculous that it even exists.

Comments click to enlarge Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Video Rated R  111 minutes  2016 Based on a memoir by Kim Barker an American journalist who reported from post-9/11 Afghanistan and Pakistan this Tina Fey vehicle isnt as flippant as the acronym of its title might suggest. A fortysomething news writer in New York decides to shake up her humdrum life with a reporting assignment in Kabul that her boss has offered to the ""unmarried and childless"" in the office. Codirected by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Crazy Stupid Love) from a script by Robert Carlock (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) the movie mixes comedy set inside the hard-partying ""Kabulbubble"" as her adrenalized colleagues say with more solemn and occasionally frightening moments outside it. The casting can be racially insensitive such as Christopher Abbott playing a gentle Afghan bodyguard but the questions posed about journalistic ethics personal integrity and the problematic high of wartime reporting are all worth considering.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint For a dying industry journalism is getting very warm treatment in the movies lately. Days after ""Spotlight"" won the top Oscar Hollywood gives us the gritty quirky and unexpectedly touching ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" It is an exultantly good blend of fact fiction and laughs based on the 2011 memoir of Kim Barker the former south Asia bureau war reporter for the Chicago Tribune. The film follows her initially naive and increasingly gutsy five-year tour of battle-torn Afghanistan and Pakistan. Tina Fey the films producer and star keeps getting better and better in each of those positions. Here she hits a new high mark in both. Barker is re-imagined as a TV network correspondent -- lets admit it newspaper typing is not cinema gold -- facing a turning point. Deciding to leave behind a humdrum office assignment and monotonous relationship she declares war on her own dull safe life. Taking a transformative risk she signs on as correspondent in Kabul where she cant speak the languages (at first) travel without protective male guards or go in public without a headscarf or blue Pashtun burqa. As Barker notes ""you like your women to be beautiful mysterious Ikea bags."" Its actually a great choice quickly exciting for her and audiences too. Barker is a fish out of water but she quickly learns how to navigate the sands. The Marines helping to establish a sense of stability are oorah big brothers and the yammering power structure in Kabuls government ""Kabubble"" spouts gibberish too bizarre to ignore. The journalists compound is an Animal House for libidinous dance party booze-ups an antidote to the bleakness of the conflict. Its the assignment of a lifetime provided you dont detonate a booby-trapped roadside bomb. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language some sexual content drug use and violent war images. The film is shrewdly written by Robert Garlock Feys collaborator on her excellent TV shows ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" and ""30 Rock."" This is a movie where women play the lead and key supporting roles but its not a womens picture. Like ""The Big Short"" its part whimsy part quasi-documentary. It gives Fey the first starring role that dares her to hold back her trademark sassy humor balancing satiric comic relief with tough-minded honesty. Margot Robbie (fresh from ""The Big Short"") does parallel duty as Kims new frenemy a rival reporter who informs Barker that although she would rate a mediocre six in the New York dating pool shes a hot ""Kabul cute"" 10. The exotic culture and adrenaline rush has Barker all but addicted and more than a little cocky. But even the most enjoyable study-abroad program must end. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have grown beyond the manic nuttiness of their classic ""Bad Santa."" That films star Billy Bob Thornton brings a wonderful macho swagger to his role as a general stuck in a pointless war. Alfred Molina shines as a chuckling attorney general continually inviting Barker to become his very special friend and Christopher Abbott brings charm and depth to the role of her translator chauffeur and protective problem-solver. Each role is amusing without becoming lightweight. Things go boom frequently in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" a film where most of the punch lines hurt. Its a bloody funny movie and a funny bloody movie.

(Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures and Broadway Video/Little Stranger Productions via AP) Kim Baker (Tina Fey) has the misfortune of being just the kind of journalist that her television network determines should be sent to Afghanistan single and childless. Next thing she knows shes in Kabul -- called ""Kabubble"" by her peers in the field who spend their time pursuing stories partying hard and hoping that theyll get to the end of another day without being shot blown up or taken hostage.Among them is the upbeat and ultra-sexy Tanya (Margot Robbie) who joyously informs Kim that American women in Afghanistan are immediately considered significantly more attractive than they were back home. Tanya also asks for and is granted permission to get intimate with Kims security team. And indeed sex is definitely in the air Gen. Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) warns Kim to keep her hands off his troops. Also on the scene is Iain (Martin Freeman) a photographer with whom Kim establishes the kind of prickly yet provocative chemistry that can only mean theyll soon be engaged in something other than conversation.Kim had never thought of herself as a war correspondent before landing in Afghanistan. But who knows? It might turn out to be a good career move. Loosely based on a memoir by similarly named journalist Kim Barker ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (consider those initials) clearly wants to be a satirical war story in the tradition of ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" but winds up as little more than a superficial fish-out-of-water romp. Working from a screenplay by Robert Carlock (""30 Rock"") co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""Crazy Stupid Love"") deliver a film that couldnt be less interested in the complexities of the situation its allegedly depicting. Kim is just another clueless American minimally concerned about geopolitical realities. Granted Fey is inspired casting. But her performance is about as nuanced as a landmine explosion.Theres a sharp comedy to be made about Americas misadventures in Afghanistan.

"Tina Feys Smashing Turn as a Serious Actress in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Tina Feys Smashing Turn as a Serious Actress in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot By Rex Reed  03/03/16 1134am Tina Fey and Billy Bob n Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Except for her famous funny spot-on sendup of the ridiculous Sarah Palin Tina Feys comedy talents have always eluded me. But in an effort to become a bona fide movie star so steeped in desperation that it has left her with a sweaty brow she has finally hit pay dirt with something called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. The absurd title which misleads you into thinking its a frivolous comedy has nothing to do with the film which is a fearsomely vivid depiction of the life and career of investigative reporter and war correspondent Kim Barker who left a lucrative job as a New York writer in 2003 to cover the war in Afghanistan. The movie doesnt know if it wants to be a hard-hitting drama about the pitfalls facing the media that tried to sell an unpopular war to the weary grieving public following 9/11 or a romantic movie about a disillusioned lady journalist in harms way who found empowerment on the front lines surrounded by the Taliban. The choice it makes with mixed (but mostly strong and positive) results is to be a little of both. I found it flawed but fascinating and a no-fail showcase for Tina Feys real talents as a serious actress. Best of all this movie is never boring for a single minute. WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT  (3/4 stars) Written by Robert Carlock Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Starring Tina Fey Margot Robbie and Martin Freeman Running time 112 min. Based on the real Kim Barkers memoir The Taliban Shuffle the screenplay by Robert Carlock for some mysterious reason changes her name to a fictitious Kim Baker. In the film shes an unhappy unfulfilled woman who volunteers for a dangerous assignment in Kabul to escape from a wimpy ineffectual boyfriend. A poor reason to risk your life and look death and destruction in the eye if you ask me but once she arrives in the dirt and danger she hits the ground running under the guidance of the slick directing duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who turned I Love You Philip Morris and Crazy Stupid Love into cinematic keepers. The collision between a privileged white Western female with balls and the oppressed tortured and second-class Afghan women furnishes Kim with human-interest features but the new producer back home (Cherry Jones) cuts back her air time to favor her best friend rival reporter Tanya (Margot Robbie) who betrays her to get a grittier story. In the course of making her mark she interviews warlords the first woman bus driver in Kabul and fights off seduction by the Afghan attorney general (a miscast Alfred Molina). Breaking rules defying orders and watching her colleagues die she also loses her boyfriend (Josh Charles) dodges bullets narrowly escapes death in a disco bombing befriends a tough Marine colonel (a silver-haired Billy Bob Thornton living up to his vow to look different in every film) and sleeps with and reluctantly falls for a crude charming and roguish Scottish war photographer played by Martin Freeman a dashing actor from the U.K. who steals the movie. We get a close look at the sordid living conditions and personal relationships of journalists who will do anything to crack a story while learning a whole new terminology about war at the front (a ""wet hooch"" is a coveted tent with a shower). They lie cheat sabotage and betray each other to get a scoop home to American viewers who have already lost interest in Afghanistan which by 2006 was labeled ""the forgotten war."" The rewards are small but the personal and political lessons Kim learns are life changing while Tina Feys growth as an actress is even greater.

(Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures) Between the misfire that was ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" and the unalloyed disaster of ""Rock the Kasbah"" it hasnt been a particularly edifying period for fish-out-of-water stories featuring funny Americans bumbling their way to self-actualization in exotic war-torn locales. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" an amenable easygoing version of the story starring Tina Fey is the least objectionable of the bunch though it falls prey to some similarly regrettable assumptions. Adapted from journalist Kim Barkers 2011 memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle"" which recounted her experiences reporting from Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Chicago Tribune this plunge into the adrenaline-fueled world of war reporting winds up being surprisingly winning and low-key giving Fey a welcome chance to dial down the gag-centric humor that defines most of her comedy work and to deliver a warm understated portrayal of a woman whos more rueful and self-aware than zanily madcap. [Tina Fey and Kim Barker talk about taking the book to the screen] Kim Baker (a ""r"" has been dropped to maximize creative license) arrives in Afghanistan in 2003 having hit the wall professionally as a network news writer and seeking adventure and change. Shes given a room in a Kabul apartment building known as the ""Fun House"" a den of iniquity thats part frat house part forward operating base. Among her instant friends include a Lara Logan-esque TV journalist named Tanya (Margot Robbie) a dashing Scottish photographer named Ian (Martin Freeman) and Bakers ""fixer"" a quietly observant local named Fahim. Looking to mix up her mundane life journalist Kim Barker (Tina Fey) moves to Afghanistan to work as a war correspondent. (  / Paramount Pictures) The fact that Fahim is played by American actor Christopher Abbott -- and a Kabul politician is played by British actor Alfred Molina -- is no less tone deaf for the fact that both men deliver sensitive funny performances. The sight of white actors donning beards and Afghan pakols to depict ""foreign"" characters is wincingly off-putting as is the tendency of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" to present Afghanistan as a dusty chaotic backdrop for its heroines personal catharsis. (The correspondents clique is constantly referred to as the ""Kabubble."") At one point Kim refers to ""the real world"" as if Afghanistan was somehow a piquant detour which might capture her own journey into the hothouse atmosphere of war reporting but also speaks volumes about the films own solipsism. [Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and Hollywoods enduring problem with whitewashing] Still considering the films own ""Kabubble"" mindset Fey and her directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa find real emotion in the characters journey which includes a brief very believable love affair and a growing friendship with Fahim that results in an affectingly choreographed encounter toward the films end. (Billy Bob Thornton also deserves credit for his delightful cameo as a gruff Marine general.) Baker even has a gratifying moment of reckoning during which one of the first soldiers she interviews on her beat delivers a moving speech about getting over self-pity and moving on. As evidenced in such past films as ""I Love You Philip Morris"" and ""Crazy Stupid Love"" Ficarra and Requa like tonally off-kilter films that dont fit comfortably into ready-made genres. True to that ethos ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" possesses plenty of laid-back humor flawlessly delivered by Fey but its wry tone and pathos keep it from being an out-and-out comedy. Thats the strength of a film that at its best captures the dizzyingly contradictory feelings of attraction and horror toward the life-and-death stakes of war and of feeling both at home and at sea in a cacophonous confounding world. True to its title as well as its flawed but sympathetic protagonist ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is more confused than cynical or opportunistic. Its bewilderment is contagious and ultimately endearing.

Amy Nicholson 03/03/2016 TheAmyNicholson Whiskey Tango Foxtrot -- yes youre supposed to chop that into initials -- is a girl-power comedy with a bold twist The timid heroine blossoms in Afghanistan one of the most female-unfriendly countries on earth. By day Kim Baker (Tina Fey) a TV reporter and her male team visit all-girls schools that have been torched by the Taliban who burned desks and books and scrawled ""No education for women"" on the wall. Outdoors men and women cant even touch. But at night inside their Kabul dorm a.k.a. the Kabubble the journalists get wasted and screw acting out like college freshmen celebrating their freedom. Its oppression versus decadence. Both groups are extremists -- the foreigners are just having a lot more fun. Back in America Kim was a wallflower hunched over her desk picking at a Tupperware of chicken salad. In Afghanistan she glows. Here where male expats outnumber women 30 to 1 shes a ""serious piece of ass."" When she struts into a party with fellow reporter Tanya (Margot Robbie) a macho blonde who chews toothpicks every man drools. [Note Paramount which produced Whiskey Tango Foxtrot and MTV News are both owned by Viacom.] Whats smart about Robert Carlocks script based on the memoir The Taliban Shuffle by former Chicago Tribune reporter Kim Barker (Feys character just drops the first ""r"" in her last name) is that Kim notices shes a babe -- and doesnt care. Her suitors are lame the New Zealander bodyguard (Stephen Peacocke) with the cheesy shark tattoos the horndog Scottish freelance photographer (Martin Freeman) and even Afghanistans bear-chested minister of vice and virtue (Alfred Molina). (""That sounds like the Taliban"" presses Kim about Molinas position and hes so stunned by her guts that he falls in lust.) The guys assume Kim loves Kabul for the male attention. Sniffs one In Afghanistan shes a 10; at home shes a 4. But Kim is crushing on herself. She loves the woman shes become a brave hard-drinking badass who runs into gunfire clutching a camera. If she goes home that girl might vanish. Only her translator Fahim (Christopher Abbott quietly grounding the movie) recognizes the deeper truth Kim loves Kabul because shes addicted to danger a literal adrenaline junkie. Gotta admit directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Crazy Stupid Love Bad Santa) make Kabul look like a blast -- in every sense of the word. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot opens on a raging kegger cut short by a bomb. The reporters drop their drinks and grab their mics. Suck on that beer bong Walter Cronkite. This rowdy energy might seem flip. After all close to 100000 people have died in war in Afghanistan since 2001. Part of the seeming callousness might be attributed to the story taking place between 2003 and 2006 the calmest three-year stretch of the decade-long conflict when all the excitement (and TV coverage) was diverted to Iraq. In fact the Afghanistan of Barkers book was even more insensitive with fratty foreigners throwing theme parties like ""Tarts and Talibs."" Paramount PicturesBut back then -- just 10 years ago -- people blithely expected the War on Terror to end. At its most daring Whiskey Tango Foxtrot hints that Kim would rather it keep going. Shes not ready to leave despite the worldwide hangover to come -- and the daily hangovers that make her check for condom wrappers to know if she went home alone. So its welcome when Ficarra and Requa pop her Kabubble to let reality flood in. A sweet stroll during which she holds hands with a beau gets interrupted when a local woman calls her a whore. Colleagues get hurt. A driver drops her off at the wrong street and stranded after midnight the drunk and scarfless Kim sobers up fast. This city isnt really her friend. But the party keeps going and if we feel exhausted thats the point. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot wants us disoriented so that like Kim we forget how normal feels. When the film does get normal with a third-act romance its a drag. Were here to watch Tina Fey kick butt. Or really were here to watch Tina Fey period as she follows in the footsteps of her SNL co-star Kristen Wiig by tiptoeing toward serious roles. Kim is a smart choice for Feys next career stage. The role mimics her own life a writer who got ripped from her desk put in front of a camera and told to deliver the news. (Ten bucks says Fey snatched up Barkers book as soon as New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani described the author as ""sort of a Tina Fey character."") Screenwriter Carlock an SNL/30 Rock alum is a trustworthy hired gun who cautiously expands our idea of who Fey is and can be. This isnt Sarah Silverman jumping headlong into playing a depressed housewife in last falls I Smile Back. Carlock lets Fey get darker than weve ever seen -- and knows when to pull her back to get a laugh. (If only the Afghanistan war itself had been as well calculated.) Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is clever and complex enough to make you curious to see what Fey does next. Perhaps in 10 years Fey wont be hosting the Golden Globes -- shell be winning Best Actress.

"Tina Fey goes to war in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Tina Fey goes to war in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (R) An adaptation of Kim Barkers non-fiction account of the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com3/3/2016 Editor rating 2.5 ""I dont think I can do this"" Kim Barker (Tina Fey) tells her boyfriend early on in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Kim has good reason to be skeptical about her abilities. A writer she has spent her career working behind the scenes at a TV station and she has just left home to cover the war in Afghanistan. She has no on-air experience no particular understanding of the countrys politics and no clear idea of why she has volunteered for this mission except for a vague sense of dissatisfaction. Also theres fecal matter in the air. Who wouldnt want to go home?Based on the real-life Barkers memoir The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan Whiskey Tango Foxtrot follows her adventures in Afghanistan her growth as a journalist and her relationships with colleagues soldiers politicians and the fixer who helps her do her job. The film reimagines Barker a print journalist for the Chicago Tribune as a broadcast journalist for the obvious reason that video is sexier than type cinematically speaking. A print reporter doesnt leap out of a vehicle in the middle of a firefight between insurgents and Marines to shoot video. The film also cuts her stint in Pakistan presumably to improve its focus.The book plays a lot of Barkers adventures for laughs and in keeping with that spirit the film can be amusing. Many of its offbeat touches ring true -- because they are. Consider Egg Boy the kid who runs a scam on foreigners by crying on the street and pretending the eggs hes been carrying have been carelessly broken. Kim gives him money then is mad when she realizes shes been tricked. But her colleague gives the boy money anyway pointing out that whatever the truth is hes still begging in the street. Fey is a good fit with the material and her co-stars are all solid including Billy Bob Thornton as a laconic general; Martin Freeman as a boozy charming Scottish journalist; Alfred Molina as a local politician with a crush on Kim; and Christopher Abbott (Girls) as Kims fixer and translator (he tries to keep her out of trouble). Those last two characters are based on real people. The first two are not which may explain why both figure in the films most preposterous development an unthinkably silly rescue mission accomplished with minimal effort. If taking on the Taliban were this easy theyd be speaking Russian from Kabul to Kandahar.Directed by Glenn Ficara and John Requa (Focus Crazy Stupid Love I Love You Philip Morris) Whiskey Tango Foxtrot does present some of the chaos of the war but its simplistic explanations of complex relationships ultimately feel unsatisfying (like its view of foreign correspondents as mere adrenaline junkies when the truth may be a bit more complicated). This is a movie not about Afghanistan but about one Americans experiences there; Barkers book delves far deeper into the politics of the region. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is entertaining sometimes but if youre looking for any real insight youre looking in the wrong place. Cast Tina Fey Billy Bob Thornton Margot Robbie Martin Freeman Alfred Molina Christopher Abbott Josh Charles.Directors Glenn Ficara John Requa.Screenwriter Robert Carlock.

"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot review Tina Feys war correspondent a bit too glib - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Whiskey Tango Foxtrot review Tina Feys war correspondent a bit too glib Video Tina Fey in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Watch the trailer for Tina Feys ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" Watch the trailer for Tina Feys ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Tone means everything in comedy -- any kind of comedy. With a rollicking black comedy set in a war zone the tone necessarily goes plural as the story careens from the abruptly tragic to the blithely weirdly funny and back again.""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" learns this lesson the hard way and while its no disaster its oddly indistinct and uncertain. The film stars Tina Fey as a battle-untested TV news producer and writer thrown into the war correspondent game in Afghanistan in the middle of the last decade. Here and there the ""Crazy Stupid Love"" directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa capture the keyed-up camaraderie of its setting and the dislocating strangeness of what it must be like to drop into a U.S.-led conflict as a reporter inside the mess yet outside it. Alas most of the film settles for comic dithering and hoked-up romance under fire. Kim Barker What its like to have Tina Fey play you David Heinzmann Kim Barker was sitting at a restaurant table with a handful of old Chicago Tribune colleagues making fun of her eyelashes.

Kim Barker was sitting at a restaurant table with a handful of old Chicago Tribune colleagues making fun of her eyelashes. Nobody would have noticed but she pointed them out -- fake eyelashes. The former Tribune war correspondent who wrote ""The Taliban Shuffle"" a darkly comic memoir about living... (David Heinzmann) ""Guess Im a war reporter now"" Kim Baker tells her longtime boyfriend (Josh Charles) early in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" Once in Kabul Kim finds a patient reliable colleague in her local fixer Farouk (Christopher Abbott). The Western media covering the war in Afghanistan initially quiet and then increasingly bloody live in a ramshackle hostel of sorts. Kims pals include the hottest babe in country and Kims unofficial relationship coach Tanya (Margot Robbie who someday will play someone to be trusted even for a second); the oft-shirtless security officer Nic (aptly named Stephen Peacocke); and most importantly for the eventually single and available Kim the brash but sweet freelance photographer Iain (Martin Freeman). He loves the carousing high-adrenaline life hes living; it appeals to Kim as well up to a point.That point becomes the point of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" Shot largely in New Mexico doubling for Afghanistan the film written by Robert Carlock (Feys collaborator on ""30 Rock"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"") hinges on the incongruity of Baker in Kabul and beyond as she learns to cover the story and finesse interactions with the troops (Billy Bob Thornton plays another of her patriarchal protectors) as well as with the horndog Afghan prime minister (Alfred Molina).

A few things made the transfer from page to screen though a lot did not including Barkers time in Pakistan. The inventions are many; thats how it goes with adaptations; this is not a documentary. Whats missing is important though. In her memoir Barkers perspective and wit managed to keep the chronicle just this side of glibness. The movie exists on the other side. Everything that happens in Afghanistan is narratively engineered to make Feys character look good. Theres a cant-lose swagger to Feys performance here at odds with the role as written.You can sense it in the movies poster image which is also the cover shot for the reissued and retitled paperback edition of Barkers memoir. Theres Fey reporters notebook and pen in hand the other hand adjusting her sunglasses her hair tousled by the wind just so while a fireball lights up the background. Its almost a gag that photograph preening TV personality her back to the real story. But its not; its not meant to be funny. Its packaging the films obvious selling point. The film itself feels uncertain compromised and tentative. Those are very different qualities than brash or bracing or provocative.

This is a difficult film to describe and its easier to list all the things it isnt -- for example it isnt a spoof or a satire or a farce or a rom-com -- than defining what it is. In fact ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a surprisingly delicate creation especially for a studio movie built around a famous TV comedian. There are no Sarah Palin impressions or gratuitous ""30 Rock"" references to be found here and to the extent Paramount is trying to sell ""WTF"" as an ""SNL""-flavored laff-riot theyre doing its star a grave disservice. If anything it feels as if Fey is emulating the example of Kristen Wiig who has reconstructed her career with a series of disparate comic and dramatic film roles.So what is ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" you ask in exasperation? As Ted Cruz says 164 times a day thats a very good question and Im glad you asked. First of all its based on ""The Taliban Shuffle"" a memoir by journalist Kim Barker about her experiences as an ill-prepared war correspondent in Afghanistan and Pakistan. When Michiko Kakutani reviewed the book for the New York Times she described Barkers self-presentation as a zany Tina Fey-like character. Fey read that review and then read the book and got together with ""Saturday Night Live"" producer Lorne Michaels to acquire the rights and here we are Thats an entirely unlikely origin story for a movie but ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" has an air of care generosity and sincerity throughout that makes me believe its true.So in practice the resulting film in which Kim Barker the print journalist has become Kim Baker the TV journalist (because cameras are sexier than computers) is a character-based dramedy that leans more toward drama than comedy and almost never reaches for laugh lines. There are a few good chuckles but you wont rip out those hernia stitches and your hilarity-meter will remain unbusted. Its an unassuming feminist fable about an unexceptional ""American white lady"" (in Kims words) who reinvents her life and a somewhat realistic war film with notes of pathos and tragedy that seeks to avoid going too dark. Its ""Eat Pray Love"" meets ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in ""The Year of Living Dangerously.""I recognize that description may sound intriguing to some potential viewers and unbearable to others so let me hasten to add that the mixture of ingredients is always unstable. I was never bored by ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" and never felt sure where it was going next. As the marketing folks at Paramount know perfectly well those are not necessarily good things when it comes to selling a mass-market multiplex movie. Most Saturday night ticket-buyers specifically do not want to see something unconventional or unexpected; they want to see a story they already know told with a few new twists.On one level nothing could be more familiar than the tale of a mildly depressed middle-class woman who chucks it all away in her 40s and heads out in search of romance and adventure. But Feys deeply committed performance makes the uncertainty of Kims self-reinvention come alive; shes a real person trying to live through each moment as it comes. Kim is never quite sure why she makes the decisions she does and is only intermittently able to be the sardonic observer of her own life typically demanded by the post-""Bridget Jones"" genre. Credit also goes to screenwriter Robert Carlock whose adaptation of Barkers book evades all the usual cliches and even more to the oddball directing duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa whose films are good bad and weird in roughly equal proportion but always worth talking about. (They made ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor as con-man lovers the upside-down rom-com ""Crazy Stupid Love"" with Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell and more regrettably the campy Will Smith crime caper ""Focus."") You Might Also Like Once Kim finds herself in the ""Kabubble"" circa 2003 -- the tight-knit hard-partying circle of Western journalists spooks and private contractors conducting or covering the Afghan conflict -- she is surrounded by several stock characters but even those are memorably rendered. Margot Robbie plays the sexually voracious Aussie TV babe who assures Kim that even if shes no better than a 6 or 7 at home shes easily a ""Kabul 9."" Martin Freeman plays the lady-killing Scottish journalist who becomes Kims lover in a hilarious awkward and highly realistic sex scene (a Ficarra-Requa specialty). Billy Bob Thornton plays the hard-bitten Marine officer who comes to appreciate that Kim ""has got some."" Alfred Molina plays the jovial corrupt Afghan bureaucrat installed by the Americans who keeps trying to get into Kims knickers. Wait hang on -- what did I just say?Its fair to say that the representational politics of this situation are complicated Afghans are not Arab or Persian or South Asian; they come from diverse tribal and ethnic backgrounds and some of them have light skin and fair hair. But the fact that the two significant Afghan characters in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" are played by Molina who is British and Christopher Abbott who is American strikes me as at least a question mark in 2016. Yes both men are terrific actors and both are of Mediterranean ancestry; neither jumps out as inappropriate on-screen. Whatever artistic or business decisions may have been involved are invisible to us but I wonder whether the films directors and producers (i.e. Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels) even thought about this as a potential problem. The fact that Molinas character is a gross boorish caricature who seems out of whack with the movie around him doesnt help. Whether you view that issue as a crucial flaw or a minor footnote it points to the fact that ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a likable construction that points its star in a new direction without ever quite making a point. Theres a freshness and an unjaded quality to almost every scene that makes you want to keep watching and in the sudden eruptions of terrifying violence (sometimes set to schmaltzy 70s pop) you can feel Ficarra and Requa reaching for a little of Robert Altmans ""MASH"" and a little of Stanley Kubricks ""Full Metal Jacket."" I badly wanted this to be the wry antiwar comedy about Americas recent misadventures that no one has made and there are moments when it almost gets there. In the end the story of Kim Barkers reinvention has become the story of Tina Feys reinvention in a movie that has no obvious role to fill in the cultural economy. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Tina Fey as Kim Baker (left) and Margot Robbie as Tanya Vanderpoel in the strange intensity of combat reporting. Photo Frank Masi Associated Press Whiskey Tango Foxtrot War reportings horror strange appeal 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The big achievement of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is that it does two things simultaneously that would seem to be in contradiction. It presents life as a Western journalist in Afghanistan as horrible in every way -- dangerous ugly and miserable. And it also shows how that life could be attractive even addictive. Moreover it doesnt just tell you this it makes you feel it so that you end up envying people in one of the worst places on Earth. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is based on ""The Taliban Shuffle"" a memoir by Kim Barker who was the Chicago Tribunes South Asia bureau chief from 2004 to 2009. The movie changes things a bit. Here Tina Fey plays Kim Baker who is working as a copywriter for a TV network when she impulsively volunteers for the Afghanistan assignment. This little alteration of fact makes the character more of an innocent abroad while conveniently making her business less cerebral and more visual. She has a baptism by fire in an early scene. Working as an ""embed"" with the Marines shes part of a convoy thats attacked by insurgents. With machine gun bullets bouncing off the vehicle she nervously unbuckles her seat belt and the first thing we think is that she is about to panic. Instead she picks up a video camera jumps out of the truck and starts shooting the battle from inside the thick of it. This is an important moment and in several ways. First Fey persuades us to believe this woman would actually do that. Second its the moment that we realize that this is the story of an extraordinary person someone who might seem ordinary in most ways but has drives and impulses that can only be answered by this kind of mad environment. Third it signals that ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is not a comedy as we usually understand it. Its more like an unblinking presentation of absurdity on a mass scale. Robert Carlocks screenplay is impressive in what it doesnt say. No one ever mentions that the appeal of this life is intimately entwined with the possibility of being dead the next minute. Its just understood. Suddenly this woman is riding helicopters into war zones and we get it. This is not life as we usually know it with thoughts stuck in the past and anxieties about the future. This is nothing but now which makes life in the rickety hotel where Kim lives with other journalists a kind of middle-aged booze-soaked version of the last days of Pompeii. Like spring break with wrinkles. The story is a journey for Kim Baker but its one the audience has the experience of sharing. So we start as she does huddled in the hotel and hearing the sound of distant gunfire convinced this is a hellhole and wanting to escape. And we end up very soon feeling the addicts dilemma wondering if today is the day to stop or if one more high is worth the risk. Margot Robbie plays Tanya Kims best friend and professional rival and its a real asset to have someone with that kind of a star wattage in a supporting role. Shes utterly believable as a TV star but she fills in the characters undercurrents as well suggesting that there is something slightly wrong with her as though shes found a semi-healthy channel for a self-destructive impulse. Martin Freeman plays a roguish Scottish photographer and at first the role seems odd casting for an actor of Freemans sensitivity. Then it doesnt. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is by far Feys best movie. It makes use of her comic sense but also of her watchful wariness and underlying wistfulness. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have complete command of the movies tone and the screenplay never forces Fey into doing anything fake. There are none of the false conflicts and crises that you get in the last third of most comedies. In fact one of the best things about ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is that it has no particular climax at all. In place of a story with a classic structure we get an emotionally honest rendering of a episode something really interesting that happened in somebodys life. And so it feels real.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its unfair to compare any Tina Fey film project to her all-time-great TV show 30 Rock; thats like comparing a perfectly amusing episode of Saturday Night Live to Anchorman. But it may be equally difficult for any 30 Rock fan to watch Whiskey Tango Foxtrot without thinking of it as an alternate-world Liz Lemon prequel. Feys character Kim is a single New York City media worker (a writer of news copy rather than comedy sketches) who eventually acquires an irksome and persistent love interest played by Martin Freeman in a film written by 30 Rock mainstay Robert Carlock and produced by Fey and Lorne Michaels. The movie even ends in 2006 the year 30 Rock premiered.Kim isnt handed the reins of her own TV show; if anything she feels cut loose when she volunteers for an on-air reporting gig at her news network that involves relocating to Afghanistan for an extended period. The movie deposits her there in swift order leaving her motivations for later and its nicely jarring to see Fey starring in a movie with less of the studio sheen that glows sometimes too brightly from both her studio comedies and her occasional dramedies. (Whiskey isnt exactly an indie but on the scale of Paramount pictures with the Lorne Michaels name on them its pretty far afield from Mean Girls or Tommy Boy.) This is the grittiest and most mussed Fey has been on film and certain aspects of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot like the freedom and inventiveness with which she can swear are a fine extension of her comic persona.But co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa arent making the broadly comic version of this story; Fey and Carlocks self-effacing wit functions more as window-dressing arranged with restraint. Characters like photographer Iain MacKelpie (Freeman) fellow reporter Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) and Kims soft-spoken guide Fahim (Christopher Abbott from Girls and James White making an unexpected play for Ben Kingsley status) are relatively grounded. Fey has good chemistry with most of these actors and enough time with almost none of them. While only a few of those supporting players like local official Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina making a somewhat more expected play for Ben Kingsley status) are drawn with sketch-like exaggeration Kims embeds interviews and story-hunting nonetheless breeze by like little half-finished sketches never really detonating great jokes or pointed satire. Even at its best the dialogue moves slower than it ought to and the movies fun-house mirror of real-life craziness (based on the memoir The Taliban Shuffle) never equals the deadpan wonder that Ficarra and Requa brought to the similarly fact-based I Love You Phillip Morris.Theres lots of talk about how Kim is losing herself in the ""Ka-bubble"" (the particular and insulated life as a journalist in Kabul--wherein among other things she becomes a ""9.5"" in terms of attractiveness) but the movie only occasionally offers a glimpse of that heedless madness. Mostly it just throws to some debauched party scenes and cuts away too fast to really immerse the audience in them--never mind exposing them to more troubling situations in Afghanistan. By eliding some of these details the movie mirrors the very treatment of the war in Afghanistan that Kim and company complain about as its shunted aside in favor of Iraq. The irony does not appear intentional.There are plenty of engaging aspects to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot ideas about how reporters can become as acclimated as soldiers to the constant sometimes adrenalized rush of a modern-day forever-war; the fumbling romance between Kim and Iain (consistently punctuated with the sound of morning-after teeth-brushing); the friendly-until-its-not competition between Kim and Tanya (Fey and Robbie suggest they could do a snappy buddy comedy). But the filmmaking fails to draw this material together in a cohesive way and the resulting fragmentation feels more like a side effect than a skillful style choice. In the end Whiskey Tango Foxtrot plays like a slightly above-average version of the narrative where a single gal (or in the movies self-effacing parlance ""white lady"") finds herself--and even that business was better-handled (and tweaked with more specificity) on Feys TV show. A movie like this doesnt require 30 Rocks joke density or silly streak but its surprising that Fey and Carlocks satirical eyes arent a little more alert.

But Ficarra and Requa never quite strike a successful balance between comedy and drama making the whole thing feel a bit off.The film is based on ""The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days and Nights in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" a memoir written by print journalist Kim Barker. Here played by Fey she becomes Kim Baker a TV writer turned on-camera reporter when the network she works for wants volunteers for reporting in Afghanistan. Baker fits what seems to be the networks major criteria Shes single and childless (a description that reduces one would-be correspondent to tears).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A cable news producer (Tina Fey) takes on a daring new assignment in Afghanistan and finds herself in the middle of a chaotic war zone. Baker arrives in Afghanistan greeted by Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) a rival who nevertheless welcomes the presence of another woman in the testosterone-soaked environment. Baker is smart and curious but inexperienced which shows in tried-and-true ways like her bringing a bright orange bag to a combat zone.Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott) is Bakers local handler helping her navigate both the countrys geography and its customs. Ian MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) is a war photographer whose randy exterior masks you guessed it a softer side.The film offers few surprises. Thats not a deal breaker but an occasional curve would have been welcome.Fellow reporter Iain (Martin Freeman) provides some distraction to Kim (Tina Fey) in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)Crusty Gen. Hollanek  (Billy Bob Thornton) shows a great deal of patience with Baker recognizing the value of publicizing not just the fighting his troops are doing in the area but the building of wells schools etc. Baker quickly shows courage under fire and a knack for finding the personal touch in her stories. But there are challenges at every turn.Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina like Abbott a curious bit of casting) is a high-ranking official who would like a more personal relationship with Baker. Then theres the simple fact that she is a woman in a country where they are repressed though this is used more as a plot device than overriding theme. Danger arrives when it needs to teaching a necessary lesson.So too does love. Or romance. Or sex at least.Tina Fey plays Kim Baker and Nicholas Braun plays Tall Brian in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)The film is most interesting when the adrenaline and the thrill the chance of death and the excitement of escaping it begin to take its hold on Baker. She starts to feel at home in Kabul which is definitely not a homey kind of place. It makes her work better but this comes at a time when networks (and in fairness their audiences) were losing interest in Afghanistan shifting their focus and resources to Iran.This brings out the competitive side in everyone as they fight for airtime. Thats natural among journalists. In a war zone it can also be dangerous.AZCENTRALTina Fey Its so stressful to be an actor for hireThe film oddly is not. Too bad.

Tina Fey stars as an embedded war journalist in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.(Photo Frank Masi)In taking Tina Fey to war Whiskey Tango Foxtrot utilizes her comedic weaponry while also showing shes well armed with dramatic chops too.Boasting the fish-way-out-of-water nature of Private Benjamin and M.A.S.H.s absurdity and grotesquerie of battle the comedy ( out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) tries to get real about embedded journalists in ""the suck"" of mid-2000s Afghanistan. It wobbles in terms of an authentic feel yet theres no doubt Fey succeeds in her most serious big-screen outing yet.Shes cast as Kim Baker a bored cable news writer suddenly enlisted in very active duty when her media outlet needs an on-camera face in Kabul. (The plot is based on the real-life story of former Chicago Tribune reporter Kim Barker.) Right away Kims life is thrown into disarray in a ""fun house"" of journalistic bacchanalia being uncomfortably surrounded by sex -- be it the humping dogs outside her room or star reporter pal Tanya (Margot Robbie) wanting to bed Kims Kiwi security guy. She also quickly gets on the bad side of gruff Marine Col. Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) who immediately sees her as a potential distraction for his men.USA TODAYTina Fey faces shrapnel sexism as Whiskey heroineSoon Kim befriends soldiers throws herself into firefights for footage cozies up to a cocksure Scottish photographer (Martin Freeman) and begins to get a high from her lifestyle of daytime danger and nighttime vices. Its a boon for her career that takes a toll on her personally.The team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Crazy Stupid Love) direct the script by Robert Carlock a longtime Fey collaborator who definitely knows her voice and gives her plenty of great one-liners -- its like target practice for a comedy pro like Fey. Carlock balances those elements with the horrors of war well while also surprisingly touching on relevant topics such as the often cutthroat nature of journalism when a great story is on the line.USA TODAYTina Fey Margot Robbie go to war in Whiskey Tango FoxtrotIn addition theres an undercurrent of sexism that the film tackles head on especially in regard to the plight of women in that part of the world. Labeled ""Kabul cute"" when Kim arrives in the country -- Tanya tells her that a woman whos a 6 in Manhattan is a 10 in their new war-torn home -- theres a striking shift in how certain men look at Kim when she has to wear the ""blue prison"" of a body-covering burqa on a trip to Kandahar.With that kind of detail paid to the culture its puzzling why a pair of actors who arent from Afghanistan or the Middle East were cast as Kabul regulars. Christopher Abbott as Kims resident helper Fahim reads on the surface as dissonant and is only saved by Abbott being a bit of a revelation as he brings a touching and powerful quality to the role. Similarly Alfred Molina is also noteworthy as over-the-top political up-and-comer Sadiq who yearns to be Kims ""very special friend"" and takes her out to fire machine guns so he can get to know her better.Even with the occasional misfire in the plot Feys strong performance throughout the film lets Whiskey go down in smooth and satisfying fashion. 104 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1oRB6D4",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/03/whiskey-tango-foxtrot-movie-review/81196796/,200,whiskeytangofoxtrot32,whiskeytangofoxtrot,usatoday

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is not one of those. The potential is certainly there -- the film is adapted by Robert Carlock from war correspondent Kim Barkers The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan chronicling her years spent covering the United States post-9-11 invasion of the two countries -- but in the hands of directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa that potential is squandered.Tina Fey also continues her mostly uninspired run of films -- Hollywoods inability to find a project well-suited to her immense talent remains baffling -- portraying Kim Baker (as she is renamed here) a news copy writer for a cable TV news channel in New York who impulsively plunges into the chaos of covering a war. (The real Barker was the Chicago Tribunes South Asia bureau chief from 2004 to 2009.)The shift from print to TV is the first indicator that Foxtrot intends to take the easy way out -- who wants to watch a reporter take notes and write stories when they can spout exposition in front of a camera? -- and coming on the heels of Best Picture Oscar winner Spotlight Foxtrot represents a return to the movies default depiction of journalism. While Foxtrot gives some inkling of the difficulties of reporting from the front lines far more of the run time is given over to rom-com entanglements and off-camera banter. Not that the film needed to be a docudrama but a little balance might have helped.Baker quickly befriends the glamorous Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) who glides through the grime and soon becomes acquainted with rascally Scottish journalist Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman) and the high-level Afghan official Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina).Baker learns the ropes earning the trust of General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) and familiarizing herself with the often-mystifying customs of her host country. (One of Whiskey Tango Foxtrots few bright spots involves an incredulous Baker being forced to wear a burqa to report in Kandahar.) Whiskey Tango Foxtrots biggest misstep is a failure to find the right tone. Much of the first hour is so breezy and mock-filthy -- profanity is scattered about less for emphasis than for show -- that when gruesome war violence intrudes upon the narrative the film cant handle the shift. It reaches its nadir during a nighttime raid ostensibly a high-stakes affair to rescue a kidnap victim scored by Harry Nilssons Without You and punctuated with wisecracks.Fey and the cast -- particularly Freeman and Molina both of whom rip into their roguish roles with relish -- try to anchor Whiskey Tango Foxtrot which was shot in New Mexico a not-entirely convincing double for Afghanistan. Despite everyones best efforts the end result is a war in which everyone -- and especially the audience -- loses.

(Frank Masi/AP) Movie review of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" Its ugly American time in Kabul in this drama starring Tina Fey as a hard-partying and not very ethical -- or smart -- American war correspondent. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Theres a war on. Lets party. And so they do in ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" Oh do they ever. Movie Review    Whiskey Tango Foxtrot with Tina Fey Margot Robbie Martin Freeman Christopher Abbott Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa from a screenplay by Robert Carlock based on a memoir by Kim Barker. 111 minutes. Rated R for pervasive language some sexual content drug use and violent war images. Several theaters. Bop til you drop boogie til you puke is the order of the evenings for hard-living Western war correspondents in dusty Kabul Afghanistan during the early 2000s dancing with desperate abandon until a bomb goes off somewhere. And then its time to sober up strap on a flak vest grab a camera and run out to capture the carnage. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

And again. Rinse and repeat. Strange movie. And despite the presence of Tina Fey playing its lead character a cable-TV reporter named Kim Baker its not a funny one. Adapted from ""The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" a 2011 memoir by real-life former Chicago Tribune correspondent Kim Barker (who also worked at The Seattle Times and is now at The New York Times) it yo-yos between alcohol-soaked party sequences and scenes of Baker (the filmmakers dropped the first ""r"" in the characters last name) convoying and helicoptering with the troops interviewing Afghans (a glaring warlord a lascivious bureaucrat) and repeatedly blundering heedlessly into dangerous situations. When theres a firefight she runs toward it. When theres a mob of fundamentalist Muslim men angrily railing against Western technology she disguised in a burqa makes a beeline to their midst. Those episodes are inventions of the filmmakers (Glenn Ficarra and John Requa directed from a screenplay by Robert Carlock) and in them Baker comes across as careless and stupid. Another invented sequence in which she blackmails a high-ranking Afghan official into disclosing information that Baker turns over to the U.S. military to assist in the rescue of a Westerner held by the Taliban reveals shes unethical. The concentration of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (militaryspeak for ""WTF"" which means exactly what you think it does) on the carousing and on the dismal details of Bakers rocky love life in which her paramours are either peevish or unfaithful (or both) contributes to a pervasive sense of sourness. Baker is not very sympathetic and neither with very few exceptions is anybody else on-screen. Its ugly American time in Kabul.

Credit Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures 2.5 stars (out of 4)Whos in the mood for a middling war-zone version of Eat Pray Love? Minus the eating. And the praying. And the love. No matter. This drama still depicts another bright-yet-unhappy middle-aged womans bumpy journey to self-discovery. Like Elizabeth Gilbert real-life writer Kim Barker is naturally empathetic flaws and all. But her story is stuck in a movie grappling with its own identity crisis. Tina Fey takes on the heroine character in her most impressive and challenging role to date. The misleading trailers would have you believe that shes playing a wacky woman who travels overseas on a whim after finding out her boyfriend is a cheater. The reality is slightly less cliche A successful 42-year-old New York City TV news writer Kim drudges through life with ennui. In 2004 with the Iraq War raging she takes on an assignment to report overseas in Kabul Afghanistan. Her ""mildly depressive"" man (Josh Charles) is still in the picture when she leaves for whats supposed to be a three-month gig. Tina Fey as Sarah Palin Will Ferrell as George W. Bush and More of SNLs Best Political Impressions of All Time At first Kim closed-off by nature is ill at ease in her new surroundings. Shes bunking with a bunch of fellow journalists and within the first day a Lara Logan-type bombshell (Margot Robbie) asks if its cool if she sleeps with her hot Aussie bodyguard. Kim also lugs around a bright orange backpack much to the chagrin of a Marine general (Billy Bob Thornton) and his camouflaged troops. And dont even go there with the polluted feces-filled air. Christopher Abbott as Fahim Ahmadzai Tina Fey as Kim Barker and Billy Bob Thornton as General Hollanek (from left) in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Frank Masi/Paramount Pictures Granted a quippy fish-out-of-water story isnt the ideal way to frame a film when life and death are at stake. And Fey innately comes off as too intelligent to play the whiny hapless princess. Yet its jarring how quickly Kim acclimates herself. The very first time she treks on a ride-along with the Marines she witnesses an enemy gunfire attack. Instead of staying in the Humvee as instructed she runs out to film the action without batting a mascaraed eyelash. From there the film cant decide where to go or what to do with her or even what it is. In tonally schizophrenic episodes Kim starts to fall for a rakish Scottish photographer (romance) struggles with understanding the language (comedy) and turns into a respected front-line TV war correspondent (you-go-girl inspiration).Or maybe this is supposed to be a meditation on the treatment of females in the Middle East. In one scene Kim must wear a head-to-toe burqa to do investigative reporting and ... oh never mind the endeavor is fruitless. Even the journalism-in-the-trenches bonding unravels as besties Fey and Robbie turn into hostile rivals -- a ludicrous and borderline offensive development. Must two high-powered women always compete with each other? Margot Robbie Cara Delevingne Join the Pink Hair Gang See Hollywoods Biggest Beauty Trend in Action With the appealing Fey in the lead though were inclined to invest in her adventures in the desert. Surely theres a Kim Barker inside most career women of a certain age -- i.e. a secret curiosity about exploring a wanderlust office-free lifestyle. If only screenwriter Robert Carlock (30 Rock) knew this line of thinking is more of an ellipsis than a series of exclamation points.  Clearly Kim has succeeded in shaking things up and is headed in an exciting new life direction. No need for her to blackmail the lecherous Afghan attorney general and convince the troops to stage a dangerous kidnapping rescue attempt And after all that drama she still demands closure upon closure. WTF indeed.

War is no place for anybody which is one of the ideas nailed by this zig-zagging high-spirited movie Though we ought to be used to the idea of women reporting from war zones--Christiane Amanpour and Lara Logan are the two names nearly everyone knows at least from the realm of TV--the old notions of ""war is no place for a woman"" cling stubbornly. Actually war is no place for anybody which is one of the ideas nailed by the zig-zagging high-spirited Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (writers of the curmudgeonly Christmas masterpiece Bad Santa) Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a fictionalized version of former Chicago Tribune journalist Kim Barkers 2011 memoir The Taliban Shuffle an account of the time she spent in Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2004 to 2009. In Foxtrot Barker has been transformed into a broadcast journalist named Kim Baker and shes played by superstar comic Tina Fey. But lets not confuse a movies adherence to facts with the sidelong truths it reveals Whiskey Tango Foxtrot captures the texture of one persons experience in a place where she knows she shouldnt be and helps us understand why she fears shell never want to be anyplace else. When Feys Kim first arrives in Kabul--shes a lowly writer of news copy who volunteers for the gig to shake up her staid life--she gets everything wrong Shes outfitted herself with a ""military grade"" sporting-goods-store backpack that just happens to be bright ""Shoot me now"" orange. The Marine colonel in charge of the unit in which shes been embedded Hollanek (a marvelously taciturn Billy Bob Thornton) will have none of it He tosses her a roll of camouflage-patterned duct tape and orders her to cover the damn thing. She becomes close with her shy astute Afghan translator Fahim (Christopher Abbot). More than once she also needlessly endangers him and others around her by taking thoughtless risks. Kim tries to be sensitive but she still ends up being the ugly American leaving her big clumsy footprints all over someone elses culture. Her experience is a model of what it means to learn as you go. You can say that as a journalist she should know better--but the best writers teach us the most by letting us tag along as they figure things out. Feys Kim is also of course a woman finding her way in an Islamic culture whose strictures have been tightened even further by Taliban rule. She knows better than to go out without a headscarf and dons a burka--in the same universal blue worn by all the women--when her guides lead her out of Kabul and deeper into more conservative (and more dangerous) territory. Even then she overestimates how much the garment can protect her at one point striding into a men-only zone and igniting a near-deadly scuffle. But as a woman she also learns certain things the men cant. Hollanek whose men have been charged with helping the Afghans but end up doing more harm than good expresses frustration that the wells hes been digging as a service to the townsfolk keep getting blown up. Kim finds out why because only she is allowed into the inner circle of the local women--shes beckoned almost seductively into an impromptu meeting in a local house and Ficarra Requa and cinematographer Xavier Grobet shoot the scene in a gorgeously poetic way. Even westerners who see the burka as a symbol of oppression cant really know just by looking how the women who wear it--by choice or otherwise--feel about it. Ficarra and Requa dont presume to know either; what they do understand is that this garment can have multiple meanings for the human beings cloaked inside. And so they hint at the details of this women-only confab from a respectful distance lending it a muted mysterious beauty. Beyond that Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is just boldly entertaining. Margot Robbie plays Kims game hard-partying bestie Martin Freeman is the rascally freelance photographer she sleeps with against her better judgment Alfred Molina is the high-ranking Afghan government official who salaciously tries to lure her into bed. All are wonderful and Fey is terrific too Her timing has always been superb but lately shes settled into a kind of autopilot precision. Here playing not just against other actors but also against gunshots and explosions she cant rely on shtick--her way with a line is still firecracker sharp but she shows a new surprising softness too. By now you may be asking Should a movie about reporting from such a deeply troubled country really be this entertaining? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot does smooth the corners of the thorny Afghanistan problem. (Barkers book for all its larkish black humor paints a more desolate picture.) And you could question whether its right that Western journalists as unwanted guests in a country that forbids such things should spend so much time hooking up and partying--Whiskey Tango Foxtrot shows plenty of that. But when Feys Kim finally realizes how hard shes fallen for this dusty despairing country--and how hooked shes gotten on the adrenaline kick of being there--the sly complexity of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot slips into focus. Too bad the title Enemies A Love Story is already taken. That would have been perfect. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Why did Tina Fey ever want to leave TV in the first place? She had it so good. For all her groundbreaking success on 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live (shell always get mileage out of that pitch-perfect Sarah Palin) the showrunners transition to the big screen has been a series of forgettable whiffs Baby Mama Date Night Sisters. Finally the spell is broken with the robustly entertaining Whiskey Tango Foxtrot a war-journalism film in shooting distance of the mighty Broadcast News--one that not only finds a perfect MASH-like milieu for its wisecracking lead but even manages to accommodate Feys inspiring offscreen status as a woman in charge. She plays Kim an unmarried workaholic whose sad dish of mystery tuna salad listlessly picked at speaks volumes about her unexciting life. Selected among other unattached staffers at her cable channel to become an Afghanistan-based war correspondent Kim decides not to crumple into a crying heap but instead to go hoisting an orange backpack thats certain to be a beacon for enemy sniper fire. This material comes from real-life Kim Barkers 2011 memoir The Taliban Shuffle and while big liberties have been taken with the facts Robert Carlocks witty script sharpens the book into a spear. Fey engages in verbal sparring with four pros Margot Robbies sexpot frenemy journo Alfred Molinas slimy local official Billy Bob Thorntons begrudgingly admiring military man and--best of all--Martin Freemans mouthy Scottish photographer who becomes something more. By the time Fey is able to say the words ""This is not about you"" the comedy owns the feminism it always had. The war scenes are only so-so but it wins a bigger battle.

The mild Islamophobia and highly questionable casting choices in the film call to mind other texting abbreviations -- namely AYFKMWTS and GTFOOH. In the end though its an armed-forces acronym dating back to World War II that best describes this dismal project FUBAR.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is based on reporter Kim Barkers 2011 memoir The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan (which I havent read). In the big-screen adaptation the first R is dropped from the authors surname (as are her escapades in the second country of the title) and her career is slightly tweaked Kim Baker (Tina Fey) is a writer for a cable-news channel in New York not a print journalist (Barker formerly with the Chicago Tribune is now on the Metro desk at the New York Times).Film Details Whiskey Tango Foxtrot RatingR GenreComedy Running Time111 min. More Info Trailer The film signals her sad-lady status with the bottle of over-forty multivitamins on her desk the exercise bike she rides in a grim windowless room and the ""mildly depressive"" boyfriend (Josh Charles) who never seems to be in town. Kim signs up for a three-month assignment in Kabul in 2003 a post she stretches out to years. In the Afghan capital the diffident journo blooms She becomes a confident on-air correspondent pounds both scotch and a Scottish freelance photographer (Martin Freeman) and in what has become a prerequisite for all Fey vehicles cabbage-patches to Nineties old-school jams.WTF is essentially Eat Pray Love for embeds filled with jokes and sight gags that are repeated to ever stonier spectator silence. The wearying self-explanatory looks-inflation system known as ""Kabul cute"" -- applicable to women only -- is clarified to Kim twice within five minutes of screen time first by a fellow reporter (Margot Robbie) and then by a Marine colonel (Billy Bob Thornton); though she picks up Pashto and Dari quickly the new arrival to Afghanistan it would seem has trouble grasping the difference between the numbers 4 and 10.Incessant shots of mongrel-humping typify WTFs disregard for the battle-ravaged Central Asian nation -- which is actually played by New Mexico. When Kim remarks to her fixer ""I know you like your women to be beautiful mysterious Ikea bags"" -- a dig followed by an artlessly inserted sequence of a group of women in blue burkas walking in the square -- we are meant not to be appalled by her bigotry but to chortle along with her forthrightness. More distressingly the actor playing Kims intermediary is Connecticut native Christopher Abbott (best known for Girls and James White) who apparently possesses the lone qualifications Hollywood demands to portray an Afghan native the ability to grow a thick beard and look good in a pakol. Abbotts Fahim Ahmadzai at least is constructed as a noble (if one-dimensional) character. In contrast Alfred Molina as the corrupt concupiscent attorney general the other prominent ""Afghan"" in the film has been instructed to play as broad as the Khyber Pass.Ficarra and Requas directorial debut the zippy same-sex romantic comedy I Love You Phillip Morris (2009) which they also wrote provided lead Jim Carrey with one of his greatest roles; the actors manic energy refocused in that film was divided equally between id and libido. WTF however confirms whats been obvious ever since 2004s Mean Girls Feys first major film outing that the performer and writer whos done so many outstanding things on the small screen has frequently been ill-served by the big one.Feys movies WTF especially not only reveal how limited her acting range is but also lead to extreme cognitive dissonance as theyre often the kinds of pandering cultural products her TV shows would skewer. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt like 30 Rock before it brilliantly calls attention to the pathologies and absurdities of white privilege (the earlier show giving us the immortal phrase ""white nonsense"" delivered by Sherri Shepherds Angie Jordan). WTF which was produced by Fey (along with Lorne Michaels and others) and written by Robert Carlock a chief collaborator on Kimmy Schmidt and 30 Rock only lightly jabs at its heroine. ""That is officially the most American-white-lady story Ive ever heard"" a Lebanese colleague (Sheila Vand) tells Kim after she constructs a dopey metaphor involving that stationary bike seen in WTFs opening minutes to explain why shes in Kabul. But the American white ladys story is the official one here the horrors she is surrounded by mere backdrop to her self-improvement.Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Paramount Pictures Opens March 4 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Melissa Anderson Follow MelissEAnderson Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

And Whiskey Tango Foxtrot doesnt make an easy case for itself off the top; both the rom and the com fumble to connect and the chaos-racked country its set in feels uncomfortably like set dressing for yet another white-lady voyage of self-discovery. (The cultural-sensitivity angle is also more than a little problematic but more on that later.) Still the script based on journalist Kim Barkers acclaimed 2011 memoir The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan has some great source material and it eventually starts to settle into a more natural groove. Tina Fey stars as the nominally name-changed Kim Baker a fortysomething New Yorker living a life of if not quiet desperation at least chronic dullness Her TV newswriting job is uninspiring her boyfriend (Josh Charles) is ""mildly depressive"" and the only living things shes responsible for besides herself are a sad set of houseplants. So when her network bosses call for warm bodies on the ground in the Middle East she decides to cash it all in and take an open-ended correspondent post in Kabul. Arriving in 2002 with no real training and even less knowledge of local customs she finds herself tossed directly into the deep end -- embedding with a flinty general (Billy Bob Thornton) following leads down dark alleys and dusty back roads and learning to be an on-air reporter as she goes. She also falls in quickly with the citys expat community a motley crew who treat their coed lodgings like a sort of mercenary summer camp with booze (theres a lot of whiskey in this Whiskey Tango) promiscuity and seemingly nightly dance parties. Kim still has the depressive boyfriend back home but as Australian adrenaline junkie/blond goddess Tanya (Margot Robbie) helpfully informs her ""In New York youre like a six seven? Here youre a nine -- borderline 10."" (That of course makes Tanya approximately a 15.) Soon more than a few suitors begin to circle including a rakish Scottish photographer named Iain (Martin Freeman who somehow makes even dolphin-sex jokes sound charming). Fey leans hard -- too hard early on -- on Kims cluelessness and her own wry self-aware Fey-ness; shes essentially a braver Liz Lemon in a flak jacket minus the eyeglasses and the songs about cheese (see sidebar). And its more than a little disappointing that two major Afghan supporting roles are filled by obviously non-Afghan actors Kims local translator (played by Girls Christopher Abbott) and a government minister (a mugging Alfred Molina). Maybe codirectors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Focus; Crazy Stupid Love) just thought they had the best guys for the job or maybe they both had an Internet blackout during the whole Emma Stone Aloha thing; either way it feels like a misguided choice at best. What work better in the movie are mostly smaller moments the jokes that land the rapport between the reporters and all the weirdly ordinary ways people manage to find a new normal even in the most WTF circumstances.

Fey plays a fictionalized version of Barker named Kim Baker a back-bench network news writer in New York who in 2003 takes an offer to go to Afghanistan as an onscreen reporter. Based in Kabul embedded with Marines under the command of a crusty colonel (Billy Bob Thornton) Kim learns the ropes while socializing hard in the so-called Kabubble--notably with Tanya (Margot Robbie) a friendly competitor; Iain (Martin Freeman) a randy one; Fahim (Christopher Abbott) her local handler; and Sadiq (Alfred Molina) a government official who wants to be more than a source. (Why the near uniformly Anglo casting?) The writer Robert Carlock and the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa see Afghanistan through an American lens of gender inequality rooted in Afghan mens religious dogmatism and hypocrisy while also looking benignly at the unifying charm of ethnic tradition. Distinguishing the American armed forces good intentions from wise and well-conceived actions the filmmakers keep to the surface of the bluntly rowdy story while conveying apolitical layers of regret and exasperation in wanly comic and affectingly melodramatic action alike.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Daily Edition Login to download Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Film Review 500 PM PST 2/28/2016 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Paramount Pictures/Screenshot Could have used more edge and surprise. TWITTER 3/4/2016 Tina Fey headlines this seriocomic look at a female reporter in Afghanistan directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Focus) and co-starring Margot Robbie. Apropos of Hollywoods now-burgeoning sub-genre of comedies about initially hapless non-combatants who find themselves in Afghanistan it can be decisively stated that Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is superior to last years Rock the Kasbah. Which isnt saying much only that its moderately more amusing to follow Tiny Feys quick-study newshound through the fleshpots of Kabul and the peril of the militia-infested countryside than to suffer through Bill Murray floundering around as a Hollywood music manager who discovers a wonderful singer in the middle of nowhere -- even if it seems as though both films used many of the same sets and locations. Moderate later winter box-office appears in store for this very uneven blend of prankish black humor and topical drama. In its review of journalist Kim Barkers 2011 book The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan The New York Times remarked that the author ""depicts herself as a sort of Tina Fey character."" And so it has come to pass that Fey has donned the headscarf of a fortysomething adrenaline junkie who tests herself against the rigors danger and debauchery of life on a very uncertain front in the wars on terror of the mid-2000s. The first act represents a virtual replay of Kasbah which despite its big cast names went on to gross all of 3 million worldwide Theres the nerve-wracking flight to Kabul the greeting by assorted hunky security personnel the rank hotel and above all the Westerners wild nightclub which looks like a place where the wolf of Wall Street would be right at home and is made all the more so by the presence of Margot Robbies hard-drinking Tanya Vanderpoel. This blunt blond beauty begins by asking Kim (ever-so-slightly renamed Baker here) if her personal security guys are available for her to boff and then helpfully informs her that women who would be rated a four or a six back home might sometimes be considered a 10 by the men here. Kim plausibly wonders what score knockout Tanya registers by local standards. Kims hunky New Zealander guardian Nic (Stephen Peacocke) could be a good-times candidate but not for Kim whos just in the country for a three-month stint while her boyfriend waits back in New York City. Instead screenwriter and longtime Fey collaborator Robert Carlock (Saturday Night Live 30 Rock Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) devotes the early-going to pro forma exposition about how ""this here is a forgotten war"" and mild boot-campy stuff in which Kim is shown the ropes deals with the anarchic scramble that is downtown Kabul and embarrassingly requires a military caravan to stop so she can get out and pee. By this point one strongly suspects that comedy and Afghanistan simply dont mix. Just as it looks as though Kim just isnt cut out for this beat a massively convenient plot device involving a Skype with her boyfriend cuts her restraints and she jumps into action both professionally with some hot war footage and amorously with rude and sarcastic Scottish photographer Iain (Martin Freeman in a vivid change of pace from his long Middle-earth and Baker Street gigs). In short order Kim becomes part of the ballsy hard-driving live-for-today-because-you-never-know-about-tomorrow fraternity although in one of the more amusing subplots she does stop short of agreeing to become the ""special friend"" of a top local politician and valuable source (a heavily bearded Alfred Molina in a funny performance). Even as Kim hunkers down for the long haul (she ends up spending two years in the region) and tragedy and loss inevitably become part of her life the film remains fundamentally superficial offering no take on the politics of the region Westerners role there the usefulness of the journalists the views of locals et al. One fairly tense scene has Kim surreptitiously recording a local men-only religious/political conclave but when dramatic urgency finally arrives late in the game it strictly involves the central characters safety and happiness and does nothing to illuminate the larger geopolitical picture. More than anything then Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is about careerism which in this case involves gathering your wits and courage abandoning customary niceties and inhibitions becoming unhesitantly assertive and once the action briefly returns to New York headquarters coping with some competitive female conniving and duplicity. The film could have been about any high-stakes modern profession for all it cares about war international politics the military or religion much less the specific conditions within the country where it mostly takes place. As in their previous films (I Love You Phillip Morris; Crazy Stupid Love; Focus) directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa enjoy just scattershot success in hitting their seriocomic targets scoring from time to time with their more coarse and outlandish gambits but rarely inducing one to take what theyre watching very seriously. Visually they keep pretty tight on the actors when some broader perspectives and complex shots involving more character interaction might have heightened the visual interest. More than anything one feels the directors are there to serve Fey whose performance is as energetic as it is fundamentally predictable; one never expects Kim to do anything other than get it together and rise to the occasion and thats exactly what she does. There are no surprises or hitherto untapped resources mined here.

The title of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is in some ways more interesting to contemplate than the movie itself Some will immediately recognize it as military-alphabet-speak for ""WTF"" while its jammed-together three-word construction may remind others of ""Eat Pray Love"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- two movies that improbable as it sounds are among the many disparate influences here. Starring a game but tamped-down Tina Fey as a journalist embedded in Afghanistan in the mid-2000s this haphazard fish-out-of-water dramedy tries to show how the rush of war can become its own weird escape from reality but never really hits the surreal satirical groove its aiming for. And despite the scripts direct acknowledgment that its telling a ""white-American-lady story"" the movie never quite shakes off a glib incurious outsiders perspective that can tilt into outright cluelessness particularly where some of its more egregious casting choices are concerned. While its certain to outgross last years American-in-Afghanistan disaster ""Rock the Kasbah"" Paramounts March 4 release may struggle to match the box office returns of Feys ""Sisters"" which preceded it in theaters by less than three months. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" aims to recast the actresss comic persona in a more thoughtful and tonally ambitious light Shes playing a fictionalized version of the journalist Kim Barker whose sharply observed 2011 memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle"" -- about her experiences covering Afghanistan and Pakistan -- provides the general inspiration for the screenplay by Robert Carlock (Feys small-screen collaborator on ""30 Rock"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt""). Signaling the movies fast-and-loose way with the truth Fey is playing not Kim Barker but Kim Baker who is not a Chicago Tribune reporter but a general news producer for a TV network stuck writing stories about the dangers of high-fructose corn syrup when in 2004 a foreign correspondents position opens up in Afghanistan. Being an ideal candidate for the job (childless and unmarried) and feeling ready for something new Kim bids a temporary farewell to her boyfriend (Josh Charles) and jets off to Kabul where she lands in a haze of dust wind and low-grade slapstick ""Cover yourself shameless whore"" a local woman yells at Kim (helpfully translated with subtitles) shortly before the hapless foreigner loses all her money. Fortunately her local fixer and translator Farouk (Christopher Abbott) is on hand to help her acclimatize to the desert temps and the restrictive dress code though conditions are a bit more lax inside the cramped frat-house-style quarters that Kim finds herself sharing with the other Western interlopers along for this crazy ride. Chief among them are Tanya (Margot Robbie) a savvy sexy reporter who cheerfully describes Kim as ""a serious piece of ass"" (in Afghanistan at least); Nic (Stephen Peacocke) the buff tattoo-covered security contractor who frequently catches Kims eye; and Iain (Martin Freeman) a rude foul-mouthed British photographer whose initially barbed exchanges with Kim suggest its only a matter of time before they fall into bed. But then as Barkers book made clear almost everyone has sex on the brain in this hot sweaty and often tedious outpost When Kim gets her first embed with a U.S. Marine unit the first direct order she receives from the stern Gen. Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) is that she not sleep with any of his men. Even the Afghan prime minister Ali Massoud Sadiq (a boisterous Alfred Molina) upon being introduced to Kim for the purposes of an interview wastes little time in making thinly veiled romantic overtures to his new ""special friend."" This is hardly the first time directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have put a playful contemporary spin on romantic-comedy conventions as evidenced by 2009s ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" 2011s ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (perhaps we should be grateful the new movie isnt called ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."") and last years ""Focus"" (which also co-starred Robbie). In this their first picture centered entirely around a female protagonist the directors would seem to have set themselves a difficult yet potentially rewarding challenge a farce driven by equal parts friskiness and firepower in which the challenges of being an American woman in a female-repressive society dovetail with the complications of a stuck-in-a-rut midlife-crisis comedy -- call it ""Its Complicated in Kabul"" or perhaps ""What Women Want in Wartime."" Insofar as Barkers book limned both the thrill and the tedium of life in a never-ending war zone its hardly a knock that ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" often feels rough-hewn and scattershot as lensed with jagged handheld roughness by d.p. Xavier Grobet and briskly cut together by editor Jan Kovac. Evenness is not to be expected or desired from a movie that can veer from a fiery shootout with Taliban insurgents to a lazy afternoon hangout back at headquarters with any number of jittery skirmishes and late-night drinking sessions in between. And given how many tediously well-meaning prestige pictures have approached Third World suffering through the eyes of a benevolent white do-gooder theres something refreshing in theory about a movie that attempts in the grand tradition of ""Catch-22"" and ""MASH"" to offer a jaundiced cynical take on an impossible situation. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" unfortunately winds up feeling cynical for all the wrong reasons and far less authentic than its generally convincing New Mexico desert locations. Theres a difference between seeing the darkly funny side of our nations recent geopolitical misadventures and twisting said misadventures into a blandly crowdpleasing formula and the movie falls into that particular sand trap again and again Its laughs quite apart from being patchy and obvious have the effect of puncturing what little tension or sense of danger Ficarra and Requa manage to muster. And it would take a far defter touch to bridge the gap between the pics hostile environs and the contemporary fairy tale its selling Whether its a romantic subplot that gets resolved with a harrowing rescue mission or a self-serving career move that winds up exacting collateral damage any concessions here to the awful harrowing reality of life during wartime register as little more than lip service. Carlocks script skims the surface of everything it touches reliably losing interest at precisely the moment things might start to get well interesting -- and unfortunately that extends most of all to the character of Kim Baker/Barker herself. The movie unfolds between 2004 and 2006 at a time when the Iraq War is continually drawing attention and resources away from Afghanistan and Kim weary of life in the ""Kabubble"" grows increasingly unhappy that the network keeps burying her stories -- a conflict that carries zero weight since the movie seems singularly uninvested in the matter of her actual skills as a journalist. Why blame the network when the movie itself cant be bothered to show Kims exclusive interview with an Afghan warlord but instead cuts away after a few lame gags? Unlike her partner-in-crime Amy Poehler Fey has yet to find a cinematic vehicle that really suits her less pointed more self-effacing comic persona (""Mean Girls"" which she wrote remains the highlight of her big-screen resume) and theres something vague and shiftless about her work even in this ostensibly meaty part. Still hers is a veritable triumph of casting next to the placement of Molina and Abbott in prominent Afghan roles. Never mind that theyre fine actors; Abbott so wrenching in ""James White"" retains his sweetly empathetic presence and its understandable that Molina has become like Omar Sharif and Ricardo Montalban before him a master of many ethnic guises. But in the wake of the industrys recent diversity woes the decision to cast two white actors -- in a movie thats ostensibly about breaking down barriers and embracing the new-- feels all the more resoundingly tone-deaf. What were all the appropriate actors in Hollywood too busy being killed by Kiefer Sutherland on the latest ""24"" special? Whiskey tango foxtrot indeed.

Madame K says March 30 2016 at 120 pm I liked it. A lot. When you are in insane situations you crack lame jokes. You struggle between self-interest and higher moral impulses. And if youre a woman you also put up with a lot of crap. Loved Tina Fey in this. Navel-gazing review above seems to be about a different movie. Yeah the faux-Afghan castings are clueless but the movie is realistic nonetheless. I was actually concerned Tina Fey would be her zany comedy persona of which Im getting a bit tired so this was a solidly pleasant surprise. This is a damned good movie. Reply KT says March 19 2016 at 1146 pm How am I supposed to take this review seriously when the writer cant even get the details of the movie right. Did he even watch it?? Her photographer love interest is Scottish not ""British"" and the story took place between 2003 and 2006 (not 2004-2006). If youre going to trash a good movie with a strong female lead (is that what the writer really didnt like?) you need to have actually watched the movie Reply Char says March 9 2016 at 954 am Thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I got the point of the addictive rush for individual with a previous mundane life and the need to disengage and recognize the seriousness of such war activities. I also enjoyed the historical and Afghan culture weave. Characters were well developed. I didnt know if Id enjoy a movie centered in a war... but the choices of aliens boy doll criticized resurrection terrorism in England themes didnt appeal at all- a disconnect for me. I appreciated the moments of humor otherwise too depressing. Mrs. M Reply Alice Friend says March 5 2016 at 846 am I disagree and am fascinated and puzzled that so many reviewers share Changs perspective. There are very few laughs in this movie which is a good thing because it makes for a better narrative. Of course they puncture tension with jokes-thats what humans do when theyre in a war they try to make light of it. But such jokes always fall flat to any outsider because they arent all that funny unless nothing else around you is. As for taking her seriously as a journalist the point of the opening scene of the film is to show you where the character winds up professionally arguing with her producer over the phone while defending herself against sexual harassment in (presumably) Pashto all while being unfazed by the mayhem and bloodshed after a bombing. Maybe this isnt the clean-edged Hollywood vision of being a civilian woman in war but thank goodness because that means its accurate. I think the Margot Robbie character is almost designed to be that counterpoint. As for ""skimming the surface"" this movie is in the tradition of The Things They Carried everything in war skims the surface and yet impacts you profoundly and you can never tell what really happened. It is so perplexing because it is so quotidian and momentous at the same time. I liked that the movie didnt pause pollyanna-ish to gee-whiz at the world. Feys character reacts realistically with a simultaneous detachment and obsession. And I am not sure why but most of the reviewers also missed that the movie isnt woman-discovers-self but woman-learns-about-the-addiction-to-adrenaline-of-conflict. In this way its a commentary on all of civilian society. The care the film took to get military ranks and most importantly inter-service rivalry right (not to mention powerpoint briefings) is just one sign that the filmmakers did their homework and really got it. I wish reviewers would do the same. Reply dee says March 4 2016 at 1003 am What is the deal with the over pedantic writing by writers on Variety?? Its hard to follow the annoying techy wordy review. Stop trying to impress people with your vocabulary ... and just get to the point I dont mind lengthy descriptions of the movie and what you think of it; just be concise and CLEAR. I swear media and drugs are mixing very badly in this day and age. Anyway. WTF sucks just from the trailer alone. And when you put a mediocre actress who is as funny as my ... (lets see what metaphor can I use today while keeping it clean on here) my old worn out stained coffee cup that says Orange on it with the image of a slice of orange you get a crappier movie to boot. Also there are only about two or three fake reviewers under comments. Now that says something. Dont waste your money and give these people your money either. Reply Ben says February 29 2016 at 718 pm Whiskey Tango Foxtrot was a fun movie. We just saw a screening and thought it was great Reply William hickey says February 29 2016 at 603 pm I disagree I dont think so absolutely not I want keifer Sutherland back NOW on 24 bring Jack Bauer back NOW before time runs out if you dont I going to call my lawyer for good deal good Reply Hal says February 29 2016 at 1029 am Chris White who is anglo and Alfred Molina who is Spanish/Italian play the Afghanis? Way to go liberal Hollywood. Reply John G. says February 29 2016 at 808 am ""What were all the Middle Eastern actors in Hollywood too busy being killed by Kiefer Sutherland on the latest ""24"" special?"" Afghanistan is not in the Middle East but in South Asia the region which contains India and Pakistan. If the movie had taken place in a Middle Eastern country like Lebanon or Syria Abbott (Italian/Portuguese) and Molina (Italian/Spanish) would be perfectly appropriate casting choices. Reply AW says February 29 2016 at 525 am Afghans are not Arabs. Reply Nilofar says March 7 2016 at 149 am Thank you for saying this. As an Afghan I can confirm that we are not Arab or Middle Eastern either. Just because were brown Muslims doesnt mean were Arab. We speak completely different languages dont share the same culture and we dont border any Arab country either. Reply kenjimoto says March 6 2016 at 514 pm And Brits are not Scots Reply Michael Klossner says February 28 2016 at 810 pm Afghans are not Arabs. Reply Bill says February 28 2016 at 635 pm Proving yet again that there is no review Variety cannot turn into a race-centered screed sigh... Reply kenjimoto says March 6 2016 at 509 pm Well if thats what youre looking for. Its a newspaper and its reviews tend to provide context about how the films got made and what responses they are likely to get in their intended markets.

That the producer in this case happens to be a woman doesnt significantly alter this storylines trajectory and thats one of the films smart satisfying strategies. Based on Kim Barkers memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" the film gives Tina Fey her strongest big-screen role to date. There are some Liz Lemon elements to the character -- Kim is a cubicle drone stuck in a safely repetitive job and a similarly go-nowhere relationship -- but she comes into her own on the front line navigating the madness of the War on Terror and covering breaking news instead of drafting copy about yet another story on the dangers of high fructose corn syrup. See Video Tina Fey Margot Robbie Report From Afghanistan in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Trailer The only reason Kim gets shipped to Kabul in the first place is because shes one of her (unnamed) networks news staffers without a spouse or children -- a revelation that brings one of her co-workers to tears -- and while Kims initially wet behind the ears she quickly learns to navigate both the battlefield (via no-nonsense Marines general Billy Bob Thornton) and the corridors of power in the ""Ka-bubble"" (as represented by lecherous bureaucrat Alfred Molina). Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") and screenwriter Robert Carlock (Feys ""30 Rock"" co-creator) embrace both the excitement and the absurdity of the war correspondents plight from the mixture of camaraderie and back-stabbing that develops among journalistic competitors to the epic booze-fueled blowing off of steam in which people in crisis situations tend to indulge. (One imagines the filmmakers watching ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" and taking extensive notes.) Also Read Tina Fey Signs First-Look Deal With Universal Hires Girls Writer for You Bet The dialogue is fast and darkly funny - ""Its all about hearts and minds - the two best places to shoot people"" one Marine tells Kim - and while our heroine falls for a fellow reporter (played by Martin Freeman) ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" refuses to bog down in a love story. Neither does it suggest that Kims increasing desire to be where the action is somehow negates her femininity. Covering the Taliban as a woman of course presents a unique set of challenges particularly when a crowd of angry men turns on a burqa-clad Kim whos filming a public rally where clergy shoot at televisions. Theres a strong case to be made that the roles played by Christopher Abbott (a scene-stealer as Kims sensitive locally-based translator) and Molina should have been played by more ethnically appropriate actors but both men deliver solid performances that resonate in spite of those casting decisions. The acting is universally excellent particularly Fey whos shrewdly fulfilling our expectations while playing off them. Also Read Geoff Stults to Star in Tina Feys CBS Comedy The Kicker Also worth a mention is Margot Robbie whose gorgeousness supports an amusingly pointed plot element that recalls the cynical trajectory of ""Broadcast News"" and she continues to make her mark as a sure-footed character actor. Coming off her powerful and underseen turn in ""Z for Zachariah"" -- as well as her hilarious bathtub cameo in ""The Big Short"" -- Robbie scores again with a supporting role as a rival correspondent who welcomes Kim as an all-too-rare fellow female covering the Taliban. Its tricky to locate a comedy in the middle of a war zone but cinematographer Xavier Grobet splits the difference accurately capturing the sun-baked deserts and shadowy alleyways without rendering the atmosphere so bleak as to elicit despair. Tonally its in keeping with Carlock and the directors finessing of dry wit out of tense environs and the films success comes out of never veering too far toward either extreme. Its wiser than the confusion its title suggests and it pushes Fey toward a film career thats as uncompromising unpredictable and intelligent as her TV work.
