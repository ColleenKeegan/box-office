Paltrow is Catherine the 25-year-old daughter of a formerly brilliant but latterly senile Chicago maths professor (Anthony Hopkins) who takes her fathers death badly. The subsequent discovery of an unpublished brilliant maths paper raises the question of whether it was written by Catherine or by her late father. Her more worldly sister Claire (a good turn by Hope Davis) is certainly doubtful of her sisters sanity - let alone her mathematical abilities. Im told the original play was more ambiguous (and so more interesting) but theres nothing to report here beyond a worn-out inert portrayal of the boundaries between madness and genius. A road well-travelled.

"Math Appeal washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Math Appeal Gwyneth Paltrow (with Jake Gyllenhaal) gives a commanding performance as a math whiz fearing madness in ""Proof."" (Miramax Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Nelson Pressley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 23 2005 The last time John Madden directed Gwyneth Paltrow on-screen the occasion was ""Shakespeare in Love"" in which the pleasures of straight theater looked like sheer adrenaline-fueled bliss. Its logical then that the next cinematic act from the Madden-Paltrow tandem should be ""Proof"" an actual Tony- and Pulitzer-winning drama. And its pretty ironic that Madden whose films tend to be handsome but conventional now tries to hide the fact that hes filmed a play. Its okay that his masquerade doesnt entirely work. ""Proof"" David Auburns drama about a math whiz who fears shes losing her mind has a tidy four-character construction that reeks of the modern stage even though Madden and the screenwriters -- Auburn and Rebecca Miller Arthurs daughter -- find small ways to make the story less housebound. (Onstage it all took place on a Chicago back porch.) The filmmakers even add a penny ante car chase in which love interest Jake Gyllenhaal runs after a vehicle thats whisking Paltrow away. For the most part though they stick to what made ""Proof"" a success in the first place an involving story bright logic-driven dialogue and a killer role full of wit and suffering for an actress who can radiate star power through layers of grubby depression. ""Proof"" brings Paltrow back to ""Sylvia"" territory Her character Catherine is whip smart and miserable which Paltrow registers with supple flickers of hope and dread. (Maddens camera hovers close to his star not wanting to miss a nuance.) Her performance is layered in grief and shes less wry than stage Catherines have tended to be -- the character throws off random lively sparks that Madden and Paltrow are content to leave muted but that keeps the audience in tune with the significant fact that Robert Catherines math genius father has just died. Mentally Robert went round the bend years ago and this effectively doubles his daughters anguish. Catherines offhand facility with tricky Germain primes (prime numbers that equal 2p+1; no further questions please) seem to be proof that Catherine has Daddys brains. The trouble is that those brains seem to be congenitally diseased. And therein lies ""Proofs"" resonance and fascination -- the threat of madness and the unsettling effect it has on an apparently brilliant woman whose life hasnt really begun. Robert haunts his daughter in the best and worst ways and it feels like a luxury to have Anthony Hopkins playing the part applying his mastermind facilities not to psychopathic cannibalism but to world-class math. The intellect reels forward then hits a wall and the eyes go blank. No wonder Catherines terrified of her future. Less rich are Auburns two supporting figures Claire (Hope Davis) and Hal (Gyllenhaal). Claire is a thinly drawn foil right down to her name Where Catherine is understandably rumpled older sister Claire is all clarity from her snappy wardrobe to her practical if heartless scheme to sell the family house right out from under Catherine. (Thanks goodness for Davis who handles the part with the lightest possible touch.) As Hal a former acolyte of Roberts Gyllenhaal looks great and you feel good for Catherine that a kindly hunk has come her way. But a plausible budding math prof at the University of Chicago he aint. Still the balance of ""Proof"" is positive. Auburns dialogue is professional and clever as is the plot about a major new proof found in Roberts desk which leads to an urgent question of who wrote it and which demands that Catherine and Hal prove themselves to one another in particular ways. And Paltrow is pretty commanding even if Madden pushes things toward airlessness by keeping the camera so tight. The anguish on that lovely haggard face -- youre right there with her yearning for the moment you both can finally breathe. Proof (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for a grad school milieu that includes drug references a drunken love scene and intermittent foul language.

(AP Photo/Chuck Hodes) In this photo provided by Miramax Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins star in ""Proof"" based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Auburn. (AP Photo/Chuck Hodes) Photo Miramax Films/ Am I crazy or just a brilliant mathematician? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Proof Drama. Starring Gwyneth Paltrow Jake Gyllenhaal Anthony Hopkins and Hope Davis. Directed by John Madden. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Somewhere in the translation from stage to screen David Auburn s powerful Pulitzer Prize-winning play was transformed into a goopy Gwyneth Paltrow movie. Its not for us to dwell on the shame of it how years from now no one will remember the play only this drab little movie; nor is it for us to speculate on what was probably a painful series of compromises a thousand cuts that led to this sad result. Ours is merely the pathologists role There it is on a slab. Its dead. Why? The lifelessness of ""Proof"" can be ascribed to a number of causes with most of them coming under two general categories. The first is that it required Paltrow to play an emotionally tormented woman something that by now can be safely said to be outside her sphere. In ""Sylvia"" Paltrow tried to play Sylvia Plath a brilliant suicidal poet with a gift for anger but came across as a placid young lady who in a pinch could probably pen a decent limerick. In ""Proof"" she plays another gifted eccentric a mathematical prodigy who is afraid she might be going mad. Once again she comes across as placid and anything beyond long division would be a stretch. No Paltrow doesnt seem dumb. Not at all. She just doesnt seem loony not remotely. She lacks a doorway into madness and so her only means of playing emotional torment is to play a mood. Called upon to play someone who might be going crazy she depicts sullenness sadness indifference or anger. Theres no sense of a skewed perception no suggestion of a frighteningly distorted and isolating world vision. Sometimes shes sad sometimes really sad sometimes flat-out depressed and sometimes shes irritated about it. Thats the range. The other big problem with ""Proof"" is the filmmakers strategy for ""opening up"" the film of taking it from stage to screen and making it seem more like a movie and less like a play. If director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") wanted to open up ""Proof"" -- and that wasnt necessarily required -- he might have done so with enthusiasm and in ways that added to the audiences experience and understanding of the work. Instead we get short meaningless soundtrack interludes with shots of Paltrow riding her bicycle. Such moments not only add nothing but they actually hurt interrupting the flow and putting a drag on the dramatic momentum. Then again Auburn who co-wrote the screenplay may have been ill-served from the beginning by his being paired with Rebecca Miller as his collaborator. Considering that Auburn already knew the characters hed written hed have been better off collaborating with a master of cinematic technique. Instead he was paired with a prose writer whose sluggish adaptations of her own work bear a distressing family resemblance to this film. Like the play the movie version takes place a few days after the death of a great mathematician a genius who spent the latter part of his life under a cloud of mental illness. He is played by Anthony Hopkins and we meet him in conversation with his daughter Catherine (Paltrow) who is celebrating her 27th birthday. Catherine points out that hes dead and hes not offended mainly because his apparition is a figment of her imagination. The cast is rounded out by Jake Gyllenhaal as Hal a former graduate student pouring through the dead mathematicians notebooks; and Hope Davis as Claire Catherines sister who arrives for the funeral and makes it her mission to run Catherines life. Claire is the storys villain to the extent there is one though audience sympathy might have been more decidedly with Catherine if Paltrow didnt play her as such a drip. Thats a big problem with Paltrow not seeming nutty She inadvertently makes Catherine creepy. The screenplay adds a handful of small scenes most notably a funeral oration that reflects badly on Catherine and doesnt help the film. The movies title refers to a mathematical proof a breakthrough that is found inside the dead mans desk. Its authorship -- and whether it will ever be rightfully accredited -- are the sources of the drama though the films best scenes are the flashbacks and hallucinations in which Paltrow acts opposite Hopkins. Their father-daughter dynamic is convincing and even moving the one thing to take from the experience. -- Advisory Profane language and sexual situations.

Writers who must have failed calculus try to pump drama into dry algorithms with splashes of schizophrenia (""Proof"" the script at hand) mysterious CIA operatives (""A Beautiful Mind"" see also schizophrenia) and repressed child abuse (""Good Will Hunting""). Not very laughable subjects mind you but really does the number-crunching have to hurt so much? Next time I meet a math freak whos just an average nerd instead of certifiable Im going to buy him a new pocket protector. ""Proof"" goes even further than those other two math-related heart calipers by asking us to feel sorry for Gwyneth Paltrow who on her worst day on earth would still be the queen of the campus. Shes moping alone on her 27th birthday hiding unsuccessfully behind that golden mane as she flips channels through infomercials. Shes an unhappy math whiz mourning the death of her famous father. She is ""Shakespeare in Fractions."" Catherine gave up serious studies to care for her dying father played as Zorba the Geek by the always-emoting Anthony Hopkins. They holed up in their Chicago house making dirty dishes and solving math proofs as dad went slowly delusional. ""Proof"" opens at his death and Catherines bossy older sister (Hope Davis) arrives to run the funeral. The camera loves Gwyneths face but the writers dont give her much to work with. ""Proof"" is full of the kind of adult emotions demanded from junior high schoolers during counseling groups ""Id like to take some time to figure things out."" ""That is not what this is about."" ""Am I coming on too strong?"" ""Youre a mysterious person Catherine."" Catherine knows that all too well. She is so mysterious no one could possibly understand what shes gone through as she points out over and over. She is so mysterious that she can be unrelentingly obnoxious yet were supposed to love her anyway for being such a character. The drama meant to save or ruin Catherine comes from a little black composition book. Dads grad student played gamely by Jake Gyllenhaal rifles through a desk drawer and finds a math proof that would of course change everything except Catherines bad attitude. Since Dad was shedding decimals though and daughter is something less than a prime number herself its unclear who wrote the proof. ""Proof"" is a former hit stage play and here it comes off even more stagey than most movie adaptations. In a theater with the right actress ""Proof"" might have seemed a one-woman tour de force a loud cry for recognition and understanding. Flattened onto the screen though everybody always seems to be saying exactly the wrong thing to poor Gwyneth which gives her the right to be insufferable. The director injects fake tension with sudden rushes to the airport as if theres only one flight a month from Chicago to New York and with grad students running down the street to chase a departing car as if no one at the University of Chicago has managed to trust-fund themselves into a working vehicle. When Catherine/Gwyneth finally makes her dramatic summation her claim is nearly drowned out by ""Proofs"" overbearing soundtrack.

"Paltrows dramatic conviction is undeniably convincing in Proof - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Paltrows dramatic conviction is undeniably convincing in Proof By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 23 2005 Proof"" is proof that you can drain most of the juice out of a play and still have an enjoyable night at the movies. The film comes with all sorts of Good Housekeeping seals of approval David Auburns stage drama won a Pulitzer and a Tony in 2001 Sir Anthony Hopkins is on board as the ghost of the heroines father and John Madden is directing Gwyneth Paltrow for the first time since he helped her win an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love."" You dont need to wear evening dress to see the movie but it couldnt hurt.On stage Auburns play was a one-set two-act marvel concerning Catherine (here played by Paltrow) the morose bedraggled daughter of a recently deceased college mathematics professor named Robert (Hopkins). Daddy was a genius in youth and a paranoid schizophrenic for most of his adult life and Catherine is worried she may be next. She has spent so long caring for her father in their rattletrap off-campus house and so little time caring about her social life or physical appearance that she may as well be a genius herself.And so it turns out to be. Maybe. One of her fathers students a handsome self-confessed math geek named Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) comes across a handwritten proof among the professors effects that may rock the academic world. Were never told exactly what it is because were you know dumb but theres every possibility that it may be the work of the daughter rather than the father. Can the insistence of an unstable young woman be taken as its own proof? Or do matters of faith and trust enter into the picture?Proof"" in other words is a glib and well-written inquiry into Big Things and on that level its good entertainment. The whole genius-equals-madness calculus is older than old hat and so is the dad-was-crazy-and-I-may-be-too corollary -- Katharine Hepburn was treading these creaky boards in 1932s A Bill of Divorcement."" But even with that Pulitzer the play was never really about the ideas. Its about characters and acting and Paltrow honors that.Her Catherine is more strident more melodramatically messed up than was Mary Louise Parkers nearly adorable basket case on Broadway -- Paltrows is a movie performance and she gives every tremor of anger and doubt its own close-up. The rest of the cast stands back and lets her swing the cat Gyllenhaals Hal is conciliatory and concerned like an old-fashioned suitor with a high GPA and Hope Davis isnt able to make Catherines humorless sister Claire more than the dramatic convention she is. (Someone please break this actress out of the ghetto of purse-lipped supporting shrews.) Paltrows the whole show her eyes puffing with resentful tears and her nasal patrician voice fraying at the edges. To her credit she doesnt glamorize Catherine. To be blunt she doesnt have to -- shes Gwyneth Paltrow.Madden opens the play up as best he can -- he gets the cast off that front porch and into cars living rooms clothing boutiques -- but its still a yakfest; not that theres anything wrong with that. Filmmaker Rebecca Miller (Arthurs daughter) has also been drafted to help Auburn with the script to lesser effect A line like I feel like I could crack open like an egg or one of those really smelly French cheeses that ooze when you cut them"" has Millers gummy fingerprints all over it.In the end Proof"" isnt about proof or trust or mathematics or family so much as its about one deeply alienated woman trying to decide whether she wants back into life. Thats the drama of it and Paltrow supplies her own proof. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Proof Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2005) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/proof-2005,200,proof11,proof,rogerebert
"Proof | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; proof_940 ) Proof (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Maybe its my math/engineering background but I found Proof to be fascinating both on the stage and on the screen. Actually appreciation of the film demands little math knowledge (aside from recognizing that a ""proof"" is a logical set of equations designed to explain and defend the veracity of a theorem). Proof is less about math than it is about the ins-and-outs of intellectual property and the relationships of one women to those around her (father sister lover). When we first meet Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) its the day before her fathers funeral. During the last years of his life Robert (Anthony Hopkins) - once a revered mathematician - was caught in the grip of dementia with Catherine as his lone caregiver. Now with his death her sister Claire (Hope Davis) has jetted in from New York City to pick up the pieces and bring Catherine back with her. And her fathers dissertation student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) is poring over Roberts old notebooks looking for something brilliant amidst all the ramblings. Meanwhile Catherine who believes she may have inherited her fathers madness as well as his talent is slowly coming apart. Where is the line between madness and genius? Thats a key question posed by Proof but not the only one. By introducing elements of mystery and uncertainty it adds a sense of urgency to a topic normally reserved for dry seminars intellectual property. Or to put it another way when a radical proof exists without confirmed authorship to whom does it belong? The focus of the movie is Catherine. Is she going mad or is her erratic behavior the result of grief stress and the natural eccentricity of a genius? The screenplay co-credited to David Auburn (who wrote the play) and Rebecca Miller leans in one direction but allows the viewer to make the final determination. Its not clear-cut. Regardless of your position however you wont be able to deny the force and vibrancy of Catherines character. Gwyneth Paltrow once again working with director John Madden and reprising the role she played on the London stage is a powerhouse of raw emotion. (Oscar nomination?) This may be her most mature performance to date. Her trio of supporting players hits the right notes. The material is intellectual but the treatment is not. Proof is a stirring motion picture that challenges our views on a great many things about life some of which we take for granted. And by opening up the play Madden has made it less talky and more cinematic without losing the quintessential elements that made it such a success on stage.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Proof lives up to its powerful pedigreeBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY Proof proves undeniably that the intimacy of a stage play can be re-created powerfully on screen. Bound by responsibility Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal. Miramax Films Playwright David Auburn adapted his theatrical production and John Madden who directed the play in London is at the helm here which no doubt contributed to the success of the movie. The story focuses on four characters and all four actors give strong performances. But the standout is Gwyneth Paltrows emotional rendering of Catherine the dedicated daughter of Robert a mentally unbalanced mathematician (Anthony Hopkins). In her best performance to date Paltrow embodies the complex and vulnerable Catherine a loving daughter who like her father has a brilliant mind and an occasionally troubled psyche. Theirs is a singularly symbiotic relationship. Catherine has given up most of her own ambition to care for him. Consequently her feelings in the days just after his death when the movie opens are conflicted. About the movie Proof    Stars Gwyneth Paltrow Anthony Hopkins Hope Davis Jake Gyllenhaal Director John Madden Distributor Miramax Films Rating PG-13 for some sexual content language and drug references Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles As she tries to come to grips with her loss she is also fearful that she has inherited his insanity. She has a testy distant relationship with her brittle self-involved older sister played superbly by Hope Davis. Jake Gyllenhaal is Hal a mathematician and former student of Roberts who is convinced that he can unearth an amazing discovery among Roberts papers. With a Pulitzer Prize and Tony awards to the plays credit the stakes were high for the movie. But its themes of trust the depth of filial responsibility and concerns about genetic inheritances are explored with depth and intelligence. Paltrow who lost her father just before taking the role to the London stage anchors this weighty film. Hopkins performance though poignant in several scenes goes over the top at moments and Gyllenhaal might be too Hollywood-handsome to play a self-described math geek. The setting occasionally feels self-consciously stagey. But this is a moving portrait of an intense bond between a father and daughter an eloquent and resonant story about the ties that bind.

You know - the madness of genius the genius of madness.For a decade Paltrows Catherine had been caring for her famous mathematician father Robert (Anthony Hopkins) who spiraled into schizophrenia until his death. Now as his funeral approaches we are made to realize that she too is afflicted if not with madness then at least with the shadow of it. We see her first on the eve of her 27th birthday conversing rowdily with her departed father who pops up throughout the film as it jumps around in time.Roberts terse bluntness reveals a man who is going through the motions of sanity. Or is it that Hopkins is only going through the motions of acting? His performance is pallid. Perhaps the director John Madden was attempting to pit Hopkinss nothingness against Paltrows everythingness. Shes furiously overwrought from the start. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Madden previously directed Paltrow not only in ""Shakespeare in Love"" but also in a 2002 London stage production of ""Proof"" and he understands how to modulate her weepiness so that we can see the hurt and rage underneath. Paltrow has often been called upon to display her own actressy version of nothingness. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Although the Academy obviously disagrees I thought her Oscar-winning turn in ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a fluttery piece of by-the-numbers emoting. But Paltrow has occasionally mined a richer darker vein - in Paul Thomas Andersons ""Hard 8"" for example or in ""Flesh and Bone"" where she was convincingly rough-edged. Paltrow can seem so goddessy on screen - as if she had just stepped out of a shampoo commercial - that its jolting whenever she attempts something scabrous. In ""Proof"" she seems to be drawing upon a fund of real pain and it does wonders for the film which sorely needs wonderment.Auburns play as adapted by Rebecca Miller is primed to tackle weighty issues of insanity and art. (The mathematics in this movie we are made to feel is so elegantly complex that it qualifies as art.) ""Proof"" is also a drama about family ties that too tightly bind not only between daughter and father but between sisters Hope Daviss officious Claire arrives for the funeral with a gameplan to rescue her sister - who doesnt recognize she needs rescuing.And ""Proof"" is a species of love story too. Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) a former student of Roberts who is enamored of Catherine is sure that somewhere in the old mans 103 notebooks of dotty scribblings are vestiges of his former greatness. His sort-of love affair with Catherine is on a collision course with his ambitions to reinstate Roberts reputation.The love affair is the most engaging of these various elements perhaps because its the least pretentious. The byplay between Catherine and Hal captures the abrasiveness of a real relationship. Gyllenhaal who has an ardent openness here plays well with Paltrow who reveals herself to him in brief bursts.But at its highest level of ambition ""Proof"" fails to deliver. The film becomes a psychological whodunit where Catherine is shown to be either a martyr to her father or else his intellectual equal. None of it is terribly convincing.Although the filmmakers maintain the pretense that Catherine and Robert are individuals and not types its clear that their suffering has metaphoric weight. Genius has deranged them and yet without derangement there is no genius. This is why Claire comes across as such a fussbudget and why Hal no prodigy is made out to be so sane He is standing in for all us dullards who lack the inspiration to unlock the universe. In the world of ""Proof"" madness and creativity are one. Its a very old romantic notion; maybe its time to put it to rest. Grade B Rated PG-13 for some sexual content language and drug references.

In Proof Paltrow plays yet another young woman who is being gnawed at by termites of instability only this time out her performance rather than startling is merely competent earnest and overly familiar. Shes one more depressive mope in dirty lank hair and an oversize wool-knit sweater whining about how unfair the world is -- a character who for all of her meticulously embedded quirkiness borders on type. On the eve of her 27th birthday Catherine (Paltrow) the heroine of David Auburns thin if celebrated Broadway play is a nervous stammering misfit wallflower who has spent most of her adult life caring for her brilliant mathematician father. Robert played by Anthony Hopkins in snowy white hair and beard with an avuncular manner of brainy excitement did revolutionary work in his early 20s and then suffered a massive breakdown; he may have been institutionalized. He has maintained a casual on-and-off relationship with reality ever since and Catherine may or may not have inherited both her fathers tendencies his genius and his insanity. Proof has been reworked for the big screen with restructuring and added dialogue by Auburn and Rebecca Miller and the director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) has opened up the action so that it now flows through airports and Armani boutiques and bustling university corridors. Yet Proof remains one of those clever facile plays that tries to be ambiguous and tidy at the same time. Its like The Glass Menagerie rewritten by Aaron Sorkin. The movie opens just after Roberts death when Catherine still living in her fathers messy book-laden cocoon of a college-town clapboard house plays host to two visitors both of whom she regards in her muzzy paranoia as intruders. Theres Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) a handsome young grad student who studied under Catherines dad and is now looking through his notebooks searching amid the psychotic scribblings for any lost nuggets of mathematical theory he may have left behind. The aspiring prof also plays drums in a rock band which allows the movie to include at least a scene or two that consists of something other than dolefully dry debate. Then theres Claire (Hope Davis) Catherines sister a New York yuppie who in her patronizing desperation to save her sibling would like to neaten up every loose end within reach including...Catherines hair. The two have a conversation in which Claire pushes the wonders of jojoba a substance Catherine has apparently never heard of. Its the sort of pointed stage dialogue that revolves around overly ordered dichotomies chatty well-groomed consumer princess versus morose unkempt academic beatnik. Yet all I could think was Is Catherine so out of it that she has never even glanced at the label of a shampoo bottle? Proof flirts with hefty themes yet too often it barely tethers them to a recognizable lived-in world. Nosing around Roberts notebooks Hal doesnt find a lot at least not until Catherine directs him to a solitary notebook in a locked desk drawer. It contains a visionary proof a theorem of more than 40 pages that could be the proof as well of Roberts restored sanity. Yet did he write what was in the notebook or was it Catherine herself? And if she wrote the proof is it also proof that she inherited his gifts or confirmation that shes doomed to repeat his slide into madness? The link between higher mathematics and mental derangement had genuine resonance in A Beautiful Mind but in Proof the connection is far too axiomatic. Auburn withholds key information about his characters then passes off the missing puzzle pieces as ""mystery."" In flashback Hopkins plays Robert as a saint of knowledge desperate to get ""the machinery"" -- his grasp of higher numerical systems -- working. His instability on the other hand is portrayed in a cut-rate fashion. Paltrow speaking in a dishrag whimper works to give Catherine a tremulous vulnerability but she lacks the obsessiveness of a numbers-driven personality. The movie turns the issue of who authored the proof into a gimmicky diminished game of did-she-or-didnt-she? Its hard to quarrel with the way Proof depicts mathematical genius as an unknowable abstraction. Otherwise we might need advanced degrees to watch it. If only the film didnt carry that same intellectual shorthand over to its portrayal of mental illness as though insanity were a light switch that could be flipped on or off. Proof is watchable but second-rate the minds it depicts too finite to be beautiful.

John Madden has woven together an intelligent drama of a breed increasingly rare in mainstream movies. Whether or not a significant audience exists for it will depend greatly on awards season attention. Constructed with the artful mathematical precision that dances through the unstable but gifted minds of its father-and-daughter protagonists David Auburns ""Proof"" -- perhaps inevitably -- was more beguiling and intimate on stage than on screen. But despite less-than-ideal casting of the male roles and a tendency to soften the Pulitzer Prize-winning works thorny humor with a more sober tone director John Madden has woven together an elegant intelligent drama of a breed increasingly rare in mainstream American movies. Whether or not a significant audience exists for it will depend greatly on awards season attention likely to center on femme stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Hope Davis. Those unfamiliar with Auburns 2000 play will draw comparisons with ""A Beautiful Mind"" which shares a focus on the fine line separating madness from genius as illustrated in a mathematician -- in this case two. However ""Proof"" is a far more subtle exploration of similar issues without the biopic backbone or the sentimental payoff of the Ron Howard film and therefore without the easy audience hook. But in the troubled character of Catherine -- played previously by Paltrow on the London stage in a Donmar production also directed by Madden -- it has a complex and hauntedly magnetic central figure. The 27-year-old daughter of groundbreaking mathematician Robert (Anthony Hopkins) who slid into dementia long before his death Catherine feels the brooding shadow of her own tenuous sanity as she prepares for her fathers funeral. Intrusions into her depressive cocoon come via Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) a former student of her fathers now teaching math at the University of Chicago and her sister Claire (Davis) who breezes in from New York proffering coffee bagels and jojoba conditioner as pick-me-ups. Hal insists on combing through Catherines fathers hundreds of notebooks in the hope of finding lucid work amid the disjointed graphomaniacal scribblings. He also persists in trying to get closer to the borderline paranoid woman. Catherine lets down her guard when they sleep together after a post-funeral party. She hands Hal the key to a desk drawer where a notebook is hidden containing a proof of a mathematical theorem that could prove a revolutionary discovery. Creating the illusion of a far weightier drama Auburns sleight of hand was particularly deft onstage in regard to the plays two chief revelations the first that Catherines conversations with her father are in reality with his ghost; and the second concerning the author of the proof. Those plot points lack the element of surprise in the film that the theatrical bracketing of a scene change can heighten. Mostly the play makes only slender gains by being opened up. Daniel Sullivans original production unfolded entirely on the ample porch of the familys house. Madden keeps much of the action there; excursions to the college campus or a department store add little beyond the visual depth of Alwin Kuchlers sleek and graceful widescreen lensing. One of the more successful elaborations is Catherines speech at the funeral. Despite its forays into the arcane world of mathematics this is a family drama and it works best when rooted in the rundown home that Claire wants to sell out from under Catherine. Questionable choices in the casting of Robert and Hal somewhat dull the balance of this four-character piece. Making Robert British to accommodate Hopkins was fine but its a bland characterization too indistinguishable from his other muted unsatisfying turn as an academic in ""The Human Stain."" Only in his final scene in which anger deflates into the realization that his perceived productivity is in fact inane rambling do we really feel something for Hopkins Robert. Gyllenhaal achieves a good balance of sensitivity with a possible opportunistic agenda while also revealing the dulled awareness of a guy who knows hes not quite talented enough to dazzle in his chosen field. But hunky Gyllenhaal is probably no ones idea of a math nerd; his excitement at being part of a possible breakthrough mathematical discovery never quite sits right on the physically confident actors handsome puppyish features. Likewise actually seeing the band in which he and his math cohorts play and making them a relatively cool ensemble kind of kills the joke of party-animal theoreticians. Paltrow is entirely persuasive in a vulnerable performance low on vanity or showy moments. She makes Catherines sorrow her resentment and her fear of being her fathers daughter a vivid destabilizing force. Her crushed realization that her trust in Hal has been misplaced and then her slow reckoning that the same realization may also be unfounded are played with insight and economy. The films shift to a more somber tone from the play may be partly the influence of Auburns co-screenwriter Rebecca Miller as perhaps is the underscoring of Catherine as a woman almost numbed into complacency by the unlikelihood of achieving recognition in the boys club of math. One notable improvement in the screenplay is the amplified sense that Catherine perceives her own mathematical work as a potential source of shame to her incapacitated father bringing clarity to some of her more self-sacrificial behavior. Claire is a role that easily could be unsympathetic and one-dimensional but the always wonderful Davis softens her intrusiveness with genuine concern for her sister and with a touching understatement in conveying her awareness that the exceptional talents in the family gene pool went elsewhere. Maddens melancholy handle on the material is echoed in Stephen Warbecks lovely if somewhat overused score. Better in its gentle introspective moments than its sentimental ones the composers work often takes on the urgent obsessive mood of Philip Glass music which represents an apt sonic accompaniment to the ticking of the tormented mathematical minds at the dramas center.
