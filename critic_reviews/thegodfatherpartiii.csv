The telltale sum is at once generous and obscene Anyone who can afford to give this much is clearly not to be trusted. Yet Michael in his way is on the level. Having purged the Corleones of all their gambling operations hes now intent on converting the family assets into a legitimate business enterprise. Its not so much that Michael has gone soft as that hes tired. Even monsters need to sleep. Here as in the first Godfather we watch the Corleone family celebrating its prosperity its bonds the romance of family itself. The year is 1979 and Michael no longer married dances ceremoniously with his daughter (Sofia Coppola) a teenage flirt who looks more Old World Italian than he does. The scene is almost heartbreaking in its evocation of the wedding ceremony that opened the first Godfather. Even the Sinatra-like crooner Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) is on hand. Hes middle-aged now and pretty much taken for granted though watching him run through his golden-throated shtick one cant help but recall what had to happen -- remember that severed horses head? -- in order for him to hold on to his career. From its opening scenes The Godfather Part III has a curious and yearning aura of atonement. Michael is desperate to make up for his sins and so is Francis Ford Coppola who has spent the better part of two decades straining to live up to the achievement of the first two Godfathers -- perhaps the greatest fusion of artistry and popular success in the history of American movies. When Coppola signed on to direct Godfather III he wasnt simply agreeing to carry on the saga of the Corleones the Italian-American family who made organized crime seem at once horrifying and weirdly romantic. He was agreeing to revive the kind of richly detailed classical storytelling that has all but disappeared from the American cinema. The miracle is that he pulls it off. The Godfather Part III isnt the overpoweringly great movie the first Godfather was (lets be reasonable -- how could it have been?) and it lacks the bone-chilling gradations of darkness that made The Godfather Part II a singular American tragedy. This one is slower talkier and more prosaic two hours of exposition and 40 minutes of payoff. Whats more its narrative seams sometimes show. Yet by the end the movie has attained a deep-grained emotional grandeur that can hold its own with that of the other two films. For the first time since Apocalypse Now (1979) Coppola has recovered the gift of epic storytelling. Watching this flawed spellbinding end-of-a-dynasty epic I realized that the folly of Coppolas career during the past decade -- in films like One From the Heart Rumble Fish Peggy Sue Got Married and Tucker The Man and His Dream -- is that he willed himself into becoming a fantasist. The Godfather Part III marks his triumphant return to operatic realism. The film revives Coppolas career even as it brings Michael Corleones to a fittingly stark finale. Attempting to preserve and extend his empire Michael enters into a shady corporate deal with the Vatican negotiating with an amusingly cynical and worldly archbishop (Donal Donnelly) who drops bottom-line figures between puffs on his cigarette. It seems that the Vatican bank is in debt and could use a fast 600 million. If Michael provides it he can take over Immobiliare a world-wide real-estate company of which the Vatican owns a quarter share. But the plan is too good to be true. Standing in its way is a loose conspiracy of interests extending from a John Gotti-like celebrity gangster (Joe Mantegna) to one of Michaels most trusted cronies. Whats defeating Michael isnt merely a few greedy rivals but the Mafias eternal cycle of violence Michael wants out and it cant be done. Not helping matters is the emergence of Vincent (Andy Garcia) a fearless young punk stud whos the illegitimate son of Michaels late brother Sonny. Vincent is eager to join the family and Michael in part because his own son has rejected his criminal ways agrees to take him on. Yet right from the start its clear that this grinning shark in his black-leather sports jacket lacks the discipline -- the respect for his elders -- required to rise in the mob. Hes of the new nihilistic generation The Last Corleone. The story moves to Sicily and stays there becoming a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses. Coppola and coscreenwriter Mario Puzo have concocted a densely packed narrative that builds very slowly. The movie however is more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions. For Coppola is telling a story of emotional incest He shows us a family strangled by its own blood ties. Vincent falls into a queasily intense romantic involvement with his first cousin -- Michaels daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola). Meanwhile Connie (Talia Shire) Michaels sister has become in effect his surrogate wife a shadowy schemer who hatches assassination plots when her brother hasnt the will. Its the collective pull of these two -- the daughter and the sister -- that draws Michael back into the fray. Andy Garcia is as magnetic as ever yet Vincent has been made into a standard post-De Niro hothead. And so theres no way he can become as resonant a central character as this series demands. Coppola would have done well to make him a little smarter take him back to the U.S. and enmesh him in a booby-trapped gangster melodrama something to offset the more meditative goings-on in Sicily. Yet what Coppola has given us is in its own way richly satisfying. Pacino creates a towering portrait of a man torn between his dreams and his guilt. Michael longs for redemption yet ends up losing everything he ever cared about. He has an impromptu confession scene that is at once searing and tender and Coppola and Puzo borrowing liberally from headlines about the Vatican scandals of the late 70s add a brilliantly blasphemous zinger by having his father confessor turn out to be the cardinal who is later chosen as the new pope. Talia Shire who has never been that interesting an actress gives the performance of her life playing Connie with the dark stealth of a Mafia Lady Macbeth. And Eli Wallach is superb as an aging don whose grandfatherly kindliness is revealed to be a mask of treachery. As for Coppolas 19-year-old daughter Sofia shes obviously a nonactress yet her Valley Girl nonchalance is apparently just what the director wanted. Coppola is saying that in a mass-culture age even the daughter of a titan is as much a product of the world around her as she is of her family. The movie culminates in a brilliant 30-minute-long set piece with Coppola cutting between several related assassinations and the opera that most of the instigators are attending. Its one of the most complexly layered suspense scenes ever filmed a kind of slow-motion Hitchcockian roller coaster. The weapons range from guns to poisoned cannoli and one of the assassinations -- a kamikaze attack on a mob boss -- is more hauntingly horrific than anything in the first two Godfathers. With this sequence Coppola unveils a vision of corruption that embraces the entire world. Yet hes also reveling in sheer theatrical magic in a way that only a master can. The entire sequence -- indeed the very movie weve been watching -- becomes pure opera as Coppola rediscovers his voice.

The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity epic scope socio-political analysis physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu. In addition the 55 million-plus production is the most personal of the three for the director. Like the original Part III opens with a lengthy festival celebration punctuated by backroom dealings. It is 1979 and Michael Corleone having divested himself of his illegal operations is being honored by the Catholic Church for his abundant charitable activities. Hopeful of bringing his family closer together Michael dotes on his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) and understandably becomes perturbed by her affair with cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia) hot-headed violence-prone illegitimate son of Michaels late brother Sonny. Vincent has been unhappily working for slumlord and old-style thug Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) who has taken on Michaels less savory holdings. Bad blood between the ruthless Zasa and the Corleone family mounts just as Michael tries with 600 million to buy a controlling interest in the European conglomerate Immobiliare a move that would cement his business legitimacy and financial future. After 80 minutes the action switches to Italy where it remains for the duration. Pacino and Eli Wallachs old dons cant help begin scheming against one another. In one of the most masterful examples of sustained intercutting in cinema the performance on opening night of Pacinos son in Cavalleria Rusticana serves as the backdrop for several murderous missions. For the third time out in his career role Pacino is magnificent. Garcia brings much-needed youth and juice to the ballsy Vincent heir apparent to the Corleone tradition much as James Caan sparked the first film and Robert De Niro invigorated the second. Diane Keaton proves a welcome if brief presence in warming the film and Talia Shire seems pleased with the opportunity to do some dirty work at long last. Films main flaw unavoidably is Sofia Coppola in the important but not critical role of Michaels daughter. Unfortunate casting decision was made after original actress Winona Ryder had to bow out at the start of production. [In 1991 Paramount released a 170-min.

Comments (1) The Godfather Part III Francis Ford Coppolas tragic and worthy (if uneven) conclusion to his Godfather trilogy (1990) which he wrote in collaboration with Mario Puzo represents a certain moral improvement over its predecessors by refusing to celebrate and condemn violence and duplicity in the same breath or at least to the same degree. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino at his best) seeks absolution for his past sins and although a cardinal grants it at one point (in a powerful confession scene) the film itself refuses to. While some of the allegorical implications persist (crime equals capitalism Mafia equals family both equal America) the decline of America in a world market where both European money and the Vatican are made to seem as corrupt as the Corleones leads to an overall change of focus. The episodic construction yields a strong first and third act and a sagging middle and one regrets the absence of Robert Duvall whose character provided a crucial link between crime and business in the first two parts.

"The Godfather Part III (R) The Godfather Part III (R) By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer December 25 1990 Francis Ford Coppolas ""The Godfather Part III"" isnt just a disappointment its a failure of heartbreaking proportions. Admittedly ""The Godfather"" I and II which are universally acclaimed as among the greatest works of the American cinema are a tough act to follow; a very good film might be put alongside them and still not measure up. ""Godfather III"" though adds little more than a sad footnote to those earlier works. The film completes the story of Vito Corleone and his sons bringing us from the point at which the second film ended to the present day from that image of an isolated Michael (Al Pacino) looking out from his boathouse office as the orders for his brothers murder are executed to the anticlimactic ending. But in supplying the final chapter of the saga it also sullies what came before. It makes you wish it had never been made. Coppolas star has dimmed significantly over the 16 years since the last ""Godfather"" film but to see this third installment is to watch it fall out of the sky altogether. ""The Godfather Part III"" is the work of an artist estranged from his talent a lost soul. In continuing the story of the Corleones not only does Coppola fail to build on what he and his screenwriter Mario Puzo previously created; he also seems oblivious to what had made his story so compelling to begin with. The characters that carry over from the earlier films bear little resemblance to themselves. The dread curve of Michael Corleones life which provided a dramatic spine for the family saga has lost its sinister bend. At the beginning of ""Part III"" Michael has come very close to realizing his dream of a completely legitimate family business. At a ceremony in his New York penthouse he receives the Order of St. Sebastian from the Catholic Church a lofty honor that may be connected to the 100 million donation given to the church by the Vito Corleone Foundation a charity run by Michaels daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola). But this first act doesnt have the dramatic resonance of the wedding scene in ""Part I"" or the celebration of Michaels son Anthonys first communion in ""Part II"" because Michael no longer sits like a malignant spider at the center of his Mafia web. Michael is a businessman now and in divesting himself of his criminal interests he has lost what made him interesting his murderous darkness. Its nearly impossible to see how the relentlessly brutal middle-aged man at the end of ""Part II"" could have grown into the relaxed polished easy-moving older one we see here. In some scenes -- like one in which he urges Vincent (Andy Garcia) his brother Sonnys hotheaded bastard son to make the peace with a rival Joey Zaza (Joe Mantegna) -- he seems almost charming -- a smiling glad-handing lightweight. The action here takes place past the point where there is anything at stake and it has at times an almost meditative quality an old mans summing up. With Michael missing from the films center the rest of the action seems ungrounded; it loses its moral dimension and becomes just another mob story. The two main plot threads concern the Corleone familys dealing with the Vatican and Vincents emergence as Michaels successor. The motives for Garcias Vincent arent split the way Michaels have been. Violence is natural to him. He suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his familys behalf and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way Don Vito Corleone was. Garcia as a result seems to be the only actor in the film who knows what hes playing the only one with a clear mission and he gives a thrilling feral performance. Its the films strongest. Pacino for his part flails around inside his character. His makeup is superb though if he had been allowed to sweep back his hair it might have connected him physically to Garcia (and to Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro as well). Sometimes his choices are intriguing and at times he draws something interesting to the surface of his performance. For the most part though he busies himself by paying attention to the details of playing an older man -- Michael is around 60 -- and goes not much deeper than that. Some of Coppolas choices -- for example having Michael collapse suddenly into a diabetic coma when it was never mentioned that he suffers from the disease -- appear to have been made out of desperation. And some of the plotting -- particularly the handling of a conflict between the Corleones and the Luchese family over control of the Vaticans massive corporate holdings -- is tangled beyond comprehension. Some scenes -- such as the ones with Diane Keaton as Michaels wife Kay -- are in the film because of studio politics and not because Puzo and Coppola have anything of importance to say in them. Even though she is authoritative in the role Keaton suffers tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past sins. (Shes also anchored with some of the films most painful dialogue.) Eli Wallach has a few hammy moments as Don Altabello an old mob friend who turns out to be an enemy. Bridget Fonda who plays a journalist has only two small scenes that contribute nothing whatsoever and George Hamilton contributes a few atrocious moments as the familys PR man. Talia Shires part as Michaels sister Connie has been expanded in ""Part III"" but the conception for the character seems to vary from scene to scene so that at one moment shes a screaming crackpot and the next a power-hungry behind-the-scenes plotter. The romance between Mary and Vincent is one of the films main subplots and as Mary Sofia Coppola is hopelessly amateurish. Still the part is a relatively small one and her failure -- contrary to much that has already been written -- contributes very little to what is actually wrong with the film. It may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here he had nothing more to say. As an epic metaphor for the American dream the first two ""Godfather"" films are nearly perfect. The connections they made go deep into the story of this country deep into our sense of ourselves and the contradictions in our lives. As a generational story they had the richness and scope of Shakespeare. But the man who made those two masterpieces is not the man who has given us this failed final chapter. Though he reassembled many of the members of his old team -- his actors Puzo cinematographer Gordon Willis and production designer Dean Tavoularis -- his talent for filmmaking is eclipsed now by his gift for self-destruction. If that great earlier artist ever had a chance of resurfacing it was here. But he didnt and you cant help but see ""The Godfather Part III"" as his headstone. ""The Godfather Part III"" is rated R for violence.

That it proved unable to fulfill expectations was a predictable - if somewhat disheartening - result given the sixteen year buildupThe Godfather Part III is a good movie with moments of rare power but it is not a great one - a reason why many fans of the series have voiced their disappointment. Oscar nominations for this film were probably based more on the Godfather name and reputation than on the particular merits of this production. Part III became the first Godfather not to take best picture and despite a deserving performance Al Pacinos efforts were not acknowledged. The lack of awards enthusiasm perhaps reflected a general opinion. The story opens in 1979 New York some twenty years after Michael Corleone (Pacino) gave the order to have his older brother killed. His children Mary (Sofia Coppola) and Anthony (Franc DAmbrosio) are now grown. Mary is devoted to her father; Anthony is more wary. He loves Michael but wants nothing to do with ""the business"" even though all illegal investments have been divested. The Corleone family is legitimate. As with the other two movies this one begins with a family gathering. The occasion is the presentation to Michael of the Order of St. Sebastian - the highest honor the Catholic Church can bestow upon a layman. For a Corleone to receive it is the ultimate mark of respectability. Michael is not so easily free of his former underworld allies however. When he makes a 600 million play for the international conglomerate Immobiliare they want a piece of the cake seeing an opportunity to launder their money. Michaels refusal at a meeting of dons stings more than a few of his old friends and brings down a bloody retribution. The next Don Corleone - Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) Sonny Corleones boy - is awaiting his opportunity. He possesses a ruthlessness and taste for violence that Michael has long since lost and as the Immobiliare stakes escalate the old head of the family recognizes the need for youth and strength. The passing of the baton however carries with it a tragic price. One of the most obvious problems with The Godfather Part III is that it covers little new territory. The plot is highly derivative of the original. This time Michael fills Vitos role and Vincent stands in for Michael. This method of too-obvious parallelism might have been more effective had Vincents character been better developed. That isnt the case however because Michael is still the focal point. As always Pacino is a delight to watch. The third time around he brings a mournful weariness to Michael Corleone. This is a man who has paid for all the wrong choices. Memories haunt him like ghosts that can never be exorcised. The emotional toll is shown in the stoop of his shoulders and the thickness of his voice. Family as has ever been the case is crucial to Michael. His children are his reason for living. In his words ""The only wealth in this world is children. More than all the money and power on Earth [they] are my treasure."" He says to Mary that he would burn in hell to keep her safe. It is a prophetic statement. Robert Duvall is missed. Its impossible not to feel the vacuum created by his absence. George Hamiltons B.J. Barrison is a one-dimensional necessity of plot not a ""real"" character. At least the decision was made not to replicate Tom Hagen in Barrison. Hamilton is given little more to do than stand in the background and speak a few lines. Another unfortunate casting decision was the choice of Sofia (daughter of Francis) Coppola as Mary (Winona Ryder the directors preference was prevented by fatigue from appearing). Coppola is pleasant enough to look at but her range is limited and that lack of ability diminishes several emotionally-charged scenes. This is the first Godfather to have a major role defined by a poor performance. One thing that is not inferior however is Francis Ford Coppolas directorial flair. The final half-hour with its interweaving of diverse-yet-related plot lines is choreographed with the skill of a master. There are moments of The Godfather Part III that shine with the brilliance of the previous two films. Despite its missteps The Godfather Part III packs enough of a punch to deserve a place alongside its predecessors. This is no poorly-conceived curiosity. Not only does the film bring Michael Corleones story to a conclusion but it remains faithful to the form and style of parts I and II. Taken as one grand epic with this chapter included the Godfather movies represent one of the most solid emotionally-rich tales ever committed to film.

The Godfather Part III Movie Review (1990) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-godfather-part-iii-1990,200,thegodfatherpartiii7,thegodfatherpartiii,rogerebert
"The Godfather Part III (R) The Godfather Part III (R) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer December 28 1990 There were these two great movies called ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II."" But this latest installment optimistically referred to as ""The Godfather Part III"" is one offer director Francis Ford Coppola should have refused. Perhaps antagonized by the universal acclaim of the first two films Coppola and original ""Godfather"" author Mario Puzo have overachieved in the wrong directions. They lay in so much plot detail its hard to keep track of whats going on. This story is mainly about aging don Al Pacinos attempts to redeem himself. But its cluttered up with blind-alley episodes and gratuitous Godfatherisms. ""Godfather I"" started with a family celebration and a shady backroom discussion. So does this movie. In the first movie Pacinos men took care of his rivals while he attended his childs baptism. In ""G-III"" he repeats the procedure only this time he goes to the opera. Former don Marlon Brando succumbed to a heart attack; his son and successor Pacino suffers a diabetes stroke. Whereas Brando had to keep hothead son James Caan in check Pacino has to keep the lid on impulsive nephew Andy Garcia. In the third installment theres another assassination attempt among vendor stands Al ""Spanish Eyes"" Martino sings again and someone complains of getting No Respect. They should have called this ""Seems Like Old Times."" The new movie is set in 1979 almost a decade since the events of ""Godfather II."" Pacino now in his 60s is on the up and up. Hes given up the murder business sold most of the family gambling interests and put his considerable money in banks and real estate. On the personal side he wants to rebridge the divide between himself and his family ex-wife Diane Keaton son Franc DAmbrosio and daughter Sofia Coppola. But he encounters resistance on every level. A consortium of Catholic businessmen (including Helmet Berger) fights his attempts to take over the Vatican bank. His son has defied Pacinos wish that he go into law choosing an opera career. Rash nephew Garcia (really the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone) has started a feud with gangster rival Joe Mantegna and to the godfathers chagrin has Italian eyes for daughter Coppola. These disparate strands which include trips to Rome Sicily and Atlantic City dont interweave so much as form a knot of confusion. Adding to that confusion is the movies mismatched tone. Its hard to tell if this things serious or parody and if it is parody whether or not its intentional. Is it a winky joke for instance to have lightweight performer George Hamilton as Pacinos business attorney or just ridiculous casting? Hamiltons performance points to the latter. And why really is Keaton in this movie? After not seeing Pacino for eight years her character shows up out of the blue only to spend her on-screen time tagging along with the action. Did she just want to be in the production? Talia Shires character change is another confusing element. Previously a demure Corleone sister she seems to have gone right over the campy edge with murderous enthusiasm. ""Do it"" she tells Pacino with beady eyes begging him to deep-six an opponent. ""Now theyll fear you"" she says later when a Corleone member is dispatched to kill an enemy. ""Maybe they should fear you"" retorts Pacino with a revulsion thats likely to induce the wrong kind of laughter. As the out-of-control ladies man and Pacinos budding next-in-line Garcias the best thing about this movie. But again is it intentional parody when he keeps popping people off and Pacino with an almost-farcical regularity keeps rapping his knuckles? ""Dont . . . ever . . . again . . . give that kind of order"" Uncle Godfather testily tells his nephew with all the serious depth of Moe in ""The Three Stooges."" This Pacino-Garcia relationship does lead to the best scene in the movie a cliffhanging (and of course bloody) climax at the opera. Involving rifle scopes silent stabbings in the audience and among many other things death by poisonous cannoli its classic ""Godfather"" fare. But a sweet dessert like this doesnt redeem all that stuff youve had to swallow before.
