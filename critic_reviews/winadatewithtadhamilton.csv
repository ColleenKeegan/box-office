Director Robert Luketic who broke through with the even bouncier ""Legally Blonde"" a few years back knows how to make this kind of material sing and though hes working with a screenplay thats never quite as witty as it wants to be his charming cast makes ""Tad"" a pleasant if undemanding journey. Rosalee (Bosworth) a Sandra Dee-ish blonde is a sweet-natured checker at the Piggly Wiggly in a small West Virginia town where she dreams of someday meeting her favorite movie star Tad Hamilton (""All My Children"" star Josh Duhamel). Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"" with Kate Bosworth Topher Grace Josh Duhamel Gary Cole Ginnifer Goodwin Sean Hayes Nathan Lane. Directed by Robert Luketic from a screenplay by Victor Levin. 95 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content some drug references and language. Several theaters. Fate Hollywood-style intervenes She wins a ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"" contest (concocted by Tads handlers concerned over his bad-boy image) and jets to L.A. for a chaste evening with the star. Upon meeting him she whimpers like a puppy so overcome that words desert her. Need I tell you that bad Tad who can whip off his sunglasses like an A-list star soon becomes enchanted by Rosalee and follows her back home to West Virginia convinced that her goodness can ""feed his soul"" and make him a better man? Or that quiet Pete (Topher Grace) her pal at the Piggly Wiggly has long been in love with her as well but was afraid to tell her -- and now that strapping Tad is on the scene Pete fears that he wont measure up? Or that Rosalee has a standard-issue best friend (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wears wacky clothes and supplies comic relief? Its all predictable stuff but played with a nice lightness. Duhamel who has that almost indecent breed of handsomeness thats common to soap-opera actors (his looks seem assembled by computer -- at home on a movie poster a little jarring in real life) grins and poses winningly. His Tad is a sweet guy if a little dim (he borrows dialogue from his movies to impress girls); his intentions are honorable. Its that kind of movie. Grace a young actor of impressive range (he was Erika Christensens druggie boyfriend in ""Traffic"") here has transformed himself into the perfect small-town good guy; hes like a more compact Brendan Fraser noble and just a bit nebbishy. Trying to save Rosalee from a hellish (well Tad-ish) fate he warns ""I bet hes slept with like 15 or 20 women"" and you can hear the pause in his voice; hes hesitant to relate such an appalling fact. And the ever-smiling Bosworth though she looks far more like a California girl than a West Virginia native is sweetness personified. Plenty of the jokes in ""Tad Hamilton"" dont quite work; Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes have little to do as Tads agent and manager and the fact that theyre both named Richard Levy falls flat. But enough of them register and enough goodwill is generated by the cast to coast the movie along. Its a pleasant fantasy downright cute in spots with a nice little message Everyone we learn is Tad Hamilton to someone. Awww.

Starring Josh Duhamel Kate Bosworth Topher Grace. Directed by Robert Luketic. Written by Victor Levin. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). A bad-boy actor (Josh Duhamel) out to rehab his image offers a date for charity. The winner a little ol gal from West Virginia named Rosalee (Kate Bosworth) turns out to be an accentless self-possessed stunner. She never even needs a makeover. Oh those celebrities and their selfless good works Bosworths (""Blue Crush"") ultrawhite teeth and chiseled cheekbones would not be so striking had ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" been made in the broad comic vein of ""Legally Blonde"" director Robert Luketics previous film. But the ""Tad Hamilton"" filmmakers aiming to please teens and adults -- and judging from the shirtless shots of Duhamel gay men of all ages -- have hedged their bets. Veering from throwback innocence to modern cynicism the movie is neither a compelling underdog story nor an especially funny romantic comedy. But it does have Duhamel. Hes always a pleasure to watch and not just because he benefits from the most flattering lighting since ""The Mirror Has Two Faces."" The TV heartthrob (""Vegas"" ""All My Children"") brings surprising nuance to an ostensibly shallow character a guy whos not really bad just caught up in his own celebrity. When Tad goes to West Virginia to bask in Rosalees realness he doesnt consider that she might be just another between-pictures diversion like Kabbalah. His business people (Sean Hayes and Nathan Lane the only actors here who seem to know theyre in an Elvis movie) keep pointing out his flakiness but Tad doesnt get it. Duhamel is an actor playing an actor whos not aware hes acting in his real life. Thats a lot of layers for a lark like this. Boswell has trouble with Rosalees down-home expressions as if shes embarrassed to say the words and with her characters tongue-tied awkwardness around Tad. A young woman this polished and good-looking whether from West Virginia or West Covina would certainly know how to behave around guys. Yet Rosalee is supposed to be a 22-year-old innocent who lives with her dad and hangs out with her two co-workers from the Piggly Wiggly. Bosworth has less chemistry with Duhamel than she does with Topher Grace who plays a co-worker and childhood friend secretly in love with her. The romantic triangle quickly hits a roadblock however in Graces character. The likable beanpole from ""That 70s Show"" does what he can but this guy is a pill. Immature and sarcastic he wont reveal his feelings to Rosalee but he will make snide remarks about the movie star and by extension Rosalees judgment. Tad always seems the better choice. Ginnifer Goodwin (""Mona Lisa Smile"") brings effervescence to her role as Rosalees other friend despite a disturbing character shift. In an early scene she and Rosalee watch Tad onscreen in a cheesy World War II romance. ""I wonder what hes doing right now?"" Rosalee asks dreamily. ""Hes probably at church"" answers the Goodwin character as if its really 1943. A couple of scenes later however the pal is propositioning Tad with some rather blue language. Somethings missing here. Like a transitional scene. ""Tad Hamilton"" has fun with the idea of celebrity invading a small town. The folks buzz over Tads arrival with the same fervor that might accompany a Louisiana pop stars quickie marriage to a local boy. Gary Cole (""Office Space"") the unrivaled deadpan movie comedian plays Rosalies father who at first seems unruffled by Tads arrival. Then we see that Dads trying to play the cool Hollywood insider wearing a ""Project Greenlight"" T-shirt and quoting net grosses. A shot of Cole reading Julia Phillips ""Youll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again"" wont mean a thing to teens but it will please Hollywoodphiles of a certain age.

Win a Date with Tad Hamilton Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton-2004,200,winadatewithtadhamilton7,winadatewithtadhamilton,rogerebert
"Date With Tad is not worth keeping - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Date With Tad is not worth keeping By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 23 2004 Its official The 1950s are back. ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" is as perky as that exclamation point in its title. Its also instantly forgettable a pleasant puff-pastry throwback to Sandra Dee movies ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and other pre-Beatles effluvia. Set in the here and now ""Win"" features a virginal heroine who says things like ""Shake-a-doo"" instead of the usual string of Anglo-Saxon exclamations and whose faith in true love falls slightly to the left of Gidget. Fourteen-year-old girls will find the movie enchanting. Your own response may depend on your tolerance for confectioners sugar.Director Robert Luketics last film ""Legally Blonde"" popped Reese Witherspoon loose as a major star and ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" may well do the same for his latest blonde Kate Bosworth. The actress has done solid work in ""Blue Crush"" and as Val Kilmers girlfriend in ""Wonderland"" but this movie offers her up on the half shell and she takes full advantage of it.Playing Rosalee Futch a West Virginia supermarket cashier who wins a dream date with a preening Hollywood man-hunk Bosworth radiates a genuineness and an open-faced optimism that transcend her Barbie-doll looks. Rosalees also fetchingly tongue-tied; when someone asks if he might give her a kiss she responds ""You might maybe may."" Shes an approachable goddess in a Piggly Wiggly apron and the script gives her just enough smart doubting dialogue to keep you rooting for her.Rosalee is the focal point in a romantic triangle whose other two vertexes consist of Pete (Topher Grace from ""That 70s Show"") the store manager and best friend who has loved her since childhood and Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel) the buff Tinseltown god who meets Rosalee on a PR-stunt date and sees in her all the honesty his shallow life lacks. (Rosalees lumpy wisecracking best friend Cathy played by Ginnifer Goodwin stands on the sidelines and makes lumpy wisecracks throughout.) ""Win"" zigzags from Fraziers Bottom W. Va. to the gleaming chic of Beverly Hills and back again after Tad follows Rosalee home in an effort to get in touch with both his soul and her body. Unbelievable? You must not be a 14-year-old girl.The films funniest moments belong to Grace who sputters with the trenchant cynicism of a burned romantic as Tad sweeps his girl off her feet along with everyone else in town. After Rosalee relays to him some of Tads endearments Pete turns to three locals at the check-out line and says ""Fellas show of hands Who here has used some variation of the `I dont want to ruin the friendship line?"" (Its unanimous.)Duhamel is serious eye candy and not much more as Tad; if heavy petting is as far as he and Rosalee go thats still enough to melt the braces of the films target audience. Gary Cole picks up some chuckles as the heroines movie-buff father but Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes seem to be visiting from another sillier movie as Tads agent and manager respectively both named Richard Levy.That joke and the tarter lines of dialogue are evidence of a cleverness that lies buried in ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" like crops in an unreaped field. Who ends up with whom is never remotely in doubt and Luketics uninspired direction rarely rises to the lightweight challenges of Victor Levins script; the movie evaporates off the screen as you watch it.What remains is Graces bitter wit and Bosworths bioluminescence as a big-hearted small-town girl of the sort found only in studio story meetings. Tad is expecting a pimply fan when he and Rosalee first meet; opening the door he exclaims ""Youre . . . pretty."" Well of course she is dummy; shes Kate Bosworth freshly minted Hollywood star. If theres irony there rest assured that no one involved with ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" seems aware of it.(""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" )Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Its a classic date movie but it also will appeal to pre-dating tweens and middle-aged romantics. The movies quirky wit keeps it from crossing the threshold into overly sentimental turf. (Related item Watch a clip from Win a Date With Tad Hamilton) Josh Duhamel is a Hollywood hunk in need of reputation rehab in Win a Date With Tad Hamilton Dreamworks Though the title character is a hunk with a killer smile the most appealing figure is the slightly off-center nice guy who we hope wont finish last. The handsome Josh Duhamel is Tad the self-centered movie star. Kate Bosworth plays West Virginia grocery clerk Rosalee Futch who is one of Tads biggest fans and Topher Graces Pete is Rosalees lifelong best buddy. To their credit the filmmakers dont paint Tad as a Hollywood weasel. He starts out superficial but essentially harmless so we can believe that down deep hes a decent fellow who yearns for some honesty and integrity in a business in which such traits are in short supply. Rosalees small-town fan could have been a dimwitted caricature or saccharine sweet but thanks to Bosworths fresh energy were convinced of her down-to-earth goodness as well as her crush on the dashing Tad. We also buy how the world-weary Tad might be drawn to the naively adorable Rosalee. About the show Win a Date With Tad Hamilton  (out of four) Stars Josh Duhamel Kate Bosworth Topher Grace Sean Hayes Nathan Lane Director Robert Luketic Distributor Dreamworks Rating PG-13 for sexual content some drug references and language Opens nationwide Friday Rosalee wins a trip to Hollywood engineered by Tads ultra-cynical agent (Nathan Lane) and slimy manager (Sean Hayes) in an effort to improve his bad-boy image. Besides having movie-biz slickness in common both of Tads handlers are named Richard Levy and both Levys are hilarious send-ups of Hollywood hucksters. As you might expect the movie industry is cleverly skewered in Tad Hamilton but so is rural America. One of the funniest supporting characters is Rosalees father played by Gary Cole who becomes so film-obsessed after his daughter begins dating a movie star that he reads trade publications and sports a Project Greenlight T-shirt. As good as Duhamel and Bosworth are audiences most likely will root for Grace who made his name on TVs That 70s Show. His self-effacing wit and clear-eyed love for Rosalee wins our hearts. After small parts in films such as Traffic and Oceans Eleven Grace establishes himself as a strong romantic-comedy lead with a quirky intelligence and boy-next-door appeal. Director Robert Luketic has a nimble touch with romance and an essential sense of comic timing which he also demonstrated in his first feature Legally Blonde. (He wisely turned down the leaden sequel.) Though some jokes fall flat and the ending is predictable the movie works because of the talents of its cast. For a good time make a date with Tad Hamilton.

"Win a Date with Tad Hamilton | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton ) Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli One reasonable way to judge a romantic comedy is to ask how strong a rooting interest the viewer has in the coupling that is destined to occur at the end of the film. In Win a Date with Tad Hamilton the desire is lukewarm. The central flaw here isnt the predictability of the plot (thats a given in any film of this genre) or the absence of crisp dialogue but the lack of conviction with which two of the three lead characters are presented. Its tough to develop a compelling romantic triangle when two-thirds of the participants arent being effectively ""sold."" The story which has more problems than promise could have been developed into an effective satire on the Hollywood system (and elements of that approach are in evidence) but director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) has elected to go in another direction. Instead of biting the hand that feeds him he has targeted the film as a teen date movie. It fills the niche efficiently but theres a scheduling issue Win a Date is coming close on the heels of two other movies aimed at the identical target audience Chasing Liberty and Along Came Polly. Time will tell if the box office can support three similar motion pictures released within a couple weeks of each other. Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth) is a checker/bagger at the local Piggly Wiggly grocery store in a small town in West Virginia. She and her best friend Cathy (Ginnifer Goodwin) are huge fans of movie stud Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel) so when a contest to win a date with him is announced online Rosalee enters - and emerges victorious. Thrilled by her luck she flies to California where she is treated to a magical evening with the star who seems to be everything she hoped he would be. For his part Tad although initially using the date as a publicity stunt to whitewash a tarnished image is intrigued by Rosalees innocence. Determined to change his life he pursues Rosalee back to West Virginia where he discovers that hes not the only one seeking to win Rosalees affections. Her other suitor is her long-time friend Pete (Topher Grace) who would easily have the upper hand except that he lacks the courage to make the necessary move. Kate Bosworth possibly best known for her star turn in Blue Crush was marvelous in Wonderland a movie that forced her to dig deep. (In my opinion she deserved a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for that portrayal.) The strength of her work in the sleazy 2003 film makes the vapidity of her performance here all the more discouraging. Bosworth fails to imbue Rosalee with anything more substantive than a wide-eyed innocence. Shes effective only in the scenes during which she is giddily anticipating winning the contest. As the object of two mens affection she lacks the appeal we would expect. Josh Duhamel does as little with Tad as Bosworth does with Rosalee. Part of that is the fault of the filmmakers who never see the mega-star as anything more than a gigantic complication in the Rosalee/Pete romance. However considering the amount of screen time he is accorded it would have been nice to see Tad escape (if only a little bit) from the stereotype into which he is shoehorned. A ""real"" Tad would have made for a stronger challenge to the Rosalee/Pete pairing thus giving Win a Date more of a kick. The only actor to give us a character worth caring about is Topher Grace whose self-deprecating Pete represents the kind of underdog that audiences always get behind. Best known for his part in ""That 70s Show"" Grace has a natural charm and charisma and comes across a little like a younger version of Robert Downey Jr. To the extent that we want the central romance to succeed its because of Pete not Rosalee. Had the movies focus been skewed more towards him than her the rooting interest would have been stronger. The films comedy is lackluster with supporting actors Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes (as Tads manager and agent) providing a few mildly amusing moments that would be at home in a sit-com. Director Luketic appears more concerned with developing the romance than generating laughs. For those who are looking for a mediocre teen date movie with a love story that it more obligatory than heartfelt Win a Date will do the job. But its far from a worthy or memorable way to chase away the late-January blahs.

A warm embrace of broadly humanely sketched characters plus some scrappy casting of rising young stars. Date movie will bring young couples in out of the chill for strong returns followed by sweet times in ancillary. As sweet-natured and unsure as its heroine ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" is a nice but inconsequential romancer that superficially addresses celebrity worship as a young West Virginia gal snags an evening with her favorite movie star. A warm embrace of broadly but humanely sketched characters plus some scrappy casting of rising young stars led by an incandescent Kate Bosworth help overcome the half-realized comedic situations. Date movie will bring young couples in out of the January chill for strong returns followed by sweet times in ancillary. With this follow-up to his first feature ""Legally Blonde"" director Robert Luketic is starting to corner the market on comedies centered on lovable if ditzy blond beauties. While Bosworths Rosalee Futch a naive fetching supermarket clerk momentarily seduced by Hollywood isnt the memorable creation summoned by Reese Witherspoon she refreshingly recalls a more innocent style of romantic comedy recently shoved to the sidelines by the gross-out showboaters. And for fans of Bosworths charismatic surfer chick in ""Blue Crush"" her softer side here reveals a young thesp with more than one dimension. Rosalee and her best pals Pete (Topher Grace) and Cathy (Ginnifer Goodwin) watch an imagined Hollywood romance titled ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"" and starring No. 1 heartthrob Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel). The gals are in tears and Pete checking his watch. Assumption that Hamilton is as nice off screen as on is abruptly contradicted by a cut to Tad indulging in a scandalous night that becomes tabloid fodder. Tads agent and manager both who are named Richard Levy (distinguished in credits as Levy the Driven played by Nathan Lane and Levy the Shameless played by Sean Hayes) nervously sense the need for their top client to regain his clean-boy image. They come up with a contest whose prize is a trip to Los Angeles and an evening with Tad. Meanwhile at the Piggly Wiggly in the West Virginia town of Fraziers Bottom Rosalee works with Cathy at checkout; Pete impresses as manager but cant manage to tell Rosalee he loves her. Both girls enter the contest for a date with Hamilton and Rosalee wins. Her arrival at the movie capital bears as little resemblance to the actual L.A. as pics depiction of West Virginia bears to the actual state and the movies overall phony sense of place (lensing was entirely and all too obviously in Southern California) depletes the comic energy and contradicts storys extolling of genuine feeling over false fronts. The date itself is a gently depicted meeting of a hunk whos in love with his own self-image and a distinctly non-city woman whos a bit tongue-tied but has a sharp built-in b.s. meter. Rosalee clearly leaves an impression on Tad who later impulsively shows up at the Piggly Wiggly to continue things with Rosalee. Pic is at its wobbliest in the midsection which shifts attention to Pete and his increasingly raging heart. Bosworths Rosalee moves offscreen in favor of Petes crisis and Victor Levins script struggles over the dramatic humps until a third act in which Graces irony-tinged perf as Pete begins to deliver some effective emotional notes. With immense good looks and the right polished airheadedness Duhamel is an inspired choice in his feature debut as a B.O. superstar. Grace doesnt overplay Petes contrast to Tads Olympian star appeal and his line deliveries are superbly timed even if the whole characterization verges on becoming terminally forced. As Bosworths sidekick Goodwin inserts some daffy touches although the fact that her Cathy also adores Tad suggests a seemingly natural clash with Rosalee thats never realized. Lane and Hayes leave only a faint comic impression as symbols of Hollywood cynicism while Gary Cole as Rosalees dad and Kathryn Hahn as the local love-wise barkeep steal their respective scenes. The bright and cheery look that distinguished Luketics ""Legally Blonde"" seems misapplied in this country/city tale especially combined with the continuously inauthentic settings. Pic stands as yet another puzzling example of how Hollywood regularly fails to depict itself accurately while bending over backward to avoid hick cliches. Edward Shearmurs underscore is the most subtle in a while for a youth-oriented comedy. Win a Date With Tad HamiltonProductionA DreamWorks Pictures release of a Lucy Fisher/Douglas Wick production.
