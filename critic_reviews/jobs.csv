Think You Might Like Jobs? Think Different. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 16 2013 831 PM Think You Might Like Jobs? Think different. By Dana Stevens Ashton Kutcher stars in Jobs. Photo courtesy of Glen Wilson/Open Road Films In the opening minutes of Joshua Michael Sterns Jobs the titular entrepreneur played by Ashton Kutcher addresses an almost disturbingly receptive audience from a sleek white stage at Apple headquarters. Its 2001 and hes telling them about a revolutionary new product the company is ready to launch. ""Its a music player"" he announces--and before he can even get to the part about how this new device will put a thousand songs in your pocket theres a chorus of oohs and aahs. Soon after before Jobs has demonstrated or even extensively described the capacities of the iPod he takes a small white rectangle out of his pocket and vaguely hoists it in the crowds direction as everyone assembled bursts into a boisterous standing ovation. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The disproportion between the impressiveness of Jobs presentation and the enthusiasm of the audiences response in that first scene is so marked you cant help but wonder whether what seems to be going on really is. (Not that factual accuracy is everything but its worth noting that the iPods actual reception at the time was far less rapturous.) Are we witnessing the triumphant unveiling of a world-changing product by a visionary inventor (a literal reading that the swelling music on the soundtrack would seem to ratify)? Or is this a deliberately exaggerated satire of sycophantic corporate culture or maybe of our cultures blind worship of tech entrepreneurship? Or wait--is Jobs only imagining that the crowd is cheering him so loudly? Is this some kind of dream sequence hes about to wake up from so that the real movie can begin? A few minutes in though as we flash back to a much younger Steve padding barefoot around the campus of Reed College all those bothersome queries about tone and point of view can be put to bed. It soon becomes clear that this is the real movie with scene upon scene that feels as flatly hagiographic (and curiously off) as that opening. Its a film whose plea to the audience resembles Jobs appeal to the crowd in that iPod-unveiling scene ""Believe this is important and exciting"" it asks ""because I say so."" Advertisement Whats frustrating about this approach is that so much of Jobs life story--not to mention the story of the literally world-changing devices he helped to invent--really was fascinating. His adoption by the Jobs family after being given up as an infant by his single mother (though his parents later remarried) and his later discovery of his sister the novelist Mona Simpson. His maladjustment to ordinary life whether at Reed where he dropped out and audited classes for free after six months or at Atari where he got his first job designing games and immediately gained a reputation as an anti-social unshowered smartass. His return to Apple as CEO after having been forced to step down in a humiliating corporate ouster. Jobs touches at least briefly on most of these developments (though not all--perhaps for legal reasons the fate of Steves birth parents and the existence of his long-lost sister are never mentioned). But the scene it returns to almost fetishistically is the one in which Jobs dazzles an adoring crowd (or sometimes just a few clustered acolytes) with the Zen-like simplicity of his vision. The dramatic core of Jobs--and one of the few real relationships in whats too often a one-man show of a movie--is the long working partnership between Jobs and Steve Wozniak the engineer who almost singlehandedly built the motherboard for the original Apple prototype. As played (quite wonderfully) by Josh Gad Woz is a squat cherubic tech geek with a passionate love for his work an unworldly type who would never suspect a friend of dissembling (as Jobs does) what a project pays in order to keep the lions share of the cash. The movies most entertaining stretch takes place in the late 70s when the young scruffy Jobs and Woz set up an operation too small to be called a startup out of Jobs fathers garage. Helped by some neighborhood gearheads they make a local computer-parts dealer a barely realizable promise to have a full shipment of hand-built computers ready in 60 days. In the car on the way to yet another fruitless meeting with a venture capitalist Woz and Jobs debate what to call their emerging company. Steve mocks Wozs suggestion ""Enterprise Computers"" for its Trekkie-ness but Steves first idea ""Apple"" is (true to this movies worshipful spirit) immediately hailed for its freshness and brilliance. The garage gang does eventually find its investor the retired tech millionaire Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) and the second half of the movie documents the relatively rapid rise of Apple from its humble origins to become a player (and eventually the player) in the emerging personal computer industry. Along the way we start to see Steve in a less flattering (though equally un-nuanced) light He impregnates his girlfriend (played by Ahna OReilly) then refuses to be any part of the childs life. He fires key engineers in fits of rage when they cant deliver on his impossible standards and deadlines. When the company goes public to wild success Jobs refuses to issue stock options to his college friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) whos been part of the Apple team since the start. Eventually Woz disillusioned by the way the company is changing regretfully tenders his resignation--and its suggested in the movies most touching scene desists from any hope of friendship with the increasingly remote Steve. The last act consists mainly of corporate drama around the 1985 firing of Jobs as CEO of Apple the subsequent appointment of John Sculley (Matthew Modine) and a series of other unsuccessful leaders in his place and finally Jobs triumphant return to the company in 1997. In a bizarre ellipsis all the events in Jobs personal life during this hiatus--including his marriage the birth of three children and his reconciliation with his estranged first daughter--happen off-screen so were abruptly presented with a portrait of Jobs as a mellow garden-tending family man without any hint as to what in his outlook or character might have changed to make that life possible. Jobs is so grievously misconceived from the ground up that the question of whether Ashton Kutcher is good in the lead role is difficult to answer. He certainly looks surprisingly like the iconic turtleneck-clad inventor especially when hes given the receding hairline and trim salt-and-pepper beard of Jobs later years. And he gets many of the gestures right including a distinctive stiff-armed walk that gets more stoop-shouldered as his character ages. In fact I would say that overall Kutcher acquits himself admirably especially when asked to do things no actor should have to--like blissfully air-conducting a Bach concerto that he hears only in his own mind while tripping on acid. But the Steve Jobs Kutcher plays in this movie isnt a recognizable human being with sufferings and motivations and fears and desires; hes a PowerPoint presentation of a man--a bulleted checklist of biopic cliches inspirational slogans and advertising taglines. The movie ends with a post-1997 Jobs in a sound studio reading some words into a microphone that most viewers will recognize Its the copy to the ""Think Different"" ad campaign that followed hard upon Jobs return to Apple. (""Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. ..."") Jobs voice quavers with emotion but the audience remains unmoved. We saw that Apple commercial already. It was a lot better than this one. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

"Jobs - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Jobs Posted by Christy Lemire on August 16 2013 12 Comments Open Road Films Rated PG-13 for some drug content and brief strong language. Running time 127 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. The irony in ""Jobs"" about the late Apple Computers co-founder Steve Jobs is not how a man could be so beloved and yet be such a bastard. The irony is that a man who treasured innovation and sleek stylish design should be the subject of a film thats so bland and bloated. Director Joshua Michael Stern has given us the worst kind of cursory biopic It spends a great deal of time recreating key events in a complex famous persons life without offering any real insight into what made him tick. (Jobs died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer at 56.) You would never know from watching ""Jobs"" thats its about a person who changed the way all of us live our lives on a daily basis. Im typing this review on my MacBook Pro for example and I just got a voicemail on my iPhone. This Steve Jobs operates in a vacuum in bedrooms and boardrooms in garages and generic office space. We know were in trouble from the very start; before heading into a lengthy flashback the film begins in 2001 with Jobs introducing the iPod to an enraptured audience of disciples at Apple headquarters. Its not enough to have them all leap to their feet in a frenzied standing ovation -- heavy-handed feel-good music swells to indicate to us that this is a major inspiring moment. As Jobs Ashton Kutcher basks in the applause in that familiar hunched-over stance in dorky dad jeans and wire-rim glasses his dark hair and beard now white. Kutcher has proven that theres more substance to him than the endearingly dippy persona of Kelso on That 70s Show"" and one of the ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" dudes would suggest. But despite being media-savvy himself he wasnt ready to portray a technological and cultural titan -- not just yet. Kutcher operates in two modes as Jobs Hes either quietly and mysteriously pondering his next groundbreaking project or hes loudly and cruelly berating anyone who dares question his vision. Then again Matt Whiteleys script doesnt give him much more to work with. Too often it feels like a repetitive series of meetings of middle-aged white men sitting around a conference-room table; at the other extreme it makes giant leaps in time and leaves important questions unanswered. Stern meanwhile adds nothing with really obvious musical cues as if loud 70s rock tunes with on-the-nose lyrics will create a sense of propulsive forward momentum. Cat Stevens ""Peace Train"" plays during Jobs acid-dropping college days; Joe Walshs ""Lifes Been Good"" with its distinctive guitar riff blares as Jobs and his pals put together their first computers. (I was however  happy to hear ""Walk on the Ocean"" by Toad the Wet Sprocket during the mid-90s section of Jobs life. Those were good years.) ""Jobs"" follows the man from his barefoot days at Reed College and his first job at Atari (where his boss declares hes impossible to work with) through the creation of Apple Computers in his parents garage with pal Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Josh Gad from Broadways ""The Book of Mormon"" who provides the rare traces of pathos and humanity here). Investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) steps in with financial support and poof An empire is born. From there its a series of professional ups and downs. Jobs is hailed as a genius but also blamed for perfectionistic production delays and drops in the companys stock price. His feud is with Microsoft guru Bill Gates emerges from nowhere and then just as quickly disappears. His cruelty to underlings is explained away with the cliche of power changing him. Eventually he is the victim of a bloody coup (led by J.K. Simmons as board president and Matthew Modine as chief executive officer) but in time he returns triumphant. While we see the nuts and bolts of the machinery Jobs creates we have a harder time understanding what hes made of as a man. He was adopted yet he coldly casts aside his own daughter when shes still in his girlfriends womb and later denies paternity and visitation rights. Apparently he and daughter Lisa have reconciled by the time hes living a cushy life decades later as a consultant before coming back as Apples CEO. How that happened -- or who his new beautiful and nameless new wife is for example -- are fundamental pieces that would have helped flesh him out as a human being. Theres much bandying about of Jobs mantra that you need to offer people what they want before they even know they want it. The people behind ""Jobs"" theoretically knew that people would want an insightful film about an enormously influential figure but they didnt deliver it. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Apple Ashton Kutcher biopic Steve Jobs 12 Comments on ""Jobs"" August 16 2013  by  JozieLee     Maybe it was just too soon to tell Jobs story. Not enough memoirs or tell-all books have been written about his life for a screenwriter to flesh him out. Reply August 21 2013  by  Jane     I dont know who you think you are and why your opinion even matters. However your review is repulsive and a disgrace on the memory of Steve Jobs. You need to watch the film again and have an open mind. If youre going to write a review at least have a middle ground. No one appreciates your dumb illogical review. Grow up. Reply August 29 2013  by  p     Youre not saying this for real are you? The author of the review of very diplomatic in saying that the film is crap. Which it is. Reply September 20 2013  by  Jason Roberts     Are you serious? Just watched the movie and its not great in my opinion. Its her job to review movies thats what you came here for right? You arent obligated to agree with her but her review has absolutely nothing to do with the ""memory"" of Steve Jobs. Who in all reality was a ass. And to be perfectly clear nothing but good at marketing. He invented nothing stole or appropriated all of Apples products and generally figured out a way to market existing products to half-witted consumers concerned with nothing more than technology as a status symbol. Obviously you bought into some hype that isnt so deserving. Your comment made me cringe. You sound like you just hopped out of the fellate Steve Jobs line to shout meaningless nonsense to anyone can hear you about your new Jesus. Reply September 22 2013  by  Jerry Nissen     Perhaps you moderate your tone....... This review makes some valid points. Reply April 3 2014  by  Joe Bloggs     I thought the review was on-point. Is the reviewer supposed to play nice just because the movie is about someone who is deceased? I actually thought the review was probably a bit more generous than its subject deserved. The best thing about the movie is the hair and makeup. Other than that... Reply April 22 2014  by  nick     Well said Reply August 29 2013  by  JozieLee     I guess we all have a right to our opinion about Steve Jobs and the quality of this movie. Steve Wozniak recently interviewed by Piers Morgan said the movie captures Jobs mannerisms but not the genius of his mind. Wozniak also said he was available for consulting on the film but theyd already written the screenplay and there was no room for his input by the time hed read the script. Wozniak is being accused of wanting to bash this film so that another one being developed by Aaron Sorkin will do better. Wozniak says he has no dog in the fight. In the coming years well probably be seeing lots of movies about Jobs and none of them will capture the real man because he was just too large a character - so many things to so many people. Im just so glad to have lived during his lifetime so I can remember the stories and impressions. And every now and then I go over to YouTube to watch the 2005 commencement speech he delivered at Stanford. Very inspirational. http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc Reply September 12 2013  by  Ben     Say what you will about th script but this movie was perfectly cast. I havent seen it yet but knowing that Steve Jobs liked to party and said ""whoa"" and ""dude"" a lot I can think of no one better than the Kutch to play him. Reply October 27 2013  by  Ruben     Im waiting for the movie... ""Gates"" Reply Pingback Offtopice - 23 august 2013 | BLOGARY April 27 2014  by  Juan     This review is horrid the author cant efficiently uphold credibility. She criticizes for example the musical cues and states them to be meaningless when afterward she goes on to elaborate ""I was however happy to hear Walk on the Ocean... during the mid-90s section of Jobs life. Those were good years.)"" without realizing that due to her closed mind that her reaction to the song is the sole purpose of it being included. No you wont connect with every song I would say but I shouldnt be that one who has to mention this to a critic one fall of credibility kills your review for me after all there are many other critics who wont fail to hold my trust as they accompany evidence alongside. Only reason Im stating this is since everyone backed on defending the critic if not you close minded people would have continued overlooking everything little thing that matters.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Can a single feature film fit together the jigsaw pieces that formed Steve Jobs? How do you reconcile the barefoot hippie drug dabbler with the cutthroat empire-builder who became one of the most successful businessmen of the 20th (and 21st) century? The ruthless control freak whose marketing praised rebels and freethinkers? The child put up for adoption by his biological father who then denied paternity of his own firstborn? If ever a man was a miniseries its Jobs. ""Jobs"" doesnt undertake the titanic task of resolving its enigmatic subjects contradictions. Beginning with Jobs as an elder statesman of Silicon Valley it rewinds to cover his formative years from his garage-startup days producing the first Apple circuit boards through the birth of the iMac. Its a cleaned-up overview (it never mentions that Jobs first business venture with tech wiz Steve Wozniak was ripping off the phone company with illegal accessories for making free long distance calls.) Still there are enough examples of Jobs thermonuclear temper and Machiavellian temperament to keep Joshua Michael Sterns biopic from being mere corporate hagiography. It will certainly tide us over until the arrival of Sonys upcoming big-budget Jobs drama written by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network""). Just as skeptics underestimated Jobs at their peril the haters who predicted that Ashton Kutcher would embarrass himself as Jobs were simply wrong. Though he looks almost emaciated (following Jobs fruit-only diet landed Kutcher in the hospital) he radiates hustling energy and confidence. He carries -- no dominates -- virtually every scene in the film. His Jobs is a hot-eyed acrimonious innovator with no time for backtalk or B players. In 1976 (punch card mainframes rotary phones vinyl recordings) Jobs scarcely out of his teens grasps future possibilities no one else envisions. He foresees personal computers not as a niche product for engineers but as elegantly simple information ""appliances"" everyone should use -- and buy. His adversaries range from balky programmers who dont see why a word processor needs a gallery of typefaces to pinstriped marketing drones convinced that innovation and profit cant coexist to the board of directors (J.K. Simmons Matthew Modine and Dermot Mulroney among them) who dismiss him from his own company and run it to near-bankruptcy. Every chapter of the story has Kutcher colliding with obstacles to his aims. Rarely has an actor brought so much variety to looking pissed off. Josh Gad exudes teddy bear charm as Woz the computer savant who inhabited the opposite extreme of the Myers-Briggs personality scale. In early scenes filmed in the actual garage of Jobs parents bungalow hes a naive pipsqueak steamrolled over and again by his forceful partner. By the mid-80s with Jobs locked in a death struggle against the floundering companys board hes heartbroken to see the arrogant obsessive his colleague has become. ""This doesnt end well for you"" he predicts tears on his cheeks. Hes sincere but like the other Jobs doubters hes wrong. JOBS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for drug content and brief strong language. Not much of the film deals in private moments. Most of the action occurs in conference rooms design studios and engineers bullpens with careful attention to the historical record. Even the design of the original Apple circuit board is spot-on. As Jobs tells his designers ""even the smallest details are important."" Its in the overview the movies obligation to entertain that it comes up short. John Debneys elbow-in-the-ribs score tells us precisely what we ought to be feeling in every scene. Stern (who directed the Kevin Costner political drama ""Swing Vote"") makes the sort of obvious cliched choices that would have sent Jobs into a spittle-flecked meltdown. Other than people who are mildly curious about the guy who put the smartphone in their pocket and the tablet computer in their knapsack Im not sure who ""Jobs"" was made for. Its no embarrassment but given its subject it should have been insanely great. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

It even begins with applause as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher looking a lot like the actual Steve Jobs) addresses the companys town hall in 2001 introducing the iPod. ""What it represents is as important as what it is"" he says. ""Its a tool for the heart"" putting that emphasis on certain key words that marked Jobss tech visionary/marketing guru cadence. Were barely a minute into the movie and the music has already begun to soar triumphantly. Now the people who made JobsA -- director Joshua Michael Stern and writer Matt Whiteley -- arent stupid. They know its too early to start with the exultant crescendos. They know that they dont need to mythologize Steve Jobs because our culture has already done so. Rather the film attempts to start from the myth and work its way back showing the hard work and heartbreak and screaming fits and occasional backstabbing that went into such innovations as the personal computer the really small personal computer and the really pretty personal computer. The problem is that the film gets too wrapped up in the myth to tell an effective behind-the-scenes tale. The flashback narrative starts off with young Reed College student Jobs (Kutcher now looking a bit more like Ashton Kutcher) passed out on a couch in the early seventies waking up and walking shoeless around campus an aimless guy whos not sure hes cut out for the whole higher education racket. Hes also a bit of a careless Lothario at one point meeting and bedding a young coed then taking three drops of acid from her -- ""to share with my friend and my girlfriend."" When he does get high Steve is prone to getting mopey about the fact that hes adopted and that he was once somebodys unwanted child ""Who has a baby and just throws it away like its nothing?"" he weeps. Anyway one montage of traveling around India and learning about personal enlightenment later we find Steve working for Atari still not particularly motivated and lacking in both personal hygiene and social skills. Sent off to work on a struggling video game project for his company he reconnects with his engineer friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad in a very good performance) and becomes obsessed with a personal project of Wozs a motherboard for a personal computing device. The film is at its best when detailing these early years as Jobs and Woz try to put together and sell their harebrained scheme to make these personal computers enlisting a ragtag band of nerds misfits and engineers to help them. At one point director Stern shoots these guys putting together the first Apple computers in slow-motion plugging in circuits and whatnot; funny yet touching its the one scene in the film where this heroic approach to the tale briefly makes sense. After things take off the movie goes into narrative hyperdrive touching on Jobss efforts to develop the Apple Lisa then the Macintosh his struggles with investors his removal as CEO and his eventual fated return. Along the way we get what might seem on paper like a balanced even critical portrait. We see Jobs screw over many in his initial Apple team over stock options. We see Jobs neglect his child in an ironic echo of the pain of his own youth. We see Jobs unable to control his fury at the idea that the suits that he has to deal with fail to appreciate his vision. We see him curse out Bill Gates over the phone. All along the way though are Steve Jobss Don Draper moments -- those moments when he reveals that what people are looking for isnt a product but an attitude a posture a way of being or belonging. That was of course the genius of Steve Jobs Who else could turn the idea of computers with splashes of color into some sort of generational event? Its not necessarily a bad thing for a film to be enamored of its own subject and if youre the kind of guy who gets weepy at remembering the first time you saw a blue iMac then youll probably want to check Jobs out. But this mythic approach can become a problem if it bleeds over into the structure of the film. What made The Social Network click was that its creators didnt seem to care much for (or for that matter even understand) Facebook the company the creation. The appeal of social media was for them important only insofar as it had dramatic relevance -- the product catching on was a plot point not the equivalent of Christianity taking root in the civilized world. Jobs for its part leaves us with emotional crescendos where story should be It gives us stirring scenes of Jobs introducing the first Apple computers the first Macintosh the first iPod then abandons the thread fading out or flashing forward or whatever. It leaves us to complete the tale the cinematic equivalent of the expression ""And the rest is history."" Its the kind of approach that might work in a Jesus movie but not in the tale of a charismatic business leader. For all its attempts at an evenhanded portrayal Jobs cant transcend mere hagiography.

"Jobs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jobs ) Jobs (United States 2013) August 16 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Jobs could have been so much more but the desire to rush it into production and get it out fast (it started filming about six months after the ex-Apple CEOs death) has transformed it into a missed opportunity. A standard-order scattershot bio-pic Jobs offers a few nice moments and a surprisingly effective performance from Ashton Kutcher but one gets no better sense of Steve Jobs here than could be gleaned from reading his Wikipedia article. The movie amounts to a series of vignettes that tell only parts of a fragmented story. Jobs has been decried by many of the characters real-life counterparts as being grossly inaccurate. In the end that doesnt matter anymore here than it did in The Social Network. The difference is that while The Social Network was compelling and relevant Jobs feels like the kind of production that used to be made for network TV (back in the days when network TV was still making movies). Jobs makes the catastrophic mistake of trying to shoehorn more than 25 years (early 70s through 2000) into two hours. That almost never works. Perhaps writer Matt Whiteley and director Joshua Michael Stern would have been well-served by studying bio-pics that actually succeed. From Patton to Lincoln it has been shown that the best way to bring a real-life figure to the screen is to depict a specific limited period of his life. Cherry-picking incidents (both factual and fictional) rarely works since that approach often leads to a sense of events being rushed while the jumping around in time can be disconcerting. Thats the case with Jobs. While we get a vague sense of what makes the character tick - his charisma and drive are constants - were left with only a choppy understanding of the chronology of his life. Where for example did the wife and son come from? And how did his daughter by another woman end up sleeping on his couch? Unanswered questions like these plague the movie making one wonder whether a longer more coherent cut of Jobs exists. The much-maligned Ashton Kutcher deserves credit for taking the time and effort to study his subject. Not only does he look like Steve Jobs but he has perfected the walk and mannerisms. Some might argue that this is more an act of mimicry than a well-honed performance but whatever the case its effective. Kutcher disappears into the character which is a key qualification in any bio-pic. (He isnt required to portray the post-cancer Jobs. The movies chronology ends with a single scene set around the turn of the century. The cancer wasnt discovered until 2003.) Jobs starts sluggishly and the early scenes lack focus as were introduced to a teenage version of the man while at Reed College. With his best friend of the time Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) he drops acid talks pretentiously and visits India. When he returns he forms a partnership with electronics wunderkind Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) and begins to make computers. Apple is born in Steves parents garage and with the capital provided by investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) quickly expands into a major force in the fledgling industry. By 1984 Jobs finds himself in trouble with Apples board of directors and by the end of 1986 hes out. Ten years later Apple comes begging for Jobs return. More politically savvy and understanding of corporate politics he puts aside old grudges and comes back transforming a financially struggling company into the Goliath it is today. Jobs isnt a complete miss. In fact while its portrait of the title characters life is frustratingly incomplete it provides reminders of how the home computer revolution changed everyday American lifestyles. Twenty years was all it took for the concept of a computer in the house to develop from a curiosity to a necessity. Jobs also offers the possibly unintentional thesis that without Steve at the helm Apple may be headed for a fall. Although not an engineer Jobs had a vision and worked tirelessly to innovate. He was never happy with just making a better product; he wanted something different. The implication advanced by Jobs is that without Steve Apple will become just another computer company and that the string of ""next great gadgets"" that characterized its business plan during the second Jobs era (1996-2011) may no longer be able to move forward. Another question that needs to be asked is whether Jobs life is worthy of a cinematic telling. Theres no debating his importance to computing during the late 20th and early 21st centuries but how much of a story is there? The film is at its best when it shows Jobs at work - whether in the garage with Wozniak or in a lab working on the first iteration of the Macintosh. His political battles with the Apple board and his betrayal by CEO Jack Scully (Matthew Modine) are too broadly painted to gain traction. Great men dont always have great lives and part of the problem with Jobs could be that simple fact. Either that or the movie doesnt figure out how to portray the greatness. ""Compelling"" is a word one could apply to Jobs - he was a magnetic figure - but it doesnt describe this movie. ""Average"" might even be a stretch and thats something of an insult to the man whose story it tells.

(Glen Wilson) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 15 2013 525 PM Title Jobs Film Info PG-13 Drug use language. Area theaters. Like the man its about ""Jobs"" is thin and unassuming but keeps surprising you with ideas and innovation. An almost ironically styled old-fashioned biopic this sharp look at the late Steve Jobs and the technological and cultural changes he brought about is entertaining and smart with a great career 2.0 performance from Ashton Kutcher. Kutchers Zen-style bemusement is front and center as the soon-to-be Apple co-founder is seen in 1971 having dropped out of college in Portland -- though he still goes to classes (often barefooted). Jobs does drugs takes a consciousness-raising trip to India and dates a woman (Abby Brammell) he says he loves but may not care about. What Jobs always curious about things people are working on does care about is ideas. When he and pal Steve Wozniak (an endearing Josh Gad) get a quick gig with Atari they fix the assigned problem and then take a right turn into inspiration. After turning their attention to making a personal computer they make one thats a combo of a typewriter and a television. Once their fledgling business gets investors the hippie-ish Jobs with an all-fruit diet and mellow mien that hides a monster competitive streak lets others do the heavy lifting. But hes not as spacey as he seems. After Apple moves out of his parents garage and into the real world he coldheartedly blocks the guys who helped him and Woz from getting shares in the company. From left Josh Gad Ashton Kutcher and Ron Eldard in Jobs (Glen Wilson) As Jobs and Apple introduce the Macintosh his antisocial behavior -- present when he was at Atari -- gets worse. His girlfriend gets pregnant and he denies paternity despite tests that prove otherwise. He puts creativity ahead of profits to such a degree that the Apple board (Matthew Modine Dermot Mulroney and J.K. Simmons play the business-suited adults) reduces Jobs to a figurehead. He resigns and after returning years later following corporate upheaval hes got lots of plans -- including one for a tiny device that can play music which is where the film wraps up in 2001. Obviously we all know where those ideas led. Stern (""Swing Vote"") and screenwriter Matt Whiteley nod to those leaps in this DIY-spirited movie which isnt based on any biography of Jobs who died of cancer in 2011. They subtly link Jobs itchy intelligence and simmering drive to his issues with being adopted. And Kutcher in the role he seems born to play captures the mans intensity and charisma (as well as his loping almost simian gait). Ashton Kutcher portrays the mercurial Apple chief in the companys early years. (Glen Wilson/AP) A top supporting cast backs him up and Stern sets it to a jangly soundtrack and fills it with filmic flourishes. This chronicle of a tech god may seem like a BlackBerry-style flick next to that cinematic iPhone 5 ""The Social Network."" But dont be fooled ""Jobs"" is top of the line. Its late subject may or may not have approved -- but hed almost surely have claimed ownership for himself.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 16 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 16 2013 1143AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Lee Daniels Written by Danny Strong Starring Forest Whitaker Oprah Winfrey Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2013 Country USA Language English Jobs (Two stars); directed by Joshua Michael Stern; written by Matt Whiteley; starring Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad; classification 14ATwo new inspirational movies Lee Daniels The Butler and Jobs are the kind of unsophisticated biographical films that dont earn much critical respect but occasionally rack up Oscar nominations. They belong in what Dennis Bingham author of Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre calls ""a respectable genre of very low repute."" Both movies trip over the usual bio-hazards - gratuitous montages speechifying characters and plots with historical incidents layered between private crises - but they play out in very different ways. Multimedia The Butler The official trailer Multimedia Jobs The official trailer Lee Daniels The Butler (the directors name was imposed after a legal dispute forbid the use of The Butler) stars Forest Whitaker as a long-serving White House butler during a turbulent period. The film has a lot of momentum thanks to a star-studded ensemble cast including Whitaker in the titular role and Oprah Winfrey in her first big-screen role in 15 years. The filmmakers claim that The Butler was inspired by the late Eugene Allen a White House employee who worked for presidents from Truman to Reagan and lived to see the first black president. But Allens story has little to do with The Butlers script a Forrest Gump-like tale of a servant who was a front-row witness to modern civil-rights history. The butlers name has been changed to Cecil Gaines.As a filmmaker Daniels (Precious The Paperboy) likes things pulpy and you quickly get the sense that he cant restrict himself to the Masterpiece Theatre model here. The Butler starts with an entirely fabricated sequence straight out of a Blaxploitation movie in which pre-teen Cecil witnesses his mothers rape and his fathers murder. The killers mom (Vanessa Redgrave) takes the boy into her house where he learns to serve and shut up. Eventually Cecil (played by a slim and convincingly youthful Whitaker) marries Gloria (Winfrey) and has two sons before being hired at the White House. Though hes instructed to see and hear nothing he is invariably hovering over the shoulder of one president or another during critical historical moments.Screenwriter Danny Strong who wrote the sharp television satire of the Sarah Palin campaign Game Change offers the usual biographical double strands of the characters public and private roles. One of Cecil and Glorias improbable friends is Howard (Terrence Howard) a layabout numbers-runner with a missing front tooth and a yen for Gloria. Gloria turns to drink and adultery when Cecil puts the presidents needs before his wifes which provides Oprah with some juicy scenes. The couple also has two opposite-minded sons. Louis (David Oyelowo) under the influence of his groovy college girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia) joins the wave of northern students who pushed for desegregation in the south in 1961. Little brother Charlie (Elijah Kelley) meanwhile signs up for duty in Vietnam.By contrast the White House feels like comic relief with a parade of presidential caricatures pensive Dwight Eisenhower (Robin Williams) who ponders sending federal troops to enforce school integration while painting flowers; awkward vice-president Richard Nixon (John Cusack) found in the kitchen scrounging for snacks; bumptious Lyndon Johnson (Liev Schreiber) who bellows instructions to his cabinet while seated on the toilet; and folksy Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) whose smoothly controlling wife Nancy is played by former lefty activist Jane Fonda.Some of this is fun if heavy-handed but from time to time Daniels broad approach hits home emotionally particularly a scene that contrasts preparations for a White House state dinner with black students being spat upon and cursed for sitting on the white side of a segregated Woolworths counter. The Butler may be a sanctimonious cartoon but it points to events in the civil rights struggle that were as grotesque and extraordinary as any fiction can invent.Speaking of invention its difficult to know what motivated this pedestrian biopic of the late inventor Steve Jobs beyond a posthumous declaration that he was right after all. The movie follows a 20-year period from Jobss college days to his presentation of the iPod in 2001 and stars Ashton Kutcher who does a good impersonation of the Apple co-founders hunched over posture and reedy voice. But did Jobs actually strut around like the hero of an Ayn Rand novel alternately making inspirational speeches about the future and denouncing the fools who tried to compromise his vision? If so why did anyone like him?We begin with the familiar story of the aspiring genius dropping out of college heading to India then dropping acid in a scene in which Jobs spins in a wheat field and presumably gazes into our collective wired future.A couple of years later Jobs convinces his sweet-natured chubby friend Steve Wozniak that they should build and sell personal computers. Woz though kind of a genius himself cant believe anyone would want to own a computer. (The real Wozniak who is consulting on another movie about Jobs written by Aaron Sorkin says the scene is nonsense Everybody wanted a computer.).Investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) brings in much-needed cash to convert a garage into a lab and manufacturing plant.Triumphs and setbacks and more triumphs follow. Director Joshua Michael Stern and writer Matt Whiteley show Jobss cruel side - dumping a pregnant girlfriend (Ahna OReilly) and cutting founding partners out of the companys astronomical profit - proving the movie is not hagiography.Actually its something much duller a career summary. The films last half follows Jobss loss of Apple and then his comeback in the nineties when he turned the company around depicted as a series of boardroom power plays before Jobs emerges as the hero of a new generation of Apple underlings who pledge allegiance to his credo of radical excellence.In a recent interview on The Colbert Report Kutcher said he felt the movie was about how Steve Jobs lacked love in his life but found it from customers appreciation of his beautiful products. I wish the movie had communicated any of that. If Jobs had been a producer on Jobs he would have sent it back to the lab for a redesign.

The similar if slightly more complicated idea of ""Jobs"" is that Steve Jobs who led a revolution to connect humans to technology was himself unable to really connect to anyone. Its a neat approach -- maybe too neat. (For example although ""The Social Network"" pushed the idea of Zuckerberg as a solitary misfit in reality he had a longtime girlfriend -- whom hes since married.) But in Jobs case it may be true. He was a charismatic leader and the greatest salesman the industry ever saw. He was also a very vocal spokesman for the graying counterculture -- crediting his high-tech success to Zen Buddhism Dylan songs and acid trips. But a nice man? A few ex-friends and former partners might dispute that. So might the mother of his first child (who -- and the film doesnt mention this -- ended up on welfare for two years when the mogul refused to pay child support). To its credit ""Jobs"" the movie still catches -- with some elisions -- a lot of that. You see the man slowly shedding friends cutting colleagues out of lucrative stock options firing people during screaming matches. Yet you also see the group around him growing -- as new people (often equally socially stunted but hungry for purpose) respond to his missionary zeal and join his cultish entourage. (Just be thankful he invented a computer not a religion.) JOBS    Open Road (122 min.) Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. With Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad. Now playing in New Jersey. Find a theater Written by first-timer Matt Whiteley the film focuses on Jobs life from his college days to his triumphant post-corporate-coup return as the head of Apple; although Bill Gates remains merely an offscreen nemesis true computer geeks will appreciate Josh Gads portrait of Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak perhaps the real genius behind it all. Jobs never had his friends technical savvy and he knew it. What he was very good at though -- besides negotiating inspiring or just plain bullying -- was marketing and design. He made new products seem suddenly necessary -- and insisted they look nice and were fun to hold. (If you have an iPad or iPhone - and its a large part of Jobs genius that you probably do -- pull it out now and just look at it. Do you see a single awkward edge or extraneous button?) As Jobs Ashton Kutchers performance is nearly as well-engineered. Trot out all the outdated ""Dude Wheres My Car"" jokes you want but hes a smart geek himself and unlike most hes clearly read the manual more than just Jobs intense gaze he gets his oddly hunched lurching walk and the priestly way he used his hands. What the movie doesnt do unfortunately is dig beyond the cleanly engineered surfaces. Yes theres a quick mention that Jobs was adopted -- but were left to guess how this affected his obvious inability or disinterest in forming attachments. To the point of at one point abandoning his own child -- just as he was abandoned. Nor does the film illustrate how he changed -- if in fact he ever did. We see friends walking out of his life (and sometimes Jobs pushing them). But did he ever bring any of them back? Did he ever see the need to? Or were they like the detachable keyboard just one more utilitarian component hed found a way of separating? In the films opening sequence set at a company meeting an older Jobs displays the brand-new iPod a tiny device which he announces proudly can ""put 1000 songs in your pocket."" It is no less he says than ""a tool for the heart."" But the key to Jobs? That remains buried deep in code. Ratings note The film contains drug use sexual situations and strong language.

The Posts Hayley Tsukayama takes a look at some of the major characters in the movie and their real-life counterparts. Actor Ashton Kutcher Actor Ashton Kutcher who is the lead actor in the movie bears a striking physical resemblance to Steve Jobs the Apple co-founder and the flicks namesake. With ""Jobs"" Kutcher said he hopes his performance is as much a lesson about entrepreneurship to todays youths as it is a profile of a man who revolutionized technology. While Kutcher managed to embody Jobs physically it was still hard not to picture Kutcher as his ""That 70s Show"" character Kelso. Glen Wilson/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Michael OSullivan August 15 2013 At the risk of damning with faint praise it should be noted that Ashton Kutcher is not a disaster in ""Jobs."" A dramatization of the life of Apple founder and chief executive Steve Jobs the movie opens with a brief prologue showing Kutcher in a graying beard at the 2001 unveiling of the iPod music player. The film then leaps backward to the 1970s when a barefoot and much younger Jobs is about to become a Reed College dropout. The shaggy-haired hippie kid is far more comfortable territory for Kutcher who in his mid-30s still looks and sounds like a boy. Flashing back to the character as a young man helps the audience get used to Kutcher in the role. The initial shock of seeing the baby-faced actor playing a 46-year-old man subsides allowing his portrayal to grow on you -- and Kutcher to grow into the part -- as the character matures. The film follows Jobs from the creation of Apple Computer in his parents garage to his 1985 firing and triumphant return to the company in 1996. Kutcher does a couple of things well aping Jobss guarded tight-lipped smile and familiar half-hunching half-bouncing gait even if at times they seem more like ill-fitting mannerisms than expressions of Jobss driven personality. But theres a void inside the man that Kutcher never manages to fill. The problem is not with the actor but with the film itself. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern (""Swing Vote"") and written by first-time screenwriter Matt Whiteley ""Jobs"" confuses the story of Apple the company with the story of its guru and guiding force spending way too much time on backroom personnel dealings than on encounters that might help us understand on a deep level the title character. Admittedly the story of Jobss entrepreneurship is a fascinating one in its own right and the film makes it clear that he was as much a corporate shark as a creative visionary. Yet even as the movie tracks the ups and down of Jobss career it gets bogged down in the fate of other less central -- and frankly less interesting -- players. Is the films abridged parade of Apple CEOs -- Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) John Sculley (Matthew Modine) and Gil Amelio (Kevin Dunn) -- really of interest to anyone besides Apple geeks? Focusing on those details ""Jobs"" gives short shrift to the storys human side. Theres an initial suggestion that Jobss relationship with his daughter with an ex-girlfriend will be an important theme. But its ultimately handled in only the most cursory way. We see their relationship begin as estrangement revealing a nasty side of the films subject and showing that the filmmakers arent afraid of honesty. Much later however when its clear that there has been a reconciliation the connective tissue is missing. It would be nice to see how Jobs and his daughter repaired their relationship. Instead the vast majority of the movie concerns his professional life giving an unfortunate new meaning to the films title. One exception is Jobss friendship and partnership with Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Josh Gad). As Apples sweetly geeky co-founder Gad is a real pleasure and his scenes with Kutcher help us understand Jobs even when -- maybe especially when -- the two are awkwardly parting ways late in the film. If the movie has a point its that Jobs may have been a genius but that he was no saint. When hes firing a low-level Apple staffer because the employee doesnt care enough about computer type fonts its both funny and painful (and yes a bit gratifying). Although I think I could watch a whole movie called ""Woz"" and not grow tired ""Jobs"" eventually begins to suffer from an ailment common to many biopics milestone fatigue. The film is so thick with Jobss career highlights and lowlights that theres little room for insights. What made this famously private man tick? Kutcher tries to tell us but ""Jobs"" keeps getting in the way. Its probably a good thing that the story stops in the mid-1990s instead of following the narrative all the way to Jobss death from pancreatic cancer in 2011. If it were any more thorough it could be a CNBC miniseries. Im just not sure that it would be more illuminating. 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Consumed by their own dazzling brilliance they treat those closest to them cruelly and thoughtlessly causing much undue suffering--only to turn around and invent a device that can put 1000 songs in your pocket. Damn them.If what we see in director Joshua Michael Sterns Jobs is true Apple cofounder and all-around cool-product guru Steve Jobs who died in 2011 was no bargain in the human-being department. When an early girlfriend--played by Ahna OReilly--tells him shes pregnant with what shes certain is his child he informs her icily that her condition isnt his problem. But in addition to putting those 1000 songs in our pocket this asshole with a capital A is also hugely responsible for the efficient and beautifully designed machine on which I type these words--and quite likely the machine on which you read them. Jobs tries feebly to balance the mans epic contributions to the universe with his all-out douchebaggery. But how much of the latter can we let alone Jobss poor girlfriend be expected to take?Jobs covers the years 1971 to 1991 though it opens with an epigraph set in 2001. Our first glimpse of this Jobs played by Ashton Kutcher is as a benevolent-looking graying middle-aged gent addressing his loyal impossibly young employees. Hes about to unveil a new product--the iPod as it turns out--but his audience is already high on his Kool-Aid. As he strides across the stage a charismatic nerd in mom jeans their eyes follow him rapturously; theyre like Silicon Valley Children of the Corn.Film Details Jobs RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time122 More Info He Who Walks Ahead of the Curve speaks in earnest-sounding but totally marketing-ready slogans The new device he informs them is a ""tool for the heart. And when you can touch someones heart--thats limitless."" The movie wants us to see the man spouting these bromides as an older wiser one a man who started a company and then lost control of it only to retake the reins and turn it into a global brand whose products touch the part of peoples hearts thats directly connected to their wallets. But the Steve Jobs we see through most of Jobs is the younger more ruthless one. We first meet him in 1971 a Reed College dropout He sticks around campus because he doesnt know what else to do padding from one class to another in bare feet--hes so nonconformist he cant stand to wear shoes. (Later perhaps having realized theyre a necessary evil he accepts Birkenstocks before moving on to puffy old-man sneakers.)Kutcher is wonderful in these scenes. Actually Kutcher is pretty wonderful throughout Jobs He plays the very young Jobs as a calculating hippie kid whose perpetual sense of wonderment--so irresistible to all the chicks--walks hand-in-hand with steely shrewdness. (When the sweet pretty co-ed with whom hes just fallen into bed offers him a tab of acid he obliges and asks if he can take a few more one for his friend and one for his girlfriend.) After his nongraduation Jobs somehow lands work at video-game pioneer Atari. There he realizes he just cant work for the man--who (shudder) makes him wear shoes--and with the help of a few friends founds an early version of Apple in his parents garage. At this point he sports facial hair that makes him look like an apostle from a childrens illustrated Bible Hes interested in spreading the good word not actually writing it.That of course changes pretty quickly. The scenes in which Jobs and his pals build a company by the seat of their pants are the most exhilarating Their perpetual cluelessness with its attendant restless energy keeps the early part of the movie percolating. Lukas Haas plays Jobss sweet-natured but unambitious college friend Daniel who becomes just one victim of the Great Mans ruthlessness. Josh Gad plays Jobss loyal pal and chief computer builder Steve Wozniak as a salt-of-the-earth geek Hes the real soul of the new machine and its easy to believe thered be no Apple without him.But Jobs gets bogged down once the suits get involved as they inevitably must. The great J.K. Simmons is wasted as a corporate bad guy in an even worse toupee. Dermot Mulroney as Apple angel investor Mike Markkula has more to do and at the very least gets a great entrance He drives up to Apples parental-garage headquarters in a lemony-gold 70s Stingray a symbol of success that turns the tech nerds eyes into awestruck little pinwheels.But Stern who directed the 2008 Swing Vote with Kevin Costner cant keep the movie purring smoothly and too often he picks up potentially interesting threads only to drop them James Woods shows up early on as a professor who sees Jobss spark of whatever-it-is but hes really little more than the symbolic Teacher Who Cared. Also a bubbly blonde wife (Abby Brammell) so cheerful in her suburban errand-running hoodie appears unexplained late in the movie. How did that happen? Suddenly the Steve Jobs who so conveniently ignored the existence of his firstborn daughter (while also--go figure--naming a failed computer after her) has had some sort of epiphany about building meaningful human relationships. Stern elides all of that. The movie itself ultimately worshipful ends up being Jobs-like in the cold way it treats flesh-and-blood people.But if Stern lets Jobs off the hook Kutcher doesnt. Occasionally to suggest inner turmoil hell tremble and clench his fists--thats the hammy stuff. But mostly Kutcher only hints at what might be going on behind this confounding mans ever-shifting eyes. Kutcher finds compassion without going for anything so cheap as an explanation for Jobss bad behavior; its a wily understated performance.Jobs put a lot of himself into the products he developed. To love your MacBook your iPod your iPhone is to love Steve Jobs the man just a little bit from a convenient distance. Kutcher had it harder He had to get right inside Jobss head and his performance suggests that it wasnt a fun place to be.

Starring Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. (PG-13. 122 minutes.) For most of its running time ""Jobs"" is a satisfying account of the career of Steve Jobs who rose to become one of the great entrepreneurs and technological innovators of our era. In the last half hour the movie slows down and starts to disappoint and yet not so much that people with a particular interest in Jobs or the history of computers should avoid seeing it. At its best its a good picture and at its worst its almost good. Surprisingly it doesnt fail in the ways some might expect. Ashton Kutcher is perfectly convincing as Jobs from his first minutes onscreen. He looks like him walks like him and he gets into his skin. He looks at people the way Jobs looked at people arrogantly quizzically skeptically often amused but not especially friendly. And yet somehow Kutcher renders Jobs sympathetic by making us believe that were seeing some peculiar strain of a great man. The movie avoids the obvious trap of whitewashing Jobs personality and character. Far from it. By the time his first boss tells him ""Youre good youre damn good but youre an -hole"" audiences all over the world will be nodding their head. This is a guy who picks up a girl and chooses the moment hes sitting up in bed putting his pants back on to announce that he has a girlfriend. Later when his girlfriend becomes pregnant he has these consoling words for her ""Im sorry you have a problem but its not happening to me. Get out of my house."" He bullies people flies into rages. When he was starting out with computer genius Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) Jobs even cheats his sweet-natured friend out of more than 2000. ""Jobs"" presents us with a man best seen from a distance a coldhearted person who takes pride in his coldness who sees it as a form of strength. This characterization benefits the movie making Jobs into someone we keep wanting to circle back to and examine and try to understand. The film begins with a brief intro set in 2001 in which Jobs introduces the iPod at a company meeting. Then we go back into the past and see Jobs at Reed College in Oregon still auditing classes after having dropped out discovering Eastern philosophy and calligraphy and taking hallucinogenic drugs. Eventually he teams up with Wozniak and in his parents basement they devise the first home computer. This is a familiar story but like the story of Edison and the lightbulb and Bell and the telephone it never really gets old. Jobs although not at all lovable is certainly admirable. Before he is anybody he has remarkable self-command and poise and he understands something about the marketplace that few ever grasp Its not just a matter of giving people what they want. Its about giving people what they dont know they want. Its about anticipating need and desire and its also about elegance. Its about marrying beauty and function. A little bit more on what Jobs and Wozniaks early machines actually did would have been welcome. Instead the movie gets more and more bogged down in business details which are interesting for a time but not wholly absorbing. Another problem is that when Jobs is in conflict with his board of directors its not entirely certain whose side is right. We see Jobs spending lavishly and bullying his underlings but we also see him insisting on quality. But the main flaw of ""Jobs"" is that it limits itself to the ancient history of Jobs rise and fall and rise at Apple. The movie might begin in 2001 but it never returns to the 21st century. Thus all the dramatic events of Jobs last dozen or so years arent dealt with at all. There was the cancer that was supposed to be immediately fatal that instead turned out to have a better prognosis. There was the iPhone which changed the way people live their lives then the iPad. What could be more dramatic than a man living with a death sentence who keeps coming up with amazing world-changing devices just in a brief span of years? Thats when Jobs went from a computer pioneer/entrepreneur to becoming one of the architects and designers of modern life. Its the 21st century Jobs who was the great man not the earlier incarnation. ""Jobs"" should have ended with Jobs death because thats really where the story ended. Instead when the end comes it feels arbitrary. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

And it seems the brilliant and mercurial entrepreneur (played by Ashton Kutcher) was occasionally given to turning on the waterworks himself.  We see him crying in several scenes after hes horrible to his pregnant girlfriend; when his friend Apple co-founder and original tech whiz-kid Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) quits Apple; and again in 1985 after hes pushed out of his own company.  In each case hed been a total creep to the people in his personal and professional life. Which is sad. But none of those scenes pushed me to tears. No my emotions got better of me when faced with my strangely nostaglic attachment to the Apple products of my past. Like the first Mac unveiled in 1984 which looks just like the one I actually lugged on my shoulder across the country. Naturally a tear came to my eye--of course my posture has never been the same.  I got misty-eyed again when Jobs returns to Apple in 1997. Hes shown meeting with industrial designer Jonathan Ive (Giles Matthey) who has produced an early sketch of that cute candy-colored iMac that will soon lead to my first laptop the similarly-hued Book  It was like seeing a picture of myself in a baby doll dress and leggings. The real Jobs probably would have approved of my teary response to his product rather than the person portrayed in this over-stuffed biopic which engages in its early scenes--the young entrepreneurs at work in a Silicon Valley garage are pretty irresistible particularly Gads and Ron Eldard as engineer Rod Holt--but becomes interminable in its second half. (Read An Apple nerds take on the history lessons of Jobs) Sterns and first-time screenwriter Matt Whiteley abbreviate Jobs life story skipping his time at Pixar his battle with  cancer and any post-iPod Apple history. The movie opens with a prologue set in 2001 with Jobs introducing the iPod-- Kutcher looking appropriately slender and aged--before flashing back to 1974 with ""Peace Train"" on the soundtrack and a barefoot Jobs dropping acid at Reed College. The story wraps up around 1997 with Jobs triumphant return to the Cupertino campus of the empire he built. Every new chapter seems to start with a peppy musical interlude (""Keep on rollin"") a bland establishing shot of Silicon Valley and Kutcher walking through the office with that peculiar stooped gait of Jobs. (PHOTOS Take Two Biopic Stars and Their Real-Life Counterparts) The real problem with Jobs is how much time we spend in boardrooms with Jobs and suits like venture capitalist  Arthur Rock (J. K. Simmons) who care only about money and want to thwart his brilliant dreams. Not that the real mans career wasnt marked by conflict but does Jobs have to be such a drag? As reliable a character-actor as they come Simmons cant make this stick in the mud any fun to watch; you may long for Jobs to be pushed out sooner rather than later if only so we wouldnt have to endure another lecture about fiscal responsibility from Rock or early Apple investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney). Or even worse a lecture from Jobs himself. He gives so many inspirational speeches about innovation in Jobs that I was tempted to pull out my laptop and check my email.  In between hes either haranguing some oaf about lack of productivity or firing someone. Do we get a sense of the mans greatness? A bit but mostly we get a sense of the mans douchebaggery. But Kutcher whose acting chops havent been tested in all those pretty-boy lead roles was a welcome surprise. His movie-star glow distracts but there is a strong physical resemblance. Moreover hes got many of Jobs mannerisms down cold from that T Rex-like walk to the fingers that fan the air and the yoga-style postures left over from his bohemian youth. Its a good impression but Jobs itself is all too impressionistic.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 606 p.m. EDT August 15 2013The performances are decent but the film is in the end only a superficial biopic.Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in the biopic Jobs.(Photo Glen Wilson Sundance Institute via AP)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   out of fourStars Ashton Kutcher Dermot Mulroney Josh Gad Matthew Modine J.K. SimmonsRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 2 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideA famous ad for Apple Inc. salutes the misfits rebels and troublemakers those who resist rules and have no respect for the status quo. They can be glorified or vilified the ad continues but never ignored. The reason? ""Because they change things.""Steve Jobs fit squarely into that turf.But Jobs (  out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) the biopic starring Ashton Kutcher as the late co-founder of Apple cant seem to decide whether to glorify the man for his achievements or vilify him for his megalomania. One thing it doesnt do is offer a revealing look at the mercurial entrepreneur. The movie that bears his name settles on a blandly superficial treatment of a deeply complex man.And for that its easy to ignore.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIts a challenge to convey just what makes a cultural icon. But pumped-up orchestral strains and repeated scenes of standing ovations and thunderous applause dont shed any light on Jobs psyche. Those scenes feel like filler anxious proof that their subject is worthy of his own movie. Of course he is -- his innovative products have had an immeasurable impact. But a film about such a game-changing figure needs to be more incisive.Kutcher nails Jobs hunched lurching gait his distinctive speech patterns and his steely gaze (featured in far too many long close-ups). And the actor pulls off a fair approximation of some of the mans personal charm wily determination and explosive temper. But Jobs sought to change the world. What propelled him? Walter Isaacsons exhaustive 2011 biography published shortly after Jobs died at 56 explored his psychology in detail but this movie with an unrelated script by Matt Whiteley falls short. (Aaron Sorkin is adapting another Jobs movie partly based on Isaacsons biography.)Montages of Jobs and his inner circle hard at work on the earliest incarnations of home computers dont offer a window into the man. Nor does the sight of him zooming off in expensive cars often after he has done something selfish. Its the cinematic equivalent of presenting the symptoms but not probing the cause.VIDEO Kutcher and Gad talk about Steve Jobs legacyPREMIERE Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad bring Jobs to New YorkA prologue shows Jobs introducing the iPod in 2001 to great fanfare then flashes back to him as a child. It seeks to establish his early artistic inclinations by exploring his youthful fascination with calligraphy. But this feels like insignificant contrived shorthand.Jobs disregard for the women in his life -- and years-long repudiation of oldest daughter Lisa -- are presented but essentially glossed-over. Other noteworthy aspects of his life such as his involvement in Pixar are omitted.Supporting characters are not fleshed out. As Apple co-founder and tech whiz Steve Wozniak Josh Gad brings gentle humor and sincerity to a role that could have used more development. Other key players are on hand to suffer mostly in silence through Jobs tirades.Overall Jobs the movie is a lazy effort that the real-life Jobs with his laser-focused drive for excellence and uncompromising nature would no doubt have sent back for reworking. 115 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 30 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/13lZWPLSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Glen Wilson/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Glen Wilson/Open Road Films Ashton Kutcher and Josh Gad stand in for Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Joshua Michael Sterns biographical drama Jobs which covers the tech visionarys early career but stops short of his latter-day triumphs. Glen Wilson/Open Road Films Jobs Director Joshua Michael Stern Genre Biography Drama Running Time 127 minutes Rated PG-13 for drug use brief profanity With Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney Lukas Haas Matthew Modine J.K. Simmons Lesley Ann Warren In their approaches to history Joshua Michael Sterns Jobs and Lee Daniels The Butler could hardly be less similar. The former is an example of Victorian-style great-man biography updated for the iThings era. The latter observes monumental events mostly involving the civil rights movement from an Everymans perspective. Yet the two movies have much in common. Neither seriously exerts itself to examine psychology or illustrate character. Nor does either offer significant challenges to conventional wisdom. Instead they proceed as historical pageants re-creating rather than reinterpreting the events they depict. Although some of Steve Jobs former associates have already complained about Sterns biopic the movie generally conforms to the known facts of the Apple co-founders career. The filmmakers even shot in Jobs childhood home whose garage became one of the worlds most celebrated. In fact this merely serviceable film tells the story in such detail that it doesnt have room for Jobs late-career triumphs. Save for a prologue set in 2001 the movie follows its flawed hero only from 1976 when hes a Reed College dropout who still hangs around the campus to 1996 when he returns to a foundering Apple after an 11-year exile. Along the way Jobs alienates most of the people who helped him notably Steve Wozniak (a fine Josh Gad) who did a lot more than his ambitious buddy to develop the Apples I and II. He also clashes with original financial backer Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) and the man he himself recruited to save Apple in the 1980s John Scully (Matthew Modine). Jobs failings -- his arrogance his greed his initial refusal to acknowledge paternity of his oldest child -- are well-documented. So the principal point of controversy involved here is not Jobs himself but Ashton Kutcher who plays him. The actors approach is to ape Jobs speech and movements which he does quite well. Whether mimicry qualifies as characterization is a question for Jobs viewers to answer for themselves. i Forest Whitaker turns in a reserved performance as Cecil Gaines butler to eight U.S. presidents including Robin Williams Dwight D.

Forest Whitaker turns in a reserved performance as Cecil Gaines butler to eight U.S. presidents including Robin Williams Dwight D. Eisenhower in a Lee Daniels drama based on the true story of a White House veteran. Anne Marie Fox/The Weinstein Co. Lee Daniels The Butler Director Lee Daniels Genre Biography Drama Running Time 126 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence profanity sexual situations alcohol abuse smoking With Forest Whitaker Vanessa Redgrave Oprah Winfrey Cuba Gooding Jr. Jane Fonda Lenny Kravitz Robin Williams John Cusack James Marsden Liev Schreiber Mariah Carey It will also prove a perplexity and on a larger scale for anyone who sees The Butler which is packed with stunt casting and distracting performances. Jane Fonda plays Nancy Reagan; a weirdly long-haired John Cusack does a Richard Nixon impression. The mood-breaking incongruities begin as soon as the 8-year-old Cecil Gaines watches his father shot dead in a Georgia cotton field The boy is rescued by an elderly Southern belle played by no less venerable a figure than Vanessa Redgrave. Also onboard and surprisingly believable is Oprah Winfrey as the older Gaines wife Based on a Washington Post story about a longtime White House butler Lee Daniels movie has been extensively fictionalized. The real-life equivalent of Cecil Gaines is Eugene Allen who grew up in Virginia not Georgia. He served eight presidents and their families and was apparently beloved of many of them. (He did not as The Butler would have it raise a son who provided facile dramatic counterpoint by joining the Black Panthers.) The movie is a two-hour tonal skirmish between the big stuff Gaines (Forest Whitaker) observes at work and the small stuff that happens at home. The latter feels reasonably authentic with the likes of Terrence Howard Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Oyelowo as well as Winfrey playing the discreet butlers boisterous friends relatives and neighbors. This side of the story would have worked better though if the filmmakers had paid attention to D.C. details. The occasional exteriors shot in Louisiana are laughable and Gaines assures President Eisenhower (Robin Williams) in 1957 that his sons attend an ""all-colored school"" -- even though Washingtons public schools integrated in 1954. Many of the White House scenes are jarringly motley as Whitaker maintains Gaines dignity against a series of performances that range from bland (James Marsdens JFK) to cartoonish (Liev Schreibers LBJ). It comes as a relief when Daniels reduces Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford to TV clips -- though that strategy makes the film even more of a stylistic jumble. The Butler is carried forward by the sweep of history though and Jobs will benefit from Apple fans devotion to the companys products. If these movies elicit cheers or even draw Oscar nominations the tributes will have been to the subjects more than to the treatments. These sagas are just too good to spoil -- which doesnt mean they didnt deserve better.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Ashton Kutcher looks the part in Jobs. Wearing wire-rims and a beard and carrying himself with a stooped marionette-like gait the actor tries on the guise of Steve Jobs the 1970s college dropout turned new-millennium computer company billionaire. More about Jobs >> Its an American success story of epic proportions but Joshua Michael Sterns biopic of the Apple co-founder is hardly epic. This is not The Social Network (although Jobs like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg burned bridges and turned his back on some of his closest colleagues). Jobs is a just-the-facts - and fiddling-with-the-facts - dramatization forgoing any kind of deeper psychological exploration of the man and his motivations his demons and dreams. The Jobs of Jobs comes off as restless and selfish dropping acid exploring Eastern spiritualism uneasy in the workplace environment more comfortable in his parents garage where he and his tech genius pal Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) first soldered circuit boards and dreamed up the idea of combining ""your typewriter with your television set."" ""Imagine"" Jobs says flexing his marketing muscles even back then. Rolling through the last three decades of the 20th century Jobs follows the ups and downs of the electronics entrepreneurs career spending too much of its time detailing the boardroom power plays and comings and goings of Apple CEOs (John Sculley Gil Amelio). If the bonds and betrayals are Shakespearean they fail to come off as such. There is another Jobs film in the works based on Walter Isaacsons biography and with The Social Networks Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin doing the adaptation. Itll be years before that gets made - if and when it does. But the comparison could be instructive. In the meantime we have Kutcher as Jobs eyes darting hands flying lumbering around the Apple campus impelling his designers and engineers to do more to think outside the box to invent new boxes. He and they did that of course. Apples products have changed the way we live and communicate. I guess thats reason enough to make a movie about the guy. Jobs 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. With Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Matthew Modine J.K. Simmons and Dermot Mulroney. Distributed by Open Road Films.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The life story of Apple co-founder and technological innovator Steve Jobs. Rated PG-13 (language brief drug use) BOTTOM LINE Some fine moments from Kutcher as the visionary Jobs but this sub-par biopic is basically a hasty hash of the obituaries youve already read. CAST Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney LENGTH 207 From the very first scene of ""Jobs"" starring Ashton Kutcher as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs you know exactly where this movie is going. Standing before his famous bitten-fruit logo Jobs delivers a 2001 keynote speech about a new gadget that plays music. ""Introducing the iPod"" he says. The crowd goes wild. The applause cheers and high-pitched screams suggest that this landmark moment is supposed to be a spine-tingler. Instead its a heart-sinker. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Jobs"" turns out to be the IBM PCjr of biographical dramas hampered by creaky formatting and thinking entirely inside the box. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern (""Swing Vote"") and written by first-timer Matt Whitely its a hasty playlist of Jobs greatest hits. (Another Jobs film is reportedly in production with Aaron Sorkin as screenwriter.) This is a familiar story told in the most familiar way The budding visionary and the start-up crew then the sudden riches and damaged friendships. Cue the tearful speech from Josh Gad as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak ""Somethings happening to you Steve."" Kutcher does a fine approximation of Jobs -- the sky-blue jeans the lanky gait -- but the character is shallow speaking in buzzwords like ""limitless"" and ""dream."" The film never views Jobs from a fresh angle nor places him in larger context. It skims his barefoot druggie college days but doesnt seem aware that Jobs was deeply influenced by the 1960s. Apple was one of many California-based hippie-era businesses (like the Whole Earth Catalog a major inspiration for Jobs) that merged counterculture ideals with capitalism. Wouldnt it have been interesting to see how Jobs squared these notions? And to see the graying pioneer compete with a new generation of post-hippie innovators like say Google? But ""Jobs"" couldnt care less. It doesnt even care about the cancer -- never mentioned -- that killed him in 2011. Instead of showing his struggle to run a company while battling the disease ""Jobs"" ends with a series of long boring boardroom coups (Dermot Mulroney and Matthew Modine play the suits). ""Jobs"" mainly wants to state the obvious This guy made awesome stuff Thats certainly true but the movie is everything Jobs tried not to be unimaginative uninspired and typical. 137 MoviesJobs trailer PLOT The life story of Apple co-founder and technological innovator Steve Jobs advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (language brief drug use) CAST Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney LENGTH 207 BOTTOM LINE Some fine moments from Kutcher as the visionary Jobs but this sub-par biopic is basically a hasty hash of the obituaries youve already read.

Photo Everett Collection There may well be a dramatically satisfying movie in the tumultuous life of Steve Jobs -- the technological innovator who founded Apple was forced out returned to revive the dying company into a global giant and was revered as a visionary genius when he died at age 56 in 2011. Joshua Michael Sterns earnest overly worshipful biopic ""Jobs isnt it -- even if it employs Ashton Kutcher an actor with an uncanny resemblance to Jobs who has gone to great pains to even move like his subject. But his performance like the movie is all surface. Theres little illuminating what made the man tick. Or exactly why a barefoot college dropout given to dropping LSD-turned-disgruntled Atari employee quickly becomes a demanding perfectionist who practically wills Apples first personal computer into existence. Instead of showing theres reams of expository dialogue and Jobs spouting marketing slogans beginning with an opening prologue set in 2001 when he introduces the iPod to his awed staff as ""a tool for the heart. The depiction of Apples early years comes dangerously close to an infomercial with the barest glimpses of Jobs adoptive parents (his anguish over abandonment by his birth parents barely alluded to) and the girlfriend he dumps when she announces shes pregnant (he initially denies paternity of the daughter who he later acknowledges). The makers of the Mark Zuckerberg biopic ""The Social Network did a terrific job of exploring the interplay between their subjects drive and his personal demons. But the filmmakers here prefer to focus on the not-always-compelling story of how a disgruntled board member (J.K. Simmons) and Jobs own handpicked CEO (Matthew Modine) together forced his ouster from Apple in 1985 after lengthy arguments over budgets and business strategy centering on the Macintosh. RELATED MALE SCREEN STARS RESORT TO CRAZY DIETS TO SHED POUNDS FOR PLUM ROLES Jobs agrees to return as a consultant to the near-bankrupt company in 1996 and is quickly asked to become CEO which is where the story ends -- seven years before hes diagnosed with cancer. Unlike Kutcher Dermot Mulroney is solid as a major early investor in Apple whose role on the companys board increasingly puts him into conflict with Jobs. But the real acting honors here belong to Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak -- the geeky genius inventor of the Apple 1 -- who leaves the company because of his friends sometimes callous treatment of his most loyal workers. ""Jobs amounts to at best a Cliffs Notes version of the mans early life. If you want the real story youll have to read Walter Isaacsons fascinating 2011 biography which would make a much better film than this one.

"Jobs (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jobs (PG-13) This biopic focusing on the early years of Apple founder Steve Jobs gets his career right but misses the man. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/15/2013 Editor rating 2 Jobs opens in 2001 when an already-gaunt Steve Jobs unveiled a hand-sized gadget called the iPod and promised it would revolutionize the music industry. The casting of Ashton Kutcher in the role of the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. was initially greeted by jeers of derision. But right from that opening scene the actor proves he was up for the challenge channeling Jobs familiar public persona and speech patterns to engaging effect. Too bad the rest of the movie lets him down. Written by first-time Matt Whiteley and directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote) Jobs works much better as a history of Apple than it does as a portrait of the genius who dreamed it up. After that opening scene the movie flashes back to 1974 when Jobs was dropping out of college dropping acid with his girlfriend doodling in calligraphy and taking life-enlightening trips to India with his friend Daniel (Lukas Haas). In these early scenes Jobs comes across as a man of obvious intelligence with a healthy disdain for conventional thinking who is still searching for a place to channel his energies. Hes ambitious and visionary He just doesnt have any idea what to do with himself. Jobs tries working at Atari designing video games for awhile but he has difficulty getting along with his co-workers so he recruits his brainy pal Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Josh Gad) to create a game on their own (the result was the classic Breakout). But when he sees what Woz has been tinkering with in his spare time -- a keyboard and monitor combination that allows you to see what youre working on while youre working on it -- Jobs finds his calling. ""This is the industrial revolution Its profound"" he exclaims unaware of just how true his prediction will become. Jobs is surprisingly thorough at depicting the rise and fall of Apple (Jobs picked the name because it stood for the fruit of creation and it came before Atari in the phone book). Anyone who remembers Commodore computers and Compuserve will derive a retro kick from watching Jobs and his ragtag group of designers soldering circuit boards in his fathers garage attracting an investor (Dermot Mulroney) who would facilitate mass production and unveiling the Apple II at the first West Coast Computer Fair a machine that would launch the companys future. But Jobs fares far less well at getting under the mans skin. His wildly temperamental mood swings his bizarre reaction at the news that his girlfriend (Ahna OReilly) is pregnant his increasingly short patience with his employees and the cruelty with which he treats the friends who were with him from the beginning all go unexplained. The intimation is that Jobs like many other geniuses might have suffered from some sort of mental disorder. And because the film has so much ground to cover there are huge gaps in the narrative that beg for a little more detail (such as Jobs relationship with his daughter who he refused to acknowledge for many years and then suddenly appears to be living with him no explanation given). Still the mechanics of Apple as a business --  the failed product launches (such as the infamous Lisa computer) and the boards gradual revolt and eventual coup detat of Jobs-- are surprisingly compelling if only because the companys products are so prevalent around the world today. The upcoming big-budget adaptation of Walter Isaacsons bestselling biography of Jobs which is being written by Aaron Sorkin and will reportedly consist of only three 30-minute scenes shot in real time may fare better at capturing the essence of the man. Jobs is technically proficient at recounting the late icons career but it never manages to get inside his head -- or his heart.

Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. Its a quietly dazzling performance. More News First Look at Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs All Stories >> As a movie Jobs is a decidedly mixed bag. Director Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote) and newbie screenwriter Matt Whiteley check off boxes in Jobs life like theyre connecting the dots. Oddly the film doesnt include Jobs 2011 death from pancreatic cancer at 56. The film kicks off in 2001 (Jobs introing the iPod) and works back to his career start. Its as if Kutcher were starring in the thinking mans version of That 70s Show. Jobs the barefoot hippie and Reed College dropout sets up shop with his geek buds in the California garage of his adoptive parents. Thats where he and Steve ""The Woz"" Wozniak (Josh Gad) create Apple and start a revolution. Jobs loses the business. Then he wins it back. It plays like a Jobs Wiki page including young Steve kicking his girlfriend Chrisann (Ahna OReilly) to the curb and initially disowning their daughter. The kick comes in watching the man at work where his blunt style wins few friends but real respect. Kutcher rising to the occasion makes every moment count. The skilled Gad looks eager to take him on but the Woz is a painfully underwritten role. Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesnt. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat.

"Ashton Kutchers half-finished Jobs lacks drama review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAshton Kutchers half-finished Jobs lacks drama reviewAshton Kutchers careful imitation of Apple visionary Steve Jobs isnt enough to keep this biopic interesting.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 15 2013JobsStarring Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney and Lukas Haas. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. 127 minutes. Opening Aug 16 at major theatres. 14AIt would likely vex the egocentric Apple computer visionary and design guru Steve Jobs no end to hear this but the best part of Jobs is not the title character. Rather its Josh Gads portrayal of engaging nerd and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak that adds the often-missing heart and dramatic heft.Ashton Kutcher clearly put Jobs under the microscope to mimic his ape-like tippy-toe popping walk and pursed-lip enigmatic smile. The Two and a Half Men star not only got the speech patterns and flowing hand gestures down he spent a couple of day in hospital after suffering the debilitating effects of following Jobs bizarre fruitarian diet.Article Continued BelowBut the novelty of impersonation soon wears off to reveal Jobs the movie as little more than a made-for-TV-calibre biopic intended to help cement a kind of sainted legacy in a most superficial fashionDirected by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote) and written by Matt Whitely in workmanlike style Jobs takes us from Jobs college dropout days in 1971 to the iPod launch in 2001.Its a lot of ground of cover and Jobs suffers as a result as the filmmakers hop from scene to scene without offering insight into the reasons why Jobs became such a driven man an isolated visionary who had no problems shuffling off those who showed him nothing but loyalty.At an overlong 127 minutes the film tests our patience in various ways with an overlong trippy acid-fueled scene and too-talky boardroom struggles that stop whatever flow Jobs has.A few scenes bring hints of the nature of Jobs the man but without explanation or context. Its like scrolling through messages on an iPhone yet never opening them.Jobs demanding nature surfaces early as he butts heads with his boss at Atari in 1976 and Appleheads will drool over the scenes in the Jobs family garage as Jobs Woz Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) and a handful of others create the first Apple computer in an exciting blast of creativity.Jobs self interest shows from even the earliest stages as he keeps the bulk of the profits from the first computer boards creator and tech whiz Wozniak.Talk of stock prices at 19 cents will make audiences chuckle and the 1970s soundtrack fits nicely with the bellbottoms feel. Clearly making sure Jobs hits the right historical notes was high on the filmmakers list as evidenced in a closing montage of the real characters beside the actors playing them. We get glimpses of Jobs selfishness hair-trigger temper and impatience with those who failed to share his vision. But its not until a late-night meeting with Wozniak that the film shows some heart as Wozniak explains why he helped found the company he was now leaving.For the first time Woznick voices his true feelings about Jobs. That the tech god could only reply to his painful soul-baring soliloquy by asking ""What do you want from me?"" says more about Jobs that the previous 90 minutes of the film.There is inspiration to be found here and messages about conviction and principles -- if being principled means holding steadfastly to never being mediocre rather than the ethics of admitting paternity of his daughter Lisa.The filmmakers are not shy about portraying Jobs feet of clay but seeing more of the reasons behind what made this complex often-infuriating genius behave as he did would have brought Jobs to a more satisfying place.Instead we have a film that can be described using a term that Jobs spits out with palpable distaste as ""the worst thing you can say"" about anything undertaken by Apple ""Its fine.""Read more about AppleThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

As a result most viewers will go into Jobs a biopic about the Apple co-founder and black-turtlenecked guru of the technocratic age knowing two fundamental things about him that he was a visionary perfectionist obsessed with melding technological form and function into products that would tickle the hearts and minds of the people who used them; and that he was so possessed by that mission that he could be a control-freak dictator a fanatic an over-the-top jerk. Still watching Jobs with its basic warts-and-all accuracy and shrewd unsweetened performance by Ashton Kutcher (who was obviously cast because he looks like Jobs but who bites into the role with his incisors) I was surprised and frequently compelled by what a starkly honest portrait it is. The movie opens in 1974 when Jobs is a shaggy barefoot college dropout. He picks up on the inventiveness of his friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) who has figured out how to hook up a keyboard to a television monitor. Jobs then fast-talks (or is it strong-arms?) his way into a deal to sell 50 of these contraptions to a local retailer. Theyve got just two months to build the machines and the film neatly re-enacts the eager-beaver geek-in-the-garage intensity that is the founding image of the home-computer age. When Wozniak a burly nerd who works on this stuff mostly so that he can feel like one of the guys takes out his trusty soldering iron to attach transistors to a flat green board Jobs channels the early paradox of computer culture that to us the gizmos seemed light virtual magical but to the people who invented them they were built diode by diode. At the same time almost everything we see Jobs do that doesnt involve designing computers is unconscionable. Hes so possessed with getting his company off the ground that when his girlfriend announces shes pregnant he treats it as an imposition something he had nothing to do with and he develops the (pathological) conviction that the child isnt his. At work his inspirational mission statements begin to teeter into harangues. As the movie goes on Jobs evolves from a grouchy hippie to a corporate sharpie in three-piece suits and Kutcher lets his voice get more and more crisp with grandiosity so that hes not talking hes lecturing because hes the only one who grasps the inner truth of computer design as transcendence. He runs Apple as if it were an est seminar. Anyone who isnt a fellow true believer is out the door. (Even most of the true believers dont get stock options.) Like The Social Network Jobs is a technology yarn thats really a high-wire business story. The essential tale it tells is that Steve Jobs in the years after he founded Apple became so obsessed with creating the perfect home-computer product that he turned into a bad businessman tossing away millions of dollars in research and bogging the company down while he fetishized perfecting the Macintosh. A lot of the movie is about his battles with executives board members and John Sculley (Matthew Modine) the CEO he hires away from Pepsi. They all start off as Jobs comrades and end up his enemies. Im a sucker for these kinds of big-money power faceoffs and Joshua Michael Stern the director of Jobs stages them well yet with a one-thing-after-another quality that doesnt allow any one character to become somebody we care about. Dermot Mulroney plays Mike Markkula the original investor in Apple who sticks by Jobs for two decades and ends up getting thrown over the side. I guess were supposed to be drop-kicked by this the way we were by Mark Zuckerbergs lack of personal loyalty in The Social Network but the comparison just reveals the difference between the two films. In The Social Network the human drama behind the founding of Facebook is volcanic. In Jobs Gads deadpan flip performance as Wozniak strikes the most relatable note in the movie but the only thing were really arrested by apart from the spectacle of Jobs bad behavior is seeing him talk about computers. The ironic thrust of the movie is that Jobs humanity is there in that perfectionistic insanity. He pushes and pushes to make home computers more and more appealing accessible and user-friendly and thats his great gift to the world. Jobs gets tossed out of his own company because hes too far ahead of his time. (Ultimately of course he came back to Apple and triumphed.) Getting ousted must have been devastating but Jobs doesnt really take us on that personal journey with him. The movies fall-and-redemption narrative is generic abstract. And maybe thats because the reason that this movie even exists -- the notion that Steve Jobs is The One Who Changed Our Lives -- has been to put it mildly a little overhyped. He didnt invent the personal computer although he did refine it into something more seductively handy and even beautiful. Personally Im a devotee of Steve Jobs products but even as Jobs sticks to the facts of Jobs life (and what a difficult person he could be) the movie gets a little too caught up in his legend.

This is not a typo. The dude from Dude Wheres My Car? (2000) is portraying the tech wizard who transformed personal computers and thus our modern world. Sure Kutcher is the king of Twitter and its no more ridiculous than say casting Mickey Rooney as young Thomas Edison--but really?? Wisely director Joshua Michael Stern kicks off this look at the mans life at the 2001 Apple Town Hall Meeting in which Jobs introduced the iPod. Our first glimpse of Kutcher as the older more seasoned gray-bearded icon doesnt just confirm that he can ape the appearance and the loping gait of Jobs 2.0; the actor nails the look in the mans eyes a penetrating glance that suggests hes simultaneously chasing rainbows and sizing up weaknesses. Its an inspired move. You instantly believe this guy could be a cosmically sloppy hippie dreamer and put the Mac in Machiavellian. Youre ready to follow the star anywhere he takes this chairman of the motherboards. Unfortunately Kutcher is taking him through the hoops of a rote here-goeth-the-great-man tale albeit one that makes a point of showing us that Jobs was both genius and jerk-off. All the marks are hit The early garage days with Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) here treated as a chubby wisecracking Costello to Jobss Abbott; the eureka moment of coming up with the name Apple; the risks the successes the failures the hubris (""Hes great...but hes a time bomb"") Jobss ouster and reinstatement as CEO. But while were reminded of what Jobs did theres little insight into why he did it. The film thankfully doesnt offer some pop-psychology Rosebud to explain Jobss drive or near-sociopathic perfectionism yet we walk away knowing nothing about what made this revolutionary tick. He deserves a 360-degree portrait. What you get is a mini recap of a pioneers life--a biOpic shuffle.

"Jobs 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Jobs 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Jobs Bad to fair 2.5 stars Director Joshua Michael Stern.Cast Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney.Rating PG-13 for some drug content and brief strong language. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Jobs Josh Gad makes most of sidekick roles Qamp;A Ashton Kutcher talks about becoming Jobs By Kerry Lengel The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Aug 14 2013 124 PM When Ashton Kutcher first walks on-screen as Silicon Valley icon Steve Jobs the resemblance is uncanny. This is an older graying Jobs walking with a slight stoop. Casually dressed and mellow as your grandpa hes about to announce the release of Apples iPod the thousand-tunes-in-your-pocket device that will revolutionize two industries popular music and consumer electronics. Then facing a small auditorium of fervent disciples he opens his mouth and ... Ashton Kutchers voice comes out. The goofy Valley Boy voice from ""That 70s Show"" and ""Two and a Half Men"" that sounds like every word he says was written in Zapf Dingbats. Boing Boing Boing If it werent for his voice Kutcher would have been the ideal choice to star in ""Jobs"" a well-meant but ultimately unsurprising biopic. The affinity between the actor and his character is more than just physical Kutchers boy-toy looks and airhead persona disguise a sharp intellect that propelled him to a successful second career as a high-tech entrepreneur. But watching him on the big screen in his most challenging role to date theres just no escaping his essential Kutcherness. It makes you wish the theater were equipped with a mute button and closed captioning. Not that he doesnt give it the old college try. Working to capture his subjects evolution from barefoot hippie idealist to ruthless corporate titan and then to something in between Kutchers performance is studied and effortful epitomized by the hunched-shoulders tic that he overuses throughout the film. Such actorly affectations may be a reflection of the journeyman work of director Joshua Michael Stern who resorts to shopworn techniques as a hallucinogenic montage to speed through Jobs college years and a soundtrack of familiar hits to make the passage of the decades. Yet the deeper problem with the film is that it doesnt really add anything to the established narrative on its subject. The personal-computer revolution kicked off by Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was well-covered in the documentary ""Triumph of the Nerds"" and in ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" the excellent made-for-TV movie from 1999. And the hagiographic tributes that came out after Jobs death in 2011 have been thoroughly deconstructed in accounts of his monomaniacal freakouts. Stern and screenwriter Matt Whiteley go out of their way to underline the latter aspect of Jobs personality showing him cheating his friends publicly berating his employees and disowning his daughter before shes even born. But in trying to render his life story in all its complexity the film fails to find a particular point of view. In short its no ""Social Network."" Still it has its moments. The look on Kutchers face when hes trying to conduct a business meeting in his living room and his mom serve PBJ sandwiches is priceless. And roly-poly actor Josh Gad famous for his role in Broadways ""The Book of Mormon"" is adorably nerdy as Wozniak the technical genius who loves and admires Jobs but doesnt share his relentless ambition. And of course there is no denying this story is a compelling one. ""Jobs"" may be by-the-numbers filmmaking but its a serviceable biography of a complex man whose visionary ideas changed the way we live.

"Review Jobs does not compute - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Jobs does not compute Ashton Kutcher plays the late tech titan and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in the biopic ""Jobs."" Mark Olsen The most compelling figure to emerge in ""Jobs"" is actually not Steve Jobs. ""Jobs"" opens with a scene of technology entrepreneur Steve Jobs introducing the iPod in 2001. As the Apple Inc. co-founder makes his way to a small stage he passes ads for his own company that feature images of Einstein Gandhi and Bob Dylan. For the next two hours the film remains about that unsubtle in its attempts to portray Jobs as a genius for the ages.The movies awe-struck attitude is even more odd and unconvincing considering that the film actually doesnt shy away from portraying its subject as ruthless overbearing and generally self-centered. Yet somehow his ability to oversee the development of shiny new things and speak in koan-like platitudes makes all sins forgivable. In the first part of the film for instance he refuses to acknowledge his own daughter. Later on she just pops up on his couch without explanation. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern ""Jobs"" stars Ashton Kutcher in the title role and is -- apart from that opening scene -- focused on the era from 1971 to 1991 covering the formation and early days of Apple Jobs ouster from the company and his eventual return to it. First-time screenwriter Matt Whiteley has melded personal and corporate history in his script in a way that leaves the film feeling strangely without a center.PHOTOS Ashton Kutcher in Jobs As such ""Jobs"" becomes something of a life told in product launches. The film doesnt seem particularly interested in assessing Jobs impact on how we live our lives now nor does it get us any closer to understanding or appreciating the man himself. (If youre looking for a rumination on how technological innovation can be a harbinger of societal change the recent ""Computer Chess"" makes the point with far more grace and insight.)Early in the film a montage shows a college-age Jobs dropping acid sitting in on classes in design and typography and standing in a field waving his arms as if conducting a symphony. The overly long movie could be shortened significantly just by trimming the number of times Jobs is seen staring off intently or walking alone. Because hes you know thinking. At times Stern stops just short of showing a light bulb blinking over his head.Kutcher has apparently done quite well by himself as an investor in technology startups helping get companies such as Skype and Spotify off the ground. Perhaps he sees himself as some Jobs-ian visionary in the tech world but as an actor hes still Ashton Kutcher. Though Kutcher does throw himself into the role with all hes got trying to capture Jobs distinctive walk and mercurial temperament his performance comes off as an assemblage of mannerisms with no deeper feeling or understanding.PHOTOS Remembering Steve Jobs | 1955 - 2011 Late in the film Kutcher stands with his thumb to his chin in obvious emulation of the photo used on the cover of Walter Isaacsons widely read authorized biography of Jobs. (Isaacsons book itself is being adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin who won an Oscar for ""The Social Network"" another personal/tech biopic.)The most compelling figure to emerge in ""Jobs"" is actually not Steve Jobs but rather fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak played by Josh Gad. The dynamic strictly between the two of them - a jousting match over innovation ethics and ambition - would seemingly make a sharper more perceptive movie unto itself.""Jobs"" feels curiously out of touch with its subject both as a man and regarding his impact. There was a time when the slack storytelling stock characterizations and general by-the-numbers feeling of the film could be put into perspective by saying it seemed like a TV biopic. But even TV movies are done with more verve than this these days.mark.olsenlatimes.com -------------------------JobsMPAA rating PG-13 for some drug content and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesPlaying In general release  PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Steve Jobs Entertainment Movies Jobs (movie) Ashton Kutcher Apple Inc.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Steve youre an asshole"" someone says early in Jobs a point the film reinforces repeatedly over the course of its 122 minutes as if to counter the inspirational music and dramatic monologues that riddle it. For (nearly) every yin of Ashton Kutchers Steve Jobs flashing a moment of brilliance theres a yang of someone saying hes changed or is his own worst enemy. The unwritten but understood full title of Joshua Michael Sterns film is Jobs Brilliant Asshole. Stern (Swing Vote) had his work cut out for him. Although his movie hits theaters first it does so under the shadow of another more anticipated biopic penned by Aaron Sorkin and based on Walter Isaacsons bestselling biography of Steve Jobs. Isaacson had Jobs full cooperation for the book and Jobs professed to being a fan of Sorkins. On the other hand Ashton Kutcher resembles Jobs so theres that. He doesnt do a bad job. Kutcher clearly prepared for the role but his capital-A acting distracts from some of his more dramatic scenes. He has the Apple founders onstage mannerisms down pat though he walks with a lurching gait has an intense stare thats almost homicidal and adopts a voice that sounds more like Steve Jobs via Owen Wilson. His co-star Josh Gad fares better portraying Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak--the highest profile victim of Jobs maniacal single-mindedness--with tragic vulnerability. There are many other important figures but the script by newcomer Matt Whiteley barely has time even to mention them in passing or offer much context for some of the seemingly big events happening onscreen. Aside from the opening scene of Jobs announcing the iPod to the Apple staff in 2001 the film stays deep in the past moving from Jobs wayward college years to his early professional troubles to the first years of Apple. It ends with his return to the company in 1996 a decade after his ouster. That brief scene with the iPod excepted little in Jobs will register with people unfamiliar with the mans story or Apples history pre-2001. Stern probably figures everyone knows that part of the story but even seemingly important events from the past--like the failure of the Lisa computer and Jobs post-Apple company Next--come and go with little explanation save for the old ""let news clips provide exposition"" trick (or alternately the ""out-of-nowhere voiceover from the protagonist explaining an important theme"" one). People who have read Isaacsons book can fill in the blanks but everyone else may be left wondering. Steve Jobs lived an extraordinary complicated life thats too much for any one film to capture. The first biopic to take a stab at it gets points for ambition but ultimately feels like a made-for-TV movie mistakenly playing at the multiplex.

At an overlong 127 minutes ""Jobs"" paradoxically feels like its rushing through Jobs life and times never capturing the mans contradictory nature or satisfyingly placing him in a specific historical context. The movie tells us that he liked Bob Dylan and hated shoes he stabbed some friends in the back and had some big ideas but it never provides any true insight into the man. Nor does it fully capture the revolutionary impact that the home computer had on the world. See video Ashton Kutcher Looks Like Kelso Acts Like Steve Jobs in First jOBS Clip What were left is a bunch of standard biopic highlights accompanied by music cues that are either on-the-nose hit songs of the recent past or John Debneys underscoring which tends to turn the proceedings into Disneylands Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. After an opening scene in which the older Jobs (played at every age by Ashton Kutcher) announces the invention of the iPod the movie jumps back to 1974 when rebellious college dropout Steve takes the advice of a supportive professor (James Woods) to audit classes in various departments to stimulate his varied interests in the arts and electronics. Steve drops acid (in a hilarious cliched sequence) Steve goes to India and then Steve goes to work for Atari where he annoys his co-workers and his superiors even though they all acknowledge his genius. After passing off the work of his buddy Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) as his own and seeing Wozniaks creation of a computer keyboard that hooks into a television screen thus allowing the user to see his work as he enters it Apple Computers is born in Jobs parents garage. See video Ashton Kutchers Jobs Becomes First Trailer to Debut on Instagram After a slow start things get rolling when investor Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) makes the scene and from there ""Jobs"" hits all the career highlights youd expect from the success of the Apple II to the debacle of Lisa to the lawsuit against Microsoft to his expulsion from Apple and eventual return to the fold. And while first-time screenwriter Matt Whiteley avoids hagiography -- Jobs treats devoted friends and lovers like dirt -- this is the sort of movie where people go around making declarative statements about their wants and desires and philosophies in ways that no human being does. (The movie also climaxes with the creation of the iMac those candy-colored eyesores from the turn of the millennium whose main impact on the culture was the iFruity character in the comic strip ""Fox Trot."") Theres some discussion about Jobs having been abandoned by his birth parents but beyond that theres no effort to get into his head to explain or even suggest a motivation for his behavior. All that ""Jobs"" leaves us with is a jerk genius. Kutcher to his credit doesnt downplay the jerk part but he never has that moment where the performer disappears into the real-life character hes playing. The fact that his efforts to mimic Jobs pronunciation pattern fluctuate from scene to scene underscores all the acting hes doing which is a big distraction. Even with an army of character actors on hand (including J.K. Simmons Kevin Dunn Lukas Haas Matthew Modine Lesley Anne Warren Elden Henson and Ron Eldard to name just a few) ""Jobs"" really belongs to Gad whose Wozniak is the brainy vulnerable and human heart of the film. Its the most restrained screen performance to date from this Broadway star and one that proves hes got more gifts than just playing to the back balcony. Director Joshua Michael Stern (""Swing Vote"") clearly revels in the period detail of the last several decades but he never conveys the importance of Steve Jobs to those same years. Instead hes given us the Zune of movie biographies. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

With ""Jobs"" Kutcher hopes his performance is as much a lesson about entrepreneurship to todays youth as it a profile of a man who revolutionized technology. (AP Photo/Sundance Institute Glen Wilson) ( Glen Wilson ) Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in ""Jobs."" (Glen Wilson/MCT) ( Glen Wilson ) Related StoriesAug 12Ashton Kutcher Steve Jobs and the making of JobsSteve Jobs was an often inspiring always intriguing figure in American culture who went from college dropout to high-tech icon. Along the way he reshaped the daily lives of most Americans and turned Apple into a major driving force in the U.S. economy.He also was a mercurial complex human being full of not-always-pleasant contradictions. As Walter Isaacson wrote in ""Steve Jobs"" ""there are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy and thats the truth."" If you go to ""Jobs"" -- the new film from director Joshua Michael Stern (""Swing Vote"") and first-time writer screenwriter Mark Whiteley -- looking for insights into what made Jobs tick or why a man with such flaws became such an inspiration you will come away disappointed. The movie is not nearly as bad as many connected with Apple (directly or through their devotion to its devices) may have feared. But if a development team at Apple had cooked up this product Jobs would have rejected it out of hand.Rather than trying to wrap up the entire history of Apple which would have required a TV miniseries Stern and Whiteley chose to focus on the years from Jobs days at Reed College in Oregon to the release of the iPod. Its not a bad choice in terms of focus since the Jobs we knew (or more accurately thought we knew) at the time of his death was defined by those years.Advertisement ""Jobs"" devotes a fair chunk of time to the Reed years and how Jobs (a surprisingly good Ashton Kutcher) was influenced by his use of LSD meditation time in India and encounters with both philosophy and the art of engineering. However its not especially effective and things really dont start clicking until Jobs leaves school for a job with Nolan Bushnells Atari.At Atari Jobs often showed up barefoot for work was hygienically challenged and already was being acknowledged as something of a genius who was shall we say difficult to work with. At one point an Atari development manager tells him ""Youre good damn good. But youre an asshole.""Jobs also was ambitious enough not to want to work for somebody. He wanted his own sandbox to play in and found it with the help of Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad who does the best he can with a misconceived role).In one of the films serious flaws ""Jobs"" doesnt give the Woz anywhere near the credit he deserves for the creation of Apple during its beginnings in the garage of the Jobs family home in Los Altos. And with exception of Rod Holt (Ron Eldard) who designed the power supply for Apple II all of the other early Apple employees are simply set decoration.With the help of entrepreneur and former Intel engineer Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) Jobs and Wozniak used the Apple II to build a string of successes that eventually led to the Mac and made Apple an economic force.But with success came shareholders and corporate infighting none of it particularly well-developed. The board ""bad guys"" -- such as venture capitalist Arthur Rock (J.K. Simmons) -- come off as doltish cartoon villains. In ""Jobs"" John Sculley (Matthew Modine) who leaves Pepsi to be the companys CEO registers as bland and ineffectual. He hardly seems the kind of corporate executive strong enough to stage-manage the firing of a company founder with the stature of a Jobs. This film image released by Open Road Films shows Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in a scene from ""Jobs."" (AP Photo/Open Road Films Glen Wilson) ( Glen Wilson ) That of course is what happened in real life with Jobs going off to found NeXT a hardware-software company eventually bought by Apple and to help with the establishment of Pixar. Eventually Apple -- on the verge of financial disaster -- brings him back first as a consultant and then as CEO. The rest as they say is history.This is all incredibly fertile ground for smart filmmaking but Stern manages to make ""Jobs"" only mildly entertaining. There is no depth to the piece and while it might be asking too much of any film to show the ""real"" Jobs it barely hints at the complexity of his ambitions and emotions. It certainly doesnt even begin to capture why in the end Jobs captured the imagination of the world.None of this by the way is the fault of Kutcher who is best known for his comedy roles on television. He really throws himself into the part and manages to sustain a creditable performance as an iconic figure -- never an easy task.But that isnt enough for ""Jobs"" to succeed. Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") currently is working on a script drawn from Isaacsons book. Maybe that film when it arrives will finally capture something of the essence of Steve Jobs.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.JOBS   Rating PG-13 (for language)Cast Ashton Kutcher Josh Gad Dermot Mulroney and Matthew ModineDirector Joshua Michael SternRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Season 7 delayedReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The casting of Ashton Kutcher turns out to be the sole risky element of ""Jobs"" a smooth reasonably engaging but not especially revealing early-years account of Steve Jobs storied career. Offering a creditable take on the 20-year period in which the determined young tech whiz founded lost and eventually regained control of Apple helmer Joshua Michael Sterns biopic avoids outright hagiography but more or less embodies the sort of bland go-with-the-flow creative thinking Jobs himself would have scorned. Widespread interest in the late entrepreneur and his legacy could spark moderate audience interest. Open Road Films will release the film on April 19 about 18 months after Jobs death and exactly 37 years after Apples inception. A brief prologue full of beatific white lighting and overpowering music shows a 46-year-old Jobs (Kutcher) unveiling the iPod in 2001 wearing his signature black turtleneck. Matt Whiteleys screenplay then rewinds back to 1974 shortly after young Northern California native Steve sporting a dark mustache and goatee has dropped out of college although crucially he hasnt lost his intellectual spark or his determination to change the world. Brief early scenes of Steve taking a calligraphy class and traveling to India with his friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) establish the soulful artistic impulse that will go hand-in-hand with the mans later inventions. Spotting an early prototype built by his portly programming bud Steve Wozniak aka Woz (Josh Gad) Steve decides that they should manufacture and sell personal computers under the simple corporate moniker of Apple. Startling as it may seem for iPad-toting members of the audience these events unfold at a time when ""nobody wants to buy a computer"" per Woz. Still with the help of similarly tech-minded friends and a financial investment courtesy of former Intel employee Mike Markkula (a distractingly coiffed Dermot Mulroney) Apple blossoms from a suburban garage operation into a full-fledged company. Depicted as more of an aesthete and salesman than a nuts-and-bolts technician Steve has a clear vision for Apples computer products marked by elegant streamlined design and intuitive user-friendly interfaces. Yet the downside of Steves visionary leadership soon begins to assert itself. ""Youre damn good but youre an asshole"" someone tells him early on and sure enough Steves stubborn uncompromising nature leads him to devalue close friends and colleagues and run afoul of board member Arthur Rock (J.K. Simmons) who becomes determined to wrest control of the company away from its founder and chief innovator. To their credit Stern (""Swing Vote"") and Whiteley seem intent on rendering their subject in as many complex layers as possible emphasizing not only the mans temperamental confrontational streak but also his particularly callous treatment of the women in his life. In a version of events that pointedly excludes such sensitive personal matters as Jobs adoption (John Getz and Lesley Ann Warren make brief warm appearances as his parents) the story takes pains to include scenes of Steve dumping his pregnant girlfriend (Ahna OReilly) and initially refusing to acknowledge paternity of their daughter. If these moments are intended to suggest the cruel emotional withdrawal needed in order for genius to flourish they unfortunately make the point in overly blunt and obvious fashion. This emphatic quality plagues the film as a whole which too often drives home ideas and character insights through intense but cliched speechifying (""Steve you are your own worst enemy"" and ""Youre either with me or against me"" are among the heavier examples). Sticking close to its subject and unspooling its story in brisk linear fashion ""Jobs"" boasts little in the way of fresh angles or context and provides scarcely a glimpse of the outside-world impact of the tech revolution as led by Apple IBM Microsoft et al. The film relies too heavily on ones foreknowledge of the mans life and work the expectation being that viewers will be able to fill in the storys necessary gaps and draw the appropriate life lessons from it. Yet its precisely that familiarity with Jobs who reached iconic status in the years before his death that often undercuts the effectiveness of Kutchers carefully judged performance. Despite the superficial physical resemblance between actor and subject enhanced by thick glasses longish hair and an impressive attempt at vocal mimickry on Kutchers part the illusion never fully seizes hold. Amid the sizable supporting cast the strongest impressions come courtesy of Gad as Woz providing some gentle comic relief as well as a sensible counterbalance to his friends suffer-no-fools impatience and Mulroney as the angel investor-turned-board member who does his best to stand by Steve in difficult moments. Ultimately ""Jobs"" is a prosaic but not unaffecting tribute to the virtues of defiance nonconformity artistry beauty craftsmanship imagination and innovation qualities it only intermittently reflects as a piece of filmmaking. Freddy Waffs production design and Lisa Jensen-Nyes costumes subtly capture the look of each decade; the soundtrack blares too insistently with some of Jobs favorite artists including Cat Stevens and Bob Dylan.

Daily Edition Login to download jOBS Sundance Review 219 AM PST 1/26/2013 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A biopic thats perhaps too respectful of the tech icons innovations still remains frequently engaging. TWITTER Ashton Kutcher stars as the legendary inventor and entrepreneur who converted a generation of computer users to Apple products. PARK CITY -- Playing rather like a two-hour commercial covering the first 20 tumultuous years of Apples development Joshua Michael Sterns biographical look Steve Jobs is a passably entertaining account of the career of one of the 20th centurys great innovators that breaks no new stylistic ground and hews closely to the public perception of the tech giant. Open Road will release jOBS nationwide April 19 to mark Apples 37th anniversary. The three-month marketing push began at Sundace and positive word-of-mouth could turn out more viewers than just the faithful and curious. International sales are a given considering Apples global reach. PHOTOS Steve Jobs 10 Memorable Milestones of the Apple Co-Founders Career Selecting a biographys starting point is always a critical decision for both content and pacing and debuting screenwriter Matt Whiteley identifies Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) early-70s Reed College education -- cut short when he drops out shortly after enrolling -- as the first critical juncture in his later career. Art classes meditation LSD trips and travel to India all contribute to Jobs brief higher-education experience leading to a job with pioneering video game manufacturer Atari in Silicon Valley. Jobs and self-taught computer engineer Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) co-found Apple Computer to manufacture the Apple I computer kit in the formers parents Los Altos garage. They soon follow up with the Apple II one of the first consumer-market personal computers to include a video display released in 1977 with funding from entrepreneur and former Intel engineer Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney). Jobs focuses on advancing the platform eventually launching the Macintosh computer in 1984 after having taken the company public four years earlier at the incredibly reasonable IPO price of 22 a share. The offering makes Jobs and Wozniak instant multi-millionaires though it cuts into some of Apples key original employees. An internal feud with CEO John Scully (Matthew Modine) sparks Jobs departure from Apple in 1985 and the start-up of the computer hardware and software manufacturer NeXT. By then Wozniak also had left Apple. As the company falters with various unsuccessful research and manufacturing projects in the late-80s Apple brings Jobs back as an adviser and eventually makes him CEO. Stern wraps up the movie at this climactic point with Jobs again directly associated with the brand he established and on the cusp of introducing the line of ""i"" computers communications devices and entertainment products now so familiar to consumers. PHOTOS Ashton Kutcher Gets Steve Jobs Makeover By accentuating the sweet spot that combines the Apple origin story with the drama inherent in Jobs struggles to grow and maintain control of his company Whiteley and Stern get a good return on their investment but at the expense of some important details including Jobs initial introduction to Wozniak and any specifics about Wozs personal history. As the two are developing the first Apple computers the omission of any discussion about the operating-system software needed to run the machines also is puzzling. While the emphasis remains on Jobs career the film also touches on some less-than-savory aspects of his personal life including his rejection of pregnant girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and repudiation of his daughter Lisa in his early 20s. And jOBS doesnt gloss over the mans reputation for unwavering perfection direct speech and tempermentalism. In his first produced script screenwriter Whiteley -- director of marketing content at producer Five Star Films parent company -- exhibits a tendency to accord too much deference to his subject thereby sacrificing the critical perspective and complexity that better-developed supporting characters could provide. Sterns directing style represents an extension of this reverential approach bathing Jobs early years in a pervasive golden hue while shifting the blocking in later scenes to emphasize Jobs at all costs. Camera setups and shot selections are functional but tend to be fairly static sacrificing a sense of dynamism. VIDEO Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs Kutcher has the intitial advantage of a reasonable resemblance to Jobs but goes beyond this to faithfully re-create some of his mans physical mannerisms. He manages a fair imitation of Jobs speaking style as well particularly when delivering a number of monologues and often while haranguing his employees or board of directors. Gad could have profitably been given more to do in the Wozniak role particularly since the many boardroom scenes might seem repetitive. Mulroney and Modine are adequate in the other significant supporting roles but dont have much to do aside from offering foils for Jobs ambitions. Production designer Freddy Waff and composer John Debney conspire to lend authenticity with suitable period details and music well-modulated to each new period of Jobs career. The filmmakers do fall into the trap of overly sentimentalizing a widely beloved public figure who represents an enormous cultural significance. At the same time however they keep the movie frequently engaging an indication of their studious dedication to the project about a man who arguably changed the habits and communication methods of the worlds population more than any other.
