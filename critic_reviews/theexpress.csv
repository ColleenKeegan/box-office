Take Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy in 1961. Playing at a time when most college-football teams were lily-white Davis (Rob Brown) faces open racism from opponents and subtler racism from his coach (Dennis Quaid). Its a great story but the movie has to bend a few things not least when fixated on the uplift director Gary Fleder has to rush Daviss ending - he died of leukemia before playing in the NFL.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Express The Ernie Davis Story   (out of four)Stars Dennis Quaid Rob Brown Omar Benson Miller Darrin Dewitt Henson Charles S. Dutton Nicole BehaireDirector Gary FlederDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG for thematic content violence and language involving racism some sensualityRunning time 2 hours 9 minutes Opens Friday nationwide By Mike Clark USA TODAY The Express recalls a bittersweet fantasy that football fans of a certain age have never forgotten For a brief moment Syracuse University superstars Ernie Davis and Jim Brown were set to play in the same Cleveland Browns backfield. But Davis died at 23 of leukemia in 1963 a year after the racially dunderheaded Washington Redskins dealt him their No. 1 draft pick and the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy to the Browns. WATCH THE TRAILER Go out on the field with The Express GAME ON BLOG West Virginians angry over depiction in The Express The ending isnt unique to the ""disease"" subgenre of sports movies. The Express though has more on its mind. Its an entertaining race-laced contest of wills between Davis (a solid Rob Brown) and coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) just after Browns graduation. On balance the movie portrays Schwartzwalder as amicable toward Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson whose portrayal is not intimidating enough). But the coach also has to deal with Browns dating of white women a big deal in the late 1950s. Though Schwartzwalder wasnt a racist he was old-school. What he found in Davis was a running back akin to Jackie Robinson a straight arrow determined to stand up for himself. Quaid is lean and grouchy in a showy role In one scene he barks to his team that hes not prepping them to play the New York City Ballet Company. Despite appealing performances and kinetic football scenes the storytelling is mostly conventional except for two outstanding set pieces. One is a 1959 Syracuse-West Virginia contest in which Morgantown fans rain debris from the stands. Another is the ugly 1960 Cotton Bowl against Texas for the national championship in which late hits crooked refs and a brawl were the apparent order of the day. I met Davis in 1962 when I was 14 and I still have his autograph so I was probably more keen than many to see this movie. But The Express is being promoted the way studios do when they think they have a crowd-pleaser and certainly its a better family movie than a lot of junk hyped as such. It would be nice to see a kinescope of that Cotton Bowl game on DVD. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Syracuse University halfback Ernie Davis was the first black athlete to win the Heisman Trophy collegiate footballs highest honor. He died of leukemia in 1963 before he had a chance to play in the big leagues with the Cleveland Browns. In ""The Express"" Daviss story is milked for every drop of inspirational uplift. As performed by Rob Brown Davis is such a bland stand-up guy that our attention inevitably switches to Daviss head coach played by Dennis Quaid in full gruff mode. A little orneriness goes a long way in this movie. ""The Express"" may prove valuable to movie historians since its a compendium of virtually every sports movie cliche ever contrived.

"The Express Tale of an American hero | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Express Tale of an American heroIt just wouldnt be autumn without an inspirational football movie to accompany it and The Express moves the pigskin briskly without fumbling it.Rob Brown stars as Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis in The Express.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 10 2008 The Express (out of 4)Starring Rob Brown Dennis Quaid and Omar Benson Miller. Directed by Gary Fleder. At major theatres. PG It just wouldnt be autumn without an inspirational football movie to accompany it and The Express moves the pigskin briskly without fumbling it.Whether thats enough to attract audiences outside the gridiron set remains to be seen. A film about Ernie Davis the first African-American to win college footballs Heisman Trophy is far from a guaranteed touchdown since Davis is unknown even to many ardent followers of the game.With a game-changing U.S. election on the horizon however there couldnt possibly be a better time for a story about a motivated man of colour who excels despite setbacks and prejudice even if the tale cant approach the legend of baseballs Jackie Robinson (whose significant breaking of the ball diamond colour bar is referenced more than once).This is not to demean Davis whose life was shortened by tragedy. But it does limit how far director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls) and screenwriter Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) can go especially since most of the action occurs in the late 1950s before the civil rights movement took hold in the U.S.Fleder and Leavitt stick to the formula basics relying on good casting to see them through. Rob Brown (Stop-Loss Coach Carter) is the picture of the relentless striver overcoming family struggles (hes raised by his grandpa played by Charles S. Dutton) blatant racism (football helmets also serve to deflect flying bottles) and physical limitations (he stutters).Davis finds a surrogate father figure in Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid no stranger to inspiration sport movies) a gruff coach who persuades the young talent to join his Syracuse University team in the New York border burg even though the town is anything but a football mecca. Schwartzwalder has an ace up his sleeve in the person of Jim Brown (Darrin DeWitt) a former protege who went on to greatness as a professional player and who sees some of himself in Davis.Once Schwartzwalder has Davis firmly under his command he pushes him harder than the youth ever expected causing Davis to doubt the wisdom of the deal. ""About now youre wondering what happened to that nice gentleman who came to your house and asked you to play for Syracuse"" cracks his burly teammate Jack Buckley (Omar Benson Miller) who provides welcome comic relief. But greatness beckons nonetheless and even the dour Schwartzwalder learns a thing or two about being the best you can be.Aptly named The Express plows through any subtleties of storytelling ticking all the boxes of this genre of movie. Theres a little bit of romance a lot of well-choreographed football action and enough motivational speeches (""Dont you let anyone steal history away from you"") to fill a Dale Carnegie book.The illness that robbed Davis of a long career is also given due respect gratifyingly not milked as much as it could have been. When Davis finally wins the Heisman a prize long considered out of reach for non-whites President John F. Kennedy recognizes the achievement with a personal meeting and a stirring telegram of congratulations.It makes you wonder how much stronger the movie might have been had the JFK angle been played up since he reportedly followed Davis with great interest.Everything moves so briskly in the film theres barely even mention that the title refers to Davis nickname shortened from The Elmira Express. But consider that a virtue in a movie content to teach familiar messages without overstating them.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rob Brown in ""The Express"" about Ernie Davis the first African American Heisman Trophy winner. Photo Chuck Hodes Universal Pictures Movie review The Express 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Express Sports drama. Starring Rob Brown Dennis Quaid and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by Gary Fleder. (PG. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Listen to Arts amp; Entertainment Editor Leba Hertzs podcast with Rob Brown at sfgate.com/ZEYX. If youre a fan of the increasingly predictable sports movie genre you could probably write a commercially viable version of the Ernie Davis story yourself. Start with a stubborn but talented athlete in this case the first black man to win the Heisman Trophy. Add a before-his-time civil rights pioneer coach and fill the stands with Confederate flag-waving Southern rednecks. Be sure to include at least one morbidly offensive lineman for comic relief and have everyone break into a male-bonding song and dance in the locker room. (This film takes place in 1961 so ""I Will Survive"" wont work. What about something by the Temptations?) ""The Express"" isnt a perfect movie but it deserves plenty of credit for abandoning the ""Remember the Titans""/""Glory Road"" school of screenwriting as laid out above and exploring the racial issues in Davis story in more realistic terms. The player coach and even the wise grandfather figure played by Charles S. Dutton have at least one more dimension than the typical sports-movie stereotypes. The most memorable performance comes from Dennis Quaid who carefully portrays Syracuse University coach Ben Schwartzwalder as sort of an accidental civil rights hero. Quaid sounds as if he smoked 47 packs a day to prepare for the role and his gravelly voice and Tom Landry wardrobe threaten to make Schwartzwalder a caricature. But theres depth in the character who must challenge his own racist inclinations which werent that strong to begin with but may not be totally gone at the end of the film. Davis arrived at Syracuse in 1959 a year after Jim Brown set records at the school. The Pennsylvania native didnt have the same game-changing pro career (or a Hollywood resume including roles in ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""Im Gonna Git You Sucka"") that Brown enjoyed so he isnt a household name. But he was one of the greatest college running backs of all time helping his team win the Cotton Bowl in 1960 and winning the Heisman a year later before leukemia halted his chances at NFL stardom. Rob Brown stars as Davis and the Amherst College wide receiver-turned-actor is more convincing on the field than off. His character has so many challenges to overcome - a speech impediment his need to make social change and a hamstring injury among them - that theres little time for Brown to delve into the running backs motivations. Davis is a triumphant figure but you dont get to know him as much as youd like. He fights racism with spin moves and leaping catches more than any of his actions off the field. Darrin DeWitt Henson is much better as Brown who lurks in the wings of the stadium like the superhero that he was during that time. Once you get past the fact that Henson looks nothing like the former Cleveland Browns running back his performance is almost as enjoyable to watch as Quaids Screenwriter Charles Leavitt still owes the world 7.75 - or whatever a movie ticket cost in 2001 - for his role in the ""K-PAX"" atrocity but this movie is a good start to making things right. A scene where Schwartzwalder uncomfortably asks Davis to stop hanging around white co-eds is appropriately tense and disturbing. And along with the complex themes the movie provides more than its share of stand-up-and-cheer moments. Veteran television director Gary Fleder and his editors and cinematographer dont reinvent the genre but they include a mix of period filming sepia-toned interludes and real-life news footage that is never distracting. The 129-minute running time borders on ridiculous especially in the anticlimactic final 20 minutes which could have been conveyed just as easily with a postscript. Another problem is the scenes where Davis plays youth football which look like they were designed by the choreographer of Rudys Pop Warner football game on ""The Cosby Show."" (Players dont even get a hand on Davis - they just collide into each other and fall to the ground.) Its strange because the football scenes later in the movie are excellent. Under all those pads Rob Brown looks and moves just like Reggie Bush. As for Quaids Schwartzwalder he doesnt have a 21st century equivalent. Maybe its because of all the smoking warnings but coaches just dont sound that badass any more. -- AdvisoryFootball violence strong language and one awkward bedroom scene that reminded me of that creepy part in ""Armageddon"" where Ben Affleck sweet-talks Liv Tyler while he caresses her body with animal crackers.

Joe Neumaier Thursday October 9 2008 1155 AM Sports biodramas generally take one of two tacks gauzily sentimental or scrappy tale of struggle. ""The Express"" runs the thin line between the two and to its benefit more often than not hits the first mark. But thats also the source of the films problems since Ernie Davis historically important years as a college football great were built on adversity.Beginning with a few scenes of his boyhood in Uniontown Pa. where his loving grandfather (Charles S. Dutton) emphasizes the importance of Jackie Robinson the movie dashes to Davis (Rob Brown) recruitment out of Elmira N.Y. by Syracuse University and head coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) who senses the fast-charging Davis could rival his last superstar NFL-bound Jim Brown.RELATED DENNIS QUAID CALLS MEG RYAN ""UNBELIEVABLE"" But Davis wants to stand on his own. His whole life he was an optimist who saw everything including institutionalized racism as a hurdle he could leap with a huge grin and a lot of heart. His gridiron accomplishments even wear down Schwartzwalders grizzly persona.By the time ""The Elmira Express"" wins the Heisman trophy in 1962 - the first black player to do so - Davis seems to be held down by very little. Then some mysterious ailments keep him off the field and by the time he announces he has leukemia in the summer of 1962 his never-started career with the Cleveland Browns is already over. Less than a year later hes dead at age 23. Director Gary Fleder (""Runaway Jury"" ""Kiss the Girls"") thankfully avoids maudlin ""Brians Song""-type moments - Davis death is revealed in an end credit - and he and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau go for the antique candy store/ collectors card look a la ""The Natural"" which works well. Theres also a gripping Cotton Bowl matchup in Texas and a harrowing game played before a violent intolerant crowd in West Virginia.But the movies bow to conventionality undercuts much of the cultural-historical truth Fleder clearly feels many sports movies lack. And though Brown is a winning engaging hero the script gives him few chances at becoming flesh-and-blood (his romance with a pretty visiting co-ed is an afterthought and completely devoid of passion).Quaid who buries his football eatin grin under a scowl and dodders around like John McCain does a solid but textbook take on the grumpy coach with a hidden heart. Sadly however this is all too familiar which is something nobody could say about the real Ernie Davis.

Thanks to the gruff-but-fair-ness of his only mildly racist coach (Dennis Quaid borrowing Kevin Costners look from ""JFK"") Davis took the team and his own career to places where even Brown whose number he wore had not gone. Lots of uplifting music and isnt-this-dramatic camera work (half the games seem to take place in either total darkness or stabbing rains) take things exactly where you expect them to go until a surprisingly effective and emotional climax. If youve got only one really good act save it for the third. Otherwise this is a zero-surprise story strictly warm milk for the soul. As a youngster being raised by his loving grandfather (Charles Dutton) Ernie marvels at the sight of Jackie Robinson playing baseball on TV - and just to make sure we get the point Ernies reflected face gets superimposed over Robinsons. During his rise Ernie says things like ""I wasnt running from I was running to"" (though it sure looks like hes running from racists) and ""I know my place gentlemen - it just may not be where you like it."" Early on we learn that Syracuse has never won a national championship and that no black man has ever won the Heisman Trophy. (Its sort of like when your girlfriend tells you shes never been to Cancun for her birthday and never received a Louis Vuitton clutch for Christmas.) The football scenes dont burst out so much as unfurl majestically. Ernie gets the ball we go to slo-o-o-o motion defenders flail the goal line awaits. Next game same thing. Pass play? Slo-o-o-o mo on the quarterback. The sna-a-a-ap. Ernie da-a-a-ashing free. The ba-a-a-a-all in the a-a-a-air. The coaches on the sidelines the fans watching on TV the quarterback again the receiver again the prayers of a nation the making of history the critic going out for a Coke and . . . . back just in time to see the touchdown. Nearly two hours in we still (apparently) need to be told that Ernie wanted to be ""the best player I could be period."" ""If you practice half-assed you will play half-assed"" says the coach. This movie must have practiced half-assed. Its easy to applaud Ernies gridiron genius even when it stretches credulity (lets see did he really get falsely accused of fumbling by a racist referee intercept a pass and catch an 87-yarder - on consecutive plays?). But the movie might be a bit more interesting if Davis had more to him than simply graceful gumption and victimhood and if the spaces around him could be filled with something. His girlfriend for instance gets about half a dozen lines and seems not to have been issued any discernible personality. At times the film even seems to bore itself. With lines like ""Dont you let anyone steal history away from you"" and ""In light of whats going on in this country do you feel added pressure to represent change?"" ""The Express"" hints that it wishes it were about someone else. THE EXPRESS Scores a few points. Running time 129 minutes. Rated PG (profanity racism brief sensuality).

Legendary Syracuse running back Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) runs for the end zone in The Express The Ernie Davis Story. Photo Chuck Hodes The Express The Ernie Davis Story 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Football is just a game. Its more than just runnin a ball. Its not just a game any more. In Texas its a religion. Twenty-one lines five yards apart -- thats a football game. But there are other lines that run deeper and wider that arent part of any game. All of the above sentiments are expressed in The Express The Ernie Davis Story. They only seem to contradict one another. In any given pigskin saga -- if not on any given Sunday -- someone at some point will suggest that football is only game but as soon as we hear that we realize its not. It never is. The combat on the grass is always part of a larger battle against tragedy adversity or prevailing social mores -- a proving ground where new ideas rush past old ones or pound them into submission. In The Express a sturdy new biopic of legendary Syracuse running back Ernie Davis the real contest is waged against racism. If you dont know a thing about Davis I wont spoil the plot for you here. But if youre already familiar with his story (or saw the trailer) you know that he followed another legendary player Jim Brown as the Orangemens star back. You know that both men strove to become the first African-American recipient of the Heisman Trophy. You know that Brown didnt. As for Davis the film follows him from his boyhood in Pennsylvania and upstate New York through his extraordinary career at Syracuse. It tracks the rocketing arc of a young man so fast so gifted and so unfailingly optimistic that victory seems assured from the outset. By dint of talent he is not an underdog. By dint of race he is. The tension that grips his story isnt a question of will-he-or-wont-he cross the end zone. Its will-he-or-wont-he get sidelined by bigotry -- spoken or unspoken on or off the gridiron. The Express was written by Blood Diamond scribe Charles Leavitt (from Robert Gallaghers biography) and directed by Gary Fleder whose most recent feature film was 2003s singularly preposterous The Runaway Jury. This one isnt preposterous. It has the benefit first of all of being true. (More or less narrative liberties dot the playing field.) But a fine uplifting sports flicks can make us root for fictional underdogs (Rocky) as well as non-fictional (Chariots of Fire) horses (Seabiscuit ) as well as humans (Hoosiers). What matters isnt whether an athlete triumphed in real life. What matters is whether the athlete triumphs where it counts -- on screen scoring points with spectators in the stands -- and by that measure the film can claim an honest victory. The most valuable player? Rob Brown a congenitally likeable young actor who portrayed a high school hoops player in 2005s Coach Carter and now dons the shoulder pads plus the weight of history as Syracuse Universitys fleet-footed number 44. Stomp the Yards Darrin Dewitt Henson does a slow proud burn as Jim Brown the man who wore the number before him. As head coach Ben Schwartzwalder an effectively horn-rimmed Dennis Quaid perfects that cantankerous old-farts glower hes been practicing the last few years. And Omar Benson Miller -- the simpleton in Miracle at St. Anna -- provides welcome ironic pluck as an African-American teammate who helps Ernie navigate on a northern white campus. The Express is acted with magnetism directed with conviction and edited with dash setting Ernies story alongside archival footage from the civil rights era. Its also roughly 20 minutes too long; it peters out after its big emotional payoff when the movie turns reflective and ends on a note recalling Pride of the Yankees. You might need a hankie before its over. As Ernie declares in narration ""Football is just a game. What matters is what you play for."" The Express plays for our sympathy -- and wins. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED October 8 2008 at 1212 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 304 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Early in ""The Express"" elite athlete Ernie Davis meets Syracuse Universitys legendary running back Jim Brown. It is the late 1950s and No. 44 has traveled to Elmira N.Y. to help coach Ben Schwartzwalder recruit Davis for the competitive New York college that has yet to win a championship. The look on Davis face as he shakes Browns hand is pure starstruck. But the scene transcends celebrity gushing. And director Gary Fleder and screenwriter Charles Leavitt know it. ""The Express"" is a celebration of athleticism of course. Based on Robert Gallaghers biography of Davis the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy it is also a tale of character -- individual and national -- and how the one can make better the other. Dennis Quaid brings scowling grit to Schwartzwalder. A tough bird of a coach he butted heads repeatedly with Brown and was in no hurry to recruit another African- American player when the star left for Art Modells Cleveland Browns. But winning wills out. And Davis turns out to be little like Brown temperamentally. Given his performance actor Rob Brown should become a very busy guy. He consistently captures the athletic ambitions and social sensitivities of a young man coming into his own as the nations civil rights movement grew in vigor. Browns Davis has a modulated incandescence. He lights up when he meets Brown. He burns softly when he meets future girlfriend Sarah Ward (newcomer to watch Nicole Behaire). Early scenes show Davis as a kid with a stutter sitting at the table of his grandparents home trying to say grace or recite the Bible. Charles S. Dutton plays Willie ""Pops"" Davis Ernies maternal grandfather. With Pops pushing him in the early years and Jim Brown watching later on ""The Express"" makes a muscular yet subtle statement about mentoring. Brown is there in the stadium bleachers; sometimes hes on the sidelines. But played with contained command by Darrin Dewitt Henson hes never in the shadows. Schwartzwalder was a mentor too. But ""The Express"" and Quaid make a fine point that the Southern-bred coach was also mentored by his upstanding player. Although the movie is rated PG scenes of toxic racism could challenge young viewers. Not a bad thing. But be prepared for ugly moments when the Orangemen travel to West Virginia University (Schwartzwalders alma mater) to play the Mountaineers. By the time the 1960 Cotton Bowl against the Longhorns rolls around Schwartzwalder had learned a thing or two about having his running backs back. This movie works for football fans as well as general audiences up for a heart-provoking family flick. Director Fleder and Co. pay heed to the style of college ball played in the late 50s and early 60s. Guys blocked differently. They also made use of Schwartwalders playbooks for Xs and Os strategy. Physically there were differences. Davis roommate best friend and SU tackle Jack Buckley (based on John Brown) is played by Omar Benson Miller (""Miracle at St. Anna). Hes a big guy but hes still smaller than most NFL fridges freezers and icebergs. ""The Express"" delivers visceral gridiron energy. Fleder and his crew capture the moments so many athletes refer to as ""being in the zone."" Time slows. Noise fades. Action Best theres even a ""one degree of separation"" moment for Bronco lovers. We wont give it away but we can say this Davis was the sort of young man who paid it forward. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com ""The Express"" PG for thematic content violence and language involving racism and for brief sensuality. 2 hours 6 minutes.

"Express doesnt stray from safe playbook - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Express doesnt stray from safe playbook Rob Brown (right with Dennis Quaid) stars as Ernie Davis the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. (Chuck hodes) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / October 10 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + If we continue to need tales of improbably successful athletics programs and life stories of professional athletes to lift us up (and surely weve had enough already) we also need the movies themselves to be distinguishable from each other. But Hollywood has a way of working its magic in reverse so that all the triumph in a story (an over-the-hill quarterback or pitcher comes back; the Podunk team wins a national championship) becomes cynically generic.""The Express"" which opens today joins the club. This movie is especially egregious since it bundles the civil rights era garden-variety bigotry and the achievements of Ernie Davis the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis never played a game in the NFL dying of leukemia a year after signing a contract with the Cleveland Browns. His life may be sad but its inspiring. The drama depicting it is brutally dull two hours of motivational talks (""I never set out to be the best Negro running back. I set out to be the best running back"") stiff performances and game sequences.The movie kicks off like a dutiful term paper. In a voice-over Rob Brown the flat but likable actor who plays Davis tells us how many lines compose a football field and how there are ""lines that run deeper through this country and that arent part of any game."" Its 1949 Pennsylvania and young Davis (Justin Martin) is accosted on train tracks by a gang of 12 white boys. They mock his stutter and abuse him with slurs. But a flash twinkles in little Ernies eyes and he takes off running. God may have made him fast the movie basically says but racism made him faster.Daviss estranged mother (Aunjanue Ellis) moves him to Elmira N.Y. And starting in 1957 coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid pouting and peacocking) will make Davis better yet. Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) drops by on a recruitment mission to tell him so. Brown has just signed a deal to play for the NFL in Cleveland and Schwartzwalder prevails upon his problematic superstar player to talk Davis into coming to play for Syracuse. The movie hints at the complexity of Browns natural truculence and the chip racism left on his shoulder. But ""The Express"" ultimately settles for making him a big glass of tall dark and handsome a neutered personality deployed to spout platitudes.There is so much ripe material here for a socially or historically curious movie. Davis gets to Syracuse while racial conflict roils the South but what was a northern campus like during the civil rights movement besides a living Woolworths catalog? The filmmakers are more interested in making a safely commercial football drama that doesnt deviate from the genres shorthand imagery and plot points.Its entirely possible Davis was a perfect national sensation that he played great Heisman-winning football and then he never did anything else with his days beyond play football and serve as a credit to his race. But he couldnt have been as bland as ""The Express"" makes him out to be. Aside from managing to get made at all the movie doesnt do Daviss legacy any favors by giving us the store-brand version of his life. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Despite its title (Davis was known as the Elmira Express) the film is in fact a pokey local to Schmaltzville.In 1961 Davis was the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy while playing for Syracuse University. He was the top choice in the NFL draft but he never played in the pros dying of leukemia at age 23.So how do you transform what is essentially a tragedy into an inspirational tale? The Express accomplishes this quite handily by accentuating the positive and glossing over the messy parts.For instance the majority of the film is spent dramatizing the 1959 season when Davis (not to be confused with Armys Glenn Davis a prior Heisman-winning white running back) was a sophomore. Syracuse went undefeated that year beating Texas in the Cotton Bowl to claim the schools only national championship.The Express shows not one down from the following two years when the team went 14-5. Still impressive but not the stuff of legends. Conveniently the film vaults right from the Bowl game to the Heisman ceremony.Rob Brown (Finding Forrester) plays Davis with an unvarying but still appealing reverence. Dennis Quaid does a workmanlike job as crusty Syracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder who is slowly won over by Davis quiet determination and dignity. (Clancy Brown who plays Schwartzwalders assistant could probably have done a better job with Quaids role.)Actually the best performances in the film emerge in far smaller roles Charles Dutton as the football players stern but soft-hearted grandfather and Saul Rubinek as color-blind Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell.The 50s-period detail is quite convincing - the football action less so. One of the downfalls of jock films is that while the principal character is always splendidly athletic the casting of everyone else on the field is usually laughable.So it is here. Omar Benson Miller who plays lineman Jack Buckley Davis friend and fellow All-American looks as if he couldnt run five yards if a bus were bearing down on him.The story is told chronologically albeit in stops and starts beginning with Davis early years in the coal-mining burg of Uniontown Pa. where he apparently developed his breakaway speed by running away from homicidal white hooligans. He also overcomes a bad stuttering problem by reading aloud from the Bible.The Waltons wasnt this mawkish.At each level of his playing career Davis is subjected to virulent racism from screaming hometown fans to scheming referees to white opponents who on those rare occasions when they could get him to the ground pummeled him unmercifully after the whistle was blown. (If you root for the West Virginia Mountaineers you might want go out to the lobby for popcorn during Syracuses visit to Morgantown. Its that ugly.)The film takes a wrenching detour during the teams cross-country bus ride to Dallas for its Cotton Bowl appearance. Director Gary Fleder gratuitously jams in newsreel footage of the Little Rock integration crisis and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to underscore how entrenched Jim Crow Laws still were in this period.Like most fact-based athletic films from the 1971 TV movie Brians Song to the 2006 feature Glory Road this bioflic is archly sentimental.The Express eventually reaches its triumph-of-the-human-spirit climax but it yanks too hard on the heart strings during the long journey there.The Express  (out of four stars) Directed by Gary Fleder.

Its such a naturally compelling tale that one wonders why it hasnt been filmed before. Davis battled racism to become the first Black player to win the Heisman Trophy. He was drafted into the pros but died of leukemia in 1963 before he could play. He was 23. Obviously its a meaty story and director Gary Fleder (Dont Say a Word) and writer Charles Leavitt get the job done in capable fashion. But with such good source material it would be hard to screw it up. Davis (played by Justin Martin as a youngster and then Rob Brown) grows up in Pennsylvania before moving to upstate New York with his mother. His athletic skills are obvious early and he stars on the high-school team before being recruited to play for Syracuse University. With hard-driving coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) guiding him Davis becomes a star. It isnt an easy time for Black players; during a harrowing sequence at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas spectators shower bottles and trash on his head when Davis steps on the field. The movie smartly avoids turning the characters into archetypes. Schwartzwalder in particular is portrayed not as some civil-rights pioneer but as a man who simply wanted to win football games. Quaids unsentimental performance keeps the character grounded in realism; its quite easy to not like the coach. Brown (Finding Forrester) also does a fine job imbuing Davis with humor and resolve. As true stories sometimes tend to do Davis may come off as too saintly at times but Brown is always believable. Fleder does interesting things with the look of the film. Davis childhood is shot in almost gray tones; the Cotton Bowl sequence features a bleached-out look that adds to the coldness and intensity of the scene. The movie is told in straightforward fashion except for an extended flashback sequence in the middle. Its an odd choice and throws the film momentarily off course but the harm isnt irreparable. The films final moments dont go for the big Brians Song waterworks; instead its reserved and understated in keeping with the movies overall tone. It is a wise move as it keeps The Express from feeling like a retread. The end result is a football film that will appeal to people who cant tell a halfback from a cornerback.

"Movie review The Express -- 3 of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Express -- 3 of 5 stars Based on a true story ""The Express"" follows the life of college football hero Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. His quiet fight for equality and respect forever changed not only the face of the game but his civil rights story continues to inspire. Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Ernie Davis was the first African-American to win footballs Heisman Trophy. The passage of time and the brevity of his career and life have made him a forgotten figure something the workmanlike football drama The Express aims to change. But its a movie that rarely strays from its sports-drama formula something that robs the history and the tragic trajectory of the mans story of its heart.Davis ""the Elmira Express"" (a better title for the movie BTW) followed Jim Brown to Syracuse University wore Browns number faced racism on campus and when he traveled with the team down South. Inspired first by Jackie Robinson then by his idol Jim Brown Davis (Rob Brown) became racially aware and insisted that his ""dont make waves"" coach ( Dennis Quaid) see what he represented and let him make a stand for racial equality in the America of the early 1960s. ""There are some lines people dont want to see crossed"" Coach Schwartzwalder tells Davis. And for a while hes willing to go along with that. But playing in front of a racist crowd against racist players Davis has an epiphany. He wont let them or his coachs timidity keep him from getting right in their faces. He will pile up the yardage. He will score touchdowns. And you know that when he takes Syracuse to the Cotton Bowl to face Texas America is going to take notice and college football will never be the same.Director Gary Fleder (Runaway Jury Imposter) treats this story with such reverence that he rarely lets us see the flesh-and-blood Davis. Racial strife in the locker room light moments of dating and the many many game sequences are all played at the same ""This is important sports history"" pitch -- very dry. The football games are well-filmed but the movies have done well by football for decades now. Nothing new there. Brown is solid Quaid is aging into a nice curmudgeon Charles Dutton lends a little supporting class (as Daviss grandfather) to the proceedings and Darrin Dewitt Henson suggests Jim Browns chip on his shoulder and his stature if not Browns baritone.Although The Express is a decently crafted movie it fails to generate much heat or emotion which is a let-down considering its Brians Song story arc. Davis deserves to be remembered but as professionally crafted as The Express is the movie is an almost instantly forgettable version of his life.

With his handsome craggy face and likable intensity he was born for the job and hes the main attraction in The Express an overlong 1960s-set biopic of Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) the famous Syracuse running back coached by Quaids gruff (but kinda soft) Ben Schwartzwalder. The movie is structured all wrong -- after the climactic Big Game it rolls on for another 20 minutes -- but Quaid delivers near the end. When Davis becomes the first African- American to win the Heisman Quaids choked-up reaction is the movies high point. Even though it shouldnt be. B?

"Express The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; express-the ) Express The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Express is the latest movie to join an ever-expanding subgenre of the ""sports movie"" category fact-based films that explore the impacts of integration into various contests during the latter half of the 20th century. We have already seen productions like Remember the Titans  Glory Road Pride and The Great Debaters approach the subject matter in ways not dissimilar to those found in The Express. Although this film is more about an individual than a team it emphasizes the difficulties encountered by early athletes of color as they broke barriers and blazed trails. (Its interesting that the best-known representative of this group Jackie Robinson only has a 1950 B-movie to tell his story although there is a new project on the drawing boards.) The Express despite including almost every sports movie clichA(c) known to man tells an engaging and at times powerful tale of one individuals struggle against the system. The film is reasonably true to life although it tweaks real events so they fit a little better into the sports movie formula. The structure is nontraditional with the emotional climax coming about 90 minutes into the story allowing for a poorly focused overlong epilogue that rambles a bit in trying to tie things up by explaining why the title character did not become a household name like his predecessor friend and hero Jim Brown. The action begins on New Years Day 1960 at the Cotton Bowl in Texas with the 1 ranked Syracuse Orange Men taking on the University of Texas Longhorns. The standout halfback of the Orangemen is Ernie Davis (Rob Brown) the ""Elmira Express"" and one of three black players on the team from New York. Ernie is playing in front of a crowd whose partisanship is matched only by its racism. As he stands at the line of scrimmage awaiting the next play Ernie flashes back to events that led him to this point beginning with his childhood outside of Pittsburgh progressing through his recruitment by Syracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid) and finishing with his leading his team to an undefeated season in 1959. Football is a metaphor for life in The Express. Ernies struggles on the field parallel the countrys pains as it lurches unevenly toward equality. Even in Northern cities Ernies skin color earns him stares and cold shoulders. (Witness the scene when he first arrives at the mostly-white campus of Syracuse.) When the Orange Men travel south however he is greeted with open hostility and prohibitions against staying in the same hotels as his white teammates. Although the film is centered on Ernie it also shows the development of Coach Schwartzwalders character. A native of West Virginia with strong negative feelings about blacks Schwartzwalder is shown overcoming his inherent bigotry and becoming one of Ernies defenders. This isnt an actors movie but the principles all do sound jobs. Rob Brown brings a soft-spoken quiet charm to Ernie. The intensity in his eyes defines the performance. When the character refrains from reacting to prejudice around him the volcanic fury in those eyes leaves no doubt as to how Ernie feels. Dennis Quaid the movies biggest name fills a supporting role more than adequately. Theres nothing new in his portrayal of the gruff coach who bonds with his player but Quaid does it well enough. He is familiar enough with sports movies (Any Given Sunday The Rookie Everybodys All American) but this is his first role on the other side of the bench. Charles S. Dutton taking a part originally to have been essayed by Forrest Whitaker has a small but important role as Ernies grandfather. Darrin Dewitt Henson portrays football great Jim Brown who played no small part in Ernies decision to sign with Syracuse. The film is a little scattershot in its presentation of non-football aspects of Ernies life. His relationships with his grandfather and mother are glossed over. The Express intimates a relationship between Ernie and Sarah Ward (Nicole Behaire) but never develops the love affair. The script makes it clear that theyre more than just friends but are they lovers? Engaged? Married? The Express has so much ground to cover in about two hours that a lot of the smaller richer issues that would have fleshed out Ernies character were either excised from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor resulting in a portrait that is skewed and idealized. Nevertheless as a story of courage and inspiration this works as well as any sports-related bio-pic. The difference is that while Ernies on-field accomplishments were extraordinary it was the environment in which he struggled to achieve them that makes him the worthy subject of a motion picture.

Davis who died before ever playing a down alongside Jim Brown for the Cleveland Browns has almost become a footnote--an inspirational fairy tale. Based on a Davis biography Gary Fleders account is a noble attempt at humanizing the myth but it succumbs to the worst sorts of sports-movie cliches Its smash-mouth football scenes play like Gatorade commercials and off the field its characters infuse every casual aside with the dramatic gravitas of History in the Making. To his credit Rob Brown first seen in 2000s Finding Forrester plays Davis with quiet subtlety (to the point where he almost disappears in some scenes). But Dennis Quaid as Syracuses Ben Schwartzwalder is stuck with the thankless role of accidental civil-rights pioneer--the gruff color-blind coach who must nonetheless overcome his own ingrained racism and internalized fears. And like all formulaic biopics The Express sacrifices the details for the Big Picture--hagiography without the humanity (wait is that his girlfriend? Wife? What?) populated by sorta-enlightened Yankees rabidly racist Southerners and a ghost who remains as elusive as the running back no defender could ever catch.

Crowdpleasing and oh-so-predictable ""The Express"" is a muscular movie with social conscience that portrays Ernie Davis -- the first African-American collegian to win college footballs coveted Heisman Trophy -- as the heir to Martin Luther King and Jackie Robinson. Rob Browns performance in the title role is solid and static but Dennis Quaids portrayal of coach Ben Schwartzwalder provides a convincing metaphor for a nation going through a crisis of conscience. The sports theme may define the pics aud but emotional content could provide a crossover punch. Of course its not as if helmer Gary Fleder has a tough argument to make. That blacks were an oddity either in professional or college football as recently as the late 1950s seems as anachronistic as black-and-white TV. And anyone expecting Fleder (""Kiss the Girls"" ""Runaway Jury"") to walk the sidelines of righteous indignation in telling Davis story would probably expect an onside kick by a team up by 30. Fleders most electrifying sequences portray Schwartzwalders unbeaten 1959 Syracuse U. team playing West Virginia and Texas -- not exactly two bastions of tolerance -- with a level of racist vitriol pouring out of the stands that is a topical reminder of Americas racial heart of darkness. ""Keep your helmets on at all times"" Schwartzwalder warns his players during the West Virginia game. Whether its to conceal skin color or protect from flying bottles isnt clear. Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley intermarries the onfield action flashbacks to Davis Southern boyhood a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story Even as a shy boy who stutters (played by Justin Martin) Davis is a prodigy. Elevated to the Varsity by Schwartzwalder during his freshman year Davis thrives under the grueling regime enforced by his coach. ""I bet about now youre wondering what happened to that nice gentleman who came to your house and asked you to play for Syracuse"" says a sweaty Jack Buckley (the terrific funny Omar Benson Miller). Davis agonies will not all be on the field of course but his talent triumphs even over the most racist of his teammates -- such as the belligerent Bob Lundy (Geoff Stults). Fortunately theres also a great deal of humor in the Charles Leavitt script much of it playing off the presumptions and biases of the time. The great Jim Brown has just graduated having been Schwartzwalders greatest star and a thorn in his side. Is it a new trend Schwartzwalder asks an assistant or just his bad luck that the best prospect on his list is a black kid. ""Its a new trend"" the assistant quips signifying a changed era in sports and one Schwartzwalder had better get used to. He does. The development of the coachs character makes ""The Express"" a romance of sorts. Raised by his grandfather (the always brilliant Charles S. Dutton) Davis is vulnerable to exploitation by a father-like figure but the relationship he develops with Schwartzwalder is far more complex nurtured by a common love of the game distanced by the politics of their time. ""The Express"" may have football as its locomotive but theres a long train of national sorrow hope and promise coming up behind. Production values are major league.
