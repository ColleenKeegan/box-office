This review was updated on August 10 2005. The plausibility factor is zero but the entertainment quotient runs fairly high in nimble actioner ""The Transporter 2."" Effortlessly transplanted from the South of France to Miami sophomore installment in what looks like a viable franchise has rip-roaring chase scenes inventive combat interludes and a beginning a middle and an end. Slick kidnapping yarn starts off like a bat out of hell and never sags. Pic should do decent biz on home turf in Gaul (it opened Aug. 3) rolling out Stateside (Sept. 2) and beyond. Scripter Luc Bessons mind may mimic the ""shuffle"" function on an iPod but the playlist that emerges here has a good beat and your eyes can dance to it. Nobody who actually enjoyed 2002s ""The Transporter"" is likely to feel let down by current effort. Jason Statham is back as dapper and taciturn title character Frank Martin an ex-Special Forces operative turned driver-for-hire who transports things for a fee with rigor and discretion. Franks sheer lethal coolness is nicely established in first five minutes when he removes his freshly dry-cleaned suit jacket before laying to waste a quartet of formidable would-be car-jackers. Franks filling in for a chauffeur buddy and his cargo for the last month has been young Jack Billings (Hunter Clary) the only son of U.S. anti-drug czar Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine) and his trophy wife Audrey (Amber Valetta). Franks sensitivity and powers-of-observation are demonstrated when having picked Jack up from school he tactfully drives past the boys parents to conceal their argument-in-progress from the likeable tyke. Audrey and Jeff are semi-reconciled after a years separation. Jeff is out of touch with his son but viewers are given enough clues to know that Audreys a great mom and Franks as good at handling kids as he is at out-maneuvering any and all comers from the latest multiethnic sale at Thugs R Us. Frank promises little Jack hell never let anybody hurt him. Thats on Friday. On Saturday morning Frank drives Jack to his annual medical checkup so Audrey can set up a surprise birthday party. But psychopathic hellcat Lola (Kate Nauta) and Russian virologist Dimitri (Jason Flemyng with a Boris Badenov accent) have neutralized the receptionist and real doc and taken their places. Theyre working for aggressively fit baddie Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). The plan is to inject Jack with a deadly custom-made virus exchanging the antidote for a hefty ransom from the Billings even heftier personal fortune. When Jack is abducted the authorities suspect Frank must have been in on it. And after some very muscular research -- including a chase between a jet ski and a bus -- Frank learns that Gianni is a very bad man whose real target is much bigger than one little boy. Each set piece ups the ante with Franks technique for removing an explosive device from the chassis of his car particularly resourceful. Mano-a-mano fistfight on a pilotless private jet spiraling in free fall (for a really long time) is ridiculous but fun to watch. Moviegoing cats will be jealous as Frank has obviously been issued way more than nine lives. Comic relief consists of a visit from jovial French police inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand) who as in first pic begrudgingly admires Franks discipline and professionalism even if hes deduced the Brits not living entirely off his military pension. Besson plays to the international gallery with a few funny digs at French stereotypes. Thesping is more than acceptable for this kind of genre fare. Gassman photographed to tower over Statham makes a truly creepy villain. Nauta is effectively slutty as the literally killer babe who feels overdressed in anything more than a garter belt and see-through bra and who hates to go more than an hour without icing somebody. Statham continues to convince as the enigmatic but resolutely can-do Frank. Final line of dialogue implies hell be back. Locations brim with industrial menace and tech work is fine with helmer Louis Leterrier (""Danny the Dog"" aka ""Unleashed"") sustaining a breathless but not confusing pace. For those poised to accuse Besson of an originality deficiency this is almost certainly the only French pic ever to thank Gov. Jeb Bush in its closing credits.

"Transporter 2 Jason Stathams Going Places washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Transporter 2 Jason Stathams Going Places When Statham is at the wheel ""Transporter 2"" zooms along; without him on-screen it stalls. (20Th Century Fox Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 2 2005 I dont know what ""it"" is but I know whos got ""it"" and who doesnt. I dont for example. You dont either. He doesnt she doesnt they dont. Out here in the real world there is no ""it."" ""It"" is a movie thing and Jason Statham star of the otherwise low-IQ sub-13-year-old fantasy ""Transporter 2"" has got ""it."" When he drives a car from the 18th floor of one building to the 10th floor of another building (and he didnt even know the second building was there ; he took it on faith) or declines kissing a woman so beautiful itll make your gums ache or double-scissors-kicks two large men with necks the diameter of bridge cable and makes you believe it thats ""it."" Statham isnt the best thing in ""Transporter 2""; hes essentially the only thing. Its his charisma vs. the World. Score Statham 2 World naught. Hes an Englishman -- balding lithe focused -- discovered by director Guy Ritchie who cast him in ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" and now hes doing better than Ritchie. Plus hes not married to Madonna. This film repeats but amplifies or rather inflates the formula of its predecessor ""Transporter."" Its blown up so big and bright its like a worlds fair combined with an auto show and a square dance. Statham again plays Frank Martin a former special operations trooper who now delivers things for a living. He is very good at delivering things especially when certain people dont want those things delivered. Hes a driver a fighter a shooter. The movies necessarily therefore involve large amounts of driving fighting and shooting. In this one -- the plot seems stolen from ""Man on Fire"" -- hes signed on to deliver young Jack Billings (Hunter Clary) to and from school in posh Miami every day. Jacks dad (Matthew Modine) seems to be the head of the DEA. Since DEA is headquartered in Washington that part didnt really make much sense. In any event it turns out that some very bad folks fronted by a charismatic bad guy named Gianni (played by Alessandro Gassman) want to kidnap the boy then use him as leverage for another larger far more destructive plot. Everything they do involves at least 30 extras and half the guns in Miami (each extra carries about nine). Somehow a batch of Russians is involved as is Giannis screwball girlfriend Lola who looks like she checked in from Stanley Kubricks Droogs-R-Us milk bar in the next block. Lola carries two Glock machine pistols and is forever giggling and ventilating simultaneously. Shes played with some zest by Katie Nauta who may actually be pretty and talented under the oil slick of eye makeup spatulad onto her orbital cavities. But all of that really merits only a big so-what. The plot is stupid and obvious. Amber Valletta as Jacks mom is a Cameron Diaz look-alike with -- this is hard to believe -- even less talent and when Statham isnt on-screen youll be trying to remember that brief crazy month of 1984 when Modine was considered a movie star. The rest is Statham mesmerizing dominating fascinating. Get this guy into a good movie and youll have something really cool.

You could envision the two fooling around to old Barry White CDs or sipping champagne from a shoe. Katie Nauta (left) tries to use to her feminine wiles to break the unflappable Jason Statham in Transporter 2. 20th Century Fox But somewhere on the road from most action movies to their sequels objects of affection tend to vaporize. And besides Statham as super-chauffeur Frank Martin really hasnt much of a romantic dimension. More tightly wired than G. Gordon Liddy he remains despite fleeting hints of a twinkle in his eyes the human equivalent of the starch in his shirts that never wilts even during martial arts dispatchings. In Transporter 2 Statham is solo as he drives a cute rich kid to and fro while staving off occasional googly eyes from an underloved mom (Hitchs Amber Valletta). Although not without its entertaining moments the result is so over the top that well never again be able to look at Denzel Washington and Dakota Fannings identical setup in Man on Fire without chortling. The kid (Hunter Clary) is targeted for trouble because dad Matthew Modine (also tightly wired) is a national drug czar whom a Miami drug runner (Alessandro Gassman) wants to ""take out"" Pat Robertson-style. How? By kidnapping a spread-by-injection virus and lots of artillery expended by a scantily clad model-esque assistant with freakish eye makeup and a trampy spirit (Katie Nauta). About the movie Transporter 2   1/2 (out of four) Stars Jason Statham Alessandro Gassman Amber Valletta Matthew Modine Katie Nauta Director Louis Leterrier Distributor 20th Century Fox Running time 1 hour 28 minutes Rated PG-13 intense sequences of violent action sexual content partial nudity and brief language Opens nationwide Friday She is something -- not the kind of girl youd take home to mom unless mom is Heidi Fleiss. Car chases and physical bouts are impressively staged although by todays standards a few of the special effects display what you might call ""Ed Wood wobble."" Even with his acting lockjaw and lots of nonsense Statham makes an oddly appealing protagonist one reminiscent of that high school coach or assistant principal whos always in slightly better shape than the top jock in the class. The only difference is the beard stubble that most schools probably wouldnt allow their faculty to sport. It appears as if Statham buys his follicles at the same shop Bruce Willis gets his. But certainly this is a movie for fans of Willis-style action with a little James Bond and probable instant obsolescence thrown in.

Directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. 88 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violent action sexual content partial nudity brief language. Several theaters. Ever since ""The Transporter"" became a surprise hit three years ago Ive been telling anyone whod listen that action movies need more guys like Jason Statham. The balding British hunk made his debut in Guy Ritchies ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" but it was his ""Transporter"" role -- as ex-Special Forces operative driver-for-hire and lethal gentleman Frank Martin -- that made Statham a star. Tom Cruise recruited Statham for a cameo in ""Collateral"" and in 20 seconds of screen time Statham almost made you wish he was the star of that film. While boy-men like Orlando Bloom and Colin Farrell turn historical epics (""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Alexander"" respectively) into epic flops Stathams the real deal. James Bond would gladly buy him a martini shaken or stirred. Now comes ""Transporter 2"" (""a follow-up film was not unexpected"" reads the press kit) and while its a routine full-throttle action flick set in Miami Stathams still got the goods anchoring the mayhem with charisma and white dress shirts to spare. ""Transporter"" writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen havent even tried to come up with an original plot this time but if Statham ever gets a decent script his improving box-office clout will go ballistic. Then again you dont expect credibility from a movie that exists solely to give action fans 88 minutes of mindless diversion. Whether hes serving as producer co-writer or director of bullet-ridden hits like ""The Professional"" Besson knows that the genre thrives on the defiance of reality with injections of humor to acknowledge the absurdity. And where John Woo uses white doves as a trademark Besson (in producer mode here) has a reliable fetish for anorexic supermodels like Kate Nauta appearing here as Lola lithe and lethal with raccoon-eye mascara a slinky Samp;M wardrobe and twin guns ablazing. If she doesnt get an action figure millions of overnight fans will demand one. Oh and shes not shy with her tongue. Lolas employed by the slick narcissist Gianni (Alessandro Gassman son of the late Italian star Vittorio Gassman) a preening piece of Eurotrash hired by the Colombian drug cartel to eliminate the U.S. drug czar (Matthew Modine taking an easy paycheck) by kidnapping his 6-year-old son injecting the kid with a deadly virus then releasing him so Modine will catch the bug and pass it along to all attendees of a historic anti-drug conference. And Frank? Just so happens hes chauffeuring the kid as a favor to a friend and Modines neglected wife (the lovely Amber Valletta) is only too eager to express her thanks which Frank politely declines -- hey the mans got ethics. The kidnapping turns Frank in his indestructible Audi A8 into a one-man retaliation squad with ""Transporter"" cop Tarconi (Francois Berleand) arriving from France for comic relief and too-easy access to FBI databases. ""Transporter 2"" is franchise hackwork easily dismissed but adequately enjoyable. Another follow-up will not be unexpected.

Starring Jason Statham Alessandro Gassman Katie Nauta and Matthew Modine. Directed by Louis Leterrier. (PG-13 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Before buying a ticket for ""Transporter 2"" audience members must first consider how serious they are about the basic laws of gravity fundamentals of inertia and almost every other lesson contained in a freshman physics textbook. Because there are driving scenes in this film that make the unfinished overpass bus jump in ""Speed"" look completely realistic by comparison. No joke -- at one point a sedan with a bomb on the undercarriage launches into the air and does a corkscrew and the hanging hook from a crane is used to defuse the device while the car is upside down. And that looks like documentary footage compared to the movies airplane sequence. If you can get past the impossibilities -- and we know its a lot to ask -- ""Transporter 2"" is a fun time at the movies. Made by the same producer-director-screenwriter team responsible for the excellent ""Unleashed"" the latest adventure of Frank Martin suffers from sequel-related maladies. But the film still delivers plenty of action and a few laughs while bringing back underrated actor Jason Statham at his brooding best. In a world full of action stars who are either too pretty (Brad Pitt) too creepy (Nicolas Cage) or acting-challenged (the Rock) Statham is a welcome throwback. As mercenary Frank in the original ""Transporter"" Statham found his ideal role a tough loner with a glimmer of humanity like an old- time gunfighter. Even with his English accent you could easily see this actor riding with ""The Magnificent Seven."" French producer Luc Besson (""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Professional"") cant match the budgets of the Bruckheimers or Spielbergs but he always hires top- tier martial arts choreographers and stunt performers. It seems as if theres a little less mayhem in ""Transporter 2"" than Bessons previous Frank Martin film but choreographer Cory Yuen makes the most of every violence-drenched moment including a memorable five-minute smackdown involving water hoses fire axes and lots of kicking. At its best the movie is kinetic and stylish -- imagine if Jackie Chan were the next James Bond. But as the plot unfolds problems develop. More sensitive this time around Frank has moved to Miami and at least temporarily halted his no-questions-asked courier business instead using his tricked-out Audi touring sedan to chauffeur a drug czars kid to school. Young actor Hunter Cleary holds his own in his first role and screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen (""The Karate Kid"") makes the most out of their limited time together. But the moment the bond is established the kid is removed as part of a complicated kidnapping-ransom deadly-virus plot. From there Franks dealings are with the boys annoying parents (including Matthew Modine in a politician role usually played by Bruce Davison) and a cadre of standard-issue bad guys including a female assassin who looks like a cross between the aforementioned Nikita and the Brigitte Nielsen character in ""Beverly Hills Cop 2."" The only actor who comes close to keeping up with Statham is the great Francois Berleand who reprises his ""Transporter"" role as Franks police nemesis -- conveniently heading to Miami for a vacation. While the Frenchman provides mostly culinary-related comic relief (""You wouldnt believe what passes for food in this place Frank"") hes consistently funny and provides a welcome break between the logic-defying car chases. Did we mention that a car jumps between two skyscrapers with no apparent damage to its power train? Isaac Newton may be rolling in his grave but that doesnt mean the rest of us cant have a good time. -- Advisory This movie contains violence profanity and a child held at gunpoint. It also includes violations of Archimedes Principle Newtons first three laws and other stuff that less famous scientists discovered hundreds of years ago.

"Fast furious and sillybut fun in a Bond way - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bond Fast furious and sillybut fun in a Bond waymovies - reviewSeptember 2 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticA new Bond? Who cares? Who needs Bond?Weve got The Transporter.The second installment of this French-engineered Brit-starring Hong Kong-styled action series is more slam-bang and much sillier than the original. It loses some of The Transporters lean mean minimalism and crosses right over into Bond far-fetchedness in its plot and stunts. But its still a noisy goofy cartoonishly violent ride.This time our transporter played by bullet-headed rule-spouting Jason Statham is running his particular brand of delivery service in Miami. But this methodical super-skilled ex-Special Forces getaway driver has been reduced to taking a rich kid to and from school.At least hes teaching the boy (Hunter Clary) ""the rules.""""Respect a mans car and the man respects you.""He tells the kid hell never let anything happen to him. He tells the kid to never make a promise you cant keep.And then the kid is kidnapped.Our transporter is kind of warm for the boys mom -- ex-model Amber Valletta. Shes depending on him because her drug-enforcement politico hubbie (Matthew Modine) is useless.But what can you do when an international terrorist ""with perfect syntax"" (Alessandro Gassman) is bent on doing something with a virus to the kid and maybe the rest of Miami?You get to transporting thats what you do. Statham with the aid of stunt doubles chases bad guys and is chased by the feds all over sexy pre-Katrina South Florida. Cars JetSkis a helicopter and a private jet come into play.The transporter relentlessly tracks the bad guys with the aid of the French cop (Francois Berleand brought back for comic relief) all with an eye toward a showdown with another model murderous and ever-undressed Lola played by model-actress-singer Kate Nauta.Casting in these movies is for effect. The first one had a Chinese director and Asian overtones. This one has the same martial-arts director Corey Yuen so the fights are even more spectacular. They work because Statham an ex-Olympic diver can remake himself into a British Jet Li -- call him Brit Lee.But this Transporter is all about design -- from the slick Audi our driver works over on the job to the always rain-slicked indoor parking garages (makes for a cool illogical look) to producer Luc Bessons thing for emaciated models. He directed La Femme Nikita and The Professional and married and tried to make a star out of model-actress-singer Milla Jovovich. He cast Valletta and Nauta two non-actresses with perfect cheekbones all jutting lines and overstyled hair and little flair for acting.Gassman the son of Italian actor Vittorio Gassman makes for an interesting ""type"" saddled with a loony story of Bondian pretensions.Transporter 2 is like the original loaded with action fun. But a recent re-viewing of The Transporter on DVD shows that reduced to TV size the plot springs leaks and the brawls car boat and plane crashes look like what they plainly are -- fake.If you really want to be transported by this one better see it on the big screen.

"Transporter 2 delivers fewer thrills than first film - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Transporter 2 delivers fewer thrills than first film By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 2 2005 Its been three years since we last ran into Frank Martin. Hed made quite an impression in The Transporter"" as a one-man delivery service for the underworld speeding all over Europe in his black BMW breaking bones barely speaking and eventually freeing dozens of Chinese slaves from a trailer. He stopped to make love to a dame. He embarrassed her prissy father. And on one occasion he took out a crew of thugs while covered in crude oil. Those were good times. And under only the direst circumstances should they be regurgitated.But because in the movie industry you can always have way too much of a good thing here comes Transporter 2"" a sequel that makes it clear that the outrageous antics of the first movie had a one-time-only charm.Frank drives an Audi now and hes traded Europe for Miami where in this sequel all he transports is a strangely articulate tot from home to school. Holy Noggin network Its not exactly plowing your car into passersby along the French Riviera but really what is? As played by the impenetrable Englishman Jason Statham Frank is still coolly fastidious even while chauffeuring a boy who cant solve his riddles. But Frank is also a little pathetic. Transporter 2"" has him engaged in a new line of work you would expect from Transporter 8.""Nonetheless when the usual clan of extremely fit hypersexual Euro baddies kidnaps the boy Frank speed-walks to the rescue. Who he finds is a greedy Italian villain worthy of a Die Hard"" spoof. Yes Alessandro Gassman plays the part with relish and every other condiment at the snack bar Hes not acting; hes hot-dogging. And hes having a good time with this fiendish throwback. (Honestly is it fashionable any longer for a villain to ask that a 5 million ransom be paid in nonsequential 100 bills?)When the boy is returned after 35 minutes we know theres more bad news to come. And Frank is there to uncover it along the way rebuffing sexual advances from the boys mother (Amber Valletta) and the villains lethal weapon of a girlfriend (Kate Nauta). Sorry ladies hes all business. Your son is infected with a deadly virus"" he tells the kids mother. Now anyone who comes into contact with him is going to die.""According to the Russian scientist who whipped it up the virus is a recombinant double-morphing"" something or other -- the accent lost me. But that infected child is just the start of a dopey plot that among other nonsense requires Matthew Modine who is worse than usual as the boys daddy to do quite a lot of coughing.The film provides occasions for Statham to knock us out as he gracefully knocks off anonymous goons with kicks and props (look out for those watermelons). He does all this while wearing his drivers get-up of a black suit and tie over a crisp white shirt. One assortment of nasties is swept into a dumpster. Another is put away with a fire hose that the indestructible Frank turns on only as a finishing move. But Franks impossible ditching of a bomb aside the movie lacks the spectacular sense of the ridiculous that made its predecessor so special.The screenwriters of both movies Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and the director of the first Corey Yuen assumed that wed seen it all and kept trying to pop our eyes from our heads with a campy plot and formidable stunt craft. This sequel is what you find in a Tupperware container spinning in a microwave. The director Louis Leterrier is not as ruthlessly efficient as either Yuen or his hero. He throws in too many rinky-dink clumsily edited car chases and several fight scenes with as much pow as flat soda.The first movie didnt have a spare moment to peek in the rearview mirror. On too many occasions in this sequel the camera stops to rubberneck at the pileups and cars crashed in slow motion. What had the makings of a crisp confident action vehicle comes down with a case of the Cannonball Runs. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

He is a stocky ordinary-looking Englishman who doesnt come off all that swift. But as the ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin the impeccably dressed blank-faced professional driver in ""The Transporter"" and now ""Transporter 2"" with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond hes struck gold with a franchise-spawning role. The part allows for the exhibition of some impressive martial-arts skills (he performs almost all his own stunts) while requiring very little in the acting department.After relocating to Miami from the dreamy French seaside where the Euro-chic first film was set Frank accepts a short-term assignment chauffeuring a wealthy familys young son. But before long the boy for whom Frank has developed a soft spot is kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus intended to be passed along to his self-absorbed father (Matthew Modine in an exceedingly thankless role) and his drug-enforcement colleagues. Frank whose life is governed by his own strict set of rules vows to save the boys life and proceeds to do whatever it takes (the more insanely implausible the better) to keep his word while being aggressively pursued by the police who believe Frank is in on the crime.Taking over directing duties from Cory Yuen who was responsible for ""The Transporter"" and did the martial-arts choreography here is Louis Leterrier -- clearly the right man for the job. In addition to serving as artistic director on the first installment he also collaborated with the writer-producer Luc Besson on the Jet Li vehicle ""Unleashed"" released earlier this year.Though both ""Transporter"" films are driven by the same empty-headed video-game slickness ""Transporter 2"" surpasses its less focused predecessor on almost every level. There are no traces of a romance subplot which bogged down the first film freeing up space for even more car chases and fight sequences. And the French cop Tarconi (Francois Berleand) the closest thing Frank has to a friend is back with a more consequential role helping track down the abducted boy and making up for Franks lack of charisma. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Purely shallow but never dull the film wisely pushes the limits of absurdity to the extreme making it easier to submit to its sheer camp. But even with all thought processes deactivated its hard to tolerate the main female baddie (the newcomer Kate Nauta) who struts around in lingerie and red stilettos toting large guns while delivering one of the worst performances since Milla Jovovich another clothing-deprived supermodel-turned-actress appeared in Mr. Bessons ""Fifth Element.""""Transporter 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
