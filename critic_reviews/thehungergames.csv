By David Denby Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in the adaptation of Suzanne Collinss young-adult novel ""The Hunger Games.""   Credit Illustration by Andre Carrilho Suzanne Collinss ""The Hunger Games"" (the first book in a best-selling young-adult trilogy) is a sensational piece of pop primitivism--a Hobbesian war of all against all. In a dystopian society in the future a group of wealthy epicene overlords--authoritarians with violet hair and the vicious manners of French courtiers--threaten and control an impoverished population. Years ago the virtuous commoners rose up unsuccessfully against their decadent rulers and theyve been both cosseted and terrorized ever since by a yearly lottery in which two teens from each of twelve districts are selected trained and turned into media stars. They are then set loose in a controlled wilderness where they must survive hunger and one another until only one of them is left alive. The survivor will bring home to his district both glory and food and everyone rich and poor watches the events on television. Collinss idea seems to be derived from the bloodier Greek myths and Roman gladiatorial contests (the big shots have names like Seneca and Claudius); from William Goldings ""Lord of the Flies""; and from TV spectacles like the myriad ""Survivor"" shows and sado-Trumpian elimination contests. Collinss strategy of putting girls and boys (some as young as twelve) at the center of a deadly struggle adds tense nasty excitement to the old tales and tawdry TV rituals she draws on. Trying to explain the trilogys extraordinary popularity critics and commentators have reached for metaphors. Perhaps its that the books offer a hyper-charged version of high school an everyday place with incessant anxieties constant judgment by adults; hazing bullying and cliques; and finally college-entry traumas. If you stretch the metaphor a bit the books could be seen as a menacing fable of capitalism in which an ethos of competition increasingly yields winner-take-all victors. Collins might seem to be one of those victors herself there are twenty-four million copies of the trilogy in print in the United States alone. But maybe the reason for its success is simple it makes teens feel both victimized and important. Collins understands her audience well and she can write. Her first-person narrator Katniss Everdeen who hails from a shabby coal-mining area is a tough resourceful girl a huntress who protects her family. Collins staying inside Katnisss head produces short tactile sentences that are precise about apprehension and physical experience. However fanciful the basic premise the books are rugged girls adventure literature of the kind that used to be written for boys. Making an exciting movie out of ""The Hunger Games"" should not have been that hard. I certainly have no quarrel with the casting. Jennifer Lawrence demonstrated a convincing strength as Ree the Ozarks girl with a husky voice and pale-blue eyes in ""Winters Bone."" In ""The Hunger Games"" as Katniss--a more dynamic version of Ree--she has a lightly burnished copper complexion and when shes still theres something luminous slightly otherworldly about her. Her gravity and her steady gaze make her a fine heroine. And I enjoyed nineteen-year-old Josh Hutcherson as Peeta the other competitor from Katnisss district who adores her; he has a lost look an engaging not-quite-handsomeness. In true young-adult-fiction style Katniss has a second admirer--stalwart gentle Gale played by Liam Hemsworth who looks in this movie like a larger Taylor Lautner. Among the adults Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks wearing enormous wigs camp it up as the rulers. Though the satiric point of making some of the plutocrats monsters out of an eighteenth-century farce eludes me the actors try hard for vulgar panache and they perform with professional skill. But the rest of ""The Hunger Games"" is pretty much a disaster--disjointed muffled and even at times boring. Collins herself labored on the script along with Gary Ross and Billy Ray and Ross (""Pleasantville"" ""Seabiscuit"") directed. Working with the cinematographer Tom Stern Ross shoots in a style that I have come to despise. A handheld camera whips nervously from one angle to another; the fragments are then jammed together without any regard for space. You feel like youve been tossed into a washing machine (dont sit in the front rows without Dramamine). Even when two people are just talking calmly Ross jerks the camera around. Why? As the sense of danger increases he has nothing to build toward. Visually hes already gone over the top. And the action itself is a thrashing incoherent blur--kids tumbling on the ground or wrestling with each other. Katniss stalks various kids with her bow and arrow but she kills only one intentionally--a domineering sadist--and you dont see the arrow hit him; you dont even see him fall. Ross consistently drains away all the tensions built into the grisly story--the growing wariness and suspicion that each teen-ager must feel as the number of those still alive begins to diminish or the horror (or glee) that some of them experience as they commit murder. The camera rushes through the wilderness but in the end the movie looks less like a fight to the death than like a scavenger hunt. Katniss is always finding something useful in a tree or lying on the ground. ""The Hunger Games"" is a prime example of commercial hypocrisy. The filmmakers bait kids with a cruel idea but they cant risk being too intense or too graphic (the books are more explicit). After a while we get the point because children are the principal audience the picture needs a PG-13 rating. The result is an evasive baffling unexciting production--anything but a classic. Is bullying on the rise? The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children claims that a hundred and sixty thousand kids stay home from school each day out of fear but hard numbers that would identify a trend are difficult to come by. The National Center for Education Statistics has documented a rapid rise in recent years in the number of reported incidents of bullying but that may reflect an increase in reporting rather than in actual incidents. We cant measure the current rancor against the bullying of fifty or a hundred years ago and the causes are difficult to pinpoint. Yet many people feel that kid-on-kid malevolence has become a kind of epidemic given the prevalence of cyber-bullying and in particular the unnerving stories of teen-age suicides that have dominated the headlines in recent months. Lee Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen the filmmakers who made the moving documentary ""Bully"" dont try to answer any questions. They avoid charts and graphs talking heads and sociology. Their approach is more direct and perhaps more effective. They chose as their subjects five youths from different parts of the country. As the movie begins two of them are dead. Tyler Long of Murray County Georgia hanged himself in 2009 when he was seventeen; Ty Smalley who lived outside Oklahoma City shot himself in 2010 when he was eleven. The boys presence mostly in old home videos haunts the film. Both had been persistently bullied. We hear about what happened--physical intimidation some of it severe--from their inconsolable parents but why the boys were targeted remains a mystery. Hirsch and Lowen hoping to celebrate their subjects have rightly created a lyrical work. They film the other kids at home at school and at leisure as they wander in the woods or around railroad yards. At times the movie becomes a wistful idyll of rural American childhood under threat. Violence hangs in the air. One of the subjects is Alex Libby a twelve-year-old seventh grader at East Middle School in Sioux City Iowa. Alex was born prematurely and he has a slightly curved and flattened upper lip. Hell be considered cool-looking when hes older (an American Belmondo) but he doesnt know that yet and he has been bullied for his appearance since grade school. The filmmakers embedded themselves at East Middle School for a year and filmed many children so as to disguise their real purpose which was to see how Alex copes with his predicament. He mostly takes it in silence because he wants to maintain the fiction that his tormentors are his friends. His father tells him to stand up for himself but some kids are not fighters. Sitting in the back of a school bus the filmmakers using a Canon 5D Mark II which looks like a still camera managed to shoot a rubbery little heavyweight beating Alex. Hirsch and Lowen took the footage to Alexs parents and they went enraged to the school administrators who had also watched it. The Libbys come across as loving and alert as do the parents of the two other kids in the film--JaMeya Jackson a fourteen-year-old African-American girl in rural Mississippi and Kelby Johnson in Tuttle Oklahoma who is sixteen years old and openly gay. JaMeyas mother fights for her daughter in the criminal-justice system after JaMeya tired of being called stupid waved a loaded revolver at kids on her school bus. Kelbys father says that once his daughter came out the kids at her school turned on her and the town began shunning the entire family. Kelby it becomes clear doesnt want to pick up and go elsewhere--though she has cuts on her wrist shes jolly and combative--and her father supports her decision. The school administrators we see however cannot be described as alert. (At East Middle School the vice-principal assures the Libbys that the students on the bus are as ""good as gold."") Their attitude is one variant or another on ""Kids will be kids."" Managing huge public institutions they dont know how to change the culture they work in. ""Bully"" has powerful friends the Weinstein Company is distributing it and celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres Justin Bieber and Meryl Streep have been talking it up and appearing at screenings. But only a change in popular culture can seriously affect attitudes and at the moment that change is being impeded by an improbable enemy--the Motion Picture Association of America. The M.P.A.A.s rating board counted six ""f""-words in the film and gave it an R rating a decision that has effectively destroyed the possibility that the picture will do any good. Most public schools are not going to sponsor screenings of an R-rated film no matter how high-minded and somehow I cant see bullies demanding that their parents take them to the mall to see ""Bully."" Chris Dodd the former Connecticut senator who is now the head of the M.P.A.A. has said ""If we change the ruling in this case Ill have ten other filmmakers lined up saying they shouldnt be given the R. And who are we to say why this film should be different than the others?"" For starters the M.P.A.A. could consider the context in which profanity is used. In ""Bully"" the most virulent use of it is by a boy who threatens Alex Libby in a particularly obscene way. That child uses the word to frighten and to punish. The rest of the language is just color and punctuation like most profanity and few middle schoolers today are likely to be wounded by it. Katy Butler a seventeen-year-old high-school junior in Ann Arbor Michigan who had a finger broken by kids when she was in middle school began an online petition drive to fight the M.P.A.A.s rating which so far has more than four hundred thousand signatures. Kids may understand better than their elders what actually threatens them.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Murray Close/HONS/Lionsgate/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The film adaptation of the first of Suzanne Collinss three ""Hunger Games"" novels arrives with the most sure-shot appeal of any nonsequel since ""Twilight"" (2008). Both target the same demographic ages roughly 10 to 18; gender female; social media choice all of them.Unless the movie disappoints them - and it wont - theyll spread the good word via Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr and Pinterest or whatever it is that unbeknownst to an older demographic may have already supplanted them.""The Hunger Games"" takes place in a postapocalyptic America. All that remains of the United States is Panem a 12-district federation headed by cagey President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Capitol Panems central city is home to a wealthy decadent elite whose comforts and high-tech toys are supported by the labor of an impoverished majority. Its a social structure with echoes of ""The Time Machine"" ""Metropolis"" and John Boormans whacked-out ""Zardoz."" RecommendedIn Pictures The Hunger Games Having crushed a broad rebellion some 74 years ago the government reasserts its authority over the population by staging the annual Hunger Games a sort of gladiatorial competition-cum-reality TV show 24 teen-agers - one boy and one girl from each district - are abandoned in a wilderness from which only one will be allowed to emerge alive. In Pictures The Hunger Games Monitor Movie Guide Among this years contestants is tough resourceful Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) from the poorest region of all District 12 a coal-mining area that looks a whole lot like 1930s Appalachia. Will Katniss survive? Will she be able to avoid killing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the other District 12 entrant for whom she may be developing romantic feelings? Will the sun rise tomorrow?Its tempting - though probably foolhardy - to look for cultural/political connections to explain the emergence and immense popularity of Collinss vision. But first youd have to trace the social and political origins behind the rise of reality TV in the 90s - which is the obvious inspiration for a number of similar films including ""The Truman Show"" (1998) ""Series 7"" (2001) and ""The Condemned"" (2007). What sets Collinss books apart from these is the idea of the warriors being average teenagers; but even that twist has already been used in director Kinji Fukasakus great ""Battle Royale"" (2000) to which ""Hunger Games"" has many similarities.The real mystery is how the greatgranddaddy (and possibly best) of the genre - Elio Petris 1965 ""The 10th Victim"" starring Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress - somehow managed to predict and satirize reality TV as we know it 25 or 30 years before it existed.Director Gary Ross (""Pleasantville"" ""Seabiscuit"") and screenwriter Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"") - who share the screenplay credit with Collins - have wisely cleaved very closely to the tightly written novel. (One or two bits of exposition may be briefly confusing to those who havent read the book.) Ross manages to keep the pacing remarkably swift given that the games themselves dont start until halfway through the 144-minute running time.Ross also got the casting dead right Woody Harrelson as the alcoholic former champion who coaches Katniss and Peeta; Stanley Tucci as the broadcasts preening host; and Lenny Kravitz as the only city dweller Katniss might be able to trust. Casting Lawrence in the lead was a no-brainer given the roles similarities to her character in ""Winters Bone"" which earned her an Oscar nomination.

Those unfamiliar with the title should find Games a solid piece of action.Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) hews as closely to the novel as he can in a 21/2-hour movie. Games hurries us to Panem the fractured nation that rose in the ashes of an unspecified cataclysm.STORY Super-hyped Hunger Games storms into theatersVIDEO 5 Questions with Josh Hutcherson and Liam HemsworthMORE Premiere draws thousands of starved fansLike a lot of Hollywood futures this one is dystopian though with a capital DYS To keep Panems 12 impoverished districts in order the government holds annual Hunger Games in which a boy and girl from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death on prime-time TV.Games shines brightest in its choice for 16-year-old heroine Katniss Everdeen played with a beautiful steeliness by Jennifer Lawrence an Oscar nominee for 2010s Winters Bone.About the movieThe Hunger Games out of fourStarsJennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Woody Harrelson Liam Hemsworth Elizabeth Banks Stanley TucciDirectorGary RossDistributor Lionsgate Rating PG-13 for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images all involving teens Running time 2 hours 22 minutes Opens today nationwideWhether she picked it up shooting Bone or has it inherently Lawrence possesses a striking blend of survivalist toughness and juvenile vulnerability. Lawrence convinces as a teen clumsy at love but adept with a bow and arrow.She uses weapons aplenty here. Although the film excises the sexuality of Collins book it doesnt shy from showing kids beating each other to death with bricks. Nothing is too graphic as filmmakers skirted as closely as they could to an R rating. But parents may want to heed the 13-year-old cutoff.Games does a compelling job portraying the oppressed too. The Capitol home of the wildly wigged privileged classes plays in jarring contrast to district life which makes the Great Depression look like salad days.Twilight this isnt While both franchises feature a love triangle and lethal kids Games relies more on bloodlust than sexual lust. And for the most part it works. Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci get to chew scenery as unctuous officials happy to see casualties mount. Woody Harrelson plays an appealing Haymitch Abernathy the hard-drinking mentor who once hacked his way to victory and has Katniss back.The films failings arent entirely its own making. In trying to match the novels myriad cast Games paints a raft of characters it cant support leaving deaths that should be heartrending more as a pause in the action. And while Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are emotionally layered in the novel here they are simpler souls two-thirds of a rickety love triangle.None of this will matter of course to Hunger-lings particularly those with reasonable expectations. The action is brisk the acting is solid and barring an unlikely failure at the box office a franchise is born. Let the games begin.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Hunger Games Science fiction. Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth. Directed by Gary Ross. (PG-13. 142 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Teens killing each other off Why thats a splendid premise for a PG-13 movie isnt it? Just as it was a splendid premise for a trilogy of young adult novels. Yes I am making light of ""The Hunger Games"" in which children of a future realm are plucked from a lottery and forced to fight to the death in a domed outdoor arena. Suzanne Collins YA series sold approximately 8 bazillion copies and the movie version is likely to sell double that number of tickets. So why is the market for ritualized dystopian child murder so obvious and large? Three theories spring to mind after watching Gary Ross solid if unexceptional adaptation. One As a race human beings never really got past the need to sacrifice their children to the gods of (fill in blank). Two The parallels with modern society our fear of a dictatorial government and the ever-expanding rift between the haves and the have-nots are striking a chord in the age of Occupy Wall Street. Or three ""Twilight""-style love triangles featuring one girl and two boys are hot. This is better than any of the ""Twilights."" It features a functioning creative imagination and lots of honest-to-goodness acting by its star Jennifer Lawrence who brings her usual toughness and emotional transparency to the archer-heroine Katniss. As Peeta her fellow combatant from the dreary District 12 Josh Hutcherson suffers through bland self-sacrifice (but at least he gets more screen time than Liam Hemsworth as Gale the third wheel). Supporting players do their bit with flair Woody Harrelson as the soused mentor Haymitch and Stanley Tucci as the spangly blue emcee Caesar Flickerman.

On the other hand they might not appreciate its nauseating reliance on wobbly-cam close-ups a plague upon action movies. But perhaps muddiness is Ross intent; perhaps its a way to make the child-on-child violence less graphic and as a result less disturbing. All those bloody deaths by brick and scythe and knife and spear and arrow are finessed with quick edits and strategic camera jiggles reducing the impact. The film like the book never settles down in tone or intent. The cold Orwellian architecture and cruel Swiftian message (kids slaying kids is a more-than-modest proposal) would indicate satire while the nutty fluorescent hairdos suggest its all goof - a chance to play dress-up with the bold aesthetic cues of sci-fi fascism. As for the romance at the center well teens will be teens. At least when they arent busy killing each other.

Why arent they devastated? If the filmmakers had done their job with any courage the audience would have been both juiced and devastated. Like millions of others from preteens to fogeys I found the first of Suzanne Collinss The Hunger Games novels smashingly well-written and deeply upsetting I was shaking when I put it down haunted both by the carnage and my own complicity in rooting for the deaths of the children trying to kill the heroine Katniss Everdeen. The book and its two sequels are set in an unspecified future in which a country -- presumably the former United States -- is divided into twelve fenced-off districts many miles apart. Each year to remind people of its limitless power a totalitarian government holds a lottery to select two children per district to participate in a killing ritual televised to the masses complete with pregame ceremonies and beauty-pageant-style interviews. Out of 24 children only one will live. And we pray it will be Katniss who volunteers for the games -- unprecedentedly -- in place of her little sister the lottery ""winner."" Both the novel and its obvious inspiration the shocking Japanese film Battle Royale are cruel as well as kicky When a child dies we breathe a sigh of relief that the good guys have one less adversary but we rarely go ""Yes"" We feel revulsion for this evil ritual and the system that holds it in place for the government that believes the surest way to guarantee obedience is the sacrifice of children. But if the movies director Gary Ross has qualms about kids killing kids he doesnt share them with the audience. The murders onscreen are quick and apart from a mean girl stung to death by wasps clean. The cutting is so fast that you can hardly see whats happening which has already won Ross praise for his restraint his tastefulness. Tasteful child-killing In spite of the body count the rating is PG-13. Think about it If Ross had made the murders agonizing and tragic -- truly horrifying -- hed likely have gotten an R. But by taking the sting out of death he has a made a slaughterfest for the whole family. With the exception of one egregiously adorable character no one is even mourned or missed. Rosss penchant is for showbiz satire a pleasant enough approach in Pleasantville but ruinous in Seabiscuit in which a great book about the torturous underbelly of horse racing became a lame movie-ish period piece. His approach to The Hunger Games is hackish and dimwitted. From the first scene on the film is all shaky close-ups so you rarely have a chance to take in the space and the editing is so fast (three angles when one will do) that you can barely focus. (There were times I wished Katniss would turn her arrow on the camera operator.) As Katnisss dissolute mentor Haymitch a former Hunger Games champ Woody Harrelson has no chance to establish a comic rhythm -- or more important disgust at the system hes now a party to. The books most fascinating mercurial character the costume designer Cinna is now a blandly nice guy played by the agreeable but dull non-actor Lenny Kravitz. Watching The Hunger Games I was struck both by how slickly Ross hit his marks and how many opportunities he was missing to take the film to the next level -- to make it more shocking lyrical crazy daring. A highlight of the book is how Cinna uses his showbiz savvy to make the reluctant Katniss -- who cant conceal her loathing of the decadence and inhumanity of the conspicuously consumptive District 1 -- a star the center of the pre-Hunger Games pageant. But in the movie her entrance in a costume thats literally in flames is so poorly framed you cant savor her triumph. Ross throws away what could be a startling image of child warriors rising out of tubes to face one another in a semicircle each knowing that he or she might have seconds to live. The novels most unnerving detail that a pack of man-eating synthetic mutts have the eyes of murdered children is inexplicably left out Now theyre just generic beasts. The Hunger Games has two great assets the score by James Newton Howard which manages to be at once thrilling and plaintive and the Katniss of Jennifer Lawrence. The actress is not a conventionally chiseled Hollywood ingenue or a trained action star. But theres a steadiness in her blue eyes that makes her riveting. She brings the same grim self-containment to Katniss that she had as Ree Dolly in Winters Bone -- and she looks mighty good with a bow and arrow. Without words Lawrence makes it clear that Katnisss task is not merely to stay alive but to hold on to her humanity at all costs. A few other actors register in spite of the speed-freak editing. Josh Hutcherson has a strong sorrowful countenance as Katnisss fellow District 12 contestant Peeta and there are fun performances by Stanley Tucci in a blue bouffant as a talk-show host; Wes Bentley in a manicured black-fungus beard as the Games high-tech coordinator; and Donald Sutherland in a white mane as the demonic lion of a president. I liked the cutting back and forth between Katniss and the Hunger Games control room where contestants are monitored and special effects -- fireballs rampaging dog monsters -- are devised and dispatched. (The book is told from Katnisss perspective so were not privy to the governments machinations.) Shots of Katniss running through the woods the canopy of trees above her streaking by evoke her heightened fight-or-flight instincts -- one of the few instances in which Rosss visual strategy suits the characters emotions. Back to the audience satisfied buzzing. The Hunger Games is likely to break box-office records and I have no doubt the majority of its audience will like it and love (for good reason) Jennifer Lawrence. But where is the pervasive lingering sense of loss? Where is the horror? Maybe the true horror is how easily the movie goes down.

Well as you may be gathering from reports of the millions of tickets sold before prints were even shipped to theaters author Suzanne Collins has a feast for you in the first movie installment of her young-adult trilogy The Hunger Games. In the novels she imagined a society called Panem built on the ruins of a war-torn climate-ravaged North America and its been efficiently brought to screen life -- a totalitarian society where the wars victors live in a shining city on a hill and keep the losers -- the 99 percent? -- in the direst poverty living in 12 variously starving and miserable districts. The 1-percenters cant help rubbing their dominance in and Collins central notion -- reportedly inspired by channel-surfing between reality shows and news reports of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- is that to be sure the losers never forget how completely theyve been subjugated the Capitol stages a televised ritual each year kids fighting kids to the death. Its called the Hunger Games and it requires each district to provide two ""tributes"" between the ages of 12 and 18 a boy and a girl selected by lottery to battle in a huge arena where cameras capture their every feint thrust and death throe. Its the ultimate TV game show required viewing for the subjugated masses -- an effective way for a totalitarian few to say ""If we can kill your kids for sport what else might we do?"" -- and cheery entertainment for the privileged few in the Capitol. First place gets the winner a life free from starvation. Second place ... well there is no second place. But as everyone keeps saying ""May the odds be ever in your favor."" The tributes we follow hail from District 12 which looks a lot like Dorothea Langes photos of Depression-era Appalachia. The names pulled from a fishbowl at the ""reaping"" are those of a bakers son (Peeta Melark played by a bland but serviceable Josh Hutcherson) and a coal miners daughter named Primrose (Willow Shields) whos so afraid of her own shadow that she wouldnt last two minutes in the arena. Knowing that her older sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. Volunteers that is to be slaughtered on television in front of all of Panem -- a great TV moment wouldnt you say? And one thats captured on lots of on-screen screens so you wont miss that point. In the novel its easy to forget about the TV cameras because 16-year-old Katniss is the narrator and when she plunges into the arena you plunge in with her -- a level of engagement most filmmakers would (pardon the expression) kill for. Related NPR Stories Monkey See Spiders And Fighting And Trees Oh My Filming The Hunger Games Monkey See The Games We Play -- In Panem And Here Books Edgy Violent Thrillers For The Teen-Age Set Director Gary Ross (who shares screenplay credit with Collins and Billy Ray) wants a different sort of audience buy-in. He keeps cutting to blue-haired TV host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci unctuous and clearly enjoying himself) to emphasize what you might call a celebrity-TV-on-steroids creepiness. This is after all kids killing kids as entertainment -- American Idol with knives -- and once the games begin we in the movie audience will be as guilty of being entertained as the folks in the Capitol To root for Peeta and Katniss after all is to root for other kids to be slaughtered (albeit in violence so sliced and diced in the editing room that its earned a PG-13 rating). The films biggest asset is Lawrence who makes Katniss just as tough and smart as the last coal miners daughter she played -- in Winters Bone where she took home an Oscar nomination for doing many of the same things she does here. (Shooting small game in the rural wilds for instance to provide for younger siblings and an ineffectual mother.) If youre older than the films target audience that wont be the only outside reference thatll occur to you as you watch the film. Theres the dressing-up-to-be-selected-to-die scene from the short story The Lottery; the Wizard of Oz by way of Dr. Seuss hairstyles and fashions of the Capitol; the plot that mirrors the Japanese teen flick Battle Royale and a generous helping of fall-of-Rome references from the tributes introductory chariot ride through the streets of the Capitol to such sibilant character names as Cinna Seneca and Caesar to the name of the country itself Panem which sounds like a shortening of Pan American but is actually from the Latin ""panem et circenses"" for ""bread and circuses."" The cribbing from real-world and literary sources is so wide-ranging in fact that when Katniss is being coached for her first TV interview by a tipsy Woody Harrelson (largely wasted as District 12 mentor Haymitch) and a pansexually seductive Lenny Kravitz (making a substantial impression with very few lines but some fetching gold eyeshadow) it might occur to you that theres a Pygmalion thing going on with her makeover. Not because anyones humming ""The Rain in Spain"" while shes being dressed to kill but because The Hunger Games -- like the Potter and Twilight franchises -- is such a relentless aggregator of pop-culture references that you figure the connection mustve occurred to someone. Though the filmmakers have made some modestly interesting casting choices -- both tributes from District 11 for instance are what I suppose youd have to call African-Panemian something Collins doesnt hint at in the novel -- the movie doesnt actually have a lot to say about the social issues it brings up. And its literalness did make me question things I hadnt while reading the book -- say that a society with hovercraft and digitally created carnivores is still this dependent on coal? Still The Hunger Games pacing is brisk its stakes as high as stakes get and its leading lady engaging enough that the odds -- at the box office at least -- will be ever in its favor.

But fans of the trilogy will be happy to know that the unlikeliest of action directors Gary Ross (Pleasantville Seabiscuit) has taken this strange propulsive post-apocalyptic fantasy treated it faithfully and in the few instances where hes added his own twist actually made the story richer. Case in point as Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) begins to become a Joan of Arc-type heroine fighting for her life in the woods in front of a TV audience of millions the threat to order she poses is not lost on President Snow (Donald Sutherland) the sinister chief executive of the oppressive nation of Panem formerly the U.S. A relatively minor figure in the books he is given a soliloquy written by Ross and delivered to Snows second-in-command Seneca (Wes Bentley) about the importance of hope in controlling a population and the even greater importance of keeping hope in check. It is a moving piece of writing and it takes author Suzanne Collins metaphor-laden adventure to a new layer of sophistication and relevance (Arab Spring anyone?). For those who havent had the plot hammered into them by the studio marketing campaign The Hunger Games takes place in an American dystopia where the rich decadent Capitol rules brutally over 12 ""districts"" that make up Panem. The Hunger Games are a ritual of control wherein each district chooses a boy and girl aged 12-18 to take part in a mass fight to the death. Katniss - an Appalachian girl with mad bow-and-arrow skills - steps in to replace her fragile kid sister and is joined by the local baker Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) whose chief asset is charm. Theyre joined en route to the Capitol by a couple of dubious mentors including etiquette advisor Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) wardrobe advisor Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and the only living games champion from Katnisss district the drunk and cynical Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). The set-up is an hour long and it leaves us plenty of time to imagine what it all means (Ross is professional enough not to hit us over the head with metaphors). At times the whole thing seems to have a Red State/Blue State vibe with the rainbow-haired drag-queen chic of Capitol citizens almost being a spoof of what people in Middle America would imagine New Yorkers to look like. The monumental architecture meanwhile evokes Rome/Nazi-era Berlin. The Hunger Games though ramps up the tension when the killing gets started. The steamy North Carolina woods is almost a character in and of itself. Its also where Lawrence who was quietly strong in the Oscar-nominated Winters Bone becomes a physically dominant figure. The last act of the movie is riveting without being graphically violent. In the end the movie is undeniably a rich fantasy adventure with plenty of narrative wiggle-room for the two books/movies to follow. Hunger Games Premiere 2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.

The idea that you could get a PG-13 movie into theaters thats based even a little bit on children being rounded up by the state and forced to murder each other for the amusement of a mass audience is on the face of it a wacky business. Youd have been laughed out of Hollywood with this a few decades back even with Battle Royale as precedent even with equally subversive films (V for Vendetta Fight Club Trainspotting) having made their way to theaters before collapsing under the weight of their apparent cultural disconnect. Based upon only The Hunger Games being adapted youd have to look around measure current cultural temperatures and think ""Well something has changed."" But what? And to what level is this simply a teen love triangle with Running Man playing in the background? These are tough questions. Well attempt to answer them. The Hunger Games starts in Mississippi. No not really as North America has ceased to exist and along with it Mississippi but the film certainly starts in a poor rural community (noted as Appalachia in the book) called ""District 12"" where the pride and struggle of the populace is apparent on their weather-worn faces. These are hard scrabble folk and they look after their own but they lack for infrastructure. The people of District 12 dont live they just survive. The ""Capitol"" of Panem lords over twelve districts and once per year comes ""The Reaping"" where they round up two ""tributes"" from each district a boy and a girl to play in the Capitols ""Hunger Games"" to remind everyone who is boss and on behalf of commerce and excellent (mandatory) television ratings. These ""Hunger Games"" pit district against district tribute against tribute in a fight to the death. Pomp and circumstance surround the games juxtaposed against yoke of oppression put upon the poor downtrodden outer districts and when the emissary from The Capitol Effie (Elizabeth Banks) tries to get the crowd fired up for two of their owns demise they greet her with the hardened stares of people who have always gotten the short end of the stick. They are not amused. The people of District 12 are hungry impoverished and kept in line only by Panems ""peacekeepers"".  They produce coal for Panem but they never see the wealth. Its a recipe for civil unrest massive injustice presented to a people who never had a say on any of the rules in the first place. Enter Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Shes a District 12-er she provides for her Mom and Sister with her (illegal) hunting. She shows up at The Reaping with a decent shot at being chosen for ""The Hunger Games"" but with a couple thousand other eligible young adults also in the pool shes hoping she wont be picked and shes not. However her sister is and she instinctively volunteers to take her place. These are heart wrenching scenes a big sister protecting her little sis things being unfair simply because thats the way they are. Her co-tribute is the bakers son Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). They are whisked off to the capitol with their mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) by their side somewhat drunk ready to send another couple of young adults to their deaths for no reason excepting the sheer spectacle of it all. It is during ""The Hunger Games"" that things get truly interesting. Little humans take it on the chin even if its handled in cutaway fashion. Is everyone in Panem a bad person to allow this ""sacrifice"" year after year? No not exactly. Katniss stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is a particularly empathetic and talented human. But where can the line between entertainment and inhumanity be drawn? Yes The Hunger Games is an extreme version of the society we currently live in but its not so disparate as to not send a cold chill down your spine. Still the concepts get lost and muddied especially given the narrative clarity of the source material. Is this a story about Peeta and Katniss falling in love to survive? Or is it about President Snow and the effect of a government that rules through fear and intimidation? What precisely is all this adding up to? Should it be lauded for correctly noting the rise of the woman or judged as the outcry of the 99 percent? Perhaps its about African genocide or the Iraq War infomercials or maybe nothing at all. So many caveats have been made to make this commercially palatable that the underlying tone of the book is probably lost even as the whisper of its drumbeat is picked up in certain moments. That along with the knowledge that things get REAL real in the sequels makes many of the choices understandable ... if not completely exemplary. Where higher marks must be given is with a few of the actors. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Caesar Flickerman the lead announcer and MC of ""The Hunger Games"" hes both helpful to the tributes chances (making them seem sympathetic in their murderous quest) while still standing as a symbol of everything thats wrong with Panem. Its a difficult balancing act but Tucci delivers. Lenny Kravitz is also understated and effective as Cinna Katniss stylist a man who clearly understands more about the politics of the day than is safe to divulge. Jennifer Lawrence works as Katniss though the case could be made that her character is largely a blank slate for the audience to place their own emotions and values upon. Kudos also must be handed out to Elizabeth Banks as the extremely annoying Effie Trinket who regularly commands the screen. As for the other ""tributes"" they are almost unnoticeable with the exception Rue (Amandla Stenberg) Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and Thresh (Dayo Okeniyi). All three have extremely limited screen time but do their level best given the inherent restrictions. In terms of a broader critique the script isnt all there a few of the transitions are awkward and the movie does become bogged down by a lack of a central theme - but its also massively ambitious well paced and extremely innovative. As such judgment must be passed in favor of The Hunger Games and the sequels will be highly anticipated. Still the most disquieting aspect of this whole enterprise can be found in those bleak moments where the strong are effectively dominating the weak. ""The Hunger Games"" are being broadcast all around the country with friends and relatives watching their loved ones perish in real time tribute against tribute with life on the line. Director Gary Ross has made these moments brutally effective continually chiding us for wanting the games to start again. Its the damnedest thing but human suffering and subjugation plays miraculously well as entertainment so long as you mix it all up with glossy production values and multiple camera angles.

Video courtesy of Lionsgate. By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 22 2012 427 p.m. ET In life its usually feast or famine. In ""The Hunger Games"" its both a feast of cheesy spectacle and a famine of genuine feeling except for the powerful--and touchingly vulnerable--presence of Jennifer Lawrence as the 16-year-old heroine Katniss Everdeen. Thats a significant exception but not a decisive one since theres only so much this remarkable young star can do in the benumbing big-budget surroundings. The first book of Suzanne Collinss prodigiously popular trilogy has been brought to the screen with a Jumbotron sensibility a shaky camera to emphasize the action and a shakier grip on the subjects emotional core. The action of course involves kids killing kids. In a dystopian future that bears some resemblance to the here and now--a public besotted by celebrity and drowning in entertainment--a repressive government stages nationally televised games in which 24 teenagers a boy and a girl from each of 12 districts are designated Tributes and must fight one another in the wilds of a computer-controlled artificial environment until theres only one survivor. ENLARGE Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Lionsgate The concept is hardly an original one. Older audiences with a sense of movie history will recognize more than trace elements of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" ""Spartacus"" ""Battle Royale"" or ""The Running Man."" But ""The Hunger Games"" wasnt intended for older audiences. The trilogy was written for adolescents absorbed with their own turbulent history. The unsecret ingredient of its rampant success was turning a dog-eared dog-eat-dog premise into a coming-of-age story about a strong resourceful girl then widening it into a fable of star-crossed lovers. Young readers--girls in particular though not only girls--saw themselves in Katnisss struggles to discover herself; to accept her own beauty and physicality without exploiting it; and above all to survive the savagery while keeping her humanity intact. Young audiences are sure to embrace Katniss on screen--the movie is off to an epic start--and all the more so because Ms. Lawrence is the perfect choice for the role. The first time I saw her in a feature film as the fiercely indomitable Ree Dolly in ""Winters Bone"" I would have bet that the filmmakers had found her in the Ozarks where the story was set and simply asked her to play a version of herself; such was the beauty and flawless simplicity of her performance. She was in fact already a professional actress and shes doing it again in ""The Hunger Games""--not playing a version of herself though that could also be so but playing another version of the same character with the same sort of calm and grace. Like Ree Katniss comes from hardscrabble surroundings; hunts wild animals for food though with a bow and arrow not a gun; and copes with her unconcealed fears by pushing through them. (Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta a boy from her hometown who drafted as a co-Tribute has become one of her adversaries and sees himself doomed as one of her possible victims.) But ""The Hunger Games"" which was directed by Gary Ross--the script is credited to him Ms. Collins and Billy Ray--takes a painfully long time to move Katniss and Peeta out of their town to the garish sophistication of The Capitol. Once it does her life is transformed into that of a killer-in-training with star potential and the movie is transformed into a frantic mash-up of surreal game show lethal reality show fevered Roman spectacle and starting around the second hour--the full running time is 142 minutes--a string of action sequences staged at a relentless pace with that maddeningly twitchy camera and a singular lack of imagination. (Because the rating is PG-13 the killing scenes are not as graphic as they might have been but theyre harrowing enough thank you very much.) A few affecting moments stand out. In one of them a televised conversation between Katniss and Stanley Tuccis madcap blue-pompadoured interviewer Caesar Flickerman we see the power of her beauty and honesty and at the same time the ease with which she might be corrupted in the pursuit of celebrity. In another Katniss shares a quiet interlude of compassion and sisterhood with Rue a younger Tribute played by Amandla Stenberg. (The cast includes Elizabeth Banks as the heroines grotesquely costumed escort Effie Trinket; Lenny Kravitz as her personal stylist and confidant Cinna; Woody Harrelson as her--and Peetas--bibulous mentor Haymitch; and Donald Sutherland as the suavely brutal President Snow who has a wonderfully pithy response to someone who says he likes underdogs ""I dont"" Snow replies.) On the whole though this sprawling sometimes sluggish movie is most notable for its heavy touch--the sudden change of game rules is handled even more ineptly than in the book while the ending is downright amateurish--and for its emotional remoteness. Apart from Peeta and Rue the other Tributes remain shadowy ciphers. Cool tones dominate Tom Sterns cinematography. The books territory is covered dutifully with no evidence of a distinctive style but never explored in ways that might have given the audience access to the workings of Katnisss mind or the stirrings of her soul. I hadnt read the book before seeing the movie so I wasnt prejudiced against the adaptation. Reading it afterward though I was struck by the intelligence eloquence and subtlety of the first-person narrative qualities that the screen version in its mania for hurtling action manages to bland out. All hasnt been lost; hurtling action is a pivotal part of the mix. But this movie about kids being manipulated--literally unto death--manipulates its audience clumsily and shortchanges it shamelessly. Theres a paradox for the books. ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" is a documentary about 85-year-old sushi master Jiro Ono whose small sushi bar is located in a Tokyo subway station. Watch a clip from the film. Video Magnolia Pictures. Jiro Dreams of Sushi At the age of 85 the subject of this fascinating documentary not only dreams of sushi but still drives himself to make it better. Jiro Ono has had some practice. A sushi master at the pinnacle of his profession he presides sometimes glaringly over Sukiyabashi Jiro a 10-seat restaurant in a Tokyo subway station thats become a gastronomic shrine since it earned a three-star rating in the Michelin Guide. As sushi scarfers might guess David Gelbs film is a study in perfectionism monomania or both. Making better sushi is all he has ever wanted to do Jiro says. To that end he has been merciless on himself and only slightly less so on his two sons Yoshikazu the elder who at the age of 50 works at Jiros restaurant--he wont take over until his father retires or otherwise absents himself from the fishy scene--and Takashi the younger who opened his own restaurant with his fathers blessing. (With his hedged blessing Failure was not an option Jiro warned him.) Refreshingly Jiro has no secrets to reveal or none that hes willing to reveal. His success he insists is that of a shokunin a craftsman who does the same thing over and over; nothing has changed in the last 40 years except that he stopped smoking. But repetitive sushi syndrome is only part of the story. The open secret that governs Jiros working life--i.e. his whole life since he interrupts his work only to sleep--is his dedication to an abstract notion ""Each ingredient has an ideal moment of deliciousness."" ENLARGE Jiro Ono and his son Yoshikazu in Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Magnolia Pictures Its what guides his choice of fish and rice vendors colleagues in monomania; what prompts him to insist on his apprentices massaging an octopus for 40 to 50 minutes so that its flesh will be tender; what leads him to favor leaner cuts of tuna rather than fatty toro for their more complex taste; and what allows him to charge astronomical prices for diners whove booked seats as much as one year in advance. One of the films best moments of deliciousness comes with the revelation that Yoshikazu rather than his father made the sushi that won the Michelin inspectors over; so much for working humbly in the old mans shadow. And one of its surprises comes when Jiro speaks with admiration bordering on reverence for the French chef Joel Robuchon ""If I had his tongue and nose..."" he says wistfully. If he did then what? Would his sushi taste like sushi at all? DVD Focus ENLARGE Pleasantville (1998) In Gary Rosss debut feature teenage fraternal twins played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are magically transported from present-day suburbia to a picture-perfect town in the black-and-white world of 1950s television. Spiffy Studebakers and Packards stand on driveways next to spotless split-levels. Fathers always know best and every player sinks every shot during high-school basketball practice. For a while I thought Mr. Ross would sink every shot too; instead he sinks his premise by turning it into a leaden political parable. Until then though ""Pleasantville"" sparkles with poetic notions as color spreads throughout the town. The Truman Show (1998) Like the battling kids in ""The Hunger Games"" Jim Carreys Truman Burbank is trapped in an artificial environment but he doesnt know it even though his whole existence is being played out on a vast television set which he mistakes for the real world. ""The Truman Show"" directed by Peter Weir from a script by Andrew Niccol has been oversold as a master metaphor for our media-mad age. Its essential strengths are more dramatic and emotional than topical or satirical. Truman is a touchingly gallant creation the hero of someone elses existential burlesque. Big Night (1996) Gastronomic perfectionism is the subject--and fateful curse--of this small stirring drama that Stanley Tucci co-directed with Campbell Scott. Tony Shalhoub and Mr. Tucci are brothers Primo and Secondo who run a failing Italian restaurant in New Jersey in the 1950s. Primo is an artist a master chef but hes also a tortured purist. Secondo would sell his soul for the success of Pascals a pasta palace across the street where happy feeders pay top dollar for carbo-swill. The superb cast includes Ian Holm Isabella Rossellini and Minnie Driver. Mr. Scott plays a flaky Cadillac salesman.

I just finished the books now and I rather liked them. I dont think theyre the best books out there nor do I think its as good as Battle Royale but they were an entertaining read. There was always something for me to like through all three. But looking at the film trailer now ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I cant say it looks quite as interesting now. Im not quite sure what it is but I cant help but think that something has been lost from the translation from book to film. Morgansaid on Friday April 06 2012 63845 PMI was so excited by just the trailer that I went out and bought the books. After reading them I was even more eager to see the film adaptation to be honest at first I was reserved to see how the director would pull off such a fantastic book. And to my great surprise I was not dissapointed. I love the accuracy of the film and the development of the plot. The actors portrayed the characters wonderfully and the graphics used were superb. Hats off to Ross for a fantastic film really anticipating the next installments. Dan Skip Allensaid on Tuesday April 03 2012 124947 AMThis is my review of The Hunger Games From the Fourth Row Lynn Stephen said on Monday April 02 2012 125403 PMMe and my husband thought it was going to be great and we were very disappointed it was so slow we nearly fell asleep not at all what was advertised they made it seem like there was action from the get go and nada waste if money Dan Peterssaid on Sunday April 01 2012 115316 PMHungerFAIL Wow. This was annoyingly poor - I say annoyingly because I really Wanted to like it. I dont mind that the premise is unoriginal - weve seen elements of this before with Logans Run The Running Man The Most Dangerous Game and more recently (and blatantly) Battle Royale...so this Should work effortlessly (like zombie movies done to death but that doesnt mean good ones still cant be made)...But what Horrible execution here - I dont know where the 100million was spent I didnt see it on the screen - this looks like it should have cost half that. By the time the characters are finally dumped into the games arena we have no sense of any boundaries or scale of this place nor of any of the rules or logistical constraints (other than random fire-walls and cloned(?) attack dogs inserted at will by the controllers)...Im sure the book is less unclear - but a movie should stand on its own legs a bit more than this......................?and I might have even given these discrepancies a pass if the movie was at least interesting to look at - but I was baffled at how ineptly it was Shot. Literally 90% of the shots are closeups - I wanted to scream at the director/?cinematographer to ZOOM OUT ....Holy Fuck I cant remember when Ive felt this claustrophobic at a movie - my kingdom for a fucking wideshot ......And all of this tightness just made the sets even more underwhelming - even the woods were uninteresting and poorly scouted - not visually exciting one bit (and this is the bulk of the story were talking about here)........No sense of Time either (how long were they there anyway?) no sense of Fear or Desperation in the characters - nor did I even sense any HUNGER which supposedly was a big element there Im told............................and the actors/characters? Elizabeth Banks looks like shes in the wrong movie (she belongs in Potter next to Rita Skeeter and Delores Umbridge); Harrelson delivers his usual comic relief persona; Wes Bentley is vacant and unconvincing; Sutherland is good but underused; Tucci drifts into caricature too easily; Josh Hutchinson has zero charisma..... Whats good? Jennifer Lawrence earns her money and does what she can despite some cringe-worthy scenes shes forced to perform through - its never a good sign when Im rolling my eyes or snickering at dramatic moments whilst people beside me are wiping away tears (really? weve known this character all of 12 minutes and youre crying at her death?).....some interesting colorful art direction in the early city scenes as well (during the rare moments when the camera pulled back and let us actually See where the characters were) otherwise not much positive going on with this....Big dissapointment I was kind of excited going in. Billysaid on Sunday April 01 2012 125417 AMJust checked this title out. Was not as impressed as Mr. Roeper but would not totally disagree with his review. A bit of a snoozer but at the same time was well executed. I did not read the books but have a feeling they would be a cut above what the movie offered. One last comment I wouldnt have a problem proclaiming The Hunger Games as over-hyped. Yolanda Leonardstonsaid on Thursday March 29 2012 55610 PMI am so glad that its getting good reviews It deserves all of them; the books and movie were so marvelous David Jordaosaid on Sunday March 25 2012 83921 AMJust watched this movie yesterday. Never read any of the books but I enjoyed it. Defiantly agree with this review. Tom Carleysaid on Saturday March 24 2012 112536 PMI wish people would quit saying these books are for teenagers. I read The Hunger Games 4 years ago and I am a 35 year old man. The themes in the books are dark and tragic a lot like Shakespeare. You have games set up by an adult government as a way to punish the adults by making them watch their own children kill each other. It doesnt get much darker than that..so quit making it so simplistic and driving the adult audience away from watching something they need to see. Kevin Klawittersaid on Friday March 23 2012 122544 PMI havent read the books but I found the movie to be damn good but not quite as good as it could have been.

"The Hunger Games starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dana Stevens The Hunger Games Will Satisfy Fans of the Trilogy and Make Some New Ones Dana Stevens The Hunger Games Will Satisfy Fans of the Trilogy and Make Some New Ones Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 22 2012 1129 AM The Hunger Games Just go see it. By Dana Stevens Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) and Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in The Hunger Games Murray Close/Lions Gate Entertainment. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on The Hunger Games after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins monster young-adult bestseller about a futuristic dystopia in which teenagers battle to the death in televised gladiatorial matches is a one-sitting read the kind of flawlessly executed genre novel that makes all your other plans for the day suddenly recede into insignificance. Unlike the swoony rambling prose of some other bestselling YA novelists I could name Collins writing is vividly cinematic with evocative sensory descriptions and tight cliffhanger pacing. The bidding war for the film rights to The Hunger Games (and the two other books in Collins sci-fi trilogy Catching Fire and Mockingjay) must have rivaled the Games of the book for sheer winner-take-all bloodlust. Whether The Hunger Games movie (Lionsgate Films) was any good or not it would have had an eager fan base pounding at the theater door--not least because with the Harry Potter series just over and the Twilight one winding down tweens worldwide are in need of a new collective fantasy to obsess over. (Lest that sound snide let me note that providing collective fantasies to obsess over strikes me as one legitimate and important function of popular cinema especially for young people.) If youve been trying to ignore all the Hunger Games hype in the hopes the whole phenomenon would just fade quietly away I have some advice for you Give in. Read the book and watch the movie in that order because theyre going to be part of the conversation for a while and its more fun experiencing them than dismissing them. Director Gary Ross adaptation co-scripted by Collins herself isnt quite as crackingly paced as the novel but it will more than satisfy existing fans of the trilogy and likely create many new ones. Advertisement The key to making this adaptation work was the casting of Katniss Everdeen the 16-year-old Games participant and wild-game huntress who narrates the novel and appears in virtually every scene of both book and movie. Katniss is an unusual heroine for a story of this type stolid wary a little dour and resolutely un-boy-crazy. The role demands a young lady of substance someone whos beautiful without being girly-girl pretty and athletic without being gym-bunny buff. The films producers nailed it in picking Jennifer Lawrence whos appeared memorably in X-Men First Class and The Beaver since her career-making performance in the bleak Ozark fairy tale Winters Bone (2010.) The Hunger Games is pretty solidly cast from top to bottom but its Lawrence who carries the whole film on her sturdy shoulders. Shes a first-rate actress who with this role officially accedes to the status of movie star. I hope shes ready. One of Suzanne Collins great strengths as an author is her gift for swift economical world-building a skill that this plot summary is about to test me on Its an unspecified year in the future. What was once North America has become a totalitarian nation called Panem. The countrys seat of power is the wealthy decadent Capitol while the rest of the nation is divided into 12 districts where the citizens struggle to feed themselves. The social order in Panem is uneasily maintained through brute force constant surveillance and a barbaric sacrifice ritual known as the Reaping. Every year each of the districts chooses one boy and one girl ""tribute"" by lottery and offers the two adolescents up for participation in the nationally televised Hunger Games. After being groomed and paraded before screaming audiences in the Capitol the tributes are trained in survival skills then released into a forest where they will fight over scarce resources--water food weapons--and hunt one another until only one is left standing. Cameras are hidden throughout the gaming grounds so that the whole gruesome proceedings can be watched by a rubbernecking nation; its a Real World-style reality show via ""The Most Dangerous Game."" When her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) has her name called at the Reaping Katniss volunteers to go to the Games in her place. The male tribute from her district Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) has had a crush on her since childhood--unless as Katniss suspects thats just a ruse designed to win favor from spectators of the Games. For her part Katniss may or may not harbor unchaste feelings toward Gale (Liam Hemsworth) her hunky game-hunting companion back in District 12. Advertisement After their selection Katniss and Peeta are whisked off to the luxurious sinister Capitol where monumental Fascist architecture coexists alongside candy-colored extreme fashion. The master of ceremonies for the televised games played with grotesque verve by Stanley Tucci wears a magnificent bright-blue bouffant gathered into a bun. (The costumes makeup and production design for the Capitol are among the movies chief pleasures though I missed the books love for lingering on sumptuous banquets.) Accompanying them are Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) a former Games champion from their district whos now a bitter alcoholic and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) a blithering pink-wigged hypocrite whose job it is to remain determinedly chirpy as she shepherds these two young people to their near-inevitable slaughter. I wont give away what happens once the Games begin--all you need to know is that the PG-13-rated violence while intense is neither explicit nor sadistically lingered over. There are some hard-to-watch child deaths--it is after all a film about children fighting to the death--but the scenes they occur in are hard to watch because of their emotional and moral heft rather than because of their ""dude thats harsh"" factor (though that one kid who gets stung by genetically engineered super-wasps ... dude thats harsh.) This is a violent mass entertainment that critiques violent mass entertainments by extrapolating the logic of reality TV to a place of absurdity. The Hunger Games isnt perfect. The character of Gale an important moral voice in the book has been reduced to generic hunky dreamboat-dom (a development thats not Liam Hemsworths fault; he simply hasnt been given enough to do other than stare besotted at TV screens on which Katniss is off doing something interesting). Woody Harrelson a brilliant actor whos been hitting his career peak in recent roles seems somehow too sexy and suave for the role of Haymitch even if the character has been cleaned up from the book (where hes a perpetually low-functioning malodorous drunk.) Ross (who also co-wrote Big and directed Pleasantville and Seabiscuit) could have done more to shape The Hunger Games cliffhanger ending into something more narratively satisfying; as it is the movies last minute might as well consist of a grip holding a placard that reads ""Come back for Part 2."" But for this movies core audience therell be no need to wait for the next movie before coming back. If you have a kid between the ages of 11 and 17--boy or girl timid or bold athletic or retiring--get ready to spend a fortune on repeat viewings tie-in video games and quite possibly archery lessons.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The much-repeated motto for teen gladiators of ""The Hunger Games"" is ""May the odds be ever in your favor."" The odds of making a good film of the property were daunting. How can you balance the demands of a violent science fiction opus a story of star-crossed young love and a dark portrait of class warfare and dystopian decadence? Above all how do you cope with the ardent expectations of 23 million readers who turned Suzanne Collins books into a global pop cult phenomenon? Happily the film should meet most high hopes and exceed the rest. ""The Hunger Games"" is a furiously compelling metaphor for adolescent angst where the competition for friendship and love unfolds in an arena where kids kill each other. In a disturbing near-future this televised blood sport is a tool used by the rich totalitarians of the Capitol to control their once-rebellious states. Katniss Everdeen a bow hunter from impoverished District 12 enters the game with poor prospects but outfights and outwits her adversaries and the adults controlling the game. Each step of the way the film is deeply involving. A onetime TV writer Collins (who co-wrote the script) knows how to drive a story and design a cliffhanger. The chase and combat sequences that make up half the film are propulsively paced and jarring. That excitement is necessary but on its own its not enough to make a satisfying adventure. What elevates the film from commonplace is the way it makes its characters rich archetypes rather than perfunctory stereotypes. As Katniss the extravagantly talented Jennifer Lawrence renders her character with surgical precision. Her defiance against the Hunger Games overlords is instinctual. Her stoic composure in the face of danger doesnt come so naturally; when it slips we see the vulnerable girl clearly. Murray Close / Lionsgate Associated Press Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss Everdeen in a scene from ""The Hunger Games."" Lawrence delivers an absolutely assured performance but shes hardly the whole show. As her fellow competitor Peeta Josh Hutcherson moves persuasively along an arc that begins in conflicted feelings and deepens to friendship loyalty and love. Donald Sutherland is subtle and sinister as President Snow who explains the emotional power of the survival spectacle a drama that gives the masses a bit of hope but not enough to make them restless. Stanley Tucci makes a vile vampire-like impression as the Games on-air master of ceremonies sporting a navy blue 17th-century periwig and pearly carnivorous teeth. The films other commanding strength is director Gary Ross instinct for lush risky visual imagery that makes the film startling. His camera is often handheld jostling inside a crowd for a better view of the action. At other times it mimics the vantage point of a character keenly searching for an escape route or stunned and bleary after a near-death shock. The sound goes tinny after a concussive explosion and drops away altogether at a moment of crisis. Ross makes canny use of his production designers. Katniss grim hometown evokes Dorothea Langes photographs of Depression-era Appalachia. When shes transported to the extravagant Capitol the screen explodes with too-rich color like a noxious version of Dorothys entry into Oz. With its grandiose Albert Speer architecture and Lagerfeld-on-mushrooms fashions the hyperbolic tacky look of the place tells us all we need to know about the inhabitants. Ross creates a world of drastic extremes and he has a sure grasp of each margin. I dont think there has been a studio sci-fi film this idea-rich since ""The Matrix."" Viewers who like a side order of political allegory with their science fiction will find much to savor here. So will romantics fans of feminist heroines and action enthusiasts. ""The Hunger Games"" is that rare creation an event movie of real significance.

Photo credit Murray Close Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen in THE HUNGER GAMES. As a cinematic snack ""The Hunger Games"" is meatier and less cheesy than any of the ""Twilight"" movies.That might be lukewarm praise but this adaptation of a teen-lit bestseller about a ruthless reality show doesnt rely on lofty technique or penetrating insight to hit its target. Its a streamlined fable with enough zing to keep the franchise flying until the next round.Jennifer Lawrence propels the movie as reluctant heroine Katniss Everdeen. In a futuristic riff on ""Winters Bone"" the teen archer hunts squirrels for her widowed mother and younger sister while federal stormtroopers keep the cloistered peasants under surveillance. The feds are on guard against another uprising like the one they suppressed seven decades ago. A legacy of the civil war is that two children from each district are chosen in an annual lottery to compete in a televised death match called the Hunger Games. Only one of the 24 contestants will survive the outdoor hunt and reap the rewards.When her little sisters name is pulled from the fishbowl Katniss quickly volunteers to take her place. Under the tutelage of drunken ex-champion Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) Katniss is hardened into a killing machine beside her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). But along with hand-to-hand combat they must learn face-to-face publicity skills as the contestants collect survival rations from their sponsors.""The Hunger Games"" is dressed as a dark satire of soulless entertainment but like Katniss adversaries in the PG-13 hunting scenes it fails to develop a distinctive identity or go for the throat. The foppishly coiffed elites who cheer for blood are a cliche in such movies as are the smarmy telecast host (Stanley Tucci) and the callous control-room overlord (Wes Bentley). Adapting the novel by Suzanne Collins director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") sacrifices social perception for emotional payoff by keeping the focus of Katniss. Lawrence seizes almost every scene of this overlong movie and her charismatic mix of toughness and vulnerability leaves love interests Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth starving for attention.While a last-act regurgitation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" produces a flavorless ending Lawrence is the living promise that the next course of ""The Hunger Games"" will give us more to chew on.

Now director Gary Ross impressively weighty adaptation makes a sinewy and sharp-boned argument that the rest of us get to know these young denizens of Panems District 12. They will be around for a spell. (The film broke records in advance sales earlier this week according to Fandango the movie ticketing site.) Panem and the Capitol its shining city by water and mountains are whats left of the United States after cataclysmic years of war. The Hunger Games are the televised gladiator-like death match intended to serve as a reminder that uprisings are bad and will forever be punished. Each year ""Tributes"" -- ages 12 to 18 -- are chosen during the national lottery called the Reaping. Katniss takes the nearly unheard-of step of volunteering when her beloved little sister Prim is selected. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson make it easy to care about the coal miners daughter and the bakers son sent from hardscrabble District 12 to compete to the death against combatants from 11 other districts -- and each other -- in the annual ritual of governmental retribution. The bloody rite unfolds in a vast forested ""arena"" of hazards manipulated by the Gamemakers and their tech-savvy designers. Kids are forced to kill other kids. The state makes reality television out of the challenge. Some competitors take to the task with relish and brawn. Others hope to outlast the more violent among them. ""Survivor Capitol"" Season 74 could be the title of the challenge Katniss and Peeta face. Lenny Kravitz gives a fine turn as Cinna the stylist behind the games most fiery pair. Stanley Tucci portrays talk-show host and Hunger Games commentator Caesar Flickerman whos a hybrid of hype a mashup of Ryan Seacrest and Dick Clark. ""The Hunger Games"" offers a bracing and bitter brew of anxieties. Some are personal When does fondness tip into something other? Is the bond between Katniss and hunting partner and confidante Gale (Liam Hemsworth) left to watch back at home already more than friendship? What does it mean to be a good daughter or a protective big sister? Others are more sociopolitical. The world Katniss is born into is Orwellian. From yammering guide Effie Trinkett (Elizabeth Banks) to the nations president (Donald Sutherland) Panems higher-ups are fluent in doublespeak. ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" is a signature example of the cruel disconnect of language. Any doubts about what sort of liberties are at stake? Panems national emblem resembles the Third Reichs eagles. The novel unfolds in Katniss first-person. Nudged well and wisely from page to screen by Ross Collins and Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"" and ""Breach"") the film forgoes a voice-over yet remains intimate. This has a lot to do with a gritty yet appealing aesthetic thats more indie than tent-pole. Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern resort to a hand-held rough-and-ready camerawork that serves the story of hunters and hunting nicely but also suggests subjectivity. Editing implies the violence of combat more than shows it. ""The Hunger Games"" earns but doesnt overstep its PG-13 rating. No doubt there will be readers who find things to quibble about. For instance those fond of the books buffoonish version of Haymitch Abernathy -- District 12s only survivor and now Katniss and Peetas mentor in the Capitol -- might find Woody Harrelsons turn far less humorous. Hes still a lush but hardly loutish. Fresh to ""The Hunger Games"" this reader-viewer finds it pitch-perfect emotionally. Lawrence and Hutcherson who proved their mettle in two indie hits ""Winters Bone"" and ""The Kids Are All Right"" show that you can go big yet stay true. Ross moves between action and human drama with nimble awareness of the weight of the issues coursing through the story of fascism propaganda and yes adolescence under the weight of the world.

Slideshow Stills from The Hunger Games Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Video Trailer The Hunger Games More about The Hunger Games >> If that sounds familiar consider the little indie that Lawrence starred in two years ago Winters Bone hardly a franchise wannabe but a powerful film with four Oscar nominations (including best actress and best picture). Lawrence was Ree Dolly a strong-willed teen from a broken-down backwoods home with a depressed debilitated mother and two young siblings to care for. As an audition reel for The Hunger Games Lawrences turn in Winters Bone must have mattered immensely Ree and Katniss are parallel-universe doppelgangers. And its not just the similarity of the roles either but also the environments the young heroines inhabit. In Winters Bone Ree lives with her family on hard Ozarks land surrounded by poverty and despair. And so it is too in District 12 the bleak coal-mining country where Katniss goes hunting in the woods (with bow and arrow) for squirrel and deer lest she her mother and sister starve. Gary Ross who directs this elaborate and tonally odd adaptation of Collins novel pans the sooted faces the ragged clotheslines the muddy roads of District 12 - its like watching a gallery of Dorothea Lange photographs from the Great Depression. In fact its the postapocalypse a North America ruined by war and revolt in which 12 districts form the nation of Panem ringing a city called the Capitol. The outlying areas are populated mostly by the underclass; people work the mines and farms to feed and fuel the citizens of the city a hub of media and fashion where the men and women fuss around in makeup frocks and big poufs of colored hair. Imagine Versailles at the time of Marie Antoinette only with bullet trains and towering glass skyscrapers. So what is the Hunger Games? Its a Super Bowl-scale event in which each of the 12 districts selects two teens a boy and a girl to compete in a fight to the death. They are called tributes selected by lottery. And only one will remain when this lethal take on TVs Survivor is finished. (The games are a form of punishment and intimidation instituted 74 years earlier after an uprising almost took down the government.) And when Katniss wee sib the pigtailed Primrose (Willow Shields) is selected for District 12s team the heroine of The Hunger Games steps up to take her place. Katniss finds herself partnered with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) a bakers son who has long admired Katniss. (His crush confession provides a teen-romance moment of levity in the midst of the sci-fi/fantasy dread.) As they prepare for the games Katniss and Peeta are mentored by a tribute of yesteryear Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) - a guy drowning his survivors guilt in booze. They are also tended to by a stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz with eyeliner) assigned to make over these District 12 hicks so they look glammy and cool. Its easy to see The Hunger Games appeal both as a trilogy of books and now a film Its about kids competing against kids forming alliances and then betraying those alliances and going after one another with cutthroat intensity. In other words high school. But its high school taken to a fictive plane a realm that incorporates video games reality TV futuro-retro fashions and Truman Show-esque God-is-in-the-control-booth themes of manipulation and oppression. And while The Hunger Games has its share of fantasy elements they are modest by comparison to the epic sorcery of the Harry Potters or the vampire shtick of the Twilight Saga. Theres no getting around the grim premise of The Hunger Games and no getting around the sight of adolescents chopping each other up and blowing each other away. The violence isnt graphic but its ever-present. Lawrence with her determined scowl and aura of hyper-awareness anchors the movie as she should. Hutcherson is funny stoic steady-on as her running mate - as in running for their lives. Harrelson is less hammy than youd imagine given his wardrobe mock-tragic mien and pronouncements along the lines of ""Embrace the probability of your imminent death"" And then there is Elizabeth Banks virtually unrecognizable as the frivolous Effie Trinket a public relations maestro in corset and hats ""handling"" her District 12 charges with a ditsy but sinister busy-ness. It is with Panems power elite that The Hunger Games gets and looks most outlandish. Stanley Tucci is the pompous TV interviewer his hair in a bun tinted blue; Toby Jones is the foppish TV host; Wes Bentley with a close-cropped contoured beard that looks more like a facial tattoo is Seneca Crane the Gamemaker who oversees and often orchestrates the action - and literally unleashes the hounds when things get worrisome; and Donald Sutherland is the president a grave figure speechifying from on high. Theres a lot going on in The Hunger Games - pop-cult commentary an exploration of the violent undercurrents that run through society a not-so-subtle look at the widening gap between the haves and have-nots. There is teen angst there is teen romance and something that smells like teen spirit. But it also smells very much like a movie with money on its mind - not altogether successfully balancing its loftier ideas with a sense of superficial whimsy and Vegas-meets-Wizard of Oz production design. With one eye on the box office (and the sequels) The Hunger Games doesnt play it safe exactly. But it plays it awkwardly. Movie Review The Hunger Games 1/2 (out of four stars).

Share Tweet If Suzanne Collins novel The Hunger Games turns up on middle-school curricula 50 years from now--and as accessible dystopian science fiction with allusions to early-21st-century strife that isnt out of the question--the lazy students of the future can be assured that they can watch the movie version and still get better than a passing grade. But thats a dubious triumph A book is a book and a movie is a movie and whenever the latter merely sets about illustrating the former its a failure of adaptation to say nothing of imagination. When the goal is simply to be as faithful as possible to the material--as if a movie were a marriage and a rights contract the vow--the best result is a skillful abridgment one that hits all the important marks without losing anything egregious. And as abridgments go they dont get much more skillful than this one. That such a safe adaptation could come of The Hunger Games speaks more to the trilogys commercial ascent than the books actual content which is audacious and savvy in its dark calculations. In movie terms it suggests Paul Verhoeven in Robocop/Starship Troopers mode an R-rated bloodbath where the grim spectacle of children murdering each other on television is bread-and-circuses for the age of reality TV enforced by a totalitarian regime to keep the masses at bay. Its ""The Most Dangerous Game"" by way of The Running Man and Battle Royale with touches of Survivor and the mass-scale orchestration of The Truman Show. While Collins does include a love triangle a coming-of-age story and other YA-friendly elements in the mix they serve as a Trojan horse to smuggle readers into a hopeless world where love becomes a stratagem and growing up is a matter of basic survival. Displaying a sturdy professionalism throughout that stops just short of artistry director Gary Ross who co-scripted with Collins and Billy Ray does his strongest work in the early scenes which set up the stakes with chilling efficiency. The opening crawl (and a stirring propaganda movie) informs us that ""The Hunger Games"" are an annual event in Panem a North American nation divided into 12 different districts each in service to the Capitol a wealthy metropolis that owes its creature comforts to an oppressive dictatorship. For the 75 years since a district rebellion was put down The Games have existed as an assertion of the Capitals power a winner-take-all contest that touts heroism and sacrifice--participants are called ""tributes""-- while pitting the districts against each other. At ""The Reaping"" a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are taken from each district--with odds determined by age and the number of rations they accept throughout the year--and thrown into a controlled arena where theyre forced to kill each other until only one survives. In District 12 a dirt-poor coal-mining community that looks like a Dorothea Lange photograph Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) quietly rebels against the system by hunting game in a forbidden area with her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and trading it on the black market. Katniss prepares her meek younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) for her first Reaping but the odds of a single entry being selected among teenagers with many entries apiece are long. In the films most affecting scene those long odds turn against Prim in a shock that Ross renders in agonizing silence punctuated only by Katniss screaming that shell volunteer in her sisters place. Shes joined on the boys side by Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) a bakers son whose earnestness masks a gift for strategy that Katniss lacks. Together with the help of the drunkard Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) the only District 12 citizen ever to win the Games they challenge tributes that range from sadistic volunteers to crafty kids like the pint-sized Rue (Amandla Stenberg) to the truly helpless and soon-to-be-dead. The cast of characters doesnt stop there. Katniss also has a team of stylists led by Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) that cover up for her reticent personality with eye-catching makeup and wardrobe and shes trailed by the relentlessly perky Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) a sort of kabuki cheerleader for The Games and District 12. Then there are the enforcers of the Capital itself headed by the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and including a team of TV commentators (Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones) chief gamemaker Seneca (Wes Bentley) and the Peacekeepers in white stormtrooper get-ups. And on and on and on. Ross and his screenwriters do well with the unenviable task of setting the table for the series but with so many characters and subplots to service they have to ration as stingily as the Capital. The Reaping is one of the few sequences thats given time to breathe a little and it makes all the difference--the hushed crowd neither roused by propaganda nor open in resistance says everything about the fear and simmering resentment that stirs in the districts. Once Katniss volunteers The Hunger Games jets from one plot point to another without emphasizing any to great effect. Ross and company deliver on the franchise more effectively than say the first Harry Potter movie but theres little evidence that they had any other agenda in mind. The primary strength of Collins book is Katniss herself a model of steel-spined resourcefulness and power whose internal monologue roils with daft naivete and self-doubt especially when it comes to reading her supposed allies. Absent that monologue Ross film mostly has the books action and thats enough for a rousing two hours through the surreality of the Capital--which looks like Dubai meets Nuremberg--and the excitement of the Games themselves which are sanitized by the PG-13 rating but nonetheless suspenseful and dread-soaked. And beyond the mayhem are the periodic reminders that the Games are as rigged as any reality show; as with a casino its important that the house always wins even if that means making up the rules as it goes along. The Hunger Games has its share of standalone payoffs though some are too sketchily developed to have much of an impact like Katniss motherly connection to Rue. Nonetheless its the first act in a three-act story and characters who seem thin now may resonate more down the line. With all the dirty work out of the way perhaps the sequels will come closer to channeling the revolutionary fervor of Collins books and perhaps given the current focus on income inequality find a populist edge in the process. Whether the films will take on a life of their own is another matter As of the first installment its stenography in light.

"Movie review The Hunger Games - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Hunger Games a winning story of sacrifice and survival The Hunger Games Movie review by Kenneth Turan. Kenneth Turan reviews The Hunger Games. Kenneth Turan reviews The Hunger Games. Kenneth TuranLos Angeles Times Film Critic When youre talking about ""The Hunger Games"" it all comes down to Katniss. Like other strong-minded women who have driven book sales into the stratosphere -- think Lisbeth Salander of the ""Dragon Tattoo"" triology and even Bella Swan of the ""Twilight"" series -- ace archer Katniss Everdeen is an indomitable heroine whom nothing fazes or flusters for long. Making a successful ""Hunger Games"" movie out of Suzanne Collins novel required casting the best possible performer as Katniss and in Jennifer Lawrence director Gary Ross and company have hit the bulls-eye so to speak.Photos Meet the main cast of The Hunger Games An actress who specializes in combining formidable strength of will with convincing vulnerability Lawrence is the key factor in making ""Hunger Games"" an involving popular entertainment with strong narrative drive that holds our attention by sticking as close to the books outline as it can manage. As those whove seen Lawrences Oscar-nominated work in ""Winters Bone"" know playing Ree Dolly in that film gave the actress a head start on Katniss. Not only was Ree similarly determined and intrepid she paralleled Katniss in growing up poor in blighted surroundings and having to head the family after the departure of her father hampered her mothers ability to cope. Rees story however was set in the present while Katniss tale unfolds in a bleak future where a nation called Panem exists where the United States once stood. Every year to mark the anniversary of a peace treaty that ended a bloody rebellion each of Panems districts has to send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 known as tributes to the Capitol to participate in a brutal kill-or-be-killed event called the Hunger Games. Only one child comes out alive.Photos The Hunger Games premiere ""This is how we remember our past"" intones the official propaganda for this the 74th annual games set in a sizable wooded area that functions as an outdoor arena. ""This is how we safeguard our future."" So that no one misses the message numerous concealed cameras turn the Hunger Games into the ultimate in must-see TV for Panems residents. Collins came up with the idea for ""Hunger Games"" while switching between a reality TV show and coverage of the Iraq war. And the finished film though it combines elements familiar from short stories ""The Lottery"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"" does come off as a lethal ""Survivor"" or even""American Idol"" with deadly weapons. In District 12 where coal mining is a way of life and the people dress like characters from ""The Grapes of Wrath""16-year-old Katniss is primarily concerned with getting food for her family and bonding with her hunky best friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). But when her 12-year-old sister gets chosen as a tribute Katniss impulsively volunteers to take her place and heads off to the Capitol clutching a pin in the shape of a mockingjay (the visual symbol of both book and film) as a good luck charm.Photos Josh Hutcherson vs. Liam Hemsworth On the train to the Capitol Katniss exchanges glances with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) her fellow District 12 tribute and spends quality time with key players like the ebullient Effie Trinket (an unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) and the inebriated Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) a former champion who is supposed to mentor both Peeta and Katniss. At the Capitol an effete decadent place that looks like a 1930s image of futuristic architecture more characters materialize including Stanley Tuccis foppish host and Lenny Kravitzs sensitive pageant stylist. Preliminaries out of the way the games begin with roughly an hour gone and 90 minutes left on the clock. Since what happens during the Hunger Games should stay in the Hunger Games specifics of the combat will not be revealed here except to mention the presence of young actress Amandla Stenberg who makes a powerful impression as 12-year-old Rue. Though the film is faithful to the book the trio of practiced screenwriters (Ross who has a trio of Oscar script nominations author Collins and Billy Ray) have made some changes. The biggest one is elimination of the books first-person structure which allows for scenes -- such as private conversations between President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and head gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) -- that were not in the novel. Ross also makes the shrewd choice to have us frequently glimpse the unfolding games action on the huge TV screens the citizens of Panem are watching enhancing the uncomfortable intertwining of violence and voyeurism that is one of the storys themes. As to the kid-on-kid violence that has been the subject of so much talk Ross has managed to adroitly downplay that keeping the mayhem to a PG-13 level. Most of the children in the film want nothing to do with killing and the ones who do look considerably older than the heroines of previous ultra-violent films like ""Hanna"" and ""Kick-Ass."" Katniss of course is one of the reluctant participants and Lawrences ability to involve us in her struggle is a key to the effectiveness of ""Hunger Games."" The films strengths are not so much in its underlying themes or its romantic elements (the weakest aspect in fact) but its recognition of the books narrative strengths and its ability play them straight. If as the ads suggest the whole world will be watching this viewers will likely be satisfied with what they see.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment The Hunger Games Lifestyle and Leisure Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Meet the main cast / characters of The Hunger Games The Hunger Games Josh Hutcherson versus Liam Hemsworth Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrences fashion style Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-hunger-games-20120322,0,3577004.story?track=rss",200,thehungergames20,thehungergames,latimes

Movies good. Books still better.After a year of incessant pounding from the tribal drums of hype the film adaptation of ""The Hunger Games has arrived in theaters. The millions of readers young and old who devoured Suzanne Collinss future-shock adventure thriller and its two sequels will be satisfied on balance by the compromises Hollywood has made while keeping the story essentially true to itself. The many millions more who havent read the books may have a perfectly entertaining night at the movies while wondering what exactly the fuss was all about.Theres a scene early on in both book and film in which Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) the tough resourceful teenage heroine who has been chosen to represent her district in the nationally televised killing games of the title has her clothes set alight. Its part of her entrance into the Games lavish opening ceremonies and her assigned stylist Cinna (a quietly sympathetic Lenny Kravitz) has draped Katniss and her fellow District 12 contestant Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in capes that burst into flames without harming the wearer. The crowd goes wild; Katniss is immediately dubbed ""the girl on fire.Its a moment almost as effective on the screen as it is on the page but it illustrates the larger missed opportunity of the film one thats as much a matter of luck as of skill. This is not a movie on fire and it should have been. It may be that a pop franchise with this much profit potential is too valuable for any movie version to take chances. Perhaps thats why a dependable director like Gary Ross (""Pleasantville ""Seabiscuit) has been handed the reins to deliver the goods with tact and imagination (he also brings an overly wobbly camera). But one longs to know what a visionary stylist on the order of a David Fincher an Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men) or a ""Blade Runner-era Ridley Scott could have done with this material.What ""The Hunger Games does have is a game cast a large budget well spent Collins on board as co-writer and Lawrence as Katniss. Having already proven she can take a licking and keep on kicking in 2010s ""Winters Bone the 21-year-old actress is up to the storys physical challenges and ultimately its emotional ones. A gifted archer and hunter Katniss is an outsider in her mining community - she makes her living selling black-market game to support her mother (Paula Malcolmson) and younger sister (Willow Shields) - and when she takes the sisters place in the annual Reaping ceremony that sends contestants to the Games its with a sullenly ferocious sense of duty. If it takes a while for us to warm to this warrior its because it takes a while for her to warm to her task. But she does without sacrificing the canny survivors instinct that keeps Katniss alive and moviegoers interested. The Games have been devised by the ruling party in the Capital of Panem - all thats left of a post-apocalyptic America - to keep the rebellious populace of the districts in check and they are brutal. (The violence is not overly graphic but leave the little ones at home.) Scenes of carnage visited upon the weak and unlucky by stronger gamers like the alpha-male Cato (Alexander Ludwig) are harrowing. The novel is as much about strategy as about action - we see through Katnisss eyes as she lays her own plans and figures out everyone elses - and enough of that gamesmanship makes it into the film to hoist it above the norm. For the record the heroine makes the entire cast of the ""Twilight saga look like crybabies.One of the bigger mysteries is Peeta. Is he in love with Katniss or just saying that to build audience interest and attract sponsors whose gifts might save his life? Will he turn on her in the field? Hutcherson has been a solid utility player in family films for years now but hes starting to come of age as an actor and he does more with his characters ambiguity than I expected. One of the novels slyer jokes is that Peetas much better at the psychological long game and that Katniss (and thus the reader) takes forever to see that. But hes also the storys designated maiden-in-need-of-rescuing and Hutcherson has the soulfulness to make the inversion work.Not everything does; just enough. Ross and his CGI whiz team visualize the Capital as the high-tech Oz it should be (as compared with the WPA-era bleakness of the mines) and its decadent inhabitants are a multiculti-tutti-frutti bunch led by Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman the purple-haired Ryan Seacrest of Armageddon. Hes wonderful Donald Sutherland as President Snow is subtly menacing and Wes Bentley in the much-expanded role of Seneca Crane master of the Games has intriguingly satanic facial hair designed I guess to make us forget how closely the character is modeled on Ed Harriss Christof in ""The Truman Show.(If you want to count off this movies obvious inspirations by the way youll run out of fingers and toes. ""Truman Show and ""Wizard of Oz are joined by ""Logans Run ""The Running Man ""The Most Dangerous Game ""The 10th Victim ""1984 ""Big Brother ""Red Dawn and countless other influences and theres an angry online contingent of ""Battle Royale fans that want their 2000 drive-in Japanese classic left in peace. All of which proves that its never about where you get a story from but what you do with it that counts.)I wish the film had done more with the District 12 teams boozy savvy mentor Haymitch Abernathy whom Woody Harrelson invests with about 10 percent of his talent. (In fairness he doesnt have the screen time.) And poor Elizabeth Banks is lost beneath 8 pounds of Kabuki makeup and Tim Burton outerwear as Effie Trinket.The greater missed chance is Rue and fans of the book will know what I mean. The youngest and most vulnerable of the 24 contestants Rue bonds with Katniss in a relationship that on the page packs a wallop. Amandla Stenberg plays the role with sensitivity and fire but without the otherworldly spookiness that made the character so memorable and audiences unfamiliar with the source may question why theyre being asked to feel emotions the movie doesnt seem to have earned. In particular theres a loaf of bread that should be here and isnt. (What replaces it is a more epic scene meant to convey the oppressive nature of the Capitals regime information that arguably should have been made clearer at the movies start.)Like the book ""The Hunger Games doesnt end so much as open the door to the next installment; its frustrating but youll probably feel youve gotten your moneys worth. Somewhere in here though is a bigger more resonant movie that could have brushed against the storys allegorical anxieties how the grown-up world pits youth against itself; how the entertainment industry pushes violence and death for profit; how the world beyond high school can be a killing field - pick your paranoia.What weve been given instead is a very reasonable facsimile aimed at upsetting the fewest people while making the biggest amount of money.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

They hear the tale from a parent or their older siblings read a ""young adult"" book -- read it over and over because each new visit is like reconnecting with an old friend whose life is more fraught and much cooler than theirs. Then somebody makes a movie version which may be either the storys final validation or its dead end. Faced with this huge demanding fan base the adaptors of a popular novel loved by the young must balance fidelity with innovation. Change nothing in the transfer of the literary to the cinematic and risk boring or baffling the general audience. Change too much and the books fans will cry betrayal. Its not their old friend looking better than ever but a clone with a Hollywood smile. The filmmakers entrusted with the Harry Potter and Twilight books managed to please both constituencies. Can The Hunger Games in the movie version directed by Gary Ross successfully navigate the crossing from page to screen? Our answer Eh. As the films king baddie President Snow (Donald Sutherland) warns ""A little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous."" We advise acolytes of The Hunger Games and newcomers too to bring only a little hope to this long (2 hours and 22 minutes) pedestrian film. For the six of you who have somehow avoided Lionsgates wizardly worldwide media blitz The Hunger Games is the first volume of Suzanne Collinss trilogy set in Panem a North American dystopia perhaps a hundred years in the future. In the Capital city the foppish tyrants who run Panem stage an annual Hunger Games a kind of Survivor Thunderdome Olympics that lasts a few weeks and is mandatory TV viewing for all citizens Twenty-four children two from each Panem District are chosen at random and forced to kill each other off until only one the Victor remains to be rewarded with a life of plenty. The Games slogan -- ""And may the odds be ever in your favor"" -- twists the Jedi ""May the Force be with you"" into a sick joke the odds are 23 to 1 that a Tribute will end up dead. In the dirt-poor coal-mining region called District 12 the sturdy 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen supports her cherished younger sister Primrose and their wan mother by foraging furtively for game; named for the flower sagittaria also known as arrowhead she is an expert archer. When Primroses name is drawn to be the Districts female Tribute Katniss volunteers to go instead and leave behind her beau Gale. The boy chosen from District 12 is the callow but stalwart Peeta Mellark a bakers son who carries a secret torch for Katniss. Back in the freshet of the Hunger Games phenomenon in 2009 our Lev Grossman called the first two books ""a killer cocktail of Logans Run Lord of the Flies The Running Man reality TV and the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur."" He might have added The Truman Show (for the TV cameras hidden throughout the forest environment to catch every pursuit and fatality) Oliver Twist (for the children forced by adults into criminal behavior) Romeo and Juliet (for the poison that two lovers plan to take) and centrally Richard Connells 1924 story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" whose scenario of a mad Cossack trapping humans on his Caribbean island and hunting them down like big game has inspired a couple dozen Hollywood films. (READ Lev Grossman on The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) The movie of The Hunger Games starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta might be expected to err on the side of fidelity since Collins served as executive producer and helped write the screenplay. Most of the books set pieces are here the fateful drawing of names by District 12 ""Escort"" Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks); the hazing-mentoring of Katniss and Peeta by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) a Victor long since in his cups; the contestants televised chats with smarmy Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) which proceed like a Miss America pageant if it were shown on Bravo; Katnisss interview with her prospective patrons whom she startled by one-upping William Tell and shooting an arrow out of a roast pigs mouth; and the grueling ordeal of the Games in the woods where the deaths mount from arrow harpoon machete and genetically altered wasps -- ""tracker-jackers."" On this killing field Katniss and Peeta must decide whether to kill each other and win or form a wary alliance and risk dying together -- for according to the inflexible rules only one can survive. Except that Collins is cavalier with her caveats. Now she changes the rules. Nope changing back again. Oops changing back to the first change. By the end narrative twists seem like authorial dithering. Ross who directed young Tobey Maguire in Pleasantville (a dystopian fantasy set in the past) and Seabiscuit shows a similar skill with the 21-year-old Lawrence who earned an Oscar nomination in another sylvan tale of dread Winters Bone. No wafer-thin waif like Twilights Kristen Stewart Lawrence can be a giddy motormouth in interviews (as she was on Tuesday with David Letterman) but her screen persona in Winters Bone and The Burning Plain and as Raven-Mystique in X-Men First Class is sullen stolid slablike. She could be the heroine of one of Robert Bressons French epics of minimalist misery -- his Joan of Arc or Mouchette -- and that makes her close to ideal as the too-tough-to-cry Katniss. Hutcherson the kid in Journey to the Center of the Earth and Journey 2 The Mysterious Island has to play Peeta as the softer of the two lead characters. In any other action film hed be the sensitive fellow whom the real hero risks his life to save. Maybe hell make a stronger impression in the films that are sure to be made from the later books in the trilogy. The novel narrated by Katniss visualizes District 12 as a Dorothea Lange photo-montage of Appalachian poverty and the Capital city in District 1 as a Tea Party members horrified vision of downtown Manhattan night life in the swinging 70s. The movie tries to capture some of that wretched excess the outre couture and coiffure of the one-percenters defines their decadence. Effie is done up like a Lewis Carrolls Red Queen time-traveling to Louis XIVs court; the beard of Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) is as artfully manicured as the flames painted on a clown car. Think Fellini but with less brio. Thats the movies problem its better at grim than gaudy but not masterly at either. Katniss in the flaming red dress she wears to the Games opening may be ""the girl on fire"" but the film rarely combusts. Ross doesnt dare have too much fun with the ruling vultures -- their excesses might seem ugh appealing -- and good actors like Tucci and Toby Jones (as Caesars color commentator) have trouble locating the right tone of precision within flamboyance. Only Banks triumphs; she plays Effie with a delicately deranged comic grace; she can turn a simple word like ""room"" into a tweeting polysyllabic melody. The film springs fitfully to life when the Games begin. Rosss support team -- 69 propmakers and five second-unit directors including Oscar-winning auteur Steven Soderbergh -- makes the giant arena a forest to die in. Amandla Sternberg adds underage winsomeness as Rue Katnisss ally and mascot; and the scene in which our heroine uses her archery skills to blow up a pile of booty (another arrow through a piece of fruit sets off the land mines) is smartly managed. But Ross lacks the action-directors skill of lending heft to violent activity while hewing to PG-13 guidelines. The movie flinches when death nears; theres no kick to the kills. (READ Is The Hunger Games Too Dark for Kids?) Collins didnt have to worry about a movie rating when she sat down to write The Hunger Games. Though meant for teen readers the novel vibrates with a relentless passion that put the reader inside Katnisss mind and guts. The reading experience could be rated R -- not for the gore and not for the sex (there is none) but for the ferocity of the prose. But that was a book; this is a movie a commodity aiming for a billion-dollar worldwide gross. What Ross has created is a dutiful spectacle -- as if his name had been drawn at random and the job were not the chance of a lifetime but a slog to the death. Put it another way If they made books out of movies this Hunger Games would never see print.

Starring Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Jennifer Lawrence Wes Bentley Woody Harrelson Amandla Stenberg Lenny Kravitz Donald Sutherland Director Gary Ross Running time 222 Release Opened Mar 23 2012  Editorial Review The Hunger Games brought faithfully if un-spectacularly to life By Ann HornadayWednesday March 21 2012 Like the documentaries ""Kony 2012"" and ""Bully"" the grim speculative fantasy ""The Hunger Games"" has been a Web sensation in recent weeks garnering the kind of pre-opening buzz and advance ticket-sales that make the most cynical Hollywood studio suit giggle like a schoolgirl. And like ""Kony"" and ""Bully"" this adaptation of the hit young adult novel centers on grievous violence and children who in author Suzanne Collinss floridly post-apocalyptic future are subjected to an annual ritual wherein they murder each other as part of a nationwide reality show. That perverse dystopia is brought faithfully if un-spectacularly to life by director Gary Ross in ""The Hunger Games"" which hews to the most important contours of Collinss book the first of a trilogy. If the seriess legions of fans miss a detail here or a sub-plot there theyll still recognize its bones and sinew especially in Jennifer Lawrences eagle-eyed heroine Katniss Everdeen who combines the unapologetic aggression of Artemis with the girlier wish-fulfillment fantasies of a bemused Cinderella. As explained in a brief prologue and later during a helpfully inserted piece of propaganda the Hunger Games -- a cross between the Olympics Outward Bound and ""Survivor"" -- have been instituted by the elite leaders of a country called Panem in order to keep down a restive populace. After randomly plucking a boy and a girl from each of the federations districts a shadowy government-entertainment complex subjects them to a kill-or-be-killed group hunt from which only one victor can emerge. (Panems leader President Snow is portrayed with silky malevolence by Donald Sutherland.) One of the trickier aspects of bringing ""The Hunger Games"" to the screen is to avoid indulging in the very voyeuristic spectacle the story is supposed to be condemning. Ross -- whose films include such anodyne mainstream fare as ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville"" -- judiciously sidesteps the most barbaric aspects of Collinss tale saving it from becoming a Scholastic version of Cormac McCarthy at his most ruthless. Still theres no escaping the depravity of Collinss essential premise The number of young people who die pitiless deaths could populate the cast of ""Glee"" but only one possesses real moral weight with Katniss or the audience. If Ross glosses over the storys bleakest aspects he brings the bread and circuses of Collinss story to life with lurid color or primitive brutishness depending on the setting often within a jangle of jarring close-ups captured with a constantly bobbing hand-held camera. The region Katniss and Peeta represent the coal mines and hollers of District 12 seems to have popped straight out of Walker Evanss dark room; the Capitol -- a Vegas-like hive of callous sophisticates and jaded fashionistas -- looks like Oz by way of Albert Speer. (It remains to be seen whether ""The Hunger Games"" and its Draconian burlesque of centralized government will make it a dog-whistle hit with Tea Party audiences.) The stoic impassive Katniss threads her way through the Capitol with the dubious help of a chaperone named Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) whose kooky fin de siecle style includes white-powdered wigs candy-colored costumes and rosebud lips and a mentor named Haymitch Abernathy played by Woody Harrelson in a soddenly bravura turn that somehow combines his two most recent roles the corrupt cop in ""Rampart"" and a world-weary political consultant in ""Game Change."" Stanley Tucci finds his inner Silvio Berlusconi as a tooth-capped spray-tanned blue-haired TV host named Caesar. That name -- as well as the monikers Seneca and Cato -- is clearly meant to underline ""The Hunger Games "" roots in the Coliseum a gratuitous reminder made more unnecessary once the young gladiators finally join the battle. That comes more than an hour in after the movie devotes a good deal of time to Katnisss harrowing decision to volunteer for the games then to her training-cum-makeover overseen by Cinna a benevolent fashion consultant played with welcome warmth by Lenny Kravitz. (True to the book he confects a red-carpet debut for Katniss that literally sizzles.) Liam Hemsworth appears in a blink-and-youll-miss-him few scenes as Katnisss best friend Gale and Josh Hutcherson -- last seen in ""The Kids are All Right"" -- does a terrific job of playing Katnisss lovelorn co-competitor Peeta. But once they enter the vast ""Truman Show""-esque arena ""The Hunger Games"" is clearly Lawrences movie to carry. She shoulders that burden with the same quiet compelling focus and raw-boned directness she exhibited in 2010s ""Winters Bone"" in which she played essentially the same character a fatherless indomitably self-reliant teenager who embarks on a life-and-death journey to provide for the ineffectual mother and siblings who depend on her. Like ""Winters Bone"" before it ""The Hunger Games"" goes to torturous even off-putting extremes to prove its heroines mettle. (The movie isnt likely to win over anyone who isnt already enthralled by the book.) But Lawrence is never less than grounded and believable as a young woman forced by circumstance to assume wisdom far beyond her years. As Katniss -- a tough loner who perfectly embodies the anxieties obsessions and self-sustaining narratives of the young women who idolize her -- Lawrence seems to slip effortlessly into the same persona that made her a star. And she wont need to shed it anytime soon if ""The Hunger Games"" becomes the juggernaut it promises to be. It turns out that Katniss Everdeen is the ideal heroine for her age -- a steely but sympathetic transitional figure between the masochism of Bella Swan and the avenging ferocity of Lisbeth Salander. A deer stalker dressed in pyrotechnic couture Katniss symbolizes a new post- ""Project Runway"" brand of female power one that entails not just strength courage and spiky if selective compassion but also a top-notch stylist. Contains intense violent thematic material and disturbing images -- all involving teens.

Unlike Brake in which the thrills are generated by people the sci-fi adventure The Hunger Games relies heavily on CGI effects in a variety of visual formats--2D and Imax. Thank goodness it wasnt in 3D. As a wearer of distance glasses I loathe the revival of 3D a silly gimmick for kids from the 1950s that blighted everything from Bwana Devil to Kiss Me Kate and mercifully died out with House of Wax. So I was grateful to watch The Hunger Games without the discomfort of two pairs of glasses and dont feel like I missed a thing. I can live without another flying spear. This futuristic tale of teenage violence is so not my kind of movie that I approached it grudgingly so imagine my surprise when I ended up being totally exhilarated and enjoying it immensely. Based on the teenage cult novel by Suzanne Collins that I admit in my ignorance I had never heard of The Hunger Games takes place in some distant world called Panem that was once America before the Capitol was defeated in some unexplained apocalyptic war. As punishment for the aggression the wreckage was divided into 12 districts. Every year each district must send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 chosen by lottery to compete in a nationally televised event called ""the Hunger Games."" The purpose a mass killing spree with only one survivor. Everyone shows up at the Hall of Justice to watch just as the ancient Romans cheered the Christians when they were eaten alive by lions in the Colosseum. Part spectator sport part law and part show business the ""games"" are the World Series of the Holocaust of Tomorrow. The winner serves as a metaphor for honor courage and sacrifice. What gives this 74th years event special TMZ appeal is that the two 16-year-old contestants from the 12th district are a pretty girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence from Winters Bone) and an even prettier boy named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson from The Kids Are All Right) who in the process of becoming warriors fall in love. The publicity value of two lovers fighting until one kills the other in order to survive gives the games a special edge that guarantees ratings. If she were still around Oprah would have them on her show. Its a nasty but transfixing idea and Shirley Jackson got there first with her unforgettable classic ""The Lottery."" But still the myriad details in the screenplay Ms. Collins adapted herself and the colorful direction by Gary Ross provide enough stimulation for three movies in the same genre. From the ""reapings"" where the contestants are chosen by drawing numbers to the lavishly appointed dining car on a train to the Capitol where they meet their mentor a cynical drunken reprobate named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson in a long blond hippie wig) to the 100000 cheering spectators gathered for the blood spill like the dress extras from Quo Vadis we watch the teams with their costumes and pageantry preparing for the slaughter. The master of ceremonies is a campy Caesar (played by Stanley Tucci as a cross between Liberace and one of the trashy Kardashians). Injected with a tracking system that reveals their whereabouts at all times they are transported to the playing fields. Equipped with knives swords bows and arrows and other weapons of choice they begin the massacre. In one poetic image a butterfly lands on Ms. Lawrences finger in battle the last symbol of freedom she will know. Forests of land mines a lethal hive of poisonous wasps that cause pain hallucinations and death called ""Trackerjackers"" and nuclear fires are among the many CGI effects unleashed like torpedoes. Its all supposed to be mind-boggling but excuse me. In an age of reality TV when 90 percent of everything on the tube has turned ugly vulgar and stupid the movie lacks a necessary sense of creepy tension. It just looks like what you saw the night before on the latest installment of Survivor. Still its entertaining. And you find yourself rooting for the lovers who literally kill themselves to stay together. The cruelty of the games results in a civil war mob protests and a revision of the rules allowing two winners instead of one as long as they both come from the same district. Now all Katniss and Peeta have to do is find each other in the wilderness in time for a final fadeout. No wonder The Hunger Games is so popular with young readers. It has a message about the triumph of good over evil. It has romance action danger expensive eye candy flamboyant villains teenage carnage two attractive leads who symbolize honor courage and sacrifice and it ends with a kiss. It might even end with a profit. The publicity machine is already cranked at full throttle. Or it could crash and burn like the ridiculous ill-fated John Carter. Kids have invented new ways to spend their allowance money and it doesnt always end up at the box office. rreedobserver.com HUNGER GAMES Running Time 142 minutes Written by Gary Ross (screenplay) and Suzanne Collins (screenplay) Directed by Gary Ross Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth 2.5/4 Comment Filed under Gary Ross hunger games Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth movie Movie Review suzanne collins Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2012/03/hunger-games-jennifer-lawrence-suzanne-collins-liam-hemsworth-gary-ross-rex-reed/,200,thehungergames24,thehungergames,observer

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Thats more than you can say for the castration job that the suits did on Stephenie Meyers Twilight franchise. Ill admit that Games isnt the scary eruptive firecracker of my dark Tarantino-fueled imagination. And if youre among the 26 million who devoured the Collins trilogy - The Hunger Games followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay - you know it could have been. But even wearing a PG-13 harness to ensure profitability The Hunger Games gets your pulse racing. Its about something pertinent the mission to define yourself in a world thats spinning off its moral axis. As 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen the renegade hunter who kills with a bow and arrow and stands up to take the place of her younger sister in the deadly Games Lawrence reveals a physical and emotional grace thats astonishing. Give her the deed because she owns this movie. Its not just that Katniss makes Twilights Bella Swan look like the wimp she is its that Lawrence 21 is an acting dynamo with the skills to let us into Katniss searching mind. Last year Lawrence won an Oscar nomination for playing an Ozark girl in Winters Bone. Shes just as affecting this time lending primal force to this dystopian fable of a society out of sync with human values. At 142 minutes The Hunger Games can go from rushed to draggy. But director Gary Ross (Pleasantville Seabiscuit) hits the high spots using action to define character instead of obliterate it. He wisely brought in Collins to collaborate on the script he wrote with Billy Ray (Shattered Glass). That way even when the books events are condensed or characters eliminated the feeling stays true. The Games are a punishment invented by the Capitol of Panem (read North America) for the 12 districts whose rebellion against Capitol rule was crushed more than 74 years ago. The attitude of President Snow (Donald Sutherland wily in his evil) is ""You screwed us so well screw you."" Every year on Reaping Day a boy and a girl (ages 12 to 18) from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a televised gladiator event devised by head Games-maker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). Ratings are not a problem. Even in downtrodden District 12 where Katniss hunts for scraps to feed her sister and her widowed mother viewing the Games is mandatory. You wont need your arm twisted to see the movie artfully shot by Tom Stern (Mystic River) as the scene shifts from the perverse lushness of the Capitol to the stark landscape of the battle zone. And did I mention makeovers? All the Tributes (thats what contenders are called) get them. Katniss has fashion genius Cinna (Lenny Kravitz doing a fun spin on Tom Ford) to create a wow dress that bursts into flame at the hem. Nice one. Like Bella before her Katniss is pursued by two laddies-in-waiting in this case Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) the strapping District 12 hunk and fellow illegal hunter she leaves behind and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) the bakers son who joins Katniss in the Games and secretly pines for her. Are you Team Gale or Team Peeta? You might not care as much since neither has the exotic allure of a vampire or a wolf. But Hemsworth (The Last Song with girlfriend Miley Cyrus) quickly establishes a strong appealing presence. And Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right) brings humor and a bruised heart to a boy who needs to mature fast. Dynamite actors dot the film. Stanley Tucci is a brilliant blend of mirth and malice as Caesar Flickerman a TV host who reps the dark side of Ryan Seacrest in this lethal version of American Idol. Elizabeth Banks brings malicious wit to the bewigged and powdered PR guru Effie Trinket. ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" announces Effie with inane sincerity. And the reliably stellar Woody Harrelson cuts deep as the perpetually shitfaced Haymitch Abernathy a former victor in the Games now acting as mentor to both Katniss and Peeta. When hes not falling-down drunk Haymitch instructs his proteges on how to suck up to sponsors who send supplies into the arena when a Tribute wins audience favor. So-called reality TV is given a sharp satirical kick as Tributes learn to play and pander to hidden cameras. Is Katniss really falling for Peeta as she nurses his wounds or is she faking it to save her ass and his? Discuss. Sadly the erotic heat that Collins generates between Katniss and Peeta in a hidden cave never rises above room temperature onscreen. Hand-to-hand combat does fuel the intensity as Katniss fights career Tributes trained to go medieval on enemy ass. Check out machete-wielding Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and knife-throwing Clove (Isabelle Fuhrman) not to mention a swarm of deadly genetically engineered wasps called Tracker Jackers. The caring bond Katniss forms with Rue (Amandla Stenberg) the youngest Tribute is just a brief break from the assaults aimed to make Katniss trade her soul for survival. For all its compromises The Hunger Games is a zeitgeist movie that captures the spirit of a soul-sucking age in which ego easily trumps common cause. Ironically the kill-to-win ethos that dominates movies from 1987s prophetic The Running Man to the undiluted brutality of Japans Battle Royale in 2000 may find its largest viewership in The Hunger Games. But will mainstream audiences respond to the moral challenge churning under the pop-culture razzle-dazzle? Its anybodys guess. My advice is to keep your eyes on Lawrence who turns the movie into a victory by presenting a heroine propelled by principle instead of hooking up with the cutest boy. Thats what makes Katniss revolutionary. May the odds be ever in her favor.

Photo ""The Hunger Games"" may be derivative but it is engrossing and at times exciting. Implicitly it argues that ""The Truman Show"" might have been improved by Ed Harris lobbing fireballs at Jim Carrey and its now clear what ""American Idol"" was missing all those years a crossbow for Simon Cowell. This cracking adventure of the future keeps things moving for 2 1/4 hours and marks a refreshing turn for a blockbuster to the human and away from superpowers Nobody (at least among the protagonists) can do anything magical and the action scenes (all but one of which are superbly done) are intense and intimate. The movie begins with kids from all over the country being rounded up and sent to a central location to try to kill each other. This tradition used simply to be called ""boys boarding school"" but now its co-ed sci-fi. The Hunger Games are a live TV event like a literal ""Survivor"" Only one of the 24 young people (two from each of 12 districts) can live. READ MORE HUNGER GAMES SOUNDTRACK IS HERE PHOTOS HUNGER GAMES FUTURE STARS INSIDE THE MAKING OF THE HUNGER GAMES MOVIE PHOTOS THE FASHION GAMES JENNIFER LAWRENCES CLEAVAGE THE STAR OF THE HUNGER GAMES"" NEW YORK SCREENING In the poorest Appalachia-like district teen Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is growing up modestly inside a Johnny Cash song (coal mines railroads filet of varmint on the stove) when her little sister is randomly selected for the Hunger Games. She volunteers to take the kids place and heads to the Capitol city as a heavy underdog. Except shes really the overdog isnt she? She grew up in the kind of wilderness where the Games take place and she is handy with a bow and arrow. She even knows which berries not to eat. Socioeconomically she is not one of the chosen. But in survival she should be a heavy favorite against suburban kids who couldnt find the nearest diner without a Yelp app. The Capitol is a sort of Sharper Image version of Oz (or if you prefer picture Las Vegas by John Galliano). There she gets advice from her designated mentor (Woody Harrelson whose character morphs from being a useless drunk to an invaluable sage for no reason I could detect) has fancy meals with a ditzy representative of the Games (Elizabeth Banks channeling Paula Abdul dressed by Marie Antoinette) and appears on the chat show hosted by the smarmy emcee of the live TV broadcast of the games. This is Stanley Tucci wearing a vast blue wig giving maybe the least interesting performance of his Ive ever seen. Also on the same show Katniss learns someone has a crush on her her acquaintance and fellow District 12 gladiator (Josh Hutcherson barely registering a pulse -- somebody get this kid a Red Bull IV). Plotwise the movie has problems A big development happens because of coincidence (Katniss overhears key exposition) theres an unlikely alliance an attacker makes the mistake of giving a lengthy speech before finishing off a victim the villains arent interesting and the TV satire is about as bitter as a marshmallow (unlike in the similar but nastier Schwarzenegger movie ""The Running Man"" in which Richard Dawson was despicably amusing). This last factor I think has to do with how youth today equates television and validation. No longer is TV the idiot box. Its the holy key to the kingdom of fame. Then theres Hollywoods never-ending quandary about what to do with black people. Wait heres an idea Have them play helpful subordinates to white heroes. Fans of the book will be peeved by the lack of development of secondary characters. (I was more annoyed that the primary characters dont really come into focus either despite the long running time.) At his best though director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") is expert at keeping up suspense mainly by being stingy with info about how this alternate world is set up (here again readers of the book will lose out since they already know the details). He also does a fine job handling the most harrowing moments such as when Katniss must decide as the Games begin whether to run for a cache of weapons or run away. Running the camera close on Lawrence as she fights hand to hand or fires an arrow Ross keeps the audience breathlessly right there next to her. Like the Harry Potter movies though this one is essentially a sellout. Its been a long time since Willy Wonka set out to identify and correct kids moral failings. Now kids movies tell us that what adults mainly need to do is recognize and cheer the wonderfully amazing awesomeness of young people preferably by giving them hair and makeup consultants and TV deals.

Instead of todays narrow-casted onslaught of Internet cable and satellite entertainment theres one TV channel and one reality show which occupies the entire culture as nothing has in the real world since perhaps O.J.s Bronco chase or the Challenger disaster. In Panem ""Hunger Games"" author Suzanne Collins nightmarish future version of America its as if the first season of ""Survivor"" or ""American Idol"" is on the air year after year with real killings no competition and ratings that never go down.Its an interesting scenario I suppose but how did this happen? Nothing in Collins books or in director Gary Ross simultaneously chaotic and desultory film adaptation even tries to explain that (or seems aware of it as a narrative problem). Somewhere amid the civil war and widespread destruction and rise of a totalitarian state that forms the scanty back story of ""The Hunger Games"" the collective knowingness and jadedness and pseudo-sophistication of the Information Revolution society has evaporated. Or at least it has among the subject populations in the outlying districts annually compelled to supply young combatants to the Hunger Games. Where Collins heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence in the movie) grows up in the Appalachian coal-mining zone called District 12 willowy women in print dresses with flyaway hair live in tumbledown shacks looking for all the world as if they just stepped out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay from 1937. (Have blue jeans for women and indoor plumbing been abolished along with consumer society corporate capitalism and postmodernity in general?)If that sounds like too much intellectual heavy lifting to apply to a girl-centric action-romance that mashes up a bunch of disparate influences and ingredients from Greek mythology to Orwell to Stephen King well it probably is. My point is that the patchwork of ""The Hunger Games"" never really holds together or makes any sense except as an elementary fairy tale about a young girls coming of age and an incipient romantic triangle (which is the focus of the film far more than the book). In Collins novel the first-person narration and Katniss intense physical and psychological struggle seize center stage and overwhelm the threadbare situation at least to some degree. Ross movie version -- co-written by him Collins and Billy Ray -- is probably adequate to satisfy hardcore fans but only just. Its a hash job that offers intriguing moments of social satire and delightful supporting performances but subsumes much of the books page-turning drama to sub-""Twilight"" teen romance. Of course it will make a zillion dollars opening weekend but Im not convinced this franchise will be as ginormous in the long run as Hollywood hopes.Its easy to be seduced by something thats both as clever and as successful as ""The Hunger Games"" and to conclude that it must have something to say about violence and the media and changing ideas of femininity and other hot-button topics it appears to address. But as becomes even clearer in the movie version it really doesnt. Its a cannily crafted entertainment that refers to ideas without actually possessing any beyond an all-purpose populism that could appeal just as easily to a Tea Partyer as to a left-winger. If not more so -- the true villain of ""The Hunger Games"" is the all-powerful state and the population of Panems capital city (in Ross movie and to some extent in the book too) is a decadent affected and polysexual media elite whose outrageous peacock fashions suggest the court of Marie Antoinette appearing in a Duran Duran video.In fact ""The Hunger Games"" is precisely the thing it pretends to disapprove of a pulse-elevating spectacle meant to distract us from the unsatisfying situation of the real world and to offer a simulated outlet for youthful disaffection and anxiety (in this case the anxieties of girls and young women in particular). Bread and circuses only without the bread and pretending to be anti-circus. Im not claiming thats anything new in pop culture and it certainly isnt a crime. Furthermore the shapeless politics of ""The Hunger Games"" have very little to do with the question of whether its any good although they do illustrate how calculated the whole project is.About one ingredient there can be little question ""The Hunger Games"" announces Jennifer Lawrences arrival as an A-list movie star likely at or near the level of ""Twilights"" Kristen Stewart. Im not sure that Ross -- a longtime Hollywood insider who co-wrote ""Big"" for Tom Hanks and wrote and directed ""Seabiscuit"" -- asks Lawrence to do half as much acting as she did in ""Winters Bone"" but she commands the screen with effortless magnetism a noble innocent who is gorgeous but not quite sexy simultaneously a tomboy and a princess. As I saw clearly for the first time the character is clearly meant to invoke Artemis the Greek goddess of the hunt. When her younger sisters name is drawn against all odds at the annual ""reaping"" for Hunger Games contestants Katniss steps forward to take her place beginning her appointment with destiny and her confrontation with the cruelty of the Capitol. Shes leaving behind her friend hunting partner and maybe-kinda boyfriend Gale played woodenly or perhaps beefily by smoldering male-model type Liam Hemsworth. You Might Also Like As Collins readers already know Katniss must battle to the death against 23 other ""tributes"" aged 12 to 18 -- one boy and one girl from each of the 12 subservient districts -- in an arena that appears to be a natural outdoor setting but may not be. Now we know why Ross and the films producers didnt show us any footage of the actual Hunger Games combat in advance They hadnt shot any until last week. OK thats unfair. Most of the books Games encounters are here in abbreviated form but Ross and company have streamlined the story and altered several details (some significantly) and the whole thing feels ultra-perfunctory. Almost no actual bloodshed is depicted (in deference to the required PG-13 rating) and during the fight sequences cinematographer Tom Stern relies on a wobbly nonsensical quick-cut style that leaves you utterly unsure about who has killed whom and may have you squeezing your eyes shut to avoid throwing up. The problem really isnt the lack of explicit violence; far more important we get no sense of the hunger thirst cold disease and harrowing physical torment undergone by Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the shy blond District 12 bakers son who has long loved her from afar. OK they get a few superficial nicks and scratches but they look as well-fed and runway-ready in the second half of the movie as they did at the beginning.I have many more bones to pick with the Games -- the Cornucopia used by the game designers to lure contestants into a free-for-all? So bogus -- but when you pull back and look at the fripperies around the edges of Ross ""Hunger Games"" it becomes much more entertaining and nearly worthwhile. Stanley Tucci is amazing as Caesar Flickerman the host of the Hunger Games broadcast. All of a sudden this universe without media savvy becomes all about media savvy all wrapped into this unctuous persona whose sincerity is so fake it becomes real (or the other way around) and whose dazzling smile is at once comforting and terrifying. As he so often can Woody Harrelson turns Haymitch a drunken past winner of the Games from Katniss district into a fascinating and mysterious figure even though the script gives him little to do. Wes Bentley plays a game designer who must frequently consult with Panems sinister president (Donald Sutherland apparently playing Brigham Young) in expository scenes that arent in the book but provide helpful background. I also dug Lenny Kravitz playing a stylist named Cinna who grooms Katniss for the Games -- the only person she meets in the decadent Capitol who has a shred of genuineness or integrity -- and becomes her confidant. In his sly androgynous sexiness Kravitz has way more chemistry and connection with Lawrence than do Hemsworth or Hutcherson playing the two lunkheads supposedly smitten with Katniss. Id way rather watch a love story about Katniss and Cinna than the lightweight Twi-triangle inflicted on us by Ross who has (with Collins permission evidently) stripped his heroine of almost all her Artemis-like uncertainty about boys and romance. (In the book you couldnt be quite sure Katniss wasnt a lesbian at least at first.)But were not getting Katniss and Cinna of course and we dont get anything that feels remotely like an ending in this clunky clumsy adaptation; the story reaches a certain point and the curtain simply drops. Wait another year and spend another 12 and youll get another chapter. Maybe Im old-fashioned but that just seems mean (and neither the Harry Potter nor the ""Twilight"" series were quite this blatant about it). I realize it will probably work or work well enough. ""The Hunger Games"" has some cool moments here and there and is never entirely dreadful. Lawrence is both radiant and triumphant.

Sales figures for Suzanne Collins best-selling ""Hunger Games"" novels say yes but this inaugural adaptation seem less sure. Though its violence can be rough and its satire sharp the movie feels softened by its PG-13 rating and only glancingly illuminates the books darker Orwellian themes. Its solid and serious-minded particularly for an aspiring blockbuster and the attractive cast should satisfy fans. But theres a smarter tougher film hiding inside this one. Speaking of smart and tough our heroine is Katniss Everdeen a young huntress from rural District 12 played with grit and bottled-up emotion by Jennifer Lawrence (""Winters Bone""). Local boy Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson ""The Kids Are All Right"") seems a wan presence but its clear why he yearns for Katniss Shes a teenage Diana bowstring ever-taut against flushed cheek. Their loyalty will be put to the test in the annual Hunger Games a lethal Olympiad with only one winner. Director Gary Ross (""Seabiscuit"") works hard to visualize Collins elaborate dystopia with mixed results The tyrannical Capitol city looks like West Berlin guarded by ""Star Wars"" Stormtroopers while Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci as various Games celebrities wear zany Mad Hatter outfits.

A withering indictment of omnipresent screens endless spectacle and debased celebrity culture The Hunger Games was inspired the author has said by flipping the channels from a reality-TV show to footage of the Iraq war. Most of Collinss critique then is compromised by the very existence of this big-screen transfer itself the most anticipated spectacle of the spring. (The novelist who both co-wrote the script with director Gary Ross and Billy Ray and executive-produced is apparently fine with the contradiction.)Set in an unspecified postapocalyptic future The Hunger Games takes place in Panem a nation constructed out of the ruins of North America and consisting of 12 mostly impoverished districts and the prosperous Capitol. (For those unfamiliar with the book this backstory is told quickly through opening intertitles.) As punishment for an earlier uprising--and as a reminder of its complete control over its citizens--the Capitol demands that one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district be selected via annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games. Now in its 74th edition this televised pageant of nonstop gore (and mandatory viewing) documents the 24 randomly drawn teenagers killing each other until only one remains.This years female ""tribute"" from District 12--one of Panems most destitute regions a coal-mining center located in the former Appalachia--is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) a flinty 16-year-old who volunteers for the slaughter so that her beloved fragile younger sister whose name has just been called will be spared. Two years ago Lawrence played a similar character in the present-day Ozarks-set Winters Bone the unyielding survivalist roasting squirrels over a spit forced at too young an age to become a caretaker and fighting off many who would like to see her dead. The earlier association enhances Lawrences role here; the actress more solidly built than her wispy contemporaries has a particular gift for exuding iron determination and dead-eyed exhaustion--like a junior version of one of Dorothea Langes Migrant Mothers.Other cultural referents dont work as well. When Katniss and her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) travel from their hardscrabble region to the gleaming Oz-like Capitol the citys opulence and depravity are conveyed via male citizens who look like members of the Lollipop Guild as styled by SNLs Stefon. Decadence is coded as unmistakably gay among the men in Capitol crowd scenes and the primpers who prepare Katniss for her pre-Hunger Games American Idol-style interviews; these nellie Day-Glo steampunkers suggest that we can blame Project Runway for the end of civilization. (Katnisss chief stylist Cinna played by an excellent Lenny Kravitz is more ambiguously metrosexual.) Other significant set pieces from Collinss novel look laughably pitiful when realized on-screen The Cornucopia the horn-shaped warehouse to which the tributes race at the beginning of the Games to pick up supplies eliminating many competitors in the process resembles a Frank Gehry-designed titanium turd.For the films most difficult visual challenge--depicting the unrelenting violence of the source so that it is neither cynically glamorized nor too brutal to preclude pubescents from buying tickets--Ross who previously directed Pleasantville and Seabiscuit and cinematographer Tom Stern smartly deploy rapid cuts and quick shots of the aftermath of the kid-on-kid savagery. A palm-size pool of blood a vacant stare a body going limp all effectively communicate the horrors of what just happened with sufficient impact. Like the pacing of the novel the film even at almost two and a half hours moves briskly continuously drawing us in.And yet at the risk of indulging in tired pointless debates about page versus screen it is impossible for this movie to ever hope to match the fury of the book. Collins is no great prose stylist but through her very premise she astringently articulates her anger at a culture--ours--indifferent to inequity and war and besotted with its own stupidity. (Horrifyingly you have the sense while reading that these televised Survivor-style kiddie kills seem all too likely to be realized one day.) But the books rage and despair are diluted here focusing too much on the high-tech gimmickry of the Gamemakers who arbitrarily insert obstacles--fire mutant dogs--that further imperil the tributes. Although the novel might make concessions to the conventions of young-adult lit--Katniss and Peeta form two points of a love triangle; the third is waiting for her back in District 12--Collinss heroine is in one of the source materials most gripping sections perilously close to dying from dehydration. That slow awful process is not dramatized on-screen To do so would require an investment in a deeper more existential and lonely terror that Rosss movie refuses to broach.

"Hunger Games The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hunger-games-the ) Hunger Games The (United States 2012) March 20 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Hunger Games comes charging out of the gate with a daunting task fill the chasm in the fangirl cinematic franchise machine created by the completion of the Harry Potter saga and the impending end to all things Twilight. The Hunger Games cycle is popular with the target ""young adult"" demographic but lacks the eye-popping sales numbers of either J.K. Rowling or Stephanie Meyer. Nevertheless taken at face value The Hunger Games represents the best first book adaptation of any of the three series. It surpasses Christopher Columbus Harry Potter and the Sorcerers/Philosophers Stone by a whisker and Catherine Hardwickes Twilight by considerably more than that. The Hunger Games is fast-paced slickly plotted and (as with the best science fiction) addresses substantive issues in the subtext. The story contains some cheats and many of the plot elements are borrowed from other sources but the end result is engrossing. Fans will be delighted. Non-fans should give this movie a chance. The Hunger Games belongs to the post-apocalyptic genre with events taking place at an unspecified future date. At some point North America became known as Panem - a nation divided into 13 districts surrounding a powerful central Capitol. 75 years before the start of the movie the districts rebelled against the Capitol but the rebellion was crushed. District 13 was destroyed and as part of the peace settlement the other twelve districts were forced to participate in ""The Hunger Games."" Once per year a lottery is held and two ""tributes"" (one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 18) are sent from each district to a battle-to-the-death gladiatorial struggle that is the biggest televised event across all of Panem. After 23 deaths the lone survivor is declared the champion. For the 74th annual Hunger Games 12-year old Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is chosen as the female tribute from District 12. To save her sister from almost certain death 16-year old Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take Primroses place. She is accompanied on the journey to the Capitol by her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Once there she trains with Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) a bitter drunk who won the games more than 20 years earlier. She receives moral support and image advice from Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Cinna (Lennie Kravitz). Her boldness and showmanship make her an immediate popular favorite - something that angers President Snow (Donald Sutherland) while delighting the games organizer (Wes Bentley) and the on-air commentator (Stanley Tucci). When the games begin Katniss uses Haymitchs advice to survive the opening ""bloodbath"" then pretends to share a romance with Peeta to enhance her image. In the end however she develops genuine feelings for him which become a potential problem since in order for her to win he must die. The Hunger Games mines a wealth of prior sources varying from Greek mythology (Theseus) and Roman history (gladiators) to the Doctor Who 1985 story ""Vengeance on Varos"" (broadcasting of violent contests to pacify the masses) and the Star Trek episode ""Amok Time"" (best friends fighting to the death). Its closest cousin might well be The Running Man. Its Survivor for the bloodthirsty crowd with alliances and eliminations but there are no immunity idols or tribal councils. And the end is more permanent than merely being voted off the island. The Hunger Games is darkly critical of the publics embrace of the violent side of ""reality"" shows and paints an ugly portrait of human fascination with celebrating the suffering and death of others. The Capitol uses The Hunger Games like a drug to distract the populace from the grimness of everyday life. The popularity of The Hunger Games with girls is explained by the first-person perspective of a strong female character. (This also helps to explain the otherwise inexplicable popularity of Twilight but it doesnt extend to Harry Potter.) Katniss is a compelling relatable individual who as a result of a superlative performance by Jennifer Lawrence immediately connects with the audience. Lawrence with her blonde tresses dyed dark is the key to the movie working as well as it does. She crafts a character worth rooting for and is easily The Hunger Games acting standout. Lawrences same age co-star is Josh Hutcherson whose resume includes such diverse fare as The Kids are All Right and Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant. He doesnt rivet the camera with Lawrences intensity but theres a puppy dog likeability to him that captures our affection. In what amounts to a role reversal hes a capable damsel in distress to Lawrences heroic knight errant. The secondary cast is populated by familiar names Woody Harrelson Elizabeth Banks Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland. The Hunger Games has a long way to go however to match Harry Potter for density of high-profile actors. Director Gary Ross is known for choosing his projects carefully. This is only his third directorial outing in 15 years (following Pleasantville and Sea Biscuit). In The Hunger Games he shows too much fondness for the shaky-cam approach to action scenes although there is method to his madness. By rendering the most violent sequences incomprehensible he dilutes their impact. One could make a compelling case that The Hunger Games is bloody enough to deserve an R but Ross stylistic approach limits the disturbing aspects sufficiently to slide the movie under the PG-13 limbo bar. The Hunger Games is an able adaptation of its source material although of necessity much of the backstory has been condensed or removed. Viewers are provided sufficient flavor to hint at greater complexity. The lions work of the scripting was done by the books author Suzanne Collins. Unlike J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyer she took an active role in shaping how the cinematic version of her world looks and feels. A couple dubious attempts are made at creating pop cultural touchstones. The oft-repeated refrain of ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" lacks the simple elegance of ""May the Force be with you."" And theres a four-note ""theme"" that is vaguely reminiscent of the five-note signature from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. There are times when The Hunger Games takes the easy way out rather than forcing the heroine to face painful moral choices. These instances are forgivable because they along with the admittedly generic love story lighten a potentially grim tone. The Hunger Games is effective in generating suspense. We recognize that Katniss is going to survive (other than George R.R. Martin few authors are comfortable offing their main character) but the tension comes from learning how. Fully half the movies long 140-minute running time is spent in the games so were not cheated of the experience of seeing how the competition develops. A case has been made that the book The Hunger Games bears more than a passing resemblance to the 1999 novel Battle Royale but regardless of the degree to which Collins did or did not borrow from that source The Hunger Games has an identity of its own. Though its most bold cultural statements (the pervasive influence of violence as entertainment and the Big Brother power of a totalitarian government in a technological era) are derivative the fact that a property aimed at ""young adults"" would make them at all is somewhat remarkable. A determination has not yet been made whether the other two chapters of The Hunger Games trilogy will be filmed - that will depend largely upon the movies box office performance (which at least as of this writing looks to be impressive). The film does not demand a sequel - the story is self-contained and although there are ""hooks"" that could connect this to another installment The Hunger Games can exist comfortably in a vacuum. It should not be lumped into the same category as Twilight. Such a connection is vaguely insulting since The Hunger Games is unquestionably superior. This is sophisticated entertainment with a broad-based appeal.

"The Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence dazzles |       NJ.com comments The Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence dazzles Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 20 2012 at 730 AM updated March 20 2012 at 550 PM View/Post Comments Murray Close/MCTJennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. It is a young-adult fantasy trilogy that has sold millions of copies. It has a teen heroine a torn-between-two-boys subplot and plenty of gruesome action. And it has a hungry studio attached (which is of course already talking about milking the profits even further by splitting Book Three into Films III and IV). But this is not your older sisters ""Twilight."" This is ""The Hunger Games"" the sci-fi story of a world in which an impossibly rich and decadent central government has brought a dozen rebellious regions into line. And forces them each to pay annual human tribute in the form of two teens fated to fight to the death while their betters (and bettors) watch and cheer. And as in every other fan-based project there are only two questions How will the people who already love the original material react to this adaptation? And what will people who dont know the original material at all think of this epic? And the answer to both is -- probably a little mixed. Although Suzanne Collins books got suspicious looks from adult critics -- the teens-vs.-teens competition felt like a direct steal from the controversial novel (and Takeshi Kitano thriller) ""Battle Royale"" -- it had the feel of classic myth a terrific heroine and a setting in a world both eerily strange and painfully familiar. But while the new film has been faithful to that heroine its been forced to create other concrete details for things the author only alluded to and had left up to readers to fill in -- and rarely is the filmmakers imagination as good as ours was. Yes we still have Katniss Everdeen the 16-year-old who volunteers to take her baby sisters place in the fight-to-the-death Hunger Games. She was a terrific female character in any novel but particularly so in the world of young adult fiction - capable resourceful independent. And Jennifer Lawrence -- no cookie-cutter cliche herself -- is a perfect choice. Its not just her serious athleticism (she actually looks like she could shoot the eye out of a squirrel). Its the ability she has to access complicated even somewhat formless emotions -- that mad mix of adult determination and adolescent awkwardness. We understand her conflicted feelings about stay-at-home beau Liam Hemsworth and fellow contestant Josh Hutcherson (although both actors could be stronger). And we empathize with her poor-kid bravado and social awkwardness. Lawrence carries the whole movie on her shoulders. Its where the filmmakers have to go into other characters -- and other details -- that the film sometimes falters. Collins book started with a strong situation and then pulled you along with incident dialogue and its first-person point-of-view -- there wasnt a lot of description and we remained inside Katniss head throughout. But the script now cuts between the Hunger Games themselves and the functionaries running it breaking that laser-like focus. And forced to finally show us what Collins mostly left to our imaginations it often falters. For example readers knew that District 12 was impoverished - but who thought it would look like a perfectly preserved 1920s Appalachia? And while we understood the ruling class was vain and flashy now that we see them up-close they look simply absurd a laughable mixture of high camp and tacky taste. This isnt the Capitol of the book; its some hacks reimagining of Oz an Emerald City gone wild. The supporting performances are similarly jumbled. Lenny Kravitz for example is a sensitive and appealing Cinna; Woody Harrelson is a colorful Haymitch. But an unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks is only a one-dimensional annoyance as Effie and as Seneca Wes Bentley should be thrown to the mutts if only for his ridiculous facial hair. Although to be fair -- and this gets forgotten -- this is entertainment designed for young teens. It is not a work meant to provide complex and sympathetic adult characters (in fact most teen books are designed to provide the opposite). And to the films credit once were in the midst of the Games themselves -- about halfway through the nearly two-and-a-half hour movie -- the high-stakes of the plot and the empathetic power of Lawrence are able to wipe most of these problems away. Unlike the first episodes of many franchises the film also delivers a satisfying conclusion while still promising more intrigue to come. But will audiences want more? True Katniss is a great character and has real female appeal. Unlike the sullen dithering Bella of ""Twilight"" shes a capable and determined young woman who can take care of herself and is determined to plot her own future. She may be 16 but shes the only real grown-up here. Yet as this first episode stands shes also pretty much the only real attraction. There are of course more films planned but so far the movie franchise doesnt deliver the fantastic imagery and moral parables of the ""Harry Potter"" series (or even the sexual power and cultural subtext of the ""Twilight"" saga). Director Gary Ross is visually impoverished and the too-blatant overemphasis on satirizing reality TV only distracts from the books other far more interesting themes. Will the next films rise to that challenge and dare to push themselves -- and the edge -- a little further? Its something the filmmakers will have to risk if theyre going to do justice to the books and their fans -- but its also a huge gamble. May the odds be ever in their favor.

"The Hunger Games (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hunger Games (PG-13) Big on hype but short on thrills this eagerly-awaited adaptation of the Suzanne Collins novel plays too safe. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/20/2012 Editor rating 2 Was it wrong to expect something more from The Hunger Games other than pajama-party fodder? Suzanne Collins dystopian sci-fi novel - the first in a trilogy - was rife with potential for a bold daring entertainment that blended dark satire and social commentary with big action beats and thrills. Instead what director Gary Ross opted for is an earnest plodding thumb-sucker - a sugar-coated pacifier to appease the screaming hordes. This is a science-fiction movie of the blandest most generic order technically adequate but devoid of any wit or insight or anything more substantial and lasting than the cool image of Jennifer Lawrence wielding a wicked bow and arrow. In The Hunger Games Lawrence is essentially reprising her Oscar-nominated role from Winters Bone An adolescent girl tasked with providing for her family by whatever means necessary. She plays Katniss a 16 year-old drafted into an annual competition in which teenagers from different social and economic strata are forced to fight to the death. The government-sponsored contest which is watched on live TV by millions is used by the tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to keep the masses in check. The screenplay written by Ross and Collins and Billy Ray (Shattered Glass) replaces the novels first-person narration by Katniss with banal observations about sheep-herd mentality and the vacuous news media and our cultural obsession with celebrity and the perils of reality television and blind American Idol worship. Doesnt this all sound awfully tired? Hasnt this field been tilled enough? With nothing to engage the mind The Hunger Games aims for the heart. Katniss tentative romance with a fellow contestant Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is surprisingly sweet and touching - he and Lawrence share all of the films best moments - but theres something rote and programmed about it too. You never question whether things will work out for them because this is an overly timid movie about a wild and outrageous concept. Theres no sense of danger or menace in The Hunger Games which is a big problem for a movie that should feel like any of its characters could die at any given moment. The most exciting scene in the entire film involves the sawing of a tree branch. By the time the CGI monsters showed up I was actively longing for the ""Game Over"" sign. In fact the most entertaining part of The Hunger Games is the first half before the games begin while Katniss and Peeta are being coached by a former winner (Woody Harrelson) or given fashion advice by an image consultant (Lenny Kravitz) or interviewed by an obsequious Piers Morgan-type (Stanley Tucci). The actors do a lot with their small roles briefly cutting through the movies off-putting vision of the future (think The Fifth Element only gaudier). Their performances are the only things in the film that dont feel processed and sterilized and safe. With this cautiously violent parable Ross is so mindful of not upsetting his target audience (or earning the wrath of their parents) that he ends up patronizing them instead This is the mildest shallowest variation on The Most Dangerous Game ever filmed with the worst closing shot ever to grace the first installment in an intended franchise. But the ultimate failure of The Hunger Games as a movie is not its derivative nature or its chintzy production design or even its lack of one single memorable set piece. The films biggest flaw is the complete absence of vision or imagination - anything that would justify the movies existence as something other than a way to cash in on the novel. The Harry Potter pictures brought visual wonder to J.K. Rowlings intricate fantasy world. The Twilight series has been a smash because of the chemistry between its lead actors. The Hunger Games though offers nothing. If youve read the book you should know that in the film the leg heals. If you havent read the book opt instead for Battle Royale the controversial Japanese movie made in 2000 that has a near-identical premise and is (not coincidentally) being released on DVD for the first time in the U.S. this week. That movie takes no prisoners The Hunger Games takes no risks.

Not much digging is required to find plot elements from ""The 10th Victim"" ""Battle Royale"" ""The Truman Show"" ""Lord of the Flies"" ""The Running Man"" and ""Series 7 The Contenders"" alongside design ideas from ""A Clockwork Orange"" and even the infamously ridiculous ""The Apple."" Its easy to forgive this kind of thievery however when the perp actually does something with the stolen goods and for whatever ""The Hunger Games"" lacks in originality it makes up for with verve and relentless forward motion. Like the reality shows it comments upon the movie dazzles you with its bravado and moves fast enough to keep you from asking too many questions about its implausibility. As almost any teenager or YA-reading adult can tell you ""The Hunger Games"" is set in a future dystopia where the central government punishes the populace for an uprising generations earlier by forcing each of 12 districts to supply a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in a televised competition in which the last person standing wins. Also read Hunger Games Album Review NPR-ish Teen Angst From Taylor Swift Maroon 5 Arcade Fire In the Appalachia-like coal-mining District 12 12-year-old Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) gets called up in her first year of eligibility but to save her life Prims sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to go in her place in an unprecedented act of courage. Katniss and her fellow tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are whisked off to the capitol city to train for the games. As a skilled hunter proficient with a bow and arrow Katniss enters the competition with an impressive skill set. But its Peeta who figures out that PR plays an equally large role in who lives and who dies so he immediately starts playing to the crowd and eventually declares his secret love for Katniss on TV. (Its not unlike those ""American Idol"" kids who use hard-luck stories about sickness or dead relatives to get more camera time during the auditions.) Also read Hunger Games Beats Twilight Saga Eclipse in First-Day Advance Sales After Katniss and Peeta train under the tutelage of former Games winner Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) theyre finally sent off into the wilderness to compete. The kids from Districts 1 and 2 have trained their entire lives for this event but the resourcefulness of the more impoverished children -- including young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) from District 11 -- make it a fairer fight even with Games master Seneca (Wes Bentley) creating fire manipulating the rise and fall of the sun and even summoning deadly dog-beasts out of thin air from his control room. Non-readers of Suzanne Collins series of bestsellers will see the appeal of the books since the plot is packed with incident charging forward with the adrenaline of an old-school cliffhanger serial. Those same viewers may themselves a little confused over details. For instance theres a lot of talk about the importance of having sponsors to survive the Games even though here the sponsors wind up not impacting the Games at all -- but the screen adaptation (by director Gary Ross with Collins and Billy Ray) generally keeps everything zipping along tying up plot issues when it needs to and laying groundwork for the inevitable sequels. Theres a certain inescapable predictability to ""The Hunger Games"" particularly when it becomes well established that Katniss is only going to kill in self-defense (and even then shes not going to take out any characters for whom we might have even a smidgen of sympathy). But even that -- as well as the knowledge that shes got three more installments to survive for -- doesnt take away too much from Ross portrayal of the deadly competition. Cinematographer Tom Stern a frequent collaborator of Clint Eastwoods gives each corner of this world a distinctive look; District 12 calls to mind the Depression-era photos of Dorothea Lange (and the railyard ""reaping"" ceremony where the districts tributes are chosen at random has a real Final Solution feel to it) whereas the gleaming decadent capitol city is all slickness and shiny surfaces. Since the movie is far more interested in plot than in character the performances here tend to be perfectly fine if nothing spectacular. Lawrence certainly conveys Katniss sheer will and determination making her a far more compelling female lead than the movies usually give us. Stanley Tucci (as a popular TV host) and Elizabeth Banks are clearly having a ball camping it up in outrageous costumes and makeup and Donald Sutherland occasionally injects some much-needed gravitas as the president who worries that Katniss popularity might rile up the masses. No ones going to mistake ""The Hunger Games"" for high art but as an action movie with a dash of ""A Tweens First Satire of Media and Class Exploitation"" its a thoroughly serviceable popcorn movie.

"Hunger Games movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Hunger Games adaptation hits the target  Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The hypocrisy at the heart of ""The Hunger Games"" is irresistible. Novelist Suzanne Collins whose trilogy has been decreed ""awesome"" by among others my 5th grade son indicts violence and organized brutality as tools of mass-audience manipulation. Yet ""The Hunger Games"" wouldnt have gotten very far without its steady supply of threatened or actual gladiatorial teen-on-teen bloodshed death by arrow javelin genetically engineered wasp plus knives. And land mines. And fearsome dogs conjured by the dogs of the totalitarian state. In hypocrisy however one can find some pretty sharp entertainment. ""The Hunger Games"" was made for the screen and for franchise glory. Ive read only the first of the three books (scheduled to be turned into four films) but Collins first book all pace and incident cries out ""Film me Film me"" on every dread-filled straighter-than-straightforward page. Director and co-adapter Gary Ross whose two previous features were the comic fantasy ""Pleasantville"" (1998) and the rosy Depression-era underhorse saga ""Seabiscuit"" (2003) turned out to be a smart match for the material. He does not pump the action for cheap thrills or opportunities to stoke the audiences blood lust. Even the score by James Newton Howard reminding us subtly that the key characters come from the land formerly known as Appalachia shows a kind of mournful restraint in framing the action. The movie earns its PG-13 rating. But it earns it honestly. The killings in ""The Hunger Games"" mean something in emotional terms and are meant to have a cumulative emotional effect on the crafty stoical heroine Katniss Everdeen played by Jennifer Lawrence. The young actress received an Oscar nomination for her work in ""Winters Bone"" and her performance here is no less fierce and purposeful. Id say she carries the movie except shes not the only good thing about it. Time a century or so from now. North America is now called Panem. The nation is ruled by an elegant despot played by Donald Sutherland which means stock in sinister line readings is at an all-time high. In the lands 12 remaining and miserably neglected districts life among the starving 99-percenters is harsh enough to make""Metropolis"" look like a staycation. As part of totalitarian rule bread and circuses division two children from each district between the ages of 12 and 18 (prime age range for Young Adult literature) must compete each year as ""tributes"" to the death in the annual Hunger Games. The games are televised. Akin to ""The Truman Show"" the games designer (Wes Bentley) contrives to keep things hopping inside the near-limitless confines of a massive topographically diverse arena. Viewing of the games is mandatory throughout Panem. The play-by-play color commentary comes from a couple of weaselly Restoration-era foplike characters played by Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones. (Nothing in ""The Hunger Games"" is more frightening than Tuccis smile.) Volunteering her services when her younger sister is picked for the games Katniss represents District 12 along with a bakers son Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Whisked to the Capitol by superfast train these two train together under the boozy tutelage of Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who along with the frilly Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) coaches the teenagers in the value of gaining sponsors and of pulling a viewing audiences strings. ""The Hunger Games"" compiles so many teen fantasies and nightmares its hard to keep track of them all. The burden of sudden unwanted celebrity collides with the difficulty as we know from the ""Twilight"" films of a young woman torn between two fellers in this case Peeta and the village hunk back in District 12 Katniss hunting companion Gale played by Liam Hemsworth. In the ""Twilight"" franchise the heroine carved out plenty of time to mope and brood en route to the most fraught sexual initiation imaginable. ""The Hunger Games"" has other things on its mind namely raw survival in the vein of ""The Most Dangerous Game."" When Chris Columbus filmed the first ""Harry Potter"" book his job was to get the big ball rolling and shoe-horn in a decent percentage of J.K. Rowlings wealth of detail. With ""The Hunger Games"" the task was different; Ross and his fellow adapters Collins and Billy Ray really didnt have a whole lot to cut. When I heard the film was nearly two and a half hours long I thought Is there really a two-and-a-half-hour movie in that book? But there is. The film feels dramatically substantial but not inflated. A lot of it -- the core of it really -- puts us on the ground running in the woods with Katniss without much in the way of digital effects. Ross shoots far too much in hand-held close-ups. (It works for the violence but less well for simple dialogue sequences.) The editing rhythm often pushes the film past urgency and into chaos. But theres a human pulse to this blockbuster in the making. Lawrence has a face born for the movies. Its not standard-issue praise be. She doesnt grab the screen like a performer whose mission is to become a movie star. Rather she acts. Naturally. The games have begun and so far theyre pretty gripping. mjphillipstribune.comThe Hunger Games -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images -- all involving teens)Running time 222Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment The Hunger Games Literature Arts and Culture PG-13 Rated Movies Toby Jones Qamp;A The Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson 10 best movies of 2011 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0320-hunger-games-20120321,0,6123575.column",200,thehungergames36,thehungergames,chicagotribune

The savagery is a yearly ritual mandated by the tyrannical regime of Panem a broken nation built after a terrible war on the futuristic ruins of North America. Its also broadcast on live TV a national media event. This horrific vision of a near future in which teenagers are in peril is sickening but the individual heroism of some who fight is also thrilling as millions of readers can attest Suzanne Collins Hunger Games trilogy is a literary sensation. The good news now coming out of Panem both for those who already know just how brutal the Games become and those who are new to the dystopian tale is that the movie adaptation knows how to play too. This Hunger Games is a muscular honorable unflinching translation of Collins vision. Its brutal where it needs to be particularly when children fight and bleed. It conveys both the miseries of the oppressed represented by the poorly fed and clothed citizens of Panems 12 suffering districts and the rotted values of the oppressors evident in the gaudy decadence of those who live in the Capitol. Best of all the movie effectively showcases the allure of the storys remarkable kick-ass 16-year-old heroine Katniss Everdeen. Katniss -- who volunteers to fight in place of her sister as one of District 12s two unfortunate ""tributes"" when the little girl is chosen -- is the heart and soul of the story one of those feisty female protagonists pitched to the YA market but appealing to adults as well. Katniss is happiest when shes hunting food for her family with the bow-and-arrow precision that is her specialty. Shes a tomboy with a trademark brunet braid down her back and shes a graceful young woman -- strong self-possessed and unaware of her own beauty whether dressed like a backwoods scout or dolled up for pageant display in gorgeous gowns. And Jennifer Lawrence previously dressed as a backwoods scout in her galvanizing breakout Winters Bone is in her gravity her intensity and her own unmannered beauty about as impressive a Hollywood incarnation of Katniss as one could ever imagine. Much of Katniss experience throughout the Games -- as she improvises with an ingenuity far beyond the scope of any TV Survivor contestant -- is interior silent. Lawrence is expressive in her stillness and moves with athletic confidence. Fans of the book and moviegoers coming to the story fresh may reach different conclusions about the effectiveness of Josh Hutcherson as Peeta the bakers son from District 12 who is at once Katniss competitor and the boy who loves her. In the book interesting edges rough up his niceness; hes not quite so easy to peg. But to these eyes on screen hes been sanded down to a generic sensitive good guy so much so that its difficult to understand why Katniss is prickly around him. Meanwhile so little is seen of Liam Hemsworth as Gale Katniss soul mate/fellow hunter in this first episode that the uninitiated might not pay attention to the third angle of the storys romantic triangle -- about the only element this high-quality pop culture phenomenon has in common with the swoons of Twilight. Director Gary Ross does a tight job of establishing the future-meets-1984 vibe in Panem the slog of daily life the hopelessness that dulls the citizens the fear that returns each year at the Hunger Games lottery known as the Reaping. Aided by outre costumes from designer Judianna Makovsky he also goes to town in the Capitol sequences. Elizabeth Banks as Effie the PR handler Woody Harrelson as Haymitch the mentor Lenny Kravitz as Cinna the stylist Stanley Tucci as Caesar the unctuous TV interviewer -- theyre all reasonable facsimiles of whats on the page and fabulous oddities for those who are just meeting them. And if the depiction of the death-by-death progress of the Games themselves as Katniss struggles mightily to save her own life on behalf of her sister doesnt match the psychological tension on the page well thems may be the rules of the adaptation game. The movie shows how but the book shows why.

The Hunger Games Fair to good Director Gary Ross. Cast Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth. Rating PG-13 for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images all involving teens. This weeks new movie releases The Hunger Games Thats worth keeping in mind as you watch ""The Hunger Games"" especially if you adore the Suzanne Collins novel on which its based. Millions of people do and like the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" films that popularity assures a fanaticism for the movie before a single frame shows up on the screen. Hewing closely to the plot of the first book it also assures fervor among fans. Hunger Games is the Next Big Thing Qamp;A Gary Ross | Liam Hemsworth Jennifer Lawrence | Josh Hutcherson 3/21 Party at Bamp;N | Meet the cast Thats understandable because those are the people likely to enjoy it most. Yet while Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Katniss Everdeen the heroine of the series too much of the rest of the film is merely serviceable. If you read the book youll probably find connecting the dots of the story and the characters interactions a little easier. If you havent well there might be times you wonder whats going on. When theyre playing the game itself the film is exciting and well-executed by director Gary Ross. But the scenes involving the Capitol -- the ones without Lawrence or Woody Harrelson in them though they are thankfully few -- are less effective. Some are campy some silly. Whether this will disappoint those devoted to the novel is anyones guess but its not great filmmaking. The film like the novel is set in the near-future in a war-scarred North America now called Panem. Its been parceled into 12 districts; Katniss lives in District 12 the poorest of them and must provide for her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson) in the absence of her father. She and her friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) spend time hunting wondering about the world they live in. For Katniss at least its about to change. Every year the districts conduct a ""reaping"" among teenagers in which a boy and girl from each district are chosen for the Hunger Games a combination fight to the death and reality show. There is some murky nonsense intoned by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) about how this maintains peace but in reality it is clearly a way for the Capitol to maintain control over the districts. A vapid Capitol representative named Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) arrives in District 12 to pull names from a bowl. To Katniss horror Primroses name is selected. Knowing its a death sentence Katniss volunteers instead. Soon she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) the boy chosen are on their way to the Capitol for training and a kind of charm school. Not to make them more attractive as Cinna (Lenny Kravitz)Katniss stylist explains but to help make an impression. Given their impoverished background Katinss and Peeta are at a disadvantage against the better-trained kids from the other districts. But Katniss shows real spunk something Haymitch Abernathy (Harrelson) a winner of a previous Hunger Games and their boozy adviser picks up on; he comes around as a genuine asset after he sees her potential. And then the game begins. We dont really meet the other contestants in a meaningful way so their slaughter doesnt move us as it might. We do get to know Rue (Amandla Stenberg) in somewhat fleeting fashion but she makes an impression mostly because she is so young an adorable little kid. The game plays out the way it plays out; youll find no spoilers here. But this is when Lawrence is at her best reminiscent of her brilliant work in ""Winters Bone"" for which she received an Oscar nomination. Hidden cameras capture every move every kill. The President and Seneca (Wes Bentley) who is in charge of the games manipulate things as best they can behind the scenes worried that Katniss success will foment rebellion by giving people too much hope. But Katniss proves to be a master manipulator as well. Ross does not. Too many connections are murky. For instance when Cinna first starts working with Katniss they are understandably distant remote. By the time the game begins hes one of her most-trusted friends and advisers. How and when did this happen? And while Ross uses camerawork to distinguish what the contestants are seeing and what the audience watching them sees we dont get a real feel for the fanaticism of the people watching at home. And some of the effects are simply ridiculous including the parade of contestants -- specifically the bit where Katniss gets her ""girl on fire"" nickname. She is supposed to look dramatic; instead she looks silly. But she never acts silly. Lawrence is a tremendous talent and she is what makes ""The Hunger Games"" ultimately worth spending time with. She doesnt elevate the film to the heights to which one might have wanted but she takes it a lot higher than it would have otherwise risen. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

A teenager fights to the death in a cruel future America. (222) Director Gary Ross. PG-13; Violence explosions hand-to-hand combat. At area theaters. Its a true shot to the heart ""The Hunger Games"" the highly anticipated movie based on the best-selling teen novel is as tough-spirited as fans would hope for -- and exciting and thought-provoking in a way few adventure dramas ever are. Its also a far more serious movie than the marketing and mainstream mania have led us to believe. RELATED THE MAKING OF THE HUNGER GAMES RELATED YOUR GUIDE TO THE WORLD OF PANEM BOOK REVIEW GREAT READ BUT NOT ALL-TIME GREAT Its better and scarier than its source book and aims an angry eye at our bloodthirsty watch-anything-and-cheer culture. And theres also pro-rebellion anti-1% sentiment coursing through its blood. While the dark allegory within Suzanne Collins 2008 publishing phenomenon remains intact its anchored by a remarkable performance from Jennifer Lawrence and -- it has to be said -- cant-look-away action. Lawrence as everyone now knows plays Katniss Everdeen a 16-year-old in a future North America reconfigured after war and eco-disaster into ""Panem."" A dozen impoverished ""districts"" controlled by the amoral Capitol make up the ex-U.S. Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games."" (Murray Close/AP) Katniss family lives in District 12 formerly Appalachia. She and her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) hunt for squirrels to survive -- her preferred weapon is a bow and arrow -- while hoping not to hear their names called in the Hunger Games in which a young girl and boy from each district are picked by lottery for an annual televised death match -- killing each other for the amusement of the wealthy and powerful. The Games are a way of punishing constituents for a nearly century-old uprising though haunting propaganda films paint them as honorable sacrifice. When her little sister is chosen Katniss volunteers to take her place. Her co-""tribute"" is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) a bakers son from Katniss starving town. After Peeta and Katniss are fawned over by the Capitols craven citizenry theyre transported via hovercraft to a woodland arena where Katniss archery skills and survival instincts could save her -- as could the audiences belief that she and Peeta are in love. But there are 22 other young people out there willing to murder to win hoping ""a good show"" will earn them life. Director Gary Ross whose ""Pleasantville"" is spiritual kin to this movie may seem too grown-up for the material but hes a smart chaperone. He allows for historical context -- children registering to be slaughtered evokes a concentration camp -- but doesnt glamorize the horror of kids killing kids and isnt shy about dramatizing how a government can abuse and manipulate the poor. Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games."" And he doesnt push Lawrence a past Oscar nominee to be anything other than her wily self. She gives a soulful stern performance that never dips into Bella-Swan levels of pandering. An affecting Hutcherson and Hemsworth may match Lawrences ferocity with occasionally obvious earnestness but they give ""Games"" -- and its future sequels-- a feistier triangle than the ""Twilight"" films. Meanwhile a great supporting cast -- toothy Stanley Tucci as a horrific TV host Donald Sutherland as a malevolent President and perfectly cast Woody Harrelson as drunken former Games victor Haymitch Abernathy -- indulges in modulated scenery-chewing. It should be said that even the books fans may be shocked at the movies toughness as well as its tone which feels like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Logans Run"" woven with the DNA of TVs ""Survivor."" But for all the medias salivating ""Hunger Games"" delivers -- and leaves a memorable aftertaste. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Mar. 20 2012 600AM EDT Last updated Thursday Nov. 21 2013 535PM EST Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English For once dont be put off by the hype the book may be written for young adults but the movie is a thoroughly mature affair. Thats the marvel of The Hunger Games a film that transforms a popular work of teen fiction not just by faithfully exploring its themes but more important by proving those themes have a very grown-up resonance. Compare that to the Harry Potter or Twilight pictures which however well adapted always betray their juvenile origins - entertainingly juvenile at best yet still kids stuff in an infantilized culture. But this is something different and darker - its kids stuff that speaks to and ominously dissects that culture; its Lord of the Flies updated for the electronic age. Liam Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson and Alexander Ludwig walked the red carpet at a splashy premiere for The Hunger Games in Toronto Monday. Hutcherson told reporters hes a lot like Peeta the character he plays in the film.

MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS video Video Hunger Games star on rabid fans Cast member Jennifer Lawrence poses at the premiere of ""The Hunger Games"" at Nokia theatre in Los Angeles California March 12 2012. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters Movies Video Is Hunger Games too violent? Wisely unwilling to step aside Suzanne Collins the writer of The Hunger Games plus the two books that complete the trilogy has taken a hand in the screenplay along with director Gary Ross who wastes no time sinking the hook. Cut quickly but pointedly the early frames lay out the richest part of the novel its dystopian premise. In a future North America ravaged by ecological change warfare and a disappeared middle class the nation of Panem is barbarously divided into the haves and the have-nots - the rich ruling regime in the Capitol and their subjects in a dozen outlying districts beset by varying degrees of deprivation. Each year brings a ""Public Reaping"" wherein the young from the provinces are grimly harvested for the annual Hunger Games - a gladiatorial spectacle which has a boy and girl ranging in age from 12 to 18 selected by lottery from each district to compete in a televised ""fight to the death"". The deadly ritual is promoted by the rulers as a surrogate for war a catharsis that doubles as a circus that sees hope vying with fear and the callow victims heralded as fallen heroes making the ultimate sacrifice in the name of peace.Already you can see the cleverness in the conceit. Simultaneously retro and futuristic the script borrows as liberally from Roman epics and medieval lore as it does from reality TV and apocalyptic sci-fi. Engaging too are the set designs which vividly supply the contrast between plenty and poverty - the pampered luxury the neo-fascist architecture the decadent fashions of the Capitol where the big wigs literally wear big wigs of imperial purple; versus the poverty the near-starvation the grinding misery of the Appalachian miners in District 12 where the lottery ball is poised for the Reaping. There children are lined up at the train tracks for selection (the echo of other children selected for other trains is deliberate). When blind chance settles on her terrified little sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers in her stead. The young warrior is transported to her fate as the ubiquitous camera looks on and the smarmy TV host (a gloriously wiggy Stanley Tucci) cheerfully warbles the mantra du jour ""Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favour"".When the setting shifts to the affluence of the Capitol two threads quickly emerge. The first is a narrative addition furthering the premise. The young contestants called ""tributes"" are gussied up in designer uniforms paraded in an opening ceremony that combines the prettiness of the Oscars with the pomp of the Olympics and subjected to rigorous basic training by the survivors of previous Games (Woody Harrelson among them). Also the reality TV component gets amped up. The shows producers and their masters the sponsors are on the lookout for telegenic tributes and for cute story angles guaranteed to boost ratings. When Katnisss fellow draftee Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) confesses to having a crush on her the news is greeted with joy by the media hounds ""I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12"".Thats when the second thread appears. Purely thematic this one drags the retro and futuristic elements smack into the present day. Suddenly the metaphor hits home with the stark realization that the entertainment were watching here is alarmingly similar to the ""entertainment"" weve watched too often before. A wealthy nation recruits its warriors from the ranks of the impoverished young dresses them up in uniforms packs them off to wage war against the impoverished young of other nations. The media and their sponsors rush to televise the conflict pointing cameras in eager pursuit of bigger audiences and swollen coffers. Individual soldiers are sought out for their human interest value and when the bloody circus turns tragic the callow victims are heralded as fallen heroes making the ultimate sacrifice in the name of peace.At this point the kids stuff fiction collides with the kids stuff fact and adults are obliged to ponder the real world we have wrought a world where adolescents do indeed fight wars while their elders do indeed watch with profitable interest. The penny drops Panems reality TV is our televised reality - the future is now.Consequently as the long (too long) third act plays out on the killing fields the sight of children slaying children should give us pause. So should the attendant sight of TV producers manipulating the coverage to heighten viewer satisfaction especially the love-angle between Katniss and Peeta. Of course that same love-angle helps to power this movie which shrewdly capitalizes on precisely what it satirizes - a delightful bit of meta-fiction. Alas the ending feels abrupt and loose perhaps inevitably given the sequel to come. Nevertheless en route to the climax Ross handles the action deftly and without the usual clamour even pushing the mute button on one exceptional occasion. And Lawrence tapping into the abundant talent she displayed in Winters Bone nicely paints both the teenage warrior and every teens inner war the ongoing battle between strength and vulnerability.But this isnt an actors film any more than its just a kids film. Instead The Hunger Games is a modern allegory that illuminates what it appears to imitate throwing our light/bright culture into darker relief.

The first novel in Suzanne Collins bestselling trilogy is a futuristic fight-to-the-death thriller driven by pure survival instinct but the creative equivalent of that go-for-broke impulse is absent from director Gary Ross ""The Hunger Games."" Proficient involving ever faithful to its source and centered around Jennifer Lawrences impressive star turn this much-anticipated nearly 2 1/2-hour event picture should satiate fans entertain the uninitiated and take an early lead among the years top-grossing films. Yet in the face of near-certain commercial success no one seems to have taken the artistic gambles that might have made this respectable adaptation a remarkable one. Relentlessly paced unflagging in its sense of peril and blessed with a spunky protagonist who can hold her own alongside Bella Swan and Lisbeth Salander in the pantheon of pop-lit heroines Collins latest book cycle seemed a logical candidate for adaptation from the get-go. Narrated in a first-person style that favors swift exposition over descriptive detail the series also offers a filmmaker plenty of leeway not only in visualizing its dystopian world onscreen but in tackling the real-world parallels implicit in this grim vision of totalitarian rule. Bookended by scenes set in a high-tech city the film quickly immerses the viewer in the mud and grime of District 12 the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the futuristic nation of Panem. The government maintains order through nationally televised bloodsports known as the Hunger Games in which two ""tributes"" from each district a boy and a girl must participate in an annual winner-kills-all-and-takes-all bloodbath. Pluckier and more resourceful than most is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) a skilled archer who hunts to provide for herself her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields). When Prim is selected at random to represent District 12 in the games Katniss bravely volunteers to take her place and winds up paired with bakers son Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) with whom she shares a brief vague history. Accompanied by some leaden comic relief in the form of a drunken mentor (Woody Harrelson) and a garishly made-up escort (Elizabeth Banks) the two are whisked off to the Capitol an ivory tower of a city imagined as a fantastical explosion of color by production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky among others. There all 24 tributes are made over trained for battle and interviewed by a beaming blue-haired celebrity host (Stanley Tucci) as a prelude to this lethal mash-up of ""Survivor"" ""American Idol"" and at one point ""Project Runway."" The questions raised here regarding the morality of violence as entertainment and the brutality of pitting children against each other have been addressed before and to more potent effect in films like ""Series 7 The Contenders"" and the shockingly violent Japanese actioner ""Battle Royale."" Yet if the satirical and topical elements arent exactly fresh the script (by Ross Collins and Billy Ray) does give them a few knowing spins. Particularly shrewd are the behind-the-scenes moments when Panems President Snow (a quietly malevolent Donald Sutherland) pressures Seneca (Wes Bentley) the keeper of the games to maintain control of the situation a subplot that reps one of the few deviations from the novel and lays the groundwork for ""Catching Fire"" the next film in the Lionsgate series. But once the games begin and the contenders are released into a densely forested arena rigged with ""Truman Show""-style cameras for maximum coverage and trackability the film clings to Collins text as if it were itself a survival guide. Readers may find themselves mentally checking off plot points as Katniss looks for water; flees fires; makes strategic use of a wasps nest; tries to suss out whether Peeta loves her wants to kill her or both; and uses her many years of hunting experience to evade outwit and inevitably destroy her attackers. Whatever its earlier shortcomings the picture really should have spread its wings at this stage morphing into a spare stripped-down actioner fueled by sheer adrenaline and nonstop harrowing incident. That intention is evident enough in the darting handheld camerawork and quick cutting style favored here by the filmmakers including d.p. Tom Stern and editors Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling. Yet while the individual setpieces are well staged they also feel a bit too neatly scheduled within the storys framework and the frequent toggling between the arena and Senecas control room only undercuts the momentum. Lawrence who auditioned brilliantly for this role with her even rawer turn in ""Winters Bone"" again projects a heartrending combo of vulnerability grit and soul while convincingly playing several years her junior. The camera remains so glued to her every expression and gesture that no one else save perhaps Lenny Kravitz as Katniss suave professional stylist is given the opportunity to hold the screen against her. The film does achieve a strong surge of emotion when Katniss forms an alliance with young tribute Rue (winning newcomer Amandla Stenberg) culminating in a stirring sequence that pauses to acknowledge the sheer impossible inhumanity of the situation. Yet after this high point things settle into a more prosaic anticlimactic rhythm and the central drama pivoting on the nature of Katniss and Peetas relationship never sparks to life. What viewers are left with is a watchable enough picture that feels content to realize someone elses vision rather than claim it as its own. Any real sense of risk has been carefully ironed out The PG-13 rating that ensures the films suitability for its target audience also blunts the impact of the teen-on-teen bloodshed most of it rendered in quick oblique glimpses; whether this is the morally responsible decision is open to debate. Weirdest of all Hunger the one constant in Katniss hard-scrabble life barely even seems to register. Ross a reliable craftsman directing his first film since 2003s ""Seabiscuit"" makes a point of delineating between the haves and have-nots While the Capitol is an overlit f/x-heavy wonderland the bleak desaturated images of rural-industrial poverty in District 12 could have been influenced by the photographs of Dorothea Lange. Given such wildly disparate parts (one scene suggests ""Little House on the Prairie"" invaded by Stormtroopers) the look doesnt entirely cohere though auds will gladly suspend disbelief. Complementing James Newton Howards orchestral score the unusually lyrical Camp;W-steeped soundtrack boasting contributions from Arcade Fire Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift nicely suggests an America mired in an uncertain future.

Daily Edition Login to download The Hunger Games Film Review 1100 PM PDT 3/15/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence is stellar in this faithful good-enough film version of the massive best-seller. TWITTER Directed by Gary Ross and based on the first in a trilogy of best-selling novels the film stars Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth as teens living in a dystopian future in which young people are forced to fight to the death on live television. The arrow hits an outer circle of the target in The Hunger Games an amply faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins monster young-adult best-seller that could have used a higher blood count in more ways than one. As she did in her breakthrough film Winters Bone Jennifer Lawrence anchors this futuristic and politicized elaboration of The Most Dangerous Game with impressive gravity and presence while director Gary Ross gets enough of what matters in the book up on the screen to satisfy its legions of fans worldwide. This Lionsgate release is being positioned as the hottest property for the teen audience since Twilight and theres no reason to believe that box office results wont land roughly in that vaunted vicinity. EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of THRs Hunger Games Cover Shoot Published in 2008 The Hunger Games marked the beginning of a trilogy rounded out by Catching Fire and Mockingjay which has in toto sold more than 26 million copies with many more to come now that the film has arrived. A giant opening weekend beginning March 23 which is all but guaranteed will no doubt trigger a green light for the second big-screen installment in the series for which the three lead actors are already set. A speculative fiction piece about a 16-year-old expert hunter who becomes one of 24 teenagers to compete in an annual televised combat spectacle from which only one will emerge alive Collins tale rips along on the page with unflagging momentum while generating legitimate suspense and a strong rooting interest in its resourceful heroine. So visually vivid are the books episodes that you can practically picture a film version while reading it meaning that it would have been foolish for any filmmaking team to veer far from the source. PHOTOS 10 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Past 25 Years With Collins on board as both a co-screenwriter and executive producer there was little chance of that so its more a matter of emphasis and cinematic elan. Ross Collins and third writer Billy Ray have stressed the fascistic political side of the story pointing up the micromanaged manipulations of the public and the games themselves while also suggesting that contemporary reality shows and televised competitions differ from this extravaganza only in their lower mortality rate. As for visual spectacle theres enough but along with it a feeling of being slightly shortchanged; the long shots of gigantic cityscapes of a fast train gliding silkily through the country of massive crowds gathered to see this years gladiators before they set off to kill one another of the decorative flames emanating from the leads costumes as the pair is presented to the public for the first time -- all are cut a bit short as if further exposure would reveal them as one notch below first-rate. On the other hand the costumes and makeup are a riot of imagination designed to evoke a level of topped-out decadence comparable to that of Neros Rome or Louis XVIs Paris. PHOTOS Hollywoods A-List Redefined Most noticeable of all however is the films lack of hunting instinct. The novel conveyed a heady sense of blood-scent of Katniss Everdeens lifetime of illegal hunting paying off in survival skills that from the outset make her the betting favorite to win the 74th edition of the Hunger Games. While present this critical element is skimmed over onscreen reducing a sense of the heroines mental calculations as well as the intensity of her physical challenges and confrontations. One senses that the filmmakers wanted to avoid showing much hunting onscreen for fear of offending certain sensibilities; stylistically one longs for the visceral expressiveness of say Walter Hill in his prime. Its also clear that the need for a PG-13 rating dictated moderation; a film accurately depicting the events of the book would certainly carry an R. That said Hunger Games has such a strong narrative structure built-in forward movement and compelling central character that it cant go far wrong. From the outset its easy to accept a future North America once decimated by war and now called Panem divided into 12 districts kept under tight control by an all-powerful central government in the stunningly modernistic Capitol. Katniss embodied by Lawrence just as one might imagine her from the novel lives in far-flung District 12 a poor mining region that can only have been Appalachia in earlier times (indeed the film was shot in North Carolina). Like all other teenagers shes annually entered in the Reaping in which a boy and girl from each district are chosen by lottery to compete in a murderous contest designed both for its political symbolism and public intoxication value. When her beloved little sisters name is shockingly called Katniss a dead shot with bow and arrow volunteers to take her place as a district Tribute alongside Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) a shy seemingly sweet kid with goo-goo eyes for Katniss. Her male model-like soulmate Gale (Liam Hemsworth) gets left behind. The remainder of the first hour details the contestants preparation for the games. This involves cleaning buffing and accoutering (rather like what happens to the visitors upon arrival in The Wizard of Oz) fight training alongside fellow combatants abundant eating tactical advice from oft-inebriated long-ago District 12 winner Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and a public interview conducted by flamboyant TV host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci ) a one-man panic so skilled at playing his guests that he gets Peeta to confess his adoration for the unsuspecting Katniss. Decked out with a balloon of backswept blue hair finished off by a giant bun Tucci has a ball with this fun character who serves to frame the brutality to come as entertainment by accentuating its personal melodramas. Once thrown into ""the arena"" a topographically varied stretch of wilderness the Tributes do whatever it takes to survive. Quite a few are butchered at the outset in the mad dash for weapons and supplies. For her part Katniss hightails it for the interior where she sleeps out of sight in trees before the ""gamemaker"" Seneca (Wes Bentley) has her flushed out by wildfire. The film goes further than the book in illustrating how omnipotent studio controllers can manipulate the action as they wish in ways they think will create better television and in the bargain please their all-powerful president (Donald Sutherland) who will countenance no sign of resistance or rebellion. PHOTOS The Hunger Games Premiere Red Carpet Interviews And yet that is what happens when the games youngest and sweetest contestant Rue (Amandla Stenberg) after bonding with Katniss is abruptly killed. Everything that happens out in the field is captured by countless hidden cameras (Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern shift between lush steady camerawork for ""objective"" coverage and a jittery hand-held style for on-the-spot verite footage) and Rues death ignites unrest in her working-class district. But this represents a mere prelude to what Katniss pulls off in the ingenious climax which troubles the already suspicious president and neatly sets the stage for the political turmoil of the sequels. A crucial area in which the film falls far short of the book is the charade aspect as Katniss experiences it of her ""romance"" with Peeta. Without her interior narration and deliberate play-acting once she allies herself with her fellow District 12 cohort the gradations of her ambivalence and acceptance are smoothed over to the point of blandness. The survival story retains its vitality but what lies underneath is stunted. At the center of things most of the time Lawrence remains compelling all the way. As in Winters Bone shes onscreen alone or nearly so a great deal and she holds ones attention unselfconsciously without asking for attention or even doing much other than the task at hand. Lawrence is one of those performers the camera loves; her appearance alters in different scenes and shots -- lingering baby fat shows here she resembles a Cleopatra there -- and she can convey a lot by doing little. An ideal screen actress. The young men on hand cant measure up to her standards and while Harrelson has his moments the combustible Haymitch has been rather cleaned up from the book. Making a decided impression here is Lenny Kravitz who will probably field more acting offers after his turn as Katniss charismatic stylist Cinna (quite a few characters are named after Romans). Production values are ample if not lavish. The soundtrack a joint venture between composer James Newton Howard and executive music producer T Bone Burnett features an intriguing blend of regional and atmospheric flavors (the end-title tune from Taylor Swift engages on a first listen) though more musical propulsion would have helped juice things up in the late going.
