Comments click to enlarge My Soul to Take Rated R  107 minutes  2010 Back in the 70s Wes Craven made a name for himself with cheapo drive-in shockers like The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes that exploited the craziness and creepiness of rural America. But A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Scream (1996) turned Craven into a more avuncular horror figure who backed away from the gleeful sadism of his younger colleagues. My Soul to Take is bloody enough to have earned an R rating but the gimmicky story line lets you know right away that the movie is all in fun. Sixteen years after a schizophrenic man murders his pregnant wife and escapes from the police seven kids born that same day--among them the killers son who survived the assault on his mother--begin to turn up dead. Theres some malarkey about each kid having inherited one of the maniacs personalities though Craven never does much with that except to point the finger of suspicion at junior. By J.R.

"Movie review My Soul to Take - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review My Soul to TakeWes Cravens creaky 3-D horror film stars RA!ul Esparza as the Riverton Ripper.October 09 2010|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times ""My Soul to Take"" the first film horror-meister Wes Craven has both written and directed since 1994s ""New Nightmare"" (and his first picture in 3-D) is a thrill-free snooze that will certainly rank as one of the least a if not the least a effective entries in Cravens nearly 40-year canon of cinematic shockers. The overly complex story goes something like this Sixteen years ago in the town of Riverton Abel Plenkov (RA!ul Esparza) a schizophrenic family man with seven personalitiesaone of which was that of a murderer a killed his pregnant wife and was then shot by local police but not before the dying madman vowed to return one day to murder the seven local children all born that night. Nothing if not a monster of his word Plenkov or the Riverton Ripper as hes known seemingly reappears exactly 16 years later to make good on his deadly promise. With me so far? As the suburban legend has it each of the Rippers personalities may have found its way into each of the seven Riverton kids born that fateful night. So maybe Plenkov is still alive and murdering or maybe if he actually is dead its his darkest soul thats doing his dirty work. And if so which of the seven 16th-birthday celebrants is running around with a knife hacking up folks? The expression TMI (too much information) couldve been hatched expressly for this movie. The protracted first half of the film follows a day in the soapy high school lives of the Riverton Seven (they have a nickname too) a group of attractive types including the hot jock (Nick Lashaway) the cool beauty (Paulina Olszynski) the religious chick (Zena Grey) the generic Asian (Jeremy Chu) and the noble blind boy ( Denzel Whitaker) whos African American for good measure. Then theres Bug (Max Thierot) a sweet-faced underdog plagued by nightmares on his own kinda Elm Street and his best friend Alex (John Magaro) a wisecracker with an abusive stepdad. (A vile 19-year-old Queen Bee and eternal senior lovingly named Fang played by Emily Meade also factors in.) As these mystically connected kids start getting bloodily picked off by a baritone in an ugly-crazy-silly costume Bug becomes the prime suspect a or maybe the groups chief savior that is if (reread Paragraph 3 here if needed) Plenkov still lives. No one knows the answer to that one least of all Bug who in the films equally lackluster second half is stuck in his house to defend his family and others against that knife-wielding maniac in the nutty outfit. Sadly theres not an ounce of tension or a single decent scare to be found amid any of this convoluted mayhem. And while the performers do what they can with the creaky material there are some dialogue humdingers (""Its not OK for everyone to be killing each other all the time"") not even the best actor could make fly. As for the 3-D (the film was converted in post-production) its a thoroughly pointless garnish that never has any impact except to darken the screen (while wearing those clunky glasses) and command a higher ticket price. But truly thats the least of this duds myriad problems. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Texas Killing FieldsOctober 14 2011Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-soul-to-take-20101009,0,6615730.story",200,mysoultotake1,mysoultotake,latimes

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The crime of 3-D is that with a bad movie the technology holds you hostage. Its inexplicable why you have to wear the glasses which honestly start to hurt a little. They always do but when you dont need them the indignity hurts even more. I watched at least a quarter of ""My Soul to Take the worst horror movie Wes Cravens made perhaps ever with the glasses off. It was shot -- and is available -- in a standard format and like many conversions the 3-D gimmick is like watching a movie through an ashtray.The movie tells a tale of a generic town -- its in Massachusetts -- with a serial-killer hangover. A madman is fatally apprehended but apparently survives by squatting in the bodies of seven kids born simultaneously in the same hospital the night he died. I should apologize to Wes Craven if Im getting something wrong. Ive seen the movie and read the synopsis. But I never knew what was going on for very long. Im not sure Craven knows either. Why are the kids with whom we catch up 16 years later offed so randomly? Characters die simply because they must but not without first delivering reams of exposition.The killer has long crypto-dreadlocks and a face we dont really see. He might be one of the teens. He might have wandered over from the set of ""Predator 14. The parents here know more than theyre telling and the secrecy angers the kids. Its Cravens ""Nightmare on Elm Street done as a CW drama.To the movies credit its badness isnt unappealing. The incoherence is actually interestingly weird. Theres a dream-like character to the movies sloppiness. Metaphysics and Native American mysticism emerge as themes and theres a well-choreographed mirroring moment between the resident head case Bug (Max Thieriot) and his exasperating friend Alex (John Magaro) that feels almost psychological. The whole thing is halfhearted and unfocused though. And why the 3-D? With a bad movie putting the glasses in your lap once in a while is a sort of rejection.

Maybe he was preoccupied by ""Scream 4"" due out next spring.The relevant number in ""Soul"" is seven which after a labored overly long set-up is the quota of teenagers that a long-dead schizophrenic psycho killer is scheduled to carve up before the movie can end. Mr. Craven follows his usual recipe of comic pop-culture references and dreamy shocks but his heart doesnt seem to be in either. Only a few fleeting images -- a victim who had been thrown into a river suddenly appearing in a restroom mirror mutely reaching out from his watery grave; a girl being dragged down an embankment her arms spread like an angel -- have the old Craven poetry.The story is in the overly complicated vein that this genre prefers each of the seven teenagers born the night the killer died (or did he?) has inherited one aspect of his fractured personality. But the revelations when they come dont register as either creepy or funny.One thing that does depending on your point of view is that the schizoid killer is played -- complete with alternating voices for his good and bad sides -- by the stage star Raul Esparza. ""My Soul to Take"" is a long way from Sondheim Mamet and Pinter but perhaps Mr. Esparza was able to draw on an earlier Broadway role Riff Raff in the ""The Rocky Horror Show."" (Whether thats creepy or funny is up to the viewer.)""My Soul to Take"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and blood.

I know its in 3-D not because of any additional depth-of-field detectable in the image but because I do not usually wear glasses nor pay 17.50 for a movie. The conversion was done well after production at the behest of avaricious rip-off artists who detest their potential customers. Anyhow. The film begins with the last hurrah of a small-town serial killer a first ten minutes that sets the jabbering pace as were volleyed with multiple personalities voodoo exploding ambulances and characters named ""Abel"" and ""William Blake."" Sixteen Years Later The seven kids born on the night The Rippers bloody reign ended gather for the annual ""Ripper Day"" anniversary observance. Shortly after the resurrected Ripper resembling a Klingon hobo starts culling down the seven leaving stage-blood and aborted subplots in his wake. There are shades of Elm Street with suburban parents hiding dark secrets and a cast of young unknowns including a good Max Thieriot as the unstable chief suspect and a striking redhead named Zena Grey. All are kept busy by the mile-a-minute exposition of Cravens 2000-plus page Giallo-illogical script which includes space for transmigrating souls and California Condors. All might be good for a flask-to-the-theater laugh if not for the unconscionable price gouging.

The plot of My Soul to Take is a mess but here goes Sixteen years ago the spirit of a demonic murderer called The Ripper was released when his host body died. Local lore says the evil soul jumped into one of seven children born in his town that same day like a homicidal Dalai Lama. Now those kids are high schoolers who have to figure out which one of them is the new Ripper before he kills them all. The slew of obvious ""Why?"" and ""How?"" questions wont even bug you once you get bogged down in the movies stock characters and unimaginative killings (pointlessly shot in 3D). Worst of all the guy who created Freddy Krueger cant even manage a scary bad guy The Ripper who materializes as a hairy brute doesnt conjure up nightmares as much as the image of a homeless Klingon.

Daily Edition Login to download My Soul to Take -- Film Review 124 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Its your money thats at greater stake with this subpar horror entry in barely noticeable 3D. TWITTER Understandably not screened for critics ""My Soul to Take"" represents a particular disappoint because it represents the first writing-directing effort from Wes Craven since his fiendishly clever ""Wes Cravens New Nightmare"" in 1994. Unfortunately the director of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" ""Scream"" and other horror classics comes a cropper with this dull talk-heavy snoozer that most closely resembles something that would show up on the CW network. Even more egregious is the converted 3D presentation forcing moviegoers to cough up extra bucks for effects that are barely noticeable -- other than of course the inevitable increased dimness. After a fairly slam-bang opening sequence introducing serial killer the Riverton Ripper who is promptly dispatched (seemingly) after attempting to murder his family the film fast forwards 16 years. We are then introduced to the Riverton Seven a septet of local teens who were born on the day the Ripper died with one of them possibly harboring his murderous soul. Their number soon dwindles as each proceeds to suffer a gruesome death at the hands of a faceless killer with the most obvious suspect being Bug (Max Thieriot) a rather disturbed youth with a strange obsession for the vulturelike California condors. Unfortunately neither the Riverton Ripper nor his faceless successor is likely to compete with Freddy Krueger in iconic horror-movie villain terms and the overall proceedings lack the wit and style that marked the best of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" series. Cravens trademark satirical humor sadly is in little evidence here though he does try at times most notably in an absurd sequence that riffs off of the classic mirror routine famously performed by the Marx Brothers in ""Duck Soup."" The film becomes particularly leaden as it lurches endlessly toward its conclusion with the action such as it is giving way to endlessly confusing exposition that had the audience stirring restlessly. The generic teen characters are dully played by the youthful ensemble though the wild-eyed Thieriot does try his best to create a memorably weird figure. At one point in the film Craven makes a classic mistake showing a clip of Alfred Hitchcocks ""The Birds."" It only serves to remind us that our money would have been better spent renting horror classics on DVD.

Theres sure to be a barrage of publicity and audience curiosity when Wes Craven Kevin Williamson and Co. revive their decade-dormant ""Scream"" franchise next spring. But buzz has been conspicuously mute around Cravens current 3D horror exercise ""My Soul to Take"" which opened Oct. 8 without advance press screenings and its easy enough to see why This dumb derivative teen slasher movie would be uninspiring coming from any writer-director let alone one with several genre classics under his belt. Likely to exit most markets well before Halloween pic should post fair quick-playoff numbers before cashing in on ancillary. Heavy-handed prologue sets the tone as devoted small-town husband and father Abel (Raul Esparza) suddenly realizes hes got multiple personalities and is indeed the murderous Riverton Ripper. His pregnant wife does not survive this discovery leaving a toddler daughter the familys seeming sole survivor. In a rote gotcha-hes-not-dead-yet moment (not his first) a seriously wounded Abel escapes police custody flees into surrounding woods and is never found. Sixteen years later the towns youth sustain a macabre tradition called ""Ripper Night"" observing not only the killers last-known hurrah but also the eerily coincidental birthdays of seven teens all born prematurely the same hour Abels spree ended. These ""Riverton Seven"" consist of doe-eyed naif Bug (Max Thieriot) rumored to have been institutionalized for mental instability plus his prankster best friend Alex (John Magaro); cute girl Brittany (Paulina Olszynski); jock jerk Brandon (Nick Lashaway); devoutly religious Penelope (Zena Grey); blind Jerome (Denzel Whitaker); and Jay (Jeremy Chu) who doesnt survive long enough to demonstrate any earmarking characteristics. Sure enough Jay doesnt make it home that night meeting up with somebody in a Ripper mask and costume who unfortunately isnt just playing around. Next day business briefly goes on as usual as Bug and Alex scheme to upset the iron rule of school bitch Fang (Emily Meade) evade Brandons bullying fist and sort out the intricacies of Penelope crushing on Bug whos crushing on Brittany whos crushed on by Brandon. Soon several among these variously sweet 16-year-olds are fertilizing the forest done in by you-know-what wielding the original killers blade (which is engraved with the subtle motto ""vengeance""). ""My Soul to Take"" features the usual number of false scares and red herrings in addition to actual mayhem but rarely raises the pulse even at the height of mortal peril. Indeed its a pretty soporific affair bogged down by awkward expository dialogue one-dimensional characters (or ones whose suggested hidden sides turn out to be mere tease) bland atmospherics and unmemorable action. Final revelation of the perps identity makes less sense than a half-dozen alternatives might have but by then few viewers will care. Perfs are adequate within the materials considerable limits; production packaging is polished. Quality of the 3D is decent though theres little sign that pic was designed to take particular advantage of that format. R rating seems to be as much for a few F-bombs dropped as for the fairly mild gore.
