Columbia Pictures Lets cut to the crucial question How is the new girl in David Finchers version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""? Shes fine thank you very much. That is to say Rooney Mara looks just as bizarre as Noomi Rapace did in the role of Lisbeth Salander the poster girl for punk and spunk in the Swedish-language trilogy. And she cuts just as striking a figure riding a motorcycle surfing the web or taking and giving terrible punishment. But theres a crucial difference. Lisbeth 1 was black-light incandescence burning with focused anger. Lisbeth 2 is recessive haunted sometimes bummed and occasionally blank but clearly alienated from the vile world in which Lisbeth 1 fiercely claimed her place. That may leave fans of the original feeling alienated too not only from Lisbeth but from the spectacle of a remake that has much to recommend it--high-end craftsmanship a singular heroine a labyrinthine mystery an intriguing milieu--yet lacks a vital spark. Fans of the original are not to be sure the remakes main target audience. Americans dont turn out in massive numbers for foreign-language films even when theyre as popular as this one was. So theres plenty of pent-up curiosity about Lisbeth one of the most original figures in movie history as well as standing demand for well-made thrillers of which this is one. (Steven Zaillian adapted the screenplay from the Stieg Larsson novel. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did the powerful score.) Watch a clip from the film ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" based on the best selling novel and directed by David Fincher. Video courtesy Columbia Pictures. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a sharp departure from Mr. Finchers previous film ""The Social Network"" in the preface of which Ms. Maras Erica fought a spirited verbal duel with Jesse Eisenbergs Mark. The new films plot centers on an antisocial network a Swedish family with a history of Fascist leanings that holds the secret to the fate of a young woman who disappeared 40 years ago. Daniel Craig is Mikael Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who teams up with Lisbeth to investigate the extremely cold case and uncovers more corruption than either of them bargained for. A cool actor turned chilly in the Scandinavian winter Mr. Craig nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikaels impassive affect. Christopher Plummer is the familys smoothly expansive plutocrat. Stellan Skarsgard puts another construction on smoothness as one of its least savory members. Yet the film is no departure at all from such earlier Fincher films as ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" since it involves as they did acts of ghastly violence committed under grisly circumstances. Jeff Cronenweths cinematography does lustrous variations on the darkness the director favors; Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack. One script change warrants discussion--I wont discuss it because I wont divulge it--but most of the film follows the original sometimes shot for shot. Its certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it however theres no way of unseeing it and nothing in the new one to top it. The Adventures of Tintin Watch a clip from the new animated feature ""The Adventures of Tintin"" directed by Steven Spielberg. Video courtesy Paramount Pictures. Its easy to see what the boy in Steven Spielberg saw in the Belgian comic books that led to this 3-D animated action adventure--a boy reporter in a simpler era throwing himself into globe-girdling exploits. Spielberg the man seized on the Herge series which ran from 1929 to 1983 as a chance to work with animation for the first time. (And to join forces with another Herge fan Peter Jackson who served as producer.) What the two filmmakers plus a small army of artists and technicians have wrought of these tales is appealingly earnest at first and charmingly innocent of the glib hip that pollutes so many cartoon features. The motion-capture animation is spectacular a float planes crash landing on a desert; motorcyclists on a wild chase after a falcon in flight; a dam break; a flood; dueling cargo cranes dueling duelists. Yet the action grows wearisome as it grinds on and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings. ENLARGE Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and Tintin (Jamie Bell) in The Adventures of Tintin. Paramount Pictures Jamie Bell is the voice of Tintin a swoop-haired youngster of indeterminate age who is always accompanied by his dog Snowy. Andy Serkis is Captain Haddock Tintins boozy companion on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship. Daniel Craig free of Mikael Blomkvists restraint is the extravagantly vocal villain Sakharine. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" has opened in the U.S. without a huge marketing push after debuting in Europe where the comic books have long been popular and where the film has been doing big business. It will be fascinating to see whether audiences here respond to its curious mix of old-fashioned hero and new-fangled technology. A preteen girl sitting next to me at a screening was literally leaping out of her seat during the action sequences but her parents may have been studio executives. Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close ENLARGE Max von Sydow and Thomas Horn in Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close. Warner Bros. Pictures Ive heard people say they werent sure even a decade after Sept. 11 if they could handle this film about a boy whose beloved father has recently died in one of the twin towers. I know what they mean. Almost half a century after Dallas I still have trouble watching film of President Kennedys assassination. Yet Stephen Daldrys screen version of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel adapted by Eric Roth proves hard to handle for other reasons. The productions penchant for contrivance is insufferable--not a single spontaneous moment from start to finish--and the boy is so precocious you want to strangle him. Its surely not the fault of Thomas Horn the remarkable young man who plays him. In widely seen clips from his winning appearance on ""Teen Jeopardy"" Thomas was thoughtful articulate and poised beyond his years. That must have made him seem like a natural for the role of Oskar Schell who may or may not have Aspergers syndrome and who outdoes any of J.D. Salingers gifted kids in richness of vocabulary and complexity of ideas. Watch a clip from the film ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock. Video courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. But Oskar in print is one thing. As you read the book (which I also disliked) you are tracking at your own pace the workings of the boys mind--and the pain in his heart--as he searches New York City for a lock that matches a key his father has left behind. Its quite another thing to watch Oskar on the screen with no respite from his shrill voice or his mannered behavior. A less remarkable actor--or Thomas himself directed for simplicity--might have taken the curse off the movies case of the terminal cutes. Mr. Daldry however chose to push his young star in the opposite direction toward a totality of artifice that dilutes the impact of Sept. 11 and underscores the blissed-out illogic of Oskars quest. Sandra Bullock is Oskars griefstruck mother Linda and Tom Hanks is his father Thomas. In flashbacks father and son express their special relationship with such relentlessly abstruse conversations that you long for one or the other to say something like ""Lets have scrambled eggs."" Max von Sydow gives a lively performance as The Renter a mysterious mute. In another film his silence might be golden. In this one it goes platinum. Watch a clip from the new film ""We Bought a Zoo"" starring Matt Damon. We Bought a Zoo Matt Damon stars in and gracefully carries Cameron Crowes family film about a widower who gives his two kids a new life by buying a rural house that comes with a zoo. Its really an achievement when you stop to think of it for Mr. Damon to switch from tough-as-nails Jason Bourne to tender-hearted Benjamin Mee but he makes the transition look effortless. A good thing too because the production has been constructed effortfully from notions and elements that hang together fairly loosely. ENLARGE Matt Damon in We Bought a Zoo. Twentieth Century Fox The zoo and its animals seldom transcend the status of props; its hardly helpful when Benjamin notes that ""the sellers say you dont even need any special knowledge to run a zoo; what you need is a lot of heart."" Dont tell that to the animal-rights people whove been calling attention to the foolish line and dont expect to be overly impressed by the expertise of Kelly the zookeeper who is played by Scarlett Johansson. (Or by her performance which at times seems uncertain.) What holds the film together is its genuine sense of family--Benjamins daughter is played delightfully by Maggie Elizabeth Jones and his son by Colin Ford--and Mr. Damons portrayal of a loving father moving beyond the grief of losing his wife. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a movie you want to like and a movie you can enjoy if you cut its slackness some slack. DVD Focus ENLARGE Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig isnt just acceptable but formidable as a newly minted James Bond. Hes at least the equal of the best ones before him and beats all of them in sheer intensity. The English star (he became one as soon as the movie opened) makes physicality exciting emotional detachment interesting and stirrings of tenderness affecting. This chapter of the Bond saga set forth as a prequel was directed by Martin Campbell. Mads Mikkelsen is the villainous banker Le Chiffre. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd a lissome British treasury official and emotional chameleon. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) Matt Damon gives a remarkable performance as the mild-mannered bespectacled and murderous Tom Ripley. The year is 1958 and the place is Italy where rich young Americans play expatriate games aboard yachts on azure seas or dart through ancient hill towns on sputtering Vespas and Lambrettas. But Tom who is poor cant acknowledge his hearts true desire to Jude Laws fragrantly decadent playboy Dickie Greenleaf. Tom yearns to be Dickie Greenleaf and he will be before the end of this lush if overlong thriller which the late Anthony Minghella directed from his adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths novel. Billy Elliot (2000) Stephen Daldrys debut feature is a piece of flagrant feelgoodism thats saved by a Bell--Jamie Bell in the title role. Elevenyear-old Billy was born to dance. More remarkably for a working-class child born to dance classical ballet though he doesnt know it until he goes to his weekly boxing lesson and comes upon a ballet class in the same building. His dancing teacher is played by the splendid Julie Walters and its nice to see the two working off one another the cigarette-smoking dame and the impish slip of a boy with a shining future Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

AND MISS Damon walks the walk with Paltrow A- The Talented Mr. Ripley Genre Drama Mystery and Thriller; Starring Jude Law Matt Damon Gwyneth Paltrow Cate Blanchett; Director Anthony Minghella; Author Anthony Minghella; Release Date Wide 12/25/1999; Runtime (in minutes) 139; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted December 29 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a sneaky murdering enigma in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" writer-director Anthony Minghellas artful transposition of Patricia Highsmiths chillingly perverse 1955 psychological crime novel into an attractive unsettling crime travelogue. The unnerving antihero doesnt approach the amorality of Highsmiths Ripley an icy psychopath who ruthlessly kills to maintain the cultured comfortable life he has made for himself by stealing another mans identity. But Minghellas Ripley may be a better more dangerous phony for our time pleasant except when cornered cute except when evil. Embodied by Damon with his fashion-ad grace and magazine-cover smile this 90s version of a mid-century devil displays a greater range of emotion than the late Highsmith favored and expresses his homoerotic longings more openly than she had interest in. Hes a killer as puppy dog an accidental psychopath. As such hes as good a Ripley for Minghella to start with as any in trying to make cinematic sense of one of literatures great modern con men previously brought to the screen in Rene Clements 1960 French eyeful ""Purple Noon."" And indeed the literary-minded British filmmaker who three years ago wrestled the hard-to-adapt novel ""The English Patient"" into the Oscar ring has made a classy subtle drama that incorporates fine jazz and divine tourist vistas the pleasures of young men roughhousing and the beauty of young women sashaying through the streets like Ruth Orkin photos come to life. Having taken the gentler more scenic route to displaying Ripleys dark talents - talents that include lying forging flattering and imitating - Minghella makes an enticing intelligent well-shaped picture about the extreme perils of class envy and sexual panic. The setting is a sun-drenched late-50s Italy where an impoverished Tom Ripley having passed himself off as an upper-crust Princeton grad has been dispatched by a wealthy New York businessman (James Rebhorn) to bring home his indolent playboy son Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) currently living la dolce vita with his equally languid American girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Enchanted by Dickie (and who wouldnt be - Law in a star-making performance is the sexually magnetic center of every scene hes in) Tom becomes a favored playmate of his wanton new friend. When the two exhilarated sweat-shiny Americans get down in a smoky Italian jazz joint its a cinch to feel the boy-to-boy crackle in the air. Paltrow does what she can with Marge the real outsider in this psychodrama but theres not much for the actress to do except look suspicious by degrees as she did in ""A Perfect Murder."" Damon is at once an obvious choice for the part and a hard sell to audiences soothed by his amiable boyishness. The actors persona that of well-adjusted Private Ryan unwilling to leave the battlefield without his buddies doesnt suggest a fellow who can convincingly go postal. But the facade works surprisingly well when Damon holds that gleaming smile just a few seconds too long his Eagle Scout eyes fixed just a blink more than the calm gaze of any non-murdering young man. And in that opacity we see horror. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" slithers along with great elegance and purpose for most of Ripleys reign stumbling only at the end when Minghella trips on the limitations imposed by his own updated psychoanalysis. But one schematic addition proves invaluable As Meredith a rich American deb to whom Tom bound for Italy has passed himself off as Dickie - a deception for which someone will eventually pay - Cate Blanchett fills her small role with note-perfect detail. By the end when Ripleys talents threaten to fail him shes the reason. Somehow believe it or not I think the ornery talented mystery novelist who invented him might have been pleased by such a turnabout.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

RIPLEY Mystery thriller. Starring Matt Damon Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by Anthony Minghella. (Rated R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If anybody can create sympathy for the devil the angelic Matt Damon can. As the title character of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" he plays an ingratiating sociopath who works his way through the American upper crust at play in Italy leaving behind a bloody but elusive trail. The mystery is not who did it but whether he will get caught. This thriller is so expertly -- and perversely -- poised that audience members may find themselves secretly rooting for the duplicitous Ripley. Related Stories Everyones Talented in `Ripley / Matt Damon stars as deadly chameleon The talent is by no means limited to Mr. Ripley. Damon is matched in every slippery turn by a right-on-the-money cast that includes Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Director Anthony Minghella (""The English Patient"") adapts the second screen version of the Patricia Highsmith novel for fresh surprises. Along the way he exposes the dirty little secret of American democracy the impenetrable barrier the upper class erects around itself. So the question becomes is it better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody? Minghella takes a close look at this question over a never-lagging-for-a-moment two hours and 20 minutes. He gives it so many seductive twists across the map of Italy that the upwardly mobile among us if theyre honest with themselves will opt for the fake. Tom Ripley does and never looks back. In the chase for the best holiday movie this season ""Ripley"" is one step ahead of the rest. The film certainly begins with the slickest main titles as the many-faceted Mr. Ripleys various attributes flash by replacing the word ""talented."" The only thing they leave out is that he is poor and has no intention of staying that way. In Damons uncanny performance people think Ripleys ""an exceptional young man"" and theres no doubt of that. He is first seen accompanying a classical singer at the piano but next hes brushing down gentlemens clothes for tips. No one has to show him the money. He has an extraordinary nose for sniffing out the rich even when they are trying to play down their status by traveling under their mothers name so no one will recognize them. The chameleon Ripley takes on the attributes accents and expressions of the rich in an -- instant. He can do imitations of someone moments after meeting him -- or her. His own look is nondescript a 50s version of a preoccupied nerd dorky eyeglasses downturned smile and all. If things go against him he can turn on a dime. His other talents forging signatures and telling bald- faced lies without batting an eyelash. He has a remarkable capacity to shrug off setbacks and just keep moving. A wealthy shipbuilder named Greenleaf puts down his guard and takes Ripley for someone he can trust. He dispatches Tom to Italy to persuade his neer-do-well son Dickie to come home. As the supercilious Dickie the tawny Law (""eXistenZ"") catches exactly his characters curious balance of attraction and repulsion. The thoroughgoing expatriate at leisure he indulges his love for boating and jazz at lively waterfront joints. The kiss-on-both-cheeks greeting for men and women alike Italian style is second nature to him. Paltrow (""Shakespeare in Love"") is Dickies blue-blood girlfriend Marge coolly perceptive but not enough so to see that hes two-timing her. It takes her a while to catch on to Ripley too. A REPELLENT EXPATRIATE Hoffman (""Happiness"" ""Flawless"") plays the loathsome Freddie a fellow expat. Someone describes him as ""the cream of America -- rich and thick."" His indolent drawl outdoes even William F. Buckleys. In Hoffmans performance Freddie is so repellent that it wouldnt be surprising if some of his so-called friends would be happy to see him dead. Freddie is not only loathsome hes too smart for his own good. He sees through Ripley. Wonderful character actors show up as the Italian police including a volatile inspector from Rome. An ominous private detective whom the elder Greenleaf hires also appears and does an extraordinary reversal. Ripleys a quick study. As soon as he learns that Dickie is a jazz buff he gives himself a crash course -- and Damon later sings a tender version of ""My Funny Valentine."" The effective score includes Miles Davis ""Nature Boy"" -- though the lyrics are not sung jazz fans will recall that they refer to ""a strange enchanting boy"" a perfect choice. Ripley must be a good chess player too because he sees many moves ahead and lets social butterfly Meredith Logue (Blanchett) mistake him for Dickie. The impersonation will come in useful later -- until it all backfires. Eventually Ripley will brazenly take over Dickies identity to the point that he can register at posh hotels and cash checks in the other mans name. Ripley will even tell the truth when it serves his purposes. He lets Dickie know that he is Dickies fathers paid emissary because he sees that Dickie will get a kick out of stringing Dad along. ""Im the brother you never had"" Ripley confides. Each of them including Marge is an only child; i.e. self-centered. There are some people who are going to say with some justice that Dickie gets what he deserves. Dickies attention is like a spotlight When Law turns it on people it makes them glow. It works with other women besides Marge whom Dickie wants to get into bed and -- who knows -- it begins to look as if it works with men too. SEEING THE GEARS TURNING There are limits however to Dickies attention. He gets bored with Ripley and tells him he has become a leech. Ripley is quick on his feet and Damon lets you see the gears of the mans mind turning as he feigns innocence and panic starts to slip through. It is an altogether amazing performance. Ripley comes on to whomever he thinks can be useful to him. A gay undercurrent begins as a little frisson and breaks through the surface before this film reaches its conclusion where Minghella is confident enough to leave something to the viewers imagination. It will also leave audiences in a state of suspended tension that they havent felt since ""The Sixth Sense."" This is the second excellent film based on the Highsmith novel. Rene Clements ""Plein Soleil"" a French version called ""Purple Noon"" in English was released in 1960. More condensed and economical it came to a different ending and starred Alain Delon as the American Ripley. Believe it or not.

VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K If youre writer-director Minghella you adapt another difficult book for the screen. This time hes chosen the popular 1950s suspense novel ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" the first in a series of ""Ripley"" books by the late Patricia Highsmith. And you hire the same behind-the-scenes award-winning people you used before. And you hope lightning strikes twice. It seems to have worked. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" has received five Golden Globe nominations this week including best dramatic film of the year. Both Matt Damon and Jude Law are nominated (for best actor and best supporting actor respectively) and Minghella is once again singled out for his direction as is Yared for his musical score. This isnt the first time Highsmiths work has been made into a major motion picture. Alfred Hitchcock made ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) based on one of her books. And this same ""Ripley"" novel was made into a film once before -- in 1960 it was released as ""Purple Noon"" a French-Italian thriller starring Alain Delon and directed by Rene Clement. Chameleon at work This time Damon stars as Tom Ripley a young piano player from the wrong side of the tracks. Hes mistaken for a Princeton schoolmate of Dickie Greenleaf (Law) by Greenleafs millionaire father Herbert (James Rebhorn). He hires Tom to retrieve his son from the idle life hes living in Italy during the late 1950s. Dickie and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) befriend Tom -- despite their misgivings about who he really is -- and he quickly becomes something of a double agent. After confessing his true mission to Dickie and Marge he continues to take the elder Greenleafs money. But instead of trying to get Dickie to go home hes secretly in cahoots with the two young expatriates in their pursuit of ""la dolce vita."" Tom takes to that good life like a duck to water and begins to worship both Dickie and his wealth. But when Dickie tires of his new companion and threatens to cut him loose things turn violently dark. ""Its better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" -- -- Tom Ripley (Matt Damon)""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" At this the point the film departs from Highsmiths novel. Minghella has moved several dramatic actions deep into the story line. Concessions are made in order to maintain some audience sympathy for certain characters. Minghella has also created new characters including Meredith Logue played by Cate Blanchett. Meredith is another young wealthy American traveling in Europe. Tom introduces himself to her as Dickie and his relationship with her mirrors the one between the real Dickie and Marge. Eventually Merediths misinformation about Toms identity helps him to blur reality when it becomes necessary later in the film. This it turns out is the ""talent"" of Tom Ripley a criminal propensity for identity switches. We him across Italy watching him slip in and out of personalities covering his tracks along the way. Minghella has beefed up the novels character of Peter Smith-Kingsley played by Jack Davenport. Peter offers Tom a last-minute chance at a happy life which hes unable to take. MESSAGE BOARD Does The Talented Mr. Ripley have what it takes for an Academy Award? Give us your take on the Oscar hopefuls. ALSO CNN Interactives Jamie Allen discovers Mr. Minghellas inspiration for Mr. Ripley CNN Showbiz Todays Sherri Sylvester discovers that talent isnt limited to Mr. Ripley Unfunny valentine This intriguing and stylish story is told through Ripleys eyes and he says at one point the signature line for his character Highsmiths book and Minghellas film ""Its better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" That sentiment is at the heart of this film. Were asked to identify with an anti-protagonist. And because of this tightly written script by Minghella and the impressive talents of Damon we do. Law is stunningly charismatic as Dickie Greenleaf and his Golden Globe nomination is greatly deserved. Both Paltrow and Blanchett are perfectly pitched as unwilling foils in Ripleys fiendish plot. Also well-earned Yareds nomination for his musical score. The music is almost a character in the film. In the original novel Dickie is a painter. Minghella has made him a saxophonist in love with jazz. Tom is an opera buff and their different tastes in music inform their characters. Jazz (Dickie) is full of improvisation loose and relaxed. Opera (Tom) is rigid and controlled. Opera fans may also note a clever scene about halfway through the film. Tom is almost caught posing as Dickie at an operatic performance. The show onstage mirrors the plot of the film. Its Tchaikovskys ""Eugene Onegin"" based on Pushkins poem about a man who kills his best friend. Another musical moment that goes straight to the plot comes when Damon sings a la Chet Baker the song ""My Funny Valentine."" His longing for Dickie resonates in every note. (By the way Damons crooning is quite good not that he should quit his day job.) MORE REVIEWS Sunshine Boys and Girls Talk Talk Talk Talk Kiss Titan A.E.

Displaying impressive talent indeed ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a mostly intoxicating and involving tale of intrigue and crime that loses its stride somewhat in the home stretch. This highly scenic adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths classic murder meller is splendidly served by a beautiful cast headed by Matt Damon Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law and proves a fine follow-up by writer-director Anthony Minghella to his Oscar-winning ""The English Patient."" Outfitted with an immediately engaging story and appeal across the audience spectrum this Paramount-Miramax co-venture looks to be a muscular B.O. performer here and abroad. Well filmed in 1960 by French director Rene Clement as ""Plein soleil"" (Purple Noon) with Alain Delon Highsmiths 1955 novel the first in her Ripley series is an eerie tale of a young man trying to acquire what another has by murdering him. Minghella has upped the ante in numerous ways -- by emphasizing the gay angle as well as the murderers desire to assume the identity of the charismatic fellow he does away with and by populating the story with attractive expat Americans on the loose in the enticing Italy of the late 50s. Latter element gives the films first hour a truly heady feel as it settles luxuriantly in a world of sexy moneyed Yanks living la dolce vita around the beaches cafes and jazz clubs of the time. Its certainly a world that is enormously appealing to Tom Ripley (Damon) a nice well-spoken bespectacled kid from New York whos paid by shipbuilding tycoon Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to fetch back his wastrel son Dickie (Law) who has been spending his considerable allowance at a rapid pace in Europe. Quickly managing to ingratiate himself with the privileged Dickie and the latters beautiful writer girlfriend Marge (Paltrow) Tom becomes a happy hanger-on in their idyllic seaside town south of Naples; he amuses Marge and establishes a bond with the effervescent impulsive Dickie via jazz a passion they share at various boites up and down the coast. Revealing his mission to Dickie Tom becomes a ""double agent"" pretending to try to bring the young man home to Mr. Greenleaf but happily sharing in the money he supplies. The writing and playing of these scenes of youthful abandon could scarcely be better. The fluid casualness of the lifestyle the simultaneous sense of discovery and waste the awareness of personal beauty and sexual allure at their peak the feeling that things should always be this good but the knowledge that the moment cant last -- all this and more are present in the lightly witty banter and the chemistry that takes hold among the characters courtesy of the fine actors. At one point Marge confides to Tom that Dickie whom they both adore is like the sun warming anyone he blesses with his full attention and that it becomes cold when he turns elsewhere. Crucially Law fully measures up to this description easily functioning as the magnetic force that puts everyone around him in his orbit. As the glorious summer season ends however so does the wind shift on the happy threesome. A visit from Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a brash American dedicated to one-upmanship puts the lower-class Tom in foul humor; the very public suicide of a pregnant village girl causes the guilt-ridden Dickie to want to move on and Mr. Greenleafs cutting off of funds brings to a close this rarefied period in the groups lives. On a final boat ride in a small launch out of San Remo however Dickie suddenly erupts insulting Tom. Without seeming to mean to hurt him badly Tom hits Dickie with an oar; once the blood starts flowing freely however Tom thinks nothing of finishing off the friend he has envied and obsessed over since he arrived in Italy. One element that makes Highsmiths work so disquieting is her suggestion that anyone is capable of murder given the circumstances and motivation. Minghella has faithfully retained this theme as Tom Ripley with his clean-cut looks smart manner and monogrammed sports coat seems like anything but a candidate for serial killer. But once hes started once hes discovered what hes capable of a new life opens up for the young American one that includes trying to assume the identity (and bank account) of Dickie who Tom tells Marge has holed up in Rome for a few days. Ripleys talents include quick thinking on his feet and clever responses to difficult situations as they present themselves; in line with the jazz prominently featured on the soundtrack Tom is brilliant at improvising as well as at such useful tricks as forging Dickies signature and imitating voices. As he undertakes a shopping spree in Rome and successfully cashes checks using his friends passport as ID Tom also begins grooming himself to resemble his idol. The first time his ruse puts him in a bind is in a superb sequence at the opera where he accompanies a friendly but rather dim upper-class Yank Meredith (Cate Blanchett) who believes he is Dickie but also runs into Marge and her handsome British escort musician Peter (Jack Davenport). Again Tom ingeniously turns adverse conditions to his advantage. After Tom brutally slays the overly inquisitive Freddie and is forced to deal with the inevitable police investigation the film starts losing its special quality; it begins being led by the plot and becomes beholden to intricate procedural details which pushes it into more conventional territory than it has inhabited up to this point. Marge understandably becomes increasingly unhinged and suspicious with the passage of time Dickies father arrives on the scene to dig deeper into his sons mysterious disappearance than the Italian police have managed to do and the audacious Tom begins a liaison with Peter right under everyones noses. Chess game continues up through a tense shipboard climax. Unfortunately the film doesnt end where it should on a note of ambiguous alarm instead moving on to a rather unsatisfactory conclusion. Crime dramas such as this have generally come to be approached these days in a neo-noirish style but Minghella takes a gratifyingly non-genre tack working boldly in a full-bodied dramatic and visual manner that does not pigeonhole the material. Scenes are played out in a classical fashion that elicits many nuances from the actors and full value is extracted from the already rich material; for example the gay subtext of some of Highsmiths work including that in Hitchcocks adaptation of ""Strangers on a Train"" is brought to the fore here. Performances are aces top to bottom. Damon outstandingly conveys his characters slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation Law is the picture of indolent effortlessly alluring youth and Paltrow increasingly reveals deeper layers to a character that seems rather straightforward at the outset. The wondrous Blanchett exactly captures a particular sort of flighty American aristocrat Hoffman is similarly superb and exact in his portrait of a bright but boorish snob and Davenport is appealingly understated in what could have been a cardboard part. Rebhorn is authoritative as Dickies industrialist father while Philip Baker Hall takes command in his brief appearance as a straight-talking Yank investigator. This is the sort of picture that makes one dream about how great it must have been to be on the shoot. The diverse Italian locations ranging from Palermo to Venice and seemingly everywhere in between provide lenser John Seale with unsurpassable visual opportunities and he makes the most of them. Production designer Roy Walker has supplemented the natural wonders with details that evoke the country during a particularly memorable period of its recent history and Ann Roth and Gary Jones costumes prove very helpful in positioning the characters in relation to one another; Toms corduroy jacket which he persists in wearing instantly brands him as decidedly less cool than his fellow expatriates. Editor Walter Murch and composer Gabriel Yared also make important contributions.
