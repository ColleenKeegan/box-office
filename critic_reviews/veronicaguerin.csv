Comments Veronica Guerin The assassination of Dublin crime reporter Veronica Guerin in June 1996 shocked Ireland and galvanized the public against the previously untouchable drug traffickers whod done her in--a finer legacy than this well-meaning but simpleminded biopic. Confusing dread with suspense screenwriters Carol Doyle and Mary Agnes Donoghue open with Guerins murder and spend the remainder of the movie marching toward it with montage and voice-over hastily resolving the rest of the story before the credits roll. Cate Blanchett is magnetic in the title role but her star power is no substitute for characterization I cant guess to what degree the gutsy journalist was motivated by conscience professional ambition personal animus or plain adrenaline. Joel Schumacher directed; with Brenda Fricker and Ciaran Hinds excellent as Guerins conflicted informant. R 98 min. By J.R.

In 1996 the 37-year-old Irish journalist was shot and killed as her car idled at a traffic light just outside Dublin. The bullets came from members of the citys criminal underworld angered at Guerins continual reporting on drug lords and organized crime. She had received threats in the past -- her home had been invaded her family threatened and she had been assaulted -- but continued undaunted. Her death brought about changes in Irelands drug laws and she is now considered a folk heroine. Recently the International Press Institute named her as one of their 50 Press Freedom Heroes; in Ireland the new movie ""Veronica Guerin"" tells us ""everyone remembers where they were when they heard Veronica Guerin had been murdered."" So theres a rather heady challenge for a movie How do you make this legend into a real-life woman and how do you make an audience understand why a journalist would risk her own safety and that of her family for a story? Joel Schumachers movie does at least half of that thanks to a riveting performance by Cate Blanchett. Her Veronica sleek but sensible in a pert short hairdo breathes with vitality and energetic sexiness; zipping around in her red sports car and flirting shamelessly with colleagues and sources (teasing them with ""off the record"" guile). Shes a muckracker and she knows it delighting in her professions cliches. Lines like ""I got a tip -- this could be big"" could be dismissed as tepid writing but Blanchett brings a zing to them; Veronica seems the type who loves to talk as if shes in a movie. Movie review  ""Veronica Guerin"" with Cate Blanchett Gerard McSorley Ciaran Hinds Brenda Fricker Barry Barnes. Directed by Joel Schumacher from a screenplay by Carol Doyle and Mary Agnes Donoghue. 98 minutes. Rated R for violence language and some drug content. Several theaters. Though Veronica has a happy home life with her husband (Barry Barnes nicely playing the kind of hand-wringing role usually played by women) and small son this woman gets a charge from her work as an investigative journalist for the Sunday Independent and it shows in her sparkling eyes. And shes got a stubborn streak that adversity only strengthens. Driving away from a terrifying encounter with drug lord John Gilligan (Gerard McSorley) in which he beats her until she can barely walk her hands shake uncontrollably but her eyes remain focused as if shes already composing her story. Thats what drives Veronica; though shes deeply concerned for the pale ghostly children she sees playing with needles in Dublins bleak housing projects shes clearly motivated even more by a need to tell this ever-elusive story and by something within her that wont let the bad guys win. Pale and quavering at home after the attack she nonetheless tells her husband not to tell anyone of her fear. ""I dont want them to have it"" she says. Blanchetts words have the ring of truth to them and yet good as she is theres a hole at the center of this movie as Veronicas heart manages to elude us. You leave the movie still wondering why exactly she took such risks. Schumacher almost fetishizing her death here (the movie begins with it flashes back and leads up to it again with almost agonizing deliberateness) turns his film into a tearjerker at the end complete with maudlin music telling us that the angels are weeping. A woman died that day in 1996 not a saint and not a symbol. Despite its excesses ""Veronica Guerin"" comes tantalizingly close to introducing us to her.

(AP Photo/ Jonathan Hession) Photo JONATHAN HESSION Girl power? This thriller delivers the real thing / Blanchetts role as complex heroine elevates Veronica Guerin 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Veronica Guerin Drama. Starring Cate Blanchett Ciaran Hinds and Gerard McSorley. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Veronica Guerin"" tells the story of the real-life Irish reporter who set out to expose and destroy Dublin drug kingpins and ended up getting assassinated by them. So its the story of a heroine but wisely the filmmakers dont play up the nobility angle. The films success hinges on its avoidance of cliche -- including that other cliche the lovable anti-heroine -- and what emerges is an arresting portrait of a fascinating and somewhat mysterious personality. Congratulations to director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Carol Doyle for not including the typical Hollywood scene which usually comes right before the climax in which the protagonist sums up why shes willing to sacrifice all. As played by Cate Blanchett Guerins motives cannot fully be surmised even by herself. Shes an altruist to be sure but also a careerist a noodge and an extrovert with a relentless competitive streak. Blanchetts performance is a paradox in that its a deeply involving study of a woman skating on the surface of her own personality. Veronica is a charmer who tries compulsively to work everyone -- her husband her bosses the police even her enemies. She runs all day and writes all night and maintains a brave front partly to protect the people around her but partly to keep people from telling her to slow down. Her determination not to look inside is part of a conscious effort to avoid facing her fears but we sense that something else is going on too Shes trying not to discover that thing in her personality that makes her seek danger in the first place. From the beginning Veronica has a touch of the smart aleck who cant resist revealing how shrewd she is and how much she knows even when she should really keep quiet. When we first meet her shes gloating about winning a reckless-driving court case that might have resulted in her license being revoked. She brags while on the phone speeding. But theres a serious side to this brilliant chatterbox one thats moved and horrified by the sight of Dublin slum kids playing in the street with discarded hypodermic needles. She cant get it out of her head and so she makes it her mission to go after the dealers. She starts with nothing. She just walks into an abandoned house and interviews addicts. But soon she becomes adept at reading records and following money trails -- she becomes a great reporter and a dangerous nuisance. ""Veronica Guerin"" is a David and Goliath story and a tale of good versus evil but what gives it extra heft is that we really like her and we cant stand them. Her chief nemesis Gilligan (Gerard McSorley) is a pathetic little dictator an out-of-control bully with a harridan for a wife and a harem of drunken bimbos. His associate Traynor (Ciaran Hinds) is a big hulk of a guy but hes scared -- of Gilligan and also of Veronica. These guys have the henchmen and the power yet theyre terrified of this middle-class wife and mother. The ending we know going in. The movies surprises for those unfamiliar with the real-life drama have to do with how far the dealers are willing to go in threatening Veronica and how much she is willing to ignore. (The details wont be revealed here.) Our sense that Veronicas pursuit is just a little bit neurotic and even possibly not worth it makes it all the more interesting emphasizing the protagonists unique nature while lending a note of ambiguity. Aside from one lapse into sentimentality -- immediately after the climax our ears are assaulted by a boy soprano singing a bad Irish ballad in a piercing voice -- Joel Schumacher has crafted a smart brisk thriller. More than that hes given us a compelling character study and a celebration of a kind of modern woman who just did not exist a few generations ago competent professional living on a cell phone working into the night. A fraction of the people who see ""Kill Bill"" or ""Charlies Angels"" will see ""Veronica Guerin"" but this is the real girl-power movie.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Veronica Guerin is all BlanchettBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The late Veronica Guerin was a dedicated determined and fearless journalist. She was also headstrong and a bit foolhardy. Cate Blanchett portrays the Irish heroine whose 1996 murder by the drug lords she exposed led to substantial changes in government. Profile in courage Cate Blanchett is the fearless reporter Vernoica Guerin. By Jonathan Hession Touchstone Pictures The film as directed by Joel Schumacher and based on actual events is capably told but Veronica Guerin is made gripping almost single-handedly by Blanchetts superlative performance. Guerin was a shrewd reporter who knew how to work her sources. She also had heart -- and an eye for a good story. In the course of reporting an article she is moved by the sight of children playing with a hypodermic needle on the streets of Dublin. She resolves to investigate drug trafficking and crime barons in Dublins roughest neighborhoods. More about the movie Veronica Guerin   1/2 Stars Cate Blanchett Gerard McSorley Ciaran Hinds Brenda Fricker Director Joel Schumacher Distributor Touchstone Pictures Rating R for violence language and some drug content Opens today nationwide Nothing seems to daunt the unstoppable Guerin. She is oblivious to resentment from other reporters for her growing celebrity status. She pumps her resistant sources doggedly. Though her life is threatened she ignores pleas to back off the investigations by family friends and co-workers. She is always courageous but not altogether likable as she takes less notice of her husband and child in her obsession with getting the story and exposing the druggy underworld knowingly jeopardizing the life of her young son. Her reporting reveals the structure of Dublins drug trade leading to the arrests of several key figures. But it takes Guerins death to galvanize the Irish citizenry as well as the powers that be. After her murder the Constitution is altered enabling the government to seize the assets of suspected drug barons. But there are some baffling inconsistencies. Its unclear whether those were a key part of the real Guerin or whether they are flaws in the movies depiction of her. Could someone as street-smart and savvy as Guerin really have been so oblivious in the last minutes of her life as to fail to notice several murderers lying in wait? She blithely speeds along a highway after a court hearing despite two recent attempts on her life one by a drug lord who beat her severely. Wouldnt she keep an eye out given her status as a target of vicious criminals? The films supporting performances are capable and convincing but the film belongs to Blanchett whose star turn as the brazen cocky and committed journalist lingers well after the credits have rolled.

But Guerin also made plenty of headlines in life directing her fierce energies into crime-beat journalism for the Sunday Independent Irelands biggest newspaper. The ballsy investigative reporter wrote stories that exposed the unchecked reach of Dublins violent drug underworld in the 1990s even after her family was threatened and she was shot in the leg and beaten up. In the end she was killed for her tenacity gunned down in her car at a traffic light in 1996 by a motorcyclist believed to be acting on drug-world orders. Guerin was 36. Her death prompted national outrage and led to vital reform of lax laws that let criminals flourish. ""Veronica Guerin"" though focuses intently on the living Dubliner and the finest honor director Joel Schumacher and screenwriters Carol Doyle and Mary Agnes Donoghue pay her - and an audience who may be learning about her work for the first time - is this Theres no airbrushing of character. Shes played with intelligence whipped clean of any airs and poses by the always cleanly intelligent Cate Blanchett who makes Guerin a 3-D woman not a 2-D heroine. Indeed Schumacher works with relative modesty himself (more ""Tigerland"" than ""Batman amp; Robin"") his tendency toward glitzy flourishes held in check perhaps by admiration for the unusual bravery yet identifiable averageness of Guerins life - and by the grounding landscape of Dublin itself in which the entire movie is shot. The film evades sensationalism even when the subjects chutzpah is sensational Guerins commitment is presented as no more or less impressive when she embeds herself with housing-project kids strung out on heroin than when she kicks a soccer ball around with her family. (A full subplot is condensed into a few scenes of no-frills affection between Guerin and her mother played with great flint by Brenda Fricker.) The movie presses forward with economy of storytelling - and to telegraph mood change musical tweets of Irish pipe. The reporter gathers information (and disinformation) from a roguish middle-management crime-gang weakling (wonderfully dark-scowled Ciaran Hinds). She waylays cops and politicians. She pushes her way into the face of an icily brutal drug lord (a doozy of a performance from Gerard McSorley) at his baronial home resulting in one of the most honestly terrifying moments in the history of journo-dramas. ""Veronica Guerin"" leaves no doubt that its subject wasnt the most elegant writer in the business and certainly not the easiest to work with. But it also leaves no doubt about the danger of what she did dressing in ladylike suits (she believed in the drama of presentation) to face serious thugs and reporting what she learned unintimidated. Her death was shocking; this well-made telling of her life is inspiring. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Its slickly packaged looks good in widescreen and toplines Cate Blanchett but producer Jerry Bruckheimer and helmer Joel Schumacher (reunited after last years ""Bad Company"") seem boxed in by the very recent story and by the challenge of making a driven rather foolhardy newspaperwoman into a sympathetic figure. So they have taken an accessible generic approach to the material treating it as a star vehicle with Blanchett whos in almost every scene driving the pic (though in one of her most actorly and emotionally least convincing perfs). Since opening in Ireland July 11 the picture has taken a warm 2.2 million in limited release though the first big test with non-Celts arrived with its Aug. 1 opening across Blighty. The filmmakers approach could help to give the heavily promoted pic more solid legs in the U.K. than usual for Irish-themed movies with tasty business likely in upscale and Irish areas on Stateside release this October. ""Guerin"" represents the second attempt to portray the life and death of the journo but comes no closer to the heart of its subject than the little-seen Joan Allen starrer ""When the Sky Falls"" three years ago. However unlike the earlier pic this one uses peoples real names (with the exception of a young cop). Pic opens on June 26 1996 as breezy Guerin (Blanchett) comes in front of a judge for the umpteenth time on a speeding charge. ""We all know who you are Miss Guerin but that doesnt grant you immunity"" says his lordship conveniently summing up her fatal personality flaw. Later while shes boasting on the phone about how lightly the judge let her off a motorbike pulls up and a man fires six shots into her body at point-blank range. Flashback ""two years earlier"" and Guerin is a reporter for Dublins high-profile Sunday Independent working the crime beat and looking for a cause. With only the barest of backgrounding in the script Guerin finds her cause in the citys appalling drug trade. While Guerin is questioning some young druggies elsewhere in the same housing project a squealer is being nailed to the floor personally by mobster Martin Cahill (Gerry OBrien equally chilling though physically different from Brendan Gleeson in John Boormans ""The General""). Despite denials by her main underworld informer John Traynor (Ciaran Hinds) Guerin reckons Cahill is behind Dublins drugs and -- in a technique that will get her into trouble later on -- simply goes to his house. When Cahill and some of his men are gunned down the cops are happy to let the IRA take the credit though Guerin suspects the slayings were drug-related. Unfortunately Traynor deliberately feeds her misleading info -- that the killings were ordered by Cahills cross-town rival Gerry Hutch (Alan Devine unctuously deadly). Only later does she learn they were decreed by John Gilligan (Gerard McSorley) a psychotic mobster who wanted to trigger a Dublin gang war and sweep up the spoils. After Guerin is shot in the leg she goes after Gilligan (at pics hour mark) with a visit that goes horribly wrong. The escalating battle leads inevitably to the events of July 26 1996 now replayed in full. Underneath its surface twists and turns the script by Carol Doyle (""Washington Square"") and Mary Agnes Donoghue (""Paradise"" ""White Oleander"") is simplistic with clearly defined heroes and villains and not too much local backstory to tax mainstream auds. Even though the audience may know whats coming Guerins murder plays powerfully at a visceral level as tautly and unflashily directed by Schumacher. The problem is identifying elsewhere with Guerins situation as her character willfully antagonizes Dublins extremely seedy crime world and seems driven more by personal ambition than saving the citys youth from drugs. Its almost academic to compare ""Guerin"" with the John Mackenzie-directed ""When the Sky Falls"" since that film was hardly released after its 2000 Toronto fest preem (it finally cropped up on HBO in the U.S.). But though the movies have a very different feel and look -- Mackenzies grittier and more moderately budgeted Schumachers purring along like an upscale studio picture -- its interesting that both fail to create a sympathetic main character while managing to surround her with a menagerie of well-etched supports. Allen came over as too brittle in the main role and looked uncomfortable. In contrast Blanchett gives it the whole actorly enchilada luxuriating in a very credible Dublin accent deploying standard movie-journo body language and generally acting up a storm. This makes for entertaining moments but doesnt make the viewer warm to her much more. The supporting perfs provide the real drama especially Hinds excellent turn as the outwardly macho but inwardly broken Traynor and McSorleys simmering portrayal of the psychotic Gilligan. Other roles are just bits with Brenda Fricker in briefly as Guerins mom and even Schumachers favorite thesp Colin Farrell popping up in a completely unnecessary cameo as a wacky tattooed bystander. Barry Barnes can do little with the blandly written role of Guerins supportive husband. Widescreen lensing by Brendan Galvin (""Behind Enemy Lines"") is unshowy but smoothly tooled with vibrant color processing -- from vivid reds to stygian blacks -- giving extra resonance to production designer Nathan Crowley and costume designer Joan Bergins lived-in sets and costumes. Harry Gregson-Williams supportive score obligingly slips into Celtic mode whenever called for and a song sung over the end roller by Sinead OConnor completes the ethnic packaging. In a labored attempt to end on an upbeat note pic features an extended coda that details the fates of participants and the salutary effects of Guerins murder on the Irish legal system.
