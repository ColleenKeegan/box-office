"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Theres Life After Man of Steel << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Theres Life After Man of Steel Sony Classics Adam Driver June 19 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Before Midnight directed by Richard Linklater You know those accusatory ticking-time-bomb questions two married people arent supposed to ask each other? Well after two previous installments of complicated bliss (in 1995s Before Sunrise and 2004s Before Sunset) Celine (Julie Delpy) is going there on Jesse (Ethan Hawke). ""Whats the name of the pediatrician?"" ""Would you notice me on a train now -- like right now?"" Tell me you managed not to fuck the girl you met on your book tour That last one wasnt a question. None of them truly are. But one of the glories of this movie is the way Celine expertly corners the slick man shes now married and how Jesses become an expert at evading capture. Another is the way Delpy Hawke and Linklater have managed to build a comedy around the creep of middle age and the way familiarity breeds not only contempt but also security and insecurity. Ive seen this movie three times and each time Im struck at the suspense in the films long complete conversations at how youre able to laugh at the truth of what these two are still trying to do after meeting 18 years ago on a train having an affair and marrying. Installment 3 finds Celine and Jesse (and their twin girls) at the end of a six-week Greek vacation. She doesnt know what to do next with her career. Hes worried about his relationship with the teenage son he had during his first marriage. Theres a wonderful meal with some new friends and a night in a hotel room intended for romance. But were meant to see the other side of romantic comedy the complex frustrated loving place real relationships wind up that the movies rarely confess to being aware of. The films (re)watchability is a testament not simply to the wisdom imparted but to the dramatic musicality of its tone the transparent rapport between the stars and Delpys brilliant understanding that one key to playing matrimonial anger is to add a pinch of sarcasm to cut the sense of oppression. But Hawke is just as good at remaining cool while Delpy overheats. Both actors make you feel why each is good for the other. This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour. In the meantime when Celine reduces male desire to ""kissy-kissy titty-titty pussy snore"" you dont know whether to just say ""Amen"" or call a literary agent. This Is the End directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen No its not cool that Satan here is a dream rapist that Rihanna falls through the earth into the pits of hell or that Emma Watson and her ax have only one scene. But this comedy which Goldberg and Rogen also wrote takes literalism to not-stupid extremes. The years people like me have spent carping about the problems of the so-called bromance often at Rogens expense have produced a movie that wants to call mocking attention to its excesses and privileges and then burn them down. Thats how you wind up with Rogen Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Danny McBride and Craig Robinson playing themselves in an apocalyptic stoner flick that features a tractor beam to the pearly gates. Theyre trapped in Francos mansion while Los Angeles burns around them. Goldberg and Rogen work with a sense of philosophy and morality. They speculate about God and laugh at exorcism movies. A crazed actress slashes a plaster penis in half. The movie is obviously on drugs but theyve given its makers a kind of clarity. Theres wonder here that films with quadruple the effects budget would kill for. The East directed by Zal Batmanglij Is Brit Marling something that can be turned into? She plays Sarah an agent at a D.C. intelligence consulting firm and when her air conditioner of a boss (Patricia Clarkson) sends her undercover to infiltrate an ecoterrorist ring Marling checks into a motel and turns her hair from brown to her usual big blonde. Hollywood seems to want her in brainy girlfriend/daughter parts PhD candidate Daryl Hannah. But she and Batmanglij have a really good art-house thing going. They wrote this movie and its sharper and more convincing than their cult-infiltration movie from last year The Sound of My Voice. Sarah pauses life with her clueless Beltway beau (Jason Ritter) and joins a gang of sexy leftists called the East. They allege to be squatting in an abandoned woodland manse. They claim too that theyre leaderless. But Alexander Skarsgaards holy-hipster beard says ""Come unto men"" and come Sarah does as Ellen Page seethes with bisexual envy. Together they do ""jams"" -- kidnappings mass poisonings -- meant to teach big oil and big pharma a lesson. Will Sarah bring them all down? Or will she go East? The mix of radicalism naivete and forest-bound sex flirts with the absurd. But Marling and Batmanglij have an interest in rituals and devotion and the accompanying exploitation of belief. As artists theyre not dissimilar from an idiosyncratically talented filmmaker like Shane Carruth. But they appear to enjoy the power of storytelling. Carruth wants to obfuscate story and frustrate comprehension and for no appreciable aim really. Marling and Batmanglij dont fear or resent entertainment They make effective thrillers. With each successive collaboration you can feel them slowly coming in from the margins. If they reach a major studio and bigger budget they could be the right kind of dangerous. Frances Ha directed by Noah Baumbach How do you make a watchable film about a tedious tiresome person? Frances (Greta Gerwig) -- the 27-year-old underemployed dancer at the center of this movie -- insults freeloads and hijacks dinner parties. She has only the vaguest sense that shes not cut out for most of what she pursues. Her narcissism is vividly tedious. Another movie would have tried to mature her or turn her into a joke. But Baumbach loves loves loves her. He wrote the script with Gerwig whose flaky fuzziness tends to have this effect on directors. Baumbach happens to have been the most affected Theyre a real-life couple. Maybe this is an older artier cousin of Girls -- Adam Driver does a saner version of his HBO self but Baumbach and Gerwig are focused on the bond between Frances and her best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner) and the way friendships change when life changes. (With her dark features long face and general sourness Sumner looks like something on loan from a Mike Leigh movie.) The aim with these characters is more to get toward some kind of truth than likability. This isnt a deep film and the ponderous argot padding it (""Tell me the story of us"" says one character to the other; ""21st century? What up"") suggests the friction in the difference between their ages (hes 14 years older). The sense of place (Brooklyn Paris Poughkeepsie) and black-and-white photography almost excuse the forced authenticity. This is not the cinematic rock and roll of his cri de divorce The Squid and the Whale or the socially apocalyptic smoke signal of Greenberg. Often when a director adores his star it results in fetish abuse nausea or deification. (With Nicolas Roeg and Theresa Russell it was all four all the time.) Baumbach is just besotted. One of the happiest sights youll see all summer is a montage of Gerwig running and twirling across Chinatown with David Bowies ""Modern Love"" on the soundtrack. Baumbach sees beauty marks on Frances where a lot of us see warts. The Internship directed by Shawn Levy In which Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn lose their analog sales jobs land summer gigs at Google and luxuriate in all the free stuff at their disposal. Wilson chases Rose Byrne. Vaughn chases any human who will laugh at him. He wrote this movie with Jared Stern. His bad-luck vulnerability needs a movie brave enough to do more than laugh it off. Its almost touching watching him try to talk his way out of having to study for a test. The comedy here is supposed to come from the competition for permanent employment with entitled freaks and geeks half their age and in that regard its a lousy sitcom that doubles as one of the most shameless commercials Ive ever seen. (At this point of course it might be no more so than Titanic was an ad for water.) Whats distressing is the movies applying romantic-comedy plot points to a megabusiness boy gets corporation. You dont need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA.

"The Internship - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Internship Posted by Christy Lemire on June 7 2013 2 Comments 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13 for sexuality some crude humor partying and language. Running time 119 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. ""The Internship"" reunites Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson stars of the smash hit ""Wedding Crashers"" with glimmers of their old banter and none of the bite. Similar to Eddie Murphys hard right turn from daring and profane comedy to family-friendly romps Vaughn and Wilson have gone all soft and gooey here. Maybe its an inevitable product of getting older and having to adapt to survive; maybe they genuinely wanted to try on the father-figure role for size. Either way its entirely too safe and not enough fun keeping it squarely within the confines of director Shawn Levys oeuvre (the ""Night at the Museum"" movies ""Real Steel""). Essentially a two-hour-long promo for Google - as if the ubiquitous search engine needed it - ""The Internship"" finds Vaughn and Wilson out of work as longtime watch salesmen when the iPhone makes their product obsolete according to their no-nonsense boss (a woefully underused John Goodman). This is actually a rare insightful nugget within the premise; the rest of the movie is feel-good fluff. Vaughns fast-talking Billy McMahon (as if there were any other kind of Vaughn character) tracks down Wilsons Nick Campbell at the mattress store where hes stuck working _ the best scene in the whole movie thanks to Will Ferrell as Wilsons boss. Billy tells his longtime pal hes lined up an interview for them ... to intern at Google.  If theyre accepted for the summer theyll have to compete against hundreds of brilliant and far more technologically savvy college students for the chance at full-time gigs. Naturally they get in and find themselves functioning as tried-and-true fish out of water in this familiar formula. Also totally unsurprisingly the Google campus itself is depicted as a rainbow-hued Shangri-La by the bay with sand volleyball courts and bike sharing free snacks and nap pods. Immediately Billy and Nick get lumped in with the other misfits including perky cosplay girl Neha (a hugely likable Tiya Sircar) and meek homeschooler Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael). Among the other supporting cast Max Minghella is the arbitrary bully of the intern class Aasif Mandvi is the programs condescending coordinator and Rose Byrne is the uptight overworked Google exec with whom Nick has a thoroughly unbelievable romance. (This needless subplot seriously reeks of pandering to female filmgoers.) A few scattered laughs aside ""The Internship"" is mostly way too lame and predictable with the outcasts banding together to beat the smug shoo-ins. Its also a good solid 20 minutes too long with one or two challenges too many one or two montages too many. Individual scenes that might have had some clever notions in them drag on as well. The night Billy and Nicks team has a spontaneous outing on the Google bus to San Francisco -- and ends up at the tamest strip club in the history of mankind in this decidedly PG-13 affair - features a couple of amusing ideas but then feels as if it will never end. Its as if everyone involved including Vaughn as co-screenwriter was so enamored of their precious comic gems that they couldnt possibly jettison any of them for the sake of lean and lively storytelling. Vaughn and Wilson still share an easy chemistry despite the weakened material. The actors retain a firm grasp on their respective personae Vaughn is the brash but charismatic smart-ass whos always hustling while Wilson is the laid-back and wryly sardonic sidekick who woos the women with sweetness. No one is stretching very far or wandering outside of his comfort zone. But the edge that made ""Wedding Crashers"" such a thrill - the selfishness and slight meanness that made these guys such a crackling team - has been obliterated with a few simple keystrokes.

Considered using Google? If you havent we may have located the audience for The Internship a two-hour celebration of the technology behemoth masquerading as a jaunty reunion for the appealing oafs of Wedding Crashers. As disenfranchised dinosaurs Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn bumble their way through a Google internship program for sneering graduates the film repeatedly halts the hijinks to admire the companys generous corporate ethos and colourfully casual work environment. Its as dispiritingly naff as those Mitchell and Webb Apple ads from a few years back but at least those admitted being ads. Its a testament to the duos jazzy comic chemistry that they wring some laughs from this dated frankly sinister premise. The free-association webcam interview that scores them the internship in the first place is inspired and theres genuine sweetness to their inevitable bonding with a team of fellow social outcasts united in competition against Max Minghellas oily alpha male. Only in Hollywood however could a company diversity policy exist to boost the fortunes of two middle-aged white guys.

Grade B- Two guys who peddle upscale watches face the death of the salesman only to become the life of the party in this sweet uninspired comic fantasy set mostly on a cunning replica of the Google campus in Mountain View. Thats where Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) find a new focus after the timepiece company folds and they become Googles oldest summer interns. Theyre the least likely to succeed - or they would be if everything about this film didnt shout ""feel-good movie."" Vaughn came up with the plot himself and wrote the script with Jared Stern. Couldnt Stern or director Shawn Levy have cut some of the lines in which other characters tell Billy what a great fellow he is? The film puts some roadblocks in our heroes way like Billys technical ineptitude and muddled concentration. But from the moment he and Nick hit campus theres little doubt that these nice guys will finish first. Vaughn neednt sentimentalize his characters to get an audience on his side. Hes a strong immediate presence. Even when his characters affect a blase attitude his body language says the opposite of ""been there done that"" or ""whatever."" Hes convincing as a man of appetite He makes you feel the pleasure Billy takes in Googles free cafeteria. He teams so well with his ""Wedding Crashers"" costar Owen Wilson because theyre perfectly matched opposites. Wilson has turned being laid-back and drawly into a comic style. It makes sense that Wilsons Nick is the one who tries out Googles ""nap pods."" In ""The Internship"" Vaughn takes several leaps but doesnt always nail the landings. Its daring for this former embodiment of hip to play an out-of-it older man who lacks the wired reflexes and pop-culture references of the younger interns. But for each wacky stroke that works such as Billy using the storyline of ""Flashdance"" as an uplifting piece of folklore two hit the ground stumbling. The feeblest gags depend on Billy and Nick not knowing what a computer bug is or who the X-men are and Billy repeatedly saying hes going ""on the line."" You wonder ""Are they 45 -- or 90?"" Its intriguing to think of older ""people persons"" making better connections between products and users than any plugged-in youth. And its enjoyable to watch Vaughn and Wilson improvise - as if theyre playing catch with thought balloons. But the script doesnt give them lines or bits of business that would make their comedy memorable. Even when a scene showcases one of their particular talents its apt to be amiable nothing more. Wilson gets the sole romantic interest as Nick woos a Google executive (Rose Byrne) who in classic cornball fashion looks even more beautiful when she takes off her glasses. He amusingly riffs on the severity that he finds oddly seductive but all the subplot does is confirm his straggly charm and Byrnes pert prettiness. Theyre a match made in limbo. Josh Gad works calm eccentric wonders into the small part of a resident genius who filters the world through his headphones. Josh Brener as Lile the bespectacled Google prodigy who believes in Billy and Nick gives off a semi-neurotic semi-eager comic glow like a cross between the young Woody Allen and the young Matthew Broderick. He and Aasif Mandvi as the officious interns coordinator add much-needed quirk when the film turns into ""Celebrity Apprentice - Google Edition"" complete with a rosy vision of the corporate host. Liles squad of misfits must face off against rival teams in reality-show-style challenges. Its breezy fun to see Vaughn and Wilson play older brother to a college boy who is too cool to live (Dylan OBrien) and a college girl who is not-as-hot-as-she-pretends (Tiya Sircar). Unfortunately the script is so banal it treats a San Francisco strip club as their most liberating experience - an R-rated field trip for PG-13 characters. You miss the go-for-broke talent of Will Ferrell who early on brings a welcome blast of raunch to his cameo as a butt-fixated mattress salesman. He displays comic fearlessness in a film that otherwise wants to be as comforting as a tea cozy.

Apparently made in partnership with Google the film stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as two down-on-their-luck Gen X salesmen who get an internship at the tech giant and have to compete against an army of code-happy millennials for coveted jobs. Based solely on that premise the thing feels like it could write itself. When you see the movie you suspect that maybe it has. We think of Vaughn and Wilson as some kind of established comedy duo but aside from cameos and bit parts Wedding Crashers -- eight years ago -- was the only movie in which they really worked together as a comedy team. (They were also in Starsky amp; Hutch but that was more Wilson and Ben Stillers show.) Maybe thats because theyre both variations on a similar type -- the overconfident all-American charmer -- and thus more effective when cast next to dweeby everymen like Ben Stiller. But they do have different styles Vaughns usually the imposing motormouth while Wilson plays the soft laid-back type. Wedding Crashers exploited that difference for all it was worth to hilarious results. The Internship does that a bit too but here their characters feel mostly interchangeable. When we first meet Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) theyre watch salesmen smooth-talking a store owner only to be told that their company has shut down. Not knowing where to turn in an economy that wont have them they score an (unlikely) internship at Google where they have to join a team of young social outcasts and compete against other teams of interns through a series of challenges -- everything from a Quidditch match to designing a hot new app. Only the winners will have jobs at the end of the summer. Its basically Old School only instead of an imaginary stuffed-shirt academy we have real-life corporate branding -- and all the narrative compromises that come with that. The whole Google tie-in is definitely a little creepy. Its not so much that the company is presented as the coolest place ever to work what with its free commissary and its nap rooms and its fun colorful campus; all that actually makes sense within the context of a story in which our heroes are desperate to land jobs there. But Google and its authority figures seem so frustratingly infallible. Even Aasif Mandvi excellent as the stern taskmaster in charge of the interns and of running the contest is essentially playing a firm but fair type Though the film has some fun at his expense hes less Crusty Old Dean and more Severus Snape. Still these guys are so damned likable that its hard not to root for them. As expected Billy and Nick learn to bond with their young dorky teammates and everybody teaches everybody else a thing or two and mild chuckles ensue. There isnt even much conflict or suspense; Max Minghella is mostly wasted as the sneering entitled British-accented leader of an opposing team of interns. Occasionally though a bit of realism peeks through Theres genuine pathos to Vaughns portrayal of a guy who has the social skills to sell anything but finds himself out of step with the compulsive tech-savvy world around him. You wish the film would do more with that but well youre looking in the wrong movie for true character development. Wilsons character is even less defined; his main gig here is to romance a workaholic Google honcho played by the lovely Rose Byrne. They do have one terrific scene together when he takes her out on a date and upon her request presents her with a diverse medley of faux-bad-date experiences Hes charming throughout but amid all his jerky banter you get the sense that hes probably been that guy at various points in his life. Theres so much soul to the scene that it feels like its been airlifted in from a far better film. The rest of the movie is a halfhearted mess. A scene where Billy and Nick take their introverted socially maladjusted teammates to a rowdy strip club drags on forever with montage upon montage of them boozing it up of college kids discovering the pleasures of purchased flesh etc. Its as if the filmmakers couldnt come up with any other bonding scenes for these characters so they just made one scene extra-long hoping we wouldnt notice. The laziness is at times breathtaking. The Internship is a hard movie to hate but its not that easy to like either.

(Phil Bray) B The Internship Genre Comedy; Starring Rose Byrne Will Ferrell Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson; Director Shawn Levy; Release Date Wide 06/07/2013; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted June 25 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT In the rude antic and brazenly funny Wedding Crashers (2005) Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn played overgrown arrested-development cases who won us over from their very first whopping lie onward. At the time the two actors were already in their mid-30s but they were still able to mount a bad-boy generational assault against all things civil and decent. The Internship reunites Wilson with his smarm-that-looks-like-sweetness (or is it the other way around?) and Vaughn with his disaffected fast patter. The audience is still rooting for them -- only this time the two are playing the older stodgy guys. Theyre Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn) designer-watch salesmen who lose their careers in what seems like the tick of a second hand. Tossed into a dead-end job market without any real prospects they talk their way into an internship on the sprawling buzzy Silicon Valley campus of Google where they?re pitted against a bunch of brainiac 20-year-olds who live and breathe technology and don?t get any of the pair?s pathetically ancient pop-culture references (Stalag 17 anyone?). Directed by the workmanlike Shawn Levy (who made the Night at the Museum films and Date Night) the movie is a halfway clever cookie-cutter culture-clash comedy but there?s a reason that it lacks the highs of Wedding Crashers The Internship puts us on the side of those who are trying to hold on to respectability not tear it down. The movie was made with the cooperation of Google which is why its basic attitude toward the search engine that changed the world is one of unironic reverence. True the place can come off looking a bit goofy and obsessive. The leader of the internship program is Mr. Chetty (The Daily Shows Aasif Mandvi) a po-faced corporate guru who lights up whenever he extols the virtues of ethereal concepts like ""Googliness."" And when the army of interns gets divvied up into a dozen competing teams only one of which will ultimately land jobs there Nick and Bill are stuck with the social outliers that no one else wants ? the geeks among geeks. They?re led by Lile (Josh Brener) a shrimpy horn-rimmed genius who tries to fit in by saying things like ""fo shizzle."" (Hes clearly been saying that since he was about five.) The actors cast as Google interns are likable and mildly amusing in a Revenge of the Nerds 2013 way. But I wish that at least one of them had been given a major voice a way of making the tech banter seem hilariously cool. The likeliest candidate would have been Stuart (Dylan OBrien) with his sullen stare and open contempt for our heroes but the character loses his superior edge over time which is the movies mistake. Its up to Nick and Bill to teach these brilliant losers how to live and what that comes down to is showing them that it?s fun to let go and do Tequila shots and dance like crazy and hit on people. How rebellious The Internship was written by Vaughn and Jared Stern and it?s got little jabs of wit like the scene in which Nick and Bill are duped into addressing a bald instructor in a wheelchair as ""Professor Charles Xavier"" (he is not pleased). A lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element dont need to be opposed; they can and should work hand in hand. That?s a nice message (and it?s certainly a swell advertisement for Google) but it?s not a funny message. The Internship gets so caught up in healing the generational divide that it?s ostensibly about -- the analog dudes vs. the digital kids -- that the movie ends up being just a pleasant collection of mild laughs. It needed more spin more Googliness.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 444pm on Thursday Jun. 06 2013 Thursday Jun. 06 2013 Friday Jun. 07 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram From the very first moments of The Internship the buddy comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson its obvious exactly where itfs going. Two washed-up salesmen on the wrong side of 40 vie with a bunch of mouthy millennials for a job at Google. If you cant guess that the geezers will teach the youngsters something about real life while the kids school them about Google Chrome well youfve never seen a movie before.But as the saying goes its the getting there thatfs half the fun. The Internship doesnt break any new comedic ground and it will evaporate from memory upon leaving the darkened theater. But its an amiable occasionally laugh-out-loud fish-out-of-water tale that gently mocks our modern technological age while simultaneously embracing it (and giving a big sloppy kiss to Google).Best buds Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) find themselves out on the street when the watch company they work for goes belly up. After fooling around on the Internet Billy finagles a way to get them into a Google internship program. A lucky few will be offered a full-time job at the end of it.But there are two problems neither Billy or Nick knows anything about technology and theyre twice the age of all the other interns.Their very presence and incompetence enrages a snotty Brit intern (Max Minghella). A boo-hiss villain if there ever was one (he does everything but twirl a moustache) he takes it upon himself to kick them out of the running.Meanwhile Billy and Nick team up with other intern outcasts -- who may know a lot about computers but little about social interaction -- to try to outwit their competitors and the no-nonsense manager who oversees the program Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi). The Internship is The Bad News Bears with smartphones.As directed by Shawn Levy ( Night at the Museum) and written by Vaughn and Jared Stern The Internship offers a broad canvas for its two stars -- last together in The Wedding Crashers in 2005. They riff off each other with abandon. One of the moviefs early highlights is their hilarious video-conference interview with a couple of earnest Google geeks (one of whom is played by B.J. Novak from The Office).Once on the corporate campus Nick flirts with an exec (Rose Byrne) who at first is cool to his boorish charms. While the romantic element feels a bit tacked on and isnft as funny as the main narrative itfs nevertheless a showcase for the shaggy-haired Wilson persona.The movie also plays up all the cliches of the Google workplace -- free food sleep pods and co-workers who all look like theyfre in indie bands. Yet itfs never critical of Google or even mentions controversies over privacy. (Be sure to stay for the end credits and a clever take-off on Google-isms).But no one goes to a Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson comedy for a lecture. They go to see a couple of guys who are on their comedic game and thats just what the two deliver. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

At area theaters. Is the Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson comedy ""The Internship"" derivative -- and not in the advanced-math sort of way? Absolutely. Many misfit sagas and fish-out-of-water yarns have been parsed by director Shawn Levy and writers Vaughn and Jared Stern. Is the story that sends two ace but out-of-work salesmen to the Google campus for a coveted internship the longest example of product placement ever? Why yes yes it is. So why then is it so darn fun despite its fondness for the obvious and penchant for pandering? In a word Chemistry the kind Wilson and Vaughn have with each other but also the long-standing typically good-natured (even when naughty) vibe they share with audiences. Is this what it felt like to sign on again and again in years gone by for yet another Jerry Lewis-Dean Martin romp? Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) are good at what they do. Only what they do selling high-end watches is a thing of the past. John Goodman portrays the boss who dissolves his business without telling his salesmen and heads to retirement in Miami. At 6-foot-5 Vaughn towers over Wilson. Billy even tousles Nicks blond mop after he rescues him from a job working for his sisters boyfriend. ""The Internship"" begins funny and lets up only slightly once the duo are ensconced at Google HQ where the end game feels more familiar. Nick and Billys arrival to Googles vast California campus makes them men of a sort walking amid whizkids. The hook of the Google internship pits teams against each other with a summer of brainiac challenges. The prize jobs for the team members. Its ""Survivor 22 Googleplex."" Or as Billy quips aptly ""The Hunger Games."" Of course the first people Nick and Billy must sell themselves to are their reluctant teammates. Neha (Tiya Sircar) is a good girl with fantasies of being otherwise. Stewart (Dylan OBrien) is an overly connected/disconnected cynic. Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael) is the flinching product of Tiger Mom abuse. Consider them a team of bad code bears. Josh Brenner sweetly captures the nervous vision of fourth-year programmer Lyle the ""leader"" of the newbies or ugh ""Nooglers."" Aasif Mandvi does prickly work as Mr. Chetty head of the internship program. He looks on at the doings of Team Lyle with chilly reservation. Outsmarted in ""The Social Network"" Max Minghella gets to go evil geek here as he embraces the role of condescending fellow intern Graham. From the winningly absurd use of an Alanis Morissette hit to an inspirational pitch that celebrates a little welding girl who just wants to dance theres no paucity of pleasing pop-culture nods. Not surprisingly ""The Internship"" is better on camaraderie than romance. The fellas chipper repartee is more nimble than the stuff written for the female characters. Rose Byrne who can be wonderfully agile in comedies is mildly wasted here as uptight Google manager Dana the foil for Nicks charm offensive. The comedy teases some fairly authentic anxieties about 40-somethings and their evolved counterparts who are tormented with the sense their employment picture is highly competitive and utterly bleak. Throughout ""The Internship"" the company that created the most successful search engine is ever present from Billys late-night computer search for ""Jobs for people with few skills"" to the parting shot of the Googleplex in Mountain View Calif.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Phil Bray) Photo Phil Bray Mining economic misery for laughs 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Internship"" is exactly what it seems to be a comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson that provides two or three opportunities to laugh and more than a few chances to feel a mild flutter of amusement. There are moments of fake uplift in which one guy bucks up the other with a pep talk that the audience is supposed to register as absurd and yet feel something. And there is exactly one well-placed f-word because two would get an R-rating. So this is the usual a pair of genuinely funny guys struggling with a weak script but what makes ""The Internship"" a little bit different is that its all about Google -- about two unemployed salesman in their 40s who get an internship at the company. Along the way the movie touches on a few things that are true and disturbing about todays economy that middle-aged people are being cast into poverty as technology wipes out their jobs; and that young people entering the economy are fearful and dispirited wondering if theyre ever going to make a decent living. Its great when comedies deal in serious issues and yet not so great when they deal with them in dumb or insensitive ways that miss the point or trivialize the problems theyre seeking to depict. More Information  Review""The Internship""Rated PG-13 for sexuality some crude humor partying and languageLength 119 minutes Excellent  Good  Fair  Poor In the case of ""The Internship"" its easy to imagine some people being offended by it Here we have a comedy co-written by a wealthy movie star (Vaughn) that celebrates entry-level employment at one of the richest companies in the world as the height of human aspiration like some corporate version of peasants being relieved of the pox by the touch of a medieval lord. If you were to believe ""The Internship"" all you need to thrive in todays economy is gumption and a willingness to travel across the country to work for free. Just think with a little luck you might be one of the 5 percent to get a permanent job from out of the intern pool As for the other 95 percent why think about them? Theyre not exactly going to be part of any happy ending. Was a movie like this ever made during any previous bad economy? The Great Depression equivalent might be the story of a pair of unemployed guys competing against hundreds to go work on Henry Fords assembly line. But no such a movie was never made -- and could not exist -- because in no previous America would turning yourself into a cog in somebody elses machine be considered an achievement worthy of celebration. And in no previous America would it be considered a victory if 95 percent of your fellows were still left on the street. Rather the Great Depression cinema made heroes of gangsters con men and fast talking individualists guys who chose survival by not fitting in. Still hardly anyone will look at ""The Internship"" in such bleak terms. Its meant to be fun and it almost is. But if you do feel a little queasy when you think about it later the reason is simple The movie just assumes as a matter of course that people are totally defeated without energy or hope -- and then it asks you to feel OK about that. As for the rest Vaughn is blustery and oblivious Wilson is bumbling and sincere and they become part of a team of interns -- all in their 20s -- competing against other teams in various categories such as sales app creation and customer service. Again this is a comedy but the comedy is not that they should even want to succeed in such things but that rather they might not be good enough to make the grade. Accordingly ""The Internship"" just might be the saddest movie of 2013. That few will realize this makes it even sadder. mlasallesfchronicle.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Summer Sale Up to 50% off + free shipping Womens Dresses at Nordstrom Rack Up to 89% off from 10 +...

This time instead of a wedding theyre crashing the corporate precincts of Google where they jawbone their way into internships after the bottom drops out of their salesmen gigs. Theres a potentially good comedy to be made about old-school guys trying to make a go of it in a youth-dominated digital marketplace but director Shawn Levy and screenwriter Jared Stern overdose on moronic excursions including an outing with the two guys and their 20-something fellow interns (the company calls them ""Nooglers"") at a strip club.

"The Internship leaves us searching for laughs review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Internship leaves us searching for laughs reviewThe Internship is a Google commercial wrapped in a weak buddy comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. June 7 2013The InternshipStarring Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Rose Byrne Aasif Mandvi and Max Minghella. Directed by Shawn Levy. 120 minutes. Opens June 7 at major theatres. PGThe Internship is a big wet kiss to Google wrapped in a buddy comedy that asks us to believe that nobody over 40 knows anything about computers or the online universe.Middle-aged salesmen Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) are analogue dudes in a digital world; luxury wristwatch shillers who work the same tag-team roles they used in their last and far more successful onscreen pairing 2005s Wedding Crashers.Article Continued BelowFired by their boss (John Goodman) these dinosaurs are left to lumber towards unemployment when Nick makes a brief stop to try working at his brother-in-laws mattress store run by Will Ferrell in an uncredited cameo and the films most amusing scene -- and only mildly funny at that.Inspired by a Google search -- the introduction of a film-wide product placement that often hijacks the movie and turns it into a commercial for the pure awesomeness that is all things Google -- Billy signs them up for an unpaid internship tryout that he figures will lead to stellar careers.Its the oldsters vs. the know-it-all nerds on Googles Mountain View Calif. campus where Vaughn and Wilson do their familiar shtick as Slick Willy and the Butterscotch Stallion. Except Vaughns northward-creeping hairline and Wilsons evolution from stallion to lovable sheepdog demonstrates that the times they are a-changin.Its good to see these two back together onscreen offering their brand of ridiculous back and forth -- say on the merits of using Alanis Morissette on a motivational music mix -- reminding us of the chemistry they have when the stars properly align.But these are rare events. More often we see them dispensing enthusiastic advice and wacky metaphors and crowing about the free food nap pods and general awesomeness on tap at Google central.Hooked up with the unloved of the campus and toiling under the thumb of humour-deficient Google taskmaster Mr. Chetty (Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi) the groups are assigned team-building challenges in a race for a handful of coveted jobs.The world is a different place than the free-for-all that awaited graduating Boomers the earnest techies inform the oldsters. College grads swarm the few jobs that pop up as embodied in this contest by weaselly Graham (Max Minghella from the internet flick that stands as the polar opposite of this frothy effort The Social Network).Attempts to add some sort of tension to this predictable farce are so out of place as to be ridiculous. Billys fixation (ad nauseam) with Flashdance gets old very fast. A game of Quidditch replaces the tried-and-true football metaphor but whats with the trip to a strip club where the interns are introduced to G-rated debauchery that would be at home on the Disney Channel?We fear its only a matter of time before Billy starts with Vaughns trademark efforts to nail everything in sight when he has a sunrise heart-to-heart with a saucy twenty-something intern (Tiya Sircar). Instead he and Nick ladle out folksy wisdom and plenty of b.s. in their attempts to maximize the teams ""Googliness.""Romance is wisely left to Nick whose attempts to woo Aussie Google exec Dana (Rose Byrne) leads to a charming restaurant scene that shows Wilsons still got it.With a script penned by Vaughn -- who came up with the idea after seeing a 60 Minutes segment on Google HQs workplace Nirvana -- and Jared Stern (The Watch Mr. Poppers Penguins) and vanilla direction by Montreals Shawn Levy (Date Night Night at the Museum franchise) The Internship gets more indulgent chuckles than outright laughter.""Youre too young to be this cynical"" Nick tells one of the young interns.Im not. The Internship is a disappointing comedy masquerading as a Google ad the kind of thing a certain generation might have described as selling out.Read more about GoogleThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 07 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 07 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Shawn Levy Written by Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern Starring Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2013 Country USA Language English Eight years after Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson co-starred in The Wedding Crashers a breakthrough R-rated comedy hit that predated Knocked Up and The Hangover theyre back in The Internship milder and middle-aged as a couple of behind-the-times unemployed watch salesman who crash the Google internship program. Though by no means a good movie The Internship floats along for fairly well for about half its length thanks to the easy interplay between the two stars and a certain melancholic topicality. Multimedia The Internship The official trailer Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn) are the kind of salesmen given to motivational tapes expense-account dinners and affirmation-filled conversation until they discover in the middle of an expensive meal to pitch to a client that their company has gone bankrupt. Their bumptious boss (John Goodman of course) tells them that theyre dinosaurs in the digital age where kids check their smartphones to know the time.Soon after Billy gets dumped by his live-in girlfriend when the bank forecloses on his house. The single Nick briefly lands a job with his sisters boyfriend a grossly skeezy mattress salesmen (an uncredited Will Ferrell). But defeat and humiliation dont last long for these irrepressible dreamers.Billy decides that the digital world must be conquered from within. He puts in an application for both of them to become interns at Google competing with tech-savvy college kids less than half their age. Closer in spirit to Meatballs or Revenge of the Nerds than the frosty cool of The Social Network there is at least a fragment of an interesting idea here. As salesmen b.s. artists glad-handers and fun-loving fools Nick and Billy have developed social skills unknown to the blinkered computer kids who now rule their world.One indication of the power of the digital media is that The Internship is essentially a feature-length commercial for Google with a comedy attached. The search-engine company collaborated extensively with the filmmakers and retained control over its image in the movie. (""I think the reason why we got involved in that is that computer science has a marketing problem"" Google co-founder Larry Page said at a conference last month. ""Were the nerdy curmudgeons."")The notion that Google has a marketing problem seems almost funny in itself. No doubt the movie sells the brand hard. The Google campus is portrayed as a fantasy land of colourful bicycles sleeping pods tunnel slides and free cafeteria food where managers like workaholic Dana (Rose Byrne) are devoted to making the world a better place. Googles diversity program is so inclusive they even have space for a couple of middle-aged white guys with no academic credentials or tech experience.The more obviously invented elements include a competition among teams of interns for employment in what Nick calls a ""mental Hunger Games"" to land full-time jobs. Immediately Nick and Billy discover that they have an enemy the condescending Graham (Max Minghella) who scoops up the most brilliant kids for his team. Nick and Billy are left with the ""outlier"" misfits under the supervision of socially backward 23-year-old manager Lyle (Josh Brener). The team includes glumly cynical Stuart (Dylan OBrien); Yo-Yo (Tobit Raphael) the home-schooled victim of an Asian Tiger Mom and South Asian wallflower Neha (Tiya Sircar) - in essence theyre variations on the same nerd waiting for the boisterous middle-aged men to crack them out of the shells. Meanwhile Nick pursues the frosty Google manager Dana while Billy works to charm the interns imperious supervisor Mr. Chetty (a very funny Aasif Mandvi). Count on them both to close the deal.Even more predictability The Internship at almost two hours suffers from redundancy. While Wilsons feminine seductiveness and Vaughns macho warmth are familiar fun Nick and Billy arent sufficiently distinguished as characters to raise dramatic stakes and director Shawn Levy seems happy to let the stars banter roll on.Other ideas should have been pared back or scrapped - the dated X-Men and Flashdance references and particularly a misguided sequence in a San Francisco strip bar that seems the worlds least likely place to help a socially awkward group of kids to bond. The shame here is that the Google collaborators couldnt develop an app to help the filmmakers refine their search for laughs.

Shawn Levy seems to be living the dream. The cruddy kid comedy ""Big Fat Liar"" the unwanted remakes of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""The Pink Panther"" two overstuffed yet underwritten ""Night at the Museum"" flicks -- those are the credits folks. Yet the movies attract some stars -- Steve Martin Ben Stiller Paul Giamatti. They often make money and spawn sequels. And because of that Levy stays employed and busy. ""The Internship"" the latest takes Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and casts them as a couple of glad-handing salesmen buddies who are both fired -- on the same day. They have no immediate prospects and it seems few marketable skills. So they decide to change their lives completely -- and move out to Silicon Valley for make-or-break internships at Google. Its a thin idea for a movie and its developed predictably. Wilsons character gets a romantic interest. Vaughn gets to do some silly sports stuff. They both get a tough boss and a snobby competitor out to sabotage their chances. What they dont get is a movie that really goes anywhere let alone challenges its stars to really do anything. Which perhaps is the secret reason Levy works so regularly -- hes the Go-Along Guy the filmmaker a big comedian hires when he wants somebody to just stay out of his way. I got this camera boy. You just keep it in focus and watch the master work. Lots of comics do it -- it explains most of Adam Sandlers films and Eddie Murphys career. But it hurts the movies. Comics need an audience and if a director isnt really present its like playing to an empty room. Theres no feedback -- and therefore no way to tell whats working. Some things work in ""The Internship."" Wilson has a naturally down-home dopey charm -- hes like a surfer cowboy. And Vaughn is his own perpetual-motion machine of riffs and references and made-up slang -- all these years after ""Swingers"" babies and hes still money. But after a promising guest-star-studded start -- John Goodman as their bellowing old boss Will Ferrell as a loathsome new one -- they go out to Google. And the film becomes just one big product placement with callow co-stars and by-the-numbers plotting. Theres a desperate attempt to get back some of the old Vaughn-and-Wilson ""Wedding Crashers"" vibe by taking them out to a strip club but the PG-13 rating keeps things from getting as nasty as they want to be and Levys decision to film a big fight scene lit by strobe lights just makes it into a confusing slide show. After a few more obvious complications and a lot of broad stereotyping -- overachieving Chinese kid snotty British boy socially awkward Indian girl -- the whole thing comes to a predictable end. But at least it seems a final one -- there are no loose threads or threats of a sequel. Which is just as well. Levy has to get that next ""Night at the Museum"" movie ready. Ratings note The film contains some strong language comic violence alcohol abuse and sensuality. The Internship (PG-13) Fox (119 min.) Directed by Shawn Levy. With Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson.

"Internship The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; internship-the ) Internship The (United States 2013) June 06 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps The Internship might have worked eight years ago had it been released in the wake of the unexpected success of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilsons Wedding Crashers. (Emphasis on the word perhaps - this movie wouldnt have been any better in 2005 just perhaps less out of step with current movie goers habits.) In 2013 however everything about it feels stale the actors the story the comedy everything. And to make matters worse that everything goes on for an interminable two hours. On one level The Internship plays out like a 120-minute commercial for Google. The screenplay is peppered with praise. The Google campus is presented as a tech Mecca and is referred to on more than one occasion (and without a hint of sarcasm) as ""Eden."" Apparently the price of obtaining Googles buy-in to the project and permission to shoot on-site was to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. No messing around with Mr. In-Between. Whats strange however is that Google rightfully viewed as a forward-thinking company would latch onto a dinosaur like The Internship. Not only is this a lackluster movie but its not likely to be exceptionally popular which makes its value as an image-enhancer somewhat questionable. One of the biggest problems associated with The Internship lies in its inability to reconcile the desire to lampoon and satirize the ""nerd culture"" with a veneration of it. The Internship is chock full of stereotypes and familiar geek tropes. (Although it should be noted pretty much every woman in the film fits into one of two categories hot and hotter.) The movie never figures out whether it wants to be laughing at or with the nerds and as a result ends up doing neither. The Internship contains few characters - no real attempts are made to humanize the techies. That would apparently require too much effort and would diminish the ""comedic"" potential inherent in making fun of the socially awkward stereotypes. The story focuses on expert salesman Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) who unexpectedly find themselves unemployed and at loose ends in their mid-40s. Deciding to reinvent themselves they apply for internships at Google. Once accepted they learn that the way Google decides whos worthy of a job offer is by breaking the interns into teams and having those teams compete against one another. The winners get the jobs. The losers go home. Of course since no one wants to have two over-the-hill non-tech savvy men on their team Billy and Nick are lumped together with the other outcasts the dour cynical Stuart (Dylan OBrien); the pretty sex-obsessed Neha (Tiya Sircar); the shy home-schooled Yo-Yo (Tophit Raphael); and the team leader uber nerd Lyle (Josh Brener). Their main opposition is led by a petty vindictive snob (Max Minghella) whose ""win at all costs"" attitude is most ""un-Google-like."" The Internship plays out like a hybrid fish-out-of-water story and sports movie although it doesnt do either especially well. In what might be viewed as an attempt to show geek cred it gamely references numerous touchstones Harry Potter (theres a game of quidditch) X-Men Game of Thrones Star Wars and so forth. (Curiously the biggest shout-out is to Flashdance. No Jennifer Beals but ""What a Feeling"" is used.) Screenwriters Vaughn and Jared Stern who toss around ""techie terms"" without understanding a thing about how to use them confuse condescension for sympathy. The nerdiest character Lyle isnt likeably awkward hes unbearably annoying. Neha is every geeks dream girl; Im not sure someone like her really exists. Of course the non-geeks Billy and Nick come across admirably. They bond grow and learn things. Unfortunately Vince Vaughn plays Billy pretty much the way he plays every other character (fast-talking slick insensitive). And Owen Wilson is trying to get by on boyish charisma thats well past its sell-by date. Director Shawn Levy whose credits include the unforgiveable Pink Panther remake and the inexplicably successful Night at the Museum proves that not only is his sense of comedic timing questionable but his skills at developing romantic subplots is downright awful. There are no fewer than three of these in The Internship and the film might be half-star better without any of them. The worst offender and the one with the most screen time inflicts a Rose Byrne/Owen Wilson pairing on audiences. These two couldnt generate heat at midday in the Sahara. Their interaction isnt just infantile its painful. Whether or not Google got a good deal out of The Internship is open to debate. One would think their brand is well enough known that this kind of publicity isnt necessary. The company itself comes across well even if the same cant be said of much else. As a nerd I found The Internship insulting. As a movie-goer I found it offensive. Its two hours of tedium rescued only occasionally by barely amusing humor that rarely pushes the tame PG-13 envelope. Give The Internship a failing grade and send everyone involved back to school.

But in truth hes been hustling of late having taken up screenwriting and penned three recent snark-coms including this dispiriting reteam with fellow Wedding Crasher Owen Wilson. Vaughns Billy is a smooth-talking salesman who alongside his chummy partner Nick finds himself professionally obsolete. As quickly as you can mutter ""high concept"" the tech-illiterate duo charm their way into age-inappropriate internships at Google where thanks to old-school moxie and Hollywood shorthand they show nerds how to party and become patron saints of second chances. The Internship is all too eager to affirm the go-bro status quo and so as not to alienate any multiplexgoer the films brainy young interns are made out to be cuddly Big Bang Theory-ish cartoons--the tiger mamas boy the cosplay-curious virgin. Nothing surprises here save the ease with which Bridesmaids standout Rose Byrne is sidelined as an ornamental love interest and the unabashedness of the films teat-suck brand worship. Supersizing product placement to the level of full-on corporate sponsorship director Shawn Levy envisions the Internet giants Bay Area compound as an amusement park Shangri-la of gleaming surfaces and unlimited refills. Alas such kowtowing is indicative of a movie sorely bereft of ideas laughs and justification for the comic duos undifferentiating self-regard.

(Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 6 2013 608 p.m. ET You need only watch the trailer to know that ""The Internship"" is a promo for Google; think Google for Dummies as well as Summer Comedy for Dummies. Its as if the writers googled ""how to write a script"" and nothing came up so they wrote this anyway. The pretext--plot being too big a word--is a couple of 40-something losers trying to talk their way into internships on the Google campus in northern California then succeeding against all odds and despite every dictate of logic. Eight years ago the co-stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were wonderfully funny as fast-talking con men in ""Wedding Crashers."" This time theyre newly unemployed salesmen in a film that defangs their former raunchiness--the rating is PG-13--while forcing them to jabber as fast as demented chipmunks. ENLARGE Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn 20th Century Fox Every now and then the pace slows sufficiently for Billy and Nick--those are the names pasted on the cardboard characters--to have quasihuman interactions with fellow interns who are tech-savvy geniuses half their age or in the case of Nick to woo a beautiful Google executive played blandly by Rose Byrne. The overage heroes are clueless when it comes to technology and almost everything else--Billys main cultural referent is ""Flashdance""--but still able to give the kids what the film frames as life lessons i.e. cheerful banalities about teamwork true love belief in ones self and the courage to dream. The director Shawn Levy and the writers Mr. Vaughn and Jared Stern have dreamed up a feel-good comedy that plays like a demo reel of deja views. Its own referents include campus comedies of the 1940s Andy Hardy Harry Potter every film youve ever seen about fish out of water and by extension ""Death of a Salesman."" Most of the energy however bogus comes from a depiction of the Google campus as a rumpus room where Mensa misfits spout technobabble and solve abstruse problems when they arent sliding down supersize slides playing volleyball or ping-pong napping in nap pods or scarfing down free food. One extremely long scene is devoted to Billys discovery that food on the Google campus is indeed free. One interminable sequence set in a San Francisco strip joint is devoted to bulking up the running time which at 119 minutes contains at least 10 minutes of fresh material. The cast includes Will Ferrell in a small uncredited role as a mattress salesman who has the phrase ""make reasonable choices"" tattooed in Sanskrit on his neck. Make your own reasonable choice and find something else to see. Much Ado About Nothing Watch a clip from the film ""Much Ado About Nothing"" a modern retelling of Shakespeares classic comedy from Joss Whedon about two pairs of lovers with different takes on romance and a way with words. (Photo/Video Roadside Attractions) The poster for Joss Whedons ""Much Ado About Nothing"" shows a swimmer with a snorkel in his mouth diving glasses over his eyes and a cocktail glass containing amber liquid in his left hand. (Hes the actor Fran Kranz immersed in the role of Claudio.) Were Shakespeare able to glimpse this apparition across the swimming pools of time he might recognize the glass for the drinking device it is. But would he recognize Mr. Whedons version of his timeless comedy? Apart from the problem of accents sure why not? Most of the words are still in place and many of them are delivered wittily though some are tossed off awfully casually or downright clumsily. Even if snorkeling wasnt a major sport in 16th-century Sicily where the action was originally set the joyous spirit of the play has been preserved in this modest homegrown production. ENLARGE Fran Kranz Roadside Attractions Literally homegrown since the film was shot--by Jay Hunter in handsome black-and-white--over the course of 12 days in Mr. Whedons house in Santa Monica and performed mainly by actors he had worked with on his television shows as well as on last years megablockbuster ""The Avengers."" The trappings along with the costumes are entirely contemporary. The lovely music composed by the filmmaker includes a delicately jazzy setting of ""Sigh No More."" The least successful line readings are casually conversational and for the most part rushed; the brief shooting schedule must have taken its toll. The constable and his watchmen--who use computers flashlights and cameras on their watch--cant seem to find a comic tone. The best performances however are skillful charmingly physical and notwithstanding the movies relatively flat modern mode zestfully heightened. Mr. Kranz unsnorkeled portrays Claudio with affecting passion whether that oft-befuddled count is gazing into his beloved Heros eyes--shes played sweetly and simply by Jillian Morgese--or wrongly convinced that she has been unfaithful. Alexis Denisofs narcissistic Benedick does joggers stretches and runs up flights of stairs to impress Amy Ackers ardent brittle Beatrice; hes a perfect California popinjay. But Mr. Denisof is also smart and playful just as Ms. Acker is quick lithe and funny. The cast includes Clark Gregg as Leonato Reed Diamond as Don Pedro and Sean Maher as Don John. Paul Meston plays the minor role of Friar Francis with singular precision and startling eloquence. I should have guessed but didnt know until I looked him up that Mr. Meston is English. --J.M. Wish You Were Here Watch a clip from the film ""Wish You Were Here."" Four friends lose themselves in a carefree South-East Asian holiday. Only three come back and desperately search for answers to their friends mysterious disappearance. (Photo/Video eOne) I never would have guessed that ""Wish You Were Here"" was a feature debut for its Australian director Kieran Darcy-Smith. Elegantly crafted and filled with flawless performances this mysteriously charged drama comes alive in its very first frames--a man and woman soaking up the beauty of a beach in Cambodia--then holds you in the grip of its intricate structure. Joel Edgerton is Dave recently returned with his wife Alice (Felicity Price) to their family in Sydney after sharing a Southeast Asia vacation with Alices sister Steph ( Teresa Palmer) and Jeremy ( Antony Starr) an attractive Australian businessman they encountered during the trip. Steph soon returns too but Jeremy does not; hed gone missing and the mystery concerns his fate. ENLARGE In foreground Joel Edgerton Felicity Price Teresa Palmer and Antony Starr Entertainment One Films Mr. Edgerton who played the SEAL squadrons cocksure commander in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was last seen--and dismayingly wasted--as Tom Buchanan in Baz Luhrmanns ""The Great Gatsby."" This time hes got a role that does full justice to his extraordinary talents. Dave seems likable enough at the outset a caring husband and loving father but hes troubled and elusive in the tradition of flawed heroes. As he recounts the circumstances of Jeremys disappearance his wife like the investigating authorities at Australias foreign ministry comes to realize that his stories dont entirely make sense. Mr. Darcy-Smith an experienced actor who wrote the screenplay with Ms. Price--theyre husband and wife--dispenses clues information and delicately flavored red herrings through fast-paced flashbacks and crosscuts between Sydney and Cambodia. Some may find the fractured narrative difficult to decode. I experienced the difficulty but also enjoyed the challenge of the intimate and ultimately lucid technique. Mr. Darcy-Smith is a confident director and an unusually accomplished one whether hes punctuating an already tense scene with a childs insistent demand for ice cream or leading a drunken Dave into the ineffable menace of a Cambodian gambling house. Jules OLoughlin did the excellent cinematography and Jason Ballantine edited the film which is never less than engrossing. Even a drug-sniffing police dog gives a vivid performance. --J.M. ENLARGE DVD Focus Back to School (1986) There are campus comedies and then there are campus comedies. This one stars--to the exclusion of almost everyone and everything else--the goggle-eyed doughy-faced comic Rodney Dangerfield as a cheerful multimillionaire who upon discovering that his son is struggling in college enrolls as a freshman so he can give the kid some needed support. Mr. Dangerfields standard lament was ""I dont get no respect"" but he got a lot for his work in this film which is as funny as it is broad. Keith Gordon is the son and Robert Downey Jr. is the sons blue-haired punked-out roommate. ENLARGE Hamlet (2000) Michael Almereydas daring update of the Bard of Avon gives us the Danish prince played by Ethan Hawke as a film-school student who has not only lost all his mirth but his grip on reality. This perpetual postadolescent watches movies on a miniature VCR as he slouches around midtown Manhattan in a knitted hat and a purple funk. Sure the movies a stunt but one that succeeds more often than it stumbles. Julia Stiles plays Ophelia with mixed results though her mad scene staged on the helical ramp of the Guggenheim Museum is exquisite. ENLARGE Animal Kingdom (2010) Joel Edgerton is Barry a friend of the family in David Michods stunning drama about a brood of Australian criminals for whom family values are second only to self-interest. Jacki Weaver recently seen as Bradley Coopers mother in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is the sociopathic matriarch Janine ""Smurf"" Cody. Though James Frecheville is the ostensible star as Smurfs grandson Joshua--the youngest and most vulnerable of the Codys-- Ben Mendelsohn leaves the deepest impression as the most sadistic yet needy of Joshuas uncles.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 There are two ways of looking at The Internship. More about The Internship >> One is just to happily accept that the Wedding Crashers dudes are back invading a Silicon Valley campus where a legion of pampered twentysomethings oversees a vast Internet empire. Or second that Google - the search-engine behemoth that granted Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson access to its sun-splashed landscaped free-food and free-bikes Mountain View Calif. complex - is an evil empire bent on insinuating itself into every aspect of our lives even our knuckleheaded Hollywood comedies. Talk about product placement From the moment the lightbulb clicks on over the head of Vaughns character Billy - a watch salesman who with his buddy Nick (Wilson) has just been fired - the Google logo is everywhere. To be sure its there on Billys computer screen as he searches for employment opportunities (typing ""jobs for people with few skills"") and then hits on the idea of applying for the intern program at Google. But once Nick and Billy arrive at the Googleplex in Mountain View its like the companys brand is being burned into our skulls. And who wouldnt want to work here with its nap pods playrooms cafes its teeming throng of smartphone-thumbing millennials who act as if they just got out of homeroom - in junior high? ""When did 20 begin to look like 12?"" Nick wonders to Billy as they make their way through Googles swarm of worker bees. Directed by Shawn Levy of the Night at the Museum franchise The Internship finds Vaughn and Wilsons hopelessly old-school fortysomething doofuses thrown together with a team of misfit geek kids in a Hunger Games-like competition where many will be eliminated and few will survive. (Speaking of franchises theres even a Quidditch match a comically earthbound version of the Hogwarts sport.) The seemingly clueless Nick and Billy become improbable mentors citing Flashdance and other 80s cultural benchmarks and taking their troupe - a sexually curious nerd girl (Tiya Sircar) a guy who never looks up from his cellphone (Dylan OBrien) a high-IQ Asian with low social skills (Tobit Raphael) and their jive Google team leader (Josh Brener) - for a night on the town culminating with tequila shots at a strip club. What better way to bond? Vaughn and Wilson do the inseparable-comedy-duo thing that Hope and Crosby once perpetrated so successfully. Here their shtick includes sharing the same bed but not in a gay way (at least not overtly). And anyway The Internship boasts a romance between Wilson and Rose Byrne playing an all-work-and-no-play Google exec who eventually succumbs to Nicks stalker-like courtship. Byrne Australian and bespectacled is charming. And The Internship itself would be kind of charming too if this Google-recruitment film this 119-minute commercial for Googliness werent so downright creepy.

The fact that the two main characters are salesmen is almost redundant.Theyre played by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn and if their shtick tastes reheated then welcome back to 2005 and Wedding Crashers. Wilson is the laid-back soulful underachiever pining for a gal (Rachel McAdams back then Rose Byrne now) and navigating life with aw-shucks enthusiasm. Vaughn is the fast-talking overconfident best buddy who can bob and weave through this kind of fare on pure charm. Come to think of it he really could be a salesman.Wilsons Nick and Vaughns Billy lose their sales gigs for a watch wholesaler in the movies early funniest moments which play a little like National Lampoons Death of a Salesman. Then one night Billy Googles Google and instead of the universe exploding he finds out about the wonderful world of Google internships -- the ideal fish-out-of-water setup for a couple of analog lug heads in our increasingly digital world.Once they arrive on campus The Internship becomes a salad made from low-hanging fruit stocked with characters that come off more as collections of tics and traits than anything resembling people. Home-schooled sheltered Asian kid (Tobit Raphael)? Check. Hyper-ambitious jerk (Max Minghella riffing off the techie entitlement of his Social Network role)? Present. Unattainable ice queen who just needs the right guy to make her relax (Byrne)? Yo right here. And of course theres Google itself the multicolored corporate behemoth with a quirky spirit beneath its omnipotent swagger.The Internship isnt particularly offensive but it grows blandly formulaic with the precision of a perfectly optimized search engine. The wacky oldsters are out of their league and properly ridiculed. But they have life experience darn it and theyre ready to teach their intern teammates a thing or two about trust and self-confidence. Might they overcome hardship through hard work and end up succeeding?Sure many a comedy can be boiled down to such essentials. Its just that this one doesnt have anything else to hang its hat on outside the yin-and-yang chemistry of its stars. Original comedies let you forget that everything is preordained that all dilemmas will be solved in the end. Tired comedies like this one allow the predictability to fester like a sore. They dont just follow the road map; they unfold the thing across the screen.Sadly this is now standard operating procedure in the risk-averse climate of summer movies. The Internships idea of painting outside the lines is taking its outcast young heroes to a San Francisco strip club and getting the geeky kid drunk for the first time. Then when its time for the pat ending the moviecan at least say it got a little racy before pouring the syrup on. Its all so predictable it could have been generated by an app.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.THE INTERNSHIP(C) Directed by Shawn Levy.

Theres nothing funny about that which is exactly why someone ought to be making comedies about it. The Internship in which downtrodden old-school salespeople Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson enter the 21st century and land internships at Google might have been just the palliative for this sad state of affairs. But when you need cheering up about your inability to pay the rent or your lack of health insurance do you really want to drop 10 precious shekels (or more) on a movie so desperately unfunny it makes you want to slit your wrists? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - I laughed exactly once during The Internship at a moment when Vaughns character performs a Google search using the words ""jobs for people with few skills."" If youve been there yourself youll probably find this funny too. But mostly its depressing to watch two reasonably gifted comic actors play clueless oldies who just cant get the hang of this brand-new Internet thing. As the movie opens longtime pals and business partners Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) meet with a loyal customer at a tony restaurant. Their job? Selling wristwatches the old-fashioned way out of a case with a handle on top. The customer has to break the news to them that the company employing them has gone out of business; they confront their boss who confirms their worst fears. (Hes played by John Goodman phoning in his patented Foghorn Leghorn imitation.)Film Details The Internship RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time119 More Info Trailer Billy the more enterprising of these two Luddite numbnuts decides the path to riches lies in the World Wide Web and he somehow lands an online interview with the Google people. The internship committee takes pity and before long Billy and Nick land at the companys ultra-slick aggressively fun San Francisco headquarters where theyre forced to attend corporate brainwashing sessions while wearing stupid propeller beanies all in the hopes of landing a job.Theyre also of course lumped in with a bunch of kids some 20 years their junior. A haughty tech snob (Max Minghella) taunts them cruelly. They fall in with a crew of bright social misfits (played by Dylan OBrien Tiya Sinclair Tobit Raphael and Josh Brener) and teach them life lessons by first taking them out for Chinese food and then to a strip club. In between Billy and Nick advertise their broad and deep lack of knowledge of HTML and app development -- its hilarious how much they dont know To further kick up the laugh meter Billy stocks up on more than he can actually eat let alone carry at the search behemoths famous free cafeteria.Rose Byrne swans through the movie as Nicks uptight love interest; Aasif Mandvi plays the ball-breaking intern coordinator. Vaughn and Wilson look out of place and uncomfortable -- theyre not just playing two getting-older guys who need to jump-start their careers theyre acting out a personal pantomime of middle-age discomfort thats unpleasant to watch. (Vaughn is partially responsible for this monstrosity of a script co-written with Jared Stern.) Director Shawn Levy -- the guy behind the Night at the Museum franchise -- doesnt help matters by repeatedly training the camera on the stars faces to capture them laughing wincing looking at first downtrodden and then triumphant. He doesnt seem to trust us to get any of the jokes or any of the rampant insecurity these characters might be feeling.And really -- how stupid would we have to be to not get whats going on in The Internship? Worse yet the damn thing is nearly two hours long. Which means for those of you on a really tight entertainment budget youll be paying at least 8 cents per minute not to laugh. Your money is better spent on beans and rice.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are back where they dont belong. When last we saw them together in 2005s ""Wedding Crashers"" they infiltrated and upended a cherished institution. In ""The Internship"" their misguided bravura insinuates them into another kind of institution -- the corporate world of Google. Only the setting has changed; Vaughn retains his glib-yet-desperate patter and Wilson his earnest sweetness. Its their shtick and theyre sticking to it. After their jobs selling watches in an increasingly watchless society dry up Billy (Vaughn) Googles ""jobs for people with no skills"" and lands himself and Nick (Wilson) an interview for a summer internship at the technology behemoth. In a nod to diversity if not believability they make the cut. Upon arriving at the candy-colored Disneyland of the (real-life) Google campus of course its obvious that life experience or no their University of Phoenix resumes are no match for the Stanford pedigrees of the other hundred or so fresh-faced whippersnappers. Billy and Nicks blustery optimism hits the shoals early when theyre dispatched to a team with four other misfits who nevertheless roll their eyes at the decrepit specimens theyre saddled with. Inevitably the oldsters dispatch some sage advice -- albeit embedded in moldy ""Flashdance"" references -- that is actually helpful and the six teammates bond into the ""Bad News Bears"" in beanies. Aptly because ""The Internship"" is really just a sappy sports story; the ""Survivor""-meets-Mensa challenges establish our heroes as underdogs providing for slow-mo montages and a do-or-die moment that sets up the ""big game"" finale. 20th Century Fox Vince Vaughn left and Owen Wilson on the Google campus in ""The Internship."" This is a movie that skates by on the sheer likability of its stars; there are genuine laughs in the script co-written by Vaughn. The age-versus-youth theme however is as subtle as a meat cleaver Are we supposed to buy that Billy and Nick are unfamiliar with ""X-Men"" and ""Harry Potter"" or that Billy cant remember that the term is ""online"" not ""on the line""?

Apparently you get ""The Internship"" a two-hour infomercial for one of the worlds biggest technology companies that fronts as a laddish Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson farce. Unless it should be phrased the other way around and ""The Internship"" is better understood as a machine-made conventional comedy that breaches new frontiers in product placement - by branding the entire film with a corporate logo so familiar that youve probably seen within the last five minutes.Either way this movie is stuffed to the brim with ""Googliness"" a word that is used several times in a pseudo-whimsical fashion thats supposed to make you think its not corporate drone-speak. It means something like Innovative Or Nerdy while also fun and team-spirited Or Totally workaholic and subservient and acclimated to a ruthless Darwinian economy where talented young people are pitted against each other Hufflepuff vs. Gryffindor style in a geek-Olympics where they work really hard all summer for no money in the hope of someday somehow getting an actual job So so much Googliness. What this movie and all its Googliness produces in me is ""oogliness"" that feeling well known to tech-company interns on Friday nights where you have to leave one foot on the floor and place a bucket by your head when you go to sleep.Not only does ""The Internship"" set a breathtaking new standard in inter-corporate fellatio it also accomplishes something genuinely unusual by insulting two different target demographics at once. Veteran Hollywood comedy hack Shawn Levy (of the ""Night in the Museum"" movies and ""Date Night"" which by his standards was a masterpiece) working with a screenplay by Vaughn and Jared Stern portrays the films Googly younger generation as a pack of cynical and damaged little pricks while depicting the 40ish Vaughn and Wilson characters as buffoonish losers unfamiliar with such radical new terminology as ""app"" or ""online"" or ""coding."" Theres an entire gag about the fact that Google interviewers believe that Billy Vaughns character has represented himself as knowing the programming language C++ when what he really meant is that in school he got a C-plus in typing class. Comedy gold. And then theres the extended scene when Billy learns with ever-increasing Googly-eyed wonder that the coffee and bagels and pizza and pudding and so on at You Know Where are all free. ""Free? Free as in free?"" You know it dude - free as in just like all that labor youre performing for the company (oh snap).What makes ""The Internship"" especially unfortunate is that there are pieces of a better funnier movie lying around here pretty much unnoticed. As always Owen Wilson is a delightful screen presence even though his character Nick remains almost completely devoid of distinguishing characteristics and his budding romance with Dana (Rose Byrne) an Aussie overworked career-woman type never amounts to anything more than a nice idea. Perhaps because he helped write and produce the film Vaughn delivers one of his leanest and most focused performances in recent years largely free of the paunchy hollow-eyed belligerence hes exhibited way too often. Billy is a sweet but lost alpha-male from a bygone era a glad-handing boozy salesman whose refusal to dislike anyone is both his strength and his downfall. You Might Also Like Its just that almost everything that happens to Nick and Billy - who are mistaken for a same-sex couple when they first get to Google; that movie would definitely have been better than this one - is a hackneyed and/or stupid fragment of some marginally superior comedy. They lose their jobs selling watches for John Goodman (in a throwaway role) and Nick signs on to sell mattresses for his sisters repulsive brother-in-law played by Will Ferrell with a goatee a weird Sanskrit tattoo and an unnecessarily public appetite for anal sex. Ferrells character is unsettling but at least suggests some unexpected dark places this movie might go. Instead once Billy gets the brilliant idea of being the oldest Google internship applicants in history we go straight into episodic and utterly predictable group-of-misfits comedy.I know this counts as an outrageous spoiler but once relocated to the candy-colored and sun-splashed Google campus Nick and Billy become the linchpins of a deeply uncool team of young interns who discover their total awesomeness. Theres the overly detached hipster with rectangular glasses the white kid who talks black the home-schooled Asian genius who needs to break loose and the geek-fetish girl who turns out to be a virgin. And while its true that Nick and Billy bring absolutely nothing to the table information-technology wise they do possess important life skills when it comes to hitting on strippers and ordering rounds of Jagermeister. There are a few oddly endearing moments from Vaughn and Wilson along the way to go with an OK performance from Max Minghella as the Draco Malfoy of Google interns and an awkward one from the generally reliable Aasif Mandvi. But nothing about Google or its campus or its vaunted corporate culture is ever presented with anything that even touches irony or sarcasm or humor unless you count the suggestion that by golly its senior employees sure do work hard. Mercifully this movie is so dreadful that it probably wont pave the way for a zany comedy about BPs corporate response to the Deepwater Horizon disaster or Judd Apatows goofball farce about the crazy friendship between Jamie Dimon and Vikram Pandit. Anyway those movies just wouldnt have the same sloshing gooey kind of Googliness. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Photo Credit 20th Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two unemployed middle-age men finagle an internship at youth-centric Google. BOTTOM LINE Feels like a rush job with the Vaughn-Wilson team texting it in but its hard to gripe too much about this good-natured and mostly raunch-free comedy. CAST Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Rose Byrne LENGTH 200 Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell out-of-work salesmen angling for a job at the youth-centric Internet giant Google in ""The Internship."" Its a well-timed comedy about unemployment technology and the generation gap and its comforting main message is that the world will always need the kind of guy known as a people person. Its Billy who gets the idea to apply to Google after the watch company he works for unexpectedly folds. ""Watches are obsolete"" says his boss (John Goodman) holding up a time-telling smartphone as proof ""and so are you."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? After a fruitless online search for ""jobs for people with few skills"" Billy begins Googling Google itself. After some fast talking he and Nick travel to the companys headquarters (presumably in Mountain View Calif.) where they must compete against scores of younger smarter hipper interns. Directed by Shawn Levy (""The Watch"") and co-written by Vaughn and Jared Stern ""The Internship"" sometimes feels like a compendium of search results for ""comedies about misfits."" The setup is a series of competitions for the prize of an actual job. Billy and Nick team up with snotty Stuart (Dylan OBrien) nerdy Lyle (Josh Brener) pretty Neha (Tiya Sircar) and the token uptight Asian (Tobit Raphael). The bad guys are led by Graham (Max Minghella) naturally a Brit. Along the way the oldsters teach the youngsters how to look up from their keyboards and enjoy the world which includes strip-clubs. Nick finds a love-interest in workaholic Dana (Rose Byrne). Though the interns are driven by an unforgiving boss (Aasif Mandvi) ""The Internship"" does depict Google as ""the best place to work in America"" as Billy describes it. The movie also indulges in outright fantasy when it shows the interns manning Googles live help line. (As if) Still the company makes sense for this comedy. Imagine how the movies tone -- even its entire genre -- would change if our heroes landed at say Goldman Sachs (thriller) or McDonalds (tragedy). 228 MoviesThe Internship trailer The Vaughn-Wilson routines feel slightly lazy and the whole affair feels like a rush-job.

(Phil Bray) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 6 2013 400 PM Title The Internship Film Info PG-13 Sexuality language. Area theaters. Who let an unfunny irritatingly acted two-hour commercial for Google onto multiplex screens? Thats the best way to describe ""The Internship"" if one cannot make a raspberry sound. Only Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilsons genial camaraderie momentarily buoys the movie from unwatchable to merely awful. The pair who co-starred in 2005s ""Wedding Crashers"" play small-time watch salesmen whose company shuts down because ""no one wears watches they just look at their phones."" So Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn who co-wrote the script) are established as fortyish dinosaurs. What wackier place to plunk them down than in the headquarters of Google? Oh sorry -- thats ""what totally cool place"" since Googles massive playground-like San Francisco campus is described no kidding as a ""Garden of Eden"" that ""connects people to information"" a primary-colored nirvana filled with company bikes ""rest pods"" for employees free coffee and Quidditch-game reenactments that attracts ""over a million advertisers."" And did you notice the dry-cleaning service? Director Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"" ""Date Night"") makes sure we do as Billy and Nick navigate techie-land after being chosen to compete for a summer internship. Branded as out-of-touch losers by a twerpy villain (Max Minghella) and not helped by an officious supervisor (Aasif Mandvi who seems to be in on the corporate joke) Billy and Nick assemble a team of outsiders to win this ""mental Hunger Games. "" The participants include a ""Star Wars""-loving geek girl a mumbling home-schooled savant a brooding hipster and the gangs nerdy manager Lile (Josh Brener) the films most annoying character by far. ""Well workshop that its in beta"" Lile says in one of 900K stupid lines. Do they win the competition which includes a test to see how great they are as help-line operators? This recruitment movie never Googled a concept it didnt copy so go ahead and guess. But audiences should shut down since even the title is done in Googles familiar home-page font. (There are also repeated shout-outs to the ""X-Men"" movies since the studio behind those films and this one Twentieth Century Fox apparently wanted in on the self-referencing action). Yet no one apparently had an issue with the band of outsiders bonding at a strip club as Nick (who calls his pal Billy ""El Nino"" ""Big B"" and oddly ""Bojangles"") romances a higher-up (Rose Byrne) by being a jerk. Theres also a requisite cameo from Will Ferrell trying to be weird as a ""back-door""-loving mattress salesman who is dating Nicks sister. ""I believe what we do makes peoples lives better"" chirps a Google employee at the rah-rah ending. Maybe so but two hours spent watching ""The Internship"" will make your life worse.

When Vince Vaughn does it in ""The Internship"" all that happens is that the movie blows up. Vaughn and Owen Wilson play unemployed idiots (their last jobs had them selling watches for a company that they didnt realize had gone out of business) who apply for internships meant for college students at Google. Though they clearly lied on their resumes know nothing about tech and are old enough to remember when AOL was a hot stock the company hires them alongside the 21-year-olds anyway. Because a low-level employee says the company needs ""diversity."" And brainless white guys are definitely an underserved minority. ""The Internship"" is essentially a rehash of ""Old School"" only with a tech campus instead of a college one but problem Coding is unlike dumb fraternity stunts -- it is neither cinematic nor fakeable. The movie deals with this inherent lack of visual interest by pretending that winning a quidditch match against fellow interns might help you get hired but put me down as doubting Google got where it is by hiring based on ability to play fictitious sports. Also theres a lengthy detour for a party scene that has nothing to do with the main action which is the boys quest to win a series of challenges on a team with three fellow interns. Along the way there are maybe 30 references to ""Flashdance"" that underline how clunky and dated the humor is; most of the characters on hand werent even born when that one came out. Director Shawn Levys work has as always all the edge of a tub of margarine -- hes the guy who did ""Night at the Museum."" And ""The Internship"" has the air of a promotional video for Google. But the main problem is that there are no funny ideas in the script which wouldnt have made it past Vince Vaughns agents assistants college roommates dentist if it were written by anyone but Vince Vaughn (together with Jared Stern -- as if their last film ""The Watch"" was such a success). Vaughn can make funny dialogue funnier with his twitchy doubletalk but here the faster he runs his mouth the more desperately awful the movie becomes. In a scene where he thinks saying ""on the line"" instead of ""online"" is so funny that he repeats it a dozen times you want to put your arm around his shoulder and say ""Its OK Vince. The joke died. You can let go and move on with your life."" This movie was flawed from the start as misshapen as Wilsons woebegone nose. In ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" and ""The Secret of My Success"" a sly schemer could find a way to the top but programmers cant get by on sweet talk. True the boys do have a skill -- salesmanship -- and Google needs ad salesmen but the movies reliance on a standard silly-contest plot makes it look like theyd need a wide variety of abilities to get hired. So it pretends that Wilsons character after one programming class could somehow catch up to Stanfords finest prodigies students who have been coding since kindergarten. Does the movie need a love interest? Sure so it throws in a cute girl (Rose Byrne as a brilliant midlevel employee) who simply switches from resisting the Wilson character to liking him. Of course the best Byrne can do at an overwhelmingly male company is a 40-year-old with no income. Google which in keeping with the pro-censorship stance it espouses in China continued the tradition by ordering the deletion of a scene that showed one of its driverless cars crashing reportedly thinks ""The Internship"" will boost its recruiting. Can there be any person smart enough to work at Google though who hasnt already heard of it? It seems more likely that a dumb movie will lead only to a time-wasting surge in applications from dummies. Maybe ""The Internship"" was secretly funded by Bing. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next WATCH Fallon sings barbershop version of Color Me Badd Read Next WATCH Fallon sings barbershop version of Color Me Badd Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 37904 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19630 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16219 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Product placement is one thing; building a whole movie around the glorification of a multinational corporation is something else entirely. Essentially a feature-length sponsored post The Internship casts Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as middle-aged salesmen who find themselves competing against braniac college kids for a job at Google. As the film incessantly reminds viewers the company--envisioned here as a professional paradise where the food is free diversity is key and cars drive themselves--is regularly voted the greatest place to work in America. Characters go further describing it as an ""engine for change"" the ""Garden of Eden"" and ""the best amusement park youve ever been to times a million."" If this excessively flattering farce is to be believed Googliness is next to godliness. Occasionally the relentless PR campaign pauses long enough for someone to make a joke or two. Look past all the Google-gushing and The Internship operates like a run-of-the-mill campus comedy populated almost exclusively with archetypes the disapproving authority figure (Aasif Mandvi quite funny in his handful of scenes) the snooty rich-kid villain (Max Minghella still playing students seven years after Art School Confidential) and a smoking-hot professor type (Rose Byrne) who slowly succumbs to Wilsons aww-shucks charisma. Theres also a lovable group of underdogs--the movies version of a misfit fraternity--who learns to cut loose work together and love their older out-of-touch teammates. Much of the supposed humor derives from the cluelessness of Vaughn and Wilson who reference ""obscure"" 80s films like Flashdance somehow know about The Hunger Games but not Harry Potter and say ""on-the-line"" instead of ""online."" How do two grown men without even a passing understanding of the Internet score internships at the worlds leading web company? Basically by telling a sob story during their interview and positioning themselves as victims of the financial collapse. After all Google isnt made of stone If corporations really were people it would be the benevolent billionaire who buys the orphanage. Or Tony Stark glowing with gadgets but out to save the world. As a de facto Wedding Crashers sequel The Internship is exceptionally mild; even an impromptu strip-club visit feels SFW. Can the tameness be attributed to director Shawn Levy tireless purveyor of bland PG-13 romps? Or did the producers not want to risk alienating the image-conscious corporation they shamelessly lionize? Either way theres something modestly charming about the kindler gentler shtick the Crashers develop here. Vaughn whos been on ""asshole autopilot"" for about a decade seems especially liberated by the chance to play a character so irrepressibly optimistic. (His relentless attempts to befriend Mandvi provide a few honest chuckles.) But then the real star of The Internship is Google itself and what a self-aggrandizing diva she is. In one final insult the movie presents the company as a noble savior of small-businesses beating back an economic depression one sponsorship sale at a time. Its enough to make a lifelong Googler want to switch to Bing.

"The Internship movie review by Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Search for laughs falls short in The Internship  Video The Internship review Egregious product placement? Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and RedEye movie critic Matt Pais review ""The Internship"" the latest film with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (Posted on June 6 2013.) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and RedEye movie critic Matt Pais review ""The Internship"" the latest film with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (Posted on June 6 2013.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune You might say ""The Internship"" is in the bag for Google the fearsomely powerful search engine and commerce behemoth. But that doesnt quite convey the extent of the coziness. This film carries Googles water. It is in fact Googles little minion movie.By the end of this occasionally funny (two scenes in particular; more later on those) re-teaming of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson eight years after ""Wedding Crashers"" the familiar friendly Google logo -- Im no stranger to it; I just looked up the spelling of ""behemoth"" by Googling it -- has been burned into your psyche forever. This isnt product placement; its product brain imprint. Times have changed since Vaughn and Wilson bedded all those women while getting in touch with their sensitive sides in ""Wedding Crashers"" a film belonging to a different economic period in our history. Today these guys are lucky to find a job any job let alone a bed let alone someone to share it.Early in ""The Internship"" high-end LA wristwatch salesmen Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) find themselves out of work learning of their companys demise from a longtime customer in the middle of a dinner meeting. The writing and staging in the scene in question is strangely awkward enough to make you think Whatever happened to the art of the expositional setup? Nick is thrown a bone by his sleazy brother-in-law (an uncredited Will Ferrell as a mattress salesman) but clearly is meant for better things. Once Billy gets bounced from his longtime relationship he gets busy finding the middle-aged formerly dynamic duos true calling. And then Nick and Billy video-conference their way into a summer internship at the worlds greatest company.Leaving LA for Silicon Valley and Google its a rough go at first. Our mid-40-somethings are treated as freaks and dinosaurs and lumbering wastes of time especially by the storys evil adversary Graham (Max Minghella) the Blue Meanie of weaselly interns. As Billy and Nick team up with a few fellow outcast interns in a (fictional) competition to see which team wins the coveted full-time jobs at summers end they must prove their worth their adaptability their street smarts and their party-hearty skills. The latters affirmed by a scene in which the boy-men chaperon their 20ish comrades on a lap-dance/strip-club excursion leading to unmentionable sight gags and a general sense that the scene does not belong with anything else in ""The Internship.""""This place is incredible"" Vaughns character says ogling the Google campus for the first time. Theres a lot of that in ""The Internship"" as scripted by Vaughn and Jared Stern (of the infamously unfunny ""The Watch""). Director Shawn Levy surely knew that the script at hand didnt warrant a full two-hour running time; even if you enjoy ""The Internship"" as my son did it feels 20 minutes over-full at least. Cut out half of the ""Flashdance"" and ""X-Men"" references and youre halfway there.The casting helps. Aasif Mandvi does the trick as the intimidating internship program leader; Rose Byrne given precious little to do lightens the load as the Google staffer to whom Wilsons character takes a shine. Two scenes work well in ""The Internship."" In a first-date dinner sequence Wilson and Byrne are allowed to loosen up enjoy each others screen company and give the audience a break from the main plotlines familiar machinations. This is followed by a nicely played encounter between Vaughn and Josh Gad (who starred on Broadway in ""The Book of Mormon"") who plays a fellow intern. Here too the interplay relaxes allowing us to get to know the folks for whom were supposed to be rooting. And then before long were back to the films primary objective to treat the company at the storys center to another metaphoric lap dance.mjphillipstribune.comThe Internship -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexuality some crude humor partying and language)Running time 159Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Google Inc.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 935 a.m. EDT June 6 2013To say these salesmen are hardly tech-savvy is an understatement. But theyre not funny.Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn star in the bland and not particularly funny The Internship.(Photo Phil Bray 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Owen Wilson Vince Vaughn Rose Byrne John Goodman Josh Gad B.J. Novak Aasif MandviRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 59 minutes; Opens Thursday night in select cities and Friday nationwideVince Vaughn and Owen Wilson may be the worst interns since Monica Lewinsky.These middle-aged guys dont just lack tech savvy theyre pretty much impervious to the digital age. They cant figure out how webcams work and describe surfing the Web as being ""on the line."" Its hard to imagine how they found their way to Google headquarters for their internships -- certainly not with a GPS.Theyre clueless and not particularly funny in the Shawn Levy-directed comedy The Internship ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide) a tale about a pair of fortysomething guys who lose their jobs and take unpaid internships at the Silicon Valley search engine conglomerate.While Vaughn and Wilson were hilarious in 2005s Wedding Crashers those expecting this to be Google Crashers are in for a rude awakening. The Internship is closer to Dude Wheres My Job?VIDEO Wilson and Vaughns parenting styles clashMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarBilly (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) sell pricey wristwatches. They learn that the company they work for has gone out of business from a client theyre wining and dining. Their boss (John Goodman) runs a rinky-dink operation and they appear to be the only salesmen. So how is it that a random customer knows the company has gone bust but its two main employees are gob-smacked?Rather than looking for new sales jobs Billy decides they should take unpaid internships in a field they know nothing about.Of course theyre the ages of most of the other interns parents a fact that is pointed out to them incessantly. ""In a world of excellence old and unexceptional qualifies as diversity"" theyre told by a snooty young intern.Vaughns charm serves him sporadically (he also co-wrote the script) and Wilson is blandly affable. But sometimes their garrulous riffing is just plain annoying.amp;lt;--iframe--amp;gt;""Youre saying a lot of words really fast that dont mean anything"" one of their fellow interns accurately snarls.Where the movie trips up most is in its dogged desire to impart life lessons. Wisdom intoned by a pair of directionless neer-do-wells to brilliant tech savants hardly seems useful. When those motivational moments are intended as jokes -- as in Billys impassioned reference to Flashdance -- the device can be funny. But when the guys try to earnestly convey instruction from the school of hard knocks its as corny as that sounds.Stereotypes abound including the requisite nerdy Asian boy bossed around by his tiger mother. When Billy dabbles in selling motorized scooters at a retirement home a sequence involving a pair of randy old ladies is far more cringe-inducing than humorous.The term Google is manipulated for laughs -- employees are judged for their degree of ""Googliness"" and those whove recently joined the company are ""Nooglers."" Its so cloying it could be used in an ad for Bing.Stay home and Google ""good movies"" rather than waste time on this going-nowhere Internship. 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/ZNzcpJSummer Movies Calendar JulyTake a look at the films heading to the box office this July complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

RELATED NEWS Hotlist 10 best workplace movies Vaughn and Wilson bond with kids on Internship set By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jun 5 2013 359 PM In ""The Internship"" Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play two aging guys who have lost their old-school sales jobs but manage to finagle a coveted internship at Google. If you think that sounds like the set-up for a two-hour testimonial to the virtues of the search-engine and technology giant well at one point Wilsons character actually refers to the campus as the Garden of Eden which gives you a pretty good idea of the films point of view. Ah but the movie is not just product placement in search of a plot. Its so much less than that. Its also a too-long one-note affair predictably following the patterns of any fish-out-of-water comedy you can think of. Why if you think two old codgers might be able to teach these young whippersnappers a thing or two about life beyond the grid then youve probably seen the same movies Vaughn who came up with the story and co-wrote the script has. Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) sell watches until the day they are told by a client that their company no longer exists. Their boss (John Goodman) gives them a couple of complimentary watches and kicks them to the curb with the warning that its tough out there especially for a pair of dinosaurs. Billys girlfriend leaves him and Nick ekes out a living selling mattresses. But Billy somehow gets them an interview for Google internships and as another character puts it in this environment old people with no skills count as a form of diversity. Theyre in. Once there Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) the director of the internship program informs the assembled group that they will be breaking into teams for a summerlong series of competitions. The members of the winning team get a full-time job offer. Billy and Nick with no technical knowhow arent exactly the pick of the litter when it comes to choosing teams. They are thrown together with brilliant but socially challenged kids (Dylan OBrien Josh Brener Tobit Raphael and Tiya Sircar) who manage to check off each box on the stereotypical nerd list. Their little band of misfit toys pales in comparison to the team led by a genius jackass played by Max Minghella. And there you have it. The odds are stacked mightily against Billy and Nick and their group but really is there anything that cant be overcome by getting knuckle-dragging drunk and visiting a strip club? Now thats old-school bonding. Like 1950. A little romance between Nick and a driven Google lifer (Rose Byrne) is thrown in at no extra charge and without much emotional payoff. Vaughn and Wilson so funny in ""Wedding Crashers"" have much less to work with here. From the jokes youd think they were 90. (Though in fairness to the tech-savvy people theyre competing with at Google they might as well be.) Director Shawn Levy could have made a darkly funny film that examines the challenges of an entire generation whose traditional skills have become outmoded whose members must evolve or see their prospects die on the vine. Instead hes made something much less challenging a by-the-numbers comedy that aims too low. ""The Internship"" has some funny moments. The cast is too talented for it to come up completely dry. But for a movie about a place so filled with ambitious climbers it is far too lazy. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Movie review Google crashers join Internet age in The Internship - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Google crashers join Internet age in The Internship The Internship Phil Bray / 20th Century Fox Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn star in ""The Internship."" Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn star in ""The Internship."" (Phil Bray / 20th Century Fox) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic When Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson crashed weddings with such crazy success in 2005 they wanted to get laid. Older and not particularly wiser in ""The Internship"" the guys now want to get jobs.Thats funny. Unfortunately the comedy is linked to some new-age nonsense about old-school guys finally catching up with the Internet age. Its a one-liner forged into a two-hour joke. At stake is a much-coveted summer internship at Google that could lead to a full-time gig. This sets up a fish-out-water tale with the 40-something goofballs essentially thrown into a school ruled by young nerd geniuses.VIDEO Upcoming summer films Like high school there are cliques. But at Google IQ is the cool factor and the team sports usually involve math.The plot follows a familiar path -- old ways collide with the new world battle lines are drawn and lessons learned by all.Case in point Nick and Billy Wilson and Vaughn respectively discover that the expression is ""online"" not ""on the line."" A joke that will make anyone under 100 groan.On the other side of the cultural exchange the brainiacs learn how to do shots approach girls and appreciate the Golden Gate Bridge. As all that suggests the movie is not exactly a laugh riot. But its comedy is amiable enough -- and surprisingly clean.Vaughn and Jared Stern who wrote ""The Watch"" with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have turned in a screenplay light on salty language. Shawn Levy the man behind the family-friendly antics of the various ""Night at the Museums"" directs. And with the exception of a trip to a local strip club one kids first lap dance and a Will Ferrell cameo theres not much in the way of sexual references either. There are however many heart-to-hearts with Nick and Billy in the role of stand-up guys almost dad-like in the way they treat the kids.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesRaunchy or not naughty or nice with Vaughn and Wilson its never so much what is said but how they say it. If you liked the relationship and the repartee they had going in ""Wedding Crashers"" that chemistry is very much there defining and driving ""The Internship"" just dialed down a few notches.It is apropos that the film opens with a sales pitch since ""The Internship"" can seem like a Hollywood-sign-sized ad for the supremacy and humanity of Google. But were not on the candy-colored Google campus just yet.First Nick and Billy psych themselves up to make a big sale. That involves singing along to a mix tape that features Alanis Morissettes ""Ironic"" -- you know ""An old man turned 98 he won the lottery and died the next day.""These guys do sales the old-fashioned way making their pitch face to face over dinner. John Goodman is their not-so-horrible boss but its the client who tells them their company has folded.Billy and Nick are not merely out of a sale they are out of a job -- and worse in their mid-40s out of luck in the modern marketplace.Nick quickly gets pressed into working for his sisters boyfriend an uncredited Ferrell portraying a mattress salesman. A slight variation of the actors scuzzy Chazz in ""Wedding Crashers"" he takes care of the movies innuendoes.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsInspiration for a better brighter future comes from Billy. After all of his Google searches lead him to dead-end jobs he -- imagine a light bulb here -- Googles Google. The Google landing page with its very familiar logo gets virtually all of the movies beauty shots.A brief Skype interview between the guys and Google recruiters sets the very low bar for how dated the jokes will be about Billys lack of social-networking savvy. But their age will help the high-tech giants diversity mix so Nick and Billy are soon on their way to San Francisco and the companys incredible main campus.Between the free coffee fruit and bagels the campus bikes and the nap-pods I wanted to fill out an application.Vaughns Billy is once again able to fast talk his way into and out of more jams than most people have in a lifetime -- his stint on the Google help line is one of the films finer moments.Wilson lays on his aw-shucks boyish charm and once again is in line to get the good girl. Shes an A-type Google exec played by Rose Byrne who actually uses her Aussie accent for a change although the part is one-dimensional requiring her to be paperdoll-pretty -- no real acting required.Now to those lessons learned. If ""The Internship"" taught me anything it is not about aging in the new age but that Google not Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth. For Vaughn and Wilson it should be about coming up with new really new material before they take their show on the road again.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com---------------------------------The InternshipMPAA rating PG-13 for sexuality some crude humor partying and languageRunning time 2 hoursPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Google Inc.

"Review The Internship an affable romp - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Internship an affable rompBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 06/05/2013 120000 PM PDTUpdated 06/07/2013 024515 PM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Opening Friday The East The Internship The Kings of Summer Much Ado About Nothing The Purge Shadow Dancer Tiger Eyes We Steal Secrets Wish You Were Here Related StoriesMay 31Googles interns get a sneak preview of The InternshipMay 28Google receives its Hollywood close-up with The Internship""The Internship"" is a big puppy dog of a film -- one that in its way is just so lovable good-natured and cuddly that you can almost forgive the bad things it does.The comedy which reunites Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson who first buddied up in the 2005 hit ""The Wedding Crashers"" has generated an inordinate amount of advance publicity because of its setting in the world of Google. The Internet giant not only allowed some of the filming to be done on its Mountain View campus but it also provided technical assistance for some scenes involving coding and app creation gave advice on staging and dialogue and contributed to the movies closing credits. As one last stamp of approval Google co-founder Sergey Brin turns up in two different cameos. This film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox shows Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn in a scene from ""The Internship."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Phil Bray) ( Phil Bray ) What Google gets in return is a big ol sloppy wet kiss. ""The Social Network"" this aint. By the end of the film you may almost believe that Google is a corporate Shangri-La where the greatest things ever are created for the betterment of all mankind.That is what it looks like to a couple of modern-day Willie Lomans -- Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) -- who suddenly find themselves out of work after years of successfully peddling high-end watches. Its a crushing blow. For one thing they find out that their company has gone belly-up and not from their bosses but from a customer over dinner. Billy gets dumped by his longtime girlfriend and his house is foreclosed. Nick has to take a soul-draining job selling mattresses for his sisters slimy boyfriend (an uncredited Will Ferrell).Advertisement Thats when Billy decides they have only one option get a job at Google -- even though they live in an analog world with no digital skills and at the moment the company isnt hiring. The solution apply for an internship program that guarantees jobs to its top achievers. Somehow these two aging underachievers wheedle their way into the class after a screening interview on Google Hangout. The scene is one of the funniest in the movie as the clueless salesmen vamp their way through the interviewers questions.Amazingly -- or not since there wouldnt be a film otherwise -- Billy and Nick get accepted and head off to Silicon Valley where they quickly realize just how out of their element they are at Google. The other interns all years younger immediately recognize them as digital illiterates who are stuck culturally somewhere around 1985. A big clue Billy persists in evoking the 1983 movie ""Flashdance"" when making what he thinks are inspirational speeches a cultural reference that draws mostly blank stares from the other interns. Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn in a scene from ""The Internship."" ( Phil Bray/20th Century Fox) While director Shawn Levy clearly makes every effort to get the details of Google and its way of life right theres only a surface resemblance to the companys real work world. For one thing the major dramatic device is a series of challenges that will determine which team of interns will get the coveted jobs -- a contest that doesnt happen in the real world. For another one of the challenges has the teams manning phone lines to provide tech support. Seriously? Good luck getting a Google person on the phone in real life.Billy and Nick end up of course on a team of rejects overseen by a mentor/manager (Josh Brener) who seems barely out of high school. They look like sure losers particularly when put up against a team led by an aggressive ambitious and thoroughly nasty intern (Max Minghella). You can guess where all this is going. The real-life experiences of Billy and Nick help carry the day. The older guys learn from the kids and vice versa. Good triumphs over evil. And everybody gets Google-ly.But somehow much -- if certainly not all -- of the film works. Levy largely avoids the cynical and the crude which is refreshing. Some bits are legitimately funny. The cast notably Aasif Mandvi as the leader of the internship program do just fine.Its all just enough to cover flaws such as the occasional misconceived scene some one-dimensional characters and a running time that is about 20 minutes too long. In the end youll probably like ""The Internship"" even if you dont (and shouldnt) love it.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.THE INTERNSHIP   1/2Rating PG-13 (for some language and sexual content)Cast Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Rose Byrne and Max MinghellaDirector Shawn LevyRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

TWITTER Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson reunite in this comedy about a couple of old-time salesmen trying to reinvent themselves at Google. There are a lot of good comic possibilities lurking in Shawn Levys new movie The Internship but most of them never quite break the surface of this mild occasionally likable romp that plays more like a love letter to Google. The companys headquarters is the main setting for this vehicle for Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson who starred in the 2005 box office smash Wedding Crashers. Their new movie wont match the grosses of that raunchy lark but the reunion of the two stars could stir decent business at least for a couple of weeks. Unlike that earlier farce this one is rated PG-13 and seems to be aimed at a slightly older more literate audience. But will they turn out to see a movie marketed to young party animals? STORY Googles Eric Schmidt Says Hollywoods Storytelling Wins in The New Digital Age At the start of the movie Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) lose their jobs selling watches when their boss (John Goodman) informs them that watches have become obsolete in a world where kids use their smart phones to check the time. Billy and Nick are old-fashioned salesmen whose livelihood is threatened by a shrinking economy and a brand new technological universe. For reasons that are never made entirely convincing they decide to apply to an internship program which may lead to permanent jobs at Google. There they find themselves competing with a bunch of much younger applicants who are far more technically savvy than these two ""dinosaurs"" as their retiring boss calls them. But when they land at Google headquarters for the summer their worldliness appeals to their geeky young competitors so we surmise that the two generations may be able to help each other. Those of us who are a bit intimidated by new technology will be tickled by the premise but the movie might have drawn a lot more laughter from the notion of Luddites trying to navigate new digital domains. In one scene Vaughns Billy tries to impress his young colleagues by talking about going ""on the line"" rather than online but thats one of the only effective jokes about old-school salesmen trying to master a whole new lingo. All the applicants are divided into teams and Nick and Billy join a group of computer nerds to compete for a handful of jobs but they have to match wits with much more savvy techies. Although the odds are against them it isnt hard to guess the outcome of the contest. Predictability is not the only problem with the script which was written by Vaughn and Jared Stern. The two stars present an amusing physical contrast but their characters arent very sharply differentiated. Both of them are fast-talking confident hustlers. It would have been more satisfying if they had more distinctive personalities. The same lack of differentiation applies to the nerdy members of their team. Theyre all sheltered whiz kids with few social skills. We long for richer characterizations. The actors do what they can to supply the texture missing from the script. Vaughn and Wilson riff together with pleasing professionalism. Levy has recruited a number of talented newcomers to play the members of Nick and Billys team. Dylan OBrien is the cynical one Josh Brener is the eager beaver and Tobit Raphael is the brainy Asian kid with the Tiger Mom.  Although these characters are one-dimensional the actors nail their parts expertly. Max Minghella gives a smooth performance as the villain of the piece the arrogant Brit who seems to be the favorite to defeat our heroes. In a rare role that allows her to use her native Australian accent Rose Byrne makes a neat romantic foil for Wilson. Goodman Will Ferrell and a few others turn in canny cameo performances. STORY Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson Reunite at The Internship Premiere Art directors skillfully re-create the Google campus though the companys cooperation seems to have given an antiseptic sheen to much of the film. While comedies are meant to move toward a sunny conclusion the best ones have a few more unpredictable twists than this by-the-numbers confection. The hucksters and the nerds bond and help each other to grow. The message is unobjectionable but the storytelling is unimaginative. Losers win the prize squabbling lovers come together and this overlong opus finally reaches a clever end-credit sequence that is the highlight of the picture.

"The Internship Review Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Reteam for Affable Comedy | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Internship Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr June 2 2013 | 1200PM PT Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson reteam for a comedy thats exceedingly affable and good-natured if also undeniably long in the tooth. ""Google Crashers"" must have been the high-concept pitch for ""The Internship"" which reteams ""Wedding Crashers"" stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson for a round of markedly less ribald shenanigans this time as two washed-up Willy Lomans trying to reinvent themselves as tech-sector whiz kids. ""The Social Network"" it isnt -- nor does it try to be -- but this big-hearted underdog comedy from director Shawn Levy is much like its two leads exceedingly affable and good-natured despite being undeniably long in the tooth. Low-key pic faces its own generation-gap standoff at the summer box office where it opens just five days ahead of the more buzzed-about hipster doomsday farce ""This Is the End"" -- a reminder that much has changed in American screen comedy in the eight years since ""Crashers"" racked up a 200-million-plus domestic total. Fittingly for a movie stuffed with 80s pop-culture references (including Vaughns frequent invocations of ""Flashdance"" as an inspirational touchstone) ""The Internship"" often feels like a time-travel or body-switching comedy a la ""Big"" and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" but where nothing supernatural is responsible for stranding Los Angeles watch salesmen Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Wilson) in a world they no longer recognize. Newly downsized (and in Billys case kicked to the curb by his fed-up girlfriend) the two best buds flounder for a while with Nick taking a soul-crushing job selling mattresses for his sisters lecherous boyfriend (an uncredited Will Ferrell). Then Billy hits upon the idea that they should work for Google no matter their collective lack of technological know-how and the fact that Google isnt actually hiring. But the search-engine giant is looking for candidates for a highly competitive summer internship program that guarantees a select number of staff positions to its highest achievers. So the boys enroll themselves in an online university (to qualify as students) and audition for the Google search committee -- a very funny scene staged as a videoconference that makes a fine showcase for both actors considerable improvisational gifts. When they are improbably accepted into the program its off to Silicon Valley and Googles corporate HQ depicted as the happiest workplace on earth complete with driverless cars beach volleyball court adult-sized tunnel slide and gratis employee cafeteria. (In the annals of product-placement cinema no corporate giant has been so fully integrated into a movies very conception since FedEx and ""Cast Away."") There Billy and Nick arent merely square pegs in round holes; theyre like over-the-hill Gullivers stranded in a high-tech Lilliputia the gangly Billy towering over the uniformly bookish slope-shouldered interns who in turn regard him and Nick as mental midgets recruited for diversitys sake -- none more so than Alpha-male a-hole Graham (Max Minghella). Used to being picked first for high-school sports these jocks-out-of-water now find themselves in the reject pile forced to work with a ragtag bunch of similar also-rans in a series of competitive team challenges designed to weed out the best and the brightest from the sea of ""Nooglers."" Its fairly easy to see that in pics grand design Billy and Nicks apparent liabilities will turn out to be assets their real-world life experience and people skills complementing the book smarts of their socially regressed colleagues. But ""The Internship"" gets surprising mileage out of the premise thanks to the infectious chemistry of Wilson and Vaughn and the gallery of equally fine comic performers who back them up including a scene-stealing Aasif Mandvi (as the internship programs whip-cracking leader) the lovely Rose Byrne (as the lovelorn staffer who catches the eye of longtime bachelor Nick) and newcomer Josh Brener as the barely pubescent manager assigned to Nick and Billys team. Indeed given how much ""The Internship"" has going for it its doubly disappointing when the movie sells itself short with dumb unconvincing gags (including one that turns on pop-culture junkies Billy and Nick never having heard of ""X-Men"") and overextended setpieces chiefly a long second-act foray into a San Francisco strip club that seems to have parachuted in from a different movie (and which may offend some of this otherwise family-friendly pics potential audience). Few comedies can sustain a full two hours of screen time without at least partly overstaying their welcome -- Levys 2010 ""Date Night"" clocked in at a lean 88 minutes -- and there is almost surely a tighter sharper 100-minute version of ""The Internship"" lurking somewhere in this current versions 119-minute frame. Still the pics unwavering charm keeps it afloat. Levy who cut his directorial teeth on Disney TV series before going on to steward the lucrative ""Night at the Museum"" and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" franchises doesnt seem to have a cynical or mean-spirited bone in his filmmaking body and theres something finally disarming about ""The Internships"" boundless optimism its belief in the possibility of starting over at 40 and its vision of Google as something like the worlds biggest mom-and-pop business. Who knows if thats really the case -- but hey its only a movie.

For whatever reason its taken the raucous duo eight years to reunite and for whatever reason theyve agreed to do so in a Google commercial disguised as every other campus comedy ever made albeit with party-hearty nonsense and fish-out-of-water antics tempered down to PG-13 levels for maximum mediocrity. Vaughn and Wilson star in ""The Internship"" as Billy and Nick middle-aged manufacturers reps for a wristwatch company abruptly canned having been rendered obsolete by cell phones. Whats worse Billys girlfriend walks away (""You talk a big game"" she shouts) while Nicks sister (""You always play it safe"" she implores) gets him a job with her vulgar husband (Will Ferrell of course) at a mattress showroom. Billys big plan for the both of them? Landing a job at Google... by landing an internship there first... by enrolling in classes online at the University of Phoenix. Why Google? Because Billy hears that theyre the best company in America to work for. Never mind that neither man has any tech savvy to call their own screaming into webcams and mistaking C++ for letter grades. For two schmoes presumably faced with a tough job market -- we never see any other opportunities given so much as a shot -- Billy and Nick have decided to apply to Mt. Everest because they heard it has a great view.  They make their way to San Francisco and Google HQ where they find themselves sneered at by Mr. Chetty (Aasif Mandvi) and Brit bully Graham (Max Minghella) before being lumped together with three leftover candidates (Dylan OBrien Tiya Sircar Tobit Raphael) and dweeby team leader Lile (Josh Brener) all keen on dominating challenges in order to ultimately land full-time positions there. (Well not Lile but the rest.) A full two hours of interminable competition ensues filled to the brim with mainstream pop culture references rendered acceptably geeky by the likes of ""The Big Bang Theory"" (""Star Wars"" ""X-Men"" and Quidditch all play their part) while Wilson and Vaughn stand around and constantly riff in a manner more befitting an ad for Bing than a movie devoted to Google (and boy is it -- I counted 45 mentions of that name and variations thereof like ""Googlers"" and ""Googliness""). The search engine ""single-handedly cuts into my ability to bullst"" Wilson confesses to a workaholic supervisor/requisite love interest (Rose Byrne). For the film its just the opposite with Googles flagrant agenda of world-betterment nearly upstaging the stars at every turn. Even if producer/co-writer Vaughn and director Shawn Levy had opted to set the film at a fictional company the faux-college cliches are still in full swing between Grahams alpha-nerd routine the need for our leads to loosen up their own gang of misfits (Raphael is regrettably saddled with the ""uptight Asian kid with domineering mother"" stereotype while Brener opts for awkward gangsta slang) and the third-act technicality setback. Although Fred Claus and the Butterscotch Stallion do maintain their reliable chemistry their odd-men-out banter hardly rivals the manic inappropriateness of either ""Crashers"" or ""Old School"" before that. (Rob Riggle even puts in an appearance of similar seediness to Will Ferrells role in ""Wedding Crashers"" quite possibly down to the exact minute.) Despite a second-act detour to a strip joint Levy (""Date Night"" the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise) continues to play it safe. In fact ""The Internship"" rivals the aggressively bland ""Larry Crowne"" for sheer tepidness if not worse due to the exhaustive product placement for a company whose real-life presence is unlikely to soon wane. When the biggest laugh in a movie about two fortysomething funnymen going to work for a tech giant is Minghella purring Nelly lyrics in a sauna maybe Google isnt the first thing they should have been searching for.
