Tale of a stymied Indo-Pak love affair doesnt rely on the jingoism found in some recent Bollywood actioners and largely allows its liberal message to emerge from the strong characterizations. Seven years after the smash ""Dil to pagal hai"" vet producer-director Yash Chopra returns to the helm with ""Veer-Zaara"" a full-bore traditional masala-meller with a contempo slant. Tale of a stymied Indo-Pak love affair doesnt rely on the jingoism found in some recent Bollywood actioners and largely allows its liberal message to emerge from the strong characterizations. Though it doesnt quite match recent classics like ""Kabhi khushi kabhie gham"" in sheer technique and production sheen in-depth star casting and thorough entertainment values make this a must-see for Bollywatchers. Much-heralded pic opened worldwide Nov. 12 on some 900 prints (600 of them in India) and has already scored hefty biz. Helped by star Shah Rukh Khans strong appeal to overseas Indian auds first weekend tally in the U.K. on 60 prints was 895000 (slightly higher than ""K3G"") and in the U.S. on 88 prints 900000 (slightly lower). In India where advance bookings have been heavy and soundtrack sales already topped 1 million units film looks likely to run and run. First half is fairly straightforward fare as ex-Indian Air Force officer Veer Pratap Singh (Khan) whos been rotting in a Pakistani jail for 22 years unburdens his memories to rookie human-rights lawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji). Shes a Pakistani taking up his case as part of cross-border detente. Back in the early 80s Veer met rich Pakistani Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta) when her bus crashed on the way to disposing of the ashes of her Indian wet-nurse (Zohra Segal) in the latters hometown. Taking her back to his Punjabi village for a traditional Lodi hoe-down -- an exhilaratingly staged ensemble set piece -- Veer falls for Zaara and shes welcomed by his broadminded uncle and aunt (vets Amitabh Bachchan Hema Malini in light mood). Alas at the train station on her way home Zaara turns out to have a fiance the humorless Raza (Manoj Bajpai) whos come looking for her. The putative lovers are torn apart. Meat of the drama comes post-intermission as Veer is secretly contacted by Zaaras maid Shabbo (Divya Dutta) and urged to rescue Zaara from her forthcoming marriage. When Veer turns up at a Lahore temple and the sweethearts embrace Raza takes a terrible revenge that ends in Veers incarceration. Back in the present amid several twists Saamiya has to fight his case against a government lawyer (Anupam Kher) whos never lost. Zinta the most interesting young actress of her generation is her usual lively self as the willful Zaara and shes balanced on the distaff side by a quietly dignified perf from Mukerji as the Pakistani lawyer who also has something of her own to prove. As Veer Khan fills the screen with his likable presence as always but lacks the gravitas to elevate the Veer-Zaara love story into the timeless Romeo amp; Juliet yarn to which pic aspires. Still the rest of the large cast is aces from Kiron Kher as Zaaras understanding mom to Dutta as her devoted maid. Production design is lavish without overwhelming the characters with the Pakistani element providing a fresh look. Editing is trim and agile and visual effects in the final number (morphing between the leads young and old) are impressively smooth though colors in the exterior shots had a slightly washed-out look in print caught. As a point of interest song score derives from an unused bank of tunes written by the late Madan Mohan a hitmeister of the 50s to 70s ""recreated"" by Sanjeev Kohli. While not instantly hummable they do the job effectively. Veer-ZaaraIndia ProductionA Yash Raj Films release of a Yash Raj Films production. (International sales Yash Raj Mumbai.)

too naive to assume how mr .yash chopra conceives the illustrious punjabi culture but in his great classic which was a really sincere attempt to bring the two warring nations together we got to see a masterful portrayal of punjabi men and women who could easily beat the great horse and cattle shows into oblivion as the men from punjab were reduced to the intelligectual level of oxen while the women behaved like decked out cows in a prize winning cattle show and if it was not enough we also had some great legal minds and some great geographical discoveries afoot which even will put christopher columbus to shame . our lovely zara played by the matchless zinta kicks the epic of by enacting great melody which declares proudly that she is a 2 year old retard and she plays the part faithfully and with astonishing skills right to the finale if you want to absolutely want to know the song it was like i am a real dumb little girl and i will always be the same after the song finishes her hindu nanny is so shocked she drops dead instanteously at her inefficincy and incompetence at bringing up miss retard now it is incumbent for poor lil retard to take her nannys ashes to india as all the sacred waters are there though they all flow ultimately enter pakistan to flow into arabian sea but the geography of punjab is better known to miss retard so next we have the poor little billionaire daughter running off in a bus to india some 30 years ago when the two countries had just finished fighting the bloody 1971 venture but of course since our underworld bollywood connections are unquestionable so mr yash chopra has no problems shipping his retarded lady to chamba from where she rings her mother every day to tell her what she has had for dinner and breakfast toobut wait a second she initially ends up with a busload of passengers and our charming rookie indian pilot makes his entry as spiderman to rescue her from the inacessible ditch by hanging upside down rom his chopper now SRK LIKE HIS ACROBATICS and will do anything for ms retard and yash uncle so miss muuffet is rescued by the charming spiderman and immediately falls in love too as the rest of the passengers are dying around them and the poor nannys ashes are forgotten but then if her memory was good she would not be retarded and we would be deprived of the two great romantic duets that are subsequently going to entertain us into the heights of boredom but dont worry our dashing veer jawan is now on his way to intro the pakistamni miss muffet to his poor relations who turn out to be none other then the demented drunk played deferentially with deftful dementia by amitabh as a loony sikh who has a bejewelled biwi from the south played by soulful sincerity by hema malini as they try to destroy all credibility they gained previously in bagban we have enough time to start an educational reformatary program in hindu land by the retarded miss muffet and that too for the poor little sikh girls who would otherwise have gone without any wisdom incurred upon them by miss retard two more songs and we suddenly find half of pakistan is looking for miis lost little muffet in india and the big bad soider arrives to frighten miss muffet away to pakiland in the form of an evil mr bajpaiwhile poor little rookie pilot can only sing a sad song  never mind because now ms retard has to marry the big bad spider and she dreams of the nice hindu pilot while her father who survived her journey to india decides to have a heart attack anyway as the marriage and songs progress our veerjawan is smuggled into pakistan from india by the bollywood underworld and he decides to meet miss zaera at a shrine in lahore where they embrace each other in the middle of the holy gathering while all the holy men cheer on except mr black spider who decides to frame mr rookie to accept some inexplicable offence to imprison him in pakiland for life while he ias still supposed to be travelling on a bus back to india which again conveniently crashes in explicably in the mountain range whic mr chopra discovered recently enroute from lahore to amritsir ore maybe the bus driver was taking the long route from lahore through gilgit on his way to china to see the great wall before getting back to india  but no worries as our hero is safe as prisoner no.786in a paki jail while the demented drunk and bejeweled biwi are informed he is dead without a corpse i.d . and decide to pass away as i think they decide they have had enough of this indo -pak friendship bridge which keeps crashing with buses regularly . by the way mr bachan is well known to no786 as mr chopra gave him the name in his first classic in the 70s but now the lucky bill is given to veerjawan who gaurds the honour of his retarded paki muslim miss muffet for 20 years before we have the rani of pakistan coming to his rescue as rani mukerjee herself who for some bizarre reason has inacessible access as rani the queen to all pakistani secret prisons including the nuke reactor but she is only interested in reuniting missretard and mr rookey who are now wearing really bad makeups and awful wigs to make them look gracefully aged . what follows is another horse and cattle show in a pakistani high court with rani giving soms symbolic sermons to exorcise how good the pakis and indians are and ever problem is resolved as the geriatric couple sing another duet in the court room itself before being pardoned by the retarded judge who apologises to the poor little pilot who in response recites a poem which is supposed to pull at the heartstrings of all good indians ad pakistanis unfortunately my brain was fried by this time because of the above events and my heartstrings were broken by the verseless decapatitations of the great maestro mada mohans erstwhile melodies by some mindless composer while lata tried her best to rescue them but without gulzar or kaifi azmi that was as difficult as crossing the border between india and pakitan even today but since all bollywood epic by johars and chopras are based on miraculous scripts secondary to allahs and bhagwans blessings mr rookie took ms retard as his wife home crossing the wagah border on foot as no bus driver was prepared to transport the hazardous couple they do say third time lucky but then the bus drivers are too clever in indopak to believe that urban legend but may god bless this great union between the two great nations and fulfil mr chopras dream of one day making a realistic and credible epic till then we can watch mr johar making his epics with the great sets and costumes which mr bhansali is so inspired by as well now enjoy the heatrendingretarded tale of the retards and may the retards live happily ever after madan mohans great music and some good acting by rani-shahrukh are the only two good things along with the photography -otherwise forget it compliments usman khawaja

FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Notre Musique Documentary-drama. Starring Sarah Adler Simon Eine and Jean-Luc Godard. Written and directed by Godard. (In French and Spanish with English subtitles. Not rated. 79 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). Exercising the prerogative of a director who appears in his own movie Jean-Luc Godard gives himself the best scene in ""Notre Musique"" a lumpy mix of real-life and fictional events that shows age hasnt diminished the famed filmmakers zeal to experiment. In the documentary portion Godard captures himself pontificating to students in Sarajevo. Its a mind-boggling lecture -- jumping from the visions of Bernadette to the vision of director Howard Hawks whom Godard claims saw no difference between men and women. He illustrates with slides of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in virtually identical shots from Hawks ""His Girl Friday."" ""Truth has two faces"" Godard says stopping just short of exclaiming ""Eureka"" The students dutifully take notes which surely will require some head-scratching to decipher. Like Godards overstuffed talk his latest movie suffers from an excess of ideas that are hard to sort out. Using Dantes model ""Notre Musique"" is divided into three parts. The first hell is a hellish montage of war images some real some taken from movies such as ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Kiss Me Deadly. "" The devastation suffered by American Indians figures prominently and to connect the dots they reappear in part two purgatory when Israeli journalist Judith (Sarah Adler) imagines them in tribal headdresses reclaiming the land stolen from them. Like Michael Moore Godard makes no attempt to hide his political leanings but he tilts too far in this unintentionally laughable fantasy sequence. Judith is in Sarajevo to track down the French ambassador (Simon Eine) and tell him shes the daughter of the baby born in his garret during World War II when he provided refuge for a Jewish couple trapped in Vichy France. Their exchange during a reception for a cigar-smoking Godard and fellow speakers at a literary conference is conceived as a dramatic high point with Judith pressuring the diplomat to be interviewed about the Palestinian situation from the perspective of a Nazi resister. But Adler and Eine play the scene flatly and theres little emotional payoff when the ambassador resists the request out of fear that anything he says would become a diplomatic cause celebre. Its not even clear whose side a die-hard liberal is supposed to be on. A far more intriguing brief encounter occurs at the same party. As one hostess serves champagne to a professor he unexpectedly grabs her hand and they begin to dance. Their spin around the room recalls a famous scene in Godards 1964 ""Band of Outsiders"" -- back when he was still making breathless cinema -- of three bar patrons spontaneously doing a line dance called the Madison. (Quentin Tarantino paid homage to this celebrated celluloid moment by having Uma Thurman do the Madison in ""Pulp Fiction."") The few movies Godard has made in recent years arent big on fun although ""Notre Musique"" does conclude in heaven imagined as a surreally bright green forest. When you start in hell theres no way to go except up. -- Advisory This film contains brutal war scenes. - Ruthe Stein Alone in the Dark Action-horror. Starring Christian Slater Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff. Directed by Uwe Boll. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). ""Alone in the Dark"" is the best Ed Wood movie never made. It fails so miserably as both an action and horror picture that it succeeds as a comedy. Its a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality. Just how bad/good is this movie? Perpetual Maxim cover girl Tara Reid not only plays an archaeologist but she also utters the phrase ""I need to study these artifacts"" and on multiple occasions saves the good guys by translating ancient American Indian scripture. No Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie do not show up to perform brain surgery in ""Alone in the Dark"" but you will fully expect to find that deleted scene on the DVD. The movie begins with an incredibly long scroll of text explaining a backstory involving a portal to another dimension an unspeakable evil and orphans who were used as scientific experiments. Just when you think every possible cliche has been used in the first five minutes Christian Slater shows up as one of those orphans who has grown up to become a loose-cannon member of a paranormal investigation team and gets thrown off the job. From the moment Slater appears its clear this movie is going to be telling-your-friends-about-it-the-next-day weird. For starters the ""Pump up the Volume"" star dresses as if hes raided the wardrobe truck from an early 1990s Jean-Claude Van Damme movie running through most of ""Alone in the Dark"" in a black ribbed tank top jeans and brown leather trench coat. At least half of the actors dialogue appears to have been written for the movie poster tagline. (""Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive"") The rest of his lines are delivered in sporadic voice-overs which seem to have been added in postproduction to spackle in the giant plot holes created by director Uwe Boll. Lets talk about Boll. What the young director has created here is more of a drinking game than a movie with scenes that are not only laughably bad but also repeat themselves. A team of soldiers blows up a hallway full of priceless artwork. (Take a drink.) Reid uses a four-syllable science word when its clear from her confused delivery that she has no idea what it means. (Drink.) Slater utters yet another cryptic line about his fear of the dark. (Drink.) Seriously Boll appears to have one goal here and thats convincing Tim Burton to film a biopic about him. ""Alone in the Dark"" is the directors second movie based on a video game and he has at least two more on the way. But no one could create anything this weird without someone else with an established background in bad cinema. And sure enough the credits list screenwriter Elan Matsai who also wrote a film called ""MVP2 Most Vertical Primate."" This movie gets an empty chair but it just as easily could have received a clapping guy and probably would have if there were any acknowledgement in the production notes that the whole thing was supposed to be a joke. Add a few oral sex jokes and replace the actors with marionettes and ""Alone in the Dark"" could end up with rave reviews as a sequel to ""Team America World Police."" While the movie isnt quite bad enough to be considered the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of the 21st century its not overstating matters to call ""Alone in the Dark"" this generations ""C.H.U.D."" Every casting decision camera angle special effect and sound seems created as a dare to leave the theater. The fight choreography appears to have been taken from an episode of ""Lost in Space"" the musical score sounds as if it were composed on a 1983 Casio keyboard bought at a garage sale and even the extras seem as if they were selected for their background incompetence. On second thought you probably need to see this movie for yourself. If nothing else its worth the bargain-matinee price to watch Slater utter the line ""Theres a price to pay for bringing darkness back into the light."" (Drink.) -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence body mutilation and bad dialogue. - Peter Hartlaub Veer-Zaara Drama. Starring Shahrukh Khan Preity Zinta Rani Mukerji Kirron Kher Divya Dutta Boman Irani and Anupam Kher. Directed by Yash Chopra. (In Hindi with English subtitles. Not rated. 192 minutes plus intermission. At the Balboa Theater.). An epic love story thats also an astute commentary on India-Pakistan relations ""Veer-Zaara"" is a three-hour flurry across countries time and matters of the heart. Technically speaking the film is a Bollywood production (which means the characters break into song on occasion) but the acting drama plot twists and cinematography can be compared (favorably) to that of many major Western productions from Saul Zaentzs ""The English Patient"" to Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""A Very Long Engagement."" ""Veer-Zaara"" begins in a lush countryside where a handsome couple -- Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) and Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta) -- are frolicking. Obviously in love they seem to be living in paradise -- except that its a flashback to what was. What is Singh languishes in a Pakistani jail where hes been locked up for 22 years. We learn that Singh was a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force and that Khan is from a prominent Muslim family in Pakistan. They met when Khan took a trip to India to spread the ashes of her beloved Sikh nanny. As Singh sits on the cold prison floor a Pakistani lawyer named Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji) comes in and vows to win his release from the silent hell his life has become. Director Yash Chapor one of Bollywoods most cherished figures uses flashbacks to tell the story of Singhs and Khans unexpected romance. Road blocks to their relationship were set in place from the beginning. Besides being from countries that have fought three wars Singh and Khan have roots in different religions Khan is already engaged to a Pakistani man whom her father has decreed she marry and Singhs connection to the Indian military makes him a target of suspicion among certain Pakistanis. Still their love is so strong that its obvious to anyone who sees them -- including Khans mother and Singhs surrogate parents. Two decades later the overriding question is this Can Siddiqui a female lawyer working on her first case figure out the mystery of Khans imprisonment (and overcome the prejudice of misogynistic jailers and a rival lawyer)? ""Veer-Zaara"" is so arresting its scenes so full of beauty and colors that the three hours go by almost too fast. While Bollywood films have had a mixed reception in the United States this one deserves a wide audience. A film that lets audiences see the humanity in characters who represent ""the other"" -- and does it in a way thats dramatic funny fun silly musical stylish romantic and redemptive -- is a film worth telling your friends and neighbors about. - Jonathan Curiel Fear X Thriller. Starring John Turturro James Remar and Deborah Kara Unger. Written by Nicolas Winding Refn and Hubert Selby Jr. and directed by Refn. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Roxie.). The truth sometimes will not set you free. So discovers a mall security guard (a subtle John Turturro) when he goes in search of the man who murdered his wife in this quietly effective thriller. Nicolas Winding Refn the films youthful Danish director was fortunate enough to secure the services of the inspired musician Brian Eno whose spare synthesized score along with restrained camera work anchor the movie. The most compelling scenes show Turturros lonely haunted character Harry at home obsessed with trying to piece together the mystery of his wifes death. Harry lives in a dream state of sorts one minute examining surveillance videos for evidence of the murder the next having chilling visions of his wife in a nearby room. It makes for unsettling stuff -- and certainly deserves a better title than the lame ""Fear X."" Things for Harry get more complicated -- and muddled -- when he leaves wintry gloomy Wisconsin to track down the killer in wintry gloomy Montana. The people Harry asks questions of arent especially keen to answer and he stays in a spooky hotel whose red walls and carpeting should have been warning enough that he just might be entering a situation thats straight out of ""The Shining."" Though it was co-written by Hubert Selby Jr. (the author of ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" who died last year) the story in the end is less than satisfying and unfortunately doesnt match the movies eerie style. -- Advisory This film contains violent scenes. - John McMurtrie Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

For its home audience in India this romance (with the requisite splashy musical numbers) is a Romeo and Juliet story about partition and tolerance; the heroine is Pakistani and the hero Indian. It is also a teaming of three of Indias biggest movie stars guided by the 72-year-old Pakistani-born Indian director Yash Chopra.The love story a long flashback begins in Lahore Pakistan with our perky rich-girl ingenue Zaara Hayat Khan (Preity Zinta) singing and dancing around the house like Ann-Margret in ""Bye Bye Birdie"" about how she is never going to change her style for anybody. She is about to get engaged to a man chosen by her prominent politically ambitious father but shell think about that later.Meanwhile our salt-of-the-earth hero Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) a handsome helicopter pilot with the Indian Air Force is busy rescuing people stranded in the mountains. The two might never have met if Zaaras Sikh nanny had not died exacting a promise that her ashes be immersed in her native India. When Zaaras bus crashes on her way to keep that promise she is among the passengers Veer rescues. After an initial misunderstanding he joins her on her sentimental mission and takes her home to meet the family (conveniently its a holiday).Amitabh Bachchan is charm personified in a special appearance as the uncle who brought up Veer. In the course of one day Veer and Zaara fall in intense irrevocable karmic-destiny-transcending love although Zaara doesnt fully realize it until her hideous fiance meets her at the train station. After that the gods test the young lovers things get ridiculously melodramatic and people behave so nobly that moviegoers may want to scream. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For once that thundering soap-opera music (which makes a Douglas Sirk movie score seem subtle) is welcome; it drowns out any embarrassing audience sniffles.When Veer finishes telling his story his novice lawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee the films third megastar) vows to prove his innocence and the movie turns into a courtroom drama. During a recess Saamiya goes off on a Perry Mason-style evidence-collecting trip which yields a highly satisfying surprise ending.Seasoned Bollywood fans will be in heaven so to speak. Other American moviegoers who find the Indian film industrys tastes a little over the top may not be able to get past cinematic devices that seem shamefully obvious but over-the-top is part of the fun. In Bollywood a single musical number can move through a dozen different settings with as many glamorous wardrobe changes. It also seems to rain a lot during musical numbers (some strange Gene Kelly influence?). When Saamiya asks of the star-crossed lovers ""What century are these people from?"" she means it as a compliment. Yet the cultural assumptions of Veer and Zaara add a welcome element of freshness for American audiences. When Zaaras mother reminds her daughter that women always love fully with heart and soul she casually adds ""Men dont have the strength to love like that.""Veer-Zaara Opens nationwide today.Directed by Yash Chopra; written (in Hindi with English subtitles) by Aditya Chopra; director of photography Anil Mehta; edited by Ritesh Soni; music by Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar; choreography by Saroj Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant; production designer Sharmishta Roy; produced by Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra; released by Yash Raj Films.
