Facebook Twitter Print General topics Horror Show Prisoners Insidious Chapter 2 mom-swapping and more things that go bump in the night by Wesley Morris on September 20 2013 Fear at the movies is like water earth or air. Its elemental. Horror movies are the ideal format to exploit that fear. They make their living off the worst-case scenario death. Often that fear feasts on adolescents and the horny. But its most relentlessly focused on the family. ""Obsessed"" might be the more accurate word. A child fears losing a parent -- to Satan to bogeymen to ghosts to insanity. The parent fears losing a child. Sometimes one simply fears what the other has become -- a child demon and an ax-swinging monster. Scary movies dramatize that terror and exploit that dread -- with tales of possession and abduction and backstabbing literal and otherwise. This month is a bonanza for that kind of family horror movie. There are at least four variations playing in movie theaters right now. Prisoners is the starriest of them and the least convincing by a wide margin (and thats with one of the four movies -- Adore -- being about two mothers who sleep with each others sons). Prisoners concocts a classic nightmare scenario. Two married couples in a sleepy Pennsylvania town celebrate Thanksgiving together. After dinner each couples younger child -- little girls 6 and 7 years old -- go off to play and never return. The police are brought in and a young detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. A suspicious young suspect named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is taken into custody and released. Alex wears windowpane glasses doesnt appear to have washed his hair in weeks and mumbles so softly that I actually found myself leaning forward whenever he opened his mouth. Even the cops know this kid is too obvious to be true. Surely theyve seen Peter Lorre in say M Kevin Spacey in Se7en and whatever it was that Stanley Tucci was doing in The Lovely Bones. For the father of one of the girls letting Alex go must be some kind of farce. His name is Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). Hes some kind of carpenter-survivalist-truck driver and hes in-effing-tense. Outside the police station Keller incites an altercation with Alex upsetting the boys aunt (Melissa Leo) and causing a scene. When Alex continues his movie-lunatic tribute and whispers something to his assailant Keller explodes some more. With Alex free Keller decides to kidnap him and chain him up inside an abandoned apartment building across town where his plan is to torture him until he breaks. Jackman is still in his phase of high-masculine misery. He has snuffed out the joy that made him a star. He just wants to brood now but its unbecoming. Jackman lacks the lightness that say Mel Gibson could bring to despair. Hes drawn to this idea of vengeance and suffering as rites of maleness. So its good-bye to subtlety and hello to growling in every single scene. The entire performance is an exclamation point and he swings it like a baseball bat. Kellers captive is a secret he keeps from the police his teenage son (Dylan Minnette) and his wife (Maria Bello) who spends the movie depressed on a diet of prescription pills. He chooses to share his poor decision with Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) his friend and the father of the other missing girl. (Viola Davis plays Mrs. Birch.) Theyre men of so many ostensible differences (in class temperament and taste) that youd really like to know what binds their families close enough to make them the sole participants of the biggest meal of the year. The director of Prisoners Denis Villeneuve furnishes this movie with just the right balance of ominous atmosphere and gingerly pacing -- it lasts a highly watchable two and a half hours. He gets considerable help from Roger Deakins whose cinematography gives smoothness and art to the prevailing sense of doom. He can really do wonders with the motif of framing images through windows. A character is photographed seated beside a broken sink so that the sink comes to resemble his head and state of mind. Villeneuve is much better when the images speak than when the characters do. He shares David Finchers affinity for fraying soundscapes and chic-looking apocalypse. He also shares the indifference to being human that made Fincher such a frustrating filmmaker for the first half of his career. The people in Prisoners arent props but they arent entirely people either. Some of the matter is Aaron Guzikowskis screenplay. If you happen to be unlucky enough to figure this movie out after 30 minutes youre stuck rolling your eyes at bad behavior and red herrings. The film is a horror procedural that thinks its an emotional drama. A lot of the action involves Gyllenhaals Detective Loki poking around town and sitting around thinking. You in turn are free to take in his slicked-back hair assorted tattoos and dress shirts buttoned up to the neck and wonder how this hipster wound up a detective in Nowhereville PA. Gyllenhaal appears to know who this guy is and that is almost enough. (""Loki"" though shouldnt be a name that inspires confidence but were assured that he has never not solved a case.) Theres just not enough dramatically on the other side of this movie. Howard and Davis and Bello dont have anything rewarding to do. These are actors too good for their underwritten roles especially Howard and Davis who when asked to complicate the movies moral muck do so with moving complexity. The problem is that you dont believe any of it. We dont know who any of these people are before the girls go missing and the suspense of their absences clarifies little. Keller hunts animals (the film opens with him and his boy shooting the Thanksgiving deer). Daviss character a veterinarian saves them. Theres one moment in which those competing roles threaten to create tension but its dropped. Prisoners is a nutso thriller that inadvertently extends the cable-news narrative that more highly values suffering caused by missing white children than suffering over missing black ones. That imbalance becomes all the more untenable once Keller invites Franklin to accompany him to his homemade jail. Howard is the wrong actor for this kind of reluctant complicity. He can perform it but youre always thinking hed have to know that Jackman must be stopped. That or hed have to go further in than he does. But could we handle a movie in which a black man tortures a white kid until he gets his daughter back? At a relatively cheap 30 million Prisoners can afford to be a little crazy (the finale pulls a hamstring straining for ""nuts"") but not that crazy. You can tell this is a marketplace movie. The more audacious film would have put Davis and Howard in Jackmans and Bellos roles. Theyre the stronger actors. I might have rolled my eyes at that idea before seeing Prisoners because going in itd be hard to believe that a movie could go out of its way to underuse them. Each couple loses a daughter but the story turns into a vehicle for Jackmans rage. This could very easily have been the story of the hole a missing child leaves in two homes. It just applies spackle. Adore is nuts too. Its just as subtlety-averse as Prisoners. But the movie resigns itself to the ludicrousness of its situation and thats actually more chilling. Adore doesnt have a genre to hide in -- or many clothes for that matter. Its just two longtime best friends -- Lil (Naomi Watts) and Roz (Robin Wright) -- in a New South Wales beach town. They find themselves in love with each others sons and the sons (Xavier Samuel plays Lils; James Frecheville plays Rozs) find themselves hopelessly obsessed too. The movie feels shorter than it is. You have the inherent juiciness to thank for that. Christopher Hampton took this plot from Doris Lessings novella The Grandmothers and director Anne Fontaine turns the sexiness up all the way to ""schwing."" This is trash that doesnt care to be more. Lil is the unstable one. Roz is altruistically devoted. The friends affect some mock panic about their sexuality (""Were not lezzos. Are we?""). The possibility exists that the exchange of sons is really the closest these two can get to sex with each other. And yet whatever psychology there is comes exclusively from Wattss heat and Wrights cool. Fontaine tries for insinuating Ingmar Bergman framing and lands at ABBA. Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons werent built like surfers? Of course she wouldnt have. She knows that the all-around hotness of the participants settles your stomach. It just leaves her with an enjoyably shallow movie. The boys wind up marrying other women and the movies lack of transition or developed characters lets the truth come as a shock to everyone but the predators -- I mean perpetrators. The movie which is in theaters and available on demand hooks you because the fear it awakens is dumb and plausible at the same time. Now a wifes oedipal nightmare can include her mother-in-laws BFF That was the gist of Lessings story. Here its an afterthought. The movie doesnt care about the wives. What youre left with is a horror film with the helium heartlessness of a nighttime soap opera The Carnality of Evil. Supernatural horror movies usually dont make any sense. Half the time Im not sure their makers even know what theyre up to. But the director James Wan and the screenwriter Leigh Whannell have made enough horror thrillers separately and together (the first Saw and Dead Silence were theirs; Wan made this summers sleeper hit The Conjuring) to have figured out how to keep improving them. Insidious Chapter 2 works according to its own logic and its fun watching the movies hokey premise come together in the final act. You stick with it in part because Wan is confident enough with his staging to actually use the camera frame to tell a story. Most of his peers shoot a bunch of scenes and let the editor make a smoothie. Wan no longer relies on visual gibberish. He has become a classicist in that sense. This is a possession movie starring the characters from the original hit from two years ago. This time focus is on Josh (Patrick Wilson) and the killer ghost that wants to take him over and use him to slay his wife (Rose Byrne) mother (Barbara Hershey) and sons (Ty Simpkins and Andrew Astor). Josh and his elder boy Dalton both have some kind of extrasensory perception which the father has suppressed and the boy is struggling to ignore. But this movie argues that the problem with ESP isnt seeing the dead its the dead seeing you. Theyre so needy. Chapter Two is a good time and a cheesy one too. Red blares from all the decor like a siren. Its in the ironwork the sofas the lampshades and the walls. You cant believe that a home this rife with unhappy souls would also have a pane of scarlet stained glass in a staircase window but thats the kind of movie this is. Theres also the acting of Steve Coulter and the wonderful Lin Shaye as a couple of veteran paranormal experts. These two give this movie its earnest late-70s 1980s soul. I appreciate the ongoing teamwork required of Hershey who has scenes with Byrne and Wilson but also with Angus Sampson and Whannell as ghost-hunting geeks. Oh and theres indoor floor fog too Whats confusing about most possession thrillers is confusing here as well Why? How? Who? Who else? Whos that? But the movie uses humor production design and horror allusions to keep the nonsense within the realm of its own logic. It doesnt quite scare you but its got some not-entirely-cheap moments that goose you. At some point Byrne puts her hands over her mouth and pretty much over her ears. I didnt see her put them over her eyes. But the night I saw this some easy-to-scare girls to my left did that for her. By a wide margin Chapter 2 was no. 1 at the box office last weekend which isnt saying much. Horror films are the cat videos of the U.S. film industry They cant be denied. But this is one of the few whose popularity makes sense. The most terrifying movie now playing has no chance at that kind of success not only because it doesnt have the clever marketing of the Insidious movies but because its transparency feels too real. Blue Caprice reenacts the killing spree of the so-called D.C. sniper and imagines the year or so before two men sat in a cobalt-blue Chevy and killed 10 strangers. Alexandre Moorss film proceeds with a steadily ominous air. It uses music to foster an atmosphere of dread that starts on Caribbean sands and ends with a prison interview. Moors opens with panicked calls to 911 and footage of the crime scenes. The film sums up the entire arc in minutes then jumps backward to Antigua where Lee Boyd Malvo (Tequan Richmond) meets John Allen Muhammad (Isaiah Washington). More than an hour passes before they begin picking off strangers in parking lots and at gas stations. During that time youre watching an apparently mentally ill man seduce a sullen virtually parentless child into a life of crime by dangling the promise of paternity. Washington works with a commanding magnetism. Richmond performs with a difficult blend of innocence menace and steel. Presenting a pair of demons in a manner that doesnt demonize black men is a delicate achievement. It puts us inside their heads but doesnt dare ask us to walk in their shoes. The shootings on Monday at a Washington Navy installation probably make this the wrong time for a director to ask you to remember similar wickedness. But theres a respectful ominousness in the films beauty. I wrote about that after seeing Blue Caprice in January and havent forgotten it. Its the scariest thing Ive seen in a theater in a long time and one of the best films of the year. This is Moorss first feature and he knows what hes doing. The observational coolness has a gathering force. The movie speculates that Muhammad was angry about an ex-wife keeping him from his children. But it doesnt build a bridge from his domestic woes to his act of terror because it cant. Moors instead just allows the images to speak on their own. None speaks more chillingly than those of that title Chevy. Whether its dancing on gravel like a bull about to charge or its taillights are glowing satanically on the interstate you feel its evil. Moors seems to be working from a sense of moral duty more than conventional artistry. He amplifies your sense of fear. You spend the movie afraid of the viciousness both on the screen and beyond it.

"Prisoners - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Prisoners Posted by Christy Lemire on September 22 2013 68 Comments Warner Bros. R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout. Running time 146 minutes. Two stars out of four. ""Prisoners"" has heavy-duty arthouse pretensions but if were being honest with each other its really just a high-falutin B-grade kidnap thriller. Its got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck -- to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being About Something. But if you strip away the pedigree of the people involved in front of and behind the camera whats left is a twisty kidnap picture filled with all the obligatory creepy suspects red herrings and icky imagery. Director Denis Villenueve also tries to add an air of importance by dragging out the developments in this police procedural for a good solid half-hour longer than necessary. The French-Canadian filmmaker is one of the many Oscar nominees at work here -- for 2011s ""Incendies"" about a Quebecois woman who travels to her mothers Middle Eastern homeland after her death to uncover the mystery of her life. As in that foreign-language film Villenueve creates a creeping sense of dread. You wont know where ""Prisoners"" is going for the duration but it could have been even more gripping if it had been tighter. Instead the characters in Aaron Guzikowskis script have the same conversations with each other over and over and usually with increasing volume. This is especially true of our star Hugh Jackman as the father whos understandably desperate to find his little girl after shes abducted on Thanksgiving. Jackmans Keller Dover establishes himself early and often as a man of rigidity and principle from the Christian pop he plays in his pickup truck to the impeccably and thoroughly stocked basement he maintains in his familys rural Pennsylvania home. When the apocalypse comes he will be ready on all fronts. All that prudence goes out the window in a hurry when his 6-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and her close friend Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) daughter of the Dovers neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) disappear while the two families are wrapping up their holiday celebration. (Maria Bello co-stars as Kellers wife Grace who essentially stays drugged up in bed all day after the kidnapping to block out the reality of the familys horrible fate.) All signs would point to a dilapidated RV seen earlier on the families quiet street which may as well have the personalized license plate of PERVERT. Curious the girls had been climbing on it. When police track it down later that night and find that the driver is a dim-witted man-child theyre certain they have their man. Paul Dano finds yet another eerie loner-weirdo in his repertoire as the suspect Alex Jones which is evident the second we see his stringy hair nerdy wardrobe and oversized eyeglasses. But Jake Gyllenhaal as a lead investigator known only as Detective Loki is an eerie loner-weirdo of a different kind. While Jackman overacts in big showy ways bringing menacing elements of both Wolverine AND Jean Valjean to the role Gyllenhaal overacts in the opposite direction. Hes trying awfully hard to be quiet and quirky his performance consisting of nervous blinks neck tats and the slicked-back hair and buttoned-up shirt of a gang member. (Or perhaps a reformed one; Loki makes a passing allusion to having spent time in a Christian boys camp.) When Loki finds he must let Alex go because theres nothing to charge him with Keller goes ballistic and takes the law into his own hands. He becomes a kidnapper himself squirreling Alex away in his late fathers abandoned apartment and beating the crap out of him for information. Basically he does everything shy of waterboarding the guy which as we know from the movies -- depending on your perception of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- may or may not actually work. Eventually he goes so far as to build a makeshift holding cell inside the apartments shower -- Keller is a contractor you see -- hoping that a combination of claustrophobia and scalding-hot water will persuade him to talk. But he also hates himself for such cruelty. The Birches know what Keller is doing but feel conflicted about whether to help him or report him (Howard and Davis are criminally underused in hang-wringing roles). Meanwhile the usually efficient Loki feels frustrated by his inability to solve this particular case. Grace lays in bed all day sleeping and crying. Melissa Leo unsettling as Alexs protective aunt is stuck in a time warp of loneliness since her husbands death. And somewhere out there are a couple of scared little girls being held against their will. You see? Everyones trapped. Were all PRISONERS. Its very profound. But the visuals from the great cinematographer Roger Deakins a 10-time Oscar nominee himself (who should have won this year finally for ""Skyfall"") maintain a beautifully bleak sense of foreboding throughout. A couple of moments are especially striking a slab of light across Alexs eyes from inside the darkness of his cell and the mess of blood and raindrops obscuring Lokis vision as he makes a climactic dash to the hospital. Deakins manages to break free of the films self-serious sense of restraint in ways that are superior to the film itself. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal kidnapping Maria Bello Paul Dano Roger Deakins Terrence Howard thriller Viola Davis 68 Comments on ""Prisoners"" September 22 2013  by  Russell Dee     What a joke This is the best movie of the year so far. And youre one of the few people in the world who doesnt like it. This movie reminds me of another great movie ""No country for old men"" because of its emphasis on artistic details like imagery and character development. This movie like ""No country for old men"" is really about something much bigger than the actual front-and-center story-line and if you had a lick of sense youd realize that. The front-and-center kidnap story is really just the vehicle the director uses to take the viewer on a fascinating emotional roller-coaster ride which he does masterfully. Yes the actual front-and-center kidnap story is pretty common but this movie feels anything but common due to its artistic perfection. ""Prisoners is an amazing spectacle and I cant imagine another movie thats coming out this year having any chance of wrestling the Oscar from this movie. Reply September 29 2013  by  garlynne     You are an unsophisticated ignoramus to think this movie is good. This utterly repugnant cinematic diarrhea hasnt any redeeming qualities. Its ugly incoherent slow and dreary. There are way to many plot twists red-herring and implausible scenes. Reply October 2 2013  by  Russell Dee     garlynne I think the movie went over your head and it is NOT incoherent. When I saw it the first time I thought that a few parts seemed disjointed and a waste of time but I just saw it a 2nd time and now that I have its clear that all of the parts that I thought were unrelated are actually all related. The corpse in the priests house is the runaway husband of the female killer and the one disturbed guy who shot himself at the police station and had all the snakes in suitcases at this house is one of the persons that was kidnapped by the female killer and her husband (who ended up a corpse in the priests basement). Reply November 16 2013  by  AaronA     Having interconnected plot threads does not mean that they intersect in interesting ways. The minute Jake Gyllenhaal found the body I knew that it was going to be Paul Danos Father and was actively hoping for it not to be the case. The director and the actors are really trying to transcend the B grade Thriller script they were given. If they had let the director rewrite the script as he would have been able to improve on the existing material like he did with Incendies. Reply November 16 2013  by  peter solari     I saw PRISONERS for free last night. My friend loved it. I thought that the very graphic brutality was way over the top and overdone. I wont recommend PRISONERS to any body unless he loves graphic violence in film. The producers writer director know that the young audience grew up on graphic cruelty in movies so give that audience what they apparently want-more and more graphic horror. PRISONERS is as bad as 12 YEARS A SLAVE but in a different way Reply September 22 2013  by  JozieLee     Tho it may be a completely different story the trailer reminds me of the recent Ohio Kidnap victims - Michelle Knight Gina DeJesus Amanda Berry. That horror is too fresh in my mind. Cant separate fiction from reality. Doubt if Ill have the stomach to see PRISONERS. Reply September 24 2013  by  Russell Dee     Its a great movie Jozie. I wouldnt lie. You will be entertained by this movie in the sense that you are going to pay attention and you will not be bored. I am not saying that its always pleasant but I am saying that it grabs your attention and keeps it. You are not going to doze off. This movie is very stimulating. I love the end. Reply October 8 2013  by  Jake West     For goodness sakes dont. Im a guy that likes horror classics but I wanted to cry for the mentally handicapped guy in glasses. The movie has no heroes to root for really except the victims. Reply September 22 2013  by  Farty     Your review sucks. This is one of the best films of the year. Reply September 23 2013  by  Russell Dee     You are right. This is a GREAT movie and 90% of the people who have seen this movie agree with you and I. The people who dont agree with you are the people who lack imagination and talent themselves because a person has to have some talent and imagination to recognize it in others. Its amazing that I was able to sit and watch a movie for 2 1/2 hours without getting distracted or bored even once especially considering that there is not a shred of special effects in this movie to dazzle me. Are there some flaws in the front-and-center kidnapping storyline? Sure. A few. But the movie is so good at everything else going on inside of it that it doesnt matter. Reply October 8 2013  by  Jake West     Coming from Farty that sounds hilarious. Reply September 23 2013  by  Mike     One of the best movies of the year? Oh nonsense. One of the worst bits of over-wrought garbage Ive seen in several years. Hugh Jackman doesnt act. He furrows. Christie I dont mean to argue but the Keller Dover character does not ""begin to hate himself"" for his monstrous inexcusable (except were supposed to excuse since we live in times of Colin-Powell expedience when were all so helplessly and stupidly afraid of each other we need ""good"" torturers to ""save"" us from all the bad torturers) actions. Nor does he begin to drink heavily again. All of that is faking to hide his vigilante activities from incompetent law enforcement. This is bad heavy-as-a-ton-handed writing using pop paranoia to distract audiences from all the plot-holes big enough to crack an axle on. Worst movie this year more accurately. And this year has had OZ and MAN OF STEEL in it. Reply September 23 2013  by  Russell Dee     What a joke Worst movie of the year - what a laugh In case you hadnt noticed Rotten Tomatoes is currently reporting that among the viewers who have seen this movie 90% agree with me and disagree with you. How does it feel to be in the bottom 10% of the class. Its a good sign that someone lacks talent himself if he cant discern great art when it stares him in the face. This is a great movie. The last time I sat for 2 1/2 hours at a movie theater without losing interest even once is when The Avengers came to the screen. Prisoners is that gripping and it doesnt have any special effects or CGI. Great movie Reply October 10 2013  by  Eric Celeste     I enjoy being in the 10 percent unless Im at a witch-burning. Then Im all KILL THE WITCH Reply September 29 2013  by  garlynne     I agree with you. This movie is propaganda driven vitriol that tries to situate villainy in religion handicapped people the elderly and a priest. Its sick. Reply November 16 2013  by  peter solari     Mike you are right on correct I saw it last night and agree with you. Reply September 23 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Mike good catch on the drinking thanks for that. But I do think he hates himself eventually -- he says something along the lines of ""Why are you making me do this to you?"" Or rather he screams it. He prays toward the end the way he did at the beginning and finds he cant get through it. Reply September 23 2013  by  Russell Dee     I also realized that the drinking was just to supply him cover for what he was doing in the building. Reply September 23 2013  by  Nicholas     Christy As a huge fan of your reviews I do agree with most of your points. Especially with the amazing Cinematography. I felt like they teased us with some great set ups to flesh out these characters more (Lokis Blinking and Twitching. Jackmans Basement of goodies etc) But they just kind of didnt go anywhere with them. Why do this to not only add mystery but to ultimately piss off a viewer as well looking for more with the majority of the characters in this film? Keep up the great work on WhatTheFlick Nick Reply September 23 2013  by  Russell Dee     In my above post I mean to say that they gave Loki a tick and some weird tattoos to emphasize the point that Lokie had a personality/life prior to this movie and and they filled Jackmans garage with survivalist paraphernalia for the same reason PLUS to let us know that Jackmans character is something of a rigid person. For example given Jackmans religiosity singing the national anthem in the shower and survivalist paraphernalia dont you conclude that hes a republican and kind of extreme? And then that makes you wonder how he has an African American family for best friends and why Bruce Springsteen is one of his favorite singers like republican Chis Christie. There are Interesting paradoxes going on in this splendid movie. Reply September 24 2013  by  JozieLee     Russell you have me positvely curious about the Jackman character. A Republican? Wouldnt any parent regardless of their political affiliation go psycho when their kid is missing? So I wonder why that comes to mind for u. Youve got me so curious Ill prob see it this weekend. If I hate it youll hear from me. If I like it imma have to thank you for speaking up for your fav flick. Totally enjoying ur posts. Keep em comin Reply September 29 2013  by  Russell Dee     I admit that the front-and-center storyline has some flaws but they dont matter. You notice the flaws and then swoosh them away because the movie is so well done otherwise and the flaws arent so big as to destoy the movie. They wrap it up too quickly and kind of messilyand there are a few other things that bugged me a little bit but the movie is still thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. I really liked the performance by the suspect (Dano). I went to see Riddick (another new movie) the other day and I had to wait about 30 minutes for it to start so I sat in on the Prisoners showing for those 30 minutes and I really did not want to leave even. If I had already seen Riddick I would have stayed to see Prisoners again instead. Im going to pay to see Prisoners again this Tuesday when I just have to pay 5. Prisoners is a fine movie and I predict it will get some Oscars. I really like the scene where the suspect (Dano) is driving his motorhome and he runs it into a tree and then they show him starting straight-ahead at the cops/camera and he looks so eerie and creepie bathed in moonlight and rain and the expression on his face. Reply September 29 2013  by  Russell Dee     When I see a movie I guess I try to identify and empathize with the characters. Jackman turns into a vigilante and as part of identifying/empathizing with him (and his actions) I was noticing the differences between he and I along with the similarities between he and I. Jackmans character is rigid hes heavy into hunting possesses intense religiosity sings the national anthem in the shower talks kind of tea-party and exhibits survivalist behavior. These things are kind of right-wing extreme and Im a democrat. On the other hand there are scenes when he comes off as caring and sensitive. And his cause is understandable because he heard the suspect say something (in the parking lot after the suspect was released by the cops for lack of evidence) that nobody else heard the suspect say the suspect really did say it and what he said seems to indicate that the suspect was involved with the kidnapping. So Jackman had this piece of evidence that nobody else had - a statement by the suspect. Like I said I was trying to identify/empathize with the character (Jackmans) and the movie gave me plenty of reasons to write him off as a dangerous vgilante thug but then theres his intermittent sensitivity/caring love for Bruce Springsteen the rightness of his cause the fact that he had a piece of evidence that nobody else had - that statement made by the suspect which the suspect really did say. It was not a misunderstanding. I found myself being annoyed with Jackman but also pulling for him. And in the end I would make the case that he was not only right but also that if he had not done the things he did then one of the girls - his girl - would have died. The way the timing of things played out Jackmans daughter lived because of the things Jackman did. Reply September 29 2013  by  Russell Dee     Oh yea and another thing about the character Jackman portrayed is that his closest friends are African American and this is one of the things that goes against the grain of some of his rigid and extreme ideas. Hes a complicated character. And by way of those complications its possible to identify with him (somewhat) and empathize with him especially since he had that one piece of evidence that i talked about where the released suspect said something incriminating to him. He still felt kind of dirty to me because he takes things pretty far but his complicated character gives you room to feel for him no matter which side of the political aisle you reside in. He was just trying to save his daughter (and he probably did) something of a schmuck though he may be. Reply October 2 2013  by  David     Dont you think it is a bit racist to suggest it is ""strange"" for a white man that is Christian patriotic and survivalist to be friends with a black family? (Not all black people are American) It seems you are buying into a stereotype that white men are racist. Reply October 4 2013  by  Russell Dee     No I dont think its racist for me to suggest that Jackmans Character who is something of a tea-party republican survivalist whacko is perplexing because hes also best friends with an African American family among some other issues. Everyone knows that the tea-party is accused of racism towards African Americans so it seems interesting/perplexing to me that Jackmans tea-party charactermwould be best friends with an African American family. This having been said I wont respond to any other issues regarding racial politics. I know I first raised the issue but I was just making comments about the perplexing nature of one of the characters in the movie. I dont want to get into a back-and-forth about politics and race here because this is a movie site so lets be mindful and respectful of that. BTW I still think Jackman Loki the black wife and the suspect all deserve Oscar noms and some of those people should get Oscars but I just saw ""Gravity"" and I think that Sandra Bullock is going to be very hard to beat for best female actress. She is really something special and Gravity is a heck of a movie. Wow You should all see ""Gravity"" because its really good. There are some parts that are a little over the top and hard to swallow but it wont prevent you from thoroughly enjoying the movie. As much as I like Prisoners I have to say that I like ""Gravity"" better. Chris what do you think of Gravity? I saw it on a new giant screen Cinetopia in the Pacific Northwest and it was really something special. This thing is a serious contender or the Oscar too. Reply September 23 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Thank you for the kind words Nick As the mother of a Nicolas myself I assume you must be a gentleman of taste and distinction (with frequent bursts of good-natured insanity). What WAS up with the blinking and twitching anyway? Reply September 26 2013  by  Justin     I think the whole thing about the twitching Christy was that Loki (whats up with that name?) does that whenever hes anxious or excited. And that for me made him a more interesting character Why does he twitch like that? What do the tattoos? I think we were made to think about him somewhat. Which is fine for me but not everyone else. I do think the film is a lot better than you give credit for. Ill be damned if I dont hear of any Oscar nominations for either Jackman or Gyllenhaal. And you were spot-on about the cinematographers work. I agree the plot can be weak and heavy-handed in some areas. And there are some elements that dont get fleshed out very well (i.e. the religion aspects). And Dovers transformation happens a little too quickly in my opinion. Regardless I think I understand how youve come to your conclusions and I respect you for it. You certainly gave a better negative review than the last guy I read. Reply September 26 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Thank you for your thoughtful response Justin Reply September 23 2013  by  Douglas Roy     Although I know your take about this taunt and engrossing film (in my opinion) I still wouldve liked to have seen and heard both your comments and that of your WHAT THE FLICK? compatriots Ben and Alonso et al. Any possibility that youll do a video review of this film as well? Reply September 23 2013  by  Gary     Saw the film yesterday and believe you me Christy is spot on The film ebbs and flowsbut still worth your time. Reply September 23 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Hey Douglas thanks for asking. Well review ""Prisoners"" as well as ""Rush"" and ""Enough Said"" this week. We couldnt tape any new reviews last week because they were busy moving the Young Turks studio. So well play some catch-up along with the new stuff. Reply September 24 2013  by  Andrew Drewes     Christy you make excellent points as always. And you are right ""Prisoners"" is basically a standard kidnapping picture with Big Meaning grafted between each ridiculous plot point. That explains why it is indeed overlong. Im sure youll agree that underneath all of the cheap thrills and grafted on symbolism its rather despicable. The film tries to rile us up when the mystery is rather obvious from the get go. It wants to awaken our own prejudices and make us feel anger towards Paul Dano specifically and I for one could not go along with it. Watching two bigots trek deep into the rabbit hole proved for a very exhausting two and a half hours. There just isnt much motivation behind all this technical mastery. On the plus side this movie is further proof that Maria Bello can do a lot with very little. Thanks again for your unfiltered take -Andrew Reply September 24 2013  by  Russell Dee     The front-and-center storyline about the 2 girls being kidnapped is a typical kidnap story. Its been done a zillion times but this movie is different from ALL of the other kidnap movies because the director made his kidnap movie so brilliantly artistic the scriptwriter for this movie gave it nifty diaglogue the two leading actors and the black wife all gave Oscar-worthy performance and the cinematography is great too. This movie has nifty twists and turns and I liked the end where you are left hanging whether or not Jackman was rescued or not. With all the great artistic technique applied by all of the people involved this movie stands out from all of the other kidnap movies out there and the end result is anything but typical or common. Reply September 24 2013  by  David     Review is spot on. Prisoners is a 2 1/2 hour movie that would have been pretty good if it was an 1 hour 55 minutes. Script is not smart or thought provoking just repetitive amp; quite boring. The second suspect in the movie turns out to be present only to mislead you of the actual ""twist"". In hindsight this character makes very little sense despite a weak attempt to make some sense of his actions. The only positive part of the second suspect is it gives you hope of something actually developing in the storyline. Reply September 24 2013  by  Russell Dee     Oh yea and the guy who played the mentally challenged young suspect was also great. he was indispensable. He was perfect. There were 4 acting performances that were Oscar-worthy (Jackaman Lokie the black wife and the young suspect) in this one movie and yet some people want to complain about the movie. What a laugh Reply September 24 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Russell it appears that you have some interest in this film. Reply September 29 2013  by  Russell Dee     Christie I dont have any interest in the movie other than that I like it. None. I think this movie is very VERY good. Yes I think it has flaws but I also thought ""No Country For Old Men"" has flaws but I still like it. You might ask what the flaws were in ""NO Country..."" and I would say that the end when Josh Brolin got killed that confrontation wasnt shown I didnt like it when Brolin threw up (I always hate that and I wish directors would stop showing that)  Brolins wife was at times wise and at other times as unwise as a newborn baby since Brolins wife knew Chagur would be looking for her why did she go to a house where he could easily find her and why didnt she try to run and then what happened to the money? There were a few other things about the movie that bothered me but there were many good things about it. Ultimately I go to movies to be entertained and if a movie can keep me entertained then thats a good thing. Prisoners kept me entertained and fully engrossed for 2 1/2 hours despite there being no special effects of any kind. That says a lot. The movie is entertaining. Im confident that very few of (the few) people who are ragging on it fell asleep during Prisoners. Reply September 25 2013  by  John K     Good review. I thought the movie was good in some respects but uneven. A decent mystery story which does lead somewhere and with clues which do make sense in light of later events. But the acting alternates between semi-catatonic and hysterical and you never know when the next Jackman explosion will come which I suppose is a sort of suspense. But the director would do better with a shortened running time. Reply September 26 2013  by  Ron     I saw the movie opening night 1050 PM. And I still had to drive 45 mins to get home. Long movie. But I really enjoyed it. You know foriegn directors carrry a bit of the foriegn film feel with them into crossover movies like this. Many years ago I used to work second shift and watched all night movies back in the 70s and 80s. I got to see a lot of foriegn films. They always end with something left. FINI. I was not blown away by Jackman even though I have just begun to like his work. I thought he was really good in Les Mes. Prior to the kidnapping I thought he was a bit too edgy for Thanksgiving Day. I did feel like the two families did not quite fit as friends. Not for Thanksgiving Day. Maybe we needed some other family member connection to make that work. Couple of Grandfathers that knew each other in the war or something. And I think the lack of connection in the two families kind of stayed wrong. Other than that I really enjoyed the movie. I recognize Dano and Gyllenhaal have played these parts before. But Gyllenhaal was really good. He was the movie for me. His questioning of Dano his reaction to Jackman going off on him were just plan perfect acting I thought. And I think I enjoyed it better watching it with him as the lead instead of Jackman. Reply September 27 2013  by  Danusha Goska     Thank you for exposing this piece of crap film. Yes yes yes. It is trying so hard to be about something when it fact it is idiotic and implausible. It pretends to be about something in order to sell tickets. It keeps the viewer watching with sadism and gore. Reply September 29 2013  by  Russell Dee     so you kept watching right? Isnt that the point to a movie - to captivate the audience? And didnt the movie do that to you? Reply September 27 2013  by  Robert     RobertVaughn 3 minutes ago The film is decent as entertainment goes on both a technical and storyline level. Its dark mostly depressing but with a certain element that makes it worthwhile in the end for the questions it asks and the dilemmas it explores. Its not Saw or torture porn anyway. There is an exploration of faith and loss of faith as well as the frailty and limitations of the human psyche. Human complexity and the varying coping mechanisms we cling to when confronted with nightmare circumstances. As a mystery film it works to a degree. There was something about the film that made me think Kafka (The Trial consider the whistle in the final scene) and Eichman in Jerusalem. The bewildering indifferent universe with only glimmers of some kind of revelation and the banality of good and evil and what that means. And yes Jozie Jackmans character would almost certainly be characterized as Republican or possibly socially conservative blue collar Democrat (famously derided by the president as a ""clinger to guns and religion""). Reply September 28 2013  by  john hofbauer     Ugh what a bad film after the first 30 minutes. This review is spot on.

I sooo agree with this film review I KNEW I should never go to a movie over 2 1/2 hours long unless it was made by David Lean (who is alas dead). Halfway through this overwrought piece of pretentiousness I found myself yearning for a director of the caliber of Hitchcock (also alas dead) who could have told this story in an hour and half with far less overt violence and chocolate syrup (whats with all the brown blood?) and general YUK .... AND horrified us far more effectively. After an hour and a half I also couldnt stand for another minute watching Jake Gyanhaall twitch his eyes (to make sure we knew that his character was supposed to be ""edgy"") so finally I stopped looking at his face altogether. The only thing about this movie that was any good really was seeing the wonderful character actor Lou Cariou (as the priest) come out of retirement. Why this movie had to be so stupendously BAD is beyond me when there was plenty of talent (though talent seemed eschewed in favor of scenery-chewing behavior with the exception of Melissa Leo). Reply October 21 2013  by  Ron     Jackie...90 percent of the viewers of this filmed loved it including myself. You and your 10 percent are appalled at the realism of the film which is what real life is all about. Sometimes violence is put into a film just for the sake of it...but this film portrayed the violence as needed for story developement. And Jakes performance (twitching and all) was magnifcent. Now go back to watching your Lifetime channel. Reply October 2 2013  by  Russell Dee     I just saw Prisoners again and now that Ive seen it for the 2nd time I can say that its even better than I thought it was after seeing it the first time. The first time I saw it it seemed like there were a couple parts that were disjointed because in the early part of the movie theres the part where there is a drunk priest who has a corpse in his house and that whole storyline seemed unrelated to everything else just like the storyline where the cops brought in the disturbed guy who played with mannequins bought little girls clothes and had snakes in suitcases in his house. That is the guy who killed himself (shot a gun into his mouth) at the police station. Firstly the corpse at the drunk priests house is the runaway husband of the female killer who is Alexs (Danos) so called aunt. Secondly the guy who killed himself at the police station (the guy with the snakes manequins and little girls clothes) is one of the kids that the female killer (Alexs aunt) kidnapped years earlier when he was a child. He was doing all that weird stuff (mannequins kids clothes snakes mazes) because that is what he learnt from the bad guy who ran away from Alexs aunt and ended up a corpse at the priests house. Thirdly when Alex pulled his motorhome into the tree and he looked so creepy outside of the motorhome it wasnt moonlight on his face. It was rain and the light from the cops flashlights. Man thats a very effective scene because its intended to creep out the viewer and it sure does. Nifty movie. To the movies detractors I woudl say that roughly 90% of the general public likes this movie roughly 80 percent of the critics like this movie and 2/3 of the top critics like this movie. This is a very good movie and it will win Oscars. Reply October 6 2013  by  chino     Just saw this movie tonight and I agree 100% with the reviewer I always look at at the reviews on rotten tomatoes to ensure Im not wasting my time watching bad movies. After seeing all the positive reviews I thought I would like this movie. Wrong Overly complicated plot red herrings galore tidy ending Gyllenhaals constant eye twitching this movie was an overly pretentious pile of manure. What was the aunts motivation for what she did? How did Hughs character know to go back to her? What a coincidence that Loki found the body in the basement that ties everything together The many plotholes and contrived coincidences totally ruined this movie. Reply October 6 2013  by  Sam     Chino All of the questions you asked are answered. What was the aunts motivation for what she did? She was super religious and used to ride around the country in that RV with her husband and child spreading the ""word of god"". When her son died from cancer she stopped believing. She said she felt she needed to take children away from families to show them God doesnt exist and to ruin their lives in the same was hers was ruined. She explained this when Jackman came to her home at the end. How did Hughs character know to go back to her? In the hospital Jackmans daughters friend told Jackman ""You were there so they put duct tape on our mouths"". If you recall Jackman had previously visited the aunt that morning and the Aunt therefore covered the girls mouths and hid them. Jackman clearly realized it was the Aunt at that moment in the hospital. What a coincidence that Loki found the body in the basement that ties everything together? This was not a coincidence. In a kidnapping case with no suspects police officers visit convicted child predators in the surrounding area. Jake Gyllenhall explained thats why he was knocking on doors before visiting the priests home. Therefore either the priest was on that list or Gylenhall had a previous connection to the priest from his past mysterious life. Also it was said that Loki had never left a case unsolved....clearly good at his job Of course he would find evidence that the average detective would struggle to discover. You said ""The many plotholes and contrived coincidences totally ruined this movie"" I think you just did not pay attention. Reply October 21 2013  by  Ron     You are in a huge minority...this film was one of the best of the decade. Just because you are not smart enough to follow the plot does not mean a movie is not any good. Reply October 8 2013  by  Jake West     Because I didnt know much about the movie I feel as though I got duped into watching a form of torture porn. How far would you go to save your child? Ummm not as far as the picture showed and I would chose some other person involved or you could try drugs first before torture. I got sick and found their were little heroes in this sick picture. I cant comment more as it will give away to many details. Im not a liberal Marxist but I would never harm the person-character like that. Once you chose 3rd world tactics you are no longer human yourself. Is humanity to become a monster in order to save mankind? I hope not. My main beef is the person the ""hero"" chose to ""question"" Yes you can still drive a vehicle and be considered mentally handicapped. Reply October 8 2013  by  Russell Dee     Jake you have a point but in this movie I think that if Jackmans character had not done the things he did his daughter would have died. The things he did resulted in things happening that got Loki to go to Alexs aunts house and stop her from killing Jackmans daughter. I decided that Loki rescued Jackmans character and Im sure that Jackmans characters attorney will point out to the judge that the things Jackman did led to Jackmans daughter being saved and the killer being stopped and Jackmans character will end up with only a slap in the wrist. Reply October 21 2013  by  Ron     Hard to say what you would really do because it did not happen to you. It is also easy to say the that torture is an extreme when a child of yours has never been kidnapped or murdered. Torture SHOULD be done to any person harming a child in any way. In this country the criminal have all the rights and the victims have none...I know from experience. Reply October 18 2013  by  Joel Bentry     This was not the worst movie of the year but it certainly is overrated. On plot the spooky femaile villian sitting in the background over the obvious suspect with the RV is a bit to simplistic. Having someone being so bull headed as torturing a disabled person is way over the believable line. A real Jackmans character would not be so dumb as to skip right to the beating he would have considered phrases uttered by the cognitively disabled Alex and would have considered the option that Alex was repeating what he heard not what he did-- especially after his torture didnt yield anything more. The semi-comatose Maria Bello character was a bit much -- real mothers are stronger than that. Etc etc. Ill give the actors some points for selling it but as others have noted the characters were a bit to simple for my tastes. And the ending when Hugh J. faces off and the villain holds a gun on him ... to think that such a survivalist and physical person wouldnt have made a move right then -- do you think someone like that would the sedative? Oh come on. As soon as Hugh knew the identity for sure of the horrible insane and multiple-count killer his survival instincts would tell him his best chance was at the beginning ... throw a tool stumble and clip the gun from the hand that held it throw the bottle of sedative at the gun etc... ... he would have gone down with a fight. he wasnt going to find out where his daughter was from this psycho and his defensive position would only get worse ... which it did. So this movie could have been better overall. I was getting tired watching it in the theatre but it did hold my interest.... so Id give it two stars out of four as well. Reply October 19 2013  by  Mo     Thanks for writing a sane review. This movie was pure shite in my opinion truly awful and I agree with the person above who felt it to be the worst movie this year. It may be among the worst movies I have ever seen. All the slobbering over it by the ""90 %"" is proof to me that we now live in the times depicted in a much better film than this IDIOCRACY. That anyone would consider this film Oscar worthy is stunning and not in a good way. Reply October 21 2013  by  Ron     Have fun at the new Transformers movie that is coming out next year...that is more your speed. Reply January 26 2014  by  Dawn     Ron is it always your default position to attack someones intellect if they do not agree with your opinion? The priests involvement doesnt make much sense. Lets assume that he is in fact a defrocked priest who has a history of predation on children. I can go with that I can accept that Loki would do what any cop would do and go straight to the known offenders within a certain area. What doesnt make sense is how the script attempts to force a connection to the priest that doesnt seem to have a basis in logic. How did the priest and the dead man come in contact with each other? Was there some sort of Deviants Club where there are monthly meetings? The priest said he came to him for confession. He doesnt know the dead mans name. How does the dead man know that the Father is a priest? The aunt told a back story of the family driving around in the camper van handing out flyers for Jesus. This would be amazingly uncharacteristic for a Catholic family. Why would priest kill and hide the dead man after his confession? The sanctity of Confession is an immovable foundation of the faith and the vows of a priest. So if we accept that somehow these two characters met each other and the dead man was overwrought with grief for his past AND confessed this to the priest and the priest killed him out of revenge or out of some frustrated desire to keep him from harming more children. Why did his vow to keep the secrets of this man who confessed to him keep him from going to the police all those years ago when he confessed but not after he was found in possession of the corpse? The second guy Mr. Parkour who sneaks into the houses of both sets of parents he was taking items of the girls clothing. He clearly didnt live with the aunt he was supposed to be another victim of the kidnappers. He knows who the kidnappers are he knows who the victims are he was play acting being the kidnapper. Why was this ""other victim"" allowed to escape? Why was he living independently from the aunt? What did I miss here? Was crazy mazey snake guy just some sort of ninja detective that had inside information about the couple who kidnapped 16 kids but never revealed it to anyone? Too many illogical leaps of faith to allow me to suspend my disbelief that much. Reply February 21 2014  by  Russell Dee     Dawn the priest storyline was relevant because the guy found dead in the basement at the Priests home was the former husband of the female killer - Alexs supposed aunt. Her man ran away and went to the priests house and partially confessed to the priest. This became apparent at the end of the movie when Detective Loki got to the female Alexs aunts home and saw the picture of her ex-husband on the counter-top and her ex-husband in that picture was wearing the same maze necklace that the corpse in the priests basement was wearing. Detective Loki shrugged knowingly when he saw the picture on the counter-top because he realized at that moment that Alexs Aunts ex-husband was the corpse in the priests basement. It all tied together. My final thoughts are that prisoner was the best movie of the year. I liked Gravity but after more thought I decided that I liked the visuals in gravity rather than the storyline character-development or dialogue. The general story of Gravity was solid but parts of the storyline were ridiculous. For example when she was using a fire extinguisher to putt around in space and when she aimed her Russian space pod so well that she nearly landed on the Chinese satellite only to arrive at the exact moment the Chinese satellite was about to crash to earth. Ridiculous At the risk of sounding politically incorrect I that a lesser movie will likely win Best movie for politically correct reasons. I think a race-based movie will win Best movie even though it isnt as good as Prisoners Captain Phillips or American Hustle. Reply December 1 2013  by  Russell Dee     LOL So let me get this straight - youre in the bottom 10% of the class and youre badmouthing the students in the upper 10-percent of the class. Alright Whatever you say. I mean if it makes you feel better to cut down the top 90% of the class while you are sitting in the bottom 10% of the class thats fine with me. Reply October 29 2013  by  Beks     Agree with this review completely. I thought it was about half a decent movie but by the time it was all wrapping together in a neat little bow I was rolling my eyes very hard. The worst part was hearing the killer explain their motives like a Bond movie villain. Melissa Leo and Viola Davis in particular were wasted in this film. Lastly Im disgusted by commenters who seem to think that it was okay for Hugh Jackmans character to torture an intellectually disabled man. I really hope we werent supposed to think that - if so then the movie is even worse than I thought. Reply December 1 2013  by  Russell Dee     Beks Love of ones child is very powerful. If a father is on trial for injuring a certainly-guilty person who kidnapped the fathers daughter I would want to find the father not-guilty if the defense attorney proved that the injured person really was involved in the kidnapping and the fathers actions is what saved his child from certain death especially if the father had evidence no one else had as was true in this movie. The fact that the suspect was intellectually disabled was relevant to me but there were things that were perhaps more relevant to me. Tell me was the total innocence and helplessness of the two little girls relevant to you at all? The disabled person had information that he wasnt sharing. If it were real life would it be best for the two innocent helpless little girls to die? Is that the preferable outcome in these kinds of situations? As Ive said before if Jackmans character doesnt do the things he did then his innocent little girl would have died. So if you are saying that Jackman shouldnt have done the things he did then you are saying that at least one of those innocent helpless little girls should have died. Im sorry but I disagree with you. Reply January 2 2014  by  Kathy     Russell so totally agree with everything youve said here. And hopefully no one else will read this bc Im not going to go back and forth...but I wanted to beat the character ""Alex"" myself. I realize he had something wrong with him (not mentally challenged it was from a lifetime of being subjected to the torture and murder of kids). However a parent who loves their children with the amount of love I feel would lose their mind if this happened. You would do anything ANYTHING to save them. Jackmans character was told ""they didnt cry until I left them"" from that weirdo. He knew something. He wasnt mentally retarded mentally challenged no Downs Syndrome etc...He was a victim yes. I wonder though how many serials killers had quite disturbing abusive childhoods? Should we give them a free pass too? Anyway it was a great movie. Ppl try to psychoanalyze everything and tear it to shreds. I guess it makes them feel superior. I just watch movies to be entertained  Reply January 11 2014  by  mike     just watched prisoners. it sucked. most stuff wouldnt have happened in real life. had to suspend reality more than once. the ending really sucked. how long after the cop rushed the girl to the hospital were they searching the frozen ground? was the father blowing the whistle or was it a ghost whistle the cop was hearing? whats the point?

But such clarity is elusive here and compelling cases can be made for both.Related Story The Family Unsuitable for All Ages Villeneuves somber thriller opens with the disappearance of two young girls on a bleak chilly Thanksgiving Day in small-town Pennsylvania. Post-turkey-dinner the girls venture out of the house alone and they dont return. Their respective parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) search for them with escalating alarm but it is clear--both from the creepy camper that had been parked on street and from the menacing vibrato of the soundtrack--that Something Horrible Has Happened.The driver of the camper turns out to be a young man (Paul Dano) with the cognitive capacity of a 10-year-old and the detective in charge of the investigation (Jake Gyllenhaal) quickly rules him out as a suspect. But the father of one of the girls Keller Dover (Jackman) is convinced that the boy knows something and he decides to take matters into his own hands with ever-grimmer consequences. The film that unfolds from these premises can easily be viewed through either of the two aforementioned lenses. On the one hand Prisoners is an extremely well-wrought production boasting a strong cast (also featuring Melissa Leo) and pushing the moral questions it raises--about vengeance and vigilantism guilt and innocence the line between victim and perpetrator--well beyond the comfort zone of the typical Hollywood product. Villeneuve who directed the fascinating 2010 film Incendies plays with echoes of many of the better crime films of the past two decades including The Vanishing Mystic River Gone Baby Gone and most notably David Finchers multiple contributions to the genre. Indeed the dark sleety vision conjured by Villeneuve seems almost to occupy the midpoint of a line drawn between Finchers Se7en and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. For those inclined toward a generous view Prisoners is a superior thriller vivid unexpected and unsettling.One could make the case I suppose that the films early artistry and sense of moral consequence simply promise more than the strictures of genre ultimately allow it to provide.And yet ...For all the films craftsmanship its hard to shake the sense that there is a fundamental mismatch between the genuine horrors that open the film (the missing children the anguished parents) and the more conventionally cinematic ones that close it. (Though Villeneuve tinkers--often cleverly--with the tropes of the serial killer genre he does not relinquish them.) One could make the case I suppose that the films early artistry and sense of moral consequence simply promise more than the strictures of genre ultimately allow it to provide. Other flaws are evident as well--a religious subtext that is never adequately developed a red herring the size of a blue whale etc.--though they are minor by comparison.So which is it ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end I come down reservedly on the former side The work done here by Jackman Gyllenhaal (whose performance builds slowly but strikingly) and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore. In spite of the mixed responses it may elicit Prisoners is a film that merits seeing one that announces the arrival of a significant directorial talent.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

At area theaters. On a drizzly Thanksgiving Day in Pittsburgh two little girls are snatched from outside their homes. From the moment of their disappearance ""Prisoners"" takes us on a gripping and provocative journey plunging us into emotional fury swerving toward moral dilemmas teasing us with conviction and tormenting us with uncertainty. Hugh Jackman is a force to be reckoned with as Keller Dover father to 6-year-old Anne. Maria Bello plays wife Grace. We first meet the bearded Keller helping teen son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) line up a shot in the woods. On their ride home Keller a survivalist waxes fatherly on the importance of being ready. Later theyll present deer meat to friends Franklin and Nancy Birch played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. Its their youngest Joy who also goes missing. Being prepared proves to be admirable but also arrogant in a world that occasionally metes out unfathomable evil. All signs point to the inhabitant of a beat-up RV as their abductor. But this is not a chase thriller. The suspect Alex Jones is quickly apprehended by the police led by lone-wolf highly effective Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). But with no evidence of the girls the police must free Jones although everything about him makes Keller certain of his guilt. With his pale moon face Paul Dano can pull off sensitive or suspicious. Here his portrayal of the mentally delayed Jones cant be called sympathetic exactly. Melissa Leo plays his protective aunt Holly. ""Prisoners"" is the whetted work of director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski. In 2011 the French Canadian directors drama about the terrible legacy of sectarian war on the immigrant children of a mother who had left the war-torn Middle East ""Incendies"" was a best-foreign-language Oscar nominee. It was robbed. On the face of things this star-driven English-language endeavor might seem like one of those bad leaps good directors feel forced to make. Not on your life it turns out. ""Prisoners"" is unforgettably relentless in asking moviegoers if Keller has gone too far. And by extension asking us how far we would go. Will there be redemption retribution? ""Prisoners"" asks again and again and brilliantly withholds those answers until the very end.

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The big problem I have with most violent movies is not the violence itself but the failure to show the consequences of that violence. Whatever else might be wrong with it this charge certainly cannot be leveled at ""Prisoners"" which is all about the consequences of violence.On an overcast Thanksgiving in rural Pennsylvania two neighboring families are having a cozy get-together. Among them are Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) a carpenter with a strong survivalist streak; his wife Grace (Maria Bello); and their 6-year-old daughter Anna; they are being hosted by Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and their 7-year-old daughter Joy.At dessert time both girls who had been playing outside are suddenly nowhere to be found. The panic-stricken parents reach out to the local police headed by lead investigator Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). The only clue a mysterious camper that had been parked nearby where the girls were playing. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski set the stage for a whodunit but their ambitions are higher. The doomy dread shot in lustrous monochrome by Roger Deakins coupled with the films Christian fundamentalist undercurrents speak to something more implacable - a free-floating unease that wont necessarily be dispelled when the mystery is solved (if it ever is). The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide On a purely technical level and in terms of what he accomplishes with the actors Villeneuve (a Canadian who was acclaimed for the Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"") does a lot of things right. He keeps the tension level high without turning everything into ""CSI The Boonies."" But the patchy red herring-strewn script is at war with the sophisticated visuals and performances.The screenplay also fragments the dramatic point of view so that at times we are viewing the action from Lokis perspective other times Kellers and so on. The idea I suppose is to present a multifaceted perspective on the horror but the effect is often needlessly wrenching (and negligent the Birches are relegated to also-rans). Lokis story at least to me is the most compelling and thats because unlike Kellers very little is spelled out for us. Gyllenhaal gives a stealthy emotionally complicated performance unlike any hes ever before attempted (including in ""Zodiac""). As in the best noirish detective tradition we can see that Lokis success as an investigator is largely due to his intimate psychological connection with the criminal mind.But the crux of the films philosophical seriousness such as it is lies with Keller. Distrusting the police as precious hours tick by he corrals the chief suspect a half-witted boy (Paul Dano) who lives with his aunt (Melissa Leo) and takes matters into his own hands. The film asks the question How far would you go to protect a loved one?The torture scenes in ""Prisoners"" reminded me of nothing so much as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and thats probably not entirely accidental. By taking torture out of the political realm and into the family homestead Villeneuve wants us to know that there are no havens anymore. The crazies are everywhere.The films attempt to set up a pastoral refuge only to despoil it is fairly rudimentary stuff. Who really believes that crazies only congregate in the cities? Villeneuve takes the films title all too literally He wants to demonstrate how everybody is held captive by their own demons. Keller is only the most flagrant example.Too flagrant. From the beginning hes set up as an extreme take-charge type who is girding his family for an oncoming apocalypse. In ""In the Bedroom"" a much superior film about a decent law-abiding man who takes revenge on his sons killer the horror was in seeing how a good man could be twisted into a savagery beyond his own comprehension. In ""Prisoners"" Keller doesnt have that far to travel from the man we first see to the man he becomes. Hes the centerpiece of a film that for all its pretensions and intermittent power is essentially high-grade claptrap. Grade B- (Rated R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout.)

PICTURES By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF PrisonersStarring Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Viola Davis Maria Bello Paul Dano Melissa Leo Directed by Denis Villeneuve Rated R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout Running time 2 hours 33 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThis vicious melodrama with delusions of profundity imprisons its actors in painfully limited characters. Grade C ""Prisoners"" is an overblown missing-children mystery that wants to comment on the dysfunctional soul of America. The plot is ultra simple. Two young girls are snatched off a quiet suburban street. The only immediate suspect is the driver of a beat-up RV seen in the area before the crime. This nearly mute figure played like a blank puzzle by Paul Dano turns out to have ""the intelligence of a 10-year-old."" When the detective in charge of the case (Jake Gyllenhaal) cant find enough evidence to hold him one girls father (Hugh Jackman) a survivalist with the motto ""Be Ready"" (and the films protagonist) decides to grab this stunted man and torture him into talking. Will the cop crack the case before the girls die - or before the vigilante dad commits murder? Denis Villeneuves filmmaking is so studied and Aaron Guzikowskis script so full of pretensions you may not care. The movie starts with the father saying the Lords Prayer as he guides his son through his first deer hunt. The venison is for the Thanksgiving dinner theyre having at the home of their close neighbors (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The kidnapper snatches the two families little girls while Howards genial host plays ""The Star Spangled Banner"" on his trumpet because the antiheros wife (Maria Bello) says its his favorite song. To Villeneuve the movie is about ""our lives today our relationships with our institutions and whether or not we trust them."" Unfortunately the movie doesnt draw a credible microcosm of society and its characters are not complex enough to serve as our stand-ins. ""Prisoners"" doesnt plumb depths - it merely toys with our sympathies. Who would trust Gyllenhaals prosaic detective? Hes dedicated and commanding but hes too quick to dismiss the advice of Jackmans grief-stricken character just because the man is distraught. And hes not quick at connecting dots - a real drawback when solving a crime that hinges on a maze. Gyllenhaal gives the cop an odd tic - a slow heavy-lidded eye-blink that registers like a mental re-set button. On the other hand its easy to share the frustration of Jackmans self-appointed sentinel of a father. He does hear the suspect say and even sing words that suggest a direct connection to the kidnapping. Theres no reason for viewers not to believe him since we hear them too. As Jackmans bearded patriarch applies increasingly brutal pressure to the callow fellow cringing in his grasp his righteousness becomes monstrous. Too bad the brutality generates only horror not revelation. When this not-so-grand inquisitor keeps blaming his victim for forcing him into cruel inhuman acts his lament comes off as moral window dressing for a bloated sadistic melodrama. Melissa Leo gives a virtuoso stealth performance as the suspects mild-mannered aunt. Except for Davis pulling off an impressive emotional slalom when she visits the makeshift torture chamber all the lead actors do is pour on the anguish and intensity. The hit BBC series ""Broadchurch"" which centers on a child murder takes place in a small town on the Dorset coast of England. But I feel closer to the Brits in ""Broadchurch"" than I do to the Pennsylvanians in ""Prisoners"" - and I grew up right next door to them in New Jersey.

So after the police get nowhere questioning the suspect Decent Guy abducts Creepy Guy to an abandoned house and applies his own enhanced interrogation techniques. Taken + Death Wish + Oldboy = thriller gold. Except that Prisoners which opens this weekend after gracing the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals has a more complex by which I mean simply bigger idea that the virus of righteous revenge can infect the would-be hero as well as the presumed villain and that people can be trapped by the way other people perceive them. Cuz were all prisoners see? (READ Did Oldboy motivate a serial killing?) A family-drama crime thriller Prisoners fits the Oscar-wannabe formula of artistic ambition plus star quality. Five of its leading actors -- Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Terrence Howard Viola Davis and Melissa Leo -- have earned a combined two Academy Awards and seven nominations. Its French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve making his first English-language film snagged a Foreign Film Oscar nomination for Incendies in 2011. The script by Aaron Guzikowski once topped the famous Black List of best unproduced screenplays. The cinematographer is Roger Deakins a 10-time Oscar nominee including work on five Coen brothers movies and most recently for Skyfall. So Prisoners has got more pedigree than a Westminster dog-show winner. Its just not very good. In fact its worse than not-very-good; its couldve-been-really-good-and-isnt. Jackman your favorite Jean Valjean and Wolverine turns from two types of Big Movie to a seemingly small naturalistic one. He plays Keller Dover a contractor living in rural Pennsylvania with his wife Grace (Maria Bello) their teen son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and younger daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). Annas best friend is Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) daughter of the Dovers neighbors Nancy and Franklin (Davis and Howard). (READ How Hugh Jackman sang his pain in Les Miserables) Anna and Joy disappear shortly after Ralph notices a strange van parked on their block. The local cop Loki (Gyllenhaal) apprehends the vans driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a shy possibly disturbed loner. After questioning Alex Loki lets him return to the home of his stern Aunt Holly (Leo). Thats when Keller shifts from ordinary Joe to avenging angel and tries to torture a confession out of Alex. Guzikowskis script pushes familiarly grisly serial-killer tropes in a couple of novel directions; if you anticipate the films ending youre way ahead of us. It smartly tests the viewers sympathies and common sense. And it achieves its art-house bona fides by borrowing from the vengeful-parent motif of the 2001 In the Bedroom. The project might have seemed perfect for David Fincher -- except that Fincher had already made two similar films Se7en and Zodiac. But it did attract Gyllenhaal whose character here inexplicably shares his name with the Norse god who caused so much trouble in Thor and The Avengers and who more or less reprises his Zodiac role a sleuth obsessed with heinous crimes. (READ How David Fincher got it right in Zodiac) So the job went to Villeneuve who swathes rural Georgia (stunt-doubling for Pennsylvania) in rain and murk. Through all the haze you can almost detect the clever comely outline of Guzikowskis script inside the flab and pretension of Villeneuves directorial decisions. The movie which clocks in at nearly two-and-a-half hours is perhaps an hour longer than it ought to be. The needless padding comes from the actors repeating essential lines of dialogue two or three times -- you know like real people do. (But do they? And in a movie should they?) The stars get to vent anger but mainly in cliches  Jackman smashes things; Gyllenhaal trashes his office desk. (READ Incendies as an Oscar nominee for Best Foreign-Language Film) In a nod to the tropes of mainstream movies Prisoners has a climactic chase scene en route to a hospital; apparently Loki is the only cop in Pennsylvania and though grievously wounded he cannot call on reserves to help him. And when the film should be tightening the narrative screws it allows itself grand-opera delusions giving virtually every major character a final verbal aria. Perhaps Villeneuve was paid by the number of minutes in the release print. Among the actors Leo steals scenes with her usual steely resolve. Dano pumps his whiny-disturbed persona (from There Will Be Blood Meeks Cutoff and Looper) to a new register and this time it works. David Dastmalchian is excellent -- chatty modest with some subtle telltale psychopathy -- in a small role as one of the kidnap suspects. And Gyllenhaal does Gyllenhaal; hes good at that. (The African-American actors are given little of import to work with; they are the merest black herrings.) (READ Melissa Leo as an Oscar pick for The Fighter) Jackman tries hard to fit his outside frame into a common-man mold and then into a creature who may be as deranged as any child molester but he is saddled with ludicrous lines -- such as when he whacks Alex and screams ""Why are you making me do this?"" Maybe if he sang it like Jean Valjean... This is one of those films that prod the viewer to dream of storming the editing room and trying to carve an excellent thriller out of a meandering rough cut. Or to paraphrase Winston Churchills definition of golf Prisoners is a good walk in the pathological dark spoiled.

Prisoners Is Quebec director Denis Villeneuves Hollywood debut a serious moral drama or formulaic genre film? Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 20 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 20 2013 914AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Denis Villeneuve Written by Aaron Guzikowski Starring Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2013 Country USA Language English Quebec director Denis Villeneuves English-language debut and first studio movie Prisoners is subtly crafted and compelling but it suffers from a case of split personality.Is it a serious adult moral drama about violence that eventually surrenders to the formula of a genre film? Or is it a flashy serial-killer thriller dressed up with some overworked moral talking points? Although the two are not necessarily exclusive the film you begin watching when the lights dim is not the same one you carry home from the theatre. Multimedia Prisoners The official trailer Video Video Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal praise Denis Villeneuve at TIFF Fans of the now-45-year-old auteur know Villeneuve favours dark fragmentary dramas about trauma and its aftershocks imbued with a sense of almost ceremonial gravity. Over the past 13 years his films have included Maelstrom (hit-and-run attempted suicide) August 32nd on Earth (horrific car crash) and Polytechnique (school massacre). His international breakthrough the Oscar-nominated Incendies adapted from Wajdi Mouawads stage drama and set against the background of a Middle East civil war unearthed a contemporary Greek tragedy behind the drone of television news.So no surprise Prisoners begins with signs and portents. In the rainy Pennsylvania woods a man recites the Lords Prayer before urging his teenaged son to shoot a deer. The man is Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) a bearded handyman with a crucifix hanging in his pickup truck and a basement full of food in case of some future calamity.Though Keller initially seems like a right-wing fundamentalist wing nut the stereotype is soon undermined when the hunters return home. Keller his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their son and daughter are spending Thanksgiving with their African-American best friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two daughters. Shortly after dinner the two youngest girls Anna Dover and Joy Birch go outside to play and dont return apparent victims of an abduction.Suspicion falls on a unfamiliar recreational vehicle spotted on the street. The truck is soon found and the mute terrified driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is arrested. The police discover that Alex has the intellectual capability of a 10-year-old and there is no physical evidence linking him to the missing girls so they release him. But Keller hears Alex whisper something in a scuffle outside the courthouse and is convinced he knows the girls whereabouts. Keller decides to kidnap Alex hold him in an abandoned house and torture the truth out of him.No one is likely to miss echoes of the ""enhanced interrogation"" justifications used by the Bush administration to defend the torture of prisoners. But screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski has upped the ugly ante in the ethical conundrum First would you torture a suspect if it meant saving your child? And second would you torture a suspect who is himself in a sense a child?Amid the trauma of losing a child the Dovers domestic bonds strain Grace dopes herself with pills while Keller takes up the bottle he put down nine years before. The Birch family fades into the background after expressing their repulsion for and unwillingness to stop Kellers scheme.The second more commercial strand of Prisoners is a thriller. Villeneuve and his ace team - including the Coen brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins and Clint Eastwoods editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach - provide the rich visual texture and pace to slide us effortlessly through this slippery dark world past the plot holes and red herrings into a dream world.This part of the movie belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal playing a gaunt loner with a mythological name Detective Loki who has a compulsive blink and a creepy neck tattoo. We first meet him at a Chinese restaurant having Thanksgiving dinner alone and trying to flirt with a waitress when the call comes through about the missing children. Its his characters function to lead us through the grisly puzzle of a serial killers plot. When Alex disappears Loki is not only trying to find the missing girls but the former suspect as well. Keller and Loki meet confront each other and crisscross each others paths as they circle around the mystery.Loki visits Alexs aunt (Melissa Leo in a granny wig and oversized specs) and questions various sex offenders in the area with more creepy discoveries; some are relevant others are just indicative of an apparent pervert epidemic. Attention eventually focuses on a new suspect another loner (David Dastmalchian) who compulsively draws mazes.As Prisoners slides through the labyrinth it feels progressively more hyperbolic even parodying the form of Se7en Silence of the Lambs and their innumerable imitators. Any pretense of naturalism of real-life stakes disappears. Individual sequences jump the heart rate A furtive home invasion and a climactic car race feel as though they should end with someone waking up in a sweaty sheets.Yet the more that Prisoners conforms to the expectations of a well-crafted movie experience the less it seems to be about anything that matters. You may be impressed but youre less likely to be convinced by its resolution.

"Prisoners (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Prisoners (R) Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver powerhouse performances in this gripping but flawed thriller about a child abduction. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/19/2013 Editor rating 2.5 Keller (Hugh Jackman) the protagonist of Prisoners is a hope-for-the-best but prepare-for-the-worst type. In the basement of his home he keeps enough supplies and weapons to survive an apocalypse. Hes a blue-collar hands-on kind of guy but hes also a devoted father and husband and even a spiritual man. When he takes his son out deer hunting for the first time he teaches the boy to quietly recite The Lords Prayer before pulling the trigger. Played by Jackman with great tenderness and heart Keller is a commanding funny person -- the sort youd love to have as a friend but would never want as an enemy. During Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors the Bryces (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) Keller and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) realize their 6-year-old daughter has disappareared along with the Bryces 7-year-old girl. A frantic search of both houses leads nowhere. The only clue was a run-down RV spotted earlier in the day parked on their block which has since vanished. Assigned to the case is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is eating Thanksgiving dinner by himself at a Chinese restaurant when the call comes in. The detective catches a lucky break finding a suspicious RV whose driver immediately tries to escape but crashes instead. Driver Alex (Paul Dano) a peculiar man who sports Jeffrey Dahmer eyeglasses and an inscrutable facial expression is brought in for questioning. But the authorities quickly determine Alex has an IQ of a 10 year-old and after scouring his camper truck for forensic evidence and finding nothing they have no choice but to release him to the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo). But if Alex is innocent why did he try to flee from police when they approached his vehicle? Prisoners marks the Hollywood debut of French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve best known for 2010s Oscar-nominated Incendies. The movie comes on like gangbusters gripping you with its immediacy and speed (if it were a book the screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski would be a maniacal page-turner). Gyllenhaal exuding a kind of street-smart authority he had never played before embodies the detectives dilemma of wanting to rush through leads to find the missing girls but taking the time to carefully follow clues in order to not miss a critical detail. But Keller isnt quite as patient. His grief-stricken wife blames him for not having found their daughter (""You made me feel so safe"" Grace tells him. ""You told me you could protect us from anything."") And Keller is also convinced Alex is putting on an act and knows where his daughter is. So he takes matters into his own hands with horrifying results. Prisoners explores the subject of vigilante justice from a fresh perspective making the crusaders ordinary people who have no stomach for violence or torture but must force themselves to cross moral lines for the sake of their loved ones. And the movie makes the dilemma increasingly intense by keeping the viewers guessing about Alex along with everyone else When he takes his dog for a walk he stops to briefly torture the animal in a shockingly sadistic manner then continues on his walk as if nothing had happened. Is he really a diabolical killer? Or he is just as the authorities believe simply a severely mentally challenged person? Shot by the great Roger Deakins Prisoners looks fantastic whether its a strangely unsettling close-up of a tree or a sensational sequence in which a character is speeding to the hospital dangerously weaving through traffic at high speeds. The movie is filled with religious iconography and subtexts that are used for more than window dressing (a priest becomes a small but critical part of the story) and theres a suspenseful sequence in which Loki investigates the home of a suspect that achieves David Fincher-Seven levels of creepiness. Too bad then that after two hours of such relentless tension Prisoners starts revealing its secrets to progressively hokier effect. In its final 30 minutes Prisoners leaves the realm of frightening plausibility and edges into horror-movie turf turning what had previously felt like genuine human evil into a monster that is easy to explain away. The sudden shift feels jarring and fake -- its incredibly frustrating -- but none of it negates the phenomenal performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal playing two men racing toward the same finish line but using radically different methods to get there.

The police pick up a likely suspect -- and then let him go for lack of evidence. What do you do? That is the start of ""Prisoners"" a film which starts out like any number of recent Liam Neeson pictures. Hugh Jackman is the star here and we know the drill - vigilantism brutalism revenge. And from the audience approving cheers. But ""Prisoners"" is smarter and trickier than that as it begins to develop a serial-killer mystery that has elements of ""Zodiac"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" -- and a moral complexity that few movies like this even bother to consider. Because as Jackman pursues his quarry -- and his methods grow more and more violent -- the certainty that this is even the right man begins to blur. And the scope of the crime begins to deepen. Directed by Canadas Denis Villeneuve -- who made the similarly complex ""Incendies"" about Mideast terrorism -- its a story set in rural Pennsylvania and in a community where crucifixes are as common as gun racks. In fact the question of faith runs throughout the film as one traumatized family tries to cling to hope and other even more damaged people fall into soul-deadening despair. Jackman is terrific as Keller a deeply traditional working-class man who sees himself as his familys staunch unshakable protector. And when in his eyes he fails at that job he starts to lose his grip. Because if hes not that then what is he? Jake Gyllenhaal is fine too as the detective on the case and Terrence Howard as another worried father Maria Bello as Jackmans wife and Melissa Leo as the suspects fiercely protective mother round out and enrich the cast. Villeneuve gets his shocks from unexpected places too. Like a dusty cellar filled with the cast-off statues of saints. Or a room full of padlocked storage boxes the lids punched full of air holes. Or the sound of a circular saw suddenly roaring to life. True sometimes the movie is a little too cute for its own good unfairly full of flagrant red herrings (Why for example is Gyllenhaals detective named Loki? Um no reason really.) At other times it pushes the laws of probability a bit too far or leaves a detail unexplained. But this is a coldly gruesome tensely thrilling drama that both dares to take its time (it clocks in at almost two-and-a-half hours) and refuses to let anyone off the hook -- right up until its chilling just-ambiguous-enough ending. Is it the best Hollywood mystery weve seen in awhile? Oh yes. Is it one any parent would want to see? Only if they dont mind nightmares. Ratings note The film contains scenes of torture violence strong language and alcohol abuse. Prisoners (R) Warner Bros. (146 min.) Directed by Denis Villeneuve. With Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal.

Which is one thing ""Rush"" doesnt do Its a classic story of competitors on a headlong collision course a 450-horsepower movie traveling at 220 miles per hour. But for all its immersion in the roar grease and danger of Formula One the fact-based ""Rush""--about the sports great rivalry of the 1970s--is also more predictable than a pit stop something well-suited to Mr. Howard. Hes made perfectly palatable pictures but never a truly great one partly because he has such a weakness for the commercial and a consequent gift for the obvious. Nothing is ever suggested if it can be said out loud. Very little is beyond further simplification. And the two real-life personalities at the center of his story are so archetypal they may as well be a fuel-injected tortoise and hare. The British champion James Hunt ( Chris Hemsworth) dangerously handsome dangerous behind the wheel is in racing for the glory the fun and the not-always-well-chosen women. Hunts chief rival is Niki Lauda ( Daniel Bruhl) a Teutonic perfectionist with a matter-of-fact awareness of his own superiority no compunction about explaining it to anyone who questions him and a certain satisfied joy in describing a competitors failings to his face. He exists beyond arrogance but in close proximity to loathsome. Focused on the 1976 racing season ""Rush"" travels from the great European tracks to South Africa and Japan as the Hunt-Lauda rivalry--no other drivers seem to exist--seesaws back and forth with personal speed-bumps occasionally intruding on the aerodynamics At one point Hunts estranged wife the ravishing Suzy ( Olivia Wilde) takes up with the actor Richard Burton to the delighted agitation of the tabloids and Hunts vague displeasure. Laudas setbacks are far more serious. Without giving too much away his recovery involves scenes far more disturbing than anything that happens on the track. The great American car movies have usually involved crime (""Bullitt"" ""The Seven-Ups"") speed as an allegory (""Two-Lane Blacktop"") and the occasional one-off masterpiece (""Smokey and the Bandit""). The closest thing to ""Rush"" other than ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Le Mans"" is ""Senna"" the 2010 documentary about a later Formula One rivalry which had the real footage ""Rush"" often simulates. But what happens away from the racing often makes for the better ""Rush"" moments A sequence in which Lauda meets his wife-to-be Marlene ( Alexandra Maria Lara) and--at the behest of a couple of backseat Italians--speeds them all through the provincial countryside is simply wonderful a moment deeper felt than almost anything else in the movie. Like many directors whove made biographical films Mr. Howard cant resist showing in his movies closing moments photos of the real subjects something that always feels like a betrayal of the actors. Nevertheless the shots do show how close Messrs. Bruhl and Hemsworth come or dont to replicating the originals. Mr. Bruhl is equipped with a prosthetic overbite that not only enables him to chew more scenery but displays why Hunt always called his rival a ""rat."" The real Mr. Hunt who died in 1993 was not nearly as handsome as Mr. Hemsworth. But who is? With that long blond mane he suggests a young Brad Pitt and at times seems to be channeling both Peter OToole and Errol Flynn. His face is his fortune and maybe the movies too As was the case with ""Thor"" the advertisement for ""Rush"" is simply a closeup of Mr. Hemsworth. No smoke no lightning no race cars. And certainly no Niki Lauda. Despite being a schematic exercise in storytelling ""Rush"" does take one calculated gamble Neither of the protagonists is close to likable. Both are arrogant reckless unfeeling and ubercompetitive--qualities that no doubt make for world-class drivers but not for naturally sympathetic movie heroes. Its a smart twist on the usual though a calibration in a film about a sport in which everything is oversized except the margins of error. Working from a very clever script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") Mr. Howard doesnt pick sides. He lets two distinctly abrasive characters rub up against his viewers chafing them into gear. Watch a clip from the film ""Haute Cuisine"" the story of Daniele Delpeuch and how she was appointed as the private chef for Francois Mitterrand. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) Haute Cuisine ""Witty and brisk"" is not the name of a French breakfast cereal but it does describe a certain brand of French film the type that coquettishly flirts with comedy while sprinting in the direction of dry sophisticated charm. Such is ""Haute Cuisine"" which is based on the memoir of Daniele Delpeuch who served as private chef to Francois Mitterrand during several of his years as president of the republic. As played by Catherine Frot the heroine is a model of efficiency devotion to duty everything one might expect and one thing more The personification of creativity crushed by bureaucracy. ENLARGE Haute Cuisine Weinstein Co. As such that character here called Hortense Laborie elevates what might have been a rather gloriously photographed trifle (the seafood the patisserie the salmon-stuffed cabbages) into something considerably more something that has led Hortense--as we see in the entree to the film--to Antarctica. There among a platoon of researchers apparently more accustomed to gruel she has become beloved the Marianne of gustatory integrity. Unfortunately shes also become the target of an Australian television journalist who wants to tell her story. Its not a story Hortense necessarily wants retold. The viewer however is ready for the main course. Four years earlier in flashback Hortense is tracked down on her truffle farm by a brusque team of government emissaries who are as short on charm as they are on information They refuse to tell her where shes being taken but shes willing to be patient. As it turns out her destination--and her base of operations for the next several years--is the Elysee Palace in Paris. Mitterrand wants good simple food for himself and his guests. Hortense is given a mission. Shes also given a rogues gallery of bean counters pencil pushers and one corpulent cook with which to contend. She immediately becomes the bete noire of Lepiq ( Brice Fournier) the long-time ruler of the palaces main kitchen who views Hortense as an intruder a pretender and a threat. Worse shes a woman. There has never been a woman behind the stoves of the palace or allowed to wield the copper cookware that dates back to Louis-Philippe. She must be overthrown. Ms. Frot brings a sympathetic mix of determination and passion to Hortense who dedicates herself to making dishes that suit the president. Jean DOrmesson looks nothing like Mitterrand but seems a bit dotty and is treated more like a king. He certainly eats like one. The preparation of his meals--cockles steaming ducks being stuffed a Sainte-Honore cake being anointed with pastry cream--is hallucinatory. If some enterprising movie concessionaire offered the truffles on toast that Mitterrand enjoys during his late-night snack audiences would be streaming to the lobby to snatch them up. Even after the presidents doctors via the bureaucrats start making Hortenses work impossible she perseveres. For a while. Eventually shes going to head for Antarctica which is certainly a comment on public life and the concept of egalite Its warmer on the ice for Hortense and among diners who appreciate what theyre getting. Watch a clip from the film ""Prisoners."" When Keller Dovers daughter and her friend go missing he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads. Starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Prisoners Theres a near-sacred history in Hollywood of non-U.S.- born directors providing fresh perspectives on America. Milos Forman. Alfred Hitchcock. Ang Lee. Ernst Lubitsch. Billy Wilder. For ""Prisoners"" a stress-inducing trip into child abduction the director is Quebecois filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who gives us an American ""hero"" guaranteed to push many buttons many times and who might not have been allowed to be quite so awful under a different directors lens. ENLARGE Jake Gyllenhaal Warner Bros. That character Keller Dover ( Hugh Jackman) is a building contractor survivalist and devout Christian who drives a pickup truck sings ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in the shower and says an ""Our Father"" before helping his son shoot his first deer. He maintains a survivalists philosophy (""Pray for the best prepare for the worst"") and a basement full of canned goods. When catastrophe strikes he turns into a monster. In his new film ""Prisoners"" actor Hugh Jackman portrays a humble hardworking father whose daughter is suddenly abducted upending his carefully built life. The actor sat with the WSJs Barbara Chai to discuss ""Prisoners"" his future Broadway show ""Houdini"" and returning to the Wolverine in ""X-Men."" Read more at WSJ.com/Speakeasy Mr. Villeneuve leans heavily on ""Zodiac"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" for his mood and on screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski for his nightmare story. While Keller and wife Grace ( Maria Bello) celebrate Thanksgiving with their neighbors Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis Terrence Howard) their young daughters go outside and immediately go missing. An RV had been parked outside; the older kids say there was someone in it. Panic ensues as does rain which under the circumstances--aberrant religion informs the entire story--seems vengeful and Old Testament. The local police are on the case right away chiefly the departments ace detective Loki ( Jake Gyllenhaal) who tracks down the camper arrests the driver Alex Jones ( Paul Dano) and decides hes got the wrong guy. Alex is too simple-minded to have abducted two preteen girls in broad daylight and hidden them away. Loki moves on. Keller cant. In addition to the skin-crawling camera moves and the understated dread that bolsters the surface tensions of ""Prisoners"" there is a fascinating actors duel going on. Mr. Jackman is all seething anger and righteous pain; his character clearly wants to be an avenging angel as he kidnaps Alex and tries to torture the truth out of him. Mr. Gyllenhaals performance is different. He internalizes Lokis evident problems which include an insubordinate contempt for his higher ups a supreme confidence in his own investigative judgment and the kind of control over his passions that is very deliberate and fragile. Mr. Jackman may well get awards. Mr. Gyllenhaal gets our attention. After Tiller Nothing has encapsulated the craziness of the so-called abortion ""debate"" than the murder--in church--of George Tiller by an antiabortion religious zealot. So it takes a bit of imagination to think that even a movie as sober and sobering as ""After Tiller"" will have much useful effect on an issue so seemingly immune to reason. Directed by Lana Wilson and Martha Shane ""Tiller"" addresses the issue of late-term abortion by sweeping aside rhetoric and hysterics providing valuable information (i.e. that such abortions account for less than 1% of the total in this country) and delivers a useful debunking of certain ideas including the notion that ending a pregnancy in the final trimester is something done casually as birth control or without enormous anguish on the part of both patient and doctor. ""It seems barbaric"" agrees Dr. Shelley Sella. ""Unless people understand whats going on with the woman its impossible to support."" ""After Tiller"" may not be an exhaustive study of the issue but it does provide some understanding. Rewind You Can Count on Me (2000) ENLARGE You Can Count on Me Directed by Kenneth Lonergan (""Margaret"") this bittersweet story of a drifter brother and his stalwart sister proved to be a breakout for both Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney who earned her first Oscar nomination as a single mother in upstate New York juggling her son her brother and her miserable boss played with pitch-perfect petulance by Matthew Broderick. Once described as a film about ""beautiful losers"" it is just that and Mr. Lonergan and company make it all very memorable. Jon Tenney and Rory Culkin also appear. Mr. Lonergan wrote the screenplay. Senna (2010) ENLARGE Senna Director Asif Kapadias portrait of Brazilian Formula One legend Ayrton Senna--and his ugly rivalry with French driver Alain Prost--was the beneficiary of the ban against cigarette advertising on television Tobacco companies desperate for exposure starting channeling their ad money into racing sponsoring drivers pasting logos on everything that moved and filming every race with multiple cameras. Mr. Kapadia given unprecedented access to the Formula One archives was able to make a nonfiction film with the same kind of visual storytelling options available to a Hollywood director. The result One of the better documentaries on the theme. Zodiac (2007) ENLARGE Zodiac Jake Gyllenhall plays the obsessive rather than the detective--the cop is portrayed by Mark Ruffalo--in this highly atmospheric David Fincher thriller shot with characteristic moodiness by Harris Savides. Based on murders committed in the Bay Area during the 1960s and 70s by a murderer known as Zodiac it also stars Robert Downey Jr. who eats a bit of scenery as the reporter assigned to the case but is as fascinating to watch as Mr. Gyllenhaal who is driven from boyish to bonkers by a serial killer with a flair for the dramatic. And whose identity remains unknown. 10 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo AP Movie Review Prisoners 3.5 Stars. Top-drawer thriller. Running time 153 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence torture) At the Ziegfeld the Lincoln Square the Cinema 1 others. Is torture ever justifiable? A twisty compelling brilliantly acted (if sometimes difficult to watch) thriller ""Prisoners"" asks this question not in the usual contemporary context -- anti-terrorism -- but instead as a gruesome option deployed as a response to every parents worst nightmare. Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his career as Keller a macho Pennsylvania carpenter who goes extreme vigilante when the cops are forced to release the only suspect in the disappearance of his 6-year-old daughter and her friend from their quiet suburban street after Thanksgiving dinner. Alex (Paul Dano) a creepy 20-something who is said to have the IQ of a 10-year-old was arrested on the night of the disappearance driving an RV that the missing girls were seen playing near. But cops cant find any physical evidence linking him to the abduction and hes let go after 48 hours behind bars. Keller however is convinced that a cryptic remark that Alex made to him -- which nobody else heard -- is incriminating and that if he doesnt take the law into his own hands the girls will soon perish in captivity. Keller snatches Alex locks him up in an abandoned apartment building he owns and begins trying to hammer a confession -- or at least the girls whereabouts -- out of the terrified suspect. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the police detective in charge of the investigation in ""Prisoners.""Photo AP At the same time a different approach is being taken by Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal like Jackman in career-best form) the no-less-driven gonzo police detective whos in charge of the investigation. Flouting the rules he searches the home of a drunken priest with a past (Len Cariou) and turns up the mummified corpse of a bound man in the basement -- the priest says the man had admitted a series of child murders 26 years earlier. French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve making his English-language debut after the Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"" keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat with a film where nothing is quite is what it initially seems -- and where another creepy young man surfaces as a second suspect an hour in. Without giving away anything essential by this point Loki is not only trying to find the missing girls but also trying to figure out whether Kellers increasingly suspicious behavior -- he frequently leaves his wife (Maria Bello) who has her own mental health issues alone for the night -- has anything to do with Alexs disappearance. Not everything in Aaron Guzikowskis script seems strictly credible. I especially doubted whether Keller could enlist -- however briefly and reluctantly -- his neighbors the other missing childs parents (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) into his increasingly grisly homemade rendition program which includes scalding showers for Alex. You could probably level the same accusations against ""The Silence of the Lambs"" another intense police procedural that was nevertheless so utterly gripping that you could easily suspend disbelief. Villeneuve does a great job of modulating the mood (including some gallows humor) of a film that seems headed toward one conclusion then veers toward another over 21/2 of the fastest-moving hours Ive seen in a recent movie. Justly Oscar-nominated for ""Les Miserables"" last year Jackman doesnt have to sing at the top of his lungs with a camera pointed down his throat this time. But he does a brilliant job of painting a seemingly unlikely character (a Christian survivalist with a black best friend) and maintaining a surprising degree of audience sympathy -- and complicity -- when Keller does the unthinkable. Gyllenhaal so good in last years underseen ""End of Watch"" matches him stride for stride as Loki who sports a huge neck tattoo and like Keller is battling his own personal demons. There is also terrific work by Dano and Oscar winner Melissa Leo as Alexs guardian -- both playing characters whose motives the film repeatedly challenges the audience to sort out. ""Prisoners"" which never preaches about morality builds to a surprising conclusion that gratifyingly defies Hollywood formula.

AP MCT Prisoners Director Denis Villeneuve Cast Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Rated R (disturbing violent content including torture strong language throughout) Running time 153 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1113pm on Thursday Sep. 26 2013 Thursday Sep. 26 2013 Thursday Sep. 19 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Anyone who pays even passing attention to the trailers and commercials for Prisoners may think they have a handle on what this movie is about Hugh Jackman is an aggrieved father on the hunt for his kidnapped daughter and hell leave no stone unturned -- or face unpunched -- until he finds her.Its Taken recast with Wolverine in the lead. The script pretty much writes itself complete with vigilante violence easy resolution and audience catharsis. Cue up Prisoners II for next year.But thats not what French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (whose 2010 film Incendies was nominated for a Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar) and writer Aaron Guzikowski ( Contraband) have in mind. Grim gray and surprisingly gruesome Prisoners -- the directors first foray into English-language filmmaking -- has its flaws but predictability is not one of them.Jackman is Keller Dover a Pennsylvania home remodeler who prides himself on protecting his family whether its teaching his teenage son (Dylan Minnette) to hunt or keeping a well-ordered survivalists pantry in the basement. But his sense of order is shattered when while having Thanksgiving dinner with neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) his daughter (Erin Gerasimovich) and the Birchs daughter (Kyla Drew Simmons) are snatched off the street in broad daylight.The immediate suspect is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a guy sleeping in an RV parked near the house. The trouble is that Alex has the mind of a 10-year-old is in the care of his aunt (Melissa Leo) and has no real idea whats going on. Lead investigator Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has no choice but to let him go because theres no evidence linking him to the crime.Thats when Keller takes matters into his own hands and in a lesser movie this is where viewers get to root for him as he knocks heads together. Instead Keller sinks to the level of abuser as he kidnaps Alex locks him in a room and tortures him all the while guilt-tripping and browbeating the Birches into helping him do it. The torture scenes are difficult to watch. This isnt horror-movie histrionics; it feels real and violent.All the while the methodical Loki -- whose distracting exaggerated blinking is either supposed to signify OCD or an odd acting choice on the part of Gyllenhaal and the director -- is looking for evidence to pin this on someone. Alex? The strange guy in the hoodie at the candlelight vigil? Maybe Keller himself?Villeneuve matches the emotional mood with a gray color palette -- it always seems to be raining or just about to -- and a sense of quiet claustrophobia. As a director Villeneuve is definitely someone to watch.Though it sometimes seems when he explodes in rage that Jackman is channeling his inner Jean Valjean the acting is impressive especially that of Howard and Davis as parents torn between their anger at Alex for his alleged crime and Keller for sapping them of their humanity.The trouble is that the movie at 153 minutes goes on too long. And its questionable whether the resolution is worth a two-and-a-half-hour wait. We get it Were all prisoners at some level. But the audience may feel that theyre the ones imprisoned.

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Viola Davis Paul Dano Maria Bello Terrence Howard Melissa LeoRated R; runtime 2 hours 33 minutes; opens Friday nationwideThe ever-present grey skies in Prisoners mirror its murky shades of morality.A somber twisting and thoroughly engrossing police thriller (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) Prisoners focuses on a decent man who takes the law into his own hands and in the process loses his humanity.Centered on a kidnapping the plot raises complicated moral questions about how far an anguished person will go for the love of a child. At the same time it sets up an intricate horrifying mystery with breathtaking skill.French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who made 2010s captivating Oscar-nominated Incendies has fashioned a film that is both mainstream and artful. Prisoners is infused with a poetic intensity thats rare in American thrillers. The closest cinematic comparisons would be Zodiac In the Bedroom and Mystic River.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In Prisoners two young girls are kidnapped and one dad takes justice into his own hands. The film stars Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Terrence Howard and Maria Bello. VPCRain-streaked visuals by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins intensify the ominous mood.On a drizzly Thanksgiving Day in suburban Pennsylvania two families meet for a holiday feast. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) have two children teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and 6-year-old Anna (Erin Gerasimovich).The movie opens with a tense scene in which Ralph and his dad go hunting and Ralph shoots his first deer. On the drive home he looks mildly stricken while his father congratulates him.The Thanksgiving meal is being held at the home of neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) who have two children about the same age as the Dovers teenage Eliza (Zoe Soul) and 7-year-old Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).The teen siblings are put in charge of their little sisters but the girls pop outside to play and vanish. A festive occasion suddenly becomes a parents worst nightmare. Suspicions focus on a rusty old RV parked nearby and a creepy-looking neighbor Alex Jones (Paul Dano).The taciturn Alex lives with his lonely aunt Holly (Melissa Leo). His haplessness as well as a comment he mutters make Alex the prime suspect for the distraught Keller.Jackman tackles his role with steely ferocity giving one of the best performances of his career. Full of moral certitude he clashes with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) whos put in charge of the case.STORY Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal unguarded in PrisonersVIDEO Jackman reminds wife of Sexiest Man Alive title REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersGyllenhaal who did a fine job as a cop in last years End of Watch taps into even deeper reserves of emotion here for the role of a tenacious and decent detective who blinks repeatedly when frustrated as if trying to hold his personal demons at bay. Torn between his instincts and police procedure he is nonetheless determined to solve the case.Both men are single-minded. Keller does his statistical research on how long abducted kids survive and grows furious at the failure of authorities to act swiftly. Blinded by rage grief and a sense that he has failed in his promise to protect his family Keller plunges into a desperate search.Despite some holes in the labyrinthine plot the film concludes on a hauntingly powerful note. In its unflinching look at mutable morality the implications extend beyond the personal to the political.With its grisly realism Prisoners is much more terrifying than any horror film simultaneously grueling spellbinding and contemplative. 84 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1a7V7Zo,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/09/19/prisoners-review/2711889/,200,prisoners17,prisoners,usatoday

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 19 September 2013 0218 PM Updated 19 September 2013 0218 PM You can hear the gears clicking throughout Prisoners a gorgeous but manipulative thriller that wants you to ponder Big Questions as it sends a shiver down your spine. Nearly everything in this nightmare of child abduction works the head before the gut. Its got moral philosophy on its mind and it wants you to know it.Crime punishment guilt innocence vengeance Prisoners has thematic ambition to burn. The domestic idyll of a small-town Pennsylvania Thanksgiving is ruptured when two young girls go missing.One set of parents (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) seems content to let law enforcement do its job. Not so Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman goateed and severe). His wife (Maria Bello) zonked out on sleeping pills he puts his always-be-ready credo into action and takes a series of drastic and ill-chosen measures.Kellers actions strain not just the limits of justice but also plot credulity. Yes the victim becomes a criminal fueled by moral rectitude and Jackmans square-jawed righteousness. The words never appear on-screen but they might as well What would you do? Its a worthy question but here its weight has a way of obstructing the path of good storytelling especially when the finished product clocks in at 21/2 hours.This is one of those movies full of creepy suspects and fragments of clues left to gather like a trail of breadcrumbs. Theres the mentally and emotionally impaired man-child (Paul Dano) and his quietly protective aunt (Melissa Leo). Theres the weaselly misfit (David Dastmalchian) spotted buying kids clothes at the local thrift store and the drunken priest with a corpse (adult) in his basement. The pieces eventually add up but the process feels over-determined designed to make you stroke your chin as you leave the theater.The director is Denis Villeneuve who made the first-rate foreign-language Oscar nominee Incendies. Given a Hollywood budget for the first time Villeneuve proves a master shaper of mood and visual texture. He has a crucial collaborator in director of photography Roger Deakins who infuses sleepy roads with a sense of menace. Streetlights glow through rainy nights and one particularly haunting candlelight vigil gives the proceedings a sense of ethereal drama.Jackman has the showiest part and he lets the fury fly. But Jake Gyllenhaal keeps the whole thing grounded as the police detective who cant quite believe the freak show into which hes stumbled. Gyllenhaal has the gift of expressive eyes that register quick emotional shifts. Hes the audience surrogate in Prisoners our weary guide into the mouth of madness.I admire the craft of Prisoners and the loose ends of the mystery tie up nicely (even if the very last scene teases a bit much). I just never felt the raw-boned urgency that the stakes imply. (Oddly enough the similar films that hit me harder are both based on Dennis Lehane novels Ben Afflecks Gone Baby Gone and Clint Eastwoods Mystic River).Prisoners by contrast goes down more like a problem to be considered than an emotional experience to be savored.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.PRISONERSB Directed by Denis Villeneuve.

An underemployed contractor (Hugh Jackman) takes the law -- and a few things outside it -- into his own hands with regard to the man (Paul Dano) he suspects has kidnapped his daughter. Wilson Webb/Warner Bros. Prisoners Director Denis Villeneuve Genre Mystery thriller Running Time 153 minutes Rated R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout With Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Viola Davis If anyone thought Denis Villeneuves attacks on his favorite targets might be tempered by his move from the art house to Hollywood-thriller territory Prisoners should shut that line of thinking down in a hurry. Though the setting is new -- working-class Pennsylvania rather than Quebec and the Middle East -- the issues at play in Villeneuves Prisoners closely mirror those in the Canadian directors Oscar-nominated 2010 film Incendies the dangers of fundamentalism the pliable morality of religion when it comes to violence and vengeance and mankinds shocking capability for cruelty in the service of imagined righteousness. The vehicle for the directors investigations is similar too a tense many-layered plot-heavy mystery that he uses to apply a vise grip to the viewers attention while he hammers away at those themes. In Prisoners its the Thanksgiving abduction of two little girls and the subsequent investigations into their whereabouts. Theres the official inquiry led by the intense and idiosyncratic Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Then theres the unofficial one -- a vigilante campaign waged furiously by Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and reluctantly by Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) the girls fathers. Take Two NPRs Bob Mondello reviewed The Prisoner for Thursdays All Things Considered. Prisoners Filled With Twists And Turns And Moral Ambiguity Listen  354 354 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript Villeneuve is undeniably a master of slow-build tension. His patient deliberation is such that each time he pushes his camera in he might as well be turning the crank on a jack-in-the-box slowly so slowly that the wait for the next note in the song seems like a breathless eternity. I spent the first hour and 45 minutes of the film nervous uneasy fearing the impending doom in my chest. But Villeneuves film runs another 45 minutes beyond that and thats where the strings attached to the directors initially expert manipulations begin to show. The films moral and political issues share nearly equal footing with the machinations of the plot for much of the early going. That sometimes risks turning the films subtext a little too much into the text; long shots held on say the cross hanging from Kellers mirror or the gas mask in his basement punch up his Christianity and his survivalist impulses respectively in a way that ties them tightly -- unfairly? -- to the lengths hell end up going to in his effort to save his daughter. i Viola Davis plays the mother of a second kidnap victim; Jake Gyllenhaal is the driven -- and curiously idiosyncratic -- detective on the case. Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Viola Davis plays the mother of a second kidnap victim; Jake Gyllenhaal is the driven -- and curiously idiosyncratic -- detective on the case. Warner Bros. Those lengths will eventually include some decidedly extralegal measures -- vigilantism is too tidy a word for the tactics Keller employs -- and its no stretch to say that the abandoned small-town apartment building he uses as a kind of secret base of operations is an authorial stand-in for both Guantanamo and a CIA rendition site. But as unsubtle as both plotting and subtext are in this early part of the movie its as if they cancel each other out the one distracting from the other just enough to make both work. As we near the finish though the film grows less concerned with its moral conflicts and more with making the plots too many puzzle pieces come together neatly. Now we notice plot conveniences like the fact that Loki is constantly showing up in dangerous situations without asking for backup. It doesnt ruin the film but it does undercut that stellar first two-thirds as well as a pair of truly remarkable performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The former an actor of nearly impermeable likability manages to invoke feelings of both sympathy and antipathy -- genuine sorrow for his plight combined with a sense of being morally filthy just for having watched his actions. Meanwhile Gyllenhaals Loki is a rich collaboration between the actor wardrobe and makeup to create a character with enough back story to fill a few movies of his own. So much so in fact that its frustrating how little of that background comes to light to inform this movie. As it is Lokis tattoos his buttoned-up but tieless sartorial inclinations his slicked-back hair his tics -- theyre all idiosyncrasies masterfully rendered but weirdly lacking context. Loki is a skilled creation but lacking that sense of why its hard not to think of him as an artistic construct rather than a character. The same goes for Prisoners a work of impressive craftsmanship that winds up making us think too much about how it was fashioned rather than what it has to say.

"Prisoners | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prisoners ) Prisoners (United States 2013) September 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Whodunits are rarely a good playground for Hollywood films. The average mystery whether a stripped-down Agatha Christie-esque tale or a more complex endeavor is too demanding for the structural constraints of a motion picture. As a result when one is attempted its usually not difficult to identify the criminal and map out the general trajectory of the narrative. Running length and the concept of ""conservation of characters"" become stumbling blocks. Successes like Prisoners occur from time to time but they are exceptions. This particular whodunit works in large part because its interested in exploring more than just the question of which character is responsible for the crime. Aaron Gruzikowskis script as brought to the screen by Canadian-born director Denis Villeneuve examines issues of guilt innocence and desperation. Last year it was rightfully argued that the ""Oscar race"" began with the release of Argo in early October. This year the race starts a couple weeks earlier with the opening of Prisoners. Barring a truly phenomenal fourth quarter its hard to imagine Prisoners not being one of the titles among the Best Picture nominees. As mystery/thrillers go this one falls into the ""prestige"" area. The screenplay is smart the execution is impeccable and the holes are few and far between. Best of all it lacks the cookie-cutter element that infects too many of these movies. Although I figured out the puzzle before its explicit reveal I didnt put the final piece into place until shortly before that moment. Its rare that a movie keeps me guessing that long. As satisfying as Prisoners is from a mystery standpoint some will find it tough going. The subject matter - child abduction and possible child murder and/or abuse - will make some viewers uncomfortable to the point where they may not be able to watch the entire thing. There are no graphic scenes of child mistreatment but the importance of the topic to the narrative may be upsetting for some viewers. Prisoners isnt a ""feel good"" experience. Its dark straying into the territory where David Fincher enjoys spinning his yarns. The presence of Jake Gyllenhaal creates unintentional echoes of Zodiac. Theres nothing simple or straightforward about the story except the way it starts. Two neighboring western Pennsylvania families gather for Thanksgiving dinner. The Dovers headed by father Keller (Hugh Jackman) and mother Grace (Maria Bello) visit the Birches where dad Franklin (Terrence Howard) and mom Nancy (Viola Davis) preside over a huge repast. After dinner as the adults are talking and the teenagers are watching TV the two young girls - Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) - go outside. Time passes and they dont return. At first no one is alarmed but after a quick reconnaissance of the neighborhood doesnt turn them up they call the police. Enter Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) a lonely cop with a reputation for solving cases. The initial clues point to a suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) but it turns out that he lacks the mental capacity to successfully orchestrate a kidnapping. Nevertheless circumstantial evidence points to his involvement and a grief-stricken Keller decides that if the police cant or wont wring a confession from Alex hell do it himself. Weve seen this sort of thing before most powerfully in the Paradise Lost documentaries - how the public need to ""solve"" a crime can trump the innocence of suspect. Closure demands the identification of a malefactor. The problem is that no matter how convincing the case may be against that person it isnt always everything and the truth may lie in the missing pieces. The most compelling argument against capital punishment is that you cant resurrect a wrongly executed man. Theres something of that in Prisoners. The narrative is strewn with seemingly disconnected clues and unanswered questions. Does Alex whisper something to Keller during an encounter and if so what does he say? Who lives in the house near where the alleged abduction takes place? What secret is the alcoholic priest hiding? Who is the mysterious figure at the vigil? What are the significances of mazes and snakes? And whats the role of God and religion in all this? Gruzikowskis screenplay ties these elements together with precision. In hindsight its easy to see how everything falls neatly into place. Nothing about Prisoners is haphazard or poorly thought out. The cast is remarkable. Five of the seven principal cast members own previous Oscar nominations. (The exceptions are Maria Bello and Paul Dano.) With such a powerhouse roster one expects strong performances and those are forthcoming. Hugh Jackman in particular is noteworthy - he shows more depth than in any previous high-profile role including Les Miserables for which he received his nomination. Jake Gyllenhaal brings his craft to a new level as a world-weary detective who would have been at home in a classic film noir. Bello Dano Viola Davis Terence Howard and Melissa Leo all contribute effective supporting work. If theres a blotch - and its a small one to be sure - its that the makeup used to age Leo looks like well makeup used to make someone look old. Prisoners is a thriller for grown-ups. This is the only time of the year when we get those. It doesnt pander to the least common denominator. It doesnt shirk from asking difficult questions and tackling uncomfortable issues. It isnat afraid of generating an emotional response but doesnt manipulate the audience to get it. Most of all its unconcerned about the frustration that might arise from an inconclusive ending. Denis Villeneuve has made the film he wanted to and refreshingly it defies many of Hollywoods tenets about what constitutes ""crowd pleasing."" Powerful movies are often disconcerting and Prisoners is no exception.

The acting is amazing and the director wonderfully crafted a tense mood throughout this film. However I feel like the whole point of this movie (People of faith always lose faith or act hypocritically in the face of dire situations) is an insult to people like Wilma Derksen who had the exact same thing happen to her but immediately chose forgiveness. ghostdinisaid on Friday October 18 2013 115516 PMI think the film was perfectly paced not too long at all. The dreadful tone never lets up and the long length milks that for all its worth. Mikesaid on Thursday October 17 2013 11554 PMI agree totally with Richard here. I hope Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal earn Oscar nominations. This is the movie the 1992 American remake of ""The Vanishing"" tried to be.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Prisoners Share Comment At 21/2half hours ""Prisoners"" often groans under the load of its own self-importance. But Denis Villeneuves kidnapping thriller -- about the disappearance of two little girls and its aftermath -- is as gripping as it is grueling with performances that swing for the fences and a knotty central mystery. Hugh Jackman plays the most volatile of the four parents -- he gives off fumes of self-righteousness even before he chains the leading suspect (Paul Dano) to a sink -- and Jake Gyllenhaal counterbalances him as the smart increasingly stressed detective on the case. Villeneuve is aiming for the brass ring of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Zodiac"" and he comes pretty close. With Viola Davis Terrence Howard and Maria Bello.

September 19 2013 -- 335pm Warner Bros. Hugh Jackman threatens Paul Dano in ""Prisoners."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert In the hands of masterful filmmakers an often-told story can make for haunting drama. In ""Prisoners"" two families are pushed to the brink when their daughters vanish following Thanksgiving dinner. One girls distraught father Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and the investigating Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) launch rival hunts for the culprit and the victims. Its a potboiler premise but in this uncompromisingly dark telling it veers from the procedural to something deeper and more tragic. The pacing the framing the performances and sense of milieu mark this as intelligent ambitious work. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski have set out to make something more than just another missing-persons thriller -- even though as a thriller its terrific with urgent tension and suffocating suspense. Roger Deakins chilly cinematography imbues the setting a mundane working-class Pennsylvania community with a charge of free-floating dread. The film considers the anguish of ordinary people in extraordinary situations. It keeps us with its characters as their lives are deformed by the apparent kidnapping. Even after its been established that the girls are gone almost no one can believe it. Dover a builder and hunter looks for a way to speed the case through direct action. His wife (Maria Bello) withdraws into a haze of self-medication. Their friends (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) equally shellshocked by their childs disappearance go numb with pain. The men join search teams combing the woods for clues but there are none. The characters find themselves facing the grim chaotic reality of a world where all comforting assumptions and assurances have collapsed. The prime suspect is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a moon-faced loner with a childs mental capacity. The police question him -- his stillness is pregnant and scary -- and release him for lack of evidence. There is no trail of taunting clues just dead-end leads and eerie silence. The film runs a grueling 153 minutes giving us the sense that were trapped in the story too 10 steps behind in a tragedy were unable to change. It unfolds at a pace that reveals the disappearances as a community tragedy in which the traumatic past sends venomous tentacles into the present. Dover loses faith in the authorities and begins his own urgent search which could interfere with theirs. Hes a loving father and husband but hes unstable -- damage that the film takes its own good time to reveal. Every actor down to the supporting players is note-perfect but the film is a special triumph for Jackman who hits notes of animal agony while also suggesting the subtle ways that Dovers own childhood left him scarred. He has carved out an adult life by tamping down the hurt and the stress of crisis is about to undermine his carefully constructed facade. PRISONERS  out of 4 stars Rating R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout. Villeneuve guides his cast to put the characters torment in your bloodstream. Dover who thinks that Jones is obviously guilty brutally interrogates him. The film asks difficult questions about justice personal responsibility and the human condition in harrowing scenes of physical abuse. You dont have to probe too hard to uncover layers of harrowing social allegory and religious imagery as well. Although the story delivers a solution its not about the solution. It is about the way violence penetrates and corrodes the soul the characters journey and powerful scenes that test the actors limits. Villeneuve understands that the deeper the passions the more understated film technique must be. He knows when to cut loose -- a hair-raising car race is as thrilling as any Ive seen in the past decade -- but more important he knows when to employ chilling restraint.

Prisoners review Film fades after strong start 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Prisoners Drama. Starring Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Viola Davis and Maria Bello. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. (R. 144 minutes.) Its easy to get lost in the first hour of ""Prisoners"" and thats a terrifying thing. A superb acting ensemble and smart filmmaking choices help to create an honest portrait of struggling middle-class America before their relative serenity is disrupted tragically. Two young girls go missing and there are no tip-offs in the narrative or performances that suggest whether the ending will be happy or unspeakably sad. The last 40 minutes betray this truth in ways that are often perplexing. Its difficult to remember a recent movie that soared so high before plummeting with a series of bad story choices. But the end result is still a strong piece of cinema a failure only if you dwell on what might have been. ""Prisoners"" begins with a bold touch A father teaching his son to shoot a deer but not until he says a Hail Mary. So much subtlety is conveyed in this scene and the truck ride after where Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) passes on the familys code of honor to his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette). This scene is packed with information - Keller is a moral man an angry man and a little paranoid - and yet it doesnt feel like obvious exposition. Nothing in the beginning of the film feels forced or cliched as we see the Dover family join the Birch family for Thanksgiving and then watch their lives unravel as a daughter from each family disappears. Traits that we barely noticed in the first scenes are amplified by the experience. Keller and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) spiral into alcohol and drug abuse. Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) are not prone to action and their indecision becomes its own liability. The driven lead detective who seemingly has no life (Jake Gyllenhaal) must confront a lonely existence where his self-worth hinges on solving every case. The twists and turns are initially gripping especially after an emotionally vacant suspect played by Paul Dano is thrown into the mix and draws out Keller Dovers capacity for brutality. Jackman is particularly convincing playing against type in a bad haircut and layers of clothing that hide his matinee looks. Hes the type of guy whom a partner might marry for security knowing that romantic gestures will be few and far between. Director Denis Villeneuve makes wonderful choices throughout the first two acts. Hes aided greatly by perhaps the greatest living American cinematographer Roger Deakins once again in top form. But an uneasy feeling creeps up when some too-obvious clues start to cross the investigators path. Later a series of coincidences lucky and unlucky breaks and flat-out nonsensical decisions by key characters further sabotage the plot. By the end youll swear you ran to the bathroom and missed something - or nodded off and sleepwalked into another theater. What started out feeling like a Cormac McCarthy novel ends like one of the more far-fetched James Patterson ""Alex Cross"" thrillers. Running at nearly 2 1/2 hours ""Prisoners"" feels oddly incomplete. How audiences feel about the film depends on their level of pessimism. Was a great movie ruined by poor story choices? Or did the excellent filmmaking rescue the poorly executed finish? Mitigating circumstances in Villeneuves favor Even when audiences start to question the logical leaps the performances and visuals remain first-rate. The movie doesnt feel bloated. And the final scenes are anything but a cop-out. The resolution may seem like a stretch. But its terrifying nonetheless. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Area theaters. Its easy to make a thriller. Its hard to make one that says something about human nature and then like the hauntingly compelling ""Prisoners"" finds something inside the genre that validates tying your nerves up in knots. On a gray Thanksgiving Day in Pennsylvania Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) his wife Grace (Maria Bello) their teenage son and 5-year-old daughter cross a suburban road to the home of their friends the Birches. Keller and his son spent the morning hunting deer and their kill is being prepared for the table. But after dinner panic sets in when the Kellers girl and her friend the daughter of Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) disappear while playing outside. A camper truck was seen nearby and the parents focus on that with a local police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) who tracks it to the home of elderly Holly Jones (Melissa Leo) and her nephew Alex (Paul Dano). Twentysomething Alex is mentally damaged but was in the camper and Keller thinks he heard Alex mutter about the girls whereabouts. When Alex is released by police due to lack of evidence Keller decides to find things out on his own. Then this stealthily ethical thriller burrows deep into our own most primal state. Wanting information on his daughter Keller kidnaps Alex and continually beats and tortures him until he gets it. The vicious behavior is not done without conscience but in a strange way alongside it. Yet the detective has other leads. They include local creeps and the discovery of a corpse leading into a maze of violence and fear that Keller is now part of. Director Denis Villeneuve makes ""Prisoners"" more than what it seems as cinematographer Roger Deakins fills the snow-covered landscape with quiet dread. There are notions of lost and over-active faith and a murky situational morality. All of the characters are prisoners of something including Grace escaping her sorrow in prescription drugs. Its only when this edgy movie turns toward solving its mystery that it resembles ""Seven"" or ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Yet if Aaron Guzikowskis script has a tricky blueprint Villeneuve and the actors rise above. Gyllenhaal is full of twitches his skin sallow eyes sunken. Jackman big as an oak makes Keller more powerless as his brutality rises putting a weary face to fear and ferocity Dano Bello Howard Davis and Leo (nearly unrecognizable) are equally strong. Villeneuve whose last film was the Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"" uses them all perfectly and ""Prisoners"" works best when it isnt what you thought it was going to be. But even on familiar ground its hard to shake off. Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs.-Sun on New Yorks WOR 710-Am and at wor710.com.

Then it holds us under. More about Prisoners >> When two girls vanish off the meandering streets of what is ostensibly Montgomery County Pennsylvania it sets off a dismaying ever darker chain of events. Weve become all too familiar with the alarming rituals associated with child abductions the lines of police and volunteers walking the fields and woods searching for bodies; the candlelight vigils; the TV news trucks besieging the familys house; the rousting of all the registered sex offenders in the immediate area. Both sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) lose it but Jackman (the Aussie is slightly over-the-top as a blue-collar American) really snaps. He becomes convinced that a developmentally disabled suspect (Paul Dano) took his daughter even more so after the local police are forced to release Dano for lack of evidence. Jackman is driven by something far more powerful than proof suspicion. This is where Prisoners really starts to tear you up. Because while you completely understand the motives driving this distraught dad you cannot live with the results. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve pulls off a dastardly trick here manipulating the moviegoer to feel complicit and guilty about Jackmans vigilante rampage. Youre pummeled with the keen dehumanizing anguish of the perpetrator as well as the terror of his victim. It grows so quiet during this powerful almost punishing film that you become intensely aware of the slightest tics in the soundtrack. The theater becomes a prison. But Villeneuve has something devilish up his sleeve. Prisoners makes a late and unexpected turn into a mystery that is quite suspenseful. It takes a sly cast to spring this trap door. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the baleful blinking detective who coldly assesses what everyone involved in the case is telling him - and what they arent. Len Cariou and Melissa Leo shine in very unflattering roles he as an alcoholic priest she as Danos dowdy caretaker aunt. Consider carefully before going to see Prisoners. Its a striking film but the emotional toll it exacts is exorbitant. Prisoners  (out of four stars) Directed by Denis Villeneuve. With Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Maria Bello Viola Davis Terrence Howard and Melissa Leo. Distributed by Warner Bros. Running time 2 hours 26 mins.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it After his daughter and her friend go missing Kelly Dover (Hugh Jackman) loses his cool with suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in ""Prisoners."" (Wilson Webb) By Ann Hornaday September 19 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""Prisoners"" a crime thriller starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the early popular hits at last weeks Toronto International Film Festival earning rave whispers in the word-of-mouth fog that inevitably engulfs the 11-day event. As if that hype werent enough Canadian director Denis Villeneuve sent a written message to this weeks preview screenings thanking attendees for their ""interest"" in his film which in his humble words sounded for all the world like a sincere little passion project he and his pals cobbled out of a shoestring and a dream. In actuality ""Prisoners"" is a big-studio genre picture a familiar -- and undeniably well-executed -- example of pulp miserablism in the tradition of ""Seven"" and its grisly imitators. Given gravitas by Christian imagery and a mood of millennial survivalist desperation this pulp procedural joins a long line of films that sell themselves by way of the very depravity and malignant moral imagination they pretend to deplore. But if thats your jam hey ""Prisoners"" is pretty good. Jackman plays Keller Dover a Pennsylvania contractor who with his family has joined friends and neighbors the Birches (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their kids for Thanksgiving dinner when young Anna Dover and Joy Birch go missing. A local detective named Loki (Gyllenhaal) takes the case and when a suspect emerges a battle of wills ensues as Dover -- whose motto is ""Be ready"" and who keeps a gas mask generators and canned goods in his basement -- threatens to take matters into his own hands. As Dover plays out his long-gestating ultra-violent revenge fantasies -- all the while reciting the Lords Prayer a crucifix conspicuously dangling from his rearview mirror sermons playing on the truck radio -- he resembles generations of vigilante protagonists who engage in all manner of torture and abuse fired by unimpeachable rage. ""He stopped being human when he took our daughters"" Dover tells Franklin who stands for rationality and restraint but is played by Howard as a henpecked passive onlooker as events take their inevitable bloody course. The fact that Dover is never given a compelling ethical counterpoint -- other than Lokis lame ""I hear yous"" and his friends increasingly pained looks -- is just one way that ""Prisoners"" betrays its true allegiance pretending to engage viewers in reflective soul-searching but really giving them an excuse to indulge in vicarious sadistic violence with a righteous conscience. The reason ""Prisoners"" has achieved such serious purchase among critics and cineastes has to do with Villeneuves pedigree (he wrote and directed the highly regarded ""Incendies"" which possessed its own lurid plot pivot) and the fact that its superbly made. Shot by master cinematographer Roger Deakins in moody shades of gray and white ""Prisoners"" exudes despair and spiritual murkiness; Jackman and Gyllenhaal bring their A-game (and in Gyllenhaals case an unexplained eye tic) to roles that would otherwise be generic and Davis and Maria Bello are as usual flawless as wives and mothers waking up each day to the same but somehow brand new nightmare. The emotions the actors bring to bear on ""Prisoners"" are genuinely wrenching and theres no denying that Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski know how to ratchet up suspense and in one or two scenes nerve-jangling spook-outs. In that regard theyve delivered a grade-A genre exercise -- but its a genre predicated on specious reasoning and promiscuous pseudo-sacrificial suffering. Try as it might to entertain serious notions of manhood evil and original sin ""Prisoners"" works most effectively as Hollywood hypocrisy at its most sleek efficient and meretricious. Its stylish high-minded hokum.  R. At area theaters.

"Prisoners movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs In the hands of a vengeful dad in Prisoners  Twisty plot of Prisoners is a study in the stuff of parental nightmaresSeptember 19 2013|Michael PhillipsTension rises between a police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the father of a missing girl (Hugh Jackman) in ""Prisoners."" (Warner Bros.)Classy trash ""Prisoners"" opens with a scene of holy sacrifice the first of many violent acts sanctified as virtuous -- necessary -- by an increasingly grotesque narrative. In the Pennsylvania woods a carpenter played by Hugh Jackman guides his quiet teenage son (Dylan Minnette) in the killing of his first deer. A prayer is uttered. A shot is fired. The carpenter named Keller Dover is a true believer in the Lord and he gets results.Times are neither flush nor terrible but Keller scrapes to make his mortgage payments. He is a righteous man living for better circumstances. They do not come.The story moves to Thanksgiving dinner. He and his wife played by Maria Bello visit their neighbors for the traditional meal. Their hosts are a step up the socioeconomic ladder. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the Birches who like the Dovers have a preteen daughter. The girls who are friends disappear near the home. At first they seem more misplaced than lost. A frantic search ensues. No one is found.The police are brought in. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a loner detective named Loki who goes by the book wearily for a while until hes goaded into action by Keller. The rest of ""Prisoners"" which is an extremely well-made thriller dressed up in a few ambiguities for show follows Keller down a bloody rabbit hole leading to old unsolved murders and figments of evil very much alive and unwell.The specter of child abduction is enough to make most parents sick which is why most films (this one included) take pains to offer relief and solace through extreme brutality en route to a conclusion. Nothings bad enough for the perps of a novel or film such as ""Mystic River"" which ""Prisoners"" resembles somewhat though at its creepiest and most ambitious the film more strongly evokes David Finchers ""Zodiac."" ""Prisoners"" casts such an effectively sustained mood of dread in its first hour you hardly notice the familiarity of the mystery cliches and in particular the overstressing of one clue that renders a subsequent major plot revelation less than revelatory.Paul Dano worms around as Alex the chief suspect in the case a mentally challenged boy-man whose RV was seen near the site of the girls disappearance. Loki books him on suspicion but cannot hold him for lack of evidence. This allows Keller to become judge jury and potential executioner in the story kidnapping Alex (who knows more than hes telling) and handcuffing him to a grungy apartment bathroom sink away from the prying eyes of the law. The torturous beatings commence with and without instruments of pain in Kellers meaty hands. Theyre tough to watch. Were not meant to disapprove. Dano has played so many shifty unpleasant ferrets in his career the casting of this actor in this sort of part is shorthand for ""he has it coming no matter what.""Director Denis Villeneuve is the star here and he finds truth even in the junk aspects of ""Prisoners."" The Quebecois filmmakers work includes the remarkable ""Incendies"" and in ""Prisoners"" which was shot in Georgia he works closely with cinematographer Roger Deakins (making digital look nearly as rich and foreboding as film stock) to create a series of scenes interior and exterior that are grim trials of a parents soul. Eventually the plot throws in everything from puzzle pieces to actual serpents and because Loki (named oddly for the Norse god of trickery) isnt much of a character Jackmans Keller dominates the proceedings. Hes our Mr. Everyman with a hammer so sturdy of body and stalwart of earnest spirit Kellers righteousness is never long in doubt.Around the midpoint screenwriter Aaron Guzikowskis story starts layering in the red herrings and widening the circle of sleaze. Throughout this beautifully made slightly specious exercise in Old Testament revenge the character-study aspects of ""Prisoners"" coexist intriguingly with the grisly-inhumanity components. Some will take it and like it all the way to the heart of darkness. Others may feel theyve been jacked with manipulated. Villeneuve collaborates with unusual sensitivity with his actors. The script operates on one level; the interpreters on another higher level.mjphillipstribune.com""Prisoners"" - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughout)Running time 226Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHugh Jackmans Prisoners Trailer DebutsMay 30 2013Early Oscar Buzz 12 Years a Slave Prisoners Rock...August 31 2013Telluride Film Review PrisonersAugust 30 2013Box Office Prisoners Bound for 20 Million-Plus OpeningSeptember 20 2013Toronto Prisoners Director Makes 2-Year Deal With AlconSeptember 4 2013Find More Stories AboutHugh JackmanFilm StockPaul DanoTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0917-prisoners-20130919,0,5031376.column",200,prisoners30,prisoners,chicagotribune

Frustrated by the police departments lack of progress in locating his missing 6-year-old daughter a distraught father decides to take matters into his own hands. With Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Like the kidnapping at the tortured heart of ""Prisoners"" once this chilling thriller about a parents worst nightmare grabs you it refuses to let go.Even if the film wasnt coming out just months after the May rescue of three kidnapped women in Cleveland held for a decade by a madman we know the real world has monsters far more frightening than any Hollywood can manufacture. Reality informs ""Prisoners"" at every turn. French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski keep the tightly constructed terror twisting by holding it close.There are excellent performances from a well-seasoned cast including Viola Davis Terrence Howard Maria Bello and Melissa Leo. But the linchpins for the devastation wrought in the film are Hugh Jackman as an anguished father Jake Gyllenhaal as the frustrated detective with whom he locks horns and Paul Dano as the man suspected of snatching two young girls. PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013""Prisoners"" begins innocently enough on Thanksgiving Day. Keller Dover (Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Howard) are lifelong friends. Now married with children they live just down the block from each other in a Pennsylvania suburb where kids play carefree. Dinner is at the Birches -- good friends good food good times.Savor it. This is the last good moment the filmmakers allow.It is late afternoon. The teenagers Ralph Dover (Dylan Minnette) and Eliza Birch (Zoe Soul) are collapsed in front of a TV. The adults Keller and wife Grace (Bello) Franklin and wife Nancy (Davis) are in one of those conversations you imagine they pick up every time theyre together. Six-year-old Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and 7-year-old Joy Birch (Kyla-Drew Simmons) are bundles of energy begging to make a toy run to the Dovers house.And then they are gone.It takes a while to realize the girls are missing. But panic and fear are fast in coming. That scene -- where it first sinks in -- has a very ""there but for the grace of God"" feel. These are watchful parents. Each eventually becomes a template for the ways a child in jeopardy can change you.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsA sliver of hope comes in the form of a tenacious detective named Loki (Gyllenhaal). There is also a suspect Alex Jones (Dano) who is quickly in custody.And then hope dies.After 48 hours and no progress Loki releases Alex over Kellers outraged protest. Jackman who gives the performance of his career spends the rest of the film as a desperate father going rogue to save his child.This is no ""Taken"" where the dad is a black-ops specialist schooled in the art of tracking and torturing to find a missing daughter. The people in ""Prisoners"" are salt-of-the-earth types not equipped to find their girls and certainly not prepared to cope with the tragedy that is overwhelming them.A very different sort of family drama first put the director on the map. ""Incendies"" with its cross-cultural intrigues and Muslim-Christian conflicts earned an Oscar nomination for foreign language film in 2011. The polish and precision of ""Prisoners"" should keep Villeneuve there.Shot under a cold gray sky by acclaimed cinematographer Roger A. Deakins the mood of despair never lifts. Kellers decision to take matters into his own hands sets the course. Hes become convinced Alex is the key.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesA strange shy and nearly nonverbal young man still living with his aunt Holly (Leo) Alex is an easy mark when it comes to villains. So its not all that hard to get behind Kellers idea to pick up the interrogation the cops dropped.But things go badly almost from the start when Alex doesnt break as Keller thought he would. The larger question that begins to gather force as the action evolves is whether Keller is right to do what he is doing -- even if Alex is involved even with the childrens lives at stake. Or worse what if Keller is wrong about Alex entirely?The filmmakers dont make it easy to stay on Kellers side. Horrific brutality and unrelenting torture become the state of play as the desperation rises and the days tick past.At home Grace slips into a permanent haze of pills barely able to get out of bed much less notice her husbands long absences. It is left to the Birches to stand as the conflicted conscience of the film. Screenwriter Guzikowski tucks endless moral dilemmas into very smart dialogue as they grapple with what Keller is doing and their role in it.Like everyone else Det. Loki is a complex man with a lot on his mind. That he occupies any space on-screen is a credit to Gyllenhaal who continues to power through the darker roles hes favored lately. The actor tempers Lokis confidence with a twinge of doubt -- about Alex about Keller about himself -- and in doing so keeps his cop interesting. Meanwhile Dano seems born to play damaged souls though hes never reached such animalistic levels before.Jackman though is unforgettable as the father whose certainty never wavers. You feel Kellers resolve harden his anguish deepen and his spine stiffen. Not even the actors Oscar-nominated performance in ""Les Miserables"" is as compelling. Exciting terrifying worrisome stuff saturates every second of ""Prisoners"" holding you captive keeping you guessing until the bitter end.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PrisonersMPAA rating R for disturbing violent content including torture and language throughoutRunning time 2 hours 26 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Kidnapping Theater Hugh Jackman Reviews Jake Gyllenhaal On the Set Movies and TV Review Rush is a good ride but not a great one Movie review Prisoners is captivating and relentless Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-prisoners-movie-review-20130920,0,5009243.story",200,prisoners31,prisoners,latimes

CAST Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Paul Dano Erin Gerasimovich LENGTH 233 The less you know about ""Prisoners"" a labyrinthine mystery about a man searching for his vanished daughter the better. This much is safe to disclose Though its nothing you havent seen before its so artfully made and skillfully executed that you wont care a bit. The story initially seems like standard stuff In rural Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day two little girls (Erin Gerasimovich a Garden City 8-year-old and Kyla-Drew Simmons) from different families disappear. The Birches played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis stifle their grief while Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) investigates. The other girls father Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) however fixates on a mentally impaired suspect named Alex (a mesmerizingly blank Paul Dano). When Alex is released for lack of evidence Dover -- a home repairman and survivalist whose basement is filled with rope and lye -- takes Alex prisoner giving this movie its shivery title. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Thats a daringly dark turn of events for a Hollywood movie and ""Prisoners"" doesnt shy away from the possibilities. Dover begins by pummeling Alexs face into a bag of crimson tissue -- ""hurt him until he talks"" is his motto -- and is soon in full-blown Guantanamo mode constructing a ghastly torture-chamber for his victim. Never mind that Alex may be innocent. Dover is the kind of man who is absolutely and perhaps tragically sure of himself. This is serious well-crafted entertainment in the vein of moody procedurals like David Finchers ""Zodiac"" and Jonathan Demmes ""Silence of the Lambs"" (both probable influences here). Jackman and Gyllenhaal as men of bottled rage and explosive violence turn in electric performances while director Denis Villeneuve (2010s excellent ""Incendies"") creates an air of almost unbearable intensity. The chilly but evocative cinematography is by Roger A. Deakins (""No Country for Old Men""). The political subtext gives ""Prisoners"" an added resonance but that shouldnt be overemphasized. The script by Aaron Guzikowski throws in plenty of serial-killer chestnuts -- childlike drawings occult iconography a depraved priest -- which is to say that ""Prisoners"" is still just a movie. If only all movies were made this well. 233 MoviesPrisoners trailer PLOT The father of a missing daughter takes matters into his own hands. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R CAST Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Paul Dano Erin Gerasimovich LENGTH 233 BOTTOM LINE Sharp performances and a pervasive air of intensity turn this kidnapping tale into something finer and more artful.

Wilson Webb This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Hugh Jackman left and Paul Dano in a scene from ""Prisoners."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Wilson Webb) The first movie I ever reviewed for a newspaper was a revenge thriller called ""Extremities."" It starred Farrah Fawcett as a victim who takes her rapist hostage while her two roommates ponder the ethical dilemma of beating him to death with a fireplace poker. Aesthetically and intellectually it was a failure but because I was a young man and subconsciously felt I should suffer for keeping a Charlies Angels poster in my dorm room I gave it a passing grade.Half a lifetime later Im not so forgiving of bad movies. ""Prisoners"" has a pre-release buzz and Oscar nominees on both sides of the camera but its preposterous schlock masquerading as art. The emperors clothes are so porous they must have been beaten with a fireplace poker.You know youre on thin ice when you hear the protagonist reciting a prayer before you see his face. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is stalking a deer with his adolescent son so the prayer is a clue that the Pennsylvania roofer is either divinely attuned to the cycle of life or a bloody hypocrite. Its more like the latter because when Dovers daughter and another girl disappear while the extended family is eating the meat for Thanksgiving the deer-hunter turns into Mr. Hyde.The suspect in the abduction is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a simple-minded young man who trolls the neighborhood in an old RV. When he is cleared by local detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) Dover takes matters into his own hands kidnapping and torturing Alex in an abandoned apartment. Riding shotgun is Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) the father of the other missing girl. Like Franklins wife (Viola Davis) hes only partly appalled by Dovers violence deciding ""Ya gotta do what ya gotta do."" Its hard enough to accept that beloved star Jackman would play a character who is so sadistic but Dover is also dumb. When the ostensible hero swigs liquor in Lokis car while demanding justice he forfeits the benefit of the doubt. Stupidity suffuses the script written by ""Contraband"" scribe Aaron Guzikowski and directed by French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies""). Subplots such as a priest who keeps a dead body in his dungeon are left hanging in the noxious breeze. Meanwhile a detective who claims hes never failed to crack a case ignores the abundant evidence of a torture chamber on the other side of town. And a different detective professes ignorance that a suspect died a grisly death in the police station the day before even though it was the front-page story in the Daily Review. (The name of that newspaper is typical of the production values which are as generic as the characters. Acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins has rarely photographed such an ugly film.)The silence of the lambs who mistake this trash for treasure is deafening. Like the eponymous prisoners you have to drink a lot of Kool-Aid to endure this torture.What ""Prisoners""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 233  Content Disturbing violent content including torture plus strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Two young girls -- and justice -- held hostage Prisoners review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTwo young girls -- and justice -- held hostage Prisoners reviewIn Denis Villeneuves superb kidnap thriller Prisoners signs of God are everywhere while evil lurks -- and waits -- in the darkness.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 19 2013PrisonersStarring Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Terrence Howard Viola Davis Paul Dano Melissa Leo and Mario Bello. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. At major theatres. 146 minutes. 14AIn the superb kidnap thriller Prisoners signs of God are everywhere while evil lurks -- and waits -- in the darkness.Gospel music plays on the radio. Crucifixes hang above dashboards. And in a forest glen in a quiet Pennsylvania suburb a father named Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) recites The Lords Prayer as he catches a deer in his rifle crosshairs.Article Continued BelowDover a carpenter by trade and survivalist by instinct is showing his young son how to get fresh meat for the Thanksgiving table and also how to deal with life. As the rifle cracks and the deer falls Keller repeats his own fathers best motto ""Be ready.""In this first U.S. feature by Canadas Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) a runner-up audience award winner at TIFF 2013 such advice freezes in the chill fall air.MORE FROM THESTAR.COMFormer indie filmmakers go for Oscar gold at TIFF 2013Hugh Jackmans take-no-prisoners performance at TIFF 2013Theres no way to prepare for whats about to happen to this comfortable neighborhood -- and also to everybodys notion of whats right and whats wrong in desperate circumstances.Keller his wife Grace (Maria Bello) their friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their offspring have gathered to share the Thanksgiving feast.When Anna Dover 6 and Joy Birch7 ask permission to go outside to play for a while it is readily granted. This is a safe neighborhood.Then suddenly it isnt. Anna and Joy fail to return and parental pulses rise. A search turns up nothing except for the report of a suspicious white RV trailer now gone that the girls were spotted playing on.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) heads the police investigation. The square-jawed cop offers reassurances -- ""Im gonna find your daughters"" -- but he knows and so does the skeptical Dover that the odds of a safe return drop with each passing hour.As the clock ticks on and problematic suspect Alex (Paul Dano) emerges Dover turns vigilante. Hes not going to stand idly by while justice crawls even if the suspects caregiver aunt (Melissa Leo) insists that Alex is too meek and dim-witted to be capable of a kidnapping.If the cops wont take extreme action to force a confession and uncover possible leads Dover will -- and wouldnt any god-fearing parent do the same?Its a question many viewers will ask themselves especially those with children. Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) keep challenging our notions of civic propriety of whats the right thing to do in a wrong situation.Jackman and Gyllenhaal brilliantly play against each other like fire and ice the former an inferno of rage and impulsive behavior; the latter a cool exemplar of fearless police procedure. Yet both believe theres more going on than they can immediately grasp and that standard investigating techniques are insufficient in a countdown scenario.The supporting cast members all help shade in the details but Terrence Howard really stands out for his superbly contained portrayal of the parent who isnt willing to torch civility even if might lead to the rescue of his daughter.Prisoners uncoils with a serpents stealth -- and strikes just as suddenly. If you think the trailer tells you too much about the plot be assured that it only scratches the surface.Villeneuve adapts the slow reveals he mastered in the Oscar-nominated Middle Eastern drama Incendies for a more mainstream film but one that is every bit as powerful in its execution and resolution.Hes greatly aided by cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall) the auteur of natural light who brings a terrible beauty to even the most horrific of scenes.While Prisoners can be viewed on its most basic level as a chase thriller there is so much more going on that invites serious reflection.What kind of country is it whose people praise the Lord and sanctify due process while at the same time cocking the gun and resorting to vigilante justice?Prisoners is a potent commentary on modern life and fears and a triumph for Villeneuve.

RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Paul Dano talks Prisoners Essential Jake Gyllenhaal 5 best films 10 best thriller films ever made By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Sep 19 2013 951 AM One Thanksgiving a couple of families get together for food wine and friendship. Its a small Pennsylvania town; their houses are within walking distance. Everyone is having a good time until they realize that the two youngest daughters from each family have disappeared. Many thrillers begin in similar fashion. And ""Prisoners"" is above all an effective thriller but it wants you to take it more seriously than that. Theres no deal-breaking reason not to. Its too long a couple of character developments and actions ring a little hollow but really at least director Denis Villeneuve working from a script by Aaron Guzikowski is willing to push the audience to some unfamiliar places. Hes helped by a cast that includes Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal Paul Dano and Melissa Leo. This isnt really a case of characters not being who we think they are. Its more that we dont know what they can and will become. And that will about do it on the potential spoiler front. Jackman plays Keller Dover one of the dads a carpenter with a survivalist bent. He and Franklin (Terrence Howard) the other father quickly figure out that the girls had earlier in the day tried to climb on an old RV parked in the neighborhood which is now gone. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) quickly finds the RV whose driver Alex (Dano) tries to flee but is quickly caught. He is an exceedingly creepy young man with the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. It all seems pretty routine until the cops cant find any evidence that the girls were ever in the van. So they release Alex. This drives Keller nearly insane with anger. He attacks Alex and is further incensed. His reaction from there sets the rest of the movie in motion. Loki keeps snooping around slowly doggedly (hes solved every case hes had). Earlier crimes are alluded to but how do they fit in with whats going on now? This is a small town people remember things. Meanwhile Alexs Aunt Holly (Leo) takes him home. She too remembers the past. Roger Deakins cinematography leaves the town and the mood in a constant state of soggy dreariness. Its cold and dark and these characters given the situation could be forgiven for thinking the sun may never shine again. That look and feel are really effective. The acting is top-notch though Maria Bello and Viola Davis are given little to do as the grief-stricken mothers. Jackmans role is showier for reasons I wont divulge but Gyllenhaal is even better. You can tell by the tattoos on his neck and the look in his eyes that Loki has secrets. But Villeneuve doesnt feel compelled to let us in on them certainly not right away maybe never. In fact Villeneuve reveals each secret slowly if at all. This makes for a satisfying experience even if the film drags a bit in the middle. Oh and the title? It could be an apt description for almost any character in the movie at one time or another. The satisfaction is in finding out who if anyone will be set free.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Prisoners is an effectively moody child-abduction potboiler that spends much of its two and a half hour running time threatening to become some sort of allegory; however its religious themes and War On Terror imagery prove to be red herrings and while the movie is certainly less than the sum of its referents it nonetheless works as a formally controlled genre piece. Making his English-language debut Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) filters the thick-paperback plot--wherein two suburban girls go missing and one of their fathers kidnaps the man he believes was responsible--through an arty sensibility that favors terse pacing and purposeful camera movements that make the action seem more enigmatic than it really is. (Attentive viewers will be able to solve most of the movies central crime after about an hour.) The air of mystery takes precedence over everything else; one of Villeneuves favorite techniques involves shooting through rain-streaked windows and focusing on the glass turning the ostensible subjects of the frame into intriguing blurs. Set in Pennsylvania--though actually shot in Georgias Piedmont region which provides cinematographer Roger Deakins with plenty of opportunities to pan down hillsides--during the week following Thanksgiving Prisoners stars Hugh Jackman as the vigilante father who holds one-time suspect Paul Dano captive in a decrepit apartment building while police pursue other leads. (It doesnt help that Dano dressed in a turtleneck and big-frame glasses looks like the pedophile creep of suburban parents nightmares.) While Jackman subjects Dano to increasingly brutal torture top cop Jake Gyllenhaal tries to unravel the case the legal way. The presence of Gyllenhaal--combined with the movies chiaroscuro lighting emphasis on destructive obsession and many narrative dead ends--brings to mind David Finchers Zodiac; as if to underscore this Gyllenhaals character has zodiac signs tattooed on his knuckles and is introduced discussing the Chinese Zodiac with a waitress. But like the movies allusions to the need for religious meaning (which range from an opening recitation of the Lords Prayer to a sign for ""Valis Realty"") its Zodiac game is ultimately just a way to lend secondhand depth to a simple story. The villain isnt obsession or vigilantism (which the movie ends up tacitly condoning) but a real honest-to-God child-abducting bogeyman who provides the mystery with a sense of closure but exposes its Big Themes as mere pretensions. Still it makes for a compelling viewing experience thanks to Villeneuves formal chops and the uniformly strong performances including Terrence Howard as the father of the other kidnapped girl; in one long take framed around Jackman as he tortures Dano Howards face registers a sickly sense of complicity that displays a more complex worldview than all of Jackmans religious fervor.

So what bugs me about Denis Villeneuves ""Prisoners"" a grim gloomy and seemingly endless new thriller that arrives with considerable hype and stars Hugh Jackman Jake Gyllenhaal and a whole boatload of other well-known actors isnt exactly that. Its more that Villeneuve a highly regarded French-Canadian director making his Hollywood debut tries to convince us that hes making a serious and brooding film about the human condition or whatever when hes actually making classed-up manipulative trash. (I had exactly the same reaction to his Oscar-nominated ""Incendies."") Dont get me wrong I like trash just fine and the twisty-loo triple-abduction plot of ""Prisoners"" certainly kept me watching to the end. (Youll figure out some of screenwriter Aaron Guzikowskis plot twists but not all of them.) Its the imitation-David Fincher pretentiousness that gets on my nerves.""Prisoners"" features enough grimy realism twitchy overacting sheets of rain and gratuitous sadism for a half-dozen or so wannabe-Oscar movies about the dark side of the American dream the true nature of human brutality and so on. In fact its a lot more like a devious mind-game being played on the audience mixed with a condescending portrait of pill-addled rage-addicted and permanently downscale Middle America. (Were all prisoners blah blah blah. Deep) The film is set in a small city in western Pennsylvania (it was actually shot in Georgia) where the working-class families of Keller and Grace Dover (Jackman and Maria Bello) and Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) get together for a Thanksgiving feast. During the course of the evening the youngest daughters of both families go missing and suspicion falls on a dilapidated R.V. seen on their suburban street earlier in the day.Across town in a diner the cop who catches the missing-girls case Gyllenhaals Detective Loki - yeah hes named after the Norse god of mischief and if he has a first name I didnt catch it - is eating Thanksgiving dinner alone. Loki has odd tattoos on his neck and knuckles no emotional affect and no family slicked-back hair and a tic-laden manner that suggest he was a supporting character on either ""Sons of Anarchy"" or ""Breaking Bad"" before starting over as a cop in small-town Pennsylvania. I almost always like Gyllenhaal in everything and hes certainly captivating here but as with almost everyone in this movie I cant be sure whether this is good acting or bad acting. Either way theres a lot of it.OK I feel more confident about Hugh Jackmans scenery-devouring performance as bearded hothead Keller Dover whose response to his daughters disappearance is pitchfork-and-torches Amurkan-movie-dad nonsense. He brings the noise and he fills up the screen every time hes on it and hes absolutely dreadful. If Loki and the other cops are too pansy-ish and obsessed with ""constitutional rights"" to subject every conceivable suspect to a ""Zero Dark Thirty"" level of torture then by Christ Kellers gonna do it himself all while suffering multiple aneurysms drinking entire bottles of whiskey without opening them (after nine years sober) and scorching the entire town to cinders with the flames shooting from his eyeballs. Maybe someone shouldve told Jackman to leave both Wolverine and Jean Valjean at home but Im beginning to think he only has two modes Lovable song-and-dance man and bomb with a lit fuse. (The kind that says ""BOMB"" on the side and is commonly found in the possession of Wile E. Coyote.) You Might Also Like See that rundown R.V. seen on the families block belongs to Alex Jones -- not the conspiracy-theory radio-host guy (although that wouldve been cool) but a stringy-haired Coke-bottle-glasses Paul Dano character who is said to have the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. Loki supposedly the best detective this part of the Keystone State has to offer can get nothing out of this hapless dude and theres nothing suspicious in his R.V. Keller is convinced that Alex is taunting them and faking his mental deficiency and decides to go full-bore nutjob ""Oldboy""-style vigilante. Meanwhile Loki focuses in on a completely different suspect whos been snooping around the crime scene and buying childrens clothing in a thrift store - this part of the movie also involves suitcases full of snakes for no particular reason - and also encounters an elderly priest who claims to have a dead serial killer in the basement. So not only do we get a stranger abduction - an exceedingly rare crime - but a two-child stranger abduction followed by one of the parents committing a crime thats almost as bad followed by a possible copycat crime surrounded by a general atmosphere of 1990s-style child-abuse paranoia and followed by ... well Ill stop there. In fairness screenwriter Guzikowski does a halfway satisfactory job of making this all stick together in the end and as I said earlier theres at least one big reversal you wont see coming (partly because its barely credible at best). There are some clues along the way that arguably dont fit the hastily revealed final solution - or at least I think there are. Over the course of 153 battering minutes far too many of them spent in the company of Jackmans character making laughably bad decisions and yelling at everyone its entirely possible that I drifted away mentally and missed something. I kept watching for Gyllenhaal and because I wanted to see how it would all work out and because Roger Deakins is the cinematographer and the rain-sodden gloomscapes look great. ""Prisoners"" is compelling in a profoundly unpleasant way while youre watching it. But it doesnt mean anything or have anything to say and as soon as its over its gone. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Thats the key question of Prisoners Denis Villeneuves prestigious puffery about a father (Hugh Jackman) and a cop (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to catch a kidnapper. Prisoners is a dog whistle for Academy voters keyed to a pitch that screams ""For the love of God nominate me for something"" It might work except that (a) it makes no sense and (b) its not from Clint Eastwood the only director with enough swagger to demand such shlock be taken seriously. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Our setting is a gray Pennsylvania town the type where most of the houses are held together by cheap aluminum siding where an ordinary man like Keller (Jackman) can teach his son to hunt in case a hurricane blows civilization away. Keller is a survivalist with six stacked columns of Crisco in his basement and an innate certainty that he can do better than the experts. That includes Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) the soft-spoken crime solver charged with tracking down Kellers 6-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and neighbor girl Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) after they go missing on Thanksgiving afternoon.Keller admits he isnt the sharpest tool in the shed but he is the kind of guy who makes a point of keeping all his sheds other tools well-sharpened. Initially he begs Loki to help him make sense of the facts that dont add up Why was local weirdo Alex Jones (Paul Dano) a childlike near-mute parked in an RV by their street? Why did Alex try to escape when questioned by the police? And why cant Loki keep him in custody even though the only evidence Keller has to go on is a glint in Alexs eye? (Id add another Where in 2013 did Alex buy his Mark David Chapman glasses the windshield-sized spectacles that automatically tell people youre a creep?)Film Details Prisoners RatingR GenreDrama Running Time146 More Info Trailer Loki brushes him off with police platitudes -- ""Were considering all possibilities"" -- that dont even soothe Kellers sleeping pill-stupefied wife (Maria Bello). Loki doesnt realize Keller may be the only man in town brave enough -- and risky enough -- to take matters er make that Alex -- into his own hands. And fists. And hammers. And homemade torture chambers. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Villeneuve is interested in the raw ugliness of human desperation and parts of the film get so bleak that its surprising to learn its not a remake of something Swedish. But while Prisoners beats Dano into bloody tartare it still pulls its punches. As soon as he slices open Kellers conscience Villeneuve panics and tries to shove the meat back inside. Jackman does his damnedest to give Keller a monomaniacal conviction -- he does hollow-eyed agony better than the rest of Hollywoods muscle men -- but neither we nor Villeneuve ever buy him as anything but a blue-collar hero. The part needs either a real hothead a Michael Shannon type or a geek who cant believe hes breaking the Geneva Convention. Instead Prisoners tries to sway our sympathies toward the father of the other missing girl (Terrence Howard) who simply stands around Kellers makeshift interrogation room second-guessing his tactics while changing in and out of his nice slacks so they dont get spotted with blood. Hes useless.Prisoners wants to believe in an old-fashioned honor code. Its so macho that every female character is kidnapped drugged or sidelined to the margins of the plot -- even Viola Davis as Howards wife -- yet so in touch with the pressures of machismo that Jackman Gyllenhaal Dano and Howard compete for the most close-ups while crying.In their own way each of these guys is pressured to do right by his own responsibilities be they familial career survival or civic. But when their personal complexities start getting in the way of screenwriter Aaron Guzikowskis plot twists he and Villeneuve just throw away the parts that dont fit. They want a film that looks good blood and weeping scenes and stuff and dont care if it means hollowing out the storys internal logic. After two and a half hours of froth the final product is as grandiose and flimsy as a 12-foot sandcastle.Only Gyllenhaal recognizes this is B-plus fluff. He plays Loki with a dogged practicality that cuts through the histrionics. Hes a cop whos seen bad stuff before and knows hell see it again. Gyllenhaal has the face of a thug angel and the costumers have further roughed him up with a neck tattoo and a small cross inked on the web of his left hand -- hints of a past life that only merits a snatch of a sentence when Loki mentions surviving a Christian boys home where he learned to hate priests.Hes got a secret. Hell everyone in the film has a secret. But ultimately this is just an overbearing bluff a well-acted red herring that isnt interested in the whys of its melodramatic whats. Torn between making sense and arguing that the world itself makes no sense Prisoners is a captive of its own ambitions.PRISONERS | Directed by Denis Villeneuve | Written by Aaron Guzikowski | Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Review A riveting Prisoners - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview A riveting PrisonersBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 09/18/2013 104833 AM PDTUpdated 09/18/2013 044009 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki in ""Prisoners."" (Courtesy Wilson Webb/MCT) <<123>>""Prisoners"" is many things A contemplation of the nature of evil. A morality play about how far someone will go to protect loved ones. A complex character study.Most of all the film is a compelling mystery-thriller one thats absolutely riveting even at an imposing running time of two hours and 30 minutes. Despite some flaws it is everything a good drama should be -- challenging thoughtful disturbing -- from the beautifully crafted opening sequence to an ending that ... well to reveal it would be spoiling things.""Prisoners"" the first American and the first English-language movie by the fine French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is set in a working-class Pennsylvania suburb that is still rural enough to be surrounded by rugged woods. Its the holidays and the winter chill leaden skies and icy drizzle permeate every scene. The central figure is Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) a carpenter and survivalist who works hard to provide for his wife Grace (Maria Bello); teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette); and little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). The family is spending Thanksgiving with their neighbors and best friends Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and their daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) who is Annas best friend. Nothing remarkable really happens in these scenes but pay attention because the smallest moments or gestures help to establish the characters.At some point during the day Anna and Joy vanish. The police are called and suspicion immediately focuses on a mute and very creepy young guy named Alex (Paul Dano) who is driving a decaying RV that the girls played on earlier in the day. Advertisement The lead investigator an obsessive moody detective named Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests the creep but is convinced he is innocent. The increasingly desperate Keller is equally convinced that he is guilty as hell and knows where the girls are. Whether Alex is the kidnapper is part of the mystery to the very end.When the police release Alex for lack of evidence Keller goes ballistic. He snatches Alex off the streets takes him to an abandoned building and inflicts some serious very bloody pain. Keller has become a modern-day version of Charles Bronsons Paul Kersey in the ""Death Wish"" movies or Dustin Hoffmans David Sumner in Sam Peckinpahs ""Straw Dogs.""If you have seen the trailers for ""Prisoners"" you may have the impression that the wrath the vengeful Keller lays on Alex is the whole movie. But most of what I just described takes place in the first third of the piece. Its what happens afterward that is really important as everyone involved in the case starts to crumble Keller Alex Loki Grace the Birches even Alexs aunt (Melissa Leo) whose presence seems small at the beginning and looms large by the end.Under the skillful direction of Villeneuve working from an excellent script by Alex Guzikowski (""Contraband"") ""Prisoners"" is loaded with twists turns unexpected emotions and strong imagery that demands the audience pay attention but also rewards it for its efforts. He gets immeasurable help from the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins (""Skyfall"") whose work ensures that every scene has a visual punch.As he proved in such films as ""Incendies"" Villeneuve has a way with actors -- and he brings out the best in a skilled cast. Jackman may have done his best work ever as Keller scary in his rage but also conveying the emotional torture the man is going through. Gyllenhaal is almost as good as Loki and the supporting cast is never less than believable. Even small roles are fully realized (look for veteran actor Len Cariou of TVs ""Blue Bloods"" as a drunken priest who plays a key part in the mystery.)A few flaws keep ""Prisoners"" from being truly great. The film is long sometimes numbingly so. Characters that are beautifully drawn at the beginning simply fade away at the end. Some of the religious imagery that runs through the movie is a touch too obvious. And the ending will be divisive in a ""Sopranos"" finale kind of way.But even with those faults this is a powerful engrossing film that transcends the normal constraints of its genre and is worth your investment of both time and attention.

Prepare to be electrified When it comes to thrillers Prisoners is the must-see sensation of the year. Grisly gruesome and unnerving this first-time English-speaking feature by French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) about the harrowing circumstances surrounding the kidnapping of two 7-year-old girls is the most brilliant nail-biting police procedural I have seen since David Finchers 1995 film Seven. (And you can throw in the best highlights from Silence of the Lambs too.) With Hugh Jackman as a distraught blue-collar father driven to the brink of madness when his daughter disappears in broad daylight and Jake Gyllenhaal as the seedy detective whose pokey sleuthing leads to unimagined horrors you will be frozen to your seat with awe. Thanksgiving Day on a neat inviting street with green lawns and white two-story Colonial homes in a suburban neighborhood that seems a long way away from the violence you read about in newspapers (the story is set in Pennsylvania but the movie was filmed in Atlanta) two families of friends and neighbors are clearing away the pumpkin pie and settling down to watch the big game when Keller and Grace Dover (Mr. Jackman and Maria Bello) and their best friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) suddenly realize their daughters are not in the house. A frantic search for a van that was parked earlier that day in front of a vacant house leads to an emaciated mentally challenged man named Alex (another loopy role for the creepy Paul Dano) who lives with his aunt (the great Melissa Leo). When Detective Loki (Mr. Gyllenhaal) the cop assigned to the case lets the weird suspect go for lack of evidence panic sets in and Mr. Keller a hotheaded carpenter with a short fuse flies into an uncontrollable rage and turns vigilante taking Alex into his own lawless custody and applying a brand of torture that is hard to watch. Alex has the mind of a 10-year-old and the terrible things that happen to him in the locked closet of a derelict house begin to turn the audiences terror to sympathy. But this movie is just getting started and although the running time nearing three hours passes seamlessly the shocks build with an intensity that is nothing short of unbearable. The neighbors hold a candlelight vigil that leads to a priest with a corpse in his cellar. As you follow the cleverly attenuated minutiae of the investigation clue by clue your brain does double time putting the pieces together. Another wack job turns up the clothes the children wore at the time of their vanishing hidden in trunks filled with poisonous snakes. But where are the bodies? A man rushes a dying child to the hospital in a blinding snowstorm with blood pouring into one eye. A toy whistle. A knitted bunny rabbit. The suspense mounts. And the ending is pure terror. From the masterful script by Aaron Guzikowski to the stunningly muted cinematography in snowy grays and midnight blues by the great Roger Deakins its an artistic triumph from start to finish. None of the characters are saints including the troubled cop but the acting is magnificent. Mr. Gyllenhaals police officer is as conflicted as the frustrated citizens who get in his way. At last Mr. Jackman has a role that proves why he is one of our most accomplished stars. He can do anything and he finally gets to prove it in myriad ways without the ridiculous comic book mask of Wolverine. Mr. Howard Ms. Davis and Ms. Bello make every minute count as grieving parents who are willing to bend their principles to find justice outside the law. And Ms. Leo as the mysterious aunt who adds up to more than meets the eye eschews the usual campy pitfalls for a performance that is as haunting as it is austere. Exquisitely paced like currents on metal during an electric storm Prisoners is unique. Unlike most lurid crime dramas there is no link between the serial killer and the cops. You dont know who the fiend is until the last dark and mordant scene unfolds and even then theres one more hair-raising revelation that will leave you shaking. When it comes to thrillers this one is as good as it gets. Not for the squeamish but for anyone who loves movies its too exhilarating to miss.

Actually its just the severely solemn voice of Hugh Jackman glumly reciting a Christian prayer over the austere opening shot of this frequently engrossing yet ultimately ludicrous kidnapping thriller directed by Incendiess Denis Villeneuve. The man who shall forever be Wolverine plays Keller Dover (a screenwriting-software moniker if ever there was one) somber patriarch of a suburban Pennsylvania family whose peaceful Thanksgiving is shattered by tragedy. While he and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are visiting their neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) the youngest child of each clan goes missing. Theres a sizable clue (a mysterious RV was cruising the neighborhood just before the disappearances) and a detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)--no relation to the God of Thunders treacherous brother--is quickly assigned to the case. But Keller is less than satisfied with how the first days of the investigation go especially after Loki is forced to release low-IQ prime suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) for lack of evidence. From here things get really biblical and were not just talking about the Virgin Mary statue thats used for a semi-cheeky jump scare (one of the films few genuine laughs). Villeneuve and the great cinematographer Roger Deakins--once again proving he can lend a prestigious sheen to the silliest material--ensnare their ensemble in a funereal winter purgatory where driving rain blinding snow and mocking gray skies are a constant. The weather seems like a projection of these characters damaged souls as well as a divine taunt; if God is in the details hes one cold-blooded mofo to allow this much unchecked pain and suffering. All of the characters respond in kind Keller orchestrates a kidnapping of his own that sorely tests his moral barometer even as he committedly engages in torture tactics--beatings scaldings and the use of a bloodied Abu Ghraibian blackout hood--that invite explicit parallels to the War on Terror. Elsewhere Grace besmirches her pure name by self-medicating into near-catatonia while both Franklin and Nancy become semi-willing accomplices to Kellers self-righteous fury. (Davis gets another chance to indulge in one of those trembling tears-flowing snot-takes that shes been baiting Oscar voters with since 2008s Doubt.) Even Melissa Leo shows up as a kind of backwoods Shelley Winters--something that turns out to be much more fun in theory than it is in execution. What of Loki you might ask? As played by Gyllenhaal hes slightly more haggard kin to the actors green investigator in Zodiac (2007) and much more ineffectually realized. The character is clearly supposed to have gone through the ringer long before this noirish adventure what with his blinking-eye tic some semi-visible tattoos and a cursorily acknowledged backstory about time spent in foster care. But Lokis obsession with cracking the kidnapping case seems pro forma rather than impassioned; when he trashes his desk after hitting yet another dead end its hardly a bellow at the void--more an actorly hissy fit. The uniformly showy performances (Acting with a capital A) are what do in Prisoners more than anything. The film has several adeptly directed suspense scenes such as a nighttime foot chase that makes you gasp at every motion-triggered backyard light but for all the expertly realized atmosphere you never sense that any of the players is inhabiting a character. Instead they seem to be dispiritedly reading lines off of an internal teleprompter lending a mock-sense of gravity to a story whose increasingly risible signs and portents (from snakes in a box to a Lazarus-like cave that figures in a head-slappingly ""ambiguous"" finale) play like bloated insta-metaphors bolstering a dour mostly tension-free enterprise.

By David Denby Hugh Jackman plays the father of a missing child in Denis Villeneuves thriller.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios The images are gray rain-streaked and richly dank and always in super-sharp focus. ""Prisoners"" a sombrely impressive thriller in the style of ""Mystic River"" and ""Zodiac"" was shot by the British cinematographer Roger Deakins a master of bleakness (he also did ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men""). Dreariness has its own kind of poetry--it certainly colors the mood of this harrowing tale which is set in a Pennsylvania suburb. Its a seemingly normal quiet place where fervid religion and rage against God exist side by side; it also has a history of missing children. Written by an American Aaron Guzikowski and directed by a Canadian Denis Villeneuve ""Prisoners"" like ""Mystic River"" and ""Zodiac"" is a thriller that digs into the dark cellars of American paranoia and aggression. Two couples one African-American (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and one white (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) are celebrating Thanksgiving together when their two young daughters go outside to play and immediately vanish. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) the ace local police detective arrests a feebleminded apparently hapless young man (Paul Dano) as a suspect but releases him after a couple of days--he doesnt have enough evidence to hold him. Loki is both systematic and highly intuitive and Gyllenhaal looking haggard and eaten up inside projects decency and obsessiveness in equal measure--thats why he keeps getting cast as a cop in movies. But one of the fathers Keller Dover (Jackman) insists that Loki isnt doing enough and he rampages through town searching for the girls part anguished parent part vigilante part morally blind avenger. Most detective stories drive toward reassurance. In the beginning someone is missing or someone has been murdered; corruption festers under the prosperous surface of life; the time is out of joint. A detective uses his reason his specialized knowledge of how criminals think and gradually after many mistakes solves the crime exposes the corruption and pulls the pieces of our existence back into a satisfying whole. Life makes sense after all. But ""Prisoners"" like ""Mystic River"" breaks the genres conventions. Villeneuve has what I keep looking for in directors a charged sense of the way the world actually works. Dover similar to the Sean Penn character in ""Mystic River""--a man who loses his daughter and goes mad--falls into moral anarchy. His job in life he keeps saying is to protect his family. Hes morally right and also disastrously wrong. Jackman with a black Vandyke beard seems more backwoods than suburban here and hes frightening. For once he has something genuine to sink his claws into--the narrow ignorant righteousness of American macho at its most extreme. Dovers intervention gums up Lokis ordered way of doing things and the movie turns into among other things a rivalry between method and impulse with Loki unable to solve the crime and taunted by Dover falling into a deep rage of his own. ""Prisoners"" despite its gathering anxiety has some of the pleasures of ordinary thrillers. But Villeneuve who previously directed ""Incendies"" does volatile scenes without exaggeration; parts of the movie are exceedingly violent though the violence isnt ""fun""--it makes you wince. (Horror-film fans will not like this picture; some of it is actually horrifying.) Villeneuve throws us into a complicated skein of abductions going back years without losing the urgency of the present. ""Prisoners"" is a challenge you have to decide whos right and whos wrong at every turn and when its over ambiguity rather than the satisfactions of harmony reigns. Life stays out of joint. This movie suggests that its never really been any other way. The documentary ""Salinger"" can be safely recommended to people who know nothing about J. D. Salinger and to people who can never know too much about him. Those who read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" at fourteen and then feasted for decades on small scraps of information about the reclusive writer may relish a two-hour-and-nine-minute film that tells his story with the kind of emphasis and iteration that makes others--neither indifferent nor adulatory--squirm in irritation. ""Salinger"" is self-important redundant and interminable. The director Shane Salerno working with the critic David Shields (they have also produced a thick book based on their research) invests everything that Salinger did (or mostly didnt do) with a thundering significance that might be considered excessive for a film about Tolstoy. Some of this portentous data-mining approaches absurdity. The filmmakers interview the husband of a reporter Lacey Fosburgh who got a telephone call from Salinger. Its quite something that telephone call the husband re-creates the breathtaking excitement of it. When Salinger receives in 1941 a two-line note from this magazine rejecting one of his stories the note looms in closeup accompanied by anguished music on the soundtrack. At the end as an old man near death he is seen climbing into a car and a title proclaims ""These are the last recorded images of J. D. Salinger."" The movie is like a monstrous balloon that keeps re-inflating. If Salinger were around he would reach for a pin. In 1953 two years after the enormous success of ""Catcher"" Salinger a man easily aroused to embarrassment or derision retreated to Cornish New Hampshire and remained there until his death in 2010. In the nineteen-fifties and sixties he published a collection of his early short stories and compilations of longer works that appeared in The New Yorker including ""Franny"" and ""Zooey"" but his public inaccessibility quickly became for many an affront a provocation an outrage. Readers who felt that he had spoken to them directly in ""Catcher"" longed for a renewal of that intimacy. And the media demanded to know exactly what he desired them not to know what was he doing up there? Over the years hundreds of fans and young writers made the pilgrimage to Cornish and flung themselves against the wall of Salingers isolation. (One of them now a middle-aged man is interviewed at length in the movie. Salinger told him that he was a writer of fiction not a teacher or a seer. The fan remains disappointed.) Publications like Life Time and the Times sent photographers and reporters to linger in cold and scratchy woods or to wait for days across the street from the post office where Salinger picked up his mail for a glimpse of him. One such photographer is interviewed. He got the shot but its not clear whether we are meant to cheer his perseverance or wonder at the impudent foolishness of his task. Since the filmmakers are in effect on the same errand they may not know. ""Salinger"" might have been a portrait of the artists escape from the philistines were it not apparent to us well before the end that the filmmakers have become the most determined philistines of all. Salerno and Shields are in love with the celebrity-fame-exploitation racket that Salinger walked away from. They find old girlfriends who recite their dismaying experiences with the writer; they film literary lions--Gore Vidal Tom Wolfe--who seem to have no strong feeling about him except perhaps envy of his sales; they attend to famous actors who have less interesting things to say about ""Catcher"" than ordinary readers might. Salerno doesnt pull much out of these people so he relies with fetishistic attention on still shots of Salingers long melancholy face with its crest of thick dark hair its lips slightly twisted in saturnine amusement. But showing these photographs doesnt yield any extra meaning. Desperate Salerno indulges in dubious acts of documentary re-creation--repeated shots of a dark-haired fellow crashing through northern woods like an axe murderer in a shabby shocker. There is also an unfortunate sub-Brechtian spectacle in which a writer typing away in a pool of light sits before a large screen showing scenes of the Second World War and other events in Salingers life and (presumably) his unconscious. The filmmakers insist that Salinger dominated mid-century American literature--but in that claim they are merely pumping up the importance of their own project which took nine years to complete. How good was Salinger? Wilfrid Sheed said that ""even in his best work Salinger was a recognizable graduate of commercial writing not art writing a Billy Wilder not a Bresson."" He observed of ""Catcher"" that ""very few classics are that easy to read or that likable either."" But Sheed also recognized Salingers extraordinary skill and virtually everyone has acknowledged his unforgettable voice a comic and lyrical creation so fully expressive of distaste for the crass energies of our business civilization that many readers battling their own anxieties and revulsion never get it out of their heads; the voice with its go-ahead rhythms and its gentle sadness still works for them. The unhappiest thing about ""Salinger"" is that the filmmakers have attached themselves to everything about Salinger but his writing.

By David Edelstein Published Sep 15 2013 ShareThis (Photo Wilson Webb/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) The killing of a child in Denis Villeneuves 2010 Incendies is so nightmarish that I hesitate to recommend the film yet the act is true to a tribal culture perverted by what one character calls the merciless logic of reprisalsso true that I was sure the director wouldnt exploit peril to small children for easy shocks in his kidnapping drama Prisoners. But my faith has been shaken. Prisoners written by Aaron Guzikowski doesnt come on like another cheap kidnapping saga. It begins with the recitation of the Lords Prayer and is studded with Catholic iconography and the promise of resurrection. Its steeped in the higher gloomthe rain raineth every dayand the longing for a sign from above. Any sign. Christian hunter Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) discovers his 6-year-old daughter and her friend missing after Thanksgiving dinner. We dont know who took them or if theyve even been taken. But there was an RV parked on the block driven by one Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has whats described as a 10-year-olds intellect. Theres no physical evidencenot enough for Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to keep Alex locked up. But in a fracas following Alexs release he appears to whisper something to Dover that indicates he has seen the girls. So the hunter takes matters into his own righteous hands. This is the meat of Prisonersand I cant predict how anyone else will react to the scenes in which Dover imprisons and tortures the mulishly withholding simpleton. But I found them shockingly undisturbing. Its clear Alex knows more than hes saying and if it takes pounding his face in to find out what so be it. Dover sits on the floor and moans at the violence he has been forced to inflict while the father of the other girl (Terrence Howard) is stricken. Why? This is the old ticking-time-bomb scenario invoked by advocates of extreme interrogationand if you succeed in selling that (usually bogus) scenario theres not much of a moral dilemma at least in the context of a Hollywood thriller. Villeneuve is trying like hell to elevate what turns out to be a dumb genre picture. Viola Davis has a crazily nuanced scene when she regards the imprisoned man for the first time and that chameleon Melissa Leo provides a few frissons in creepy-neutral mode as Alexs aunt. But Prisoners is a long sentence. The detective moves in slow motion and you cant tell if its because the pacing and structure are faulty or if its the filmmakers way of making you think In the real world there is no instant gratification. But in the real world there wouldnt be a red herring as dumb as the one here. And its never clear whats eating Gyllenhaals Loki whos Gods Loneliest Manapart from Jackmans Dover.

Not unlike Argo last year ""Prisoners"" is a contemporary version of the kinds of movies made a few decades ago - this time serial-killer movies rather than political thrillers and from the 90s rather than the 70s. Directed with sober solemn earnestness by Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") it examines the emotional fallout of a child kidnapping on two families even as it chronicles the psychological unraveling of the investigating detective. Grim where its predecessors were spooky and barren where they were theatrical ""Prisoners"" is a movie whose execution and performances are admirable but its eventual concession to monologuing villains and life-or-death standoffs undermines the honest and substantive character work that precedes it. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover a God-fearing blue-collar contractor whose family dinner with neighbors Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) is interrupted when they discover that both of their youngest daughters have disappeared. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) promptly apprehends Alex Jones (Paul Dano) the driver of a dingy camper that was spotted in the area but he is forced to release the suspect when no evidence turns up. Nevertheless determined that the young man has the children tied up somewhere Dover kidnaps Jones and tries to torture him into confessing their whereabouts. But after Lokis investigation turns up another suspect Dover begins to question himself trying to figure out not just if he went too far in the name of rescuing his daughter but sealed her fate by pursuing the wrong man. Also read 20 Movies Were Dying to See This Fall At two and a half hours no moment is spared in Villeneuves chronicle of either the families pain or Lokis painstaking efforts - and thats mostly a good thing. Details about a dilapidated property Dover owns are revealed in naturalistic memorable but unobtrusive bursts of dialogue and the filmmaker never tips his hat too far when Loki notices clues that become relevant much much later. Its in this subdued and realistic portrait of events that Villeneuve succeeds most consistently because he gives us a sense not only of the chronology of events but convincing feelings of culpability hostility fear and resignation. Moreover even when Dover decides to take the law into his own hands theres a genuine reluctance an anguish that pervades even his cruelest explosions of violence. At the same time the film seems unable to reconcile its moral ambiguity and thoughtfulness with the rhythms of a more traditional cat-and-mouse thriller. Not that its possible any longer to create a truly evil kidnapper/killer/villain whose motives are equal to the mystery and sophistication of their crimes but Villeneuve supplies the audience with whale-sized red herrings en route to his final revelations. Although the film is smart enough to tie almost all of its suspects digressions and distractions together by the end of the film even cursory reflection upon what convergence of circumstances led to its conclusion becomes a dizzying array of singular character choices working in concert with one another in only the most improbable ways. Also read 5 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall Nevertheless two thirds of a remarkable portrait of causality - evaluating the choices we make and how they affect the world around us - Prisoners is precisely the solid sort of adult fare that signals the arrival of awards season. Though its likely too grim to follow further in the footsteps of four-square a winner like Argo the two share in common a sort of self-seriousness that tries to deceive the audience into believing its watching something deeply complex when its really just well-acted and ultimately very conventional crowd-pleaser.

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 7 2013 657 AM Share Tweet Share Tweet Theres no right or wrong way to attend a film festival but it seems fair to assert that any American who comes to TIFF to watch nothing but high-profile American movies is--to put it kindly--not getting their moneys worth. Then again sometimes a star-studded homegrown drama can be a nice festival palate cleanser especially when the rest of your day is spent grappling with smaller tougher more esoteric fare. The English-language debut of Denis Villeneuve who made the Oscar-nominated Incendies Prisoners (Grade B+) fits that bill nicely--though its not exactly a breezy genre distraction. Set in Pennsylvania during the investigation of a child-kidnapping case the film is conventional but almost nonstop gripping even after its plotting takes a turn for the slightly ludicrous. A sense of impending doom seeps into the opening shot in which an unsuspecting deer wanders into frame the camera pulling back slowly to reveal the teenage hunter--father by his side--moving the animal into the crosshairs of his riffle. As it turns out these two arent the only ones on the prowl. Hours later on the afternoon of a rainy Thanksgiving Day two grade-school girls disappear. One of them is the daughter of the man from the first scene a devout tough-love type played by Hugh Jackman seething with intensity. Maybe too much intensity actually Burying all traces of his Wolverine-worthy charisma the actor seems close to the edge from the start which makes his eventual descent into blinding bellowing rage less impactful. Better navigating a spectrum of emotions is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays the investigating officer--a local hotshot detective whos allegedly cracked every case hes been assigned. Gyllenhaal lends this archetypal character an amusing irritability; his exasperation is basically the lone source of levity in what turns out to be a pretty relentlessly grim thriller. Villeneuve crosscuts deftly between the efforts of his dueling protagonists men united in their aims but divided by their methods. The police eventually nab a suspect a mentally disabled man (Paul Dano) seen driving a suspicious van in the area but they dont have any evidence to keep him in custody. Consumed with paternal desperation Jackman takes matters into his own hands; the subsequent scenes are disturbing not just for the brutality of their violence but also for their allegorical power. (Jackman locks his silent captive in a cramped wooden box and slings a pillowcase over his head. Sound familiar?) Prisoners is concerned with the relationship between ends and means but not too deeply. Its predominately a crackerjack mystery yarn one that grows increasingly farfetched as it progresses but never quite loses its darkly magnetic pull. Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins who lends this ugly material a seductive sheen Villeneuve takes a heavy step into David Fincher territory There are shades of Zodiac in the gorgeous nighttime photography and obsessive procedure and of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in the implausible plotting. Prisoners also recalls the bleak crime dramas of Bong Jo-Hoon (Memories Of Murder Mother) though it could have used a little more of those films ambiguity. In any case the crowd I watched it with sat in awed tense silence throughout--a mighty good sign that a thriller is doing its job. I might have to make room in my schedule for Enemy another film directed by Villeneuve starring Gyllenhaal and showing at TIFF this year. A half hour after Prisoners let out I ducked into a late screening of a very different movie and experienced an almost polar-opposite reaction from the audience. MANAKAMANA (Grade B) a repetitive but sometimes beguiling documentary produced by the directors of Leviathan inspired waves of walk-outs. The impatience was somewhat understandable A Wavelength selection screening in the less avant-friendly environs of the Lightbox MANAKAMANA requires total submission to its conceptual methodology. Filmmakers Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez mounted cameras inside the cable cars that provide access to the eponymous temple in Nepal. The entire film is a series of medium shots of the commuters--a father and son college girls women eating ice cream--as they travel up or down the mountain the breathtaking terrain framed behind them. Though one T-shirt-clad teen insists that the round-trip takes 17 minutes travel time seems to vary. Are the subjects aware of the camera? Some seem to deliberately avoid its lens others may be performing for it. (And all but a few seem genuinely unsettled by the loud mechanical grinding that occurs occasionally during the trip.) Time most likely is manipulated; though the directors create the illusion of an unbroken single shot each landing of the cable car provides a cover of darkness in which they can cut. Here and there MANAKAMANA settles on a disarming moment a married couple plainly unable to disguise its discontent a lovely musical interlude even a zoological punchline. But the film overstays its welcome; one too many times does that cable car begin its ascent or descent to the point where the last few fades to black start to feel likes teases. Still I found it less tedious than Closed Curtain (Grade B-) the latest act of defiance from convicted Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi whos still under house arrest and still banned from making movies (though apparently his legal situation has somehow changed in ways the picture doesnt address.) Like This Is Not A Film Closed Curtain takes place almost entirely within the directors home. Unlike that film it has a kind of loose fictional plot in which a writer (Kambuzia Partovi the films co-director) spars with a house intruder who comes to represent surrender/suicide. That may sound livelier than the film that was not a film but without the meta trickery of its predecessor Closed Curtain just begins to feel like a lesser (though more handsomely shot) variation. Its nice to see Panahi keeping busy of course especially given that the main drive of this one is his fear of not being able to work anymore. But the finished product feels a bit like a restless throwaway a film he made of compulsion to just make something. Someone somehow get this man out of captivity and back into the streets like the heroines of his great joyful Offside. --A.A. Dowd One of the drawbacks of film festivals is that movies come in freighted with expectations about how theyll ""perform."" Every film is either a Best Picture contender or a catastrophe--and once a label has been applied thats the end of the discussion. Despite Twitters best efforts its not likely that 12 Years A Slave (Grade B+) conquered the Oscars--or racism in America--in the course of a single screening. That kind of reaction is a disservice to the film Steve McQueen has actually made which is not simply ""about slavery"" but another in the directors portraits of self-denial. Like the fasting Bobby Sands in Hunger (2008) and the repressed sex addict Michael Fassbender played in Shame (2011) Chiwetel Ejiofors Solomon Northup--a real-life Saratoga New York man kidnapped and sold into slavery on whose 1853 memoir the film is based--is forced into a situation where reticence is the only option. Even telling his new ""owners"" he can read and write would put him in grave danger of being killed. Theres a Kafka-esque relentlessness to his ordeal as he wakes up from his abduction and is beaten when he protests that hes a free man. He has no access to the law. Even when seemingly good men swear to help him their word proves to be worthless. 12 Years A Slave becomes a story of survival and to some extent martyrdom in the sense that staying alive requires acquiescing to an unjust system. Solomon becomes a favored slave to a plantation owner (Benedict Cumberbatch) he considers to be a decent man ""under the circumstances""--a stance that earns him accusations from fellow slaves of showing sympathy for the devil. After hes sold to Fassbenders volatile taskmaster the film escalates even further in its violence and horror. McQueens long takes accentuate the brutality as when Solomon is nearly lynched but then left noosed even after being spared or when hes forced to perform a whipping that Fassbender is ashamed to do. A crucial late scene finds the protagonist slowly joining in with the singing of a spiritual his conversion to slave life complete. Marred by a few distracting cameos and an overwrought Hans Zimmer score that at least on first listen sounds almost identical to the Shame score this is nevertheless a powerful vividly rendered film with a depiction of slavery thats less expansive but more stark than that seen in the Boschian atmospherics of Richard Fleischers Mandingo (1975) or Tarantinos movie-ized Django Unchained (2012). Ejiofor and Fassbender give intensely physical performances; the latter looking a little Van Gogh-like is terrifying even when he drapes his arm around Ejiofor who balances his co-star with an exquisite reserve. Its unquestionably a film to be seen and argued over--but dont call it Oscar bait. Its better than that. Yesterday I also overheard someone claim that Daniel Bruhl would receive a nomination for Ron Howards Rush (Grade B-) the kind of remark that again betrays a profound lack of self-consciousness. The movie chronicling the 1970s rivalry between Britains James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrias Niki Lauda (Bruhl) will likely appeal mainly to diehard Formula One fans though it does document a dynamic contrast in athletic styles. Hunt is the playboy who lives for danger and instinct. Lauda on the other hand is relentlessly methodical; in a major scene he says hes reluctant to race if conditions give him higher than a precisely 20 percent chance that hell be killed. Despite a clumsy intermittent voiceover from Peter Morgans screenplay Rush is basically a foursquare sports film enlivened by whiplash-inducing crisply edited racing sequences but otherwise pretty ordinary--certainly not on par with the more grandly scaled craftsmanship in Howards Cinderella Man. Howard isnt the only director here to be overshadowed by his past work. Kiyoshi ""no relation to Akira"" Kurosawa can be a first-rate horror filmmaker (1997s Cure) but his Real (Grade C) is an unsatisfying shamelessly derivative mix of elements from Inception Flatliners and Shutter Island. The movie starts promisingly as a man (Takeru Sato) makes a technology-abetted incursion into the mind of his comatose lover (Haruka Ayase) a manga artist who apparently attempted suicide after experiencing profound writers block. While the first half boasts some creepy images and the kind of pervading dread that marked both Cure and Kurosawas Pulse (2001) the further the film travels into its characters pasts the more it falls back on blunt Freudianism and risible metaphysics. Tims Vermeer (Grade B-) puts forth an intriguing idea that Vermeer in a secret method painted by using a camera obscura combined with a mirror as a guide. Its a technique anyone can use that essentially qualifies the artists paintings as proto-photographs. This Penn amp; Teller production (Teller takes directing credit; Penn appears as a talking head) follows San Antonio-based technologist Tim Jenison as he sets out to test his theory by painting his own version of a Vermeer using only tools the painter had at the time. Its a cool hypothesis catnip for art-history buffs but it cant quite sustain feature length. Lastly Im going to have plead ""grade pending"" on this years Locarno winner The Story Of My Death whose final 15 minutes I missed due to some last-minute schedule reshuffling. But on the basis of the two-hours-plus I saw Albert Serras imagined meeting of the minds between Casanova and Dracula--the latter doesnt appear until past the halfway mark--is as verbose and self-serious and as his biblical riff Birdsong (2008) and his Don Quixote story Honor Of The Knights (2006) were laconic and wry. --Ben Kenigsberg Share Tweet Filed Under More Toronto International Film Festival Previous Toronto International Film Festival Toronto 2013 Day One A Julian Assange biopic is no match for a Frederick Wiseman triumph Next Toronto International Film Festival Toronto 2013 Day Three Gravity drops Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr SEEING THE LIGHT Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a stirring performance as the rough and tumble Detective Loki in Prisoners (Wilson Webb) A Prisoners Genre Drama; Starring Paul Dano Jake Gyllenhaal Hugh Jackman Melissa Leo; Director Denis Villeneuve; Release Date Wide 09/20/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 146; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 6 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT In movies like Death Wish (1974) where Charles Bronson played a walking statue of stoic wrath vigilante justice is mean and nasty and it?s also good clean righteous fun. But then there?s the kind of movie like Sam Peckinpahs Straw Dogs (1971) that salutes lone-wolf vengeance and at the same time makes you feel the spiritual toll it takes -- a breed of thriller thats exciting cathartic and powerfully disturbing. Prisoners is that kind of movie. Its rooted in 40 years of Hollywood revenge films yet it also breaks audacious new ground. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover a brawny survivalist who is also a gentle-voiced suburban dad. On a rainy Thanksgiving afternoon Keller brings his wife (Maria Bello) and kids over to the home of neighborhood friends (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The two families eat drink and joke around and nothing too remarkable happens -- until everyone realizes that Keller?s little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) has left the house and disappeared along with the other family?s daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). A search turns up nothing but later that night the police find a pale mostly mute young creep (Paul Dano) in smudged aviator frames and oily long hair hanging around in his skeevy RV camper -- the same vehicle that the girls were trying to crawl up the ladder of that afternoon. The cops arrest this damaged-looking sad sack interrogate him and find no evidence. So they let him go. But Keller after an encounter with the suspect outside the police station is convinced that he?s guilty. So he takes action. He kidnaps the creep brings him to an abandoned apartment building and beats him to a bloody pulp over and over again. He threatens to kill the young man unless he confesses. But the suspect/victim says nothing. If he is in fact innocent then what Keller is doing is an unholy atrocity. But what if he?s guilty? Are Keller?s one-man torture-squad tactics justified then? And what if many people (along with the law) would declare that no those tactics are still not justified? What should Keller do given that every bone in his body is telling him that this is the only way he?ll ever see his daughter again? What if every bone in his body is right? Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) from a script by Aaron Guzikowski is no shallow payback thriller. It?s a dazzingly potent ambitious and complex movie a film that forces you to ask questions that have no easy answers. What I?ve described is merely the film?s first act. There are a great many twists and turns -- both suspenseful and thematic -- to come. Yet at the heart of Prisoners is something primitive and elemental and gripping an obsession with torture morality and the impotence of the justice system that speaks to our time as intensely (and maybe controversially) as the pitch-dark vigilante thrillers of the 70s once spoke to theirs. Jackman in a staggering performance thats unlike anything he has done before acts with an unbridled rage and he invests every snarl and rasp of that anger with meaning. Keller knows that in missing-child cases each day the victim doesnt turn up radically increases the chances that she never will and so his fury even at its craziest comes off as a desperate display of committed action. Haunted by what might be happening to his daughter he has -- at least in his own mind -- transcended the law yet that leaves him with nothing to believe in but himself and Jackman takes us on every step of that brave terrible journey. Each of the films major performances is powerful. As the cop heading up the investigation Jake Gyllenhaal has a moody badass danger that all but redefines him as an actor (for the first time he doesnt seem like too nice a guy) and Melissa Leo as the suspects mother unnerves you with the sinister banality of her homepsun Middle American quirkiness. Shes the nightmare mom next door. In its treatment of torture as a means to an end Prisoners is very much a post-Zero Dark Thirty movie even if the sin at its heart is child abduction rather than terrorism. Keller?s remorseless treatment of his suspect echoes America?s treatment of its captives at Abu Ghraib and other hidden locales after 9/11. Only this time it?s personal a desperate father out to save his daughter. Prisoners takes the mythic simplicity of the vigilante film and adds arresting layers of ambiguity. Watching the movie we behold Keller?s actions and feel that they may be horribly unjustified -- a daring place for a film to put its hero -- and we also behold his actions and feel that they may be what true morality demands. It?s a sign of the film?s power that either scenario could turn out to be true and that each one is just as scary.

""Be ready"" Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) advises his son as they return from a Thanksgiving morning deer hunt. His own father said the same to him and the God-fearing Keller has followed it to a T since. However all the emergency supplies in the basement fail to prepare Keller or wife Grace (Maria Bello) for the abduction of their daughter and the equally young daughter of Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) from somewhere between their respective homes in suburban Pennsylvania. The only lead left for Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to pursue is the nearby appearance of a shady RV driven by simple-minded local Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Without a lick of physical evidence Loki finds himself unable to hold Alex in custody and so a distraught Keller decides to take matters into his own hands. If youve already seen the trailers for ""Prisoners"" then you probably have a fair idea of where things go from here but you may not anticipate the precise control that both director Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") and writer Aaron Guzikowski (""Contraband"") bring to a potentially routine procedural. Few modern thrillers aim to engage an adult audience first and foremost and fewer still concern themselves with weighty moral dilemmas while unfolding their mysteries at a deliberate pace (the film runs nearly 150 minutes and hardly feels as such). Even if ""Prisoners"" doesnt pack quite the same punch as either Ben Afflecks great ""Gone Baby Gone"" or upcoming Israeli import ""Big Bad Wolves"" it certainly follows well enough in their bleak taut footsteps. The title of course harbors many interpretations the literally trapped girls and suspects Kellers inability to protect his kin Lokis frustration with a dead-end case (hes cracked every other one to date) the wives stricken by grief (a touch that all but sidelines Bello and Davis). All of this angst is complemented well by Johann Johannssons foreboding score and captured starkly by Roger Deakins cinematography itself casting a worthy winters chill over the proceedings as each character is pushed to physical and emotional extremes. Jackman and Gyllenhaal serve as two sides of the same coin with the former delivering a positively feral performance while the latter conveys the more oppressed frustrations of being hamstrung by due process and dwindling clues. Although Dano often seems to be serving up a variation on the same sniveling performance his work as Alex walks a fine line between a general guilelessness and more sinister gestures with his aunt (an aged-up Melissa Leo) serving as his sole defender. Villeneuve and Guzikowski arent necessarily immune to every crime-thriller convention the requisite red herring is immediately transparent while some breathless exposition in the second act is needed to thrust us into the home stretch. Still rarely a moment is ever wasted a consequence ignored and though the climax is a corker the final shot is even better. ""Prisoners"" requires and rewards your attention in equal measure. Be ready. SCORE 8.4 / 10 ""Prisoners"" will be released in theaters on September 20th.

Powered by an unusually rich twisty script by Aaron Guzikowski (""Contraband"") and career-best performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal this tale of two Pennsylvania families searching for their kidnapped daughters sustains an almost unbearable tension for two-and-a-half hours of screen time satisfying as both a high-end genre exercise and a searing adult drama of the sort Hollywood almost never makes anymore. Fully deserving of mention in the same breath as ""Seven"" ""Mystic River"" and ""In the Bedroom"" this Sept. 20 Warners release may prove too intense for some viewers but should ride strong reviews and word of mouth to above-average R-rated returns. It immediately enters the ring as an awards-season heavyweight.This story first appeared in the September 10 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Though at first glance the pic would appear to have little in common with his previous work Villeneuve has long shown an interest in the psychological and emotional consequences of violence as evidenced by 2009s serenely chilling black-and-white ""Polytechnique"" (about a real-life Canadian mass shooting) and especially 2010s Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"" which ""Prisoners"" echoes in its fragmented central mystery and its theme of the good and ill transmitted from parents to children. But in every respect the new film finds Villeneuve working on his biggest and most ambitious canvas to date and perhaps most impressive flawlessly catching the moods and mores of small-town God-fearing America. The movie announces its measured quietly confident tone right from the opening scene of a father-son deer-hunting trip the first of many images of predators pursuing their prey. ""Be ready"" says the father Pennsylvania carpenter Keller Dover (Jackman) to the teenage boy (Dylan Minnette) a crucifix dangling from the rear-view mirror a late autumn chill hanging in the air. Back at home where Kellers wife Grace (Maria Bello) and 6-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) safely await his return the basement is stocked with enough emergency provisions for a nuclear holocaust. (Among other thing ""Prisoners"" is very much a movie about what people have in their basements.) All the canned goods in the world however cannot shield the Dovers from what is about to happen next. Theirs is the kind of quaint suburban street where people walk over to the neighbors house for Thanksgiving dinner and feel relatively insulated from the worlds violent ills. Yet it is during just such a Thanksgiving that Anna wanders off unsupervised along with 7-year-old Joy the daughter of family friends Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis and Terrence Howard respectively). By dessert both have vanished without a trace. The only clue Earlier in the day the girls were seen playing around a camper van parked in front of a vacant house down the road the faint sound of a radio suggesting that someone was inside patiently watching. Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is spending his Thanksgiving alone flirting with the waitress in a lonely Chinese diner when he first responds to the case. In the best film-noir manner rain is sheeting down and the camera of the great d.p. Roger Deakins (who has shot the film in wintry blues and blacks with an expressionist edge) pushes in slowly from behind. Loki we are told has never failed to solve a case though this is at odds with the mans solemn demeanor his haunted gaze and the elaborate tattoos jutting out from his collar suggesting reserves of private rage. Compare this to the eager-beaver murder sleuth Gyllenhaal played in David Finchers ""Zodiac"" and the full breadth of his impressive range immediately comes into focus. The camper van is soon located along with its owner a gangly inarticulate man-child named Alex (played to creepy perfection by Paul Dano) who lives with his aunt (Melissa Leo) in the kind of run-down cluttered tract house where serial killers and other movie deviants tend to reside. But awareness of such familiar tropes -- and awareness of our awareness of them -- is one of ""Prisoners"" canny strengths. So it turns out that Alex is not the kidnapper -- or at least that theres no physical evidence tying him to the scene -- and the police are forced to let him go. Which is when Keller whos as sure as we are that Alex is guilty takes matters into his own hands abducting the suspect and chaining him up in an abandoned apartment building that belonged to his father. The movies tally of kidnappers now stands at two. And the puzzle of ""Prisoners"" has only just begun to assemble. Following a lead to the home of an elderly priest (Len Cariou) Loki discovers a rotting corpse in a hidden cellar. Then at exactly the one-hour mark another shifty young man appears on the scene triggering a whole new set of suspicions. All the while Alex sits in hock violently tortured and interrogated by Keller (who tells his wife hes off helping the police) in an effort to discern the girls whereabouts. With each successive revelation Guzikowskis brilliant script satisfies the necessary machinations while always flowing effortlessly from his vivid multi-dimensional characters. That delicate balance extends to Villeneuves direction which maintains a vise-like grip on the viewer without ever resorting to cheap shock effects or compromising the integrity of the human drama. Yet this is also a film that breathes that knows it has the audience in its palm and can take time out for the kind of incidental character-deepening scenes that usually end up on the cutting-room floor. In less assured hands a movie called ""Prisoners"" with a plot like this would be an invitation to disaster heavy on self-conscious allegory symbolism and moral debate. (Everyone dont you see is a prisoner of something -- of time of grief of his own psyche.) In Villeneuves nothing is belabored the thorny questions of right and wrong bubbling under the surface without ever being declaimed. Jackman has simply never been better than as this true believer forced to question his beliefs. Effortlessly the Australian actor projects a solid rugged Americanness the acme of a man whose home is his castle and who sees himself as his familys protector. It is a performance void of vanity or the desire to be loved by the audience and moment to moment it is exhilarating to watch. In just a handful of scenes each Bello and Davis suggest the full inexpressible weight of motherly grief. Leo given a role rife with opportunities to ham it up instead plays things with the sober conviction of a disappointed life another standout in a movie with nary a squandered performance in the mix. In addition to Deakins stellar work longtime Clint Eastwood editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach have done a formidable job of assembling the pics densely constructed narrative web. Score by Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson (also making his big-studio debut) strikes just the right haunting mournful notes. Film Review PrisonersReviewed at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank Calif.

Sandy says September 29 2013 at 807 am This movie is silly. Are we to believe that a twitchy detective with a history of solving all his cases is going to lose it and jump on a suspect in an interrogation room? Are we to believe that a serial killer leaves her front door unlocked? Are we to believe that a seasoned detective does not call for backup several times in a row? Are we to believe that this detective does not know to call for an ambulance for a sick child? Reply nick says September 27 2013 at 1149 pm I found this movie largely unsatisfying. Unless I have poor attention skills there were too many attempts to confuse the viewer but they were not connected in any meaningful way. The priest the strange guy who buys kids clothes and puts them with snakes. It seems misleading and convoluted just for the sake of filling time. By the end I felt little interest in the conclusion regardless of what happened. Also in a storyline thats been done far too many times the Prisoner wants to be deemed well written but there are far too many details and conflicts that are resolved by coincidence rather than well thought out writing. All that being said the film was well shot and the acting saved it. Jake and Hugh were very believable and I will continue to support any films that they do in the future. Reply Barbara says September 22 2013 at 1013 am Loved the movie but a little confused about a few details. How did the little black girl get away who was the prison guard that supposedly commit suicide that Jake was looking at did the priest get in trouble for the murder of the man in his basement why was the psycho guy parked in front of his house did he know that was his home? Reply JMR says September 21 2013 at 504 am This is BS... I never wrote comments but must warn the public of this over-rate disaster... I heard most people say ""its horrible""... It ended stupidly and without regard to the feelings of those viewing this disaster... DONT see it Reply Liz says September 15 2013 at 506 am Thank you for such a detailed review. I wasnt sure I was going to see this but now I definitely will. The description of how the girls went missing brings back some memories for me. My familys from a small town in Indiana. When I was 8 years old and my brother was 5 we were spending the 4th of July at my aunts house with my parents and the rest of our family. I was supposed to watch my brother. I got distracted he wandered off and no one could find him for several hours. My parents even called the police. Fortunately he was at the next door neighbors playing video games with their 5 year old son. I got a stern talking-to and my brother was told never to go off without telling someone again. Well he never really learned to do that but we never had a scare like that again thank God. I was too young to really appreciate how incredibly terrifying such times are for parents. Kids wander off. Its inevitable. No parent no matter how caring or vigilant can watch their children every minute of every day. All you can do is pray that when the inevitable does happen that it doesnt intersect with the unbearable. For those parents who that does happen to my heart just breaks.

Having established that the film is more than two-and-a-half hours (153 minutes)...with an apparent need to be ""heavy on self-conscious allegory symbolism and moral debate."" As a novel such depth would be expected; in a film with an audience conditioned (frankly willing) to give anywhere from 80 to 120 minutes of their life to watch a movie the length could be deadly. The story itself has been told many times before (nothing new under the sun and all that) but the way in which the narrative is rendered makes all the difference. But the time ones butt is in the seat...PRISONER suggests a flick best enjoyed in ones home theater (re VOD same day in theaters). How ""good"" can any film be relies upon the eye of the beholder; how long a film runs is something everyone can agree upon. Reply Nicole says August 31 2013 at 741 pm Denis Villeneuve is one of the best young filmmakers in Canada today. Both his pervious efforts have been sensational. Polytechnique especially is searing and captures an event that still looms large in our Canadian consciousness. Both of his previous efforts were engaged on the subject of violence how it is used why and to what end its impact. I wonder how it will be employed here. Glad to hear his English debut is so promising. The cast looks truly phenomenal I have no doubt they will deliver. I feel like this film will be a challenge to sit through due to its subject matter like his previous efforts. He does not shy away from making challenging films. Reply Clint says August 31 2013 at 718 pm Gyllenhaal deserves a nomination a sort of compensation for having snubbed his amazing performance in the brilliant EOW last year Reply Roger T says August 31 2013 at 501 pm My predictions acting nominations for Hugh Jackman (Lead) Melissa Leo (Supporting) and possibly Jake Gyllenhaal if he goes Supporting-Best Actor just looks super competitive this year. Also possible nominations for the director screenplay and Best Picture. Reply Clare Munn says August 31 2013 at 936 am As someone who got scared in Shrek it was clearly apparent to me watching the screening without bolting and being absolutely riveted that this was a slice of genius. It is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to director Denis Villeneuve; actors Maria Bello Viola Davis Terrance Howard Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal et al not to mention the very talented crew DP etc. The editing is also flawless and music is perfection. I believe the psychological question it brings up about family and the lengths one goes to protect is an honest and timely one. Reply David says August 30 2013 at 752 pm Gyllenhaal is increasingly good Impressed Reply harry georgatos says August 30 2013 at 734 pm INCENDIES is a masterpiece. PRISONERS has a lot going from directord.p and its writers. Reply kenmandu says August 30 2013 at 704 pm Mystic River In the Bedroom - very very over-rated.

TWITTER Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal lead an all-star cast in Canadian director Denis Villeneuves thriller about the search for two abducted children. Can a superbly crafted film overcome audience resistance to an extremely painful subject? That is a question that Warner Bros. will be pondering nervously as Prisoners moves from its festival screenings during the next week to a wide national release later in September. The movie deals with the abduction of two young children and the havoc that this trauma wreaks on the families and police officers investigating the crime. While the subject has been in the news recently giving the film undeniable timeliness theres a difference between following a disturbing news story and paying to see a similar drama unfold at the multiplex. In addition the film doesnt flinch from graphic moments of violence and terror. PHOTOS Telluride Film Festival The Films Canadian director Denis Villeneuve makes his Hollywood debut with this film. His previous film the Oscar-nominated foreign-language film Incendies did attract an audience even though it dealt with rape incest and religious hatred. Still that was essentially an art house success that may not be a relevant point of comparison for a wider major studio release. Leaving aside the movies uncertain commercial prospects this much is certain Viewers who see the movie will find it absolutely riveting and this is a tribute to the filmmakers skill and to the excellent cast that brings the story to life. The film begins indirectly but ominously as a man encourages his teenage son to hunt and kill a deer. The father Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a carpenter who seems to be one of those survivalists who clings to guns and religion but our view of him as a right-wing nutcase is modified when we see that he and his family choose to spend Thanksgiving with a black family in the neighborhood. (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the neighbors.) The friendship of these two families is surprising but handled naturally and believably. As everyone relaxes during the course of a long afternoon their two young daughters go outside and never return. A suspicious looking van was spotted outside and the parents begin to fear the worst as they contact the police and a search for the two girls builds in intensity. The police arrest the driver of the van Alex (Paul Dano) who turns out to be mentally impaired but they have insufficient evidence to keep him in custody. Frustrated Keller decides to abduct Alex and interrogate him brutally convinced that this is the only way to save the two girls while the clock is ticking. The film makes pertinent provocative comments on vigilante justice and the issues are never simplified in Aaron Guzikowskis screenplay. Keller is fanatical but we sense that he may have legitimate reasons for his suspicion of Alex. When he gets the neighboring couple involved in his torture plan they are initially appalled but hesitant to stop him because they too sense that this may be the only way to save the children. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies Enders Game Catching Fire The Wolf of Wall Street amp; More As Kellers interrogation continues in scenes that are gruesome but never exploitative Villeneuve frequently cuts away to follow the lead police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is pursuing his own investigation that includes questioning Alexs lonely aunt (Melissa Leo) whose troubled family history may have led her nephew astray.  As the film weaves all the plot and character strands together the vise tightens. There are some truly scary scenes as new suspects appear and the film twists its way to a dark mordant conclusion. Its worth remembering that Incendies despite its Oscar nomination and excellent reviews was essentially a high-class melodrama and thats the way that Prisoners should be viewed as well. And thanks to the efforts of an expert filmmaking team its a smashingly effective melodrama. Villeneuve enlisted brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins who captures the rainy chilly atmosphere of this Pennsylvania community with visual eloquence. (Pennsylvania was convincingly recreated outside Atlanta.) The editing by Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach editors of many of Clint Eastwoods recent movies is also first rate. Although the film runs two and a half hours there doesnt seem to be a wasted frame. PHOTOS Hugh Jackman An Unconventional Superstar The performances also enrich the film. Jackman gives what may be the most intense and satisfying performance of his career. As the film progresses we learn that Keller is a far more complex and tormented character than his first appearance as macho hunter suggested. A recovering alcoholic and less than perfect husband he seems to be acting out these vigilante fantasies as a way of compensating for a deep-seated sense of inadequacy. Jackman illuminates the characters conflicted nature without ever begging for sympathy. Gyllenhaal is also playing a troubled character a suspicious loner who nonetheless has a strong desire to help people in need and he wins our sympathy for this dogged detective without in any way idealizing the character. Howard and Davis are excellent as always though one flaw of the film is that they have too little to do in the second half of the story. As the plot twists multiply and tension mounts the film reaches a climax that is satisfying without being predictable. Special praise should go to the sound engineer for a shrewd touch in the very last scene that brings the story to an absolutely perfect conclusion. Prisoners can at times be a hard film to watch but thanks to all the talent involved its even harder to shake off.

Similar to Villeneuves Oscar-nominated ""Incendies"" the directors first entirely English language feature involves a high stakes investigation and a generation-sprawling mystery only made fully clear in its closing scenes but the comparisons stop there. Before all else Villneuves grim chronicle of the fallout when two young girls vanish in a small town succeeds at crafting one powerfully suspenseful moment after another. Closest in terms of precedents to the patiently told crime sagas of David Fincher with shades of ""Se7en"" and explicit nods to ""Zodiac"" ""Prisoners"" alternates between two modes an investigative thriller and a intense tale of crime and punishment. From the opening shot its obvious that the movie intends to tackle big ideas as Villeneuves camera gradually pulls back from a deer in the snow to find it in the crosshairs of a teen hunter while his stern-faced father Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) recites a prayer. The mixture of tension and spiritual convictions that come out of that sequence remain in place over the course of the next two-and-half hours picking up steam moments later. After father and son bring home the buck they share the meal with Kellers close friend and neighbor Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his brood as holiday cheer sets in. Within minutes the tenor of the scene shifts as the two families young daughters vanish without a trace and panic sets in. Nearby wry detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) tracks down a mobile home spotted near the neighborhood and arrests simpleton Alex Jones (Paul Dano) an obvious suspect who offers no clues to the girls whereabouts. Having reached this juncture ""Prisoners"" branches off in two directions The continuing efforts by Loki to track down the reason behind the girls disappearance by grasping for shreds of local events stretching back several decades and the alarmingly risky antics of Keller as he decides to take matters into his own hands. Frustrated with the polices inability to press charges against Danos soft-spoken headcase Keller kidnaps the young man and tortures him in a vacant building for days at a time vainly performing a series of brutal acts to pry out new information. Revealing the scheme to the similarly bereaved Keller and his wife (Viola Davis) Keller drags the Birch family into his dangerous vigilante world while keeping his own brood in the dark further complicating their ability to cope with the difficult scenario. As a result of this uneasy dynamic there are several layers knowledge circulating throughout the thorny plot. ""Prisoners"" retains a constant level of engagement by making it impossible to determine who will discover the next piece of the puzzle and whether a moral boundary has been crossed. While Gyllenhaals character grows suspicious of Kellers behavior both men seem to be walking circles around the bigger picture behind the original crime. Though their commitments resonate they hail from familiar archetypes Loki is the obsessive cop slowly driven to maniacal extremes by his interest in an impenetrable case while Keller takes on the dimensions of a typically flawed power freak when he starts hitting the bottle to bury his sorrows. Yet theres no doubting the power of Aaron Guzikowskis script in rendering the mens plights with a series of engrossing turns. Unsurprisingly ""Prisoners"" refers not only to the pair of presumed young captives but to the way everyone impacted by their absence is trapped by emotion and instinct. Its certainly difficult to empathize with Keller once he starts subjecting his own detainee to severe measures threatening him with a hammer and hot water to no avail. ""Hes not a person anymore"" he claims to his horrified friend inadvertently establishing the possibility that the description could fit Keller just as well. Villneuve does a fine job establishing these alternating incidents although the rest of the cast is noticeably less rounded a sore point particularly in relation to the underwritten female characters Maria Bello as Jackmans melancholic wife does little more than wander around her house and weep while Davis gets only one scene to show much of a personality. By contrast Melissa Leo stands out with a substantially intriguing role as the mother to Danos enigmatic character with her significance in the story expanding in definition as the plot moves along though shes also a somewhat distracting cartoonish archetype of white trash that leads ""Prisoners"" in a pulpy direction thats beneath its grand gestures. Nevertheless its easy to make peace with some of the obvious genre tropes and simply admire the precision with which Villneuve keeps the pace in constant forward motion. As with Finchers ""Zodiac"" the nature of the search for answers takes on an almost metaphysical quality divorced from specifics. Of course the movie also contains a literal connection to Finchers movie in form of Gyllenhaal who does some of finest most controlled work since his similar role there. Jackmans equally in top form channeling the rage that made him such a fine Wolverine into a concerned parent driven to irrational outbursts. The specifics of the investigation cant compete with the maturity of the storytelling and when various pieces start to come together in the final hour the movies dramatic contrivances grow somewhat distractingly obvious. However Villeneuve finds steady footing in finale when the pileup of circumstances give way to a subtler ambiguous conclusion. Villeneuve makes the philosophical conundrums lurking beneath the proceedings feel purposeful. ""You cant always save the day"" a minor character argues to the resolute detective. With a perceptive eye ""Prisoners"" showcases the struggle to push back against that sentiment without taking sides. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Warner Bros. releases ""Prisoners"" on September 20. Well-received at Telluride the movie should gain some awards season momentum for its lead performances and screenplay although the dark subject matter make it a tough box office proposition.
