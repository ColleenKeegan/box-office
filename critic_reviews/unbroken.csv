Not as he races around the track during the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin not through the ear-shattering airborne gun fight not after his bomber is shot down into the Pacific not after endless beatings and long stretches of starvation in Japanese prisoner of war camps.And given the films title you dont really expect him to.But a truly extraordinary life alone doesnt necessarily make for an extraordinary film--or even a good one. Even if the audience walks away in awe of Zamperinis story as I did Unbroken falls short of the epic war drama and sweeping testament-to-the-human-spirit it strives to be. Zamperini who passed away in July at age 97 inspired the 2010 book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand the subtitle of which became the films somewhat heavy-handed tagline ""Survival. Resilience. Redemption.""Unbroken falls short of the epic war drama and sweeping testament-to-the-human-spirit it strives to beTo make Unbroken director Angelina Jolie got some help from Joel and Ethan Coen who adapted the screenplay (theres virtually zero imprint of their style on this film which did not boast the most impressive dialogue). During the making of the film Jolie became quite close to Zamperini eventually coming to see him as a ""father figure"" and one of her ""best friends."" Her take on his life was that despite being so ""average"" he survived--a sure sign of hope for a world filled with human suffering.This is where the trouble begins The film doesnt exactly portray Zamperini played by the superb Jack OConnell as average. Yes he has humble beginnings--born of Italian immigrant parents a target for bullies prone to trouble making  that are elucidated speedily through some well-placed flashbacks. But hes also clearly exceptional fearless and superhuman in his ability to transcend pain even torture. OConnell endures tragedy after tragedy with a certain steeliness jaw muscle clenched his gaze frequently unflinching. Hes also tender and selfless whether hes taking beatings aimed at other inmates or mesmerizing his fellow soldiers with stories of his mothers Italian cooking when theyre stranded for 47 days in the middle of the ocean.OConnell inhabits Zamperini or ""Louie"" with surprising and admirable commitment giving his character plenty of grit and in moments far too few a hint of mischievousness. One cant help but feel horror during the boat scenes when OConnell and his crew mates played by the memorable Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock turn increasingly skeletal with sunken cheekbones jutting ribs cracked lips sunburnt skin and dazed eyes. That feeling of horror which returns again and again thanks to the films jarring realism has little payoff when it comes to story and character. OConnell is phenomenal as Zamperini but the screenplay prefers to stun the audience with images of paralyzing bleakness rather than digging past the surface of Zamperinis persistence.Theres a delicate alchemy to the prestige formula of making the audience feel-good-via-feeling-bad.Unbroken was not destined to feel this empty. It contained several promising threads that would have fleshed out the story were they given more attention-- a brief glimpse into the Japanese propaganda machine; the existential weariness of being a prisoner of war (As one inmate tells Louie ""If we [the Allies] win were dead""); the twisted psychology of ""the Bird"" the Japanese corporal (played by Miyavi) who preyed on Louie.Theres a delicate alchemy to the prestige formula of making the audience feel-good-via-feeling-bad. But the films plain intention of celebrating triumph in the face of unthinkable hardship translates into 137 minutes during which the audience is forced to watch Zamperini swallow countless injustices of the body and mind. And at the films end comes swelling credits-music that seems to say ""Dont worry everything turned out alright"" complete with an epilogue and footage of Zamperini running a leg of the Olympic torch relay in Japan. This disjunction however well-meant feels at best tone-deaf at worst exploitative.Unfortunately the film doesnt work without that epilogue that reassuring pat-on-the-back that indicates all the suffering Zamperini went through (and that we the audience witnessed) was for something. The two hours or so that preceded these last scenes offer no such hope as if the film were touting endurance-for-the-sake-of-endurance. With this narrative failing the film inadvertently makes a sad point War is meaningful only as a monstrous collective effort; at the individual level theres often nothing to make sense of. In other words theres no inherent meaning in adversity. Its a fine if depressing statement but certainly not the one the film wanted to make.The real story the one told more fully in Hillenbrands book continues well after Zamperini returns home to his family at the end of the war. That story involves years of intense post-traumatic stress and alcoholism immediately following his return home and later a turn to Christianity and inspirational speaking. One of the major themes of his talks? Forgiveness or the last of that trio of values ""Survival. Resilience. Redemption."" Viewers will see plenty of the first two--Zamperinis will to live his imperviousness. Im left wondering how much more powerful and true the story could have been had Unbroken focused as much on the third.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

It easily could have been. This tale of wartime adventure and survival adapted from Laura Hillenbrands nonfiction bestseller definitely called for a big-name Hollywood director but it would have been highly plausible - maybe more plausible - as a project for Ron Howard or Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood than as the second film for the star-turned-director best known as the female half of the worlds most famous celebrity couple. Would it be getting less attention if one of those guys had made it or more respect? Both perhaps? How is our perception of the film being shaped by the unique fame and unique cultural status of its director and by our desire to project meanings onto her unusual career transition?I totally understand and share the longing to believe that Jolie can step behind the camera and compete with the big dogs in a nearly all-male field at a level where making a movie is a lot more like running a small company than like painting a picture. Lets be clear about this She can. ""Unbroken"" is a rousing old-fashioned yarn with numerous exciting set-pieces and an uncomplicated hero you root for all the way through. Its entertaining throughout and made with a high level of technical skill. If made 40 years ago it would have been a leading Oscar contender and a huge hit whereas today its a bit ""meh"" in both categories It will likely get several Oscar nominations but wont win anything big and it might have trouble attracting eyeballs in the overcrowded holiday season.We can say the gender of a filmmaker doesnt matter or shouldnt matter but we arent even close to that place yet. There are still almost no women among A-list Hollywood directors; even Kathryn Bigelow makes her films relatively cheap with independent financing. Ava DuVernay whose civil-rights drama ""Selma"" also comes out this week may be the next one. If any female movie star of anywhere near Jolies prominence has gone on to direct major films ... well no one has and theres no clear parallel. Yes Ida Lupino and Lillian Gish both made films which are largely forgotten today and there are a few examples one could draw from European cinema. The point stands. [CORRECTION I originally wrote that Lupino had directed only one movie which was entirely wrong. She made seven low- to mid-budget features and a bunch of TV episodes but never anything close to the production level of ""Unbroken.""]The aura of specialness around ""Unbroken"" has provoked various unhelpful reactions that have little to do with the film itself. On one hand there is boosterism and solidarity An awesome breakthrough for women On the other theres sneering condescension Not bad for a privileged girl working with play money. A fairer way of framing Jolies blow for gender equality is to say that she has succeeded admirably in making an old-fashioned adventure movie just as capable and unmemorable as if one of those old dudes I mentioned above had made it. Indeed Clint Eastwood with whom Jolie worked in ""Changeling"" is pretty much the obvious career model and ""Unbroken"" is almost exactly like one of the proficient and pointless middlebrow dramas Eastwood has been making since he quit acting.According to some reports the story of real-life World War II hero Louis Zamperini played by fast-rising British star Jack OConnell in ""Unbroken"" was considered possible fodder for a Hollywood feature as long ago as the late 1950s. Indeed it might have fit better in that era than in this one considering that Zamperinis saga is like a one-man display of How America Won the War. A kid from Southern California whose Italian immigrant parents spoke no English Zamperini emerged from teenage delinquency to compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics (the same games in which Jesse Owens won several gold medals) as a long-distance runner. In the war Zamperini survived a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean spent more than six weeks adrift in a lifeboat and endured several years in an especially brutal series of Japanese POW camps. You Might Also Like How to understand Zamperinis stranger-than-fiction true story either in life or in the movies is open to debate. We could say that some people find reserves of courage and strength within themselves that most of us dont possess (and will never have to search for) and leave it at that. Theres no moral to be found there necessarily Zamperini was young and strong and lucky and outlasted circumstances in which thousands upon thousands of other strong young men died. If his story appealed to Hollywood filmmakers first of all because its a rip-roaring adventure that keeps shifting from one episode to the next like an Indiana Jones movie there was also another reason. It can be described in platitudinous terms as being about the resilience of the human spirit while none-too-subtly making the point that human spirit runs just that little bit stronger in Americans than other people.Its almost surprising that a version of ""Unbroken"" wasnt made around 1959 with Tony Curtis playing Zamperini and someone like Stanley Kramer directing the film. But it didnt happen and the whole story receded into history for many years. Zamperini attended the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan meeting with some of his captors from the POW years. That brought his story back into the media spotlight and eventually Hillenbrand the author of ""Seabiscuit"" figured out that Zamperini was still alive and wrote a best-selling account of his adventures which in turn became a hot Hollywood property. (Zamperini died last July at age 97 but not before he had seen an early cut of Jolies film.) As a movie ""Unbroken"" is entertaining enough but feels a bit like an afterthought. It has terrific cinematography by Roger Deakins and a long-in-development script whose credited writers include Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese (""Beloved"") and William Nicholson (""Gladiator""). It has airplanes and sharks and roaring crowds above swastika banners and a sadistic Japanese soldier (the notorious Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe a real-life war criminal) played with lubricious zeal by Japanese rock star Miyavi. Some people have claimed to raise various political objections to the movie but I cant get interested to that degree. My problem is that ""Unbroken"" melts into every other POW movie and every other lifeboat movie that Ive ever seen. A week after seeing it Im not sure whether Im remembering ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" or ""Life of Pi."" OConnell is meant to make a vigorous impression but just comes off as another square-jawed pseudo-Nietzschean hero. Im pretty sure Ive gotten him mixed up with Hugh Jackman in ""The Wolverine"" which is more worth watching in any case. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Unbroken Video Rated PG-13  137 minutes  2014 Angelina Jolie directed this World War II movie from a script by Joel and Ethan Coen but none of them leaves any sort of signature on the result a straightforward and entirely commendable story about the triumph of the human spirit etc. Based on the best-selling nonfiction book by Laura Hillebrand it tells the story of Italian-American athlete Louis Zamperini who competed in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and later served in the U.S. Air Force as a bombardier against the Japanese. Shot down in May 1943 he and another crewmate survived on the water for 47 days (a third man died) before they were captured and interned in a series of hellish POW camps where Zamperini (Jack OConnell) became a favorite whipping boy of Sergeant Mutsuhiro ""the Bird"" Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) later named as a high-ranking war criminal.

"Review Unbroken is brutal and only part of the story - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Unbroken is brutal and only part of the storyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 12/23/2014 113821 AM PSTUpdated 12/23/2014 015816 PM PST Related StoriesDec 24Angelina Jolie found Louis Zamperini of Unbroken inspiringLafayette A friendship Unbroken""Unbroken"" is an honorable gorgeously shot venture from talented actress-turned-filmmaker Angelina Jolie. Given its subject it should have been great but it turns out to be simply good.The Christmas release is indeed powerful and moving. The story of the late Louis Zamperinis life is a towering testament to the resiliency of the human spirit and the healing power of faith and forgiveness. The films flaw is that it covers only part of this heroic and inspiring life. Laura Hillenbrands 2011 biography ""Unbroken"" presents a full portrait of the Olympic track star who survived the brutalities of World War II in Japanese prison camps. The physical and internal wars that Zamperini who died in July at age 97 confronted and overcame inspired countless readers whove kept ""Unbroken"" on various best-seller lists for years.Jolie was among those readers moved by his story. And theres no doubt that in her sophomore turn in the directors chair her heart and soul are in the right place. But the movie which shes so painstakingly brought to the screen with visual splendor and technical polish spends too much time during Zamperinis war years and not enough before and after. While the events the film details obviously are primary elements in this story of survival -- the 47 days he spent drifting on a raft in the Pacific Ocean after his plane is shot down and the torture he endured at the hands of a sadistic prison guard -- theyre only part of his story. Advertisement British actor Jack OConnell who won raves in the British prison drama ""Starred Up"" earlier this year clearly is able to handle weighty material. He throws himself into the role and fully taps into Zamperinis indomitable will to survive. Its a physically demanding part -- he lost more than 25 pounds to demonstrate Zamperinis malnourished gauntness while in the POW camps -- and he excels. So do Domhnall Gleeson as Russell Allen ""Phil"" Phillips his crewmate and POW survivor and Garrett Hedlund as Cmdr. John Fitzgerald a fellow POW survivor who is moved by Zamperinis resolve to do the right thing at his own expense. Unfortunately theyre not allowed to do much more than weather harrowing situations due to a surprisingly traditional script written by a number of pros -- Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. That said Jolie has created some stunning action pieces from an aerial dogfight in the opening sequence to the days spent on the raft. Once hes captured by the Japanese the film falters and the audience is put through the wringer with the cruel and humiliating treatment that Zamperini suffers at the hands of prison guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe.Played by musician Miyavi (in an effective performance) Watanabe singles out Zamperini resulting in an odd power play. The relationship between guard and captive reaches a dramatic climax that is filled with raw emotion evoking the religious imagery of the crucifixion. It is the strongest and best scene in the film. Its too bad that much of the rest of the film feels like an endurance test. Yes some of those scenes are vital but with so many the result is numbing. Moreover the amount of time the film spends here is at the expense of other facets of Zamperinis life. The screenplay sprints too quickly through the Torrance natives early years from his track life to his appearance at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. And what happens after the war -- Zamperinis battle with post-traumatic stress disorder the grace he discovered in his Christian faith and his remarkable forgiveness of his tormentors -- are summed up in an epilogue. Only part of this redemption stori is told.While ""Unbroken"" has its issues Zamperinis story is not one of them. But you leave the theater wanting to know more about how this man escaped the shackles of darkness and turned his despair into forgiveness. For that we will need to turn to the book.unbroken   1/2Rating PG-13 (for war violence including intense sequences of brutality and for brief language)Cast Jack OConnell Domhnall Gleeson MiyaviDirector Angelina JolieRunning time 2 hours 17 minutes In this image released by Universal Pictures Jack OConnell portrays Olympian and war hero Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini in a scene from ""Unbroken.""

This is a rousingambitious beautifully executed and acted movie that actually moves you and touches you. Of course in this indifferent and detached age this is forbidden. The fact that theres the strong influence of religious faith in the story is also enough to condemn it in todays Hollywood. J. OToolesaid on Sunday January 11 2015 43153 AMYour critique is one note itself. This movie was moving and captivating capturing the brutality of war. Despite your unduly harsh comments this is what war was like and captures the essence of the book quite well. The reason you are only a critic is that you would not be able to create such an emotionally riveting movie yourself. Patrick Yaegersaid on Thursday January 01 2015 90252 PMMr. Roepers review strongest complaint about the film is that there are too many sadistic scenes and explains that this has the consequence of numbing the movie goer. He gives the film a C+. I am shaking my head in exasperation. What story did Mr. Roeper imagine was being told when he sat down to view the film? Two years of intense suffering and brutality were reduced to about 90 minutes of film adaptation. Nevertheless the spirit of Louis Zamperini remained unbroken and transcended his ordeal later in life. This was conveyed magnificently and thoroughly by the creative team behind the film including Director Jolie. I can only wonder what more Mr. Roeper needed from this story and the storytellers. I would think the power of the unimaginable and awesome events revealed to us and the obvious care and attention paid to each element of the story by the film makers would have allowed him to give Unbroken nothing less than an A. His critiques of this film adaptation of a book that bore witness to incredible events and people seem rather silly and ridiculous in my opinion when one considers the profundity of what was achieved by Louis Zamperini Laura Hilenbrand and Angelina Jolie.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 204 p.m. MST December 23 2014Angelina Jolies film tells the story of Louis Zamperini (Jack OConnell) an Olympian who survives 47 days adrift in the Pacific only to spend three years in a Japanese prison camp. Good but safe.Jack OConnell (right) plays Olympian and war hero Louis Zamperini in ""Unbroken.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story Highlights3.5 stars (out of 5)Zamperinis tale of suffering and sacrifice is nearly unbelievable.Jolie is a more-than-capable director but she doesnt take enough chances here.Joel and Ethan Coen are among the five screenwriters; that too makes the safe choices surprising.In ""Unbroken"" Angelina Jolie tells the heroic nearly unbelievable story of Louis Zamperini a former Olympic runner who survived 47 days in a life raft during World War II only to be captured by the Japanese and tortured in a prisoner-of-war camp for three years.It is a harrowing journey and an inspirational one. But as director Jolie takes far too long to tell it particularly in such a conventional manner.Jack OConnell plays Zamperini. OConnell is an outstanding actor as he showed playing a violent prisoner in the terrific ""Starred Up."" Hes good here but hes not asked to do much more than suffer nobly. And do it a lot.Jolie hits the ground running with Zamperini in a bomber taking fire. Hes calm under pressure and maybe a little bit lucky. We bounce back and forth from the action to Zamperinis childhood. An Italian immigrant hes often in trouble and starts running by accident -- hes always trying to elude trouble. (Run faster his brother tells him while theyre training. Louis wonders why. No one is chasing me.)Hes good enough to set the national high-school record in the mile and makes the 1936 Olympic team failing to medal in the 5000 meters but setting a record for his final lap.We go back and forth between the past and present for a time until Jolie jettisons the technique putting us in the plane that would malfunction and crash in the Pacific. Eight of the 11 men died in the crash; Zamperini along with Mac McNamara (Finn Wittrock) and Phil Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) survive but are stranded in a life raft surrounded by sharks starving desperate.This torment segues to capture by the Japanese. Zamperinis status as an Olympian becomes known and hes singled out for torture by the sadistic guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (the Japanese pop star Miyavi). Its here that the film begins to slow then drag. Jolie makes the time in the raft exciting and dangerous. The time spent in prison camps develops a sameness Watanabe known as ""the Bird"" talks of the possibility of friendship with Zamperini before beating him or having the entire camp line up to punch him in the face.Joel and Ethan Coen are among the five credited screenwriters. Given that and Jolies on-screen presence its surprising that the movie after its strong start shifts into a kind of autopilot mode.Jolie proved in ""The Land of Blood and Honey"" that she can handle complex material. But here despite the visits to his childhood Zamperini eventually becomes a rote hero a punching bag who will never give in no matter what the price. ""If you can take it you can make it"" his brother told him long ago and while he endures unimaginable mental and physical anguish the films depiction becomes as generic as the advice. Its a shock to learn during the credits for instance that after the war he marries his longtime sweetheart -- shes never even been hinted at.Make no mistake every aspect of this story is worthy as is every second of Zamperinis sacrifice. But by repeating the same notes again and again Jolie eventually mutes much of their power and their effect.Unbroken3.5 stars (out of 5)Director Angelina Jolie.Cast Jack OConnell Miyavi Domhnall Gleeson.Rating PG-13 for war violence including intense sequences of brutality and for brief language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Thats the lesson that was drummed into Louis Zamperinis head from boyhood back when he was getting picked on by toughs for being Italian back when he was running track and ready to drop. ""If you can take it you can make it."" Keep going. Keep running. And if you fall get up again. Because if you never quit -- if you never stop -- then you can never really lose. It got Zamperini to the 1936 Olympics. And later it would take him through getting shot down over the Pacific drifting for nearly seven weeks in shark-infested waters and more than two years of starvation forced labor and brutality in a Japanese P.O.W camp. Just one more day. And then another after that. This is the relentless unflagging -- and yet never repetitive -- pace of ""Unbroken"" a moving inspirational slightly safe and comfortably old-fashioned drama from Angelina Jolie. Based on the Laura Hillenbrand best-seller (with a screenplay assist from a number of good writers including Richard LaGravanese and the Coen brothers) the film at first cuts between Zamperinis childhood in Depression-Era California and his career in the U.S. Air Force (he enlisted three months before Pearl Harbor). Shot through with warm sunlight and a never-cloying attention to period detail the California scenes - carefully framed lit and shot - have an unfussy Hollywood style that brings to mind Clint Eastwood. (Perhaps Jolie was paying more-than-usual attention on the set of ""Changeling"" back in 2008.) But as the home and high-schools scenes fade away and the war takes over the cutting gets a little more rapid the angles more dramatic. And then Louis is shot down. And then sharks start circling his flimsy lifeboat. And then hes picked up by the Japanese Navy and impossibly things get even worse. Handsome alert and intensely focused little-known English actor Jack OConnell is a fine choice as Louis. And Japanese pop star Takamasa ""Miyavi"" Ishihara shines as ""The Bird Louis sadistic captor and war criminal in training. If the film has a large flaw its that it seems too worried about horrifying us (or losing its PG-13 rating); after tortures which should leave OConnell little more than a bloody pulp he sports only a bad black eye and some bruises. But look past that nervousness and youll see an interesting universal relevance here as Jolie couches the two mens relationship in the language of domestic abuse. ""Why do you make me hit you?"" the captor asks after pummeling his prisoner unmercifully. Their bonds are those of victor and victim and yet there are links of emotion and intimacy and dependency here too; although the sadist doesnt deserve our sympathy Jolie suggests that to break the cycle understanding is necessary as well. And something more although its not ours to give. Jolie doesnt hit this point too hard -- except for a sequence with Louis holding aloft a two-by-four like part of a cross -- but faith and the acceptance that comes with it was an ever-larger part of Zamperinis life. And in fact it may be the most important part of this film. Because in the end perhaps survival isnt the best revenge. Perhaps forgiveness is. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Unbroken (PG-13) Universal (137 min.) Directed by Angelina Jolie. With Jack OConnell Takamasa Ishihara.

Its repeated like a mantra ""If you can take it you can make it."" Those words drive Louis Zamperini to endure from an Olympic race track to a Japanese POW camp. Theyre also useful words for the viewer who might balk before buying a ticket to ""Unbroken"" or be tempted to bale after Zamperinis umpteenth lashing at the hands of a sadistic guard. Tough it out. This is tremendously rewarding filmmaking from an unexpected source.When Angelina Jolie befriended Zamperini they couldnt have seemed more different. He was in his 90s and since World War II he had lived an almost monastic life. She was the most glamorous and publicized movie star on earth. But the army veteran and the U.N. emissary shared a willingness to look suffering in the eye.Jolies debut as a director ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" was an unflinching account of atrocities during the Bosnian civil war. ""Unbroken"" is equally traumatic but it has a Hollywood sheen that makes it an easier pill to swallow. The young Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy) is a tough truant Italian-American kid on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Encouraged by his older brother to channel his energy into running he grows into a world-class athlete (played eventually by Jack OConnell). He competes in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin (the one where Jesse Owen stole the thunder from Adolf Hitler) and if you dont pay close attention you might get the mistaken impression that Zamperini wins his race. But his eyes are on the 1940 Olympics scheduled for Tokyo.Instead he finds himself in the bombardiers seat of a B-24 thats flying over Japanese territory. Like so many of the carefully composed scenes in the movie a pair of crash-landings at the start of the film are as vivid as anything in the Spielberg canon. But when Zamperini and two crewmates bob to the surface in a life raft their ordeal is just beginning. After 47 days of battling sharks sunburn and saltwater theres good news and bad news. Theyre rescued but tossed into the clutches of prison-camp commander Watanabe (played by the androgynous Japanese pop star Miyavi). In the overlong series of beatings and humiliations theres a psycho-sexual dynamic between Zamperini and Watanabe who whispers that he respects the Olympian for enduring so much punishment. But if the movie is more about suffering than heroism the suffering is rooted in religious faith that OConnell conveys with a quiet sincerity. It helps that the script is by Joel and Ethan Coen who dont indulge in dramatic grandstanding.If you can take it ""Unbroken"" will lift you like the classics of adventure cinema.{amp;rule}What ""Unbroken""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 217  Content War violence including intense sequences of brutality and for brief strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 635pm on Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Wednesday Dec. 24 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are three names to remember coming out of Unbroken director Angelina Jolies handsomely mounted old-fashioned ode to heroism under hell fire Louis Zamperini Jack OConnell and Takamasa Ishihara better known as Miyavi.Zamperini is the 30s-era Olympics distance runner who after joining the Air Force during WWII spent 47 days adrift in the Pacific following a plane crash and then spent several years as a prisoner of war in Japanese labor camps. His amazing story is brought to life through OConnell an up-and-coming British actor who here gives a go-for-broke performance after having already gotten noticed this year in the excellent but little-seen prison drama Starred Up. Miyavis day job is as a rock star in his native Japan but in Unbroken where he plays prison-camp commander Watanabe (aka The Bird) -- the man who wants to break Zamperini physically and emotionally -- audiences will only see him as one thing the embodiment of cruelty.These three performances along with the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins lend Unbroken -- which in other ways is a rather routine survivors story -- its sense of immediacy and urgency.The film begins in Southern California where a young Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy) gives his Italian immigrant mother plenty of reason to worry with his reckless petty criminal behavior. His brother senses that Louis is headed down the wrong path and convinces him to join the school track team. It would be the first step that would take him to the 1936 Olympics.As written by Joel and Ethan Coen (yes those Coens) Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson this is all dealt with in a fairly perfunctory way; the movie is in a rush to get to Louis crash survival at sea and finally a horrific prison-camp experience that would have felled lesser men. This is one of those cases where the subjects wildly colorful life already chronicled in Laura Hillenbrands book on which the film is based deserves the broader scope that a mini-series could provide.While OConnell remains the focus several of the actors playing his fellow captives stand out especially Domhnall Gleeson who seems to be wasting away in front of our eyes. Unbroken Jolies second film as a features director (the first was the Bosnian War-themed In the Land of Blood and Honey) is hardly the work of a cinematic revolutionary. At times its formulaic to the point of cliche.But when Zamperini and Watanabe face off in a war of wills that doesnt matter. Besides if nothing else its certainly better than the last time a good-looking Hollywood star decided to direct a movie about WWII. But the less said about George Clooneys The Monuments Men the better . Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

(Needless to say I dont mean to imply a connection between this and the House of Representatives recent ""torture report"" which is obviously a partisan effort to make a few bad apples stand for the CIA under the rigorously ethical Bush-Cheney administration. Perish the thought.) At its essence Unbroken is a tribute to manly perseverance its message so nice its stated twice ""If you can take it you can make it."" Taking the film is no walk in the park either. The young British actor Jack OConnell is Zamperini whom we meet aiming bombs while his plane-mates do battle with a swarm of Japanese Zeroes. Things are soon dire -- which is Jolies cue throughout the film to move in on Louiss face as he recalls symbolic moments in his life. Among them being bullied by kids who call him a ""Dago."" His episodes of juvenile delinquency. His beginnings as a runner under the training of his older brother who gives him the ""if you can take it you can make it"" maxim. His trip to the Berlin Olympics in 1932. But the bulk of Unbroken is present tense with a vengeance. Zamperini spends more than 40 ghastly days on a life raft with two other airmen (played by Domhnall Gleason and Finn Wittrock) and his ""rescue"" leads somewhere arguably worse to a prison-camp commander known as ""the Bird"" whose mission in life becomes to take the American Olympian and break him. From the time Zamperinis plane hits the water the movie is one blow after another after another after another a hundred times more. Possibly Im undercounting. The soldiers are so skeletal that its difficult to look at them and in one late scene the Bird forces scores of American and English prisoners to line up and punch Zamperini in the face. Unbelievably it gets even worse after that. Jolie is actually restrained compared to Hillenbrand who -- as she proved in her unusually graphic Seabiscuit and even more so in UnbrokenA -- is a glutton for her subjects punishment. But the film is still relentlessly one thing its message (aside from ""If you can take it you can make it"") a mixture of Rocky Balboa and Christ To remain standing when your persecutor has devastated you physically and emotionally is the best revenge and you should forgive rather than retaliate in kind. Speaking personally I couldnt agree more. But the movies more powerful takeaway is that girly men with daddy issues should not hold positions of power. As the Bird Jolie has cast the Japanese glam-rocker known as Miyavi (real name Takamasa Ishihara) and directed him to bat his lashes and gaze on Zamperini with a mixture of rage and longing. A British officer fills out the Birds biography -- wealthy childhood militaristic family deemed unfit for combat -- before adding ""None of this explains his erratic behavior."" No his erratic behavior reads like Sexual Perversity in Tokyo. The homoeroticism is as they say ""a choice"" but its possible that it throws Unbroken out of whack. There is plenty whack left of course though much of it feels secondhand. Jolies last film In the Land of Blood and Honey had more evident passion (it centered on a sadomasochistic relationship between a Serbian officer and Bosnian woman); this one often feels like rewarmed Spielberg. The opening shot of American planes drifting out of a sunrise is gorgeous but obviously computer-generated and many of the images are self-consciously iconic. The script -- credited to the tag team of William Nicholson Richard LaGravenese and Joel and Ethan Coen -- is a little on the nose for my taste short on the kind of stray narrative curlicues that give movies some extra texture. And does Jolie get all she can out of OConnell who was riveting in this years prison drama Starred Up? Youll largely remember him here for his cheekbones and ability to take a punch. Still Jolie gets the dirty/ennobling job done. If the narrative is finally unsatisfying its because the last vital chapter -- the way in which Zamperini was able to have a life after years of unspeakable cruelty and the dashing of his Olympic hopes -- is signaled in a couple of title cards before the closing credits. Unbroken proves that Zamperini could take it and make it -- but make what of it?

"Review Unbroken indeed yet Jolie chooses agony over redemption - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Unbroken indeed yet Jolie chooses agony over redemption Review Unbroken indeed yet Jolie chooses agony over redemption Universal Studios An excellent Jack OConnell right portrays Louis Zamperini shown adrift in the ocean with Capt. Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) in the true-life ""Unbroken."" An excellent Jack OConnell right portrays Louis Zamperini shown adrift in the ocean with Capt. Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) in the true-life ""Unbroken."" (Universal Studios) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Unbroken impresses but angelinajolie glosses over inspiring aspects of Louis Zamperinis life Despite its many impressive elements ""Unbroken"" plays incomplete and unbalanced. The film has made a decision not to tell all of Louis Zamperinis riveting true story and that choice costs it in the end.As detailed by Laura Hillenbrand in a book that has sold 4 million copies and spent more than three years on the New York Times bestseller list Zamperinis epic saga has so much incident and drama it seems as if it couldnt have all happened to one man. But as Hillenbrand explains it did ""The hellion youth; the superlative speed that carried him to the Olympics; the harrowing hours as a World War II bombardier; a plane crash; 47 days and 2000 miles as a raft-bound castaway; capture; an epic struggle as an enslaved prisoner of war; years entangled in the terrors of PTSD; and a final beautiful moment of redemption. This was the stuff of legend.""This was also the stuff that attracted the attention of Angelina Jolie looking for a directing project to follow her involving debut ""In the Land of Blood and Honey."" She was captivated by Zamperinis story and Hillenbrands book which is subtitled a story of ""Survival Resilience and Redemption."" In the interviews shes given in support of ""Unbroken"" Jolie has emphasized the inspirational redemptive aspect of Zamperinis life. That refers to the mans terribly difficult post-war path including a five-year battle with raging alcoholism and a murderous post-traumatic stress disorder obsession with revenge followed by a Billy Graham-inspired religious awakening that changed his life all of which makes up the gripping concluding section of Hillenbrands book. Unbroken trailer This is the movie trailer for the Universal Pictures movie ""Unbroken."" ""Unbroken"" will be screened at ESS. This is the movie trailer for the Universal Pictures movie ""Unbroken."" ""Unbroken"" will be screened at ESS. See more videos Yet this compelling final act of Zamperinis story is inexplicably dealt with as an afterthought by the film relegated to a few brief seconds of text on screen before the final credits roll.This not only robs the tale of one of its most dramatic elements it also has an unfortunate side effect. Because of the large amount of time spent on Zamperinis nightmare 2 1/2 years in Japanese prison camps the exclusion wreaks havoc with the storys equilibrium making ""Unbroken"" into a film about torture more than one about redemption.That is a shame because Jolie working with top-drawer cinematographer Roger Deakins and building on the promise of her first film does strong involving work as a director giving ""Unbroken"" something of the classic feeling that Clint Eastwood gives to his work including the one (""The Changeling"") that top-lined Jolie herself. While director Angelina Jolie was at home fighting off chicken pox the films stars husband Brad Pitt and their family represented at the World War II dramas Hollywood premiere. (Nardine Saad) ""Unbroken"" also has the advantage of having a terrific young actor Britains Jack OConnell (excellent in the British indie film ""Starred Up"") to play Zamperini. Gifted with emotions but also possessed of a cocky physicality OConnell has something of the air of Jimmy Cagney about him as he portrays a man who lives by the code that ""if you can take it you can make it.""""Unbroken"" gives screen credit to a whole platoon of writers -- Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson -- and it has chosen to start at a particularly dramatic moment Lt. Zamperini hard at work as a World War II Army Air Corps bombardier flying with his pal Capt. Phil Phillips (a fine Domhnall Gleeson) on a B-24 bombing raid.As all havoc breaks loose in the air the film switches to a series of flashbacks starting with Zamperinis hell-raiser childhood as the son of Italian immigrants in Torrance who was beaten by the other kids just for having foreign-born parents. Zamperini was always focused on survival even then.Encouraged by his brother Pete (Alex Russell) Zamperini channels his fury into distance running. He gets good enough as a 19-year-old high schooler to make the U.S. team for the 1936 Olympics and runs such a torrid final lap in the 5000 meters that he gets to chat with Hitler himself. (That meeting sadly did not make it into the film.)Back at the war Zamperini is sent on another mission that has a catastrophic ending His plane is shot down over the Pacific and only three of the 11-man crew Zamperini Capt. Phillips and tail gunner Mac McNamara (Finn Wittrock) survive the crash landing.Zamperini endures a soul-destroying 47 days on a 6-foot-by-2-foot raft fighting off sharks and drifting for what feels like forever before a Japanese vessel picks him up and sends him to the first of a series of nightmarish prison camps.The black heart of the nightmare was Cpl. Mutsuhiro Watanabe otherwise known as the Bird a man who made inflicting an endless series of brutal beyond-sadistic punishments on Zamperini his lifes work.The torture inflicted on Zamperini including having 220 fellow prisoners hit him in the face one after another is so awful that we not only wonder how the man himself endured it we worry if we will survive its cinematic depiction. Japanese rock star Miyavi does a capable job as the Bird but his character is finally too similar to bestial Japanese cinematic commanders of the past from ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" to ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" to completely hold our interest.The same can be said finally of ""Unbroken."" With what we see on screen weighted too much toward pain and too little toward redemption this is a film we respect more than love and that is something of a wasted opportunity.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Unbroken Jack OConnell on shooting the key beam scene Oscar Watch Could Jake Gyllenhaal get Angelina Jolie a margarita?

"Unbrokens focus on suffering misses the mark review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUnbrokens focus on suffering misses the mark reviewIn telling the story of an Olympian runner turned heroic Second World War survivor Angelina Jolies Unbroken focuses on overcoming adversity at the expense of almost everything else.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 24 2014UnbrokenStarring Jack OConnell Domhnall Gleeson Finn Wittrock Miyavi and Garrett Hedlund. Directed by Angelina Jolie. Opens Dec. 25 at GTA theatres. 137 minutes. 14A""The salvation of man is through love and in love"" wrote Second World War concentration camp survivor Dr. Viktor Frankl in Mans Search for Meaning a celebrated 1946 memoir and therapeutic journal.Frankl found he could transcend horrific suffering by concentrating on memories of beloved friends and family. His highly readable account ennobles and transfixes.Article Continued BelowIts quite different in other words from what Angelina Jolie is doing with Unbroken her well-intended but one-dimensional account of wartime stoicism adapted for the screen from Laura Hillenbrands bestselling 2010 biography of the same name.From left Finn Witrock Domhnall Gleeson and Jack OConnell are adrift in a lifeboat before being captured as prisoners of war in Unbroken.For Jolie its all about the suffering without much meaning. Zamperinis postwar religious works which indicate he transcended his pain by promising to serve God get little more than a tangential mention.In telling the story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack OConnell) an Olympian runner turned heroic Second World War survivor of air sea and land traumas she has chosen to focus on overcoming adversity at the expense of almost everything else.It makes for a very tough film to sit through despite its obvious sincerity toward both its subject and its desire to reap Oscar ambitions.Jolies intentions are telegraphed right from the beginning and throughout the film from the preacher who counsels ""Accept the darkness live through the night love thine enemies"" to the brother who sloganeers ""If you can take it you can make it.""No question that Zamperini the scrappy American son of Italian immigrants who died this past summer at the age of 97 just as Jolie was locking her film makes for a most compelling and sympathetic subject. And OConnell does him proud demonstrating the grit and steel of a man who had to fight not just to succeed but simply to survive.An Olympic runner in the 1936 ""Hitler Olympics"" in Berlin who became an ace U.S. air force bombardier when war commenced Zamperini survived being lost at sea for 47 days after being shot down over Japan. He later spent two years in a PoW camp at the hands of that same Asian enemy.With a subject this fascinating along with Roger Deakins as her cinematographer Alexandre Desplat as her composer and Joel and Ethan Coen assisting with the screenplay Jolie has ample material for a film that truly would deserve Oscar laurels.Yet shes delivered a film that is strangely bereft of real drama apart from a thrilling early sequence in which OConnells cumbersome B-24 bomber does battle with nimble Japanese Zero fighters winning the skirmish but losing the argument with gravity. The plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean leaving Louie stranded with two life rafts but not much food and water in the company of his pilot Capt. Russell Alan ""Phil"" Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and tail gunner Sgt. Francis ""Mac"" McNamara (Finn Wittrock).The clock ticks grimly on as the men struggle to subsist on what few fish they can pull out of the ocean including a shark Zamperini punches into submission.The situation could hardly get worse except it does. When rescue finally comes its in the form of brutal Japanese soldiers and solitary prison confinement. Zamperini is singled out for special abuse from the PoWs most sociopathic official a Japanese army sergeant known as ""Bird"" (Miyavi) whose antipathy toward Louie seems based solely on eye contact he doesnt appreciate. The rest of the movie is an exercise in adversity for the audience too as Jolie subjects the viewer to relentless torture scenes. Where other directors might have used judicious edits to show a scene where Bird punishes Zamperini by forcing his fellow PoWs to punch him in the face one at a time Jolie insists on letting it all roll out almost in its entirety. Punishing overuse of close-ups makes the watching all the more difficult.On another occasion Jolie seems curiously unaware of the exertion expended. Following the race at the Olympics where Louie set a record for final-lap speed hes shown with nary a drop of sweat on his body or brow.Theres no question that Unbroken is a major step up in ambition scope and achievement from Jolies 2011 directing debut In the Land of Blood and Honey.And theres no denying her interest in Zamperini and her desire to do right by him in telling his story. Yet in concentrating so much on his suffering rather than what meaning he drew from it shes left Unbroken in fragments.Read more about Angelina JolieThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The story is true and astounding. In 1943 Louis Zamperini an athlete turned B-24 bombardier for the U.S. Army Air Force crashed in the South Pacific and drifted 47 days in a deflating raft with two other lacerated crewmen. The hellish limbo amid ocean swells blazing sun and circling sharks did not end with a rescue but a capture. The Japanese Navy shipped them to prisoner of war camps where they were treated with inhuman brutality. As a castaway story a historical drama and a portrait of an Olympian turned soldier ""Unbroken"" is a touching and important work. Angelina Jolie who directed the 2011 Bosnian war romance ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" returns to that role to create a film both heartbreaking and inspiring huge and subtle in every frame every scene every interaction. It captures World War IIs Pacific theater neglected by filmmakers in remarkable spectacle (the cinematographer is the excellent Roger Deakins). Presenting the POW drama like some terrible hallucination of the systematic collapse of society the film is a breathtaking exploration of wartime human nature from animalistic savagery to inspiring heroism. Above all its a great portrait of the singular Zamperini the kind of man who struggles to stand straight however life beats him down. Even when the risks are extraordinary. Played by C.J. Valleroy as a youngster hes introduced as a regular churchgoer with his family but not a particularly good kid. Hes a bullied child a trivial thief and serial runaway whose brother Pete (Alex Russell) teaches him a better use for his speed. ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"" Pete declares at the track. Life will test that prediction. Zamperini trains hard becoming a superb distance runner who excels at Hitlers 1936 Berlin Olympics. Jack OConnell gives a nuanced performance as the older Zamperini who enters adulthood with kindness and optimism. When he and his fellow airmen are trapped at sea he offers stories of the feasts his mother will cook them when they arrive home and helps them sleep with a gentle hug each punishing day. Universal Pictures Jack OConnell stars as Olympian and war hero Louis Zamperini in ""Unbroken"" adapted from Laura Hillenbrands nonfiction bestseller. Striking physical transformations show the effects of the ocean odyssey on the crewmen. Theres no wasted dialogue (the screenplay was cowritten by Joel and Ethan Coen). OConnells eyes reveal his awareness of danger and hunger for escape. Nor does Jolie waste time with needless explanations of Zamperinis confinement. The cruel guard whom prisoners call the Bird (Japanese musician Miyavi) recognizes Zamperini as an Olympic standout and abuses him with savage violence out of personal spite. When hes bored with torturing Zamperini with a bamboo stick he orders every prisoner to punch him as hard as possible in the face. Scene after scene unfolds without words. Watching an army of exhausted Allied prisoners pull heavy coal bags up and down as they climb exhausting heights is as painful as any verbal interchange. The films emotional center is a scene of punishment that Jolie visualizes with rich biblical significance. The Bird who has pushed Zamperini nearly to death with exhaustion orders him to raise a heavy timber plank over his head and keep it in the air or be shot. OConnells stance and powerful expression resemble something from a crucifixion painting. The life force of the human spirit is repeatedly touched by Alexandre Desplats stunning score but its Jolies stellar technique that gives ""Unbroken"" its remarkable power. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

But it would have been even more so without making Zamperini an almost saintlike figure. By Peter Rainer Film critic December 24 2014 Save for later Saved Unbroken stars Jack OConnell. David James/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide ""Unbroken"" Angelina Jolies second tour of duty as a director - her first was the estimable 2011 Serbian war drama ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" - is a movie about anguish and survival that rarely reaches the peak of passion.Her source material is Laura Hillenbrands mega-bestseller about Olympic runner Louis Zamperini (Jack OConnell) who endured 47 days marooned on a raft when his plane was shot down over the Pacific in WWII only to be incarcerated for over two years in the most brutal of Japanese POW camps. (Screenplay credit goes to Joel and Ethan Coen whose trademark dark wit is nowhere to be found here as well as Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson.) His chief nemesis in the camps is a sadistic camp commandant Watanabe nicknamed ""the Bird"" (Miyavi) who inflicts all manner of gruesome punishments including in one protracted scene forcing a long line of inmates one after the other to punch Zamperini in the face. (By comparison J.K. Simmons in ""Whiplash"" is a puttytat). And yet the ordeals endured by Zamperini (who died in July at age 97) and the others seem not enough given what these men as described in Hillenbrands book actually went through. Jolies direction after a slam-bang beginning involving a shot-up B-24 is too conventionally rendered for such a harrowing story. OConnells performance is in the same vein No matter how much he suffers I couldnt get away from the fact that this was an actor putting on a show. And Jolie inexplicably misses some obvious opportunities like the moment as described in Hillebrands book when Zamperini after running his heart out in the 1936 Berlin Olympics meets Hitler. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Zamperinis life story is genuinely inspirational but the movie seems fashioned as a standard-issue profile in courage with Zamperini after a troubled youth transformed into an almost saintlike figure. He would have been every bit as inspirational even more so without the halo. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for war violence including intense sequences of brutality and for brief language.)

In the year-end glut of holiday films a lot of new ones will be around to keep you entertained but The New York Observer wont. Im off to wrap some gifts ring some bells and get some sleep. Well return with our first issue of a brand new year on January 7. Meanwhile heres a rundown of whats coming in the weeks ahead. UNBROKEN Put this one at the top of your must-see list. Angelina Jolie might not in my opinion have yet reached the heights of the acting profession but with this passionate inspired technically awesome and profoundly exciting chronicle of the life of Louie Zamperini the American Olympic athlete who survived 47 days in a lifeboat and two years as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II she rises to the top rank of first-class film directors in a male-dominated field overcrowded with hacks. Beginning with a troubled childhood as the son of Italian immigrants in California Louie was an outsider who seemed destined for a life of crime but it was the guidance of an older brother that gave him a talisman to live by ""If I can take it I can make it."" Played with enormous charisma and extraordinary physical endurance by rising U.K. newcomer and inevitable future star Jack OConnell Louie moves from the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin to the rank of pilot shot down with two comrades and left wounded and bleeding in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific. Then the capture by the Japanese Navy--plunged into an underground hole where he listened to his best friend being tortured and finally found himself the personal victim of a sadistic commandant (played unflinchingly by the Japanese singer-composer Miyavi) who subjected him to years of unflagging brutality. Angelina Jolies Unbroken tells the story of P.O.W. Louie Zamperini. Its hard to believe anyone could survive inhumanities this severe and still live but Louie earned a Purple Heart realized his dream of attending one last Olympics (in Japan of all places) and went on to tell his story in the critically acclaimed biography Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand which spent 180 weeks on the best-seller list before becoming the source material for this remarkable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Ms. Jolies obsession with Louie who died in July at age 97 informs every scene. The air strikes and raft and camp sequences hold equal weight the camerawork by Roger Deakins is magnificent and the vast supporting cast of unknowns including Domhnall Gleeson Garrett Hedlund Finn Wittrock and Luke Treadaway is exemplary. Although it eschews the usual P.O.W. camp cliches Unbroken is probably too grim brutal and depressing for most viewers and the decision to open it on Christmas Day is questionable. But as a tribute to one heros fortitude in refusing to give in to evil it gives off its own admirable feeling of positive spiritual energy that left me feeling good about the best qualities of mankind. One of the finest achievements of the 2014 film year. AMERICAN SNIPER Another war biopic opening on Christmas day with tight two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper as a Texas rodeo cowboy full of anger and rage who channels his natural-born killer instincts into a life of positive aggression fighting terrorists as Chris Kyle Americas most decorated Navy SEAL. On his first day of duty hes assigned to protect the Marines from enemy snipers killing a woman and a child carrying a grenade in the bargain. From there on his constant raids on Muslim homes grow more repetitive as the mans civilian problems lead to panic and impotence. After four tours of duty 1000 days on the battlefield and 163 kills Chris comes home for good but the psychological damage has been severe. Clint Eastwood directs American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper. With this film Mr. Eastwood seems to dedicate his hawks eye vision of ""supporting the troops"" to an unpopular continuation of the ongoing war in Iraq but his direction has none of the vigor of either of his previous war efforts Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. Bradley Cooper imbues Chris Kyle with the sensitivity charm and adrenalin lacking elsewhere in Jason Halls screenplay and Sienna Miller is very good as his long-suffering wife Taya. But theres no freshness in either the domestic scenes or the combat sequences that all look like outtakes from The Hurt Locker. The locales do at least look authentic though Iraq is played by Morocco. SELMA This somber by-the-numbers movie about Martin Luther King co-produced by Oprah Winfrey is not just about the man the speech or the holiday--but also the ideals and fight for dignity that led to the Nobel Prize. Race relations are still a dangerous and sensitive subject after all these years especially in light of recent headlines about racial profiling and the riots in Ferguson and other cities. But as vital as it is racial strife is a subject that cries out for a more volatile treatment than this. The Alabama marching sequences and resulting violence filmed in Selma where they actually happened are too understated for my taste. And the home life of King and his vacillating wife Coretta are muted. While he rallied for federal legislation guaranteeing every person in America the right to vote regardless of color he was opposed by the White House and denounced by J. Edgar Hoover and the F.B.I. as a political and moral degenerate. Yet he turned the other cheek until his own people challenged his sincerity. Words from the Bible still dont carry any more weight  today than they did against the whips Remingtons and helicopters that captivated and polarized a nation in the 1960s. Everyone is just too damn polite Still director Ava DuVernay has done a commendable job of enlightening American school kids about a chapter in history theyve both ignored and forgotten. And theres a powerfully nuanced and award-worthy performance by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King. THE GAMBLER Another wet battery about a week in the life of a gambling addict with a jaundiced-looking Mark Wahlberg as a Los Angeles loser who owes 240000 to various and sundry mobsters illegal gambling rings and bail bondsmen who beat him to bloody hamburger and give him seven days to pay--or end up in the La Brea tar pits. By day hes a failed novelist-turned-associate professor of English Literature by night a hopeless loser who even wipes out his own mother (a hard venomous wasted Jessica Lange) to stake him to another roll of the roulette wheel. This is a remake of a 1974 bomb with James Caan based on a book by James Toback with overtones of Dostoevsy director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) is too inert and nuance-free to detect. Richard Brooks made a tougher and much better film about the tragedy of compulsive gambling in his 1985 film Fever Pitch and in 1949s The Lady Gambles even Barbara Stanwyck made a more convincing fall from respectability into casino hell than Mark Wahlberg does here. BIG EYES Tim Burtons penchant for the bizarre well serves this odd investigation of the scandal behind the marriage of artist Margaret Keane who created a kitschy world of popular but widely reviled paintings of bereft waifs with huge myopic eyes that sold like proverbial hotcakes (but were far less appetizing) and her ambitious money-hungry and manipulative husband Walter Keane who claimed to be the actual artist using his wifes success to steal the fame and fortune for himself. She was putty in his hands a pushover who went along with his schemes even allowing him to sign his own name to her work until she finally spilled the beans and sued him for slander. Amy Adams stars as Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. After years of bickering and a fair amount of illegitimate larceny the marriage came to a screeching public halt in a courtroom battle where the judge forced the estranged parties to stand before two blank canvases and prove the legitimacy of their claims. (Its the best scene in the picture.) Walter (gregarious Christoph Waltz delightfully oozing insincere charm) died in 2000 broke but still insisting he was no phony. Margaret (Amy Adams unrecognizable in a bottle-blond wig) fled to Hawaii (a perfect place for bad art) opened a new gallery and still paints every day. More subdued than usual Tim Burton presents both a creepy view of a disastrous marriage and an indictment of the tasteless commercial 1950s art scene where goofy fads seduced ignorant collectors into clamoring for ugly ornaments to match their living room walls. Nimble off the beaten track and very entertaining its the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp. MR. TURNER This film focuses on a different kind of artist--the Victorian radical J.M.W. Turner whose vast spreads of landscapes and sailing ships vanishing into muted mists were largely dismissed in 1845 as a big waste of oil. Queen Victoria thought they were ugly. I agree with Vicky. But this prosaic and vapid bore by long-winded critically overpraised director Mike Leigh is even worse--a vacuous endurance test about an abstract loser struggling for recognition among the Impressionists of his time although we are told he is now considered an Old Master who hangs in museums (the Met owns a few) who influenced Monet and was once defended by Thackeray. He is now defended by movie critics although the reasons are specious--mainly because he is played in this droning yawn by bulbous double-chinned character actor Timothy Spall. Timothy Spall as J.M.W. Turner. The real Turner we are told was a cruel doleful and irritating heel who frittered away his time in seedy brothels insulted the cherished artists of the day and deserted his family leaving them penniless and neglected while he occasionally indulged in bad sex with his pickle-faced hunchback housekeeper. Later he took up with a widowed landlady who rented rooms in the remote port village of Margate where he went to paint whales. With this slow-moving film as evidence--the weirdly overrated equivalent to watching a mud puddle dry--there was nothing remotely interesting about anything he did in life that is worth making a two-hour-plus movie about. Mr. Spall winner of the Cannes and New York Film Critics Circle best-actor awards does his best to bring an unpleasant character to life--grunting and snorting like a boar ready to charge spitting on his canvases and dragging around with a constant wince like a fat baby with colic. With all due respect hes too repulsive to watch for 150 minutes. INTO THE WOODS The new Disney extravaganza Rob Marshall (Chicago) has made of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical is another example of concept over coherence but the entertainment value is considerable. Mr. Sondheim explores the only terrain left to us in which optimism and magic are still possible in a world gone psychotically sour--the landscape of fairy tales. And then he turns enchanted dreams into terrifying nightmares only Freud could understand. Dont take the children. Mr. Marshall uses several interlocking tales to plunge us into the woods of our imagination--three Grimm classics about Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk--plus a newly invented one about a childless baker and his wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) who can lift an evil witchs curse if they can deliver to the old crone Cinderellas slipper Reds red cape and Jacks cow. The witch throws in Rapunzels golden hair too just to make the task more difficult. This first act long but engaging is nothing more than a merry scavenger hunt which also introduces a corny Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp) two handsome mixed-up princes (Chris Pine for Cinderella Billy Magnussen for Rapunzel) Cinderellas wicked stepmother (a hilarious Christine Baranski) and Meryl Streep acting all over the place as the flaky sentimental and always exhausted witch. Their stories intertwine as they trip through an enchanted forest that looks like a thicket of marzipan pretzels. Chris Pine stars as Cinderellas Prince in Into the Woods. Then in Act Two the characters get what the Sondheim-Lapine team thinks they deserve--and nobody lives happily ever after. So its back ""into the woods"" again to confront such jet-age traumas as moral disintegration deception lies betrayal disillusionment fear cowardice regrets doomed relationships failed marriages and death. The woods become such a jumble of gnarled ideas and convoluted metaphors that we quickly lose our way--and our interest. The witch loses her powers Cinderellas prince turns out to be a heel (""I was raised to be charming not sincere"") and the wife of the giant Jack returns to wreak havoc. The point of all this pseudo-intellectual gardening I suppose is to prove that fairy tales do not have happy endings and be careful what you wish for because it might make you miserable. The book is a maze in which there is no door marked ""EXIT"" the best songs like ""Children Will Listen"" and ""You Are Not Alone"" are scattered like bits of dialogue and sound derivative of songs from other Sondheim scores. Still there is much to admire here from the candyfloss costumes to the tricky special effects and the thrill of hearing everyone sing surprisingly well. (Anna Kendrick has a gorgeous soprano and Chris Pine displays wit and a musical range I never thought possible.) I left disenchanted and irritated by so many missed opportunities. Fairy tales do have happy endings despite what Mr. Sondheim might say to the contrary. And there is something wrong with any dramatized fairy tale set to music if when you go away the score is so forgettable that theres nothing to hum but the beanstalk. See you in January.

"Every Which Way But Loose Clint Eastwoods American Sniper and Angelina Jolies Eastwood Impersonation Unbroken << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Every Which Way But Loose Clint Eastwoods American Sniper and Angelina Jolies Eastwood Impersonation Unbroken Warner Bros. Movies December 22 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Eight years ago two Clint Eastwood war movies -- Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima -- opened within months of each other. So two opening on the same day doesnt seem that far-fetched. But what are the odds that one of the two Eastwood movies that open this Christmas Day would be directed by Angelina Jolie? Jolie played the mother in Changeling Eastwoods chilled grim missing-child melodrama from 2008. For Unbroken her adaptation of Laura Hillenbrands best-selling nonfiction account of WWII war hero Louis Zamperinis experiences Jolie appears to have absorbed the front-facing resolve shared by many of Eastwoods period movies. Its big and long and kind of puffed up and paved with craftsmanship sentimentality and generic notions of fortitude and perseverance. Its the best picture of 1948. That said Unbroken has more polish and better writing than Eastwoods own American Sniper which is based on a Navy SEALs memoir of his four tours in Iraq -- subtitled The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. The muscularity in Jolies moviemaking comes sheathed in an elegance that doesnt appear to interest Eastwood right now. His is a hard gruff no-frills strangely basic movie intended to honor its subject Chris Kyle an even-keeled Texan whose sharpshooting prowess amassed him a staggering tally of kills and nicknames like ""The Legend."" Kyle died before the film went into production a fact the movie reserves for a title card at the end -- and the heaviness of the loss hangs like an anchor around the drama. This movie is drowning in duty -- to say nothing of hoary storytelling devices and one embarrassing scene after the next for Sienna Miller as Mrs. Kyle. The film opens with Kyle (Bradley Cooper) supine on a roof in Iraq his ear cradled against his mounted rifle eyeing a shifty-looking child in his crosshairs. Will he take the shot? Patience please. The script by Jason Dean Hall orders a childhood flashback in which Kyles father has taken the boy hunting and praises his sons marksmanship as a ""gift."" An adult Kyle goes on to ride broncos and with some amusement toss his unfaithful girlfriend from their home. (""I do this to get attention"" she says. ""Dont you get that?"") He catches a Nightline report of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi and hyperventilates toward the television in a mild rage. By the next scene Kyle is at a recruitment office looking to ""be of service."" So its off to SEAL boot camp doing scissor kicks and push-ups in weighted vests in damp sand at night taking verbal abuse from the drill instructors. Were simultaneously ever closer to and further from the boy in the crosshairs. And yet theres more. At a busy local watering hole Kyle meets Millers character Taya seemingly eager to get into it with the first Neanderthal who ogles her. Kyles charming wit disarms her of course but not before her insults provoke his defensiveness (""Why would you say Im self-centered? Id lay down my life for my country"") and then his valiance. Theres a cut to him holding back her hair after she flees the bar to puke. Next come the courtship (phone calls trinket-winning trips to the carnival) and the marriage which is interrupted (or enriched) by the news that he and his team are headed to Fallujah. Then finally its back to the discomfort of those crosshairs. You understand what the film is doing. Its raising the stakes. Its giving us in Taya an emotional conduit. But her character and the writing around her are one-dimensional. The minute you see her in that bar your interest starts to flag because you presume that youre stuck with this woman and with Millers high-strung emotionalism that its only a matter of time until Tayas on the phone with Kyle saying ""Im making memories for myself."" The movie hits its bottom before that when one of those phone calls ends because just as shes telling him theyre having a boy Kyle and the troops come under attack. This incident might have really taken place but American Sniper is full of these sorts of jammed-together moments. This is the second time this season Miller has been shown bawling into a phone over a besieged husband. Her part in Foxcatcher was much smaller but she had a good scene partner in Mark Ruffalo. Here she spends a lot of her scenes alone. The movie is interested in Taya only as she relates to Kyles turmoil. Once he returns home and is in stoic despair she becomes less a character than a emotional tourniquet. Eastwood takes pains not to paint Kyle as either a yahoo or an artist. Sniping is work for Kyle and it can be dull. Kyle takes himself off roof duty to get in on the action of house-to-house calls in the hunt for the terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The film is also fitfully a modern war thriller with a pair of suspenseful set pieces involving Kyles opposite number who becomes the villain taking out U.S. fighters as he eludes capture. But you lose patience. Whats it about? The filmmakers might say its about the Cost of War and the sacrifice Kyle made. But most films about war are about costs. There is some mindfulness here in the domestic scenes such as when Kyle near his psychological bottom sits in front of a turned-off television almost wishing for another Nightline report of disaster -- something to get him back to war with someone other than himself. Even that scene brings out the constant imbalance here between the terrible kick of and jones for combat and the cruel stress of its post-traumatic hangover. Evening out those two sides never happens. The film feels structured in a way that suggests Eastwood is doing more accounting than directing. You dont feel American Sniper build toward anything. Its too mournful for even the narrative to go up. The whole movie is one long denouement. There are two big problems with this. The first is that Cooper is so good that you wish Miller would leave him alone -- or that he would leave her. Hes made everything about himself meatier -- his face his midsection that Texas accent. I dont remember an actor going this convincingly from the shallows of disposable comedy to the depths of character work from seeming to have no appreciable talent to having more than most of his peers. Coopers hustled everybody. He might be at a peak right now and whats gotten him there is that he knows what he can do -- and you sense that he can do more. In American Sniper hes not interested in acting the heroism. Hes performing the toll of the work. Hes the one aspect of the movie that doesnt feel beholden to Kyles life. Hes embodying survival. Kyle argues that he saved a lot of lives. Cooper can brag that he saved Eastwoods movie. The second problem is that the most fascinating thing about Kyles postwar civilian life is the therapeutic social work hed begun doing with other soldiers one of whom shot and killed him in early 2013. The movie doesnt bother with this at all. So to flash it up on the screen the way its done at the end is like getting doused with cold water. Kyles death is a terrible ironic cost of war. Youd much rather see a movie wrestle with that tragedy. On that front like Foxcatcher it loses its nerve. Rather than tell a dark story of a moment in time it opts to tell none.  Universal Pictures Jolie has a story with Unbroken. Its just so triumphant and so anonymously old-fashioned that it almost doesnt matter who tells it. The movie savors the pre-chewed prestige of Hillenbrands book while using a classical flashback structure to teach good Christian lessons about charity and forgiveness with Louis Zamperini (Jack OConnell) as the movies symbol. Zamperini the son of Italian immigrants in Torrance California ran the 5000 meters in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin (theres even drama in his eighth-place finish) enlisted in the Army Air Corps as a bombardier flew in the Pacific theater in WWII and was captured by the Japanese and tortured at a labor camp. The movie opens on an American bomber under Japanese fire. Its a tense elegantly assembled sequence orchestrated in tight quarters. Jolie really puts you inside the action the bullets whizzing past (and into) soldiers other planes falling out of the air the camera swinging around the aircraft. Youre aware of how great the danger is. She has control of the stress and peril maybe even the weather. The sky during this daylight sequence is sunny bright a blue that matches the ocean where the plane crashes bringing Zamperini and two other surviving soldiers (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock) down with it. They inflate a raft that becomes their home for a month and a half of shark-infested waters and bad sunburn. The flashbacks during that opening sequence to Torrance and Berlin are just used to overpump the strings-and-piano score and collect the fortune cookies in the script which has been credited to Richard LaGravenese William Nicholson and Joel and Ethan Coen. Yet Unbroken doesnt feel like the scene salad these hand-me-down screenplays sometimes do. Its smoother breaking the movie into huge sections the crash the raft the camp. Its also simplistic. The flashbacks set you up for the torture. A priest in Torrance tells his flock to ""forgive the sin"" ""accept the darkness"" and ""love thine enemy."" Zamperinis father spanks young Louie and the boy stands there and takes every whack. ""If you can take it you can make it"" says his older brother who later tells Zamperini that ""a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory."" Zamperini spends two and a half years as a POW and becomes the pet of Colonel Watanabe the flamboyantly abusive lord of the camp whos played by the Japanese pop musician Miyavi (one name for the number of dimensions in his acting). Watanabe berates Zamperini. He beats him with a bamboo stick and instructs the other inmates to sock Zamperini in the face. Or else. Of course the marketing for the movie bears down on one image of OConnell holding a beam above his head under threat of death. You want to say its unfair that the movie gives away its crowning scene. But that scene appears to be everything to the movie proof of superhuman resilience. The other men stop what theyre doing to watch the show and even Watanabe is left to tremble and well up in awe of this wartime messiah. It doesnt feel terribly mysterious what would draw Jolie to Zamperinis story. Its an obvious show of strength. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and editor Tim Squyres provide the gleam and rhythm to temper her interest in the exposure of sinew. OConnell whos English appears to be the right actor for the misery called for in Unbroken. He suffers and quivers with dignity. But this movie is as uninterested in a persons internal workings as Jolies acting is. Everything about her is externalized. That once was the Eastwood way too and its a respectable way of existing in the world but its a limited style for dramatic storytelling. All the movies tension comes down to whether Zamperini can withstand Watanabes abuse which is probably when its helpful to forget the title. Jolies previous film In the Land of Blood and Honey was a love story (written by her) in Bosnian and Serbo-Croatian about two lovers on different sides of the Bosnian War. Its the sort of thing youd expect from a Hollywood-reared United Nations goodwill ambassador a Harlequin war drama. But it wasnt an embarrassment either. What it lacked in voice and point of view it almost made up for in gumption. Who but Madonna wouldve tried that? Conventionally speaking Unbroken is a better movie. Its ritzier-looking. It wants you to notice it to give it things. Jolie might say its important. But Unbroken feels defensive. Its a film she needed to show either to herself that she could make or to her skeptical peers. She clearly adores Zamperini. (The movie ends with a featurette about the actual man who died in July at the age of 97.) You cant help but admire him as much for what he survived as the good he did with that survival. But Jolies ideas of importance are so bland so impersonal that you dont stand a chance of being taken in by what shes offering. Shes not yet 40 but shes made the movie of someone twice her age and with none of the wisdom. Eastwoods American Sniper doesnt work but its a neutral war movie by a star whose screen persona was forged on a vengeful keeping of social order. Eastwood is 84 and hes mellowed now. Hes been working introspectively self-challengingly for more than 20 years. Dirty Harry cleans up and complicates his act. Jolie showed us something new this summer in Maleficent an exciting mix of feminist principle and movie-star image bolstering. She was exploring the danger in herself. But you watch Unbroken and wonder why the woman who made it -- the woman whos been trying to do a Cleopatra movie for years -- wants to be Clint Eastwood when she hasnt even finished being herself. This piece has been updated to reflect that Louis Zamperini was in the Army Air Corps not the Air Force.

"Unbroken (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Unbroken (PG-13) A remarkable life clumsily told. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | coglemiamiherald.com12/23/2014 Editor rating 2.5 Laura Hillenbrands best-selling book about Louis Zamperini the Olympic runner who survived unbelievable hardships during World War II is a mesmerizing story of courage and perserverance that is impossible to forget. So why does Angelina Jolies film version of Unbroken feel a bit generic? The movie doesnt wander far from its source material though its a necessarily shortened version of Zamperinis ordeal. But somewhere along the way it acquired the predictable grandeur of the biopic and lost some of its realism and urgency. Jolie and the screenwriters -- who include Joel and Ethan Coen -- were almost too reverent with the material recounting Zamperinis life with an awe that belies the amazing true simplicity of what he accomplished He endured. Still theres no denying the elemental appeal of Zamperinis story which in Jolies version starts in the belly of a B-24 on a bombing run over the Pacific. At first the lumbering bomber -- filled with young airmen who have apparently just taken a break from an Abercrombie amp; Fitch photo shoot -- bears up under a barrage of flak. But injuries and problems mount and a safe landing is swiftly in doubt. Unfortunately even before we have a good grasp on which one of these pretty boys is Louis -- hes played by British actor Jack OConnell -- Jolie interrupts the tension of this thrilling opening setpiece to flash back to Louis childhood in southern California. As you might imagine its a lot less compelling than whats going on aboard that plane. Jolie could take a lesson in flashbacks from director Jean-Marc Vallee who used them so formidably in Wild. From its quick start Unbroken founders a bit as we watch the young Louis stealing and smoking and sulking while his father rages and his mother weeps. Hillenbrand documents Louis hoodlum days in her book and Jolie dutifully records them here hinting that his stubbornness will serve him well later. His older brother Pete introduces Louis to the sport of track spouting many platitudes (""If you can take it you can make it"" he tells his little brother and you just know that advice is going to conveniently bolster Louis at a later date). Making a name for himself at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 -- the real Louis actually met Adolf Hitler at the games -- Louis believes his year to compete for the gold will be in 1940. But Germany and Japan have other plans and Louis finds himself stationed in the Pacific where his wartime ordeal begins. There are horrors on the plane on a raft -- scenes that are less powerful than they are in the book because special effects can accomplish many things but creating believable waves is not one of them -- and finally in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp where Louis is terrorized by the camps sadistic leader (Japanese musician Miyavi). Endurance is a difficult concept to show visually so Jolie resorts to the Hollywood moment such as when a filthy starving exhausted Louis is forced to hold a heavy board over his head. If he drops it he dies. Its less a tribute to one mans bravery than a signal to the audience to cheer. The bigger problem is that neither Jolie nor the script bothers to flesh Louis out as a fully formed person with faults and fears and regrets which keeps the film from ever capturing you emotionally. Aside from the liquor he swiped as a kid Louis comes off as noble so extraordinary his survival is a matter of course instead of a hard-fought brutal even lucky victory. But even the most ham-handed filmmaking cant entirely wipe out the wonder of this story. Louis Zamperini died in July of this year at the age of 97 and his brief but startling and moving appearance at the end of the movie reminds you of what he -- and thousands of others -- sacrificed just by being human.

Photo Universal Pictures (c) 2014 Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Unbroken Running time 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. ""Unbroken"" is a cinematic scrapbook a collection of well-composed scenes practically cut and pasted from ""Memphis Belle"" ""Chariots of Fire"" ""Life of Pi"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai."" Unlike those other films though Angelina Jolies second effort as a director is more a series of similar events than a story and lacks an underlying message except that torture hurts. Louis Zamperini was a small-town California boy who won a spot on the US track team at the 1936 Olympics and went on to fly bombers in the Pacific in World War II. Shot down he drifted on a raft in the ocean for 47 days then was taken prisoner by Japan and suffered some more. ""Unbroken"" consists of Louis getting abused in various ways until the war ends and he goes home. Played by a cute but low-octane actor Jack OConnell Zamperini is a passive figure to build a movie around. His only goal is to survive the next beating and Jolies only goal is to watch him bleed. What kind of inner fortitude delivered Louie? We dont really know. We learn in passing that he was once skeptical about God became a believer during a storm and vowed to dedicate his life to the Lord. But Jolie is bored by this angle and drops it except as a tease for whatever suckers out there might be fooled into thinking this is a Christian epic. Jolie is far more intrigued by shallow Oprah-style self-help slogans like ""If I can take it I can make it."" On a scene-by-scene basis the film works perfectly well The dogfights at the beginning are vivid hectic unnerving. You can feel the suns talons in the raft with Louie. Finn Witrock (from left) Domhnall Gleeson and Jack OConnell in ""Unbroken.""Photo Universal Pictures (c) 2014 Universal Studios. Yet the film despite its four big-name screenwriters including the Coen brothers is trite (""I got good news and bad news"" Louis chirps to a raft mate when theyre about to be rescued but taken prisoner by the Japanese) and thin of character. Only one man really matters. The others come and go sometimes dying violently with scarcely a shrug on Jolies part. The only two things that interest her are that Zamperini was a victim (lots of scenes of other kids calling him ""dago"" as a child though the real-life Louie was an admitted bully) and that he was a minor celebrity. A very minor one. Does one POWs life really matter more than others because he once finished eighth in an Olympic race? Never mind. On to more torture. Two such scenes are particularly strange In the first the other POWs are for no real reason lined up with orders to smash Louie in the face. Jolie lingers on his bruises but doesnt consider what this might do to a mans psyche -- could you ever trust your mates again even if you knew they were forced to hurt you? Even more odd is Jolies climactic trailer-worthy(tm) moment when Japanese guards order Louie to hoist a huge beam over his head on a promise that hell be shot if he drops it. Since a man who can barely lift a given beam wouldnt be able to hold it overhead for more than a few seconds whats the point of this? If the guard wanted to shoot Louie hed hardly need a beam-lifting challenge for an excuse. Yet Jolie makes it look like Louie held up the beam for a long time that doing so somehow ensured his survival and that every other prisoner in the camp stopped working to gape in admiration. Would the Japanese really allow such a stoppage? And why is Louie so important when weve seen other men die and be instantly forgotten? Shhh. This is Angies Big Movie Moment so lets not ask if it makes sense. The music swells the photography shimmers -- Steven Spielberg looks hard-edged by comparison.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Monday Dec. 22 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Dec. 22 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Angelina Jolie Written by Joel Coen Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson Starring Jack OConnell Domhnall Gleeson and Miyavi Classification 14A Country USA Language English Angelina Jolies second feature as a director following her under-the-radar 2011 Bosnian drama In the Land of Blood and Honey is a beautifully shot well-acted and worthy-to-a-fault Second World War survivor story that only intermittently achieves the kind of emotional impact for which it aims.Adapted from the 2010 bestselling biography by Seabiscuit author Laura Hillenbrand the film follows the life story of Louis Zamperini (1917-2014) an Italian-American whose resilience made him emblematic of the stoical virtues of the ""greatest generation"". Touted as an awards-contender long before its release the films pedigree includes screenwriters Joel and Ethan Coen (along with Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson) the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer Alexandre Desplat. Video Video Angelina Jolie talks personal doubts I wonder if Im good enough Hopes are raised sky-high in the films opening minutes in which we find ourselves riding with ""Louie"" and his crew in a B-24 bomber over the Pacific as it drops its payload on a Japanese target and takes heavy fire from Japanese Zero fighters. This classically shot gripping sequence free from the usual hand-held jumpiness gives us an immediate sense of both the ponderousness of the big plane and the vulnerability of the crew inside.Up in the flak-filled clouds Louis (English actor Jack OConnell) flashes back to his childhood in the 1920s as a scrappy immigrant kid (played by C. J. Valleroy) in Torrance Calif. heading for a life of violence and petty crime. His older brother Pete intervenes teaching Louie (as he prefers to be called) to put his energy onto the running track and advises ""Take it until you make it"" which becomes Louies mantra.He soon develops from town mischief-maker to a track star known as ""the Tornado of Torrance."" At 19 he heads to Berlin to participate in the 1936 Olympics in the 5000-metre race establishing a celebrity that will come back to haunt him a few years later. Hes looking forward to bettering his eighth-place finish at Tokyo in 1940 but then the war provides a new challenge.When Louies plane crash-lands into the Pacific only three of the 11 crew members survive Louie with his wounded pilot (Domhnall Gleeson) and gunner (Finn Wittrock). They have two joined rubber life rafts exposed to sharks from below and Japanese dive-bombers from above. After 47 days in the open boats only Louie and the pilot are alive when the Japanese pick them up and deliver them to a POW camp.This period in the camp covers most of the films last hour and revolves around Louies confrontation with camp sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Japanse pop star Miyavi). The sergeant known as ""the Bird"" is an unremitting sadist who recognizes Zamperinis celebrity and makes it a mission to break his star prisoner.These scenes are unflinching as Louie and the other prisoners-of-war have been starved down to skeletal proportions. As he is pounded with kendo sticks and repeatedly punched by fellow prisoners on Watanabes orders you imagine his spindly frame will snap in pieces. OConnell (a veteran the popular British teen series Skins) does a terrific job not only with the physical demands of the role but in showing Louies attempts to disguise his fear through his eyes and muscle-tensing whenever Watanabe approaches him. In one poignantly understated scene he is allowed to deliver a measured radio message to his family assuring them that he is being treated ""well"" given wartime conditions.Jolies scrupulous avoidance to melodrama is admirable though she takes directorial restraint to an extreme - perhaps in deference to the stoical Zamperini who died in July at the age of 97. The price is a failure of dramatic interest in repeated scenes of Watanabes cruelty and Louies endurance. What if anything did this suffering mean?Not until the films postscript do you get to appreciate the larger arc of Zamperinis life that makes his story not just harrowing but surprising and inspiring. In a few lines of text in the afterword the movie covers the years of his post-traumatic stress his embrace of Christianity and lifelong mission of forgiveness and reconciliation with his former tormentors. Either Unbroken needed to be two hours longer to to explore Louies spiritual growth or perhaps it should have started at the point where Jolies film ends.

Photo Credit AP / David James advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of Olympic runner and World War II survivor Louis Zamperini. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Well-crafted and compelling but director Angelina Jolies best contribution was casting the unknown Miyavi in a pivotal role. CAST Jack OConnell Miyavi Domhnall Gleeson LENGTH 217 The posters and trailers for Angelina Jolies ""Unbroken"" have positioned the movie as a story of survival. Its hero is Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini an Italian-American who showed early potential as an Olympic runner but like so many of his generation put his life on hold to serve in World War II. The horrors he endured are chronicled in Laura Hillenbrands book which became the basis for Jolies film. Any segment of Zamperinis three-act tale could make its own movie. (The straight-ahead script is written partly by the Coen brothers.) As a troubled kid in Torrance California Zamperini (initially played by C.J. Valleroy) turned his life around by running track and eventually raced in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. advertisement | advertise on newsday When America entered the war Zamperini (now played by newcomer Jack OConnell) became a bombardier on a B-24 Liberator that crashed into the Pacific leaving only him and two others to drift on rafts. After 47 grueling days -- and some of the films most gripping scenes -- Zamperini announces ""I have good news and bad news."" Their rescuers are Japanese. To this point ""Unbroken"" has been a handsomely directed but slightly aimless film. The acting has ranged from very fine (Domhnall Gleeson plays Zamperinis fellow soldier Phil Allen) to passable (OConnell never quite comes into focus). Things change dramatically with the introduction of Mutsuhiro Watanabe a notorious prison-camp commander known as ""The Bird."" Jolie gives this pivotal role to a 33-year-old rock singer Miyavi who is virtually unknown outside Japan. She may have gotten the idea from 1983s ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" which likewise cast pop musician Ryuichi Sakamoto as a Japanese camp commandant but she clearly found the right man for the role. MoviesAngelina Jolie movies Miyavis performance is astounding. Effeminate and strangely sensual he slips effortlessly between various psychotic personae -- tyrant sadist sycophant -- and in the end becomes the films most fascinating figure. Once ""Unbroken"" finds its villain in Watanabe Zamperini finds his purpose and the movie comes alive. advertisement | advertise on newsday The closing titles which explain the fates of both men in the aftermath of the war help put Zamperinis remarkable story into a larger and more meaningful context.

"Unbroken review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Unbroken Unbroken Universal Pictures Jack OConnell in ""Unbroken."" Jack OConnell in ""Unbroken."" (Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Grueling doesnt always equal gripping as proven by Angelina Jolies biopic of WWII POW Louis Zamperini. Laura Hillenbrands 2010 nonfiction account ""Unbroken"" introduced millions to Louis Zamperini the Italian-American who competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and in World War II became an Army Air Corps bombardier flying missions over the South Pacific. In 1943 Zamperini was aboard a rickety B-24 aircraft the ""Green Hornet"" when it crashed in the water. He and two other survivors ""Phil"" Phillips and ""Mac"" McNamara survived 33 days on a life raft contending with Japanese bomber strafings and killer sharks.McNamara didnt make it to day 34 but Zamperini and Phillips eked out two more weeks at sea only to be captured by the enemy. Then until the end of the war Zamperini was tortured by his captors chiefly the Japanese prison commander known as ""The Bird"" (played by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi). Hillenbrands title which is also the title of director Angelina Jolies film version indicates a hard-won triumph. Zamperini survived these ordeals and lived to age 97. Jolies version of the story solidly crafted if slightly hollow comes from a script by Joel and Ethan Coen based on earlier drafts by Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Jack OConnell gives his all as Zamperini. (In the forthcoming and excellent Belfast Ireland-set film ""71"" OConnell plays another military man in a life-and-death nightmare.)""Unbroken"" makes for a grueling experience which is not quite the same as a memorable one. Jolies previous directorial effort the Bosnian War drama ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" announced a filmmaker of moral seriousness as well as technical prowess. Both are fully on view in ""Unbroken"" but theres something aggressively Hollywood-y about it. For better or worse Jolie -- who worked with Clint Eastwood as his leading actress in ""Changeling"" -- favors director Eastwoods style of square on-the-nose and visually uncomplicated storytelling. The courage and swagger under fire in ""Unbroken"" seems more like the movies than real life. Cinematographer Roger Deakins among the best in the world treats each new shot as an improbably pretty picture the lighting just so the shadows and silhouettes beautiful even when the circumstances are grim beyond measure. Its the same with the music Composer Alexandre Desplats orchestral flourishes have a way of distancing and falsifying Zamperinis ordeal. When Mac (Finn Wittrock) receives his burial at sea its strange to be thinking about other matters such as how much more effective the scene might be without mood music behind it. Latest movies reviewedOpen link I wonder if Jolies formidable often fearsomely intense work as an actress has affected her way of seeing and framing other peoples stories. Often in ""Unbroken"" the camera glides in slowly in mythic mode while OConnell holds a pose unblinking stalwart unbroken. Zamperini is less a dimensional character in the film than he is a superhuman lesson in affirmation against all odds. Zamperinis postwar ordeal his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder his relationship to religion All that messy complex business is handled abruptly in a few quick title cards just before the end credits. Rightly Jolie didnt want to tell the mans entire life story. But as is at too-convenient dramatic junctures the screenplay darts back into flashbacks of Zamperinis childhood or young adulthood when we should really be sticking with the crisis at hand.""Unbroken"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for war violence including intense sequences of brutality and for brief language)Running time 217Opens Thursdaymjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Angelina Jolie Reviews Clint Eastwood Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese In the Land of Blood and Honey (movie) Review Into the Woods Review Big Eyes Review Mr. Turner Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-unbroken-review-20141222-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,unbroken24,unbroken,chicagotribune

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Jack OConnell evokes Louis Zamperinis suffering and portrays his impossible will to survive in the face of great misfortune and cruelty. (Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan December 22 2014 The most surprising thing about the sturdy if slightly starchy storytelling of ""Unbroken"" is that it comes courtesy of director Angelina Jolie an artist never known for constraint in front of the camera. The actresss sophomore effort as a feature filmmaker after 2011s ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is impeccably acted handsomely filmed and written with a lean muscularity by a quartet of heavyweights including Joel and Ethan Coen (""Inside Llewyn Davis"") Richard LaGravenese (""Behind the Candelabra"") and William Nicholson (""Mandela Long Walk to Freedom""). But it is also stiff-legged if not exactly stodgy. It struggles to break out of the pack of prestigious awards-season films in which it hunts. Based on Laura Hillenbrands 2010 bestseller about Olympic runner Louis Zamperini who was held prisoner by the Japanese during World War II the film is stirring when it needs to be and often even thrilling. The scenes of aerial combat that open the film and later those set at sea where Louis a bombardier spent more than six weeks on a raft after his B-24 crashed in the Pacific are particularly gripping. The main body of the tale which concerns Louiss torture at the hands of a sadistic prison commander -- played with creepy almost psychotic intensity by Japanese rock star Takamasa Ishihara who performs under the name Miyavi -- is even more harrowing. At the same time Jolies approach to the enterprise is unexpectedly by-the-book. The score by Alexandre Desplat (who also worked this year alone on ""The Imitation Game"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" ""Godzilla"" and ""The Monuments Men"") is effective yet vaguely mushy. It sounds like the button-pushing aural backdrop to any number of other poignant period films. One scene near the end -- in which Louis is forced to carry a heavy beam on his shoulders making him look like Christ on the cross -- makes such an obvious allusion to a crucifix shown early in the film that its borderline cloying. As Louis the English-Irish actor Jack OConnell is pretty great both at evoking the characters suffering and at rendering Louiss adamantine even impossible will to survive in the face of great misfortune and cruelty. Enduring 47 days on a raft -- during which time he and two other downed crew members (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock) managed mostly to live on fish seagull and shark meat -- would be substance enough for one film. Yet Louiss ordeal is only beginning when he is found half dead by the Japanese. Produced and directed by Angelina Jolie ""Unbroken"" tells the dramatic story of Louis Zamperini (played by Jack OConnell) an Olympic runner who was taken prisoner by Japanese forces during World War II. (Universal) Jolie is no slouch as a filmmaker. Aided by the Coen brothers go-to cinematographer Roger Deakins whose credits stretch from beyond the gritty 1986 ""Sid and Nancy"" to last years eerie and underappreciated ""Prisoners"" she has limned Zamperinis real-life tale with a kind of begrimed beauty and painful power. The truest testament to the films strength is the degree to which it all but achieves greatness. One cant help but wish that ""Unbroken"" was a bit less reverent about its subject. Sourness for the sake of sourness isnt whats needed here. ""Unbroken"" may not exactly be mired in sanctimony but its standing almost up to its ankles in an unhealthy sense that its subject -- about whose simple humanity the film otherwise goes to great lengths to illuminate -- is a candidate for sainthood.

As other films premiered at festivals in late summer and early fall Unbroken held out the tantalizing inevitability of gravity and grandeur the true tale of Louis Zamperini Olympic runner and war survivor directed by Angelina Jolie. For many reviewers the build-up led to a big breakdown when they finally saw it. Unbroken was just... a movie. So far it has snagged no top prizes from the critics groups and was shut out of the Golden Globe nominations -- though its star Jack OConnell took Best Newcomer awards from the New York Film Critics Online and the National Board of Review. Many reviewers compared the movie unfavorably with the Laura Hillenbrand best-seller on which it was based. And some of the early notices were on the peckish side. ""An interminable redundant unnecessary epic"" wrote The New Yorkers David Denby ""devoted to suffering suffering suffering."" Real moviegoers get to choose their own epithets starting Christmas Day when the movie opens. So where does Unbroken fit on the spectrum of anticipation and disillusion? Id say closer to the top. Its a big confident film that tries to tell an impossibly broad anecdotal story -- for Zamperini who died in July at 97 had already lived three lives before he was 30. This American son of Italian immigrants finished eighth in the 5000-meter race at the 1936 Berlin Olympics (Hitler dropped by to congratulate him); survived the crash of his B-24 as a bombardier in the Pacific War and spent 47 days near starvation on a life raft; was captured by the Japanese sent to a prison camp and for two years suffered the personal torture of the sadist in charge. He came home fell into alcoholism got born again with the encouragement of Billy Graham and spent the rest of his life proselytizing. If Peter Jackson had taken on the project Unbroken would have spanned nine installments. Jolies version from an uncharacteristically straightforward script by Joel and Ethan Coen takes Zamperini through the end of World War II. We get the Olympics the raft ordeal and the prison camp -- in movie terms Chariots of Fire plus Life of Pi plus The Bridge on the River Kwai. Also theres a little backstory of his youth in Torrance Cal. where Louie deflected bullies taunting by focusing on his track skills. In these early scenes he is prodded toward respectability and greatness by his brother Pete (Alex Russell) with inspirational bromides like ""If you can take it you can make it"" and ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"" -- cliches that will become life-saving mantras in Louies times of unbearable stress. Jolie begins with a superbly choreographed B-24 raid over the Pacific -- pellucid morning sky heavenly choir the ack-ack of enemy fire -- with Louie as the bombardier. Having returned to base landing on a flat tire he and his men are given an old rat trap of a warplane. Says one of his pals ""This is like sittin in the living room tryin to fly my house."" On May 27 1943 that plane got shot down with only three survivors Louie Capt. ""Phil"" Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and tail gunner ""Mac"" McNamara (Finn Wittrock). On their raft they have few supplies and less hope living off shark meat and Louies indomitable will. The movies third and longest section is in the Omori POW camp outside Tokyo where Louie attracts the depraved attention of Sgt. Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara the singer known as Miyavi in his first movie role). A preening dandy Watanabe has enough command of English to hurt Louie with words as well as his riding crop. He issues contradictory commands -- ""Look at me"" ""Dont look at me"" -- each earning a whack on Louies legs or torso. Like many criminal sadists he blames his victim for all malevolence ""Why do you let me hit you?"" And whack again. A dominatrix surrounded by helpless starving men Watanabe could be a metaphor for the Japanese camp officials and their brutality (much more than that of their German counterparts) toward the soldier-prisoners in their charge. Jolie doesnt exploit the cruelty for shock value; her approach is cinematically fastidious. And Miyavis boldly alluring performance turns Watanabe into a fascinating example of the sort of sado-monster who can flourish in war or peace. Out of one camp and in early 1945 into another Louie finds his old psycho nemesis awaiting him. Watanabe has dreamed up a new game Louis must hold a heavy board on his shoulders for hours with his guards told ""If he drops it shoot him."" This scene -- its in all the TV spots for Unbroken -- is Louies public Calvary. And unlike Jesus he survives it. If the Unbroken needle stops at Impressive and doesnt quite rise to Enthralling its because Jolie stints on exploring the doubts that tortured Louis nearly as much as Watanabes punishments did and whose details so enriched Hillenbrands biography. Even Jesus in his final hours felt stung by the betrayal of his friends and his Father. Jolies Louis is almost more Christlike than Christ. He remains a man of steel reducing the stakes from ""Will he crack?"" to ""How will he endure?"" Since we know Louis outlived his internment the movie relinquishes some of its dramatic tension. So the movie Louis is a traditional movie hero unwavering in his belief ""We win by surviving."" But hes a hero who harbors not vengeance but forgiveness. The real Zamperini returned to Japan after the war to visit his captors and forgive them. Only Watanabe refused a meeting. This decathlon of pain demands an actor who can portray not just the horror of Louiss plight but his supernal will to overcome it. OConnell the 24-year-old Anglo-Irishman who made a splash as the teenager in prison with his even more violent dad in Starred Up is up to the challenge of inhabiting Louis over a decade of his young manhood -- 10 years that seemed like a lifetime and death-time. Jolie has made a grand solid movie of the Zamperini story but OConnell is the part of Unbroken that was truly worth the wait. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Jack OConnell portrays Olympian and war hero Louis Zamperini who was imprisoned in a Japanese prison camp in ""Unbroken."" Photo Handout / McClatchy-Tribune News Service ""Unbroken"" review Angelina Jolies uneven second effort 1 / 3 Back to Gallery One of these days Angelina Jolie might very well direct a great movie. She has a rare talent and intense concerns and interests. But first she is going to have to suppress some self-defeating impulses that have now twice taken potentially effective films and rendered them ridiculous. Her first film ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" which she also wrote turned the Bosnian war into a chamber drama about sadomasochism. Jolie didnt write ""Unbroken"" which had a good sign in that the Coen brothers were among the four screenwriters who adapted Laura Hillenbrands book and yet somehow Jolie still turns this into another intimate story of eroticism distorted by power. Its still too early to say whether Jolies interest in sadomasochism is a matter of artistic obsession or just her reflexive metaphor for abuse in general. But one does get the feeling that if she ever makes a movie about the Civil War Lincoln will be wearing leather. ""Unbroken"" is the story of Louis Zamperini which is several times over a tale of survival. Born to a family of Italian immigrants he made the U.S. track team in the 1936 Olympics and even met Hitler. During World War II he served on a bombing crew in the Pacific and got through things that would have broken another person. He was blessed with a positive temperament basically a sunny person but one with an all-important streak of defiance. If you have any doubt about Jolies potential as a director just watch the opening sequence in which Louis and his crew participate in a bombing raid. Its the kind of scene we all know from countless war movies but this time its different. Theres the sound of the plane and the tension of the men as they get closer to the drop site. Theres the antiaircraft fire little red and purple explosions popping almost gently below and to the side of them. Rarely in such scenes do you ever feel the vulnerability of being in the middle of the sky getting shot at. Jolie makes you feel it by never leaving the inside of that plane. So when Japanese fighter planes suddenly appear on all sides they are seen through every window and the feeling is one of panic and hopelessness. As is typical of movies these days ""Unbroken"" leaves this moment of peak tension for a flashback. No one watching a great scene has ever thought ""What Id really like right now is a flashback."" And yet this is happening more and more Movies begin with something exciting only to reveal that theyre merely offering the promise of excitement later. First we must go back in time to something uninteresting something wed just as soon skip. We meet Louis as a child and find out how he got interested in running then meet him again as he trains for the Olympics. By now hes played by Jack OConnell an English actor who looks about as Italian as Benedict Cumberbatch. Zamperini didnt win a medal at the Olympics but he was expected to really come into his own in 1940. Unfortunately the world was otherwise engaged by then and in 1941 Zamperini enlisted in the Air Force. Although so much of this story is part of the public record its probably best not to go into detail about Zamperinis wartime exploits except to say that he ended up in a Japanese prison camp where he became a particular target of a sadistic guard. This is where ""Unbroken"" starts to derail. Though any director would have to account for the torments Zamperini suffered not every director would just linger and linger on these beatings. A good 45 minutes of the movie consists of showing Louis getting beaten up then healing; getting beaten up then healing over and over. It was also Jolies decision to add an erotic component by casting Takamasa Ishihara as the guard an actor who is as smooth-faced and pretty as any actress. She has Ishihara play these scenes as though hes secretly in love with Zamperini. And then she adds a note of the (unintentionally) absurd when she has the actors through their performances suggest some kind of unspoken communication almost a communion between the tortured and the torturer. This was silly enough when she did it in ""In the Land of Blood and Honey."" By now its getting silly and weird. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres some stark poetry in the opening scenes of Angelina Jolies befuddling World War II biopic suggesting that the actress-turned-director is attempting to unearth her inner Ida Lupino. With barely any introduction Jolie drops viewers onto an American bombardier flying a mission over the coastal waters of Japan. A beautifully visualized aerial battle ensues (what else do you hire cinematographer Roger Deakins for if not pretty pictures?) during which attention is drawn among all the strangely model-attractive soldiers to Louis Zamperini (Jack OConnell). What makes him so special? Cue flashback.Those who have read Laura Hillenbrands bestselling 2010 non-fiction book Unbroken A World War II Story Of Survival Resilience And Redemption on which the movie is based (the script was worked on by the curious quartet of Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson) will know Zamperinis history. This son of Italian immigrants was a frequent target of bullies in his adolescence and found an outlet on the school track team. He was a natural runner and became one of the youngest-ever Americans to qualify for the Olympics in the sport. He competed in Germany in 1936 and made a strong showing. An awestruck Hitler is even reported to have requested an audience with the young man though the film doesnt dramatize this particular event nor does it bother with the all-American Zamperinis later years when he found God and embarked on what sounds like a stunningly compassionate journey of forgiveness.What it does show primarily and endlessly are brutal scenes from Zamperinis WWII military career during which in Jolies telling he becomes a huddled-masses messiah. During a bombardier mission Zamperini and his crew crash-landed in the middle of the ocean. He survived 47 days at sea--subsisting on a diet of raw fish and albatross while avoiding constantly circling sharks--only to be captured by the Japanese army and interned in several prisoner-of-war camps. It was during this period that he was tortured with great frequency by a vicious prison guard named Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe (played as a fey closet case by Japanese pop star Miyavi). And its these penitentiary sequences--very Bridge On The River Kwai with mincing sadomasochistic overtones--that Jolie wants the audience to remember.Theres a dissertation to be written on Unbrokens campy fascination with supple male flesh and its mortification. Every one of the prisoners is movie-star beautiful primped to the gills whether caked in dirt or wasting away from starvation. (When inmate Garrett Hedlund displays a hand with fingernails ripped away its as if hes modeling the latest in Paris runway fashion.) OConnells Zamperini meanwhile is the martyr who takes the majority of the body blows for and--in one uncomfortably protracted scene--from his countrymen. His master-servant rapport with ""The Bird"" who belittles him with insults and beats him with a bamboo stick is especially strange coming off like a sanitized PG-13 riff on Liliana Cavanis infamous ode to wartime BDSM The Night Porter. Moral and spiritual triumph lie at the end of this hellish gauntlet but though Jolie is shooting for Christ-like passion and redemption she only ends up slathering one mans very real very morbid struggles in the usual reductive ""greatest generation"" sentiment.

Zamperini died of pneumonia in July at 97 but not before Jolie showed him a rough cut of the film on her laptop. In case you never read Unbroken Seabiscuit author Lauren Hillenbrands 2010 bestseller about Louis life heres a quick rundown Raised in Torrance California the son of Italian immigrants Louis was a bad boy destined for jail or worse until his older brother turned him on to running. He was good at it competing in track at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin (Hitler noticed him). During World War II he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. When his B-24 went down in the Pacific Louis survived on a life raft for a scarifying 47 days until he and others were captured by the Japanese then starved and tortured for two years in a POW camp.

But Jolie wisely ends her film with the war which still leaves enough material to fill a miniseries or two. Hillenbrands critics accuse her of riding the surface of Louis blatantly inspirational tale. Jolie working from a script polished by no less than the Coen brothers needed to dig deeper meaning she had to find the right actor to play Louis. Her choice Jack OConnell justifies her faith. OConnell (Starred Up) is a British dynamo with a true actors instinct for getting inside a characters head. On the raft with fellow airmen Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock) its Louis who musters a glimmer of hope while sharks circle as relentlessly as despair. OConnell makes us see how hard-won that hope is. In only her second feature as director following 2011s Bosnian drama In the Land of Blood and Honey Jolie shows remarkable confidence and compassion. She excels in the vicious camp scenes (PG-13 pushed to the limit) in which Louis meets Watanabe a.k.a. the Bird a sadist guard whose love/hate for the Olympic athlete is chillingly pervy. Japanese rock star Miyavi (born Takamasa Ishihara) plays his first screen role with mesmeric brilliance making the Birds physical elegance a striking contrast to the savagery of his inhuman punishment. Unbroken is beautifully crafted even in its brutality. A sequence near wars end when Louis and the POWs are herded to a river expecting to be murdered en masse is memory-scarring. Jolie has an army of craftsmen in her corner notably camera poet Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men). But its her vision that gives Unbroken a spirit that soars.

"Unbroken | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unbroken ) Unbroken (United States 2014) December 22 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Angelina Jolies sophomore effort as a director is a high-profile adaptation the true-life book Unbroken (written by Laura Hillenbrand the author of Sea Biscuit). Those unaware that the film is based on historical events might understandably assume it to be an updated version of the Bibles ""Book of Job."" Indeed its hard to imagine someone suffering more forcefully than Olympian Louis Zamperini (Jack OConnell) whose ordeals during the 1940s might be summarized by an extension of a familiar cliche ""Out of the frying pan into the fire and back into the frying pan again."" In the short space of a few months he is nearly shot out of the sky while engaged in a bombing mission lives through a plane crash spends six weeks with two companions adrift in a life raft on the Pacific (with little food and water and sharks never far away) and endures a stint in a Japanese prisoner of war camp where his status as a ""celebrity"" makes him a target. As the title indicates he comes through all this bowed but unbroken. Jolies account is mostly accurate but coldly clinical. The story is effective in relaying Zamperinis narrative but lacks both the gut punch one often gets from prisoner-of-war narratives and the full catharsis one expects at the end. Its emotionally distant as if Jolie is reluctant to explore the distress that might come from a close bond between the viewer and the character. Its hard to determine whether the primary fault lies in her directorial choices or in the screenplay which was re-written by the Coen Brothers from material developed by Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. This is only the third time the Coens have scripted something they havent directed and one wonders whether their take on the material might not have translated when shepherded to the screen by another filmmaker. Whatever the reason however Unbrokens impact is muted. Still theres a lot to like about the movie. Its presentation is straightforward chronicling Zamperinis amazing tale without flinching. The pace is brisk allowing the films 137 minutes to pass smoothly; it never overstays its welcome. The acting is strong across-the-board and there arent any too-familiar faces to jar viewers out of the overall experience. (Unlike Brad Pitts small part in 2013s Oscar-winner 12 Years a Slave.) Jack OConnells performance is strong and the portrayal of Miyavi as Mutsushiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe the sadistic commander of the camp bubbles with malice. Hes the kind of villain an audience can relish hating and whose inhumanity elevates Zamperinis struggle. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is top notch with some of the aerial scenes rivaling those of the best war films. Unbroken is probably headed for some degree of Oscar consideration and Deakins work should be acknowledged with a nomination. The period detail is strong and although the prison camp looks much like every other prison camp to have appeared in movies since the 1940s it emphasizes the bleakness of the situation for those trapped there. Although the production boasts a serious tone (as befits a story of this nature) there are times when the Coens gallows humor peeks through. For example when rescue finally arrives after weeks on the high seas it comes at the hands of the Japanese. Zamperini announces the situation to his surviving companion (played by Domhall Gleeson) ""Ive got some good news and some bad news..."" For Jolie making Unbroken was an undisputed labor of love; she fought hard for the opportunity. Its an ambitious undertaking for someone with only one previous film under her belt (2011s In the Land of Blood and Honey) - perhaps too ambitious. Jolies documentary-inspired approach has its share of strengths and drawbacks. The former make Unbroken a good film while the latter prevent it from attaining greatness.

Theres something curiously airless about director Angelina Jolies Unbroken the story of real-life Olympian and World War II POW Louis Zamperini. Early on Louis (Jack OConnell) and his fellow American soldiers are zipping through the golden skies dogfighting with Japanese planes and although the B-24s doors are open and the wind is wild their hair is perfectly in place. When shot the men do not bleed. When they die their corpses smile. When enemy planes explode they do so in glorious puffs. The effect is applause-worthy and antiseptic -- a war film that wants to sell bleach. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Unbroken is the most literal film of the year -- its wholly the tale of a victim who wont crack. Make that three films -- it plays like several shorts edited end-to-end. The first takes place during the Dust Bowl which you can tell because of all the visible dust. This segment is a cheery tale of an immigrant boy made good a kiddie thug (C.J. Valleroy plays young Louis) who sneaks booze into milk bottles and goes home to a dear Italian mamma who makes gnocchi from scratch and prays for his soul. Louis gets his life on track only when his older brother Pete (Alex Russell) encourages him to run. Louis is a natural setting high school records without breaking a sweat racing the fastest lap at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later continuing to train even during the war while stationed in the Pacific where he optimistically hopes hell return to show off his 412 mile in the Tokyo Olympics. (Jokes a fellow soldier ""I hope youre not that fast in the sack."")The second and third acts are nightmares. On a routine rescue mission Louis plane crashes into the ocean killing eight of the 11 men aboard. We gasp when we see his leg pinned under fuselage -- will he ever race again? Very quickly its clear that winning a gold medal is the least of his problems. Jolie settles into the survivors raft for a long stretch at sea where unlike the high-flying heroics of the opening scrap we feel every creak and breeze. (Curiously the facial hair of the three men remains tidy -- after weeks afloat they sport neat Errol Flynn mustaches.)Film Details Unbroken RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time137 min. More Info Trailer Its miserable stuff a total tonal shift and I havent even mentioned the sharks. Yet it gets even worse when the boys are scooped up by the Japanese and shoved into separate POW camps. (Groans Louis at their rescue ""Ive got good news and bad news."") What follows is unceasing torture on screen and vicariously in the theater. At the hands of pretty-boy war criminal Mutsushiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) the Americans are beaten and beaten and beaten. The techniques might differ a nose broken here fingernails yanked there and a whirligig wrencher where Louis is punched by literally every Yankee in the barracks absolving them even as they bust his eye sockets.

But were no closer to figuring out the point of Unbroken other than to marvel at Louis strength. Undoubtedly the real Louis Zamperini was a true hero -- a word also used to describe American Snipers Chris Kyle shooting up 160 Iraqis one theater away. Yet what makes Zamperini a role model isnt his appetite for death its his gift of forgiveness. After a full hour of POW torture with enough blood and bruises to make even modern pacifists want to build a time machine and avenge themselves on the Imperial Japanese Army Jolie lets us know in a crawl that after Zamperini was freed in 1945 he went home found God and returned to Japan five years later where he embraced his former captors. Now that takes courage.Yet Jolie is more fixated on gore than grace. In making us feel every crushing blow -- the better to burnish her reputation as a serious director -- were shortchanged on the beauty of Zamperinis story and we exit blinking into the theater lobby with our hands still clenched in fists. Unbroken wants it all the big cinematography the close-up grit the postcard flashbacks and the grisly Gotterdammerung that earns directors awards. But it aches for a lighter touch -- the facts of Zamperinis life more than stand on their own.Still in the lead role OConnell is an excellent punching bag. He has the look of St. Sebastian all model cheekbones and misery. Many of the humans here feel like props but when the camera pans over OConnell he confidently stares back.Over and over he repeats a mantra learned from his older brother ""If I can take it I can make it."" Alas Jolie seems to have reversed his words. Shes got the clout to make anything but with a story this powerful just getting it made isnt enough.UNBROKEN | Directed by Angelina Jolie | Written by Joel Coen Ethan Cohen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson based on the book by Laura Hillenbrand | Universal Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

A WWII airman faces incredible challenges. Director Angelina Jolie. (218) PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. Opens Wednesday night. Almost 40 minutes into Angelina Jolies ""Unbroken"" a soldier named Louis Zamperini needs desperately to fall back on advice he heard in church as a boy ""Do not fear the night."" The need to keep focused in the worst of times kicks in for us too because thats when this extraordinary hard-hitting film stars to put viewers through the wringer. When you get through it though you cant help but feel uplifted by this tough-skinned movie that can stand with the best muscular wartime dramas in the American movie canon. Zamperini (Jack OConnell) -- or Zam as his pal Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) calls him -- is a bombardier during WWII. Hes already escaped life as a roustabout youth in Torrance Calif. by becoming a high-school runner. That led to fame as the fastest American in the 5000-meter dash at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Jack OConnell as World War II airman Louis Zamperini and Miyavi as the commander of a POW camp (universal) While on a rescue run over the Pacific in 1943 Zamperinis plane has mechanical trouble and crashes into the ocean killing the whole crew except for Louis Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock). They wind up adrift on a raft for 47 days facing sharks starvation and enemy fire barely surviving on the few fish they catch with their bare hands and the drops of rain they catch in their mouths. Then the lost airmen are found -- but by the Japanese. That begins more than two years of nightmares at POW camps and run-ins with a sadistic young commander named Watanabe (memorably played by the Japanese pop star Miyavi). Forty-seven days on a life raft are just the start of Zamperini and his companions ordeal. (universal) In this story -- adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese (""The Fisher King"") and William Nicholson (""Gladiator"") from Laura Hillenbrands nonfiction bestseller -- Zamperinis tale stands in for military intensity brushed over by ""good war"" simplification. His wartime experiences told almost entirely through action instead of dialogue becomes epic metaphor. When Watanabe singles out ""the Olympic runner"" in the camp -- forcing the POWs to hit Zamperini in the face or making him hold an iron bar aloft lest he be shot -- its a series of pit stops on a journey to hell and back. OConnell an unknown Irish actor gives a gripping nail-biting performance going down to skin and bones while maintaining a proud stoicism. As his antagonist Miyavi is a baby-faced monster weaned on shame and indignity. Theyre caught in Roger Deakins crisp gorgeously old-fashioned cinematography and accompanied by Alexandre Desplaits bold score. Its surprising to find that Jolies sensibilities mesh so well with this old-school saga yet the star-turned-filmmakers second directorial effort more than does justice to her subject. Zamperini who died this year at 97 clearly had a steely ability to withstand worst-case scenarios. ""Unbroken"" asks its audience to do the same and rewards them with an unforgettable return to the light. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Jack OConnell turns in a subtle performance as Olympian and war hero Louis Zamperini in Unbroken.(Photo AP)The extraordinary odyssey of World War II hero Louis Zamperini seems right out of Greek mythology ideal for the big screen.Unbroken is the saga of Zamperinis remarkable courage in the face of staggering adversity. Its an inherently uplifting story as chronicled by Laura Hillenbrand in her 2010 best seller.As directed by Angelina Jolie it is occasionally powerful with soaring visuals. It also is however stately and slow to the point of tedium. (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opening Christmas Day.)USA TODAYUnbroken completes epic journey to screenAnd as is too often the case with the Hollywoodization of exhilarating real-life tales it seeks to render an extraordinary man into a superhero.Jack OConnell is superb as Zamperini bringing restraint and subtlety to a character distinguished by unflagging heroism. Less successful is Japanese pop star Miyavi as the sadistic commander at the prison camp Mutsuhiro Watanabe who brutalizes Zamperini for two years and uses him as a propaganda tool. Miyavis performance is one-dimensional even cartoonish. Their showdowns grow less powerful with repetition slowing the films momentum.Far better is Domhnall Gleeson as Russell ""Phil"" Phillips who in 1943 is marooned on a raft at sea for seven weeks with Zamperini and another soldier after their plane crashes in the Pacific. These make for the films best sequences as the men dodge enemy war planes and take on circling sharks; they feel almost like a separate movie from the second half set in a Japanese POW camp.USA TODAYAngelinas Unbroken takeaway Embrace every dayAs a boy Zamperini was headed toward juvenile delinquency. A petty thief who also stole and imbibed alcohol he was pushed into a healthier pastime by his brother Pete (Alex Russell). The scrawny little kid became a muscular young track star. Eventually named ""the fastest high school runner in U.S. history"" he competed in the 5000-meter race at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.Jolie approaches the story in epic and respectful style. Its a more ambitious work than her modest but engrossing 2011 directorial debut In the Land of Blood and Honey a complicated romance set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War. Yet that intimate drama felt more involving.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Unbroken is based on the true story of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini who survived a near-fatal plane crash in WWII only to be caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. VPCThough co-written by darkly playful writer-director duo Joel and Ethan Coen the Unbroken script is peppered with bland motivational slogans such as ""If you can take it you can make it.""Zamperinis exceptional tale of bravery and resilience should be more heart-wrenching and less Hallmark-flavored. Instead his biography comes across as a conventionally episodic series of ordeals.""The triumph of the human spirit"" has become a cliche in movie-speak. Its too bad that so many films seek to superficially illustrate these conquests since they tend to water down the truly high-stakes accomplishments.Zamperinis path to forgiveness and shunned efforts to make peace with his captors is tacked on in a crawl at the end. Perhaps fewer scenes chronicling his torturous days at the prison camp and a conclusion that included his attempts at reconciliation would have made the story more compelling. A closing shot of the real Zamperini at 80 running at the 1998Olympics in Nagano Japan is deeply moving. He died earlier this year at 97. A documentary featuring his personal recollections might have been more fascinating than this big Hollywood movie. Though OConnells vulnerable lead performance is terrific Unbrokens unrestrained hero worship undermines the story. 31 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/16KfO1t",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/22/unbroken-review/19157145/,200,unbroken33,unbroken,usatoday

With Unbroken her second feature as a director she turns the undeniably inspiring true story of Louie Zamperini into an oddly old-fashioned drama. Its gorgeously shot and beautifully acted and it has moments of heartbreaking poignancy but its also nearly suffocated by its own nobility. Based on Laura Hillenbrands 2010 best-seller Unbroken chronicles the extraordinary life of a man who grew up as the hell-raising son of Italian immigrants ran for the U.S. at the 1936 Olympics and was shot down over the Pacific in WWII. The story adapted by a small army of A-list writers (Richard LaGravenese William Nicholson and Joel and Ethan Coen) kicks off with a dizzying sense of immediacy. Were thrown right into the belly of a B-24 bomber as Zamperini (British actor Jack OConnell) and his crew take fire from Japanese fighters. Its a hell of an opening sequence. But then Jolie downshifts flashing back to Zamperinis childhood and the film loses its steam as Louies older brother spouts portentous cliches (""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"") intended to get him to make something of himself. It works. Louie becomes a high school track star whos headed to the Olympics. Meanwhile to signal to the audience to sit tight Jolie keeps cutting back to the B-24 as if to say ""Dont worry the good stuffs coming."" When the film finally does catch up to Louies ditch into the ocean it finds its harrowing groove again. Louie and two other survivors (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock) scramble into a raft where they try to fight off the sun sharks and starvation. Discovered by the enemy after 47 days Louie is sent to a Japanese prison camp run by a sadistic warden (Miyavi) who singles him out for torture. And Jolie whos learned a thing or two about the inexplicable horrors of war in her work with the U.N. doesnt skimp on Louies abuse. Still theres a strange feeling of both too much and not enough with Unbroken. OConnell a real star on the rise who bristled with mad-dog menace in the recent prison drama Starred Up is totally hypnotic. And the physical deprivation he underwent for the role is impressive. I just wish that Jolies film had the same rawness. Instead its moving admirable and occasionally exhilarating. What its missing is the one thing that could always be counted on with Jolie as a star the spark of danger.

The great young Irish actor Jack OConnell stars as the American Olympic runner Louis Zamperini who survives forty-seven days in the Pacific on a raft after his B-24 ditches in 1942. Zamperini then spends three years in Japanese prison camps where he is beaten again and again and endures one grotesque punishment in which the entire population of prisoners one after another must punch him in the face. You feel like yelling ""Cut"" to the director Angelina Jolie who confuses long scenes of sadism with truth-telling. OConnells tormenter is a repressed homosexual (Miyavi the smooth-faced Japanese pop star) who loves Zamperini and cant stop attacking him--a tired trope from the Freudian Hollywood of the forties. In large set pieces Jolie is more than competent but the movie feels derivative and short of ideas other than the notion that endurance makes a man great. With Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund as fellow-prisoners. Joel Coen Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson worked on the script based on Laura Hillenbrands 2010 best-seller.

Why has it taken so long for Hollywood to make a film about the incredible life of Louis Zamperini? Angelina Jolies third film as a director is a gorgeously shot and hardhitting old-school war drama thats meant to leave us awestruck by the power of the human spirit. It gets so much right - but still somehow fails to get under Zamperinis skin.Jack OConnells scrappy underdog energy is perfect for Zamperini who we meet at 26 in a gripping scene as he shoots at the Japanese from a B-24 bomber in 1943. In flashbacks we see him as a juvenile delinquent the son of poor Italians tearing around California. When little Louis age 13 or so discovers theres more to running than dodging cops he quits booze and fags to train with his brother. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics he catches Hitlers eye as he runs the fastest lap of the 5000-metres race. Is it his athletes iron discipline that keeps Zamperini alive when his plane crashes into the Pacific - and hes stranded on a raft with two buddies? He puts the trio on rations of two squares of chocolate and three sips of water a day. Theres little variety in these scenes although in a shift from the usual macho bravado of men bonding at war Jolie shows us the tenderness of these boys. When one of them gets sick Zam - as his mates call him - holds his hand tenderly telling him stories of his mas gnocchi.Which is enough drama to fill one life - and one film. But theres another act. After 47 days the raft is picked up by a Japanese naval vessel and Zamperini spends the next two years being tortured in a POW camp by a deranged officer nicknamed The Bird by inmates (played by Japanese popstar Miyavi). The Bird takes a shine to Zamperini and makes a pet of him. But being a psychopathic sadist he has a funny way of showing affection. The violence here is shocking but the Bird is a by-numbers mummys-boy villain (delicate feminine with manicured hands) and after a while he just doesnt feel dangerous. Jolie has assembled an A-list team - Roger Deakins behind the camera the Coen brothers in charge of the script - but while her film is perfectly competent it hardly dazzles. How does a man live through sheer hell and still hang on to a sense of his true self? You wont find the answer here.

The real-life tale spun by ""Unbroken"" definitely rates as quite a yarn but its a testament to director Angelina Jolie and a team of A-list screenwriters (Joel and Ethen Coen Richard La Gravenese William Nicholson adapting the book by ""Seabiscuit"" author Laura Hillenbrand) that it plays out so effectively. Recounting the extraordinary life story of Louis Zamperini (played by Jack OConnell ""Starred Up"") -- who ran for America in the 1936 Olympics survived a plane crash during World War II stayed afloat for 75 days on a life raft before forced internment in a series of Japanese POW camps -- Jolie and company seem to be digging into the Spielberg playbook The movie offers up sun-dappled nostalgia for Depression-era Southern California harrowing wartime sequences and even a shark attack but it serves them all up with maximum efficiency. Also read Angelina Jolie Unveils Unbroken a Grim Inspiring Awards Contender If I describe the superior craftsmanship of ""Unbroken"" -- the stunning cinematography is by the great Roger Deakins Alexandre Desplat composed the soaring score -- in a way that makes the end results seem more like a convertible than a movie its because the film boasts both sheen and efficiency without always delivering an equivalent emotional impact. Its easier to be awed or impressed by it than moved. The stirring opening sequence sees bombardier Zamperini trying to manually close the bomb bay doors as bullets zip through the thin metal wounding and killing his comrades. As pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson ""Frank"") and co-pilot Cup (Jai Courtney ""Jack Reacher"") steer the dying plane to a messy landing Zamperini flashes back to his childhood where as a young truant and petty thief he learned from his older brother that he had a talent for running one that would take him all the way to the Olympics. ""If you can take it you can make it"" his brother tells him and that aphorism seems to be the guiding principle for the amount of pain that Louis endures over the course of the movie. (The other axiom his brother shares is ""One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"" and by the end of the movie Louis has clearly earned several millennia of glory.) The crews next mission is in a ramshackle plane that winds up crashing into the sea where Louis Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock ""American Horror Story"") fight for survival against the elements not to mention hungry sharks for two and a half months before theyre captured by a Japanese troop ship. (In one of the films few laugh lines Louis tells Phil who hasnt seen the ship ""Ive got some good news...and some bad news."") Louis eventually winds up at a prison camp run by a preening sadist known to the men as The Bird (Japanese musician Miyavi making an impressive screen debut) who takes a personal interest in trying to break Louis. When American news sources erroneously report Louis death he gets taken to swanky Radio Tokyo to announce that hes still alive; when he refuses to make anti-American propaganda broadcasts hes returned to The Bird who punishes Louis by making every other imprisoned soldier punch him in the face. While ""Unbroken"" never revels in human suffering it certainly dwells on it in a lingering way. This is a true story after all and Zamperini (who died this year at the age of 97) survived unimaginable horrors but within the context of the film the torture starts feeling repetitive and masochistic. By the time Louis winds up at a forced labor camp also run by The Bird the film feels like its just spinning its wheels and upping the ante of his mental and physical suffering until the eventual Allied victory. Also read Angelina Jolie Unveils Unbroken a Grim Inspiring Awards Contender Jolies directorial debut was the little-seen ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" a film that traded epic sweep for a more intimate but no less brutal story about a womans sexual subjugation during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict. Here shes working on a much larger canvas and putting the pieces together with skill but she seems to have traded in a certain amount of directorial personality in exchange for big and splashy set pieces. There are powerful moments in ""Unbroken"" to be sure but it also feels like the kind of generically grand-scale movie that five other directors could have made in exactly the same way. (Its not unlike Ava DuVernays leap from the indie ""Middle of Nowhere"" to the more sprawling ""Selma."") Also read Angelina Jolie Plans to Quit Acting 6 Revelations From Her DuJour Magazine Cover Story (Exclusive Photos) Ultimately the strengths of ""Unbroken"" far outweigh its flaws; given that we know the fate of its protagonist Jolie keeps us engaged in his travails which the similarly-themed ""Rosewater"" didnt manage to do. Its a handsome production featuring a fine ensemble (that also includes Garrett Hedlund) who remain on-point through what must have been difficult filming circumstances as well as a potent reminder that the Second World War for all the glamorizing it endured over the ensuing decades was as horrifying and devastating as any other conflict in human history. If nothing else ""Unbroken"" may set the stage for an even greater third film for Jolie one that marries her first projects soul with her latest movies scope. Whatever else this impressive sophomore feature at its best stands as a stirring sweeping and lacerating tale of one mans superhuman endurance. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Jack OConnell is a pleasure to watch in Angelina Jolies accomplished second outing as a director A great true story is telescoped down to a merely good one in Unbroken. After a dynamite first half-hour Angelina Jolies accomplished second outing as a director slowly loses steam as it chronicles the inhuman dose of suffering endured by Olympic runner Louie Zamperini in Japanese internment camps during World War II. Wonderfully acted by Jack OConnell in the leading role and guided with a steady hand by Jolie without unduly inflating the heroics or injecting maudlin cliches this will be a tough film for some to take. But it also has strong appeal as an extraordinary survival story and Laura Hillenbrands first-rate book which inspired it has not been on the best-seller lists for four years for nothing. A robust box-office future should be in store at home and abroad. Jolies spectacularly noncommercial first feature the 2011 Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey nonetheless proved that she could direct an assertion more than confirmed by the vivid you-are-there opening of Unbroken. Without preamble the film puts you on board a B-24 one of many sent out on a U.S. bombing raid of a Japanese-held island in the Pacific. Theres a real sense of the heaviness of the metal that somehow defies gravity as it grinds through the air as well as an intense awareness of how all the men from the guys in the cockpit to the exposed gunners in their turrets to the bombardier Zamperini depend upon each other to do their jobs. And as the fast Zeroes approach and start firing on the Americans the sound and speed of events are both pulse-quickening and sobering reminders of how arbitrary life and death are in combat. Read more Unbroken Unveiled Angelina Jolies War Pic Finally Arrives Speed in fact is the essence of Zamperinis life to which flashbacks to his youth in Torrance Southern California attest. A little Italian-speaking troublemaker during the Depression young Louie (a likeable C.J. Valleroy) is pushed by his older brother Pete (first John DLeo then Alex Russell) to take up track where he becomes such a sensation that he eventually makes the 1936 U.S. Olympic team. The scene of the Americans race there is exciting but for some reason Jolie decided to forgo the ""Hitler moment"" that will be remembered by readers of the book wherein the Fuhrer and Louie had a brief encounter. Perhaps the director decided this would be distracting but its hard not to feel it as a missed opportunity in that Louie was actually face-to-face with the man who would set off the firestorm that would soon engulf him and the rest of the world. The brilliantly staged crippled landing of the initial bombing expedition spookily foreshadows a second flight a search for lost fliers in a patched together plane that in a harrowing scene makes a crash landing and breaks up in the middle of the Pacific. The only survivors are Louie his blond pilot buddy Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and a new crewman they dont really know Mac (Finn Wittrock) who array themselves on two yellow life rafts and hope for the best. The least one can say is that their experience is rather more mundane than but perhaps equally perilous to that of the solitary lad lost at sea in Life of Pi. As the merciless sun bears down the men become crispy red and try to keep talking to maintain their alertness. Sickened by raw gull meat they are sometimes lucky enough to grab the odd sea creature prompting Phil to observe that the Japanese eat their fish raw. Sharks swim menacingly around the rafts and what the men hope is a friendly plane passes by only to reveal itself as Japanese when it strafes them. Mac expires but Louie and Phil manage to last 47 days before being picked up by a Japanese warship. As realistically as the mens deprivations are depicted in the film the half-hour the film spends at sea simply cant render the sheer slow agony the book so effectively conveys --the doubts struggles delirium mood swings surpassing hunger and thirst and constant sense of peril; surprisingly the narrative goes a little slack during this central stretch. Still despite the apparent hopelessness of their situation Louies survivors spirit emerges unmistakably here a tenacious bond with life he wont easily relinquish. Phil has religion to get him through Louie merely the memory of his brothers corny slogan ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory."" Read more Angelina Jolie Brad Pitt Step Out for Unbroken World Premiere in Sydney More than one moment of pain awaits him unfortunately at his next destination a jungle hellhole where he and Phil are stashed in separate cells barely big enough to contain them. Unlike Hillenbrands book the film is unable to convey the staggering misery they were forced to endure in the form of dysentery and other diseases infinitesimal rations enforced silence and perpetual fear. The only sort of punishment Jolie seems confident to present cinematically is of the corporal persuasion which is what Louie encounters repeatedly at the hands of new camp commandant Wantanabe (Miyavi) nicknamed ""The Bird"" a malicious sadist who zeroes in on the athletic American from the outset and never lets up striking him repeatedly with his wooden stick forcing fellow inmates to hit him in the face and otherwise abusing him for reasons both recreational and deeply twisted. The large cell block in the new camp allows its inmates to talk share rumors and otherwise fraternize in a way that takes a lot of the edge off despite their jeopardy. Nothing we see conveys the grave threat the men were constantly under (more than a third of all Allied POWs under the Japanese died in detention compared to only one per cent under the Germans) and the tension is further alleviated by an interesting but comparatively relaxed interlude in which Louie is urged to broadcast on the radio which at least serves the purpose of letting America and his family know that hes still alive. Transferred to yet another camp Louie is pushed to the virtual breaking point leading to a climactic scene which the way Jolie stages it throws off unmistakable crucifixion reverberations. These dont seem specifically warranted by any other internal dramatic factors even if they do in fact relate to the religious conversion Louie underwent postwar but are detailed in the book but are only mentioned onscreen in a passing end title. One other great moment from the book that oddly doesnt turn up onscreen is the American prisoners noticing a spectacular sight in the far distance which turns out to be one of the atomic bomb explosions that soon brought the war to an end. Its hard to imagine this wouldnt have made for an arresting even surreal visual interlude. Read more New York Film Fest 71 Offers Showcase for Unbroken Star Jack OConnell What Jolie succeeds in doing to a substantial degree is representing her heros physical ordeal and his tenacious refusal to give up when it would have been very easy to do so. What she and her more than estimable quarter of screenwriters -- Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson -- have not entirely pulled off is dramatizing the full range of Louies internal suffering emotional responses and survival mechanisms. Nor have they made any of the secondary characters pop from the anonymous background of prisoner extras. In the great old studio days of the 1930s writers directors and and actors knew how to give supporting roles real character and sharp identities within a few seconds; such is emphatically not the case here. Just recently recognized outside the U.K. due to his work in Starred Up and 300 Rise of An Empire OConnell is a pleasure to watch at all times here. He has energy seems watchful and resourceful by instinct is open to others and crucially seems like a man who even when he doesnt necessarily win will nonetheless prevail. Always able to roll with the punches physical and otherwise he looks and sometimes behaves like a lively terrier. The flashy role of the dreaded Bird is charismatically filled by Japanese singer Miyavi. Jolie could have done a bit more to build up the characters mythology and the sense of dread he imparts. But the young actor working mostly in English has a beauty and good sense of timing that serve him well in this malevolent part. The substantial aviation material looks quite real no matter how effects-generated it may be and Roger Deakins cinematography has a rugged elegance that combined with the general play of light and dark gives the film a richly satisfying palette. Jon Hutmans production design and Louise Frogleys costume designs display a proper sense of period verisimilitude as well as good clean lines.

Impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint have been brought to bear on ""Unbroken"" Angelina Jolies beautifully wrought but cumulatively underwhelming portrait of Louis Zamperini the Olympic runner-turned-U.S. Air Force bombardier who spent 47 days lost at sea and more than two years as a prisoner of the Japanese military during WWII. In re-creating the nightmarish journey so harrowingly relayed in Laura Hillenbrands biography Jolie has achieved something by turns eminently respectable and respectful to a fault maintaining an intimate character-driven focus that despite the skill of the filmmaking and another superb lead performance from Jack OConnell never fully roars to dramatic life. A bit embalmed in its own nobility its an extraordinary story told in dutiful unexceptional terms the passionate commitment of all involved rarely achieving gut-level impact. With a major awards push for Jolie and her topnotch collaborators -- d.p. Roger Deakins composer Alexandre Desplat and editors Tim Squyres and William Goldenberg not least among them -- Universal should be able to court a sizable worldwide audience for this capably stirring morally unambiguous and classically polished prestige picture about an unusually spirited member of the Greatest Generation who survived a hell beyond anyones imagination. (Zamperini died in July at the age of 97 due to complications from pneumonia.) After languishing in development for decades the project finally took viable shape with the 2010 publication of Hillenbrands book adapted here by the unlikely team of the Coen brothers (in their third scripting-for-hire gig after 2012s ""Gambit"" and 1985s ""Crimewave"") Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Regardless of their individual contributions none of the credited writers faced an easy or enviable task in fashioning a feature-length narrative out of their exhaustively researched source material (for which Hillenbrand interviewed Zamperini 75 times over the course of eight years). In runners parlance ""Unbroken"" feels like a good steady 10k where a marathon was arguably called for For all its scenes of intense deprivation and extreme brutality the film never quite manages over the course of 137 carefully measured minutes to reproduce the feeling of a sustained endurance test. Nor does it succeed in dramatizing the human need for faith and forgiveness one of its more baldly stated themes in more than perfunctory platitudinous terms. Of course to expect any movie to place the viewer directly into Zamperinis spiked cleats or even begin to approximate the depth and horror of his wartime experiences would hold it to an impossible standard. Yet the bar is set unreasonably high from the moment ""Unbroken"" introduces itself as ""a true story"" a presumptuous choice of words (the ""based on"" qualifier is conspicuously absent) that the script never fully earns as it guides us through a series of conventional connect-the-dots flashbacks. An exciting aerial-combat prologue finds OConnells Louis  -- or Louie as he was more commonly known -- flying a rickety B-24 bomber over the Pacific where he and his comrades drop their payload on Japanese bases shoot down Zero planes and take plenty of fire in return. In short order were introduced to Louies younger self (a perfectly cast C.J. Valleroy) a restless often bullied and misunderstood kid from Torrance Calif. whose trouble-making antics give his Italian immigrant parents (Maddalena Ischiale Vincenzo Amato) no shortage of grief. Yet his older brother Pete (played at different ages by John DLeo and Alex Russell) soon recognizes that Louies talent of getting himself in and out of various scrapes has made him an uncommonly fast runner and before long the kid is not just a high-school track star but a local legend hailed in the papers as ""the Tornado of Torrance."" ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"" Pete tells his brother in one of those handy endlessly recyclable nuggets of thematic wisdom that will resonate just a few short scenes later when 19-year-old Louie makes it to the 1936 Berlin Olympics and places a not-too-shabby eighth in the 5000-meter race. Although theres a brief glimpse of Jesse Owens (Bangalie Keita) and swastika flags foreshadowing events on the not-too-distant horizon the film notably omits such juicy details as Louies brief handshake with Hitler focusing instead on the lads quicksilver ability to defy the odds to evince a sudden burst of speed or stamina when it counts most -- whether that means overtaking his more seasoned opponents on the track or surviving the horrific ordeal that awaits him on May 27 1943. On that day a B-24 crashes into the Pacific killing eight men aboard and leaving Louie stranded at sea with his pilot Capt. Russell Alan ""Phil"" Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and tail gunner Sgt. Francis ""Mac"" McNamara (Finn Wittrock). Bobbing along in two life rafts with dwindling rations fending off attacks by neighboring sharks and Japanese bombers (at one point simultaneously) the three men will last more than a month before Mac succumbs leaving Phil and Louie to drift sun-scorched and emaciated for another 15 days or so. Yet the films attempts to convey the slow arduous passage of time feel rushed and noncommittal effectively cherry-picking the books more memorable nautical setpieces and adding a few temporal markers (""Day 18"" etc.) quick visual dissolves and the stately swells of Desplats score. Following a recent wave of intensely immersive survival stories (""All Is Lost"" makes a particularly instructive comparison) ""Unbrokens"" streamlined checklist-style approach seems all the more rote and obligatory. See MoreAngelina Jolie on the Emotional Journey of Unbroken The sense that were getting the slightly watered-down version persists when Louie and Phil fall into Japanese hands and are sent to Omori a POW camp in Tokyo. The two friends are forcibly separated and for the films remaining hour or so Louie will have a far less welcome companion in the form of Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Miyavi) aka ""the Bird"" a terrifyingly sadistic Japanese army sergeant who immediately takes a special interest in this quietly defiant American prisoner in whom he sees a flickering shadow of his own ferocious life force. Yet Watanabes affection manifests itself in the most brutal possible way as he beats his favorite mercilessly with a kendo stick for minor or nonexistent infractions (the camera rarely flinches even when our hero does) at one point even forcing the other prisoners to line up and punch Louie in the face for no reason one by one. Jolie previously examined the dehumanization of war in her little-seen 2011 directing debut ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" a muddled but provocative drama set in 1990s Bosnia-Herzegovina. ""Unbroken"" serves up a similarly relentless catalog of wartime woes -- filthy conditions crippling thirst and hunger back-breaking labor nonstop verbal and physical abuse nasty injuries ritualized humiliations and the hopeless knowledge that an Allied victory will only bring about the prisoners execution. Yet theres something unmistakably soft-edged if not sanitized about these PG-13 horrors the accrual of which produces a curious sort of paradox by films end What weve seen is at once plenty grueling and nowhere near grueling enough on the basis of what Zamperini really went through. (""Wherere the maggots? Wheres the dysentery?"" my screening companion whispered over the closing credits unsatisfied by a relatively tasteful scene of Louie and his fellow inmates disposing of their presumably disease-ridden excrement.) Any dramatic account of real-life events must of course filter and condense yet several omissions in ""Unbroken"" are especially telling Were denied any real sense of the young Louies insatiable appetite for mischief; nor do we see him and his comrades conversing in secret code or paying hilariously flatulent tribute to Japans Emperor Hirohito or conceiving a desperate plot to murder Watanabe -- or barring that inducing a crippling bout of diarrhea that puts the miserable sergeant out of commission for more than a week. Jolie sensitively conveys the solemn intimacy and tender camaraderie that arise among men at war but she never captures these soldiers in all their bawdy rough-and-tumble vigor and rebellious energy; nor does she evoke the fire in Zamperinis belly that made him not just a survivor but a natural-born leader his instincts and intellect as nimble as his feet. To its credit the movie doesnt shy away from showing Louie praying his way through much of his ordeal at one point promising to dedicate his life to God in the unlikely event that he survived. (He did and he did.) Indeed ""Unbroken"" is not above turning its subject into a sort of 20th-century Christ figure namely when the Bird forces Louie to lift a heavy beam over his shoulders and hold the position for what feels like hours on end. Yet the dramatic seeds that are planted here never fully take root Zamperinis post-rescue conversion and his subsequent attempts at a moral reckoning with his captors are dispensed with in the closing titles leaving you blinking at the unrealized potential of a longer bolder and more spiritually inquisitive movie than this one. Where Jolies restraint pays off is in her keenly concentrated focus on Louies interior journey; there is a brief cutaway to the distressed Zamperini family at a logical point in the narrative but little in the way of contextualizing dates and details and only the barest of allusions to the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the war draws to a close. All in all given its subject ""Unbroken"" is a remarkably quiet picture; the mens dialogue exchanges tend toward the terse and sardonic while the silences are often freighted with tension and anxiety and Jolie wisely lets much of the drama play out in her actors unfailingly eloquent faces. Its been a while since a young male performer seized the screen with such startling force as OConnell whom festival and arthouse audiences may know from his excellent performances in the recent ""Starred Up"" and the forthcoming ""71."" The conception of his character here may leave something to be desired but OConnells acting has rarely been more soulful or delicate Once more he has placed his extraordinary physicality in service of an intensely demanding role requiring him to run like the wind stand as still as a stone and undergo any number of weight fluctuations in between. Yet its also a performance built from innumerable fine-grained details -- a suddenly clenched posture or a quickly downturned glance to name two of Louies natural responses whenever the Bird appears. Miyavi a Japanese singer-songwriter making his bigscreen debut was a smartly counterintuitive choice for the role and if he never quite nails the perverse sexual rapture that Watanabe derives from the abuse he dishes out the actor more than upholds his half of the films sinister psychological duet. (He also may help stir his fans interest in a picture whose matter-of-fact treatment of Japanese brutality will require especially careful handling in Asian markets.) Gleeson going blond for a change is excellent as the faithful friend who serves as an occasional spiritual guide to Louie; of the other soldier roles Garrett Hedlund has the most substantial screen time as Louies ally Cmdr. John Fitzgerald. Whether shooting on land in air or at sea (with Australian locations ably standing in for all three) Deakins delivers unsurprisingly beautiful images of exceptional richness and clarity. The visuals achieve a particularly vivid sense of place in production designer Jon Hutmans meticulous re-creations of Omori and Naoetsu the camp to which Zamperini was transferred in March 1945; no less impressive is the fluidity of the camerawork in and around the tight interiors of the B-24s enhanced considerably by the input of adviser Bob Livingstone. Even when the characters faces and bodies are smudged with blood mud soot and worse the technical package is never short of immaculate.

So disappointed. Reply Bill Sowles says March 25 2015 at 441 pm It is difficult to show all that is in the book. Never the less Angie did a remarkable job as director with a great story that occurred over 60 years ago. Her portrayal of Louie was as fresh as if it was done in the real world of WWII. ""Unbroken"" is a movie that I want my children and grandchildren to see. Reply Gregory says January 19 2015 at 449 pm there is a reason for lining up and getting every prisoner to punch Louie. in the movie its to teach Louie respect and in the book its for stealing fish. Reply Lenny Jennings says January 15 2015 at 447 pm Yeah there were a few things were they could of picked up the tempoi.e. The ocean scenes could have been cut into a montage but over all... it worked. Good job for a newbie Actor/Director as well as cast and crew. I think the film had a ""flavor"" all its own. Thats what I look for. To me thats what the Directors do. You either got it..... or you dont. Ms. Jolie got it Reply Angel Howansky says January 6 2015 at 942 am I think the critics are being a little harsh on the movie. I enjoyed the movie and give Angelina and the entire team an A+. Maybe the critics do not want creative female directors to succeed? It may not be picture of the year but it will be a contender. AngelPR at Angel Howinsky LLC Celebrity Branding and Publicity. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says January 6 2015 at 1147 am The only people that matter the public have spoken Unbroken is a hit and that cannot be taken away by any critic with an agenda. Angie always said the only thing she wanted for this film was that people saw what a great man Louis was she succeeded. Congrats Angie once again you made the critics and those with an ""agenda"" paid for by others look like the cowards they are. The film will open in China soon it should do well there. Reply m.heard says December 30 2014 at 614 pm I sat in a packed movie theater and the majority of the audience like myself  thought the film was extremely realistic . Ms. Jolie was very brave to take on such a dfifficut story to telland yet seemed to have the audience mesmirized. I am sure your critic found that gross and not worth ones dollar to spend on ""Gone Girl"" an Academy Award winner. What Garbage truck did he fall off?desilou Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 30 2014 at 1107 am I dont believe anyone saw any evidence of what the cult called Scientologist believe in the film. Louie calls out to God for help he didnt ask for the Mother Ship. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 30 2014 at 1058 am I know a few have said Angie left basically part 2 of Louies life out. But if Louie had never gone through what he did the torture and cruelty of the POW camp there may never have been a ""part 2"" the drinking the abuse of his wife all that was because of his nightmares from what he had endured. Luckily his wife forced him to that Billy Graham revival it was a ""you go. or I go"" type of situation. Angie has said she would have loved to have made a 5 hour film and shown everything but that wasnt feasible. Thats why I believe everyone should read the book even if they have seen the film to get the whole story of Louies life. That still does not take away from the film which is very uplifting and inspiring. Reply jim Moore says December 30 2014 at 1001 am Oops its Zamperini- my bad Reply EBW212 says December 27 2014 at 1149 am Justin writes ""so harrowingly relayed in Laura Hillenbrands biography.."" In this case the word is related not relayed. Enjoy your reviews Justin Reply Farmer says December 26 2014 at 714 pm I read the book. I loved it. I watched the Brokaw interview. I saw the movie. MEAH. Complete retardation. The cinematography was excellent. The actors were compelling. The editing was horrible and the ending abrupt. The footnotes completing the movie were painted with very broad brush strokes. It was a disservice to the great Zamperini. The press is so in the tank for Jolie. I will use this movie and its ratings by reviewers as a benchmark for future viewings. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 26 2014 at 916 pm Theres always one that needs to find the negative so youve looked and searched till you found what you consider a negative. Millions disagree with you I think Ill stick with the millions that have more joy in their lives than those that always look for the negative. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 27 2014 at 444 pm I really dont understand your reply but I do know you cant be too thrilled with the BO results. It must be really upsetting to want something to fail and then have it be such a resounding success. [A] (villings) says December 27 2014 at 1126 am Damn. You must be on the verge of suicide.  lucylu (indi15243) that is. Tandalayo says December 26 2014 at 630 pm I read this book in jail...being there for 8 months..for trying to see my daughter (and there was a protection order over nothing)... I am a female...but this book helped to give me such strength...you have no idea. I too had to endure the cruelty of guards...poor conditions..but not like our storys hero. I look forward to seeing the film.. Louie is one of the most memorable men I have ever read about...which is a testament to how many other men and women are the hidden heroes of our society...of our whole world. Just because they are not famous in politics (ha...not many there) celebrities (again not many there)...is no reason to think they dont exist....In fact most of the real heroes are never known..... Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 26 2014 at 710 pm Thats sad no one should keep a child from its Mother. Im glad Louies story gave you strength and hopefully things will get better for you. May this New year bring you happiness and a renewed relationship with your child. Im sorry to hear you were treated badly in jail that is so wrong on so many levels. Reply Gary says December 25 2014 at 509 pm After viewing the entire 217 full length film UNBROKEN on its Xmas day opening - the life story of Louie Zamperini amp; film passes with flying colors This unbelievable film will persevere despite those critics calling for its dismissal or rejection. Its recommended that you be insistent and go see Unbroken starring Jack OConnell amp; directed by Angelina Jolie for your own gratification amp; enjoyment. ""If you dont give up you can win."" Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 25 2014 at 710 pm More than likely PAID critics by studios that want their film to have a better box office or just some that would like to put the ""little lady"" in her place. How dare Angelina Jolie be as smart and in most cases smarter then the so called powerful men in HW. Angie held her head high and shes proving them all wrong again. Wonder how many dozens and dozens of roses have been sent to Angie by Rudin today. Hopefully Angie had them sent to a hospital or some other facility she doesnt need Rudin but Rudin certainly NEEDS her desperately. Reply Peter Lombardo says December 17 2014 at 1037 am Ms. Jolie did you even read the book? Mr. Zamperinis battle with alcoholism when he returned from the war and his subsequent recovery thanks in no small part to the Reverend Billy Graham was a central part of his story. That is finally and forever UNBROKEN. How could you have missed this? Reply onceuponaclassroom says December 27 2014 at 1005 am She was asked to leave it out. The movie is still great. It just focuses on a small part of his life. Yes she read the book and knew Louie well. They were neighbors and friends. I say this as not a fan of her too. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 27 2014 at 448 pm Who said she was asked to leave it out Angie never said that. The movie is great and reference to faith is definitely there many times. lindaj52 says December 20 2014 at 1210 pm People please understand the book was too long to put everything in a 2 hour movie. Angie addresses this fact there HAD to be a cut off point. And that point was when Louie returned from the war but dont get your undies in a bunch there is still a lot of reference to Louies faith in God throughout the film Angie did not leave that out. Reply Rich says December 17 2014 at 145 pm I saw the movie at the Hollywood Premier. Everyone there wanted it to be awesome but it wasnt. Not awesome does not mean ""bad"" by any means. I think the story was so good and the book so good there was a reason the film had not ever been made before even though the rights were sold for it in the 1950s. To depict the whole story and do it justice the movie really needed to be an unrealistic 5 hours long. There was so much missing but in order to make it a watchable length there wasnt time to develop other characters and situations. That and trying to keep it PG-13 friendly. I would still absolutely recommend seeing the movie as it would be time and money well spent. If you havent read the book yet you might be better off not doing so until after youve seen the movie. Then for extra credit get Louies autobiography ""The Devil at My Heels"". Reply Ronni says December 15 2014 at 526 pm I have not yet seen this movie but did read the book which was awesome. If the book was followed it has to be good. Never was a fan of Angie but over the last year I have come to like and respect her. Hope this does well as she put her heart and soul into it..... Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 27 2014 at 450 pm It is definitely doing well much to the dismay of some. lol Reply onceuponaclassroom says December 27 2014 at 1008 am This is the best review I agree. I liked the movie did not love it. Love the book it was life changing and will now pick up a new book I was unaware of. Thank you Reply Clemdane says December 15 2014 at 211 am I am thankful for this films massive overwhelming ad budget. Its let me know indirectly about Hillenbrands book which I now can look forward to reading. Reply Matt says December 13 2014 at 433 pm This could have been a spectacular movie with a story worth telling. Instead it was given to a minimally talented director and she ruined it. Reply kathi says December 19 2014 at 1159 pm I agree. Minimal at best Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 13 2014 at 544 pm Angie is getting good reviews for her directing no one has said anything about Angie not being up to the task of directing this film. People who for unknown reasons hate a woman they do not even know have decide to go after this film. Its not even coming out till Christmas. Stop embarrassing yourself by saying things against a film no one has been able to see yet. Reply Peter Lombardo says December 17 2014 at 1114 am First of all I dont hate women. Secondly I dont know Ms. Jolie. However I did read the Ms. Hildebrands book. Moreover I attended a lecture series where Mr. Zamperini himself was the featured speaker. For Ms. Jolie and the producers of ""Unbroken"" to omit the part the Reverend Billy Graham played in Mr. Zamperinis batle with alcoholism when he returned from the war is to have missed the essence of his story. He was finally and forever unbroken. It would be like George Bailey in Frank Capras ""Its a Wonderful Life"" forgetting to thank the angel Clarence during the movies final scene. David says December 13 2014 at 343 pm Can anybody explain to me why the compelling story portrayed in the wonderful book by Laura Hillenbrand was turned over to a wanna-be director (Jolie) with bunch of VERY young actors that most of us have never heard of before? From everything Ive seen and read this story should have been left up to a pro (i.e. Speilberg et al). Mr. Zamperini his family and colleagues deserved to have this story told competently. Reply onceuponaclassroom says December 27 2014 at 1012 am His family collaborated on the movie so did Louie. ??? Reply onceuponaclassroom says December 27 2014 at 1011 am Research please it was left out on purpose and by request. Either way not part of the story time frame. also the acting was wonderful that comment makes no sense. Who did you want to play young Louie Clint Eastwood? Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 15 2014 at 250 am If the writers the Coen Brothers and Angie had made the film exactly like the book it would have an R-Rating they wanted many young people to see the film the only way to do that was to make it a PG-13 film. As Angie said much of the violence in in the film is only off camera you can hear what is happening but they did not show it therefore you can rest assured there is violence in the film just like the book. The screenplay is as close to the book as they could make it seeing as they had to put so much of Louies life into just over two hours. Reply kathi says December 20 2014 at 1211 am Are you Jolies. Spokesperson or something? Arent people allowed an opinion without your 2 cents for what ever thats worth? Allow others to voice their opinions without getting on your soap box please. God who are you anyway???? 1loner says December 8 2014 at 407 pm When I saw the trailer I turned to my wife and cringed. This was obviously a sanitized version of the book aimed at a wider/younger audience. I wondered what the author thought of the film and found out she wrote a YA version of the book to be released in November of this year. This is really a shame because the book is powerful and young people need to see what the ugliness of war can do to individuals nations and humanity. I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 13 2014 at 815 pm You must ""cringe"" at almost every movie trailer. Dont tell me I can already tell youre a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy right. Got that low income low IQ vibe from you. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 20 2014 at 1234 pm Hows that ""diet"" working for you ""kathi"". The gastric bypass still keeping your weight under 300 pounds or have you ballooned back up the Goodyear Blimp youve always been mistaken for. Dont comment if you dont like the fact others have a different opinion. (Yes its a well known fact you yoga chick Mandy and also Big Leigh the life coach troll the sites and harass anyone that likes and respects Angie dont think for a second people dont know who you are or who pays you) kathi says December 20 2014 at 1217 am No kidding. What a classless twit lucylu (indi15243) says December 15 2014 at 1038 pm Obviously youre part of another films PR the way youre trashing a film you have never seen. Clemdane says December 15 2014 at 204 am Apparently youre related to someone in the movie the way you are viciously irrationally attacking anyone who has doubts about it. Im just going to discount anything you may have to say here. Peggy Allen says December 7 2014 at 853 am Are there any American actors in hollywood? I keep seeing Australian or British actors portraying Americans. The actor playing the lead doesnt look American. I thought it was about a British soldier. Reply Eli says December 4 2014 at 1111 pm Saw the film at a special screening tonight and its a beautiful looking movie but its not a particularly good movie. I never learn why this man is so special above the other survivors and some of it is laughably badly written. The end which the poster seems to emulate has a moment of soldiers... I wont even go further except to say it is the most heavy handed false moment Ive ever seen in the history of movies. Its not bad but its neither good... it is simply The Passion of the Lou as bland entertainment. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 5 2014 at 1052 am Did you see Argo an awful movie and not even close to the truth even though it was supposedly a ""true"" story. What about August Osage County I cringed through that whole film horrible acting even by the usually always great Meryl but Julia was just embarrassingly bad. Believe me Unbroken is a gift of a film if you go back and watch those turkeys. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 13 2014 at 547 pm You need to be blaming the Coen Brothers but others have said the film was wonderful. Makes me wonder if youre really being truthful about seeing it most negative comments are usually from trolls. J J K says December 6 2014 at 828 am Argo is Citizen Kane compare to the absolute mess Unbroken is. One of the worst most laughable screenplays with dialogue as heavy as Christs cross... just such an awful movie. I never in life hated a movie as much I literally felt myself age in the seat. lucylu (indi15243) says December 5 2014 at 1044 am Sorry maybe Louie should have had some wild parties and lots of women to make you happy. Too bad the TRUE story not embellished for the screen which is unheard of doesnt meet your criteria of ""fun"" movies. Reply Gary says December 4 2014 at 1026 pm The film Unbroken would be difficult for any actor to duplicate the valorous life of Louis Zamperini. Jack OConnell does a gritty amp; glorious job of taking the audience through the personal story of Zamperinis Olympic exploits; POW experience amp; ultimate survival during WW II. It is the task of Director Angelina Jolie to guide us on the path of the main protagonists heroic victory over his brutal antagonist Japanese camp Sargent Watanabe. And she does a very splendid job indeed. We must not forget that the war action filming of B-24 bombers attacking the Japan held Pacific islands is secondary to two America fliers ditching their plane amp; floating on a life raft for 2amp;1/2 months in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean. It is their winning survival at the end which makes this film a must see for us - honoring the Greatest Generation who saved this country from 1941 to 1945 We salute amp; thank the producers actors amp; film makers for the making the book Unbroken into a stout-hearted film for movie goers. It will be a triumphant success. Reply Dan says December 11 2014 at 845 am Zamperini floated in the life raft for six weeks not 2 and a half months. Reply TheBigBangOf20thCenturyPopCulture says December 3 2014 at 630 pm This looks like a valiant effort to tell the tale of a rare war survivor. But it remains to be seen whether it will earn industry buzz by not conforming to usual unsung underdog depictions. The mere idea that Hollywood would not even fund this film is a hint that it may also snub it come awards time. In short this movie will go unnoticed because it was about an Italian-American from an ethnic minority group that Hollywood prefers to marginalize or stereotype in the movies. Sad but true. Reply vet says December 17 2014 at 848 pm Its not getting awards because it is basically viewed as the Marquis de Sades version of a Lifetime Channel movie. It has no depth or soul. Stop whining about sexism. Its not sexism. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 13 2014 at 550 pm Paramount funded the film. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 13 2014 at 552 pm Sorry my bad Universal funded the film as it funded By the Sea too. Moviegoer says December 1 2014 at 919 pm You obviously are a critic not a moviegoer. This moviegoer was totally and completely enthralled and near tears throughout the movie. Its a shame there are so many critics in this too critical world. I hope this wonderful movie touches the hearts of moviegoers everywhere who get to experience too few joys like Unbroken. Jolies vision came to life for us not you. Reply moviespotter71 says December 1 2014 at 532 pm Excellent ) Cant wait to see this movie. I believe that Jack OConnell has a great potential. We will be hearing good things about the guy in the next few years. Fingers crossed for Roger Deakins Reply Micha says December 1 2014 at 415 pm ""....several omissions in ""Unbroken"" are especially telling Were denied any real sense of the young Louies insatiable appetite for mischief; nor do we see him and his comrades conversing in secret code or paying hilariously flatulent tribute to Japans Emperor Hirohito or conceiving a desperate plot to murder Watanabe -- or barring that inducing a crippling bout of diarrhea that puts the miserable sergeant out of commission for more than a week."" So youre not satisfied with the movie because Angelina left out his farting and diarrhea from the movie? What are you smoking? Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 1 2014 at 415 pm The film ends when Louie returns home. Angie said there was enough left to make another movie about his alcoholism and then meeting Billy Graham just tons of material but there had to be a stopping point for the film version. Why dont you ""S. Norton"" get the rights and make the film the way YOU think it should be made if you feel that strongly about it. Reply David M. says December 1 2014 at 918 pm Thats a ridiculous comment. His job is to critique the film. According to your logic he shouldnt be able to give his opinion about the movie unless he attempts to make it himself? Reply stannorton says December 1 2014 at 812 pm I thought this was a discussion not an attack or argument. And the rights have already been secured. Reply S Norton says December 1 2014 at 404 pm It is unfortunate that this film according to the review minimizes Louis conversion story on his return after the war. It is the very essence and the climax of the book. Where is Capra when you need him? Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 27 2014 at 1246 am You mean the same Capra whose film Its a Wonderful Life was panned by critics and was a BO bomb. The same Capra the critics said made IAWL too risque for the average movie goer. That Capra? Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 5 2014 at 1047 am I see reading comprehension is NOT a strong suit for many commenters. Reply B25JCrew says December 1 2014 at 226 pm If you are going to write a credible review do your homework and get your terminology correct. What does it mean to ""shoot down Zero planes""? Do you mean that no airplanes were shot down? They are not called ""Zero planes"" but rather ""Mitsubishi Zeros"" or ""Japanese Zeros."" Also Louis was not a U.S. Air Force bombardier. The USAF did not exist until 18 November 1947. He was a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Reply Innis Mor says December 1 2014 at 403 pm Oxymoron ... asking a movie critic to do homework. I know; these stodgy critics arent big on getting many of the facts straight. The guy over at the Guardian was on the same anti-Jolie bent. He even called the B24s ""B52s"" .... lol  Book writer (Hillenbrand) and Filmaker (Jolie) put tremendous effort and detail into getting the story right and authentic and then self-adoltoring critics decide to find fault with accurate portrayal. ""Makes it stodgy."" (Of course the guy at The Guardian loved The Kings Speech"""" -- not stodgy at all but British lol POWs from Japanese POW camps that have seen Unbroken describe the POW scenes as being very realistic to their experience as opposed to those portrayed in the beloved The Bridge on the River Kwai. But ha the critics dont care about the factual portrayal in a biopic ... just give them fantasy Off to The Hobbit they go Oohhhh yum Hobbitses Jeepers. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 1 2014 at 421 pm Some of the critics are just off the wall crazy. Many had their Unbroken review written months ago theyve couldnt wait to get at Angie. How dare she be beautiful kind smart a successful actress and producer plus be a great Mother and wife to Brad Pitt. They have a need to tear her down if a man had directed this film hed be hailed the greatest thing since sliced bread. shell says December 1 2014 at 128 pm never been impressed with Jolie as an actress or a director......redundant and boring Reply lindaj52 says December 4 2014 at 1131 pm Bet you loved Horrible Bosses 2 though...right. lol Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 1 2014 at 1107 am Im sure Unbroken more than meets any fan of he book Unbroken. Variety has been sharpening its claws for months on Angelina Jolies film trying to nit pit every single aspect. Did they do that with Birdman the most boring 900 hours (feels like) of nothingness ever put on celluloid I think not. Unbroken will be a huge hit Angie is held to a higher standard by critics that no one on this earth could achieve. Face it Angies beauty works against her men think gorgeous women should be stupid and Angie is not what they perceive a gorgeous woman to be. Reply frank markus says December 1 2014 at 852 am We can wait to see Angelina Jolie ""Unbroken"" My friend told me its a brilliant movie  We love Angelina Jolie. Reply blancaster60 says December 1 2014 at 837 am If you have read the book on which this movie is based - as I have and many thousands more - you will probably want to see the film. If for no other reason I will go see it because of the tremendous respect I have for Louis Zamperini. And based on what I have read here and elsewhere the movie does honor him. Perhaps it wont live up to the greatness of the book. Many good films adapted from highly successful books have fallen short of that mark. But every once in a while I like to watch a movie thats more about the triumph of the human spirit and less about portraying the world as one big shhole filled with people who have few if any redeeming qualities. Louis was one of the good guys and I am thankful that Jolie has made an effort bring his story to life. Reply Ted says December 1 2014 at 833 am She has fallen in the same category as kitrashians. She gets 1 yawn. Reply Teri says December 5 2014 at 924 am They (Brad amp; Angie) together or as individuals are of a select few celebrities who get it right. They manage to keep thier life private and normal relativily speaking contribute their time and money to several national and international causes and clearly dont feel the need to feed the papparazzi with daily outings tweets etc. They are not over-exposed and they continue to be arguably 2 of the most respected and celebrated celebrities worldwide. For you to compare them to the Kardashians says more about you than them... Also if one is objective and fair the fact that she created a good if not perfect movie on just her second directorial project says she shows great promise. Reply lucylu (indi15243) says December 4 2014 at 1135 pm You dont see Angie and Brad for months at a time unless they are promoting a film part of their job. Still havent figured out what the Katrashians jobs really are besides being famewhres and being total wastes of oxygen. Reply Dee says December 1 2014 at 811 am I wonder how her original film before Universal cut it so it would be more commercial deeming the original to art house differed? I would love to read a comparative review ot the two cuts. Reply lindaj52 says December 4 2014 at 1129 pm I saw an interview Angie did just last night she said SHE oversaw the movie from beginning to the very last frame. I think thats her way of answering the people that think Universal had final cut. Reply Rick Patel (shilparules) says December 1 2014 at 639 am More soggy Pablum from Jolie. No thanks. Reply Gabriel Kostner says December 1 2014 at 635 am I wonder if this movie which is essentially Jolies ""Paean To The White Man"" represents some sideways apology to her uber-conservative father and his presence as a constant caustic conservative on Fox News? I will not hold my breath waiting for Fox to cover their maudlin family reunion. Reply maichlonizer says December 1 2014 at 608 am Reblogged this on Maichlonizers.
