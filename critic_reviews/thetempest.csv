You expect Nicolas Cage to pop up from behind a sand dune on a Harley brandishing a rocket launcher. Sound and fury all but drown out a forceful performance by Helen Mirren as the usurped duke Prospero exiled to a desert island - and recast here as a woman Prospera by director Julie Taymor (Frida).Mirren gamely appears in unkind close-ups without a scrap of vanity or make-up at times autocratic and imperious and elsewhere consumed with vengeance. The gender switch reeks of gimmickry but Mirren performs compellingly and with conviction as does Felicity Jones as 15-year-old Miranda; when mother looks at daughter its as if she ruefully watches herself before a lifetime of tribulation. Russell Brand - clearly believing Shakespeare has got nothing on his own oiky shtick - camps it up royally as jester Trinculo (On my troff I said nuffink) last seen with flaming CGI-ed hounds of hell in pursuit.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 05 2010 1134AM EDT Last updated Friday Nov. 05 2010 235PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English THE PLAY Shakespeares last complete play The Tempest tells the story of Prospero the deposed Duke of Milan who has been shipwrecked for 12 years on an enchanted island where has devoted himself to the study of magic. As the play opens he plots to restore his daughter to her inheritance by conjuring a great storm that brings his old enemies to his shores. Prosperos magic is a finely wrought metaphor for the theatres own illusion and so the role of the aging magician who gives up his powers once he has seen his enemies defeated and his daughter married is traditionally a valedictorian speech for a veteran actor - just as it was Shakespeares swan song. The play is shot through with dark reflections on the abuse of power and the nature of captivity but the theatrical focus on a retiring great encourages audiences to see Prosperos magic as wholly benign. William Hutt then reigning king of the Stratford company played the role there in 1999 before taking a year off from the stage. He assayed it again in 2005 before retiring at age 85. He died two years later. Film and stage actor Christopher Plummer long may he reign is now 80 and took to the same thrust stage last June to abjure his rough magic in his turn. But not before he had done his own conjuring with the farewell speech that begins ""Our revels now are ended. These our actors/ As I foretold you were all spirits and/ Are melted into air into thin air...."" THE PRODUCTION At the Stratford Shakespeare Festival artistic director Des McAnuff whipped up a show that was full of stage magic - twinkling lights acrobatic spirits and a levitating Prospero - but reviews for these effects were mixed while Plummer earned the accolades. It was a performance that was more overtly dramatic than Hutts had been creating a man more visibly angry than the huge but weary intelligence of his predecessor but both actors showed similar dexterity with the text breathing life into every line. Plummers performance deepened as the play progressed giving a particularly poignant rendition of the key speeches at the end of the play. While blessed with a lusty wild child in the figure of Trish Lindstroms Miranda Plummers real partner in the production was the otherworldly pixie created by Julyana Soelistyo as Ariel. With both her crisp movements and efficient delivery she created a delightful little birdlike counterpoint to Plummers heavy figure. The weight they brought to their relationship infused Prosperos final abdication of his magic with a real sense of loss. There was much less sense of any emotional stake in the plot of revenge and renewal played out by a cast of secondary characters led by Peter Hutts oddly mannered rendition of Alonso grieving for the son he believes drowned. As the comic relief Geraint Wyn Daviess tartan-clad Stephano and Bruce Dows mincing Trinculo produced the occasional very welcome flash of something truly nasty in their attempts to subjugate the monster Caliban and overthrow Prospero but mainly this rather hoary comedy remained just that. THE FILM After success filming the Stratford production of Bernard Shaws Caesar and Cleopatra last year producer Barry Avrich turns to The Tempest presumably because of Plummers box-office power. Otherwise it is a very odd choice for the filmed treatment Why take an extended metaphor for the stage and try to package it in another medium? The play was filmed live during three performances and in an age where computer animation can produce any magic it wants the theatrical illusions inevitably cant bear the scrutiny of the close-up. The revolving set looks merely quaint; move in on the towering goddesses who celebrate Mirandas wedding and you can see the glitter makeup and the body stockings. There are exceptions Dion Johnstones creeping Caliban one of a series of spiny monsters who apparently populated the stage but fail to populate the film has the most remarkable cats eyes. However they were created in the theatre their weirdness is perfectly captured by the camera. Otherwise one is left simply with the performances in a film of many camera angles but little cinematic invention. (McAnuff gets credit as director; Shelagh OBrien as camera director.) Those performances are fine and this film serves as their faithful record The review of their merits above is based on watching the film without seeing the play. This is that worthy but rather old-fashioned (and not very expensive) thing a filmed stage play rather than a film adaptation and will satisfy only those who might have wished to have gone to Stratford but didnt.

Comments click to enlarge The Tempest Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2010 Shakespeares final play is often read as a personal valedictory with Prospero the elderly sorcerer doubling for the magical Bard. But for a filmmaker like Julie Taymor Shakespeares language isnt nearly as enticing as Prosperos violent manipulation of the elements and this screen adaptation of the play--like her egregious Beatles movie Across the Universe (2007)--is primarily an exercise in eccentric (and I would argue empty) spectacle. The main beneficiary of her CGI-candy is the mischievous sprite Ariel (Ben Whishaw) mugging and mutating into countless wacky forms; Helen Mirren stars as the feminized protagonist Prospera; and Djimon Hounsou in the sort of racial typecasting were supposed to have outgrown is the savage Caliban who looks like he sat on the grill too long before someone turned him over. The able cast also includes Alfred Molina Russell Brand Alan Cumming and Matewan alums Chris Cooper and David Strathairn. By J.R.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 10 2010 Save for later Saved Helen Mirren is shown in a scene from the film The Tempest. Melinda Sue Gordon/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Maybe her mind was on other things - like preparing the troubled Broadway musical ""Spider-Man"" maybe? - but Julie Taymor has not done right by the Bard. Her 1999 ""Titus"" was powerful but ""The Tempest"" is weak tea indeed. Shakespeares (arguably) final play is already such a poetic imaginarium that making a movie out of it seems redundant. Its a visual feast on the page.It certainly isnt onscreen at least the way its been done here. (The best ""Tempest"" remains the sci-fi makeover ""Forbidden Planet."") Taymors rendition which misuses a good cast including Chris Cooper Djimon Hounsou David Strathairn and Tom Conti unwisely undergoes a gender-switch in which the banished ruler-magician Prospero becomes Prospera - i.e. Helen Mirren.Normally Id watch Helen Mirren in anything even if she was just putting out the laundry or reading the phone book. But given the roteness of her line readings here it might have been better if the phone book rather than Shakespeare was her text. When she launches into her ""Our revels now are ended"" soliloquy I felt like saying ""They havent begun"" Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for some nudity suggestive content and scary images.)

Neither is the allusive story with its themes of parent and child master and slave and sibling and sibling plumbed for contemporary resonance in the way Taymor used the ultraviolent Titus as an occasion for a meditation on violence.Mirren commands the screen and her minions (Ben Whishaw as spectral Ariel Djimon Hounsou as the solid Caliban). Thats the best that can be said of this Tempest that is both compressed and sluggish.In the multicharacter story constructed as four parallel narratives that ultimately converge only the thread with Prospera and Miranda has any dramatic urgency.This is disappointing with supporting players who include the boisterous Alfred Molina and Russell Brand.Given Taymors eye for visual poetry even more disappointing is that although The Tempest was largely shot on location in Hawaii its compositions are picturesque without adding anything to the story. With the exception of a scene of Prospera erupting in rage on a lava bed so underutilized are the settings that it might well have been filmed entirely in a studio.The costumes designed by Sandy Powell - leather gowns and military uniforms Renaissance in silhouette and detailed with zippers - are the films most arresting element.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Starring Helen Mirren Chris Cooper Alfred Molina Alan Cumming Djimon Hounsou Russell Brand David Strathairn Ben Whishaw Felicity Jones Tom Conti Director Julie Taymor Running time 150 Release Opened Dec 17 2010  Editorial Review A dream cast imprisonedBy Michael OSullivanFriday December 17 2010From one perspective filmmaker Julie Taymors ""The Tempest"" is a kind of highbrow ""Harry Potter"" film. Stuffed with unimpeachable performances by some of Britains most interesting actors - Helen Mirren Alfred Molina Tom Conti Alan Cumming Russell Brand Ben Whishaw Felicity Jones and others - and boasting a plot thats heavy on the magical shenanigans this pretty and poetic adaptation of Shakespeares play is a fantasia for the smart set a literary novelty for anyone who wants to have fun without giving up food for thought. On that score at least it delivers in spades. Mores the pity then that it doesnt feel very much like a movie. It opens with a shot of a storm-tossed ship at sea that looks like it was filmed in a splash pool with pails of water being tossed from just off camera. Taymor of course made her mark in theater with wildly original stagings of such spectacles as ""The Lion King."" Her specialty is puppetry with performers playing say giraffes in such a way that you see both the actor and the animal at the same time. So its no surprise that ""The Tempest"" - which famously features both an incorporeal sprite Ariel and a hideous monster Caliban - calls its otherworldly creatures into being not with CGI but with heavy theatrical makeup and dancelike movement. As Caliban whom the Bard described as ""not honourd with a human shape"" the Benin-born Djimon Hounsou is a kind of mud-caked primitive. The brown-skinned character is very much human however which lends the film a subtle (and somewhat distracting) racial subtext considering Calibans mistreatment at the hands of the otherwise all-white cast. Similarly Whishaws Ariel - a role that calls for the character to materialize and then vaporize periodically not to mention perform much of the plays magic - is rendered as a kind of androgynous punk pixie. With his thickly gelled hair all-white body paint and little else he comes across like a naked street mime. Theyre great character designs . . . for the stage. On screen they end up making the movie feel smaller and more claustrophobic than it should despite its photogenic big-as-all-outdoors Hawaiian setting. On the plus side? The plays poetry which here takes center stage and rightly so. Boasting some of Shakespeares most beautiful language ""The Tempest"" more than survives Taymors tinkering with the text. Thats thanks in no small measure to Mirren as the exiled Italian noblewoman-turned-wizard Prospera (a part thats normally played by a man). From her opening scene in which she conjures up a storm at sea in order to punish those who betrayed her to her ultimate forgiveness of her enemies Mirren tears into both the ferocious and the tender sides of the part. It makes one wonder why the role isnt played by a woman more often. The gender reversal lends especially rich new layers of meaning to Prosperas relationship with her daughter Miranda (Jones). Brand and Molina also make indelible impressions as buffoonish drunkards Trinculo and Stephano. ""The Tempest"" has always been one of Shakespeares trickiest plays thematically. Its dual themes of revenge and reconciliation almost cancel each other out. More than anything else however its also a play about playing. Near the end Mirren gets to deliver her characters most famous speech the one about how ""We are such stuff as dreams are made on."" Its a reminder to the audience that theyve just watched a mind game and indeed that life itself is just a dream. Given the staginess of Taymors stubbornly uncinematic tale its an unnecessary reminder. Most plays-turned-movies try to open things up. Taymor still thinks like a theater director ending up with a ""Tempest"" that takes place in a teapot.Contains nudity suggestive material and frightening images.

"Shakespeare resists Taymors twists - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Shakespeare resists Taymors twistsThe Tempest a 2 starsDecember 16 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe closing-credits sequence in director/adapter Julie Taymors film version of ""The Tempest"" rewards you with all the beauty poetry simplicity and grace eluding the film proper.Her sorceress staff broken her rough magic thrown to the seas Prospera (it was a he Prospero in the early 17th century William Shakespeare original) prepares to return to her old life with the knowledge her daughters happiness has been secured. The trade-off Taymor stresses is painfully bittersweet. The wordless epilogue takes us underwater where we see Prosperas book of spells and other remnants of her sorcery floating away down down down. A beautiful image.Meanwhile weve just finished watching a pretty frustrating adaptation of Shakespeares play one that dog-paddles around in ever-more-frenetic circles searching for a way inside the material. This is Taymors fourth feature and her second Shakespeare film; ""Titus"" precedes it. Shot in the Hawaiian islands featuring Helen Mirren in the central gender-switched role ""The Tempest"" will be of some interest to both Shakespeare fans and Taymors admirers. Here and there the wonder emerges. Then its gone again undone by the notoriously difficult comic relief the equally tricky scheming of the shipwrecked courtiers or -- avoidably -- cheeseball visual effects sending Ben Whishaws sprite Ariel zinging all over the place in superfast motion when hes not hovering in place like the Ziggy Stardust dress-up version of the ""2001"" Star Child.With her version of ""Titus Andronicus"" Taymor threw an awful lot at Shakespeare often stimulatingly. ""The Tempest"" may be the work of a more seasoned artist but it lacks a creative reason for being beyond turning Prospero into a woman (good idea; not the first time its been done but a good idea) and teasing out the sadness in the finale. Moody American actors (David Strathairn Chris Cooper) share the screen with more exuberant performers from England (Alfred Molina Russell Brand) or Scotland (Alan Cumming that shameless focus-stealer) or Benin by way of Paris (Djimon Hounsou) and never fully cohere as an ensemble. Mirren is excellent throughout formidable in both anger and forgiveness. Yet Taymors antsiness does the star no favors. Its only in the occasional extended takes that Mirren actually gets something going with the role.""The Tempest"" like all Shakespeares late romances resists neatness; it is a masque (it also features one Prosperos gift to the moony young lovers) full of wonderful irreconcilable differences. Id see Taymors film again sometime for her closing-credits images of loss. They are purely cinematic in a way that comes naturally and expressively out of her decades of theatrical magic. Taymors best known for the stage edition of ""The Lion King""; her ""Spider-Man"" musical opens next month in New York. She tackled ""The Tempest"" on stage years ago.

Bard buffs are likely to love it despite the liberties it takes. Others should understand that The Tempest long prized as Shakespeares poetic farewell to his stage career has little external action after the opening storm at sea. This tale of revenge and forgiveness largely takes place in the soul of its leading character Prospero.Or in Taymors movie Prospera. The writer-director has changed the gender of the former Duke of Milan and cast Oscar winner Helen Mirren. A treacherous brother (Chris Cooper) and his allies long ago deposed Prospera and banished her and her small daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) to a desert island.Prospera however is a sorceress. When the evildoers happen to sail nearby she creates a magical tempest and sinks their ship. They are now in her power. She can do what she wants to them - and reclaim her dukedom.Taymor is best known for her stage work The Lion King and the Spider-Man musical about to open on Broadway. Her movies such as Frida and Shakespeares Titus have largely depended on eye-popping color schemes. For The Tempest though she keeps the visuals low-key the dullish blues of sky and sea against the blacks and browns of most of the costumes and the volcanic terrain. The music by Elliot Goldenthal (Taymors husband and frequent collaborator) adds to the moods of supernatural mystery and solemnity.The directors most controversial innovation - casting Mirren - is a complete success. After winning awards for playing two Queen Elizabeths this actress has no problem projecting authority. Her obsession with Mirandas virtue when the shipwrecked Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) falls in love with the girl seems eminently natural for a mother as well.The most brilliant insights in this Tempest movie come from Prosperas relationships with her two servants. Almost everything the spirit Ariel (Ben Whishaw) does at his mistresss bidding is via CGI - Taymors other potentially controversial decision. Admittedly some of the animation borders on the cheesy. Most of it though illuminates the play in ways no stage production ever could. That includes the title storm of course but also the scary Harpy that Ariel becomes when terrifying the bad guys and the metaphysical light show with which Prospera entertains the young lovers.Prosperas stressful management of the brutal Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) is even more of a revelation. It doesnt take a degree in Jungian psychology to see Caliban as Prosperas shadow side The evidence is right there in the text. Taymor and Mirren clarify Prosperas ambivalence toward Caliban in many subtle ways. It helps that Hounsou speaks Calibans poetry - some of the most beautiful in the play - so eloquently.Hounsou is wonderful in his byplay with the two clowns beautifully individualized by Russell Brand and Alfred Molina. Lots of Shakespeares jokes have lost their ability to make us laugh because we no longer understand the topical references or even the meaning of the words. The funny parts of The Tempest on the other hand are mostly about drunkenness and stupidity. Those never go out of date.Directed by Julie TaymorStarring Helen Mirren Ben Whishaw Djimon Hounsou Felicity Jones Chris Cooper Alan Cumming Russell Brand and Alfred MolinaRun time 109 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (some nudity suggestive content scary images) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The effects are dazzling the cast is stellar the play is timeless the movie is wretched. Director Julie Taymor attacks ""The Tempest"" as if shes pursuing a Lifetime Achievement Award for discordant special effects. The play is a cyclone of wizardly imagery and the filmmakers take that as license for mad visual excess. The result isnt just over-the-top. Its over-the-top-of-the-top. Marooned in the eye of this storm-tossed production and striving heroically to rescue it is Helen Mirren stupendous as the sorceress Prospera. In this gender-shifting adaptation the plays male protagonist has become a duchess of Milan now exiled to a barren island with her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones). Their companions are the air spirit Ariel (Ben Whishaw) and earthy deformed Caliban (Djimon Hounsou). A shipwreck brings ashore King Alonso (David Straithairn) who banished Prospera and his son Prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) the man of Mirandas dreams. Taymor who came to prominence with her stylized puppet-theater staging of Disneys ""The Lion King"" (and is currently struggling to salvage her troubled Broadway Spider-Man musical) tells the tale by rote. Her work here isnt experimental merely showy. Lacking the parlor tricks available to filmmakers Shakespeare had to rely on genius. His play with its thicket of dramatic comic fantastic and romantic plots soars on the power sweep and multilayered density of exquisite poetry. Taymor too rarely employs her most magical special effect Mirrens face in close-up. She has the gorgeous diction that brings Elizabethan language to life and a gift of almost telepathic expressiveness. The same cant be said for Straithairn who coasts through his role like a fogbound ship on auto-pilot. Hounsou mostly bellows his lines at top volume while Whishaw lisps and whispers. Of all the eclectic cast (including the simpering young lovers hambones Russell Brand and Alfred Molina as fools and Chris Cooper whose Missouri drawl mangles 17th-century speech) Whishaw is the unluckiest. Taymor filmed him separately from Mirren optically combining their performances after the fact. This allows the nude Whishaw to flutter around the screen like Tinker Bell but kills whatever spark the actors might have generated through physical interplay. Elliot Goldenthals overbearing guitar-rock soundtrack swamps Whishaws speeches. And Taymor outfits him with bared prosthetic breasts for half his scenes to accentuate Ariels androgynous nature. Thanks for the visual but you shouldnt have. Really. Its yet another miscalculation in a film that should leave us bedazzled but merely renders us dazed.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Julie Taymor has the rare and semi-precious gift of artistic vision unhampered by taste. Wherever she turns her indomitable will -- upon the Beatles in ""Across the Universe or the Bard in ""Titus the life of Frida Kahlo on film or the sorrows of young Spider-man on Broadway -- she dispenses high-minded excess yoked to mind-blowing production design. Her works are too much of a too muchness inventive without a sense of play creative without taking any joy in the creation. A comparison to Baz Luhrmann is useful Where Taymor self-consciously aestheticizes pop vulgarity a movie like ""Moulin Rouge just dives right in.""The Tempest is typical Taymor if in a minor key. Its late-inning Shakespeare filmed on the volcanic beaches of the Hawaiian isles and warmed by Dame Helen Mirren as the gender-switched Prospera magician and exiled monarch of the island. Those with very long memories may recall a 24-year-old Mirren frolicking nude on similar shores in 1969s ""Age of Consent. In that movie she was like Miranda and Ariel both and the recollection still seems to gleam impishly in Prosperas eyes.But theres vengeance and mercy to dispense a daughter to marry off a sprite to free. Having arranged the shipwreck of King Alonso of Milan (David Strathairn) his ardent young son Prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) and Duke Antonio (Chris Cooper) Prosperas treacherous brother the mage leads them all astray through the wilderness. Ferdinand she brings to her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) and tests them both she for maturity and he for constancy. The love scenes in this ""Tempest have the right hushed emotional intimacy even if Ferdinand and Miranda have to sweat out their iambic pentameter on a field of volcanic scree. Carneys a plank a faded Orlando Bloom but Jones gets the headstrong watchful girl-child about to become a woman.The best sequences in ""Tempest are all quiet not that there are many of them. Any time Mirren settles in for a good ruminative soliloquy you can relax but Taymor keeps bringing on the banshees and the jesters. Our first sight of Russell Brand as Trinculo is a hoot -- he looks as if he has staggered in from the set of ""Get Him to the Globe -- but the ribald lowbrow slapstick with Stephano (Alfred Molina quite good) soon palls. Casting Brand turns out to have been a better idea than actually using him.And what are we to make of the movies Caliban? The role of Prosperas rebellious slave has often been played on stage by a black actor and anticolonialist interpretations have been around since the 1970s. Taymor uses Djimon Hounsous commanding physique and booming voice without any political subtext though -- without any subtext at all. And believe me its needed. Hounsou gives a solid performance but I think the last time we saw a black character pining for a virginal white girl before being chased off by dogs was ""Birth of a Nation.""The Tempest fares somewhat better with its Ariel played by Ben Whishaw as a sort of airborne David Bowie during his ""Aladdin Sane period. The character is sent this way and that with the aid of the latest in digital effects which means the movie will look dated by next month but at least Whishaw respects the text and his scenes with Mirren have a conspiratorial humor missing from the rest of the film.By making Prospero a woman Taymors ""Tempest invites a matriarchal reading one in which a powerful woman is marginalized by men until she can redress matters on her own turf. Mirrens a strong enough actress to make it work but the movie fritters away urgency pursuing its many tangents low comedy high romance political intrigue. Shakespeares final play was (among many other things) about resolving these genre strands in forgiveness and understanding. Taymor seems more interested in the strands.Nor does she throw away a single idea good or bad yet ""The Tempest still lacks the go-for-broke lunacy of the best gonzo Shakespeare -- follies like the 1935 film version of ""Midsummer Nights Dream or Luhrmanns ""Romeo+Juliet. (And lets carve a special pop niche for the 1956 sci-fi ""Tempest adaptation ""Forbidden Planet costarring the late Leslie Nielsen.) Taymor may be opening a new chapter in Shakespeare studies stodgy subversion.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Shakespeare drama drowns in Taymors Tempest | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShakespeare drama drowns in Taymors TempestThe inspired casting of Helen Mirren and a few imaginative visuals cant save a misguided production.Helen Mirren as Prospera with daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) in The Tempest.  (Melinda Sue Gordon / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 15 2010The Tempest (out of 4)Starring Helen Mirren Felicity Jones Djimon Hounsou and Ben Wishaw. Written and directed by Julie Taymor from the play by William Shakespeare. 109 minutes. At the TIFF Bell Lightbox.How now shall this be compassed?Twas reasonable obvious even for Julie Taymor to seek to apply her considerable decorative skills to Shakespeares The Tempest one of the Bards most visual plays -- and also his last as legend holds.Article Continued BelowIn her previous Shakespeare adaptation Titus and also in such pop-cult excursions as Across the Universe and the stage version of The Lion King Taymor has always offered interesting things to watch even if the story often went astray.One could also not fault her for thinking Helen Mirren would make a fine Prospero or rather Prospera. Mirren possesses the gravitas guile and good humour found in Shakespeares most intriguing character an island-dwelling sorcerer seeking redress for family treachery.Taymor doesnt even have to torture the text to make the gender switch succeed. The story now goes that Prospera became the Duchess of Milan after her husbands death but was banished to this distant isle with her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) by her scheming brother Antonio.So with so much going for it why does The Tempest become a mere storm in a teacup? The reasons are many.For starters the Hawaii-filmed visuals fail completely apart from the opening segment where Miranda a buck-toothed beauty holds a sand castle in her hand that melts from rain. From that ingenious curtain-riser we get the tepid sight of a harried Prospera attempting to control the not-so-raging heavens and seas with what looks like a black walking stick.Prosperas later conjuring of flames is equally lame seeming to be a barbecuing mishap rather than anything seriously dramatic. The visual failings are all the more noticeable since Taymors skimpy screenplay under-emphasizes Shakespeares powerful dialogue.Youd think with the CGI tricks available at her disposal that Taymor might have dreamed up something astounding to look it but sadly youd have thought wrong.Most disappointing of all is her clumsy green-screen rendering of Ben Whishaw as Prosperas androgynous spirit helper Ariel distractingly given bare breasts in some scenes whose appearances are often set to pounding rock music that is more the purview of bad rock videos.And CGI isnt necessary it must be said. The Stratford Ont. version of The Tempest starring Christopher Plummer which played to sold-out houses this past summer and which was captured by Barry Avrichs faithful film rendition needed nothing more than flapping curtains lights and sound to set nature roiling.Elsewhere the casting choices range from inspiring to insipid. The inspired include Djimon Hounsou as a black-and-white version of the man-monster Caliban who looks and acts appropriately feral earthy and vengeful -- Taymors imagination hasnt entirely failed her. Hounsou brings tension and tears to an often thankless role. Theres also a fine group in the shipwreck survivors Antonio (Chris Cooper) King Alonso (David Strathairn) Sebastian (Alan Cumming) and Gonzalo (Bill Conti). Its a great blend of American and British actors who together breathe life into a complicated collective often given short shrift.But then there are the insipid choices in particular Russell Brand as the comic relief character Trinculo. Dressing as he does on the streets of modern London he simply plays another version of his foppish Russell Brand persona that has rapidly become shopworn. Brand is paired with Alfred Molina who makes an okay drunkard Stephano but this is one comic duo that offers more groans that laughs.This leaves us with Reeve Carney as Ferdinand the wandering royal prince who becomes smitten with Miranda and vice-versa. Remember that soggy sandcastle at the start? That describes his chemistry with Miranda and also ultimately Taymors Tempest.Read more about William ShakespeareThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Photo From top David James/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures; Courtesy of Disney Enterprises; Lorey Sebastian/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) The Coens True Grit isnt as momentous an event as you might hope but once you adjust to its deliberate rhythms (it starts slowly) its a charming deadpan Western comedy. Its true that charming is an odd description for a picture with so much death and ghoulish imagery. But the Coens rarely get worked up about such things. Their gaze is steady serene. Roger Deakinss cinematography is beautifully deep-toned and austere; the compositions are clean even when the settings and characters are muddy. Hathaway shot the same old ArizonaNew Mexico buttes we know from other John Wayne movies but this True Grit is where it belongs in high deserts and forests denuded by winter. Carter Burwells elegiac score is built on Christian spirituals with a hint of Joplins piano rags to come. Its all played straightexcept when it comes to the actors. Bridgess Rooster is half-hidden behind unruly facial hair his cheeks reddened by burst blood vessels his one unpatched eye bleary. The actor has lowered his voice dropped it down into a pool of tobacco juice and phlegm and the words that come out are only semi-recognizable. It takes a while to warm up to this anti-Duke but the nice thing about Bridges is that he can wait. He catches you off guard with great Portis lines that Wayne threw away like Your partners killed you and Ive done for him. Matt Damons Texas Ranger LaBoeuf is a wonderful foil with his ostentatious jangling spurs and fringed jacket and ridiculous pipe. Hes a preener a kid playing dress-up but damned if he doesnt live up to his inflated self-image. Steinfeld is their straight man and I came to like her prim little unsmiling face and Gatling-gun delivery. It must have been hard to keep from laughing in the scene when Mattie finally comes face to face with her fathers murderer played by Josh Brolin as a bewildered troglodyte. What the hell is Brolin doing? I think I know. By this point in the film he has to out-grotesque an army of grotesqueries to make Joel and Ethan laugh. Although it falls off precipitously its better to have Julie Taymors The Tempest than not The first half-hour is nearly as unfettered as Shakespeares language. Shooting on Hawaiis Lanai where cliffs of volcanic rock border rainforest bordering desert Taymor suits the landscape to the words. Whenever the wizard Prosperoor as played by Helen Mirren Prosperasummons her enslaved spirit Ariel the screen goes electric with FX. Ben Whishaw is the genie of ones dreams semi-transparent his chiseled visage shifting in an instant from mischievousness to melancholy. He soars into the air leaving coils of himself in his wake then serenades the tempest-tossed (in songs set by Elliot Goldenthal) in an ethereal tenor. To think what Taymor might do with Puck or the three witches Even in those early scenes though there are signs of trouble. The landscape is so remarkable its hard to credit Prospera with stage-managing the shipwrecked partys illusory ordeals. And Mirren is small-scaled snippy without much variety or vocal power. Changing Prosperos sex has its ups and downs. Her brothers usurpation of her dukedom becomes an injustice against her womanhood which works fine. What doesnt is that this raging feminist would go on to use her magic to orchestrate the marriage of her naive daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) to Prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney). Wouldnt she want Miranda to exercise free will? I wouldbut Im biased. Jones is a dish and can speak the verse while Carney though pretty swallows his words and sings off-key. Miranda could do better. The Tempest is the most plotless of Shakespeares masterpieces and even the best productions have a hard time establishing a credible threat to Prosperos authority. The African-born Djimon Hounsou makes a grand entrance as Caliban rising nearly naked from the earth with patches of cracked soil in place of skin but hes stuck bellowing all his lines at the most misdirected troupe of comic-relief plotters (among them Russell Brand and Alfred Molina) in the annals of Shakespeare films. The drama is so muddled that Shakespeare seems to be getting in the way of Taymors spectacle the magic long gone by the time Prospera hurls her staff off into the sea. With a million times more computing power at its disposal than its 1982 predecessor Tron Legacy still looks like Disco Night at the jai alai fronton. Twenty- eight years later Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) the son of the originals Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) gets sucked into digital space where hes menaced by his fathers fascist digital double and spirited away by a gorgeous cat-eyed femme (Olivia Wilde) with a Louise Brooks do in a neon-outlined black bodysuit. (Patience Sam Flynnall your questions will be answered soon.) Given the strain of staring at this dim blue digital screen its no hyperbole to say that Wilde is a sight for sore eyes.

"The Tempest review A gender switch and other changes nearly sink Shakespeares seaside story |       NJ.com comments The Tempest review A gender switch and other changes nearly sink Shakespeares seaside story Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 10 2010 at 802 AM View/Post Comments Melinda Sue Gordon Helen Mirrens performance in the lead role is the best thing about a misguided new movie based on Shakespeares ""The Tempest."" Currently Julie Taymors ""Spider-Man"" musical is in previews on Broadway where early performances were marred by mishaps and several characters who were left literally hanging. Her film of ""The Tempest"" is just as storm-tossed. An overly free adaptation of Shakespeare its a wreck of clashing costumes diverse acting styles and (during the opening scenes) unintelligible dialogue sinking in a sea of overdone computer graphics. Only star Helen Mirren manages to swim to shore. Its an odd choice to begin with. A slight play ""The Tempest"" is held together only by a few lovely speeches and a message of forgiveness. The only movie to ever find any real pleasure in it was ""Forbidden Planet"" which turned helpful spirit Ariel into Robby the Robot and the sheltered Miranda into long-legged Anne Francis. ""The Tempest"" isnt quite as free with the text as that sci-fi classic but it takes its liberties. Too many in fact. The exiled magician Prospero is now Prospera. The play has been coldly cut. And nearly every change the supremely self-confident Taymor has made is the wrong one. Movie Review The Tempest ((PG-13) Touchstone/Miramax (110 min.)Directed by Julie Taymor. With Helen Mirren. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains a mostly blurred naked fairy. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS That gender-switching for example. In the original text having a suspicious father keeping his daughter under lock and key suggested all sorts of interesting conflicts and motivations. Making that parent a mother alters that in ways the rest of the movie doesnt reflect. Taymors visualization of Prospero/as magical helpers Ariel and Caliban meanwhile feels like its own evil trick. Ariel is meant to be an ethereal sprite; as portrayed here by Ben Whishaw all bed-head hair blurred genitals and disappearing/reappearing breasts the character seems to have come straight from the chorus line of some naughty ladyboy revue. Black actors have taken the role of Caliban the islands monster before; race helps underline the characters enslavement. But here Djimon Hounsou plays the fiend strictly for laughs and his sputtering wide-eyed cowardice is borderline offensive. And lets not dwell on Alfred Molina whos been given a song to sing and a pair of workingmans suspenders. Or Russell Brand flapping his gums and prancing about in a pair of striped Carnaby Street trousers. Mirren of course is wonderful -- in those few scenes when the CGI stops. But those rare moments are separated by tedious songs and far too many close-ups of Ariel laughing laughing laughing. You can imagine why Taymor was drawn to this play (and bent the genders). Prospero is a role the famously difficult director was born to play at least in her own mind -- the talent ahead of her time the misunderstood genius. Except shes not misunderstood -- thats the problem. And -- after ""Titus"" ""Frida"" ""Across the Universe"" and now this -- its becoming clear shes no genius either.

With Helen Mirren Russell Brand Alfred Molina. Director Julie Taymor (150). PG-13 Violence.Stage and screen director Julie Taymor doesnt need more bad news as her long-delayed ""Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark"" currently stumbles through Broadway previews. Still her new film version of Shakespeares ""The Tempest"" is less the opulent retelling she intended and more like a high-minded midnight movie filled with Rickys-style costumes black swans sprites that flit across the screen and a cave filled with boiling beakers.That caves resident sorceress in a gender switch from the Bards text is Prospera (Helen Mirren) a banished and wronged duchess from Italy with a lovely young daughter (Felicity Jones) a soul full of vengeance and two enslaved sprites at her disposal.The first of those is Ariel (Ben Whishaw) whose home is both water and air. The other is Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) made of earth and stone.After a storm at sea brings among others King Alonso (David Strathairn) and Prosperas duplicitous brother Antonio (Chris Cooper) to the island Ariel is enlisted to cause the kings men distress. As for the monstrous Caliban he finds a new master when he happens upon two other shipwreck survivors the drunken Stephano (Alfred Molina) and the oafish Trinculo (Russell Brand).Taymors visual pyrotechnics (used better in her 1999 Shakespeare adaptation ""Titus"") come across as forced dampening any warmth in Shakespeares final play. Mirren in her element -- strong sexy unsympathetic and vaguely sinister -- is a strong center and Molinas smirks can speak volumes. However Brand arrives dressed like Doctor Who and manages somehow to overplay a clown. Whishaw and Hounsou suffer through their tricky roles and Reeve Carney the webslinger in Taymors stage ""Spider-Man"" barely registers as the Kings dewy-eyed son Ferdinand.Most of the actors much-too-muchness fits with Taymors design. This is one ""Tempest"" though that is not the stuff as dreams are made on.

The comedy in ""The Tempest"" is more tedious than it is amusing.       Photo Touchstone Films Julie Taymors star- laden and utterly leaden film version of Shakespeares final play ""The Tempest"" was mysteriously chosen as the centerpiece of the New York Film Festival instead of say ""Black Swan."" Finally landing in theaters with a dull thud ""The Tempest"" is a surprisingly unengaging and charmless fantasy from a director whose previous films (""Across the Universe"" ""Titus"" ""Frida"") were despite their other issues never boring. This versions main twist -- never more than a gimmick really -- is to gender-bend the magician Prospero into a sorceress named Prospera. Shes been exiled from Milan with her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) to an island through the scheming of her brother (Chris Cooper) who has taken over as duke from Prosperas late husband. A dozen years later Prospera uses her powers to cause a tempest that strands her brother and the King of Milan (David Strathairn) on the island with a party that includes the kings son (Reeve Carney) who quickly becomes besotted by Miranda much to Prosperas consternation. As enacted by a pair of wooden juveniles this isnt exactly a riveting romance. The comedy -- though performed by such skilled hands as Russell Brand Alan Cumming and Alfred Molina -- is more tedious than actually funny. Taymor deploys Djimon Hounsous Caliban in a heavy-handed commentary on colonialism while Ben Whishaw is debatably even more annoying as the androgynous nude Ariel -- whose genitals have been removed using cheesy CGI. Filmed on volcanic Hawaiian locations that often resemble a studio back lot this is easily the worst movie version of ""The Tempest"" Ive seen. Paul Mazurskys 1982 contemporary version ""Tempest"" with John Cassavettes and Molly Ringwald is far better and the best is ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) which transported Shakespeare into the realm of 22nd century-set science fiction. Taymors version is more like a high school production of ""Mamma Mia"" with zippered costumes -- and minus the immortal songs of ABBA.

Starring Helen Mirren Felicity Jones Alfred Molina Alan Cumming and Russell Brand. Directed by Julie Taymor. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The rating notwithstanding Julie Taymors screen adaptation of Shakespeares ""The Tempest"" is not a mediocre film. It is by turns a great and awful film. Whats great is Helen Mirren as Prospero - or ""Prospera"" as she is known here a wizard in exile on a rugged island that she rules with magic. Whats awful is the rustic comedy which is always difficult but here its worse. Its unimaginatively staged and poorly acted by everyone involved especially Russell Brand who has never seemed so lost. So think of the movie as a personality test for viewers Is the glass half full or half empty? But no thats not the right analogy. Its more as if there were two glasses one half full of pig slop and the other half full of wine so delicious that you may very well remember the taste of it years later. Do you drink one glass to get to the other? Or do you pass? Those are your only choices until the DVD comes out. I must say that going into ""The Tempest"" I expected the Prospero sex change to be something on the order of a gimmick an example of celebrity casting masquerading as a feminist gesture. But no its inspired. Turning Prospero into a woman adds elements that are in harmony with the play and deepens those that are already there. The scenes between Prospera and Miranda become mother-daughter scenes and we feel the presence of a dark masculine world encroaching from all sides. Their vulnerability on that island becomes more acute and the circumstances that landed them there seem more than routine political intrigue. We feel in a way we rarely do with this play that a terrible crime has been committed - against a mother and her child and the Female Principle in general. All of this and more are present in Mirrens performance. This is a story about loss about wrongs that can be corrected and others that cant about time passing and the attempt to make things better for the next generation. An elegiac quality suffuses this story and there are lines and moments that as performed by Mirren are hot-wired to the human soul. You can watch any Helen Mirren film and she will always be impressive and engaging. Here shes moving - so full of wisdom strength and rueful understanding of lifes limits that she makes your breath catch in your throat. Not once or twice but again and again. Mirren is also in complete technical command of Shakespeares text precise in the language so that every word she utters is clear in its meaning. As such she lands every one of her jokes and turns acid observations into laugh lines because we know exactly and at all times what she is saying. Which leads us to Russell Brand a fine comedian and a good comic actor who has a mouthful of cotton and was ill served by being cast here. Brand should have been warned If youre in a Shakespeare play and they make your teeth look rotten the role is probably a stinker to begin with. Still Brand turns Trinculo into a form of torture. His speeches are a muddle and his physical comedy is disastrous. His performance is a grotesque attempt - not just his but Taymors - to take a public image and bend it into a Shakespearean performance. Brand tries. But for all his effort he might as well have been hitting himself with a baseball bat. The scenes of Trinculo and fellow rustic Stephano (Alfred Molina) baiting the monster Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) look like outtakes - three actors in a clearing trying to imitate and generate high spirits to no avail. Aside from some special effects involving the spirit being Ariel (played by Ben Whishaw as both lovely and spooky) the look of ""The Tempest"" is pretty bare bones for the visually gifted Taymor. One nice subtle effect presents a conversation between Miranda and her new boyfriend Prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) in which they sit on a rock incline. Everything in the frame including their faces is an earth tone. In that example the visuals have an indefinable emotional undercurrent while other scenes just look like actors stumbling around on rocks. The experience of ""The Tempest"" is of watching other actors run up a deficit of audience goodwill only to have Mirren pay it each time she comes back. Its worth mentioning that Mirren is beautifully paired with Felicity Jones who gives us a Miranda as naive and sweet as Mirrens Prospera is weary and wise. Miranda is the lines on Prosperas face the reason her mother has to worry and reckon with the past in order to win the future. -- Advisory This film contains lewd humor.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Tempest  out of four Stars Helen Mirren Ben Whishaw David Strathairn Djimon Hounsou Alan Cumming Chris CooperDirector Julie TaymorDistributor Touchstone PicturesRating PG-13 for some nudity suggestive content and scary imagesRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its not that theres anything wrong with adapting reimagining or gender-bending the works of William Shakespeare. In fact Helen Mirrens Prospera in The Tempest closely hues to the originals Prospero and her portrayal of the exiled ruler of Milan is nuanced and masterful. But the film simply doesnt come together fluidly. Smaller parts arent on par with the lead role and special effects are overdone and cheesy. At times the essence of Shakespeares poetry is drowned out. In the opening scene characters are confined to a boat and are fighting the elements. But the majesty of Shakespeares words is lost amid the noisy stormy special effects. Theres a lot of incoherent shouting more suited to The Perfect Storm than Shakespeares Tempest. INTERVIEW Mirren likes to shake it up Prospera was forced from rule in Milan by her brother Antonio (Chris Cooper) and now lives with her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) on a remote island. She conjures a storm and shipwreck to lure Antonio and others from her past and settle scores. With the aid of the sprite Ariel (Ben Whishaw) and native islander Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) Prospera manipulates and torments her tormentors. Mirren lends the role a complex blend of maternal tenderness and steely ferocity. Hounsou turns in a memorable performance. His Caliban is by turns menacing plaintive and funny. The role offers a subtext of colonialism and racial oppression. But Ariel given breasts to appear androgynous looks more like a Glitter Rock refugee than a mystical sprite. Director Julie Taymor (Frida) contributes her theatrical panache to the film and the cavernous ""cell"" in which Prospera and Miranda live is one of the most visually entrancing sets. But it isnt as wickedly mesmerizing as 1999s Titus. While costumes blend Elizabethan with contemporary looks -- classic ruffs and corsets are fashioned in black leather and zippers -- the production design is dull. Supporting characters such as Antonio and Sebastian (Alan Cumming) are convincing but Russell Brand as the clownish rogue Trinculo is a weak link. Where his preening rock star was the highlight of Forgetting Sarah Marshall it wore thin in Get Him to the Greek and is off-putting here. Mirren keeps the film on track. But incomprehensible shouting and pointless shenanigans obscure subtle moments. Despite a superb lead performance and unaided by thunderclaps and incarnations The Tempest is drizzly and drab.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Julie Taymor has earned a reputation as a tirelessly experimental director of both theatrical and cinematic projects. So what does it say that the most radical choice she makes in her adaptation of William Shakespeares The Tempest ends up barely mattering at all? The films Prospero long a role played by actors able to summon the power of a patriarch in autumn has become Prospera and is embodied by Helen Mirren. That gender reversal suggests far more possibilities than Taymor seems interested in exploring unless the point was simply to cast Mirren in the part and ignore gender altogether. That isnt a bad idea. Shes a remarkable actress and makes for a fine Prospera at once flinty and determined but with a pulsing parental tenderness she makes evident in lines that lesser actors might throw away. Ultimately Mirren makes recasting Prospero as a woman seem like not that radical a notion but neither are any of the choices Taymor makes here. Which is surprising given both her record and the readiness with which The Tempest lends itself to outre ideas with its monsters sprites and magic. Whats more it needs a little goosing to make it as a film. A treasure box of setpieces The Tempest doesnt offer much in the way of forward momentum. If every scene doesnt dazzle it can start to feel like a drag. Not every scene dazzles. In fact Taymor seems to have assembled an interesting cast and colorful costumes and chosen a fitting locale--some scenic forbidding corners of Hawaii--and hoped for the best. Occasionally she gets it. Playing Caliban with a West Indian accent and a patch of white skin that places the emphasis on the plays colonial themes Djimon Hounsou is effective in his tense exchanges with Mirren less so when thrown in with the comic relief played by Alfred Molina and Russell Brand (who doesnt stray too far from his familiar persona). And while the proudly artificial CGI effects Taymor favors are probably the contemporary equivalent of some of the gaudier theatrical pageantry of the Elizabethan stage that doesnt make the way Ben Whishaws Ariel flits and glows any less of an eyesore. But the best thing about Taymors Tempest is also the worst Its not stunning but it is sturdy a handsome-enough showcase of a film that never really comes to life. It plays like a challenge politely declined.

But this aloof spectacle oriented adaptation of The Tempest -- theatrically ambitious musically busy and in the end cinematically inert -- clearly reflects the authorship of myth-loving director Julie Taymor (currently preparing for the Broadway opening of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark). Taymor repositions Shakespeares mysterious story of magic revenge and forgiveness on a strange island by turning the plays vexed sorcerer Prospero into a sorceress Prospera played by Helen Mirren with moody feminist authority. The fragmented feeling of the production is amplified by the welter of performance styles among the other players including Russell Brand (cheeky) as the castaway Trinculo Djimon Hounsou (indecipherable) as the slave Caliban and Ben Whishaw (mercurial with a touch of the androgynous) as the spirit Ariel who does Prosperas bidding in the hope of gaining his freedom.

The duchess Prospera (Helen Mirren) has been forced into exile stripped of wealth and position by her scheming brother Antonio (Chris Cooper) whos branded her a witch by using her prodigious smarts against her. But her maligned gifts roar back with a vengeance. From the isolated island where she and her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) found both refuge and the slave Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) Prospera works her talent for magic to bring her foes to her for comeuppance. The visuals are alternately inspired and horrible (dated CGI) never approaching the giddy anachronism of Taymors cinematic debut Titus (another Shakespeare adaptation). Mirrens fierce intelligence illuminates Prospera and Ben Whishaws Ariel has a skittish puppy quality but Hounsous awful line readings flatten the impact of his casting which was seemingly meant to underscore the colonial tensions in Calibans tale (for instance the slave is plied with booze by white simpletons he mistakes for gods). Seventies-rock aesthetics run wild--Russell Brand as Trinculo in tight striped pants and a flowing scarf looks like a Led Zeppelin refugee; Ariel an androgyne with small breasts evokes gender-fuck glam; and Reeve Carneys Ferdinand comes off like a hipster doing retro. For all that the film lacks a pulse. Theres sound and fury but the result is more drizzle than tempest.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 16 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday Dec. 15 2010 326PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Sad news for Bard watchers Julie Taymors adaptation of William Shakespeares The Tempest is not such stuff as dreams are made on. Taymor known for her lively theatrical production of The Lion King and the films Titus Frida and Across the Universe promised to bring something new to Shakespeares island fantasy on the 400th anniversary of his farewell play. With a cast that includes Helen Mirren in the gender-adapted role of ""Prospera"" and an international ensemble including David Strathairn Chris Cooper Alfred Molina Djimon Hounsou and Russell Brand her new production comes with a tingle of high expectations. The results are more like a lass and a lack. Apart from the cut-rate-looking computer-generated imagery and its Hawaiian setting this Tempest is just another example of middling muddled Shakespeare a far less dynamic adaptation than Taymor managed in Titus her 1999 version of Titus Andronicus. Even the casting of the central character as a woman has little resonance. Mirren wearing no makeup dressed mostly in masculine clothes proves as flinty as any wronged male ruler and as protective of her daughters chastity. A scholar and master of magic the former Duchess of Milan was cast out by usurpers and has lived on her island for a dozen years with her now teenaged child Miranda (Felicity Jones). Keeping them company are two indigenous slaves the shape-shifting spirit Ariel (Ben Wishaw) and a mud-caked monster Caliban (Hounsou). As the story begins Prospera conjures up a tempest causing her old enemies to be shipwrecked on her island. One group of survivors includes Prosperas treacherous brother Antonio (Cooper) King Alonso (Strathairn) the kings foppish brother Sebastian (Alan Cumming) and the kindly windbag Gonzalo (Tom Conti). On another part of the island Prospera and Ariel have fun tormenting a couple of drunken fools Stephano and Trinculo (Molina and Brand) who fall in with the resentful Caliban. On a third front Prospera arranges a romance between Miranda and the kings son Ferdinand (Reeve Carney currently starring in Taymors Spider-Man musical on Broadway) another survivor of the shipwreck. Back and forth we go between the nobles the low characters and back to Prospera delivering new orders to Ariel. The effect is disjointed with a hodgepodge of visual ideas which range from arresting - the black lava fields on the Hawaiian island of Lanai - to absurd. Skinny and white Wishaw as Ariel looks like an early-seventies David Bowie but taken one step further. His genitals have been CGId out and he has pubescent breasts that come and go as he flits around the screen like an overcaffeinated bat. Other lapses include the fourth-act wedding masque where instead of the spectacle of ancient pagan goddesses we get what looks like a mildly dated planetarium show. A pack of dogs that Prospera conjures to torment the clown characters consists of plump Rottweilers with special-effects flames around their backsides. All this might be easier to accept if the film re-awakened the plays language and theatrical themes but the performances are simply too inconsistent to make it come alive. Most of the other actors fall below Mirrens standard. Strathairn and Cooper are earnest and decent but caught in mid-Atlantic no-mans land. Hounsous Caliban looks physically magnificent but tends to roar his speeches. As for the stunt casting of Russell Brand he plays Russell Brand again but its less funny than usual. Taymor takes a screenplay credit here for the cuts and minor changes but theres nothing revolutionary in her adaptation. The attention to the suppression of the womens knowledge is referred to but not developed. The decision to cast an African-born actor as Caliban conforms to more than a half-century of postcolonial interpretations of the play. Instead of conjuring up a new vision of The Tempest Taymor seems to have taken the original and pasted on some distracting computer-generated glitter dust.

TWITTER Shakespeare lovers will be divided on Julie Taymors flashy-smooth adaptation of the Bards great and possibly last comedy. Far less daring than her 1999 ""Titus"" which took an electrifying stylized approach of a lesser-known play ""The Tempest"" in comparison looks disappointingly middle-of-the-road. Even the great Helen Mirren who usurps the masculine lead as Prospera is steady and reliable but unexciting. But this attractive and easy-to-digest production full of music special effects and musical dialogue likely will fulfill many viewers expectations and ring up more business than a revolutionary version. That brings to mind Derek Jarmans 1979 adaptation an iconoclastic struggle to reconcile Shakespeare with cinematic language which concluded with a joyous jazz rendition of Stormy Weather. Quite a different approach to the present film. The fact that Taymor is known for inventive groundbreaking -- from her stage direction of The Lion King to her Beatles salute Across the Universe -- throws into relief how little effort has gone into rethinking the play compared to the enormous and visible production work. Sent into exile 12 years earlier when her ambitious brother Antonio (Chris Cooper) usurped her kingdom to become the Duke of Milan Prospera and her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) have lived on an enchanted island ever since served by two slaves the brutish Caliban (Djimon Hounsou) and his opposite number the romantic wind sprite Ariel (Ben Whishaw). Prospera is a powerful sorceress who can calm a raging storm at sea with a flick of her wand. Actually it was she who created the storm and a dramatic shipwreck which sweeps to the island her old enemies including bad bro Antonio Alonso the King of Naples (a nobler-than-thou David Strathairn) and his brother Sebastian (a foppish Alan Cumming). They make fun of Prosperas old friend the good Gonzalo (Tom Conti) as they explore the island. Like a stand-in for Shakespeare Prospera runs the show putting actors on- and offstage at her pleasure. With Ariels help she keeps the noblemen from killing one another while she arranges for the kings callow son Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) to fall in love with wide-eyed Miranda. Meanwhile she prepares her own revenge and comeback for the final scenes. The island where Tempest takes place is as magical as the play itself and Taymor underscores the dramatic and varied beauty of the Hawaii locations. But Stuart Dryburghs cinematography often fails to transform the bright Hawaiian sunshine into mystery leaving faces and vegetation disquietingly au naturel. In contrast the visual effects work led by Kyle Cooper sets off fantasies rich and strange. Most of these involve Ariel who gets star billing with his delicate way of speeding through the sky leaving a trail of afterimages and channeling natural forces to do Prosperas bidding. His transformation into a frightful Harpy tormenting the foolish nobles is a very effective scene. As a reward for his service hes promised his freedom. Boss lady makes no such promise to the charmless ""moon calf"" Caliban covered with black-and-white patches of dried mud to emphasize his earthy nature in case someone missed it. Hounsous anger against her haughty colonialism certainly is powerful but his claim to be the rightful owner of the island elicits little sympathy especially after he adopts two comical sailors (Russell Brand as Trinculo and Alfred Molina as Stephano) as his gods. As the young lovers Jones and Carney are the picture of innocence and their attractively modern faces seem ready to burst into a Beatles ballad at any second. With charming ease Jones delivers some of the plays best lines like the ""O brave new world that has such creatures in it"" speech. In cropped gray hair and mannish pants Mirren is an androgynous asexual sorceress whose cold weathered face recalls that she has acquired her magic the hard way plugging away at thick books while insisting on her right to study in a mans world. In her hands is the theme of power its uses and abuses recalling with a sigh her tour-de-force performance in The Queen. Often the filmmakers appear unable to resist irritating cleverness like anachronistically costuming the rich people from Milan in black suede zipper jackets that look fresh off the catwalk. These stylish costumes which might look great on a theater stage are much too foregrounded in a film in which they feel like an overextended gag. Similarly many of the films visual ideas are dishearteningly theatrical like the last set in Prosperas weird-looking castle. True to her musical origins Taymor injects several haunting sung interludes most notably Whishaws performance of ""Full fathom five thy father lies"" set to music by Elliot Goldenthal.

As if it were not disappointing enough to produce an intellectually undernourished version of Shakespeares late romance helmer Julie Taymor has gone one better by crafting a ""Tempest"" so kitschy yet curiously drab and banal that even supporters may hope shell break her staff and drown her book. With a tony cast led by Helen Mirren in the gender-bent lead role the Touchstone release skedded to bow in December could find a niche among older auds and those who cant be bothered to read the play. Shakespeares 400-year-old text of ""The Tempest"" arguably the last written solely by him centers on Prospero a scholarly nobleman genius with magical alchemical powers whos been banished from his rightful realm to a nearly deserted island. The many specifically theatrical references threaded throughout suggest Shakespeare intended it as his own swan song making Prospero his mouthpiece as he bids farewell at the end to a quasi-artistic career. (Throughout the play Prospero manipulates the other characters very much the writer-helmer of the proceedings with assistance from spirit sidekick Ariel.) Its therefore no surprise that such maverick filmmakers as Derek Jarman and Peter Greenaway have been drawn to the material using it as a prism to refract their own interests. Despite the liberties taken with the material other directors have at least engaged with the teeming fertility of the play a text so layered and crystalline with ambiguity it can be reinterpreted in multiple contradictory ways every generation. For example 19th century interpretations saw in ""The Tempest"" an allegory of strict but benevolent colonialism; since the 1970s both legit and film talents inspired by academic readings have preferred to read against the grain of the text finding in the enslaved Caliban a tragic figure victimized by Prosperos imperialist ambitions and robbed of his own language like many conquered indigenous people around the globe. Theres a bit of that post-colonialist spin here in Taymors version but its a poor bare forkd thing. As Caliban Benin-born Djimon Hounsou plays up his native African accent and moves with the squatting theatrical menace of a shaman conjuror but Taymors direction doesnt free the character from the comedy shackles Shakespeare imprisoned him in originally. The helmers casting of Mirren in the lead role necessitates renaming the character Prospera and inserting some blank verse to explain she was the rightful ruler of Milan after her husbands death later banished with daughter Miranda (played adequately as an adult by Felicity Jones) by her treacherous brother Antonio (Chris Cooper). The sexual reassignment while thought-provoking plays like a gimmick. It doesnt help that Mirren usually so good appears to be on autopilot including her reading of the famous ""Our revels now are ended..."" soliloquy. The charged father-daughter dynamic is made completely nonsensical by the recasting; with this one change Taymor takes more away than she can replace. The wooden Reeve Carney (as Ferdinand) and stunt-cast Russell Brand (as clown Trin-culo) aside the ensemble should have repped a strong lineup but no one gets much of a chance to blossom. Ben Wishaws Ariel compellingly androgynous despite the silly Aladdin Sane haircut comes close but his sequences are hobbled by the pics cheesy CGI. Per the press notes all Wishaws scenes were shot in a studio using greenscreen which would be fine had the visual effects team done a better job of matching his eyeline with Mirrens. Elsewhere the Alonso-Sebastian-Antonio-Gonzalo quartet (played by David Strathairn Alan Cumming Cooper and Tom Conti) who wander around the island plotting against each other and chattering hold up their end of the drama sturdily but its not enough. Lenser Stuart Dryburgh whose work with Jane Campion in particular has been so outstanding lights the locations dingily. A drab limited palette is deployed to no great effect hampering the efforts of costume designer Sandy Powell whose outfits made almost entirely from sewn-together zippers nevertheless add a contempo edge imaginatively reworking a recent trend in high fashion deployed by Balmain among others.
